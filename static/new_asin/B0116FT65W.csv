7328746,5,B0116FT65W,"While yet to be released (coming this September!), this is the original FMA 2003 remastered from standard definition -> high definition. I own the FMA Brotherhood BluRay set and I am very excited to add this to my collection. The show follows the Elric brothers on their journey to find the Philosophers stone, a stone that can perform transmutations (converting one object into something else) with no equivalent exchange. It has a fantastic story with a wonderful mix of light-hearted comedy, but also plenty of heart-wrenching moments.

There are two Fullmetal Alchemist shows (FMA 2003 and FMA Brotherhood). The difference? When FMA 2003 was being created, it caught up to the manga. Instead of waiting for the manga to finish, the writers diverged from the manga's plot and wrote it's own ending (FMA Brotherhood stays true to the manga). Do not let the divergence from the manga sway you, this is truly an amazing anime that is worth your time.

Around the first 20 episodes of FMA follow along similarly to FMA B, but there are subtle (important differences). The original FMA spends more time building up Ed & Al's personality and gives you more insight to the characters and their relationships; but after these initial episodes, the plots are completely different. Also, there is a follow-up movie for FMA called Conquerer of Shambala which completely wraps up the FMA story.

I would whole-heartedly recommend this anime, whether you've never watched an anime or if you're an avid viewer. After finishing FMA, be sure to watch Conquerer of Shambala, and then FMA Brotherhood!",1439078400,67,1586,5.022813688212928
7328747,5,B0116FT65W,Not as good as Brotherhood (just my opinion) but still an awesome show none the less.,1512345600,,85,4.375
7328748,3,B0116FT65W,"This is the full series, but there are audio issues with the episodes. The volume fluctuates wildly, sometimes within one character's lines. It can go from very hard to hear to way too loud within a few seconds. In addition, the Fullmetal Alchemist popup is annoyingly present after transitions.",1508025600,,295,5.040816326530612

7328760,4,B0116FT65W,"Wow, this has gone up in price since I bought it.

Won't lie, I liked Brotherhood better, but that does not detract from this version.  It's still a fantastic story and well worth the time to watch.  I actually recommed watching it up to fifth lab arc before switching to five episodes into Brotherhood because this does a much better beginning.",1493078400,,345,4.622950819672131

7328768,3,B0116FT65W,"I usually enjoy anime that has physically imperfect people living normal lives and not feeling helpless or depicting them as ""special"" or ""burdensome"".  Edward's main goal is to get back his limbs and his brother's entire body back to normal. The emotions and actions of the other characters are very real to life.  *(A caution to some, there are some rather sad/ sadistic like moments that not everyone is comfortable with. There are times when I have to turn down the volume due to intense momentary screaming. There are a few times when children are depicted as suffering momentarily. Also there are some bad words used but I don't think any name is taken in vain if I recall correctly)*

Comparing this series to the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood series, which follows the manga more closely, I prefer brotherhood to this, the original. This one seems a little darker in personality and I laughed less. There are more sadistic moments in this one as well. There are a different characters or characters with different roles and back grounds. I prefer the characters, and interactions, and relationships in brotherhood better. There are a few scenes or episodes which compliment brotherhood.",1482796800,,1196,5.03030303030303

7328770,3,B0116FT65W,"Grew up watching this show, I love it so much. But I personally gave 3 stars.... because buying this set in blue ray, I expected it to have upgraded to wide screen, which it is not, it has the small square(dont know what the pciture is called. Also the subtitles do not work... I would not recamend buying this as the blue ray set. Quality is only of dvd, so don't waste your money. Just buy the dvd set.",1480118400,,404,4.1265822784810124

7328773,1,B0116FT65W,"Amazon has Deleted this review now, 18 times!!!
But I will NOT be Dissuade.
The People Must Know the Truth!!!

They even keep deleting my Detailed Photos.
I had SCREENSHOTS, people!!!
Actual Screenshots of the Image Quality.
Why did you delete them, Amazon!?!?!?
------------------------------------------------

The instant I opened the Shipping box, I see that My FMA Case looks to be Missing something.
The Cardboard Slip Cover, that is clearly in Everyone Elses Reviews.

See the Slip Cover in other peoples reviews?
I don't know where they got those, but I bought mine NEW, from ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"".
And yet, I did NOT recieve this Mystical Cover, that everyone else seems to have Recieved.

As for Picture Quality:

No English Subtitles. You can see from my Screenshots; Everything is in Japanese.

Granted, the Images are not Out-stretched, Dispixelated & Distorted.
The Images actually look good, but I don't understand 1 thing.
You can see my screenshots, where they chose to over-impose a NEW set of HD text (lettering) on certain scenes.
But they didn't apply this princible to the WHOLE show.
They merely Up-scaled the Drawn scenes, but completely re-did the Fonts.

That makes no Sense to me.
That's the Very Definition of ""Half-[...]"".

And just a Heads up:
It's Not Widescreen (16x9).
It's Fullscreen (4:3).
And that is the very Essence of ""NOT BLU-RAY"".
Blu-Ray is 1920x1080p, but these are 1920x1440p.

I understand that some people like the ""ORIGINAL""-thing...
But the Purpose of going Blu-Ray, is to have HD Widescreen.
Or at the very least, give us the Option to select WIDE or FULL in the Disc Menu.
But no, we can't even Get That...

The show is Great, Sure.
But the Blu-ray Conversion is Crap.

And that is the Basis for my Review.
Wheather or not the Blu-Rays are Worth it.
Plain and Simply:

No.

Buy an ""Upscaler DVD player"" for your DVD version, and you'll have the Same Product.
Plus, you can make all your OTHER dvds look better, too.
PLUS, you'll have English Subtitles.",1474502400,3,2012,4.882352941176471
7328774,5,B0116FT65W,"so i over heard a guy at my local k mart saying how batman and superman was the best cartoon of all time and he was quickly to scof at anime as porn...i guess he NEVER HERD OF FULLMETAL ALCEMEST!!!!!!!!!!!!! (or any others for that matter)

this is one of the greatest anime of all time and will be remembered forever like classics like speed racer, mobile suit gundam, dragon ball z, and MANY MANY MANY MANY OTHERS!!!!!!! if your not an anime fan this this is a good one to start at

and youl see that anime is an art

7328776,4,B0116FT65W,"I wish that this was actually upscaled to HD, but I knew ahead of time that it wouldn't be, and have since read about why that is so difficult to do for animation, so I can't really be upset. That being said, this is one of the best animes of all time, and I am stoked to own it physically to show my children one day. This is essential viewing.",1473724800,,345,3.942857142857143
7328777,4,B0116FT65W,"Great series.  Watch in Japanese.  The English dub is horrendous.

7328778,5,B0116FT65W,Great series a little on the dramatic side at times but beautiful story and animation noe the less. Get this now while it is still pretty reasonably priced as funimation no longer has the fma liscense and these sets have been discontinued. Amazon just happens to have a little bit in stock still at the time of this review the set goes for $49 from amazon i got mine for $39.99 either way thats still the cheapest price for this set anywhere online.,1472428800,8,449,4.421686746987952

7328780,4,B0116FT65W,"Do note that this is the original series and NOT Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood( the newer version ). Anyways, I absolutely loved the entire series. It is one of the best dubbed animes out there, and the show sticks to the main story each episode unlike other well known series. It's only 51 episodes so it isn't a run-on anime with no end in sight. However, the ending was a bit abrupt (otherwise this would have earned a 5 Star rating) and I would suggest buying the movie, FMA: The Conqueror  of Shamballa, that follows the series. Besides that, awesome anime. A must buy for anime fans and beginners alike.",1471305600,,612,4.614678899082569

7328785,1,B0116FT65W,"Not a great quality item...
It looks as if they took the tv version... And cut out any commercials. Leaving the random pop ups mid episode since they couldn't cut those out.. Disappointing. Might as well watch online for free instead of spending 40$ on a lie",1468108800,,258,4.51063829787234
7328786,5,B0116FT65W,The most amazing anime I've ever seen and in my opinion better than FMA Brotherhood,1466553600,,83,4.6

This also comes with and envelope with ten image cards,three large image cards with transmutation seals on them, and a three hundred page art book.

7328806,2,B0116FT65W,"The series itself is fantastic, but false advertising by Funimation forces me to give this a 2 star. I am partially deaf and need the English subtitles to follow along with the voices.  Even if they don't follow it perfectly, it gives me a good idea over just trying to hear what everyone is saying.  Funimation advertises this to have English subtitles, but what they fail to mention is that it is locked to the Japanese audio only.  The DVD series didn't have this issue/lockout and that does deserve the 5 stars.  I didn't have a choice but to return this.  I hope funimation changes their advertising for this as it'll be difficult for me to buy any future Blu-Rays from them not knowing for sure i'll get the subtitles I want and what's labeled on the box.
Like I said, the series itself, is fantastic, but since this is a review of the Blu Ray series, I can't give it a high score.",1456185600,20,887,4.384146341463414

If you've haven't read/seen the previously mentioned, I would say save your money and get Brotherhood instead since while it lacks comparatively in some aspects, its is overall the superior story with an actual ending.

The case is a hard sturdy material yet removing the DVD's from the cases may be a problem as you have to press down firmly on the middle 'button' with your thumb and use your remaining fingers to carefully lift the DVD from the insert. That can be a problem with many DVD's however, it is also a good thing as you can rest assured that the disc will not become dislodged within the case due to the sturdy holding.

The artwork presented on the cover (as you see from the picture) is nostalgic for all Full Metal Alchemist fans. You will find the two main characters presented on the covers (slipcover/case). It is highly detailed and on the back of the case are the general descriptions and blurbs of the television show including the special features and what else you can come to expect from the DVD's themselves.

The DVD's have artwork of their own which are symbolic of the show: (a red) Alchemy transmutation circle.

When you insert the DVD/Blu-ray into your compatible player whether it's a Playstation or XBOX console, PC, etc., you will be confronted with various anime trailers before getting to home menu. On the menu, you will have a static screen with familiar music as the background (original song from FMA original soundtrack). You will be able to choose between subtitles, Japanese/English voice audio and a textless opening among other things. There's isn't much that 'stand out' about this product but whether you're new to the series or a longtime fan, I'd recommend adding this to your collection (with such a reasonable price)! While this is the series that diverged from the path the manga was headed, I do recommend checking out the second of this series: Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood which follows the manga plot intently.",1451174400,6,2080,4.798882681564246

Must buy for any anime fan. The brothers bond is so good. What they sacrifice for each other and people they love. Some parts will make you sad with a lot of the deaths. You really feel for them.

This being not only the first bluray release of the original FMA anime but also the first time it was released in one complete package I very much wanted it. I preordered it and it came in today. The show itself was great. Usually it's people opinions on which series was better. This one or Brotherhood. I say watch this first sense this version does a lot of character focus, making you love them more. Then watch Brotherhood. And the package itself was very pretty and nice. It came with another item so the corners of mine were a bit roughed up. It comes on 6 discs and are about the same thickness of any of the brotherhood Volumes. I think it's a great edition to my bluray anime collection and I recommend it :) hope this helped!

7328861,4,B0116FT65W,"What I love about anime is they will explore themes and ideas no Western show would touch (at least in its elaborate details).  Full Metal is ripe with fascinating concept - immortality, God, life and death, loyalty, the ends justify the means, and family.  Some of these may seem like generalities, but I assure you that the show cuts into these concepts like a surgical tool and leaves the viewer pondering their own viewpoints.

Here is why I am not awarding it the full 5 stars:  The comedy sometimes derails/distracts from these powerful images.  I LOVE Deathnote and Attack on Titan - both of which use comedy sparingly throughout.  Yet, aside from maybe ONE episode where there's silliness galore, neither of those is weighted down by bits of light comedy.  Full Metal's use is sometimes so overpowered that it makes characters seem unintelligent and downright trivial to the main plot.  However, those same characters later come in and do something that shapes the destinies of all the characters.  Imagine if Yoda (originals) started rapping or making silly gestures, his significance in Empire would wash away the dark tones throughout.  Unfortunately, Full Metal does not restrain itself enough from reaching the same heights as Titan and Deathnote",1442707200,,1259,5.067961165048544

7328864,5,B0116FT65W,"This is so much more than just a show. That first episode watched, all those years ago, the countless hours spent in front of the tv... this is no mere instance of squandered youth and wasted time, this show was and is a catalyst for change in my life.

I watched the show alongside my brother, and we could relate well to the Elrics. My brother, both older and smaller than I, had a quick temper, much like Ed, whereas I more easily identified Al. We both were young in our teenage years, emerging from a childhood where we too had lost a parent. We were no strangers to difficult times, no paucity of adversity in our lives, and Ed and Al helped us to feel less alone in our struggles. Much in the same way they studied their alchemy, we were inspired to pursue the sciences. Ed and Al taught us not just to be better brothers to one another, but to be better people in general. This show is chock full of good messages and good philosophy. It molded me as a youth, it shaped my understanding of consequence, and helped me come to terms with some of life's hard truths. It sounds silly, to be so affected by a television show, but I would say it's similar to the feeling you get when a certain song moves your soul, and I would challenge anyone who says there is nothing to be learned here.

This show exemplifies the finest of storytelling. I feel sorry for those that would, so to speak, judge this book by its cover. This is not simply some cartoon for children, this show is a life lesson, and it can change you for the better if you let it. I am glad for the opportunity to buy a remastered copy. It will make a good gift to my brother. Hopefully someday his kids and my kids will be able to enjoy this show on the same level as we did.",1442188800,36,1743,4.184523809523809

8723677,5,B0116FT65W,"Fullmetal Alchemist is a fantastic TV show that I highly recommend. There, thats it  you need nothing else, just go watch it. OK, so this wouldnt be a very good review if I just stopped there, but in all seriousness, this show is amazing. I don't care if you don't like anime or prefer English dubs, this show deserves a watch. The show deals with the two Elric brothers, Ed and Al, and their quest to find the mystical Philosophers Stone, while also studying the powerful science known as alchemy  they're searching for this because of a mistake they made when they were younger and the permanent consequences that were wrought. While I know that this show came out first, I watched Avatar: The Last Airbender long before getting around to this and I think that the best way to think of the shows use of alchemy is to think of the Avatar worlds bending  there is certainly much more to the worlds of both, but they both have these central components. Obviously, theres more to the story than this, but I don't want to mention more because that spoils the fun, so Ill just get right down to what the shows strength and weakness are. Firstly, the characters are superb.

 There are very few shows that I have seen that have made me not only deeply care for the main characters very much, but almost every character in the show as if they were all main characters. Ed and Al are the protagonists and they not only make a great duo because of their brotherly camaraderie, but also as standalone characters; Ed is the older (but shorter) brother who has to make many tough choices throughout the series, while also trying to retain some sense of youthful optimism, and Al is the younger brother who tries his best to help out in situations because hes not as hotheaded as his brother. Both of these characters are not only entertaining, but complex, especially Ed  part of this is due to the acting. I have to give special mention to Vic Mignognas portrayal of Ed, as it includes some of the best voice-acting Ive ever heard. When Ed is frustrated, you feel the anger; when he is sad, you feel the anguish; when he is unsure about what to do next; you feel the confusion. I watched the entire show dubbed in English, so I cant comment on how accurate it is to the Japanese version, but from what Ive read, the general consensus seems to be that it is one of the better anime dubs  from just a voice-acting perspective, it certainly passes my bar. So, the main characters are great, but what about the side characters, how are they? Oh boy, they're fantastic, too.

 Even though the emotional crux of the entire series rests on the two brothers and both of those characters are great, I think that the side characters are just as good as them. The series takes its time to really develop many of them so that you feel just as attached to them as you do to the two leads. For example, there is a military group (friendlies) that is eventually comprised of roughly ten people, and this group consistently delighted me whenever they were on screen, whether they were by themselves or with others. Roy Mustang, the leader, is probably my favorite character in the show, as the writers and actors make great use of his stoic nature  throughout the show, you slowly start to realize his motives, and its done in such an interesting way that you cant help but want to see him succeed. Then theres Maes Hughes, Mustangs closest ally who is not only hilarious, but also a good friend to our leads later in the show  hes the most normal character (hes a family guy who tries to be reasonable), but thats not a bad thing. Theres also Riza Hawkeye, Mustangs first lieutenant, a no-nonsense lady who constantly reminds the audience that shes cool. Next would be Alex Louis Armstrong, who comes from the proud Armstrong lineage (as he constantly reminds us)  this character is a bulking man of muscle with a heart of gold, but that doesnt make him any less enjoyable, especially as he also has to make tough choices and do what he doesnt want to do throughout the show. In addition to these four, there are about six others that are great as well. Aside from the military, there are other great characters, too, including interesting villains, Winry Rockbell (a childhood friend of the brothers and an excellent mechanic) and Scar, who is easily one of the best characters of the show, as he seems to always be making trouble for our heroes and yet, I root for him anyways (a great example of an antihero, he is). So, as the title states, this show works because it is character-driven, and since that it my favorite type of story, I loved it. However, plot is important, too.

 As a whole, the plot is great. The story is engaging throughout the entire show and makes you want to avoid doing work so that you can just find out what is going to happen next episode. One of the most interesting aspects of the show, thats also great part of Avatar, is the world itself. The show almost never just stops to explain the world, but rather just incorporates what we need to know in the story  its very well-integrated. As for the maturity-level of the show, it deals with some pretty heavy stuff, including torture and death  I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that early in the show, there is a really dark ending to an episode that made me have to stop watching for a little because I had to really think about what had just transpired. But, seeing as how this is a review, I have to mention that the plot isn't perfect. It can be very confusing at times (possibly because this adaptation of the manga is very different from the source material and the anime writers had to come up with new material on their own), especially towards the ending, where way too much material is jam-packed into the last few episodes. I don't think that I necessarily disliked the ending, I just didn't have enough time to process it as it was being revealed to me, so I ended up feeling very conflicted; this is a shame because the show starts off slowly and allows stuff to develop naturally, but the ending seemed to do the opposite. Still, as I already said, this is a show about the characters and it is because of the wonderful characters that I care so much about what happens to them at the end  whether or not you end up liking the ending, I think that most would agree that its about the journey, not the destination for this show.

 Two points that I want to quickly address about the show are the animation and music; both are spectacular. I cant compare this to other anime that were released in 2003, but just based on my upbringing of American cartoons, this show is beautiful  not only with its art direction, but also the animation itself, including some nice fight choreography. Its probably not the best animation that was out there during its run, but it impressed me enough. As for the music, thats also great, both with the BGM and openings/endings. My personal favorite opening was Undo, by Cool Joke, which was always a great start to the show; my favorite BGM track (although it is the only one I know by name, admittedly) is Brothers, which has different variations, but always seems to make me like a scene more. Fun Fact: Vic Mignogna sings a beautiful English version of the song  after hearing it, I knew that I had to watch the series it was based on, so thats how I was introduced to this show. So, yeah, great music and animation.

 Before I conclude this review, I want to mention the movie that was released in 2005, after the series conclusion  Conqueror of Shamballa. The movie is just under two hours long and although its not amazing, it does help to conclude the series and I would certainly recommend you watch it if you finished the series  its essentially the true ending. In addition to that, the movie obviously has a bigger budget, so the animation improves significantly, and the opening set piece of the film is one of the most fun out of the entire series. Definitely worth a watch

Fullmetal Alchemist is one of the best TV shows that I have ever seen. It may be a show that revolves around a couple kids, but it is one of the most mature, well-written (especially for the characters) shows that I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Its not perfect (I got a little sick of them mention equivalent exchange over and over again), but no show is. If you were ever considering watching an anime, but couldn't find one to get you started, pick this one  Im glad I did. Its entertaining, its thought-provoking, its gorgeous, and it made me sad to realize its over. Go forth and experience this majestic journey of the Elric brothers for yourself and when its over, youll feel like you're saying goodbye to old friends  then watch Brotherhood after, because that is supposed to be good, too.",1517616000,,8809,4.505956112852664
