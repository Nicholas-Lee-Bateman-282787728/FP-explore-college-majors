2398489,5,B000AYQJ4C,"Just when you think their last performance was their best, the Dundalk clan have outdone themselves with this CONCERT & DOCUMENTARY!!

I've always thought as entertaining they are, they've seemed to be a bit stiff, but they were WONDERFUL in Geneva and really have come into their own onstage .. .. Maturity perhaps .. ..

The exquisite documentary, early footage and EXTENSIVE background on their personal/family lives is unrivaled and you will never venture as deep into their lives as you will with this DVD!

And, shockingly, the word 'retirement' has now popped up about the Corrs and with everyone married (except Andrea, I think), this great ride now has an end in sight .. .. We best appreciate them now and pray they make one last tour of the States!!

BUY THE DVD NOW -- If you don't love this DVD .. .. well .. .. 'you never loved them anyways' .. ..",1137801600,3,861,4.571428571428571
2398490,4,B000AYQJ4C,"Well, so I'm a bit fan of this outstanding band, never the less, as a costumer what I look forward when buying a DVD its quality and having a good time with whatever i chose to buy. Right? ... Well mates, thats just what you'll get if you buy this. Jim, Sharon, Caroline, Andy, Anto and Keith are back ... plus two new guys; Jason and Keiran, they manage to give the live performance of a life time, they do, maybe not quite energetic as ""lansdowne road"" but hell of improvement from that awful show in the ""live in London"" DVD, if you ask me ... the concert's quite short, maybe a couple more songs, Even If, maybe Baby Be Brave would have been nice, actually the menu has it as background song, whatever, its a beautiful show, filled with new stuff like a couples of nice solos, lot of tabs changed in the songs, a kind of rockish feeling to the same old pop hit singles, a energy of the public that you can just feel trough the screen of your TV, the Irish feeling mixed with their new more mature vibe ... and what bout those new songs! They just sound so much freaking better live!, I'm telling you ""...Who lost the keys of your car??"" in the opening song ""Humdrum"", Andrea's voice ... well actually, everything sounds amazing, about the picture/image quality, mates, I can assure you that Stylorouge guys are gods, no kidding, it has such a great quality and angles, and a couple of b/w shots ... just amazing.

About the ""All the way home"" DVD ... its just what every fan needs, for real, the footage its amazing, the whole story behind each CD, behind some of the songs, gigs and photo shoots its told by the same people who lived it, no more ""curious facts"" in  a Fan-site ... here's all the truth, sometimes really sweet, sometimes rather bitter, you've got it all ... a great deal. It has been quite a long journey for this guys and sometimes, we, as fans, don't get to be part of it ... but with this DVD, all that's behind, we get to see the facts, weddings, laughs, tears, pains and fears of this Irish Band ... not quite a lot of DVD can get you to the point where this takes you, seriously, worth to have it!

Hope this reviews was helpful ....  Thx ... xo",1134950400,19,2172,4.2773722627737225
2398511,1,B000AYQJ4C,"This is actually my first 'non-review' here on Amazon.com. The one-star rating has to do with the fact that when I received this DVD in the mail, it was NOT in the North American Region 1 format but the European PAL format which is incompatible on DVD players in the U.S.

I'll admit that I am pretty biased when it comes to The Corrs music. I'm a big fan of theirs and many other Irish bands. When I discovered that the U.S. release of this DVD was not going to include the ""All The Way Home"" documentary (the reason why I wanted the DVD in the first place), I rushed at the opportunity to grab the import. I found it to be personally special that the DVD showed up in my mailbox on St. Patrick's Day. Well, the excitement turned to utter disgust when I placed the DVD in my player and it wouldn't play!!! It was only then that I discovered the PAL region symbol on the back cover.

Apparently, after reading the other reviews and 'non-reviews' on this product, I am not the only victim of this happening. This is a shame because 99% of the time, Amazon is on the ball with accuracy on what they sell.

Unfortunately, I am unable to submit a genuine review on what looks like another excellent addition to ones Corrs collection. Until I receive this in a playable format, I will repeat what others have stated here: Be on the lookout and be prepared!!! If you order this DVD, you may or may not receive one that's compatible with your DVD equipment. It looks like some have been fortunate and received a genuine Region 1 version. So, they ARE out there. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those customers.....yet.

Hopefully soon though. When I do, I will delete this 'non-review' and replace it with a real one.",1142640000,5,1708,4.412698412698413
2398512,5,B000AYQJ4C,"I just finished watching Live in Geneva and once again I watched another great concert from the greatest band in the world. Definitely worth getting. I had the privilege of seeing the Corrs once for a 10-song concert years ago. I sure hope they get back to the states, particularly Tampa, FL, before they call it quits. You can't go wrong with anything done by them.",1141257600,4,366,4.5606060606060606
2398513,3,B000AYQJ4C,"Before I start my review let me just say 2 things. First, I would really like to thank C. Hsieh for his/her great review. Great insight into a great band. If you haven't already read it go there now, go ahead, I'll wait... And second, for all our sakes,  I really hope this isn't the last live venture for the Corrs. That would be too great a loss for a musical world full of posers and samplers. Let's all keep our fingers crossed that they can find a way to manage their individual family lives (which everybody deserves, God bless and good luck to all the family members) with this extraordinary musical experience called The Corrs.

And really that's what the Corrs are all about. The experience. The music is great whether you are listening to them on the radio, CD, or seeing them live, but the main thing you take away from this group is the experience. One of the truly great talents that are actually better live than in the studio. I consider myself very lucky to have seen them in the states on their last tour. Fabulous EXPERIENCE.

OK, now for the DVD, and thanks for indulging me if you've read this far. I again agree with C. Hsieh, that of all their live DVD's this is not the best one. But it is the only one featuring songs off the Borrowed Heaven album, which I love, so in any case it is worth the price. Yes the show seems a bit rushed, the quality a bit muddy, the costumes maybe not what we are used to, but they still look great. Hey, these are 3 VERY beautiful women no matter what they do. Oh, and Jim ... you are nice looking too. Nuff of that...

Now, be warned that this is a region 2,3,4,5 disk. It says so right on the box. Some computers will let you view it, but IT'S NOT GONNA WORK ON MACHINES BOUGHT IN THE US. Unless you buy one that is multi-regional. Philips makes one, and for the additional $59.99 it cost me, it was worth it. Because with all it's flaws, and there are several, this disk was worth the extra cost. From what I understand the LIve In Geneva disk will be released here in the states, without the documentary. I guess they felt that U.S. fans don't care enough about the group to merit the second disk. NOT TRUE marketing machine. They have many fans in the U.S. as well.

Lastly, if you ARE new to the group, buy the other DVD's first. Start with Live at the Royal Albert Hall, then get the Unplugged DVD, Live at Lansdowne Rd, Live in London, Best of Videos, and whatever else you can find. See it as it progressed. Watch them grow, and blossom into one of the finest bands in the world. It'll be fun, and you'll thank me for the suggestion. No, really, you will, seriously, now off you go...

Quick note to the Corrs, if any of you ever read this (Hey, it's possible... I wrote a review of another band's new album and the lead singer sent me an email) please don't leave us all alone way over here in the states. We will miss you too much.  Please come see us again, we love you guys too...

OK, so in the end, not a GREAT disk, but a really good one... so give it a shot. Serious Corrs fans can add a star, go ahead, I won't mind...",1140739200,5,3091,4.200674536256324
2398514,5,B000AYQJ4C,"Having only been able to view the ""History"" (the concert disk being defective, waiting replacement shipping), I very much enjoyed the longview of their success.  I had a crash course in this regional coding fiasco but found that the computer's DVD player/CD writable drives can have the region play setting changed (but this switching can only be done 4 more times after it's initial setting (which is another scam...)).  Having to play it via computer rather than a home entertainment setup is frustrating but the product is an excellent time capsule of the group.",1140652800,,565,5.0
2398515,3,B000AYQJ4C,"The Release:

The Region 1 NTSC format of the 2-disc ""All the Way Home"" was originally scheduled to be released in the US on December 6, 2005. After being postponed a couple of times, it appears that the release will not happen after all. Instead, the single-disc ""Live in Geneva"" (without the documentary) has been released. The following review is based on the Region 2-6 PAL version of the 2-disc ""All the Way Home"" DVD set.

The Music:

The music of the Corrs have several characteristics. In addition to its Irish Celtic roots, their songs are written in clever and sophisticated musical structures, often accompanied by background vocal harmony in canon or polyphonic form.

""Dreams"", their first hit in the UK and a re-arrangement of a Fleetwood Mac original song, is a fine example of all these characteristics. In addition to the clever arrangement of Fleetwood Mac's original, Sharon's violin breaks in the middle of the song with a typical Celtic melody, a brief three-part vocal polyphonic as sung by Andrea, Sharon and Carolina was introduced later. Numerous revisions to a song is another Corrs' distinct characteristics. Through the years ""Dreams"" has had many revisions. The earliest version of ""Dreams,"" as sung in Amsterdam Melkweg in November 1977, made little change to the Fleetwood Mac original song. The latest version is included in their ""Borrowed Heaven Tour"" (2004), and features an extensive guitar prelude to the song (as you see in ""Live in Geneva"" here).

""Breathless"" is the hit that has won the Corrs great fame worldwide. It is worth mentioning that a sophisticated polyphonic background chorus is introduced at the tail end of the song.

An Irish composer, Bill Whelan, said the Corrs have ""musical depth"". This musical depth comes from their basic training in classical music. When the Corrs were working on their first album at a studio in Malibu, California, it was not unusual to see one of the Corrs sitting in front of a piano and playing Chopin's Nocturnes during a recording session break.

A background vocal chorus is one of the important characteristics of the Corrs' songs. This presents a major issue when it comes to the audio mixing. It becomes controversial if the background vocals are not given proper emphasis in the final product. Some of the Corrs' earlier songs were re-mixed and re-issued because of the controversy.

The DVD ""Best of the Corrs, the Videos"" gives a rare opportunity to compare the drastically different audio mixings of the same song, ""All the love in the world"". One is the earlier version that didn't place any emphasis on the vocal background. Another does not just emphasize the vocals, but it features the absolutely beautiful vocal harmonies in acappella form at the very beginning of the song.

Video editing should also show proper screen clips of the background vocalists when they sing. Sharon is not just the violin player in the group, but she is also the key singer of the background vocals.

The Documentary:

The original release plan was just the ""Live in Geneva"", the second last gig in the ""Borrowed Heaven Tour"". To make the release more attractive, a decision was made in July of 2005 to add a long-form sell-through documentary - ""All the Way Home"". It turned out that the documentary itself became the major selling point of this 2-disc DVD release. The documentary depicts both candidly and vividly how the Corrs rose from amateur status to stardom. Obviously, tremendous musical talent is not the only thing required; aggressive management (in this case, John Huges), capable producers (in this case, Mitchell Froom and Mutt Lange in particular) and lots of good luck are also major factors that make a band commercially successful.

The magnitude of success that the Corrs has achieved in the United States is much less than what they achieved in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. For example, the Corrs' hottest hit ""Breathless"" was only the top 30 hit on Billboard as compared to the #1 hit on the chart in 18 other countries. It will be an interesting case study topic in the pop music industry to find out why this happened.

If there is anything bad in this documentary, it must be the inclusion of the clip that shows the Corrs' visit to the United States aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy. It not only negates their ""Merry Christmas, War is over"" performance in front of President Clinton and any of their performances in many charity gigs, but it also sends out the wrong political message to millions of their fans around the world.

The Gig:

It seems everything went wrong in ""Live in Geneva"". The whole gig seems to be muddy and rushed through from beginning to end. The muddy and rushed feeling probably was bought on by the intensity of the new drummer, Jason Duffy, who replaces Caroline on the tour. As a specific and drastic comparison, Caroline had a much better and delicate handling of the drums as compared to what Jason did at the tail end of ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"".  Another extra new guy, Kieran Kiely, may have also contributed to the muddy effect of the sound by playing some instruments (accordion) that are supposed to augment the overall sound on the stage. On the other hand, the stage lighting is dark and spotty. In addition, the new songs in the Borrowed Heaven album lack the spark of that the older songs and this is also reflected on the chart positions.

The appearance of the group also has become a critical point. Sharon changes herself from a brunette to a blonde; obviously she didn't know of a recent survey conducted by Beautiko (a British beauty products manufacturer) of 3000 men and women concluding that ""brunettes are more beautiful than blondes"". There is also criticism of the short skirt, long boots and wide belt of ""Ireland's most beautiful woman"", Andrea Corr. (Andrea wore a similar outfit even in the sub-zero temperatures of an open-air concert in the Austrian ski resort town Ischgl, the last gig in the ""Borrowed Heaven Tour"").

Worst of all is that in this DVD release, the audio mixing does not meet the expectations, even when the video editing is generally ok. The Corrs has been, unfortunately, in decline for a while now. The ""Borrowed Heaven Tour"" was not as extensive as the ""In Blue Tour"" in 2000. It is known that some of the larger venues in the ""Borrow Heaven Tour"" were not sold out and a number of shows in North America were cancelled. The chart position of the ""Borrowed Heaven"" album only seems to confirm this, and the release of the ""Live in Geneva"" DVD does not help the situation either.

If you are new to the Corrs, ""Live in Geneva"" is definitely not the choice for a good introduction. The top choice is ""The Corrs - Unplugged"" for its superior audio mixing and video editing. If you insist on having a big concert atmosphere, then ""Live in London"" is the only choice. Of course nothing can beat the ""The Best of Corrs: The Video"" for its studio audio recording and mixing, plus the meticulously planned video shooting sequence and editing. Both ""Live at Royal Albert Hall"" and ""Live at Lansdowne Road"", along with the ""Live in Geneva"" DVD reviewed here, are historical values reserved for the true hard-""Corr"" fans.

The Future:

In the ""All the Way Home"" documentary, John Huges says: ""nothing scares managers as much as boyfriends - except HUSBANDS!"" and ""If there's one thing a manager gets scared about, it's husbands. But if he really gets paranoid, it's CHILDREN!"". Well, Caroline got married in 2002 and delivered her second baby before the Borrowed Heaven Tour ended in 2004. Sharon got married in 2001 and is expecting her first baby in the spring this year (2006). Jim has just announced his engagement and his fiancee is expecting a baby this year too. Andrea is the only person of the group who is still free and single, but she has started a movie career on the side, and she has already starred in two big screen movies, ""The Boys and Girls from County Clare"" in 2004 and ""The Bridge"" in 2005.

In Europe, the Corrs as a group still appear on TV show here and there last year in Europe. They also came out with a new album ""Home"" last year that was dedicated to traditional Irish songs. But the future of the Corrs is still in question, as Andrea said in the documentary that ""Is this (Borrowed Heaven Tour) the farewell tour? Maybe our last, I don't know."" Jim said ""All the good things have to come to an end, and it could possibly be the right time to get out.""  As a matter of fact, back in 1998 when Sharon was 28 year old, she said ""You know, this is not something that lasts forever. So I think it's relationships and children, and I really think that's what it comes down to for everyone, and it's no different for us, we are just doing something else in the meantime.""

At the peak of the Corrs' career in 2000, Paul McGuinness, the Manager of U2, said ""that kind of pop music and song writing can bring the Corrs a very long career."" Long career or not, the Corrs' ""Breathless"", ""Dreams"", ""Only When I Sleep"", ... will always be long alive in the hearts of a million hard-""Corr"" fans. To them, the Corrs are FOREVER!",1139788800,9,9128,4.737240075614367
2398516,5,B000AYQJ4C,"Okay, it's 8 March 2006 and time to update my review since my DVD set of ""All the Way Home"" finally arrived via US Mail!  The set I received is indeed Region 1 and is in NTSC format.  From reading the other reviews, it looks as if Amazon may be shipping out Region 1 NTSC to some people and Region 2-6 PAL format DVDs to other people.  It just pure luck that I received the correct region/format, I assume.  Amazon needs to look at their stock of ""All the Way Home"" DVD sets they have and separate out the two formats!  In any event, if you end up with the wrong region, then see my notes below regarding the Philips DVP642 DVD player....

Another faux pas on Amazon's part that I found amusing is they sent me an e-mail that said ""We've noticed that customers who have purchased All the Way Home: A History of the Corrs (Plus Live in Geneva) also purchased The Corrs: Live in Geneva on DVD.""  Huh?  Why in the world would someone who purchased ""All the Way Home: A History of the Corrs (Plus Live in Geneva)"" also purchase ""Live in Geneva"" when All the Way Home comes with ""Live in Geneva""??????  DOH!!!

Anyway, as far as the DVD set is concerned, this is a documentary DVD which happens to include the concert, that is, it's not a concert DVD that includes the documentary.  That said, the primary reason I bought this set if for the documentary and I must say it is a great documentary of a GREAT and VERY talented family band.  Anyone who is a TRUE fan of The Corrs should have this documentary.

Now, the second disc of the concert ""Live in Geneva""...  I was disappointed with the concert.  It starts off with ""Baby Be Brave"" and then suddenly cuts to ""Humdrum""...well, I would much rather see ""Baby Be Brave"" performed than ""Humdrum""!  Especially since the music was playing and I expected it!  It was just bad editing.

The concert, lacked audience participation, at least at the beginning.  The concert gets better, probably around their presentation of ""Runaway"" halfway through.  The concert picks up then.

The one thing that absolutely killed me about the concert is the accordion playing during ""No Frontiers.""  It just ruined the song, and it ruined it so bad I had to grab the remote and skip to the next song on the DVD!  I don't know whose idea it was to bring a squeeze box into the mix, but it was a bad idea.

I guess I expected more from this concert having previously bought and thoroughly enjoyed their other concert DVDs (but at least this one didn't have nearly as many as those stupid black & white shots someone insists upon inserting into the concerts).

Overall, Live in Geneva just lacked the ""party"" atmosphere of their previous concerts.  If you just want a complete collection of their DVDs, then, yes, you want a copy of Live in Geneva, but if you aren't that big of a fan yet still enjoy their music, then I recommend getting the DVD of ""Live at Lansdowne Road"" which totally rocks!  ""Live in London"" is also great, just not as great as Lansdowne Road.  If you don't care about the live stadium concerts and you just want to see them do a smaller performance where you can be bowled over by the ethereal sounds of Andrea's voice and her siblings' music/vocals combined with a background orchestra, then spend your money on their ""MTV Unplugged"" DVD, it is simply outstanding.

What did I like about the concert?  Well, Andrea's skirt and boots were HOT, but pretty much anything she wears looks good to me!  Other than my male-centric opinion of Andrea Corr, this concert includes both ""Angel"" and ""Goodbye"" from the ""Borrowed Heaven"" CD.  These songs relate to the passing away of Jean Corr, their mother.  Having had a relative pass away recently, I, personally, can relate to those songs, especially ""Goodbye"" and I do appreciate their inclusion in the concert.

Original post from 12 February 2006:

DVD Regions and PAL format

Several people have complained about the DVD set not being Region 1 and NTSC.  This is a legitimate complaint since the description clearly says ""Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only....""; however, there is a workaround for this:  get the Phillips DVP642 DVD player available from Amazon for $59.49 or from Wal-Mart for $57.36 (at least that is the shelf price in Alabama).  The player is capable of playing both NTSC and PAL formats from ANY region, but you have to set it to ""region free mode"" which is EASILY done via the remote (open the tray, press  7 8 9 OK 0  on the remote).  Please note there is rumor that the newest firmware on this model disallows changing to region free mode, though, but I have not confirmed that.  In addition to playing DVDs, this player will also play AVI files burn to blank CD or DVD that you would normally only be able to play on your computer!

Okay, I didn't want to turn this into a product review for a DVD player, I just thought you guys would like to know there is a way to play this DVD set.  And it's true you should not have to go to the expense of getting another player, but consider this:  you may not want the North American release of this DVD.  The release date for the North American release is currently March 14th, but it may very well be a single disc ONLY containing the concert in Geneva and not the documentary.  From what I have read on-line, and I quote:  ""there are rumours about a special 'Live In Geneva' DVD being released in the US without the documentary and other goodies.""  That is, it may very well be only ""Live in Geneva"" without ""All the Way Home: A History of the Corrs""!  Personally, as a true fan of The Corrs, I want the documentary DVD, not just the concert, so I am ordering the non-North American version!",1139702400,5,5683,4.506353861192571
2398517,1,B000AYQJ4C,"The Corrs DVD set I received was marked ""Import.""  Do I care?  Well now I sure do because the two DVDs in the set will not play on my Toshiba DVD player and also will not play on my Dell laptop DVD player.  The DVD set box says ""Region codes: 2,3,4,5.""  What is missing is the United States region code 1.  Somehow I don't think it's proper for Amazon to sell incompatible DVDs to U.S. customers.  In order to share my disappointment with Amazon I'm sending the DVDs back for a refund and will reorder this great DVD set when Amazon offers a U.S. version.  I also ordered The Corrs Home CD with the All The Way Home DVD set.  The CD arrived with a broken plastic case even though it was properly outside boxed by Amazon.  I'm keeping the CD because it will play on my laptop.

If you live in region 2,3,4 or 5 and love the Corrs then you will really like this DVD set which shows you the history of how the Corrs gained success.  If you live in the U.S. avoid this ""Import"" DVD set.",1139184000,11,982,4.11578947368421

8080983,4,B000AYQJ4C,"I was also worried about the region code problem. And the Corrs official website said the documentary was not available in the US, only the concert DVD. But I received Region Code 1 for US for both DVDs, so that was a relief.

The documentary should be of interest to all Corrs fans. It was not a terribly in-depth or powerful documentary, but still worth your time for the 90 minute look at their rise to the top.

The concert DVD is great for long-time fans. However, for those new to the Corrs I would highly recommend that first you buy Lansdowne Road (1999) and Live in London (2000) for the best big concert experience. Those performances are were energetic and magical from the peak years of this group. Geneva is a slight step down from those performances, particulary with Caroline being replaced on drums. Luckily she was at this performance, unlike most of the tour, and sat in on secondary percussion and harmony vocals.

The new songs are a nice change, particulary Summer Sunshine and Long Night. But otherwise, they seem to be playing most of the same set from 5 years earlier. Obviously they will always play Dreams, So Young, Breathless, What Can I Do, Runaway, Toss the Feathers, Queen of Hollywood as the core corrs songs. But it would be nice to see new covers to show off their musicality instead of No Frontiers and Old Town for 6 years now.

Documentary and extras make it worth while. Plus, it was probably their final big tour.

Get the old stuff first and you will be hooked. My must-see rankings:

1- Lansdowne Road 1999
2- Unplugged 1999
3- Live in London 2000
4- Geneva 2004
5- Royal Albert Hall 1998",1147910400,6,1629,4.561643835616438

This is definitely 1 INCREDIBLE DVD Set. Andrea, Caroline, Sharon & Jim are just GREAT! The Corrs are my 2nd favorite group of ALL-TIME!!! Hopefully everyone that orders this AWESOME package from now on will get the right Region Code. Long live The Corrs (especially Andrea, she's so BEAUTIFUL!!!)",1146614400,,505,4.622222222222222
8080985,5,B000AYQJ4C,"I'll repeat the praise for the DVD set, but I'd really like to let everyone know that I ordered this set last week (April of 2006) and I was concerned that I'd get a European coded set as others are complaining about. I received a *Region 1 USA* coded set and it plays nicely in my DVD player. So, if you want one, order it, then send a message to the seller reinforcing your interest in Region 1 as advertised (it worked for me).",1146441600,,430,4.130952380952381

The documentary half of this DVD set is almost everything I could have wanted in a life story of one of my favorite bands. Plenty of great interviews, in depth informative history on how they became what they are, some great rare footage including home videos and their first ever gig. Perhaps the only thing that dissapointed me was I would have preferred a bit less interuption of the musical material. At one stage they are about to play forgiven not forgotten in an effort to get a record deal only to get cut off 15 seconds in by talking and then a new section. However small beefs aside this DVD gives you plenty of everything and alot of insight into the struggles and hard work the Corrs have put in to make it where they are, and compared to the duration of some documentaries we have been treated quited well.

THE CORRS LIVE IN GENEVA

Perhaps the most exciting factor of The Corrs ""Live in Geneva"", is that this is the first time I have noticed a 'large' change from one DVD to the next. Though there were differences in the first few concert Dvds, alot of the tracks seemed to be the same thing over again more or less (Don't get me wrong, the same thing they were doing was fantastic). Right from the word go the firts song which for so long has been ""Only when I sleep"" has been changed... in my opinion a change which shouldn't have taken place but a change none the less. Also for the first time the Corrs have enough albums released that there has to be quite a few fan favorite songs left out in order to keep the concert under 3 or 4 hours.

A big plus which I have been waiting for, for a long time, is the addition of a couple of guitar solos, and extended instrumentals and songs such as: What Can I do. A positive move by the Corrs.

I love the Corrs and Andrea (lead singer) to bits however I wish Andrea would stop yelling non - stop throughout 90% of the instrument breaks, and just tone it down a little, its only when she has the tuin whistle in her mouth you get a great extended and uninterupted intrumental break.

Sound: The DTS sound is great, however definantly not perfect when you compare it to other dvd's, and I don't really see any excuse for it, in this day and age a modern concert should be almost perfect. The clarity and mixing is mostly great except the dynamics and energy seems to be lost in parts of some songs with poor mixing. 'Toss the feathers' is as unexciting as I have heard it. Overall definantly good enough sound to get the feel though.

Video: The video quality is fine, gives you alot of shots of all the musicians, the only thing a little bit lacking is shots of the crowd, however this didn't worry me at all.

Set List:Again with the new albums they don't have enough time to fit in all their great songs, I am glad they still have plenty of the great old stuff whilst including the 'better' of the 'borrowed heaven' album. 'Summer Sunshine' and 'Long night' fit in really well to their sets, a couple less well.

Performance: I really enjoyed their performance, as I mentioned it was a change to their previous performances, the extended solos, I thought 'radio' was the best I have ever heard it and they still seem to be having fun after all this time, I guess it is really hard when you are comparing ever performance to 'Lansdowne Road' which I think just cannot be topped. For what it was I thought it was great. I think minus the Accordian in no frontiers would have worked for me.

Overall: To some it up when it comes down to it if you are a fan of the Corrs you will love it, if you are new to the COrrs you will love it. It is easy to pick on a few minor flaws but its still great.",1143072000,14,3686,4.260371959942775
8080987,5,B000AYQJ4C,"As a true fan of the corrs, since 1997, I can say this DVD set is a must-have product for every fan. The documentary ""all the way home"" shows all the ups and downs of the band throughout their career and the efforts they have to make after the release of every album. For those who imagined that the corrs life is all about glamour and success will find out, in this documentary, that there are many challenges on pop music and luckly they managed to overcome them, becoming one of the most successfull bands all over the world. The documentary, divided in acts, shows the corrs since the very beginning of their dream, playing pop songs on Jim's home studio. Then, we see the band playing in Dublin pubs, persuing their dream. After joining the cast of ""The Commitments"", where they met their manager John Huges, the Corrs signed with Atlantic Records and started their career. It's very surprising to learn that ""Talk on Corners"", their second album, once the best selling album in UK, was not an immediate hit and demanded a lot of promotion to get on charts.

The DVD extras are cool, showing the band singing for the Pope, in a navy boat and in an embarassing situation, where they had to sing the US Star spangled banner in a football game and mics did not work. Poor corrs!

The second DVD, with Live in Geneva concert, is great, with the Corrs hits and new music from ""Borrowed Heaven"" CD. It's live music, played by a very talented band, with a touch of magic, as always. I love this concert, with the comeback of Caroline, who was not following the band through the tour, in 2004, due to her pregnancy of a second child.

The question that remains unanswered, after you watch the DVDs: Will the Corrs continue as a band? How much effort are they supposed to make, sacrificing their personal lives, to follow with this dream? We know that ""Home"" album, the last one released by the corrs, with irish covers of traditional music, represents the end of a full circle on their career. But is it all over? I hope not, because the Corrs have much more to offer to the world and we are looking forward to listen to a new album, with great pop songs, tours and promotions all over the globe, especially in South America, where we have been waiting for them for ages.

Don't think twice and bring home this DVD set, with the history of the corrs and a great concert, which may be their farewell tour, as they've stated.",1142726400,4,2420,4.468325791855204
