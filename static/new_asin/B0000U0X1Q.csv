1946167,4,B0000U0X1Q,"Well, it isn't brilliantly original, but SO CLOSE does establish and maintain a strong story line complete with a few unexpected twists, and adds more than gratuitous fight scenes.  All three actresses play their parts very well, and all three main characters are well-drawn and captivating.  The attraction lies in the slick technology and fight scenes.  Also, the erotic possibility in having three strong, capable women working closely and fighting together is, if not fulfilled, at least hinted at more strongly than in Charlie's Angels.  It was slicker, had better technology, better acting, better costumes, and much better plot than Charlie's Angels.  Then there's the kiss.  A must have.",1076976000,4,695,5.330275229357798

1946169,5,B0000U0X1Q,"Forget Charlie's Angels- trailor trash compared to Qi Shu, Vicki Zhao and Karen Mok. From the opening high tech sequences through to Vicki's departure, this is one of the most extraordinarily erotic and dynamically energized action films you will ever see. Qi and Vicki play sisters who witnessed their parents' murder, then co-opt their father's surveillance invention to become professional killers. It is smarter than the Matrix, more ingenious than Minority Report, more enthusiastically acted than anything else since CROUCHING TIGER. This is a great, and maybe the greatest Hong Kong action film ever.
Qi Shu oozes sexuality. She enters a scene and you can't take your eyes off of her or even think about anything but her graceful and seductive demeanour. The Buddha would not approve. Vicki Zhao is sultry, somehwat more innocent and projects just enough curiosity about her orientation to convincingly confuse Karen Mok, the detective out to catch the sisters. There is something subliminally enticing about the way Qi and Vicki play out big sister/little sister rivalry. When Qi falls for a guy,  Vicki takes an interest in Karen Mok. There is a subtext of lesbian attraction even among Qi and Karen as they engage in a sword fight that causes some modest exposure, very definitely attracting Vicki's gaze. The men are all either stuffed misogynist suits, or completely stupid droids, and the suits are bad all the way through. The action sequences are dazzling, the cinematography clever without being obvious, and the ballet of the encounters exquisitely choreographed. The final sword fight is as brilliantly executed as anything in CROUCHING TIGER or ROB ROY. You will definitely stand and applaud. When Vicki kisses Karen at the end, Karen's confusion surfaces and as Vicki walks away, you find yourself hoping that the writers will find a plausible way to construct a convincing sequel.
There is a lot of violence to this, but that seems to wash over you. The heat comes from the women, who are just incendiary.",1075334400,,2026,5.102409638554217
1946170,4,B0000U0X1Q,"First you need to forive a couple of things before you can truely enjoy this movie, like the thin plot and the pluasibility of the characters, other than that, this movie is pretty good, for obvious reasons- the well-cheographed fight scenes and it's a fresh change having chicks  do the fighting.
Shu Qi gets top billing and yes, she's gorgeous, but I think you'll be more impress with Karen Mok.  She might not have the lucscious lips or the obvious sex appeal, but she has an edgy, gritty physical presence which is important if you're gonna be an action movie star ( maybe she already is, this is the first time I've seen her in a movie).  You can believe it when she's punching, kicking and flying thru the air because physically she is convincing.  Unlike Shu Qi, who seem a tad bit fragile and she looked like she was hung on a wire a lot for the more demanding fight sequence.  I also like Vicky Zhao.  She's terrific as the younger, less competent sister and the heavy acting was all left to her. The handcuffed fight scene with Qi and Mok is something to marvel at and will undoubtedly be copied. The clean high tech cinematography is hard to ignore.  It is a study in geometry, angles and physics, specially with the flying bullets and glass everywhere.  This is well illustrated in the last shot out by the stairway.
There's a lot to be admired in this movie like the many imaginative ways of shooting a gun; upside down, downside up,sidedays, by ways, falling down, twisting and the overall imagination of the filmakers. As a Hong Kong, over-the-top action flick--- It delivers!  Just don't think too much when you're watching this movie.  Concentrate more on the gun fights, sword fights and kung fu fights.  I did find a few things annoying though. For example, the Mok and Zhao characters- were they suppose to be attracted to each other, and what was that kiss about?  they could have at least done it right and gone for a full on lip lock titaliting threatment it deserved, outherwise why bother throwing in this little sublot at the end.  Also a couple of the fight scenes were so techinical and crisp that you feel like picking up your supernintendo control pad and playing along.  Ultimately I give this movie a generous rating because it doesn't fail to deliver its promise- ACTION and lots of it.  The DVD doesn't have any extras but be thankful it offers a lot of language and subtitle options for some of us that wish to see the movie in its original sound.  If you're not too uptight and don't sweat the little details, you'll enjoy this movie.",1073001600,35,2570,4.5664488017429194
1946171,4,B0000U0X1Q,"I'm not one for long reviews but if your a fan of Hong Kong action you will love ""So Close""! Fantastic ""Gun Fu"" and Hand to Hand Combat! There's some pretty serious drama too,But the showdown finale is one of the best that I've ever seen!! I hope Cory Yuen makes ""Transporter 2"" and incorporates some of the things I've seen in this film. This should be in your collection if you really appreciate the art.",1073001600,,406,4.355263157894737
1946172,5,B0000U0X1Q,"ok, lets face the fact that they get some scope from the movie ""Charlie's Angels"", but these asian females really did good in this movie, but this movie is much more interesting than Charlie's Angels. I watched the movie once. It has a great story and it will make you realized that asian people can also compete internationally.",1070323200,2,329,4.689655172413793
1946173,4,B0000U0X1Q,"This film, about two high-tech female assassins-for-hire chased by a female police detective, is imperfect, often implausible and predictable; but it still thrilled me anyway. It has three very positive things going for it:
1. Terrific fight choreography by Corey Yuen, one of the greatest fight choreographers around (he worked on ""X-Men"" and ""Lethal Weapon 4"", many Hong Kong films.) The kung fu is great, although the gunfights are standard issue.
2. Hsu Qi, who is one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere, gets a lot of face time and sexy outfits. Unfortunately she is not a great actress, but hey, nobody's perfect.
3. Karen Mok, who IS a great actress and extraordinarily charismatic, though not nearly as pretty.
Drawbacks:
1. The story is standard issue and predictable.
2. Opening action sequence is very implausible; later fights are improvements.
3. The third heroine, Wei (Vicky) Zhao, is way too soft-looking to be a believable fighter. She is a bad actress and unfortunately gets some super-emotional scenes that are cringeworthy.
Now about Karen Mok. I'd never seen Mok in anything before, but as the police detective she was muscular, charismatic, just amazing. Considering how many fights there are here, it's crucial that the women be believably trying to hurt somebody. We want THROWDOWN! In the fights, you definitely believe Mok is trying to hurt somebody. As the story progresses,  Mok's character becomes only more masculine/adrogynous. Which is a good thing.
Only once or twice can you believe Hsu Qi is trying to hurt somebody. But she looks gorgeous in a black cocktail dress, so we'll forgive her, and she's photographed well, which is important. (The face time she gets here makes up for how badly she was wasted in ""The Transporter."")
What really made me want this on DVD, is the terrific girl-on-girl fight between Mok and Hsu Qi, which happens midway through the film. They ride an elevator together, and each knows the other is her enemy, but they pretend not to know. Outside the elevator they get into a fight so classic, so good that action directors should study it for years into the future. Finally, Hsu Qi gets down and dirty in her black cocktail dress; you can really believe she wants to hurt somebody. Yeah! THROWDOWN! THROWDOWN!! And Mok, who's dressed like a boy, gives it right back to her. Director Corey Yuen pulls out all the stops here: fast motion, slow motion, camera pans, bullet time, the works, but they're all used appropriately to thrill us, not overused as gimmicks. During the fight, Mok manages to handcuff herself to Hsu Qi, which leads to great close-up one-handed fighting.
As for the plot, oh well, it's predictable and often, totally implausible. The opening action sequence, in which Hsu Qi sticks herself to the ceiling while assassinating an evil executive, is quite unbelievable. And it's scored to the Carpenters' annoying song ""Close to You."" The film's conclusion is even less satisfying: after all the laws that've been broken, none of the heroines go to jail? Oh, c'mon.
But it's worth it just to see Karen Mok and Hsu Qi duke it out in cute outfits! If you want a Hsu Qi movie and are deciding between this and ""The Transporter"", go for this.",1070236800,3,3222,4.911926605504587
1946174,3,B0000U0X1Q,"I'm not quite sure what the makers of 'So Close' are trying to achieve with this movie... there aren't enough laughs or sexy action to make this the 'charlie's angels' clone the packaging will tell you it is.
It seems to want to be serious drama at the same time, with the strangely overdeveloped background of the relationship of Shu Qi's character and her boyfriend a prime example.
Speaking of Shu Qi, she's the prime reason I hired the DVD, but she kinda disapears after the first half of the movie, with all the emphasis going on to her far less appealing companions.
Still has some fun scene though, and the big finale is worth watching... it's just a pity they couldn't make up their mind as to what sort of movie they were making.",1069718400,,738,4.474074074074074

And the action actually got more intense then. I viewed this several times when i received it, just to make sure that I missed nothing. The action, story line, and action was top shelf! I had seen Shu Qi in The Transporter, but that role didn't come close to reveling the range and abilities that she has! I was greatly impressed with the leading stars, especially Zhao Wei, who I initially thought of ""soft."" But Karen Mok, that female has glaring talent! Overall, I would recommend this film greatly!

1946215,4,B0000U0X1Q,"Others are correct, this action film's realism gets undercut by the Richard Avedon glamour throughout its action sequences. It slows only to reflect upon its course of action, which falsely adds only momentary slices of reality. Nonetheless, the token romantic interludes fade as the action quickens to a violent, yet unpredictable conclusion. The female leads are appealing on several levels: they are all physical charmers, very easy on the eyes. Qi Shu as (Lynn), elder sister to Zhao Wei (Sue) tires of her bossiness in the assassin business while dreamily ruling with Angie Dickinson looks and no-nonsense over her upstart sister. You wonder if the sisters' ambitions will endure the challenges against their dangerous male counterparts when you get surprised when a rival policewoman, Karen Mok (Kong Yat-hung) catches on to their schemes. Unlike U.S. chick-flicks, the plot twists enough to ramp-up the action, while the romance simmers. The good news here is that the chops, kicks and gun-fu is as amazing as the gorgeous leads.",1392940800,2,1036,5.246987951807229

Using my best Joe Bob: Gratuitous Carpenters' tune, gratuitous satellite CCTV images, hot lips and bod of Shu Qi, cuteness factor turned way up for Zhao Wei offset by Karen Mok's plain Jane looks, tatami fu, samurai sword fu (why an HK Chinese dude was into Japanese stuff beats me and we are never told why), car chase fu through streets of HK, elevator fu and more titillation than real sexual tension throughout.

Solid plot with good visuals. Some of the CGI was slightly sub par though.",1311379200,,142,4.461538461538462
1946234,5,B0000U0X1Q,"So I bought this movie because I am a bit of a fan of Shu Qi. I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a deeply fascinating movie, and while I didn't find it as emotionally powerful as some other positive reviewers, I thought it provided a fascinating look into another culture as well as an insightful critique of gender roles in the modern world. This is mixed with three gorgeous Asian women carrying guns and engaging in martial arts battles.

The premise of the story is based on the idea that there has been an invention which allows hacking of CCTV systems via satellite. This allows false images to be displayed as well as surveillance to be carried out. This was originally intended as a police tool but has fallen into the hands of two sisters who are professional hitwomen. After one hit, a female detective who has run into the glass ceiling begins to track them and their stories become deeply intertwined.

The movie plays with gender roles, romance, and sexual themes (both straight and lesbian) throughout but often in rather unusual ways. The women are all somewhat liminal figures, existing only on the fringes of accepted society, trying to survive in what is pretty clearly a man's world.  All those in power in the police department or the corporations are male.

One gets a sense of different approaches to how this is addressed. For example there is a scene when the detective and her (male) partner are waiting in a car and she decides to engage in a little bit of hazing (and what we'd pretty clearly think of as sexual harassment if the roles were reversed) which was genuinely pretty funny. So too with the sisters: Lynn just wants to settle down and have a normal life, but Sue wants glory and revenge.  We get to know the women, their romantic aspirations, their past traumas, their hopes, their fears. The story has has tragedy, comedy, romance, action, and suspense but overall carries with it a strong feminine sense beyond just the choice of characters. In some ways, the viewer is immersed into a world and the minds (and even spirits) of the characters in a way which few action movies ever do.

I'd highly recommend this movie.",1307232000,,2169,4.650130548302872

1946236,3,B0000U0X1Q,"Once again the positive user reviews prompted me to see this flick. (I must be some sort of chump) And though it's by no means a bad flick, it was difficult for me to see what everyone was so excited about.

This is a John Woo-ish sort of action, crime thriller, but with a high tech facet to it. Two sisters are a professional hit organization. The younger sister does a lot of background and high tech stuff while the older sister performs the hits themselves. One job goes wrong and brings them into the radar of a very sharp female detective and on the wrong side of some very strong and wealthy crime dudes. Now they have much to worry about and they'll need to figure out how to get themselves out of some deep kimchi.

The plot is decent enough and the production values are top shelf. My problem is with the directing. A movie like this is made for its action, and you'd be hard pressed to find better shot and choreographed fight and action scenes than you'll find here. The problem might be that they're too clean and well choreographed. They lack any real sense of violence. There is no feel of power or that visceral gut clenching you should experience while watching a great action scene. It's all just too....nice. As in John Woo's ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"", you'll have a scene where a seemingly endless supply of bad guys descend on the good guys with guns ablazin' and they won't hit squat but they'll get wiped out wholesale. The same thing happens here but it just doesn't have the same impact.

This is fun enough and you really get a liking for the female detective. She's not really pretty but she's got something going for her. She's sharp, tough and a great fighter. (Her butt's really great as well) But I digress. If you're hopelessly hooked on Hong Kong action flicks, then have at it. If not......then...don't have at it.",1285891200,3,1854,4.4955489614243325
1946237,5,B0000U0X1Q,"Aargh! How come stupid romances always get in the way of a good assassination movie? Beautiful Shu Qi (THE TRANSPORTER, GORGEOUS) and Zhao Wei (SHAOLIN SOCCER) are simply wonderful playing two sisters who hire out as exceptional hi-tech killers-for-hire. Or, rather, Lynn (Shu Qi) does the field work while Sue (Zhao Wei) provides tech support as the eye in the sky, thanks to the all-access computer surveillance system the girls have inherited from their murdered father. Everything is going swimmingly until Lynn's boyfriend re-enters the picture, and this consequently has Lynn pondering early retirement from the wetworks gig. Stupid romances.

On the other hand, Sue sees this as the perfect opportunity to branch out, to get some actual field experience. Thing is, she's always been the more impetuous sister and she likes to play games. She can't quite kick as much behind as her older, more accomplished sibling. And she gets in trouble.

To make things even more interesting, a maverick detective from the Hong Kong police forensics department (Karen Mok) is poking her nose into the sisters' latest kill, and this detective is uncannily perceptive and is herself pretty handy with the acrobatic smiting of opponents. One of the clues she picks up on is the song ""Close To You"" which Sue plays to eff with the communications system of the latest fortress Lynn had infiltrated while on the job. It's just nice to see Karen Carpenter again made relevant.

Things come to a head when the sisters' last contractor decides to put the hit on them. The hit business, it's a tough business.

Panache, panache, panache... and maybe some elan... suffuse this film. Even after all this time, when it comes to martial arts goodness, Hollywood's still got nothing on the Asian film market. 2002's SO CLOSE (a.k.a. ""Chik Yeung Tin Si"") is a sexy and stylish action thriller. It gives us an electric ballet of long legs and high kicks, and tons and tons of bullets, and the gorgeous Shu Qi. Shu Qi, exquisitely fashionable and lethal and apparently quite defiant of the laws of gravity, sets the early tone during the film's first extended action blast. Corey Yuen, who stages fight scenes like it's a holy calling, follows that up with even more bravura sequences. There's Karen Mok's taking on of goons in an elevator in what has to be a bit of nightmarish choreography set in a confined space. Later, two women fight each other while handcuffed together. And then Corey Yuen tops everything with an unbelievable all-out slugfest in which the main bad guy more than lives up to his hype. He is one badarse sword master. Even the girls ganging up on him... well, he's more than a match for them.

Thankfully, the screenplay, which does go down a predictable route (excepting one shocking plot twist), drops enough emotional content to make you care about the characters, especially the two sisters. And, let's not forget, there's also the offbeat touches, such as Karen Carpenter's clingy song and the detective developing a restrained sort of crush. I'm also pretty fond of the detective's geeky assistant, who frequently finds himself out of his league and yet he's got gumption to spare. But maybe he shouldn't engage his blunt boss in those awkward Truth or Dare sessions, eh? Talk about emasculating...",1278806400,,3303,4.944144144144144
1946238,4,B0000U0X1Q,"This movie is not a great film but it is a lot of fun to watch.  The action packed gem from Hong Kong follows the genre but without the usual ultra violence or bumbling policeman. Actually, there are the usual bumbling policemen but it has an ultra sharp female detective pitted against our two young sisters who are assassins with a purpose.  They do have the sisters dressed in skimpy clothing but, hey, that's what sells and it was not offensive to me.

The fighting scenes are impossible but amazing to watch.  The female detective disarming two thugs in an elevator is a great scene.  This movie excels at the fast paced action sequences.  The plotline isn't bad either.  Two high tech sisters fight for their family's honor with deadly accuracy.  After the older sister rekindles an old love, she wants to walk another path as the younger one - always looking to one up her sister - tries to go alone.  A remake of the Carpenter's song ""Close To You,"" plays to remind us that the crimes are committed on their family's behalf and as a way to stay connected.

The movie is in subtitles (no conversations to interrupt the beautiful action sequences) but offers an English dubbed version.  A great adrenaline fueled by estrogen movie.",1254355200,2,1237,4.654377880184332

1946241,5,B0000U0X1Q,"I watched this film on DVD three years after it was released, and wished I'd seen it theatrically for the full effect. The story is very fast-paced and it is rich in originality and entertainment value. Model-turned-actress, Shu Qi (The Transporter) plays a gun-for-hire, and together with her brainy sister played by Zhao Wei (Shaolin Soccer) these espionage specialists use their late, murdered father's advanced secret satellite technology to give them the field advantage over their enemies and the local law enforcement.

Since they are ridding the world of evil men, you can't help but want them to succeed undetected, and they do for awhile. However, in the aftermath of their latest successful mission, an intelligent Police Detective, played by singer and actress, Karen Mok (Around the World in 80 Days) is assigned to their case and is able to track them down. It's a cat and mouse plot that fails to please. There is a sub-plot involving a love interest between Shu Qi and a man from her past that slows the story down a little, but it was probably added to permit the viewer time to breath and take a bathroom break, because I see no other purpose for it. There is no character development with this guy, and every time he shows up, you just want to groan. The good news is that not much time is spent on this love angle, so don't hesitate to get a copy of this exhilarating film. You will not be disappointed!

1946243,4,B0000U0X1Q,"SO CLOSE is directed by renowned action choreographer; Corey Yuen (Transporter). Corey is a sought after action director with his fresh style and cool attitude. (He isn't as renowned as the legendary Yuen Woo-ping but he's close). ""So Close"" may give an impression that it is a ""Charlie's Angels"" knock-off and while it does look inspired by the idea, it successfully sidesteps that boundary and turned out to be one of the most entertaining flicks I've seen back in 2002. It is way better than the stupid remake with Barrymore and Diaz and it features three of the current hottest Hong Kong actresses.  I'm a bit broke for the holidays so excuse me if I just dig into my existing collection to write my next review.

Lynn (Shu Qui, My Wife is a Gangster 3) and Sue (Vicky Zhao Wei, Shaolin Soccer) are stunningly beautiful sisters with a job unlike any other. They are intelligent, sexy and lethal women who are also the most ""in-demand"" assassins in the city. They never miss and seems like they are unstoppable; until police detective Hong (Karen Mok) becomes hot on their trail. However, Inspector Hong may have to take a second look on where her loyalties lie...

Non-stop action is the main draw for ""So Close"". Corey Yuen once again proves why he is a forced to be reckoned with when it comes to fast-paced action sequences. The martial arts scenes are truly lovely to behold, and while Shu Qui and Vicky Zhao aren't well-trained fighters in real life, but they sure look awesome performing the scenes. Corey still manages to pull off something fresh, stylish and downright sexy! The action sequence are hard-hitting but doesn't lose that feminine touch. Highlights include a close quarters  mano-o-mano fight between Mok and Shu Qui; the fight is so well-choreographed that is so refreshing to watch. There is also a great car chase with Vicky Zhao with Shu Qui aiding her escape via satellite positioning while she fights off bad guys. Corey's talent shines through with the creativeness of the sequences and the mastery of their execution. Fantastic fights, sexy poses, alluring smiles are what's in store for you!

Now, I'm not saying that ""So Close"" is a perfect film but it is a very entertaining actioner. Despite the typical and unoriginal ""cat and mouse"" game, the film is a delight to watch. Also, the performances of Taiwanese actress Shu Qui and Hong Kong's own Zhao Wei offer a lot of depth for a hyped-up action film. Their characters are well-rounded and their acting skills (while not the best they've done) are fitting for the plot that manages to add a little ""meat"" to its unoriginality. Karen Mok may not be the sexiest of the bunch but she is a delight to watch; her ""tough cop"" character adds a little flare of masculinity mixed in feminine sexiness in the proceedings. While it did lose some of its momentum in the 2nd act that it almost fell to the canned melodrama entrapment, the final act of the film provided one of the most stylish, hyper-accelerated fight sequences that more than made up for its faults.

This action film is geared towards males but I'm pretty sure women will enjoy it also with its ""women with guns"" theme. I thought that this was one of the best imports I've seen in 2002 and well worth repeated viewings. My raging male hormones aside, the film successfully put everything together and gave me one of the most entertaining movie watching experience I've had in a long time.

SO CLOSE overshadowed all my expectations that it was another ""Martial Angels"" or Charlie's Angels"" cardboard cutout copy; instead I was treated to an alluringly SEXY action film that is truly delightful to watch. The producers of the stupid ""Charlie's Angels"" franchise should take notes from this film on how to make the next sequel (If any). It is indeed FRESH and extremely raw. ""SO CLOSE"" offers a lot of martial arts action, bullet ballet and ultra-hot exotic women. It has ALL the factors any man will truly enjoy and is worthy of his dvd collection.

SO CLOSE is a welcome addition to the ""Girls who kick butt"" genre.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4 stars]",1196640000,,4089,4.747887323943662
1946244,4,B0000U0X1Q,"There something about this movie I love, It over uses everything really, the song Close To You-by the Carpenters, is played about 5 times through out the film it seemed they could only really afford this one song and they used it till it died.  But it works; it's like a true 60's film with its one song.

Other then that the story and acting is nothing crazy, it's a simple revenge tale with some great hints a romance.  This is what made the film for me it was the interest between the hit-man sister and the female cop.  The way the camera handles it, letting them find their attraction instead of telling me that they attracted so when it culminates in the end it feels right leaving me the viewer satisfied with the end result of the romance.

This is important also the fact that there is this homosexual romance in the film existing with out being told it homosexual it great, there is no coming out story it is simple attraction, two people finding them selves wanting the other.  As true romance works in real life, whether we let it or not attraction is simply something that happens not something that must be defined and that's what this film does so well it just lets it be.  While still respecting the other sister romance with a male.

Gay films have found themselves lost in the story of coming out, and living with being gay in a straight society, but this film break these lines and defines itself inside a action movie non the less, while still caring on with the story of revenge.

I give this movie, 4 stars because of the smile on my face after I watch it as well as the willingness to make a romance film that breaks straight and gay standards.",1186617600,2,1667,4.386363636363637

Obviously, my expectation levels were very low.

I have since watched it no less than 50 times.

Highly entertaining, visually splendid, action-packed, funny, great (and original!) fight sequences...this is an action movie at it's best.

Qi Shu, dressed in a white suit, is so hot!  I was hesitant to watch this film because someone told me that it's just another ""Charlie's Angel's"" type film only asian style.

Well, I'd give any movie a try that has gorgeous girls in it.  Especially asian and indian films, but this one had some typical american style blockbuster action that helped sell itself to the American audience.

These girls are beautiful, and their roles were very stylish.  Qi Shu's little sister Zhao Wei portrays a very innocent, however ambitious, partner with her sister in following up on their murdered father's high-tech computer satellite surveillance technology.

Karen Mok plays a rookie detective who is after these two clever killers-for-hire however she learns more about their ""morally-sound higher purpose"" intentions and struggles with her job as an undercover detective, and wanting to help the girls with their intentions of saving the world from high-tech corruption.

Other slightly cheesy ""babefest"" films that I would like to recommend are ""D.E.B.S."", ""Chasing Papi"", ""Bride and Prejudice"" (Indian film with Aishwarya Rai), ""Mean Girls"", ""View From The Top"", ""Man of the House"", and ""Alfie"" (with Jude Law).  And I'm sure that there are plenty more films where just being a ""babefest"" on film is the overall intention.

Another important asian film (made in America) is ""The Joy Luck Club"".

I try not to take movies too seriously.  I usually enjoy the art of the visuals more.  And seeing pretty girls being kinda ""dingy"" has a way of being fun, too.  However, this movie had beautiful ""intelligent"" girls.

However, for the sake of ""babefests"", for some reason, I just couldn't get into ""Charlie's Angel's"".  The original TV series of Charlie's Angel's is still great though.",1162684800,8,1959,5.113207547169812
1946250,4,B0000U0X1Q,"You will NOT find the meaning of life in this movie, but if you want to veg out and enjoy a good action flick, this is it. When I saw the opening shots of Hong Kong, all glitzy with neon lights, I knew this movie was going to be cheesy. The assassin with her ""controller"" guiding her through the job reminded me of Max Headroom circa 1987, and I decided to enjoy this movie for what it was.

The action scenes were excellent despite the CGI effects of flying bullets and shattering glass. My only complaint was the soap opera-like plot line where Ai Lin wants to stop being an assassin because she fell in love. (Cue sappy music!) And I can't believe that her wholesome boyfriend would have handled things so easily when he found out what she did for a living.

I also wish there was a little more background on the sisters becoming assassins--all we know is that businessmen broke into their house (to steal her father's invention) and killed their parents and one of the businessmen inexplicably turned on his partners and gave one of the girls a gun to fight back. Oh, and after Ai Lin died, her sister cried for what seemed like ten minutes and it was freaking depressing!

Still, the action was great and the most of the movie was fast paced. And as a woman, it's nice to see women kick butt on screen. (I'll ignore the tight clothes and the tops that are strategically slashed during fighting, revealing the heroins' bras.)

I do not care for main characters getting killed, but once in a while it's okay. It gives my ""film reality"" a jolt, something it needs. As a female assassin, Shu Qi ranks at the top rank of cinematic killers. I have no doubt that she could kill Arnold, Clint Eastwood or Mel Gibson in any film roles.

1946260,4,B0000U0X1Q,"When I first saw the DVD cover,
I immediately thought that this
movie was going to be an oriental-flavored
rip off of Charlies Angels (I mean, the
assasin's codename is Computer Angel, for Christ's sake).
However, the movie turned out to be
very entertaining.

I was most surprised at how the character spotlight shifted,
making the quieter, demure sister the main character. Also,
the Cop and the same quiet sister become a dynamic, revenge-fuelled wrecking force.

I am being careful not to give away too much of the plot (or
what there is of a plot) because there are some surprises
in store for the first time viewer.

The movie gets off to an awesome start, but then starts
to drag as soon as an old love interest resurfaces. At this
point, feel free to balance your checkbook or start knitting
a sweater. However, prepare yourself when the Assasin sister
makes an announcement that will dramatically affect both of
their lives. Soon after, the actions picks up and the action
packed roller coaster ride doesn't let up until closing credits.

For the most part, the fight scenes are exceptional. However,
the computered generated settings sometime get ridiculous. Also,
a couple of the karate moves are too absurb to even be included
in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" aka ""the Godfather of Over the Top Fight Scenes""
(or even the close runner up, ""Matrix"").

My greatest surprise is how emotional this film is. The writers
apparently took great care in producing a tear jerker out of
a usually emotionless type of film.  The ending is very good.

entertain everyone.",1114473600,,1635,4.88086642599278

For an Asian action movie I would normally expect the cast to be a bunch of men, most of the leads here are women and they are all given strong roles. I ran the movie with English subtitling instead of English dubbing and had no problems keeping up with the story.

The action scenes tended to be very impressive, not Jackie Chan comical, although occaisionally a little overwrought -as believeable as such a movie can be.

My biggest complaint was that the computer generated flying glass in a couple of scenes looked CG, a little of a distraction. The car chase in which the younger sister was guided by satellite link up with her older sister had a look that was fresh to me, not like the usual American chase.

I'm not really unhappy with the movie, it was probably meant to be a check your brain at the door type film and it's actually better than that. I don't regret owning it.",1110326400,2,1070,4.388888888888889
1946262,4,B0000U0X1Q,"Three beauties from Asia join in this martial-arts action flick directed by Corey Yuen, of 'Transporter' fame.  The merit of this film lie not only in the eyecandy look, but also in the fact that the three actresses are really doing the ballet-dancing-like, high-kicking actions.

Contrary to our expectations, the film is not Asian version of 'Charlie's Angels.'  The story is about two female assassins (Shu Qi 'Transpoter' and Vicky Chao 'Shaolin Soccer' without make-uo here) and one female cop (Karen Mok Jet Li's 'Black Mask') chasing them.  As the police investigate the killing of the president of a giant computer company, they detect the presence of two sisters dealing with the dirty business on net.

Then the beautiful sisters, equipped with high-technology and martial-arts skills, then are going to do another job, which turn out bigger and nastier than they thought.

The plot is nothing important.  The action-packed and unpretentious film does not hide that it is a popcorn movie made for fun, and it provides lots of it.  But well, some may think the film is sometimes a tad too violent, and there is a very sexual nuance between the two sisters (look how the sisters playfully 'fight' each other in ... the bathroom, quite unique version of cat fighting, or male fantasy if you like).

THREE HOT LADIES from Asian are all fantastic.  Interestingly, with potential market in mind, the film's actresses are selected from three differenct parts of Asia -- Vicky Chao from mainland China, Karen Mok from Honk Kong, and Shu Qui from Taiwan.  You also have a guest appearance from Japan, Yasuaki Kurata, whose name was seen in many Hong Kong-made kung-hu films.

Corey Yuen is clearly having fun with the action sequences, which are beutifully staged.  And as I said above, what is most impressive is that the film shows three ladies really doing the action part.  One of the few defects of 'Kill Bill' was that Uma Thurman was using the stunt.  In this film, when the ladies kick, they use their own bodies.

Mindless, to be sure, but as far as the actions go, it's the first-rate.  Just enjoy watching it.",1109635200,,2121,4.847222222222222
1946263,5,B0000U0X1Q,"I wanted to see this film ever since I got it, cuz it had asian girls in it, and I love asain girls.  I kept hoing it didn't have a feel to it like Charlie's angels did, but I was glad, because this movie would have easily slashed up charlie's angels in a catfight.

This movie is about Lynn, played by the beautiful Shu Qi, and her sister Sue(Zhao Wei) who own a big business after their parents got murdered and they inherited it.  They become big contract killers, and eleimiate a bigtime computer owner, and are on the run.  But undercover officer Hong(Karen Mok)ain't gonna even dream of letting them off the fish hook one bit.

The action in this movie is over the top, but face it, the only other movie that has chicks kickin' this much @$$ is kill bill(Altho kill bill wasn't convincing, just bloody)  The gunfight sceenes are some of the best I've seen this year, and the swordfights are friggin' awsome.

The only thing that pissed me off was what happened 7/11 through the film.  Something like that should be illegal worldwide!  It was just plain wrong, BUT, but it was one of the few sceenes in any movie that, just made me wish SOMETHING could be done about it, usally I'd say /// it, but not this time.

Either way this movie is better more action packed, and mature than Charlie's Angels, and this movie packs a nice amount of violence to keep action fans satisfied, and enough wemon to go round.  If you love action flicks, and think this is another Charlie's Angel's I should slap you back and fourth.  Cuz this is just one of those rare gems that come by.  And at the end it had a little bit of sensuality, only a little, but it was pretty cool.

1946265,4,B0000U0X1Q,"In a high-energy action sequence, a crooked businessman, Chow Lui, is murdered by a young woman who calls herself the Computer Angel.  It turns out that she caused some computer virus trouble the previous evening, only to reverse the effects herself.  The woman herself ranks high in the karate department but also in terms of sheer cleverness, given the way she kills the businessman.  She then proceeds to shoot many of Chow Lui's security teams, often merely disabling them.  This leads to Inspector Hong Yat Kong to deduce that she is dealing with someone who in the heat of battle was expert enough to wound and not kill.  She becomes fascinated with Chow Lui's murderer.

However, the person who hired the assassin turns out to be none other than the victim's own brother, Chow Nunn, whose motives was that he was intent on taking over the company, plus he was having an affair with his own sister-in-law.

So who are the two?  They are two sisters, Ai Linn (Lynn) and younger sister Sue, who's confined to manning the computer due to her recklessness.  Lynn is the more cool-headed, b-t-kicking professional and does her jobs while Sue uses a highly-sophisticated computerized surveillance system that allows her to direct her sister and warn her against anyone approaching.

All this is in aid to avenge the murder of their parents.  Their father had intended to give this new surveillance system to the police, had it not been for some ruthless businessmen who had other ideas.  The two thus look after each other, but with Ai Linn having the understood senior role in both their jobs and themselves as family, a la the older sibling/younger sibling of Eastern thought.

Things begin to crack when Yen, a young man Lynn would've gone out with long ago had it not been for her parents' murder, reenters her life after spending some time in America.  Lynn decides to maybe hang up her guns and settle down, as Yen seems to be a decent sort of guy.  If it were that simple... as alarmed by the suspicions of Inspector Hong, Chow Nunn decides to eliminate Lynn, and Sue becomes dissatisfied with being the one out of the action.

The interactions between Hong and the sisters prove interesting, as Hong has somewhat of a grudging respect for Lynn's skills, yet is clear in her duty to apprehend all criminals, no matter what the motive.  All three actresses, Qi Shu (Lynn), Vicki Zhao (Sue) and Karen Mok (Hong) work well together and apart, especially the very pretty Shu and the impishly pretty Zhao, who plays Mui in Shaolin Soccer.

Its use of the Carpenters' ""They Long To Be Close To You"" must set some sort of cheeky precedence, but the CGI shattering glass and Matrix-style aerial shots raises the fact how So Close is an action film of the Noughts.  And the final battle is a bit protracted.  Still, not too bad, I suppose, given the dramatic components between the sisters making it more than a mere comic book actioner.",1107129600,,2935,4.7176470588235295
1946266,5,B0000U0X1Q,"A few days ago I went to a local Best Buy.  While there I just couldn't find anything to buy.  I looked and looked for somthing interesting, somthing that would catch my eye, but alas there was nothing.  I saw the So Close DVD box, but I snubbed it because it looked like a poor quality chinese Chariles Angles wannabe.  But it was cheap and I couldn't find anything else so I bought it.  When I started watching it I thought that the so-so opening action scene was a sign of things to come.  But as the movie progressed, I found that it got better.  the plot was good and there were some seriously moving moments.
Many people think that this movie is much better than Charlies Angles Full Throttle, but it isn't really any better.  In fact, it isn't as good.  I think that So Close is a good movie, but it isn't better than Charlies Angels is.
Charlies Angels has great specal effects, decent choreography, a good cast, and a typical plot, but it isn't crap.
So Close is all of the above except is has worse specal effects (the broken glass in the movie looked so phony) but has a better story.  So Close is a Charlies Angels wrapped in asian wrapping paper.

1946277,4,B0000U0X1Q,"Corey Yuen's So Close is the ultimate guy flick. You got three of Asia's sexiest actresses (Vicki Zhao, Su Qi and Karen Mok - in that particular order!!!) in a Mission Impossible-like caper, performing jaw-dropping stunts, brandishing high-powered firearms and doing some lesbian flirting.

I watched this movie for Vicki Zhao (also known as Zhao Wei) and Su Qi alone, but I was really impressed and satisfied by Corey Yuen's flashy set pieces, especially Su Qi's assault into a high-tech building in the opening sequence.

And oh yeah, there's also a plot! It's straight out of geekdom, With Su Qi and her sister Zhao Wei as assassins for hire, out to take revenge on the people who killed their parents because of their dad's invention, a high-tech, powerful Big Brother surveillance software. Standing on their way is a big evil corporation and its thugs, led by a CEO with samurai delusions.

Exciting and fast-paced, So Close gives thrills and overall entertainment enough for three Hollywood movies. On second thought, it has so much going and the storytelling is not that fluid, it feels like three Hollywood movies",1100131200,4,1122,4.989304812834225
1946278,4,B0000U0X1Q,"As in many Hong Kong movies story is just ok but none the less this is a very stylish movie to watch. The girls are gourgeous, dressed to kill and perform their fights as if it was ballet. However, if you are expecting anything more than that you'll be dissapointed.",1094083200,2,266,4.34
1946279,5,B0000U0X1Q,"I sat through Corey Yuen's The Transporter because Jason Statham was so cool in Guy Ritchie's films. While viewing that, I was captivated by Qi Shu, which is probably not too difficult to comprehend after seeing her. On that note, when I found this movie selling for $10, I picked it up.

I really wasn't expecting much, other than beautiful women and some wire-fu.

However, I had a fabulous time watching this. For what this film lacks in originality, it makes up for in visual entertainment and style. Granted, even the style seems greatly influenced by John Woo, Yuen Wo Ping, Luc Besson, and Hollywood, but regardless it was such a cool viewing experience.

The filming locations are great, the CGI is cool (a little too much in some scenes, but overall well done), the wire-fu didn't irritate me too much, and the charisma of the acting talent was breathtaking. Im also a guy, and Asian, so Im sure the fact that they are beautiful Asian women kept my attention, but they still packed some serious Asian flair. Furthermore, there was very little exposed flesh, but the facial features and the hair, not to mention the outfits (and the women themselves), were simply stunning. I also enjoyed how one of the villains was the gent from Jet Li's Fist of Legend. He was very cool in that film, and was equally enthralling here.

The basic plot itself is nothing award winning, but the few twists and turns really helped it. The soundtrack was pretty good, and fit into the slow motion scenes well. I had just finished watching an episode of The Simpsons where Marge buys the musical doorbell playing ""Close to You"", so when the song came on it threw me for a laugh, but it was a nice sharp contrast to the action on-screen. Both the sword fighting scenes and the John Woo gunslinging were entertaining, but the parking lot fight scene was fabulous.

I am really proud of myself for investing money into this film. Its definitely lots of eye candy, but theres nothing wrong with that. Oddly enough, I ended up being more captivated by Vicki Zhao than Qi Shu. Whenever she gave that slightly angled look at the camera it made me sit a little closer to the TV.

But anyway, this is a great action flick, fitted with girls kicking some serious butt, some pretty cool cinematography, good fight scenes, and a very high entertainment value.",1091664000,4,2335,4.655339805825243
1946280,5,B0000U0X1Q,"I had very little expectations when my brother-inlaw asked me to watch this DVD with him. I have been watching Hong Kong produced action films since the 70's and I thought here we go again with wall-to-wall fighting, marginal cinematography, bad dubbing and cheesey soundtrack. To say I was pleasantly surprised at what a great show this one turned out to be is a total understatement.

 Many would complain that the plot is on the weak side. I certainly agree that the screenplay is not going to win any major accolades, but for the genre which normally has little or no plot, this one is logical and relatively easy to follow. It even has a sad twist which might cause a few tears to be shed.

 Where this film really shines though is in its presentation. The modern sets, the brilliantly choreographed fighting sequences and the wonderfully executed yet not overdone special effects give this film an ultra-slick and ultra-chique look. The female leads are drop dead gorgeous. They exude abundant sex-appeal even though they are not sexually exploited to any extent in the film. The plot line and action is well paced and should keep audience glued to their seats.

 This review would not be complete without a mention of the sound track. The inclusion of the 1970 Carpenters' megahit ""Close to You"" has been much maligned by a number of reviewers. I personally think the use of this song in the opening fighting scene is nothing short of absolute brilliance. The slow, soulful strains of the ballad is such an antithesis to the fast paced fighting action on the screen that the brilliant combination of the two gives these sequences an almost surreal quality. The viewer feels a sudden sense of detachment from the action and the effect is very powerful indeed. The rest of the soundtrack is well selected and complements the scenes very well. I am extremely glad that the film scorer did not include too much ear screeching heavy metal clips which are so prevalent in this genre of film. Kudos to him (or her)!!!

 Lastly, this film has most commonly been compared to Charlie Angels I and II mostly because of the coincidental presence of three female leads in this film. Even though So Close handily beats both the Angels films , a much more worthy comparison would be with the Tarantino film ""Kill Bill I"". Without exagerration, So Close gives Kill Bill more than its run for its money.

 For those who haven't seen it, buy the DVD now for your collection. You will not regret it! This eye candy is a definite TEN!!!",1091491200,2,2523,4.700680272108843

The Plot and sub-plot were carried out so well, props for the writter. The drama part of the movie made my girlfriend near the end, man it got to me too at a certain point the flashback part.
But anyway, the Action! unlike any other... definatly OUTSTANDING, way better than Charles' Angels. you know what Charles' Angles is no comparison, man the parking lot scene was THE best! Su qi and xiao wei are like a dynamic dual that kick buTT and Karen MOk man... can do anything.

1946297,4,B0000U0X1Q,"First, do not go into the movie with expectations of ""Charlie's Angels.""  Yes, there are three women in here, but it is not an HK rehash.
My fiance gave the movie 3 stars for the cool action sequences and the strong female characters (she hates the whiny damsel-in-distress types), but she felt that the movie was weak in story and pointed out a few plot holes.  I, myself, thought that the development of certain characters was lacking.  However, I  forgave that lack of certain character development because of 1) Shu Qi and Zhao Wei, 2) Awesome action and did I mention Shu Qi and Zhao Wei?  The strength and knock-out beauty of these two women made the movie.  It was certainly nice to be able to watch the movie under the guise of it being a tough-chick flick that women love.
The movie starts off slow at times, but when the action starts picking up, you start to ignore some of the questions raised at the beginning of the movie.  While in general, the action was kick-butt, the wire use was poorly done in certain scenes as were the use of doubles, but since Shu Qi and Zhao Wei aren't exactly action stars in Hong Kong, I didn't expect them to do their own stunts or fight scenes, although in some close up shots, they did hold their own very well.
I don't think this movie deserves a full five stars because of certain character development problems and some story problems, but I didn't go into the movie expecting an Oscar-caliber movie.  It is what it is--a great way to spend a mindless Sunday afternoon, watching beautiful women wearing revealing outfits shooting, blowing up and beating the bad guys senseless.
Like my title mentions, this is the quintessential guy movie, with cool gadgets, lots of computers, tons of action (you name it, it's in there:  car chases, hand-to-hand combat, guns) and beautiful women.  And the movie is sexy without being degrading (no nudity, bikinis or lingerie), so guys, your girlfriends won't smack you on the head for watching it (except for a certain shower-fight scene).

Oh, how I love eye candy... This one has girls, gadgets, some good actions scene and oh some teasers of some of the girls...
The last time we saw Qi Shu was in ""The Transporter"" where her character was the opposite of the one she plays in the movie. From the beginning we see that the movie looks like it will live up to the description with the CGI graphics. Next we see Lynn Qi Shu and then the first action scene starts. There is free use of wire acrobatics with subtle moves that put a smile on your face. Then from there we meet each of the other main two characters, Sue her sister and Hong Yat Hong the CSI investigating the crime scene.
There are plenty of subplots and a big twist and turn here and there. Sometimes it seems predictable, but only to a certain point. I could tell you more of the plot, but the individual pieces are nothing orginal except when that kink in thrown in there it takes the overall feel of the movie on a different direction.
Like I said earlier, you will have trust me on this one, this picture is worth a millon words. My writing skills are nowhere near up to the task of describing the action.
Audio: Viewed in Mandarin 5.1 with English Subtitles. Well I just moves, I only had 3.1 sound (no sides) but the audio was clear and there was a good ampount of directionality across the three main speakers. The subtitles were very good, no gramatical errors I could detect. I do not speak Mandarin so I cannot speak of translation errors.
