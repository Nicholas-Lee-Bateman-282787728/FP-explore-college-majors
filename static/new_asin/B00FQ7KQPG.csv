6020069,3,B00FQ7KQPG,Great service.  The workout is intense!  I'm a 40 year old guy in average shape and this workout actually caused me health problems.  It's like yoga which I love but on steroids.  Be careful!,1428364800,4,191,4.529411764705882
6020070,4,B00FQ7KQPG,Really works every part of your body in a Thai chi sort of way.,1428364800,4,63,3.5714285714285716
6020071,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"This video was very helpful in improving my Essentrics/Classical Stretch technique. Sahra is very clear in her demonstration/instruction--it has helped me quite a bit with my shoulders (recovering from 2 frozen shoulders).
Working out with Sahra got me better grounded in the Essentrics/Classical Stretch technique.  Although I enjoyed the Classical Stretch dvds I didn't realize I was missing some fundamentals--and now really love them!",1424044800,15,438,5.84375
6020072,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"Essentrics is a stretching-based workout routine which was developed by instructor Sahra Esmonde-White and her mother, Miranda Esmonde-White, creator of Classical Stretch.  Like Classical Stretch, Essentrics incorporates some elements of barre, PNF, yoga, and athletic stretch, all with a focus dynamically lengthening and strengthening all of the muscles of the body.  However, Essentrics appears to have been designed to appeal to younger audiences, including using Sahra as the instructor and incorporating slightly more upbeat music.

Sahra teaches this workout live; she is featured by herself in same location as several of her prior DVDs, the Montreal Science Center.  The only equipment needed for the routine is a chair for the ""barre"" work and a mat for the floor work.  In terms of exercises, the ESSENTRICS BARRE WORKOUT is quite similar to previous Essentrics DVD releases (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essentrics-Strength-Stretch-in-Motion/dp/B0089PCXAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essentrics Strength & Stretch in Motion</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essentrics-Arms-Abs-Waist-Toner-Legs-Butt-Thigh-Thinner/dp/B001QX6KTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essentrics Arms, Abs & Waist Toner / Legs, Butt & Thigh Thinner</a>).  The main difference with this BARRE workout is the structure, which offers a variety of premixes.  When you play the DVD, you are immediately taken to a short introduction by Sahra (which is skippable).  The main menu of the DVD is labeled ""Select Your Pre-Mixed Workout,"" and it provides the options listed below.  Not that the first segment is the name of the pre-mix and the second is the chapters included in that pre-mix.

Power Full Body Tone | Standing Barre Toning | 30 MIN
Thigh Thinning Workout | Standing - Floor Toning - Barre Toning | 40 MIN
Hips, Back and Hamstring Stretch | Standing - Floor Stretch - Barre Stretch | 30 MIN
Essentrics Full Body Workout | Complete Toning and Stretching Workout | 60 MIN

At the bottom of the main menu, there is the option to ""view each segment separately.""  This is the chapter menu.  Below I have included each chapter along with additional information of the exercises included and actual times (in parentheses).

STANDING | Abs, Waist, Arms and Posture | 15 MIN (14.5m)
Sahra begins with a typical essentrics/Classical Stretch warm-up, including both upper body stretches and kicks.  She then moves into a stretch sequence that includes Figure 8s for the arms, beach ball moves, and table rotations.  She also includes standing waist/abs work with exercises such as clock variation.  The standing work concludes with an arms sequence:  Sahra takes the exercises slowly, which makes them tough!  The final move is the star, which I've never seen before.

FLOOR TONING | Thigh and Quad Toning | 9 MIN (10m)
Sahra begins with a short but intense series of side-lying leg work.  First she does several moves for the inner thighs, then she moves to outer thigh lifts, including both to the side and to the front.  Coming to seated, she performs a series of straight leg lifts to finish.

FLOOR STRETCH | Hips, Back and Hamstrings | 7 MIN (7.5m)
Sahra continues seated for PNF stretches in a butterfly position.  Coming to lying on her back, she moves through a Figure 4 stretch, baby stretch, and additional hip/butt work.  Returning to seated, she performs several additional stretches for the hips, hamstrings, and IT band.

BARRE TONE | Legs, Butt and Tricep Toning | 15 MIN (15.5m)
Standing at the chair, Sahra starts with bent leg push backs to work the butt.  Next, she performs straight leg kicks to the side and to the front.  A series of plies follows, adding in heel lifts.  Sahra also performs a short series of close position plies and then a second side of side-legged plies, this time adding in arms.  Sahra concludes this toning segment with just a few stretching moves, including stretching the side, moving hip stretches, and a standing quad stretch.

BARRE STRETCH | Complete Hip, Back and Lower Body Stretch | 15 MIN (16m)
This is a thorough stretch using the barre.  Sahra begins with the calves/ankles and moves on to gentle hip/hamstring stretches.  She then moves more intensely into stretches for the hips and hamstrings and especially the quads and hip flexors.  To finish, Sahra performs a more gentle stretch for the shoulders and a standing ""grab elastics"" stretch.

Since I like to use Classical Stretch and Essentrics routines as add-ons to my cardio and strength workouts, the format of this DVD was perfect for me.  I thought that Sahra did a great job with the instruction, and I loved the inclusion of a few new moves here.  Definitely recommended, particularly for fans of the Classical Stretch and Essentrics series.",1415923200,39,4829,5.356763925729443
6020073,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"If you have any neck and shoulder issues, this is the place to be.  Sarah and her mother, Miranda Esmonde-White are life savers!  I now want the whole season 9 dvd!!  Easy to do and amazing benefits if you stick with these two.",1413849600,22,227,4.232558139534884
6020074,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"This was one of those, not-so-sure if I liked it or not! Well, after exercising to it more than a few times, I now love it! I do the entire 60 minutes even though you can select the sections that you want.
This entails a lot of stretching and lengthening using a full range of motion. I have a lot of barre/cardio inspired workouts, however; this is different in technique. I would suggest checking it out on youtube like I did; it will give you some idea of the movements involved.",1411430400,48,482,4.3076923076923075
6020075,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"I love all the Classical Stretch and Essentrics workouts!!!  The long stretching works deep into my muscles and feels so good.  Don't get me wrong, though, I really feel it the next day when I use this routine.  If you want to work your body and feel good at the same time, this is for you.",1390953600,26,290,4.142857142857143
6020076,1,B00FQ7KQPG,Really bad. I thought this would be a good workout for post spine surgery..was not. Poor quality and boring,1456272000,,107,4.684210526315789
6020077,5,B00FQ7KQPG,I absolutely love the Essentrics workouts by Sahra Esmonde-White.  Her form and cuing of exercises is excellent and the workouts are wonderful.  I highly recommend these DVDs for in-home exercises.,1455148800,,197,5.533333333333333
6020078,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"This is the best workout to date, of anything available right now. In my personal opinion, having done ballet for a significant amount of time, I prefer this over Pilate any time. This targets MORE muscles in a shorter work out. It is intense, so go slow at first. There's an hour program in this, so do your best. I can do maybe 3 leg lifts but I know I will be able to do more later as I continue tackling this ' come back'. If you can walk, you can do this. AND there is much of this that can be done sitting in a chair. So go for it. You'll thank me later! (Monk')!!",1448323200,8,570,3.9224137931034484
6020079,5,B00FQ7KQPG,timely response good quality,1447977600,,28,6.25
6020080,5,B00FQ7KQPG,If you want your butt kicked this is it but it kicks your tail to the degree you do the moves correctly. It isn't high impact and is easier on your joints than typical workouts.,1443916800,4,177,4.085714285714285
6020081,4,B00FQ7KQPG,"Great. Easy to understand what's coming up. Easy to follow. Good flow. Not sure what all the other complaints were about, except for providing a balanced view. This feels like an advanced-beginner to intermediate level program to this lifelong workout woman who wasn't in her best shape ever when picked this up. Hope that helps.",1443916800,9,329,5.0
6020082,5,B00FQ7KQPG,This helps the hitch in my wife's get-along!,1441929600,2,44,4.625

6020084,1,B00FQ7KQPG,"Received the DVD on time, but it only contains the intro and Essentrics at all.",1439683200,,79,4.333333333333333
6020085,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"I'm relatively new to Essentrics/Classical stretch, but of all of their workouts that I have tried so far, this is my favorite. I consider myself to be pretty flexible, but this stretched me in new ways I wasn't expecting, and the toning was really nice, too. I have done it a few times a week lately, and I have really noticed my posture improving since I started.",1433808000,7,365,4.462686567164179
8617945,5,B00FQ7KQPG,Hard to believe that I'm exercising. The moves are so easy and the instructions are so good. The time flys and I'm sweating but loving it.,1526688000,,138,4.346153846153846
8617946,5,B00FQ7KQPG,Sahra is a pleasure to workout with.  This is my favorite essentrics workout.,1519430400,,77,4.923076923076923
8617947,4,B00FQ7KQPG,"I'm a huge essentrics fan and the only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars here is the fact that the upper body portion was much, much shorter than the lower body, but seriously this DVD is great. Essentrics works",1499817600,,217,4.45
8617948,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"Nice set of exercises. The only set I think is not recommended is the stretching of the hips. The postures are odd and really do not help to stretch the hips but to harm them if you have issues with it. I skip the hip part and I finish the rest of the exercises which I love. Sahra is just a pleasure to follow while exercising and love that the music is not loud and annoying like many other exercise videos, this really help to relax while doing it",1494115200,,450,4.067415730337078

8617950,5,B00FQ7KQPG,A nice change a alternative to all the old stretches I've been doing over the years.,1475539200,,84,4.3125
8617951,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"Been doing the subscription and decided I didn't want to pay monthly fees. This is the same workout, but better value for me. This is part of the many diverse workouts in my library and I love it. Great addition.",1472688000,3,212,4.325
8617952,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"The first fifteen minutes of this workout is available on You Tube. This is an effective workout by itself.

After doing her short workouts on YouTube for a week, I felt a big difference in my posture and energy level. So I ordered a few of her DVDs. Easy to follow after a few times practising on YouTube. I wish they were available on instant video. I had to buy a DVD player just for this but worth it.

She has a lovely style of teaching that put me at ease. The short YouTube workouts range from 6-15 minutes but deliver a very effective workout which is good for anyone who does not have a lot of time.",1470096000,8,608,4.1440677966101696
8617953,5,B00FQ7KQPG,"I love Essentrics, and this barre routine is one of my favorites. The music is perfect, the flow is wonderful, I really feel stretched out, especially in my hips. I also feel, well, a quarter-inch taller with the posture and abs exercises. Sahra is calming and gives great tips for her moves, which really do work. You just need to take your time at the moves and not overdo it. Lovely setting, and worth getting for stretching AND strengthening.",1459468800,3,446,4.658227848101266
8617954,3,B00FQ7KQPG,"I like this workout, but I enjoy the Class of 2012 by Sahra much better.  This is different length workout on this DVD but divided up into several segments.  Not too good I would say, but if it's the only one you have it is a good workout.",1459209600,3,239,3.9583333333333335
