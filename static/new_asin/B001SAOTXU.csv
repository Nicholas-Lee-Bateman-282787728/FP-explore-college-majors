8339566,2,B001SAOTXU,"There's only so much ""instruction"" one can give via video, but this doesn't even try to instruct. You get some nice, multiple/repetitive views of each sequence, but that's it. No explanations beyond the name of the sequence. This is not to knock Ms. Liang's skill - she's obviously very skilled. One other thing - while I'm not a Bagua expert, this form looks like it is possibly intended for Wushu competition vs regular practice as many of the stances are extremely low - martial Bagua is typically described as mid height or ""middle basin"". Still, if this had verbal instructions to go with the demonstrations I would have given it five stars.",1484092800,,646,4.776785714285714

8339568,5,B001SAOTXU,This is an excellent instructional video.  The separate movements are done a number of times from different angles and slow enough to have high instructional value.  The full form is an excellent demonstration and gives the viewer and Bagua Zhang practitioner  a very clear example of what the form looks like when mastered.  Highly recommended.,1448496000,,345,5.218181818181818

8339570,5,B001SAOTXU,"Master Helen Liang is an excellent teacher, and this video takes you step by step through learning Bagua Zhang by watching her do Bagua.  Each step is repeated from different camera angles, which is very helpful.",1267574400,3,212,4.888888888888889
