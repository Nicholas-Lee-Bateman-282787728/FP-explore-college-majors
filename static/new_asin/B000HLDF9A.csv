2639164,5,B000HLDF9A,"I didn't get into NBA basketball until recently. We have no team where I live, so I chose to support the HEAT. I know, sounds bandwagon right? Well I got into the HEAT because I was awed by D-Wade and after 3 years I love this franchise. Very much enjoyed watching these, Wade was truly something else. A tip on purchasing it, wait it out. The price I noticed tends to fluctuate. I was able to buy it for 20 bucks.",1416700800,,414,4.1234567901234565

2639170,4,B000HLDF9A,"Quality of the video is not so great. I guess it's not THAT bad considering that we don't have the technology yet to get NBA league pass quality playbacks.

Price is awesome! For $38 (or it may have changed), you get all the games of the Eastern Conference Finals AND NBA finals 06. Hopefully one day they would put all the first round and second round games into the dvd set as well cause I sure as heck would buy them!

Overall, it's a great purchase for any Miami Heat fans or basketball fans in general! It's probably the last days of Shaq's prime which is great to witness again over the DVD",1364947200,,596,4.265486725663717

2639176,5,B000HLDF9A,"When I ordered this set I was excited so you can imagine what I felt when it arrived.  I had the pleasure of enjoying it first during a week of vacation during the 4th of July.  I paced myself and I enjoyed each and every minute.  I am a Chicago native, big Michael Jordan fan and now I have his little brother Dwayne Wade to watch and I am loving it completely. Even when the Heat played the Bulls I was cheering for Miami all the way. Dwayane Wade is just getting started and he provides such a thrill to cheer for.  It is also great to watch Antoine Walker, Gary Payton and Alonzo Mourning finally get the ring that have been waiting for and deserve.  Of course with the entire set you will have your favorites and mines is game 3 and 5 of the Finals.  Not to take a thing away from game 6 when they put the icing on the cake.  It is now 2007 but the Miami Heat are still my Champions and just like coach Riley said, it was just their time.  Miami Heat, well done you make me proud!!  I Love the Game.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miami-Heat-NBA-2005-2006-Champions-15-Strong/dp/B000HLDF9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miami Heat NBA 2005-2006 Champions - 15 Strong</a>",1185494400,9,1210,4.751196172248804
