Coach is such a funny show i'm glad I bought the series. I will always order my dvds from Amazon from now on.",1229385600,3,540,4.163461538461538
3036914,5,B000Z27H8Q,"The best season of ""Coach"" so far. Although this season has it's fair shair of major disappointments for Hayden Fox, the outcome is simply hilarious for us fans.

What looks set to be the best season of football for the Minnesota Screaming Eagles will probably end up being the worst due to a cruel twist of fate. While dealing with all these upsets, Hayden breaks up with Christine, Luther has his heart broken once again by Marion and lots of other interesting things pop up.

After two successful seasons the third one one really kicks into gear.
""Coach"" has never been shy of downplaying the comedy in favor of some drama and this season has some very dramatic moments, especially when Hayden and Christine break up. It's a credit to Craig T. Nelson and Shelley Fabares how well they balance their comic performances with dramatic outbursts.

But laughter is not far away and this season has some outstanding episodes. ""Magnificent Abscession"" is a personal favorite, that's the one where Hayden has some dental work done at the same time there's a major game going on and he let's Luther take charge. It's a total winner and there's a lot more of those on this season.

On hand with great support is Jerry Van Dyke and Bill Fagerbakke as the unbeatable team of assistants Luther Van Dam and Dauber Dybinski. They can make almost anything seem funny and their input is a big part of why ""Coach"" was successful for nine seasons.

Now I just wish Universal would get off their lazy behinds and release these seasons at a quicker pace. I remember lots more of good ""Coach"" moments from the time this aired on TV and I'd like that trip down memory lane before I'm an old man.",1221436800,3,1675,4.60738255033557
3036915,5,B000Z27H8Q,"I purchased coach the first, second and third season and they are all without exception great. I can't wait until some one has the 4th, 5th and 6th season offered so I can purchase those also.",1221004800,,192,4.361111111111111
3036916,5,B000Z27H8Q,Coach was a very funny situation comedy (imaginative writing is severely lacking in TV comedy today).  Coach was clever and a great casting of Jerry Van Dyke and Craig Nelson.,1214697600,4,175,4.833333333333333
3036917,5,B000Z27H8Q,"COACH is terrific!!!....  We're eagerly awaiting Season 4 (and then 5,6, and 7--""The Minnesota Years.""",1210982400,7,102,5.8
3036918,5,B000Z27H8Q,"Great show and I can't wait for the following seasons to be released. I know that it's not much of a review, but for those who enjoy comedy,this is it. The story involving and including the Bassett Hound, to me, is priceless.",1206748800,,225,4.380952380952381

3036920,5,B000Z27H8Q,"Coach is such an underrated show and this is definitely one of the best seasons. Agree with other reviews, they need to release more seasons more often. Luther and Dauber, man these shows are great, classic fun. Great humor.",1204761600,,224,4.769230769230769

I went to Amazon.com with a few days before the date, and I received the dvds right on time.  I am very happy with the dvds. My wife just loves Coach. We both watch Coach and all we do is laugh. Coach is such a funny show i'm glad I bought the series. I will always order my dvds from Amazon from now on.",1229385600,3,540,4.163461538461538
3271411,5,B000Z27H8Q,"The best season of ""Coach"" so far. Although this season has it's fair shair of major disappointments for Hayden Fox, the outcome is simply hilarious for us fans.

What looks set to be the best season of football for the Minnesota Screaming Eagles will probably end up being the worst due to a cruel twist of fate. While dealing with all these upsets, Hayden breaks up with Christine, Luther has his heart broken once again by Marion and lots of other interesting things pop up.

After two successful seasons the third one one really kicks into gear.
""Coach"" has never been shy of downplaying the comedy in favor of some drama and this season has some very dramatic moments, especially when Hayden and Christine break up. It's a credit to Craig T. Nelson and Shelley Fabares how well they balance their comic performances with dramatic outbursts.

But laughter is not far away and this season has some outstanding episodes. ""Magnificent Abscession"" is a personal favorite, that's the one where Hayden has some dental work done at the same time there's a major game going on and he let's Luther take charge. It's a total winner and there's a lot more of those on this season.

On hand with great support is Jerry Van Dyke and Bill Fagerbakke as the unbeatable team of assistants Luther Van Dam and Dauber Dybinski. They can make almost anything seem funny and their input is a big part of why ""Coach"" was successful for nine seasons.

Now I just wish Universal would get off their lazy behinds and release these seasons at a quicker pace. I remember lots more of good ""Coach"" moments from the time this aired on TV and I'd like that trip down memory lane before I'm an old man.",1221436800,3,1675,4.60738255033557
3271412,5,B000Z27H8Q,"I purchased coach the first, second and third season and they are all without exception great. I can't wait until some one has the 4th, 5th and 6th season offered so I can purchase those also.",1221004800,,192,4.361111111111111
3271413,5,B000Z27H8Q,Coach was a very funny situation comedy (imaginative writing is severely lacking in TV comedy today).  Coach was clever and a great casting of Jerry Van Dyke and Craig Nelson.,1214697600,4,175,4.833333333333333
