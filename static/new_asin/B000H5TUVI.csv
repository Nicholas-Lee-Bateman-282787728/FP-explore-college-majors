8293117,5,B000H5TUVI,"I enjoyed Fiddlin' Man: The Life and Times of Bob Wills immensely. The black & white footage & soundtrack captured what it was like to be at a concert or dancehall during their performances, as well as give short vignette insight into some of his players. It pulls no punches & presents Bob & his crew fairly & with care & grace. I highly recommend it for any Bob Wills buff.",1496016000,,375,4.295774647887324
