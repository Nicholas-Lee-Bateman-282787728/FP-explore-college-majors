8125325,5,B000FP2P9Y,This is an artpiece recommended to those ones willing to take a closer look inside Lagos in Nigeria. I saw this movie inside the Sao Paulo International Bienalle of Arts.,1392508800,,170,4.7
8125326,4,B000FP2P9Y,"If you're a fan of Koolhas or themes related to population growth, urban environments & developing countries, you should pick this up.  It can be a little heady & dense at times.  The format of the dvd cuts back and forth from Koolhas engaged in a panel discussion interspersed with scenes of Lagos, including minimal interviews from those native to the city.  I started watching and had to put it down because my head was full.  Watch with objectivity, although Koolhaas' views are intriguing and persuasive they may not be the total answer.

Nonetheless a great educational supplement on a wide range of themes.",1271203200,,613,4.855769230769231
8125327,5,B000FP2P9Y,"Amazing, astonishing, unbeleivable documentary. Great film about work, life, urbanism, trafic in Lagos, so far away from us, almost a different planet.",1211414400,,151,5.909090909090909
8125328,2,B000FP2P9Y,"Very good introduction, but full of architectural jargon.  What Koolhaas learns about the complex internal organization of this city is not unique to Lagos: one finds similar systems in large African and Indian and Chinese cities, for instance. Also, there is no discussion of the complex organization within the city and its relationship to social organization within the larger Nigerian or West African culture, and within its tribal culture, which are highly structured, organized, and ascribe very complex attributes of identity (family, village, kinship groups, etc.) to each person. In short, even here, there are complex systems of ordering.  This film also tends to be soft on the huge crime problem in Lagos, on police brutality and corruption, on the absence of social services for the very poor and ill, educational opportunities for the ordinary or poorest, and the film definitely avoids interviewing the poorest people --- those who are just standing around, waiting on the street, or what not.  The camera records these people, but the interviews are primarily with people of higher status. In one long scene, a group of women paw through huge stacks of irons (for ironing clothes), making numerous selections and putting them in smaller jumbled piles.  It is unclear what they are doing, how they will use the irons they are selecting.  There is no interview, no conversation with these women.  This is so typical of this film.  I found it intelligent and a good introduction to this mega-City, but somewhat naive in its familiarity with other such cities around the world, and very distanced from the realities of the very poorest people who are the majority of a city like Lagos.  The film made me realize how unfamiliar Koolhaas is, really, with the new mega-cities around the world and with the human plight in these complex and hugely difficult human environments.  I found his fundamental stance significantly removed from the larger human condition and very much lost in intellectual generalization.  By the way, I think he is a brilliant guy and a great architect.",1210291200,16,2088,5.096774193548387
