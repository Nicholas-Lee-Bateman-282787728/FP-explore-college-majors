804478,5,6304160267,"i recently took this video out of my library and watched it. i thought that it captured the book very well. sure it did leave out a few characters, but wasn't this video made for tv? because then they probably left situations out (like the easter service part) for time. the acting overall was very good, but there were some times when the actors/actresses got annoying. i thought it was a great adaption of a great book.",992044800,7,421,4.48051948051948
804479,1,6304160267,"Well, let's just say it could be a whole lot better! They cut and change much from the original story, you'll constantly being doing a Double-take. The acting was decent, but let's call this movie a flop, disgracing the  book. If you read the book, and want to see how badly the messed up the  movie, be my guest, but don't say I didn't warn you. Just try and resist  the urge to throw things at Leslie..",955497600,5,404,4.220779220779221
7864263,3,6304160267,"As a teacher, I have read this book numerous times in my classes. I have taken to showing both this TV movie version as well as the theatrical Disney version after the book is read to give the students two different visual interpretations of the book. Also to compare the differences/similarities between the two films. This version is okay. You can tell it was made for TV as the acting and visual components are not of the best qualities. However, overall the movie is enjoyable. Also. as a slight side personal note, I enjoy this movie in part as well because I always had a crush on Annette O'Toole when I was younger.",1486425600,,622,4.513274336283186
7864264,3,6304160267,"One of the nice parts of this film is that it is simpler and has fewer special effects than the more current version. At points, the stages of grief I think are expressed well. However, there are quite a few parts that are left out from the novel and I do not think the acting is as good of quality as the more current film. This is a shorter film than the more current rendition.",1469318400,,380,4.08
7864265,3,6304160267,"Basic story of outcast sixth graders bonding, learning and teaching what life is about. The Disney's and Director: Gabor Csupo's version is trying to be more than the book and came up with an artsy film that is better than most of the trash that we feed our kids today. The only problem is that the professional artsy people can do it better and the people that go for mindless graphics and fairy tail endings will not appreciate this film; it is sort of pearls before swine.

Trying to be subtle, we get nether graphics enough to make this a moppet movie or the lack of graphic making this a philological escapist story. The images are not confined to Terabithia but to Jess (Josh Hutcherson) himself. Of course Zooey Deschanel can bring out the graphics in any of us; be sure to see her again in ""The Tin Man.""

Bottom line a fairly good formula movie but not designed for the mindless. And there is nothing exceptional or surprising. When Val Lawton had to use titles like ""I walked with a Zombie"" and made it into a physiological thriller, Csupo snuck a physiologic thriller right under Disney's nose.",1410480000,,1105,4.575757575757576

7864267,5,6304160267,I received this in a very timely manner.  I bought this for my daughter's birthday and put it away for her.  She has seen this movie many times and wanted her own copy of it......the dvd was in good condition and she will enjoy her very own copy.  Thanks again.,1364601600,,261,4.18
7864268,4,6304160267,"My co-teacher and I used this book as a tool for compare and contrast.  FIRST we read the book and took notes on each chapter.  We purchased the 1985 version to use as our 1st compare/contrast model, we have also pre-ordered the 2007 version and will be using it when it arrives to make a book/movie-movie/movie diagram.  Our students enjoyed the 1985 version.  It stayed true to the book and was originally released by PBS so it IS very appropriate for young audiences.  I also agree that research was a key factor in choosing this story.  The 1985 version is NOT rated.",1173744000,3,571,4.549019607843137
7864269,2,6304160267,"When I discovered that a movie was produced that was based on Patterson's book, Bridge to Terabithia, I was very interested in viewing it.  After seeing the movie, I was extremely disappointed in the film version.  I felt that it did not develop the characters, plot, and theme to the point that Patterson had.

In the novel, Patterson does an excellent job of describing the main characters, Jess and Leslie.  We discover their insecurities, likes and dislikes, and their family situations.  Although the film does make it apparent that the two become best friends, Patterson has a way of showing you why they needed each other.  Jess, coming from a family of having only sisters and demanding parents, needed an outlet and Leslie, being an only child with extremely progressive parents, needed Jess as a social peer.  Patterson also explains how much Jess's life improves from meeting and building a friendship with Leslie, by becoming more confident and caring.  The film does not cover that metamorphosis to the same degree.

Major scenes in the book have been severely shortchanged or even omitted in the movie.  The strong opening where Jess is determined to be the fastest runner in the fifth grade is represented in a poor manner.  The poignant moment where Jess builds a bridge to Terabithia, which is where the title of the book comes from, doesn't even exist in the film version!  Jess's guilt from going to the art museum is lightly mentioned, but never clarified.  Also, the lack of development with scenes involving key supporting roles, really affects the overall message in the story.

The two major themes of Patterson's book are friendship and loss.  By not defining seasons in the film, the viewer is not fully aware of how long Leslie and Jess are friends.  It does not give the idea that the two of them have developed such a strong bond that they would do anything for each other.  The actors portraying the role were not convincing as to what their characters were truly feeling during critical moments in the story.

Once the credits began to roll on the television screen, I was left with the feeling that one of my most beloved books had been misrepresented.  This is definitely a case where the quality of the book far exceeds that of the movie in all aspects.",1106352000,30,2287,4.788265306122449
7864270,3,6304160267,"I insist on this novel every spring with my Grade 5 students - a perfect book for reading aloud - jewel-like prose, great messages, palpable relationships. I'm grateful this film exists, since we get a good chance to compare such adaptations with originals. Both kid actors are adequate, often quite natural, occasionally stilted. A strong sense of poignancy never quite evolves, however. Or poverty. Or personal conflict...I'd suggest a lush, more developed remake, motion-picture length, which includes scenes and characters not explored in this version. It would become sacred to English teachers across this continent. Just like the newest Secret Garden, or Narnia, perhaps.",1080777600,13,678,5.528846153846154
7864271,3,6304160267,"As an elementary school teacher, I read Bridge to Terabithia with my class every year.  It's the best core-lit book in our school.  The video is pretty good for a TV movie.  The acting performances approximate the characters pretty well.  It could easily been a lot better with the addition of a classroom teacher character.  Combining the teacher Jess loves with the one he can't stand was a bad move.  Still. I enjoy showing the movie after reading the book.  As we say in Spanish, Mejor que nada!",1017100800,16,499,4.6022727272727275
