8589522,1,B0014H4GRG,"This was a first rate series and I would love to be able to re-watch it.
However,at these prices I never will.
For me to purchase all 17 of the 50 minute episodes on DVD it would cost me nearly $600 Australian dollars!!!
At a time when nearly every great documentary series, no matter how long is readily available for well under $100, how can the producers justify charging $20 for a single 50 minute episode?
Give away the rights and let someone else make this excellent series available at a reasonable price",1421884800,,511,4.505376344086022
8589523,3,B0014H4GRG,This DVD should be selling for 50% of the price paid. That's why there are only three stars. It's way over priced. This opinion goes for the entire series.,1365465600,,155,4.379310344827586
8589524,3,B0014H4GRG,"This is a WONDERFUL series, but be aware this is not the ORIGINAL version. This is the MILLENNIUM version (1999), with new footage and, obviously, original footage edited out. THAT is the big disappointment! I wanted the original version as it was first broadcast. I was quite disappointed that I was not made aware of this before I made the purchase. Amazon should have had someone check this out (or, at least, done some research), as with all products. That being said, it's still one of the best aviation series available. On a good note, Richard Todd does the narration for the new footage, as he did in the first edition. But, I must continue the search...

Also, this does NOT run 60 minutes, it is 51 minutes.",1336003200,2,717,4.6015625
