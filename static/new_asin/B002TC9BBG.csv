8380020,5,B002TC9BBG,What do I need to become a substance abuse counselor? I live in California,1442707200,,74,4.357142857142857
8380021,5,B002TC9BBG,"I am a recovery coach, clean almost 3 years and I work in the rehab that I went through (3 times). I had the facility that I work for buy this DVD so I would have another tool in my arsenal for step study groups and I am glad I did. The residents really enjoy this material as do I in NA's literature it states that the Ultimate Weapon in recovery is the recovering addict, I believe that. Thanks Mr. Chapman for your take on the 12 steps.

8380022,5,B002TC9BBG,"as a substance abuse counselor with almost 13 years of experience, I am constantly looking for educational materials to give clients who are suffering from chemical dependence.  The well known ""12 steps"" of recovery (which began in 1935 and are found in the book Alcoholics Anonymous) I have found to be the best method to sustain a person in long-term recovery.

Joseph Chapman's video presentation of the 12 steps was just what I was looking for.  In 55 minutes, he covers all 12 steps, explaining each one by one and how they work together for the person in recovery to enable him/her to stay sober.  His clear, down-to-earth and informative style is very helpful in understanding the material.
