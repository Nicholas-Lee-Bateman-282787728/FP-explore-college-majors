6680184,5,B00NU2NM0U,"I've seen all 3 of these, and they're filled with facts, and are beautifully filmed, with awesome images of the subject matter! Spike Psarris is clear and logical throughout. He gives dozens of reasons why the atheistic models of origins simply don't work! I've seen hundreds (literally) of programs on creation science, and his are among the very best!",1457308800,6,353,5.0
6680185,5,B00NU2NM0U,"I love these videos, using them for a homeschool science class, super informative",1456963200,2,81,5.3076923076923075
6680186,1,B00NU2NM0U,"To say that it was painful to watch these DVD's is an understatement! The guy making the presentations in these DVD's is monotone and will put you to sleep. His so called ""proof"" that evolution is wrong and God's creation is right as it comes to how our universe was created falls way short of actually proving anything. It was a total waste of money to get! However, if you are VERY religious, get the set.",1456444800,3,407,4.368421052631579
6680187,5,B00NU2NM0U,These are amazing!,1433808000,2,18,5.333333333333333
6680188,5,B00NU2NM0U,Absolutely Incredible!!! The whole family will love it!!,1415836800,5,56,6.125
6680189,5,B00NU2NM0U,"Another set of outstanding videos that refute the lunacy of evolution and the ""big bang"".  ""I'm so very intelligent -- I don't believe in God.  I believe in a universe that popped out of an infinitely small point that expanded into everything we see today.""  Yeah, right!!",1489017600,,272,4.74468085106383
6680190,5,B00NU2NM0U,"This is my second purchase of this set.  My kids love these DVDs.  I grew up in the 80s and this type of information was just not available back then.  So, this second set is for the grandparents - so they can know not only of the amazing things God has created BUT ALSO how those creations fit perfectly into what we know about science.",1482364800,,337,4.153846153846154
6680191,5,B00NU2NM0U,Spike Psarris has performed a very necessary work.,1481846400,2,50,5.375
6680192,5,B00NU2NM0U,"I used these in conjunction with my son's homeschool science program.  They were very lengthy, lots of facts.
Great to watch in 30 minute segments for students. My 13 year old son loves astronomy and gravitational pull/magnetism so this is perfect for a student with the same interests.",1480896000,,286,4.958333333333333
6680193,5,B00NU2NM0U,I love this series.  Spike does a great job of explaining things that we are finding out about our solar system that absolutely defy the Darwinian Evolution theory.,1480809600,,164,4.857142857142857
6680194,4,B00NU2NM0U,"In the first video, he needs to remember that as a christian, we love sinners, though we might hate the sin.  The material, though, is so good that if he did a remake on it, I would buy it.",1475971200,,189,3.8461538461538463
6680195,5,B00NU2NM0U,I loved them. They were amazing and beautiful! Very well done and informative!,1469318400,,78,5.076923076923077
6680196,5,B00NU2NM0U,Such wonderful and enlightening documentaries.,1468454400,,46,8.4
6680197,5,B00NU2NM0U,"This series is done by real scientists and exposes common myths. Highly educational. Doesn't matter if you're religious or not, science is science.",1466380800,2,147,5.434782608695652
6680198,5,B00NU2NM0U,"I bought the set of 3 videos and have thoroughly enjoyed them. The computer animations and photos are excellent and Spike Psarris' narration is clear and concise. If you are interested in the science of the universe these videos will be eye opening. The ""big Bang"" model obviously does not comply with the laws of physics and relies too much on faith when it cannot supply a scientific fact based explanation. I consider myself and open minded person who wants to know both sides of the issue. These videos present the untold other side of the argument.",1463184000,7,553,4.711340206185567
8680234,5,B00NU2NM0U,"Love this set!  Instead of trying to prove Creation Science, this set does prove it by DISproving evolution!  With quite the sense of humor in spots, he talks about the ""science"" that doesn't show its own faults!  For example, if the ""big bang"" were true, the laws of angular momentum would have all of the planets spinning in the same direction:  but they're not!  The evolutionists are leaving that out!  Watch these to see what else they are not telling us!",1532304000,,460,4.617283950617284
8680235,1,B00NU2NM0U,This is fake news,1522108800,,17,3.5
8680236,5,B00NU2NM0U,"Should be kept on the same shelf as Electric Universe by Tom Findlay, and Plasma Universe. Debunks the antiquated myth of Newtonia gravity as the binding force holding our solar system (and all others) and our universe together. It effectively debunks the current myths of science, astronomy, and cosmology and the need to invent such fantasies as the Oort Cloud, black holds, dark energy, and dark matter. Our universe is a plasma universe and electromagnetic energy, which is 10 x 36 zeros more powerful than gravity, is the binding force that holds it all together.

Excellent DVD series.",1521072000,,591,5.030612244897959
8680237,5,B00NU2NM0U,Absolutely amazing! I love how Spike only uses peer-reviewed work from mainstream science to make all of his points. You can't claim his sources are biased in his favor.,1519603200,,169,4.862068965517241
8680238,5,B00NU2NM0U,Very informative!  Great resource for anyone interested in astronomy!,1508976000,,69,6.666666666666667
8680239,5,B00NU2NM0U,"GREAT WORK, Spike...!  I am buying a couple MORE sets to give as gifts. (Can't wait to see the ""follow-ups"" as well.) This is the sort of information our schools ought to be MANDATED to present (counterpoise to C.S.'s ""Cosmos""), instead of the common-core K-R-4-P stuff shoved down our kids' throats by the progressive-liberal left (their ree-ligion of evolution...)",1501027200,,366,5.203389830508475
8680240,4,B00NU2NM0U,Accomplished much of what the series has set out to do...  Though there are still unanswered questions (stated they are yet to be answered in future volumes of this video series).,1497916800,,179,4.774193548387097
8680241,5,B00NU2NM0U,Excellent!!!! Great movie.,1495497600,,26,8.0
8680242,5,B00NU2NM0U,"These videos present what 'believers' in evolution always state they want: SCIENTIFIC evidence. They show scientifically the farce of evolution and show what a tragic deception it really is. Even you don't believe the Bible, believing evolution is silly. There is too much ORDER in the universe to explain away and NO scientific PROOF that evolution happened over billions of years. Quite the contrary. Evolution is an unprovable ""theory."" Certainly not proven science. You might not be able to ""prove"" the Bible's explanation for the origin of the universe, but it sure makes more sense. These videos demonstrate that. Scientifically.
I'll stay with this:  The heavens declare the glory of God.",1492905600,,695,5.261261261261262
8680243,5,B00NU2NM0U,Wonderful DVDs !!!,1491523200,,18,5.333333333333333
