8179073,5,B000NKI6RG,"Joe Maiden is an incredibly knowledgeable gardener and a natural teacher.  His Yorkshire accent is wonderfully fun.  So often people with garden shows or garden blogs tend to rehash the same set of ideas over and over.  Many of Joe's ideas come from entirely different angles, though, and have clearly been learned over many years of loving plants.  He's not afraid to show his enthusiasm for almost every plant he nurtures, which is great.

The description on this listing is unclear, though.  The picture shows only one of Joe's DVD's, Annuals and Perennials.  Is this listing for all 6 DVD's, or only 2, as it says later?  Why aren't the different titles listed?",1241308800,,665,4.823008849557522
