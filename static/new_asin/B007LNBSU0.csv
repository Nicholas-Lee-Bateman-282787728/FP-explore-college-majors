8519397,1,B007LNBSU0,"For those with hearing impairment, beware that none of the Stratford Collection releases have subtitles or closed-captioning. This is a serious omission that prohibits me from buying these DVDs.",1376265600,6,194,5.724137931034483
8519398,5,B007LNBSU0,"This was a gift for a close friend who loves Henry VIII.  She said the production is fantastic and has watched it a number of times.  If you like Shakespeare and Henry VIII, you will love this.",1361232000,6,193,4.1891891891891895
8519399,4,B007LNBSU0,This DVA of Shakespear's last historical play is not so much an independant film as a record of a production at London's Globe. As such it places the view in the position of a member of the audience viewing the play. As a record of a live performance upon the stage it has the strengths and weaknesses of such a format. Enjoyable but limited.,1344902400,9,342,4.359375
8519400,5,B007LNBSU0,"Exceptional performances, well-directed. The play is essentially a series of elaborate pageants surrounding two or three fantastic scenes: Catherine of Aragon at the legatine court, Wolsey's lament after he loses power, Buckingham's farewell to life before his execution, Henry's first meeting with Anne Boleyn. The pageantry is gorgeous, and the performances exceptional from all of the leads.",1344297600,15,394,5.9298245614035086
8519401,3,B007LNBSU0,"Sound and Video quality not up to the task.
McNiece is almost unintelligible....
Costumes were BIG on the cod pieces, but little else.",1341014400,3,134,4.869565217391305
