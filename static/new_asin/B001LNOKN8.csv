8319185,3,B001LNOKN8,"Called a British companionpiece to ""The Celluloid Closet,"" which was based on Vito Russo's book of the same name, telling the story, mainly in clips from the films, the story of the treatment of gay characters in movies from 1895 to c. 1992---""A Bit of Scarlet"" falls way short.

If you had seen all, or nearly all, of the movies ""A Bit of Scarlet"" shows you clips of, you might get a kick out of it. Alas, I had only seen 13-14 (and I say, chaps, how did you let ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" get away from you?). There are NO titles under the clips, nor are there dates, nor are the clips shown in chronological order, nor are they shown in the order in which all their names appear (rather speedily) at the end of the movie. ) Ian McKellen's wonderful voice sometimes speaks in the present tense, sometimes in the past tense---this follows no chronological order either.

When I saw ""The Celluloid Closet,"" it took me about a month to spend $200 on the movies I had seen clips of and did not yet own. What's more, the film told a sort of a story, which ""A Bit of Scarlet"" does not. One of the reasons I thought of ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" is that ""The Celluloid Clposet"" ends with an appeal that sometime soon, movies with important gay characters will not have to be ""gay"" movies--but simply mix gay characters with straight characters. The way life does, if you happen to live in the right place, like Berkeley, California. And no, I'm not saying nobody is in a closet, or a half-opened closet anymore...but some places in this favored land, there are fewer than there were.

Andrea Weiss uses a lot of Lesbian clips (very few of which came from movies I had seen), and some of which I would very much like to see...if I could only identify them!

Aside from the non-educational aspect in the identification department, the director has a habit of switching from one clip to another, and then immediately back to the first clip again, or on to a third...which destroys the clips' continuity. This, as I said, would be GREAT if I had seen all the movies, understood all the insider jokes, and could immediately straighten everything out in my mind. Alas, I have not, etc.

Something I think I did learn: America is a much more violent country than England. There were at most two dead bodies in ""Scarlet,"" (although suicide is mentioned as being one of a few similar necessary endings for a same-sex affair)---whereas in American movies, especially in the '60s, if not '70s, people were hanging themselves, cutting their throats, being thrown out of cars...and I have a particularly vivid memory of a male transvestite being shot full of holes against a bathroom wall, and leaving a lot of blood on the wall as he sank to the floor.

However, I don't think we have topped ""Victim."" ""The Naked Civil Servant"" ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday""  ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" ""The Jewel in the Crown,"" ""Wilde,"" ""Maurice,"" or ""The Crying Game"" even with our best efforts. So I'll shut up. Um...I should also offer three cheers for the film's using clips from ""Staircase,"" an EXCELLENT film, which everyone laughs at because two of the biggest heterosexual sex symbols play an old, poor gay couple. Viewers don't notice---how well they play them! ""Beautiful old stick....""",1278028800,3,3254,4.678321678321678
8319186,5,B001LNOKN8,"Andrea Weiss has produced an extremely entertaining and empowering documentary of the queer side of British film history which compliments The Celluloid Closet beautifully (they were both works in progress at the same time).

I recently remastered the recording of my half hour interview with Andrea from 1st August 1997, for Queer Radio on 4ZZZfm, when she was invited by the Brisbane International Film Festival to present ""A Bit Of Scarlet"". Andrea was enthusiastic and deservedly proud of this feature. However she was shocked when the projectionist showed the last few reels out of order. I'm over the moon that A Bit Of Scarlet is now available on DVD - I want to see A Bit Of Scarlet in its entirety exactly as Andrea intended.

Wonderful, stylish, inventive, historically unique and truly vital documentary film-making. Highly recommended.",1261958400,2,847,5.175182481751825
