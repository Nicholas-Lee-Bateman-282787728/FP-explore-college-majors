8298951,1,B001EN71CC,"Keep away from this Timeless release if you have fond memories of this show. It has been butchered beyond belief!
I would imagine that if the original negative copies still existed they would probably have a runtime of 26 or more minutes, and as an adventure show of this type, were probably very tightly plotted to begin with. Unfortunately it appears that successive bouts of editing over the years to fit it in increasing amounts of advertising have left copies so heavily edited that they are annoying to watch. To be fair, it appears that the epsodes have been edited in such a way so as to leave as much continuity to the plot as possible, but this still does not alter the fact that the editing leaves the stories far from intact. I have not seen copies of some of these episodes fom other distributors such as Alpha, but one can only hope that that are in better shape than these.",1287273600,4,888,4.487654320987654
8298952,2,B001EN71CC,"The film was a little grainy, but after 50 years it is great this is still around. I was corny I realize how much the world has changed since this was on TV. I rate it at 2.5 out of 5 just okay.",1278806400,,194,3.5348837209302326
8298953,4,B001EN71CC,"Television's first decade represented a wonderful era for adventure shows, especially those developed for youthful audiences.  While American TV production companies offered plenty of action in the way of westerns like ""The Roy Rogers Show"" and ""The Lone Ranger,"" England was churning out costume adventure series like ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and ""William Tell.""  There were also a handful of continental European shows that were produced for the American syndication market, like ""Flash Gordon"" (Germany/France) and ""Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion"" which was originally produced in Morocco and, later, in Italy.  The common denominator in almost all of these series was a heroic ""good guy"" who dealt with all manner of bad guys and desperados.  The ""good guy"" in the appropriately named ""Captain Gallant"" was former movie Tarzan and Flash Gordon serial star Buster Crabbe, who was in his late forties at the time of this production.  Co-starring in the series were B-movie veteran ""Fuzzy"" Knight and Crabbe's real life son Cullen ""Cuffy"" Crabbe.  Depending on the episode, the bad guys were either Arabs or Caucasians.  Although the series was produced with the cooperation of the French Foreign Legion, it was made at a time when the Foreign Legion's presence in North Africa was declining.  In fact, while season 1 episodes were filmed in Morocco, the show's production company departed Morocco after the first season due to the changing political climate there.

There has been comparatively little in the way of commercial DVD releases of this series for baby boomers that grew up watching this series during the 1950s and, in some TV markets, during the early 1960s.  Alpha Video released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Gallant-of-the-Foreign-Legion-Vol-1/dp/B000784XDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Gallant-of-the-Foreign-Legion-Vol-2/dp/B000784XE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion, Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;and the defunct Cascadia Entertainment released a four episode disc that some Amazon marketplace sellers may still have available.  So this 2-disc, 10-episode release from the Timeless Media Group is a welcome addition to the comparatively few episodes that have been released commercially to date.  There are four episodes that are duplicated on this set and the other releases, but the inclusion of six ""new to DVD"" episodes makes this essential for anyone collecting episodes from the series.  The episodes included in this set are:

1. As Long as There Are Arabs
2. Prayer Rug
3. Revenge (duplicated on Alpha, vol. 2)
4. Carnival In Zagora
5. Dagger of Judah
6. Boy Who Found Christmas (duplicated on Alpha, vol. 2)
7. Rodeo
8. Dr. Legionnaire (duplicated on Alpha, vol. 1 and Cascadia)
9. The Long Night (duplicated on Cascadia)
10. Lady from Zagora

As is the case with releases of public domain material, none of these episodes are restored, but all are watchable.  If you own ""Captain Gallant"" episodes from the other releasing companies, these are certainly comparable.

Little seen since it went off the air waves and with a comparatively few episodes available on DVD, this release from Timeless Media is an essential release of the series and is recommended to those interested in vintage action & adventure television shows from the 1950s, as well as fans of Buster Crabbe.",1226448000,19,3529,5.717017208413002
