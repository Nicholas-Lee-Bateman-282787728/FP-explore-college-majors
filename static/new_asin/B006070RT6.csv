4911896,4,B006070RT6,"In all fairness, I am torn about this entire review.  I agree with everyone that the Buddies direct to dvd franchise is strained and borderline pathetic.  And I was ready to completely dislike the movie before even watching it.  But to my chagrin by the third time my six year old played the disc, I found myself chuckling at some of the lines and antics.

Yes, the CGI is bad. The ""Middle Eastern accents"" are bad. The humor is bad and at times completely unnecessary (when Cammy and Butter Ball discuss regurgitation... YUCK! While a fact of life, was this important enough to put in the movie?!?!). And the premise of the movie?  ... you guessed it, bad.  For anyone put off by the supernatural storyline in Spooky Buddies, Treasure Buddies is no different as there is a curse involved and an evil cat bent on taking over the world (think Warner Brother's ""Cats & Dogs"" movies).  Yes there are scary scenes because of whole storyline, but the amount of 'fright' really depends on your child's age and maturity level.  There are also other mature themes like the sale of camels (ie: animal rights), and grave robbing.  On the flip side, there are definitely cultural aspects present such as prayer and specific Egyptian foods - and your child will probably have questions about all of this as mine did.  While the movie is G-rated, I'd say 5+ is a good range.

What really helped redeem the movie was the acting.  Yes, I said acting!  Edward Hermann (recognizible from reruns of The Gilmore Girls and on voiceover work on various programs on the Biography Channel as well as a slew of movies) and Richard Riehle (a character actor who played Santa Claus in the 'Search for Santa Paws' - the buddy-less direct to dvd Buddy movie). These two obviously enjoyed hamming it up and getting into their over the top 'old man adventurer' roles.  Plus, they had more screen time than the Buddies! And I confess, I LOVE Uncle Babi!  I know, I know - a monkey for comic relief is as old as that black and white Laurel and Hardy mummy movie, but this monkey offered up some decent gags. Who knew another Disney monkey could take on Aladdin's Abu???

The bonus features are basic: the ""Roam"" 'music video' (basically, karaoke for 2nd tier Disney Channel actors), B-Dog's episode of ""cribs"", and the ever present ""upgrade to blu-ray"" commercials.  To wrap up, my six year old would probably give this five stars.  So with my input, I'm settling with a solid 3.5 star rating.

Did I mention I **LOVE** Uncle Babi?  ;)",1328400000,14,2503,4.619909502262443
4911897,3,B006070RT6,"My kids were really excited for this one, and it did look like a promising kid friendly Indiana Jones adventure flick starring the Buddies.  It was originally supposed to be released around Easter of 2011 but was shoved back almost a year.  Since my kids enjoyed it, I am glad they did release it, but it is by no means a good movie.

The plot is trite and ridiculous.  Of course, having puppies searching for treasure in forgotten tombs is not going to be a logical movie, but some of the things that happened were just ridiculous.  The main kid's Grandpa trips over one of the most important clues in an oasis.  Apparently he had spent his life looking for this thing and it's just right there in this tiny oasis under a few inches of sand.  The traps in the actual tomb should have been interesting, but were not.  Anyone could have made it through with ease.  Of course the humans didn't know this at first, and come across one trap.  It would make sense for adventuring Grandpa to go first and risk himself, or one of the bad guy's lackeys but instead they encourage the young grandson to do it.  This was just ridiculous.  Even my daughters pointed out how mean they were for risking the grandson's life in this way.  Nothing happens to him, but still. As for the ending... I'm sure the museum they are trying to save is about to tank since it's main exhibit has fallen due to theft.  This was supposed to be a funny end note involving the monkey that narrates this tale, but makes the whole debacle feel rather flat.

Technically it is also a disaster, with terrible CGI all around.  The animals mouth movements do not look natural, nor as good as in previous movies.  However the worst are the cat statues that come to life in the tombs.  They are not difficult to animate, being flat, relatively smooth statues (no crazy fur effects needed) but are done stiffly and poorly.  They look like CGI from a late 90s video game.  Just pathetic.

Boring and trite without any of the humor of other movies in the series, it is no wonder Treasure Buddies ended up on a straight to DVD route.  As boring as this was, I'm still giving it three stars.  Why?  Because my kids enjoyed the movie, and have watched it multiple times since we bought it.  They like it... for the most part it is innocent ""fun"", and really if the kids enjoy it, that's all that matters.

If you are considering this as your first leap into the world of the Buddies, ""Space Buddies"" or ""Snow Buddies"" are better movies to start out on.",1328400000,4,2507,4.419213973799127
4911898,5,B006070RT6,"My daughter (5) and I (43) had a great time watching this movie.  It had some fun new characters (a cheeky little monkey and a friendly camel) to complement the five lovable Buddies and our fairly high expectations (we have seen all the Buddies movies) were more than satisfied.  The humor and adventure were handled in an appropriate manner for a G rated movie and had some genuine laugh-out-loud moments.  The middle-eastern setting was an exciting and interesting departure for the pups and held our interest to the final frame.  While the actors involved will never be receiving Academy Awards for their performances, the movie showcased positive values in a way that kids can relate to.  I am certain that it will be receiving a considerable amount of repeat viewings in our house.",1328313600,17,786,4.879699248120301
4911899,2,B006070RT6,"My children anxiously awaited the arrival of this movie in the mail.  However, we were quite disappointed as we watched it tonight.  My youngest daughter kept saying that the voice of one of the buddies is different than in the other movies.  My youngest son kept saying, ""I'm scared"".  At the end of the movie, they all three said they were too scared to go to bed and asked to please watch something else for a few minutes to get their minds off of this movie.

Please understand, this movie is not SO TERRIBLY SCARY.  There are some creepy scenes, especially with the naked cat, the snake, the bugs, the naked cat...oh did I already mention the naked cat?  I think one problem is that my children enjoy the Air Bud and Buddies movies because they make them laugh (as silly as they may be).  This movie does not make children laugh and it almost put mom and dad to sleep!

There is also an element of family bonding, love, and loyalty in the Air Bud movies that is missing in some of the Buddies movies.  It makes quite a difference.

I'm giving this two stars instead of one because the description of one star is ""I hate it"".  I don't hate this movie, but none of us have a desire to see it again.  Therefore, the two stars which means ""I don't like it"".",1328227200,22,1258,4.302127659574468

But if you have illisions that Disney still makes movies fun for the whole family, then don't pick this one - it will pop that bubble.  The writing is the worst I have ever seen, and the acting was horrible.  The plot was so canned it was predictable at every turn.  I have seen better third grade plays done at the local grade school.  I am hoping to hide this one so I do not have to even hear the background again......

All have been great so far. Airbuddies, Snowbuddies, Spacebuddies, Santabuddies, Spookybuddies and Treasurebuddies.

I can't wait to see what comes out next. Some people claim this film is 'scary' to little kids. I find this a bit odd. The 'naked' cat is a real cat breed. And the snake isn't that bad.

Today he watched Treasure Buddies for the first time and said it is scary and there are a lot of ""really weird parts"".  Such as a dog starts to turn into a cat and a cat turns into a statue. He thinks he is going to have nightmares tonight.  When I started this review I read the descriptions for each of the ratings (one star, two star) and he picked one star ""I hate it"".

I said we could put it away until he is older (we have done that with other ones) but he said he doesn't even want to keep it--that we have to get rid of it.

The adventure setting in Egypt searching for an ancient treasure, and working through a variety of magical protections to find it, also provided some new visual interest. Although there were scary moments, it didn't seem a problem for my kids, and there's no death (as there is Disney films like Lion King, which we recently watched) so overall it seemed fine for this age group.

4912099,4,B006070RT6,"My daughter is 3.5 and got hooked on the buddy movies over Christmas with Santa Buddies.  She saw the ads for this movie on Disney channel and I bought it for our family movie night.  I would say it is a kids version of Indiana Jones, where they are seeking treasure in a hidden location.  The hairless cat is interesting but did not come anywhere near scaring my daughter.  There is some cultural influence, although not entirely accurate, good enough for kids to get an idea, rose bud wears a head piece and butterball discusses the food.  My daughter was a little scared of the snake, but was fine after the buddies got past it and was a far cry from giving her nightmares or preventing her from going to bed after we viewed it.  Overall the movie was cute, and she is looking forward to watching it again, so clearly it did not have a lasting fear impression on her.  I would agree with other viewers that it does not have as much screen time with the buddies as Santa Buddies did, but I viewed that as necessary for plot development.  For scare comparison, my daughter hated the lady at the orphanage on Santa Paws, to the point that we only watched that movie once, she asked this morning if we could watch this movie again at our next movie night  I think that says it all about the ""fear"" factor of this movie.  The ""suspenseful"" parts of this movie are comparable to any other disney movie.

4912101,2,B006070RT6,"After viewing TREASURE BUDDIES, one thing is clear:  you can only take so much cuteness.  Disney really needs to let this franchise go.  I think even kids don't find the pups that interesting anymore?  Even the addition of Babi the monkey doesn't help much since his cuteness wears thin.  I know--I'm just a grumpy old coot but still an avid movie fan who likes an entertaining family film.  After all, we're the ones who buy them!
I generally enjoy Richard Riehle and Edward Hermann, but their characters and dialogue are just poorly written.  The dog voice characterizations are generic and uninspired and interchangeable.  Adding CGI effects to the black demon cats is embarrassingly bad.  Kids today are more cognizant of good effects thanks to Harry Potter and Captain Jack.  The ""buddies"" may have seemed lucrative at the time but enough is enough.  An animated run on Nickelodeon might be more practical.",1329091200,,911,4.966887417218543

8490139,4,B006070RT6,"Like most of the ""Buddies"" movies it's cheesy.  Somewhat cute but, cheesy.  There's some heavy stereotyping... like for example they Enter Egypt without going through the Egypttian Airport in Cairo and instead land in the middle of the desert with no customs checks and simple looking natives wearing fashions from last century or older.  When they show Egypt in modern times so why is the fictional town of Bastasti made to look like a village from the late 18th century?  Dirt floors, dirt roads, no modern clothing, simple construction, no real shops just an outdoor souk with simple stalls.  Even in the small villages Ive been to there are towering apartment complexes made of modern cement construction.  Almost all the streets are paved, there would be modern style storefronts, stalls would not be ancient wood and canvas construction, etc..., Rosebud given a scarf which resembles Barbra Eden's costuming in I Dream of Genie more than anything people would wear in the actual Middle East or North Africa.  There are many aspects of the film which are stereotypical representations of North African/Egyptian life but all of it is also based in the 17th-18th century.

I understand that much of this is meant to mimic common elements of archeology movies like Indiana Jones (which although taking place much earlier still portrayed many of the same problematic issues) but it doesn't change the fact that such things influence how our children (the main intended audience) will then perceive this area of the world.  It's no wonder that in this day and age so many Westerners ask me and my half Egyptian kids questions like ""Does Egypt have air conditioning?"", ""Does everyone have a camel?"", ""Does everyone live in a tent in the desert?""

On the positive side it did show some positive semi accurate representations of Bedoiun culture and life.  Some of the women's costuming is semi-accurate.  I very much enjoyed seeing the few seconds of dance which were not entirely innacurate.  The music was totally off and not Bedoiun, instead they chose to go with sterotypical Ancient Egyptian-esque sounds.

Overall, despite all it's flaws and stereotyping I enjoyed watching it with my kids, they seemed to love it, especially my youngest who just loves puppies.  If your kids are 8 or under and like puppies they will almost certainly enjoy this movie.",1527120000,,2355,5.0025641025641026
