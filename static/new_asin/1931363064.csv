7801469,3,1931363064,Learning the Voodooo Shield alone is worth getting this dvd. It can easily be added to any system and used instantly. Can definately save you some dental work. Pretty well rounded dvd.,1324339200,,184,4.78125
7801470,1,1931363064,"The production values of these two tapes are more ""home video"" than instructional.  They are more to demonstrate Tom Proctor's Tao Chi Do techniques than to teach any kind of useful or practicle defensive or offensive techniques.
The techniques demonstrated are minimal with no follow-up.  Attempting to use them ""on the street"" is likely to cause you a lot of grief.  His advice to RUN is the best defensive tactic on the tapes.
The tapes are interesting to watch, given the above caveat, but are definately not worth the price.",991440000,5,529,4.855555555555555
7801471,4,1931363064,"Tom Proctor is a great instructor in self-defense and ""going for the win"". In his videos he shows how to handle certain situations and common approaches that hostile individuals may use in trying to beat you up, or just beat you.  I have all of his videos and he shows how certain moves work and sometimes how to even beat them...but not many people are very well diciplined in Tao Chi Do, which is what he primarily teaches. I have used his techniques in my police training and many of my opponents are caught off guard, since they have never seen such an approach to fighting.  I am really glad that I purchased his videos.",985564800,3,625,4.426086956521739
