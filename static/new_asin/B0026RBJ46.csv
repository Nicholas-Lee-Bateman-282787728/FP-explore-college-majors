8353474,4,B0026RBJ46,"""Bildersturm: Iconoclast Part II - The Visual Resistance"" comes packed with stuff for HSB-fans.

The first DVD, ""Joel"", contains a full concert from Summer Breeze, running about an hour long. The audio hits hard, and there are plenty of cameras to cover the action. The audience was kept at their toes that night, including two ""Walls Of Death"".

On the same disc you get a documentary that's just over an hour in length (it's completely in German but English subtitles are included), showing the real people in the band expressing their own thoughts and living out their own lives - you'll get to see their jobs, how they record and practice, and learn just how meticulous and caring guys they all are. They're animal and people-lovers, vegan, anti-nazi and anti-fascist. Nice to see. The documentary is visually fascinating as well, and ends with some nice bloopers. It's definitely not just your average band sit-down session.

Included on the first disc are also four music videos.

The second DVD, ""Amarthius"", contains an even longer concert shot in Wienna, and even though it contains virtually the same songs (albeit in different order), it's still one hell of a show. Again, Eric (or Marcus, who really knows?) keeps the crowd alive and divides them into a ""Wall Of Death"". Both video and sound quality hold up well, even though the camera seems a bit more frantic at times and the sound just a tad more ""distant"" - turn it up and play it on a big screen and it'll rock your entire household though. There are optional subtitles for what Eric says in and inbetween songs, for those of us who aren't fluent in German yet. They're small and flash by quickly though, so be ready to read.

Included is also a ""making of Wienna""-featurette, which is basically a montage of the show being set up and prepared for. It runs for about six minutes.

There are also some mixed bonus features on the second disc (sadly none of which are subtitled), the first being ""Metal Cooking"", which is the main part of the band (Eric/Marcus not included) cooking some food. Not the most common extra, but without knowing what's said, it's basically just a German home video of cooking. There are two ""studio diaries"", one from Europe and one from the U.S (which I felt there was no sense in watching without subtitles). ""Backstage and more"" is the same thing, a montage of the guys in the band while not on stage. ""Osnabrck 2008 - Live Medley"" is not quite what it sounds like, just a short video demonstrating that they were in Osnabrck and did a live medley on a small stage.
To finish things off, there's an ""Online band practice"", showing the band members (with the screen split into five) practicing a few complete songs unplugged (with Eric ""whispering"" the vocals). This is a pretty interesting way to see the band mellowed-out, and might be a little bit helpful for anyone practicing their songs on an instrument.",1249862400,3,2907,4.723865877712032
