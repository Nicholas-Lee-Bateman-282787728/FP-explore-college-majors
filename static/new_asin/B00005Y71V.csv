1675081,5,B00005Y71V,"After owning the VHS of this movie for over five years, and having watched it several times I am really beginning to appreciate the narrative structure of the movie.  It just flows well.  The amount of ideas expressed in a mere 58 minutes is gargantuan.  This is about the best overview of Campbell's overall teaching that I know of (and I have an extensive JC collection).  The best parts of the movie are the footage of actual interaction between Campbell and his students (who were often his teachers in other aspects).  George Lucas says in the movie that as wonderful as Campbell's books are, they just don't capture the essence of the man.  This is the biggest understatement it the movie.  This was a wonderful, wonderful man, a genius.  Even in death, he remains a role model in an age without them.

I did know until later that Campbell had died before the series aired.  Through that series I became fascinated with his writings and read his books.

1675100,5,B00005Y71V,"""The Hero's Journey"" is more than just a stuffy biography of Joseph Campbell (1904-1987.) We see alive prorate with much of it illustrated by Joseph Campbell himself.

While we are in the process of viewing Campbell's discoveries we make a few discoveries our self. We see a different view of God and our relationship through today's myths.

If you are not familiar with his work he deals a lot in explaining similarities in mythologies, religions, and story lines across many different cultures and regions. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves mythology, fantasy, history, or literature as he combines all three into an intricately woven tale in which you will see how all of humanity is connected in a collective subconscious. The Hero's Journey primary focuses on the reoccurring archetype of the hero and what makes a hero.

First, I thought it would be an in depth discussion of ""The Hero's Journey"". which is a truly important concept in my view.  When I determined that it was more biographical (I should have paid more attention to the description), I settled in for learning more about the man.  Although there were some interesting biographical scenes, the movie lacked focus as it bounced around between early years, an award ceremony, and lectures/seminars with student groups.  I would have been happy with an in depth biographical study, or a concentration on the ideas in the seminars.  A much better DVD is Finding Joe, an exquisite analysis of his ideas.",1347753600,22,728,4.738095238095238

1675165,4,B00005Y71V,"It's a documentary, it's a biography, it's an intimate glimpse into one of the most fascinating scholars of the 20th century.  I am aware of the Hero's Journey as a primary form of myth. So I wanted to see what Joseph Campbell, whose work has impressed me a great deal, had to say about it.

Well, he has a lot, but the producer of the documentary also has a lot to say, effectively weaving Campbell's own biography into the mythological pattern, as if to say that Campbell is himself one such hero. And it does fit, because Campbell points out that the central point to all these stories is what comes from within the individual that is itself sacred, and not external forces or forms.

Using images from a great many traditions, starting with Native Americans when he was just a boy, Campbell makes a convincing case for the commonality of basic mythical truths throughout the world, through many centuries. Yes, he includes Judeo-Christian mythology. But he tells the tale of a radio interview where the interviewer made it clear he had no idea what myth is, and probably had no definition of the term metaphor at all. When pressed to provide an example, he did what many people do, and provide an example of a simile instead. Campbell said he felt bad for having demolished this young man before his live radio audience, but still manages to get across the fact that a myth or metaphor is neither a lie nor a truth. It is something which represents a truth, but not directly.

Campbell ranged far and wide in his studies, and he takes us on much the same journey in this hour-long documentary. From Native American, he moves to Arthurian legends, which were the subject of his studies abroad in the 1920s. Thence to Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian mythology, keeping always to the point that mythology is not subject to the true/false standards of historical writing, but an understanding of the metaphorical and allegorical aspects.

Some of the best sequences are when Campbell is telling mythological stories to his students, including an explanation of their symbolism, their value to those who passed them down through their tribe, and so on. He's quite a teacher by anyone's standard.",1336953600,5,2193,4.775725593667546
1675166,4,B00005Y71V,"This documentary was made shortly before Joseph Campbell's death and is a nice mix of biographical and academic material. That said, it's really only an introduction to both.

Unfortunately there are still the ones like ""Diogeneze""(a bit further down), who out of fear believe that reality can be grasped by a set of dogmas, and despise someone like Campbell, who tries to look deeper than that and get to the core of the conditions for our existence.",1258848000,5,714,4.5859375

1675172,5,B00005Y71V,"On this dvd Campbell explains about the argument he had with a radio show host as to whether a metaphor is a myth or a lie.

This is one of the more interesting Campbell dvd's I have watched. This documentary follows JC's own life story in the context of his classic work 'The Hero with a thousand faces.'

How his early interest in Indian Culture and their stories eventually crisscrossed with other cultures, his early Christian upbringing and moving away from that to discover the stories from other cultures, and spiritual systems, and get a more global perspective.

In particular he references a chance meeting with Indian philosopher Krishnamurti on an Atlantic crossing, when K gave him a book about the Buddha, which illumined some commonalites with his Indian folklore studies.  Eventually he discerned the common patterns of all mythology, and the story of the hero who gets the call to adventure, refuses the call, and then is compelled to take the adventure and commit to it. He also mentions Carl Jung's influence on his work.

If you are like me, you would have to watch several times to get the most out of it.

Interesting to note the influence he had on George Lucas, who used HWTF as a template for Star Wars.  George Lucas pays tribute to Campbell, and there is plenty of footage from Star Wars to ilustrate the steps of the Hero's Journey.

If you are interested in storytelling, mythology or writing,  I highly recommend this dvd for your consideration.  I know I will be making some notes for my own records.",1208995200,14,1531,4.7218045112781954

1675185,5,B00005Y71V,"I am a reflective person by nature, I believe that most people are, I just think that for the most part, a lot of us have gotten sidetracked. Instead of facing our issues and our challenges we face the television and we escape our pain by watching the pains that others are going through...Anna Nicole...Brittney Spears...and I've heard a lot of people comment on these two women...they're ""nuts"", ""freaks"", they ""have everything but don't even know it..."" but I see these women as symbols for where we are as a culture; lost, sad, empty...

This documentary reminds me in such a brilliant way that we really are on a journey. That each one of us has a role to play out and that is to learn how to be the ""star"" of our own production. Most of us have not learned how to do this. Most of us think that life just happens and we have to deal with what life gives us. But nothing can happen to us, until it happens ""through"" us...through our own perceptions, our own attitudes, our own beliefs about it. Most of us profess to believing in some kind of Higher Power and yet we are afraid to admit that this Higher Power is within us...that we are, in Truth, expressions of this Higher Power.

Joseph Campbell would be the first to admit that for the most part, most of us are not afraid of our darkness, our shadows, our fears...what we are most afraid of is our brilliance, our light, our beauty. There is no devil outside of us waiting to ""snatch"" our souls, we steal from ourselves every time we think we are ""miserable sinners"" rather than extensions of the Divine.

We are literally in the dark about who we truly are. Anna Nicole was. Brittney Spears is. Most of us are. We are not our bodies. We are not these personalities or these behaviors or any of these things that we typically identify with in the physical world. We will not change anything in our life through hate. In fact, hating certain things will only bring these things about more frequently. We must instead yield to the Light, surrender to Love, be willing to use our Lives in way that serve, bless, and heal the whole world. We must learn to trust our own heart, be guided by our own soul, be lead by our own Light. Don't let yourself become hypnotized or seduced by power ""out there""...the true power, the only power...is right where you are...you are your own savior, you are your own hero. Your human life is symbolic for something greater. The only reason why there are shadows in your life is because you are standing in your own Light.

I highly recommend anything by Campbell. His wisdom and his gentle humor can cut through years of accumulated ""junk"". Campbell truly followed his own advice, he lived his ""bliss"". His passion, his dedication to Truth, his willingness to shine all shows up in this DVD. He truly was a ""godsend"" just as you are...just as I am...just as we all are...

Let your Light shine today.

Peace & Blessings.",1172880000,119,2910,4.481132075471698
1675186,4,B00005Y71V,"Although this film covers some areas of Joseph Campbell's knowledge, it does not even begin to show his true genius. It very loosely covers all that Campbell worked so long and so hard to accomplish. But if one were looking for a very short overview of Campbell's work, this would be it.

In the film, Campbell goes deeply into only a few certain areas that he has covered. He talks about how the three major religions put emphasis on the hero's trials. He talks about Jesus Christ and His three temptations. He talks about Buddha and his might. He uses these as examples to prove his point, and it is well received.

If you are wishing to get a full understanding of Joseph Campbell just by watching this movie, you are going to be sorely disappointed. However, it is some amazing footage of one of the most ingenious men of our time. Campbell talks of things that would never occur to the normal human being unless brought to our attention. If you have been interested in myth before, but did not know where to start, this film is great for beginners.",1098144000,19,1053,4.507853403141361
1675187,3,B00005Y71V,"""The Hero's Adventure"" is drawn from Joseph Campbell's study of mythology.  Joseph Campbell is one of the world's foremost authorities of mythology, which really makes the movie interesting because of his ability to tie mythology in with the every day events of people's lives.  He presents the idea that a hero or heroine is not just a person that commits a supernatural act, but that we can find a hero or a heroine all around us in different shapes and forms.  Joseph presents a hero as someone who has given his life to something bigger than himself or other than himself.  According to Joseph Campbell, the moral objective of heroism is saving a person or idea.  Also, all heroes must go through trials and tribulations in order to complete the serendipitous task asked of them.  They must also under-go a near death experience.

Joseph Campbell's ability to tie in the hero's path with other things, Star Wars for example, helps to provide a relationship from the movie to the viewer.  I think the Star Wars movies are very interesting and to know that they are based around Joseph Campbell's hero's path helps me to make a connection with the movie.  In one of the Star Wars videos, there is a scene where three of the people are stuck in a trash compactor, which is very much like a belly of the whale experience, or a near death experience.  The hero's act includes a departure, a fulfillment, and a return.  The Star Wars trilogy goes through all three of these acts.  Which indicates that the Star Wars videos are based on this type of hero mythology.

In other ways, however, this movie is also uninspiring as Joseph Campbell sometimes makes it seem that he is reaching in order to tie in mythology to everything in every day life.  Sometimes mythology can be tied in, and other times, it can't.  Overall, it was an okay movie.  It wasn't life changing, but it was an informative movie and very educational.",1098144000,19,1919,4.649851632047477
1675188,5,B00005Y71V,"This visual look at the energetic scholar of literature and religion captures his infectious high spirits nicely. Campbell has fun with his material, which is--contrary to the critcism of Diogenes-the-reviewer--of real substance and depth. It's not the easy syncretism of rebellious adolescent dabblers in Eastern religion: it's mature, creative thinking by a deeply read scholar, and if you're just goofing off with ""spirituality,"" like much of today's pop New Age devotees, you feel quickly out of your depth with this stuff. Any writer or tradition he raises for discussion, he is steeped in. Show me shallowness, Diogenes, in his discussions of Joyce or Schopenhauer, Buddhism or Christianity. Having a vast range to one's education, doesn't automatically mean one's understanding is spread thin. Let this look at a great mind and spirit inspire you, prospective Campbellians,to serious look at his work.",1090800000,17,908,5.492857142857143
1675189,5,B00005Y71V,"The previous reviewer, 'diogeneze' as he likes to call him/serself, is an idiot him/herself, for a lack of understanding the profundity of Campbell's words.
One needs to look far beyond the spoken words to gather their meaning. Diogeneze quoted Shakespeare in the comment, but one wonders if he/she really even understands him!",1087084800,9,327,5.3076923076923075
1675190,1,B00005Y71V,"After all the shouting has died down, the truth is that Campbell's work looks great - as long as you're sufficiently young at heart that you cannot see how shallow his ideas are.
This is a classic example of Western-style religious rebellion, especially in the 1950s and 60s - rejecting one's own traditions in favour of sanitised, homogenised, exotic Eastern teachings.  It is romantic, defiant, and ultimately vacuous.  Yet for many people, especially, perhaps, those with above average intellect, a flirtation with Campbell's work may be a necessary stage in their development - a part of their own ""hero's journey"".
Though fun while it lasts, like all of Campbell's writing there is nothing here of any lasting substance.  As Shakespeare so eloquently put it:
""It is a tale, told by an idiot,
Full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.""
It just takes some people longer than others to spot Emperor Campbell's nakedness.",1075161600,20,924,5.065789473684211
1675191,5,B00005Y71V,"The class screening of this video was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. Campbell offers extraordinary insight into the human condition through meticulous analysis of mythology from all over the world. I found it very interesting that George Lucas's films were inspired by mythology. One can delve into all sorts of modern films and find situational, character, and symbolic archetypes that occurred in ancient mythology. Joseph Campbell possesses one of the most zealously inquisitive minds on this planet, and he proves it in this video. This does not deserve to be called a simple ""video"". It was an experience which will never be reproduced by another film company as long as man roams the earth.
 Campbell has many interesting philosophies. One of these ideas which he portrayed in the video was that human beings should listen to the inner-voice. In this sense, we can all be dissenters (or mavericks). Joseph Campbell was a maverick of sorts until his tragic death in 1987. We could learn a lot about the art of being a maverick from this brave, intelligent man. He devoted his entire life to studying mythology, with little regard to what others thought of this practice. Campbell states in the video that every society can be evaluated to an enormous degree simply by examining what kind of stories and myths were created in said society. Also, one can see how similar all societies in the world are. Many of Campbell's statements relate to Carl Jung's theory of the collective unconscious. Frequent occurrences in mythology throughout the world show that all people might have similar basic thought processes.
 The only aspect of the video that was not up to par was the interviewing style. I and a number of the other viewers felt that it was weak and not hard-hitting enough. However, the overall video was a masterpiece. I was thoroughly impressed by this pristine work of art. Joseph Campbell was a God among ants, and his contributions to society shall be remembered forever more.",1063929600,59,2011,4.946745562130178
1675192,3,B00005Y71V,"In The Power of Myth: The Hero's Adventure (Volume One), Bill Moyers, the show's host, interviews Joseph Campbell, the father of modern myth. The interview is set on George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch in Northern California. The reason for this seemingly random setting is one of the main themes in the movie, which is how George Lucas's Star Wars movies can relate to myths of old. The movie involves many various clips from the three original Star Wars movies (Episode IV: A New Hope, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi) that depict certain aspects of myths being described in the interview. I think it is very interesting the way that the Star Wars movies are tied right into the interview and how the clips are shown along the way. Joseph Campbell does a very well job describing the myths he told about in the interview and telling how they relate to the Star Wars Clips. I believe this movie is a very complete portrayal of myths that can be a real learning experience for someone new to the world of mythology and even someone learned in the ways of myths. This movie is a bit slow at times, but a powerful movie nonetheless. I would recommend it to an older crowd, just because of the deep and intellectual level of the movie.",1062979200,9,1270,4.550218340611353
