6775706,5,B00OWHZ94E,"This show stressed me the hell out, and I enjoyed the hell out of it.  At times it was funny, at times it was weepy, other times, I was trying to will more fully justified crotch punching!

It is so rare to find actual romance anime, and this one is certainly one.  Plus, the supporting cast is great, especially Nana-senpai.  And, I really thought the ending was going to be crushing, but it ended very satisfactorily.

Highly recommend.  Exorcist!",1434412800,6,449,4.620253164556962
6775707,5,B00OWHZ94E,"I love this anime, it's not for everyone, but it is great in my opinion. As a 20-year-old male, I enjoy a good romance, and this hit the spot, sure there are flaws and bland drama, but it is enjoyable. This collection is pretty standard, the best quality available. I just wish it was released as one instead of two parts. This was a great addition to my collection, no complaints from me! You get what is described. ",1432857600,2,417,4.346153846153846

8685187,5,B00OWHZ94E,"I actually do not like too many romance stories but I liked this one because of the comedy and eventually liked the whole story itself. There are a lot of discrepancies with the way some characters behave, like there is a guy who likes one girl, but after he is dumped but said girl he finds he likes another one and forgets every feeling he had for the other girl, and while there are times in real life that things like that happen, you usually don't forget about that girl you confessed to and pretend that you are buddies after that, which is what they end up doing like the main female character
 who initially goes after one guy but ends up with another guy because, reasons.and totally forgets her love for the other guy

There will be a lot of things that will probably won't make any sense to you but if you don't care about normal logic in anime, like myself, then you will enjoy the pace of this Comedy, Romance, and some drama  anime",1507161600,,945,4.327683615819209
