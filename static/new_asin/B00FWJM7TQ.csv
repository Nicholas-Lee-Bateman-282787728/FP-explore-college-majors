8618896,4,B00FWJM7TQ,"There is no question that when it has came down to what Spongebob Squarepants has delivered, al the way back to 1999 it is absolute hilarious and funny laughter for so many generations. Hard to believe that the Nickelodeon cartoon is celebrating 15 years of absolute joy and wonderment. But it isn't just Spongebob who has the laughs alone, his friends also have brought out some really great moments. The best case in point is Patrick Star, Spongebob's closest friend. Not only has he been fun to watch, but he makes things that look dumb and gullible, more adorable and full of laughter for all. There is no question the best things can be just as funny as is years ago, and Patrick is still no exception. But for the first time ever, Patrick finally has a DVD of favorite episodes for die hard Spongebob fans to call his own.

Spongebob & Friends: Patrick Squarepants showcases 14 of Spongebob's funniest escapades with Patrick being the star, and the funny hero overall. The cartoons are absolute funny from beginning to end, and continue to show just why his shortness of intelligence is worth watching. Each episode is absolutely classic and funny, and consists of fan favorites of Spongebob like That's No Lady, where Patrick thinks a traveling salesman who sells vacations, is a gangster, and Spongebob dresses him up as a lady to protect him from leaving Bikini Bottom, and The Googly Artiste which Patrick's love of arts and crafts with Spongebob painting googly eyes on rocks is looked upon for fame, and New Student Starfish where  Patrick tags along with Spongebob to boating school, only to be the class clown and get Spongebob in trouble. The shorts are absolutely funny and bring out the kid in anyone who has been into Spongebob Squarepants for years. Watching these shorts still deliver laughs each and every time, and still bring out the kid in me ever since Spongebob came out.

Overall, I absolutely recommend Patrick Squarepants, not just because the cartoons are funny, but the sidekicks make better laughter at times to match with the star character, and in this case Patrick is absolutely the star to match with Spongebob's eyes. While Spongebob has had his best moments with others like Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs and Plankton, the ones that will always come first and funniest will be the ones he has had with his best friend Patrick. I absolutely recommend this DVD for die hard Spongebob Squarepants fans, and anyone who is new to the Spongebob universe under the sea in Bikini Bottom.

I wish it was like Season 8 where the credits are the end of each disc when played all is selected.. but overall, recommend.",1392508800,,252,4.270833333333333
