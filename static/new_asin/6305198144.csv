987857,2,6305198144,"Kooky fun - I'm sure considered scandalous and decadent upon first release but now a kooky time capsule glimpse at what was considered shocking and depraved 40+ years ago. It is a much more realistic look at teens on break than the ""beach"" movies from the US starring Frankie Avalon. Keep in mind this is the EXACT SAME movie as SWEET VIOLENCE. Difference is SWEET ECSTASY is dubbed with a soft, 4:3 and haggard print while SWEET VIOLENCE is subtitled, widescreen and a pristine print. So, most film fanatics will prefer the SWEET VIOLENCE's transfer to DVD even though it's in French.",1251417600,15,585,4.745098039215686

987859,4,6305198144,"Just to watch a very young, sexy Elke Sommer with her pouting lips makes Sweet Ecstasy worthwhile.  The dramatics of Elke's exploitative character  as a swinger on the French Riveria is interesting and charming. For most of  the movie, Elke Sommer prances about in a skimpy top and revealing  hip-hugger pants that enhances her animalistic sexuality.  The real kicker  that makes Sweet Ecstasy so sweet, however, is the love scene with Elke on  the deck of the yacht.  Elke absolutely sizzles in a very hot, very real,  and very graphic display of young torrid love.  This is a must own video.",966988800,37,593,4.782178217821782
