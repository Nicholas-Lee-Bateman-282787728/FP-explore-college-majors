8541837,4,B009IF13X6,"Precocious is an apt term when applied to Gioachino Rossini. By age 16 he had finished setting to music a draft sent piece-meal by a member of the Mombelli family. The father Dominico Mombelli was a noted tenor with two daughters, Ester and Anna; the first a fine mezzo and the other a contralto (he had also adopted a bass) so they formed a vocal quartet. They met young Rossini when he was 12 and began sending him arias and sections with words written by the wife Vinsenzina for him to set to music. By 1808 when Rossini was 16 he had completed the score sent to him. A few arias and the opening sinfonia were penned by Mrs Mombelli. The family gave several local concerts using it and then in 1812 with added parts gave a first professional performance of the revised opera at the Teatro Valle in Rome on May 18. It was a great success. Though this was Rossini's first opera composition (dramma serio) it was his third professional staging as by then he had already staged two comic operas (farsa comica) in 1810 and 1811.
The story and its development hark back to the 18th century ""opera seria"" of Metastacio and the operas of that genre written by Mozart. Demetrius king of Syria (tenor) has been forced by court intrigue to entrust his son Demetrio, under the name of Siveno (contralto) to the court of Polibio (bass) king of Parthia. Polibio has a daughter Lisinga (mezzo) who becomes the beloved of the young Demetrio under the name of Siveno.
The intrigue in Syria has been settled and Demetrio wants his son back but Polibio doesn't want him to leave. etc. etc.etc. It all ends with the son Demetrio (Siveno) staying in Parthia with his lady-love Lisinga.
The singers in this production are all excellent. Mirco Palazzi, the bass as father Polibio has much to sing and a most pleasant voice. He has mastered the Rossini style bel canto very well. Yijie Shi is the tenor King of Syria - Demetrius. He is supposed to be unpleasant and Shi's hard voice conveys that. He is an excellent vocalist and did well in a recent recording of Donizetti's ""La Favorite"". As the trouser-role  Siveno  (King of Syria's son) Victoria Zaytseva did well with the music she had. ""Questa cor ti giura amore"" a duet with Lisinga is one of the most beautiful sections of music in the opera.
The best vocal writing of the opera is for Lisinga  and Maria Jose Moreno is up to it. She is amazing at vocal dexterity and  throws off those roulades lilting along effortlessly. Brava!
The quality of the music varies (some of it written by the librettist) but the second act quartet ""Donami omai Siveno"" is truly outstanding. Subsequently Rossini used it in several other composition as was his wont.
The production of ""Demetrio e Polibio"" is a challenge for any director. As written there is little action and really is a series of arias strung together loosely forming a story. So Davide Livermore was quite inventive in having the tale unfold as ghosts that come out at night when the theater is closed. So the ghosts prance around the darkened backstage, dressing rooms catwalk etc. But even the ghosts have ghosts a kind of""doppelganger""ghost that can carry candles or sit on a piano (but doesn't sing) It is fun!
All in all it is a most enjoyable endeavor and the music is a treasure worth many listenings.",1444262400,,3294,4.606473594548552

8541839,5,B009IF13X6,"This is a simple plot, composed by Rossini in his early teens, and I agree with the lead reviewer that the music smacks of late Mozart in abundance.
The plot about paternal love and filial piety may sound a bit `old-fashioned', so the director Livermore devised some gimmicks, that almost tripped the performance over but for the outstanding conductor Rovaris and four superb young soloists who deserves the highest accolade.
The sets have nothing to do with Syria or Persia, though the two title roles were meant to be the rulers of those two kingdoms according to the plot.  The staging is in Rossini's period, and if the audience concentrate on the period-costumed figures on stage, you would not go wrong, even though there are `foils' of the four singers and lots of mirrors that sometimes work, and sometimes don't.
As the Persian ruler, the young Italian basso Mirco Palazzi has a beautiful voice, and performs outstandingly despite his very youthful look.  Another very young singer Victoria Zaytseva sang the trousered role of Siveno, the `son' of both kings. The vocal demands are not really great, but what amazes is her beauty of tone and fully alive performance. Soprano Maria Jos Moreno as Publio's daughter Lisinga had to tackle the fiendishly demanding vocal role, and by and large, especially in the outer Act, her singing is simply spectacular. It is in the final Act and Scene that there are a couple of tight top notes, but still pitch perfect.
The tenor role of Demetrio is the focal point of the entire opera. Here, young Chinese tenor Shi Yijie (or Yijie Shi) tackles the role with full vocal assurance and dramatic conviction. While Shi's voice may not suit the full lyrical repertoire such as Verdi, Puccini et al, in Rossini and Mozart he has already proved himself to be a very competent interpretor.
It is heartening to see such wonderful young talents emerging in the operatic scene as the `quartet' in this early Rossinian opera revival.",1382918400,,1967,4.86865671641791
8541840,4,B009IF13X6,"IT IS A FIRST OPERA EVER WRITTEN BY Rossini, IT'S LIKE Mozart's OR Verdi's OR wAGNER, JUST A BEGINNING. tHIS T IME, IT IS DONE WELL, VERY WELL, TO BEGIN WITH CORRADO ROVARIS CONDUCTING IT, AND SINGERS THAT ARE SATISFACTORY OR MORE THAN SATISFACTORY. It is a pleasant opera, I think the soprano is first class. I recommend it, with qualifications on Rossini's first opera.",1369440000,,371,4.723076923076923
8541841,4,B009IF13X6,"There's a wonderful double-take moment at the start of this 2010 Rossini Opera Festival production of Rossini's Demetrio e Polibio, which turns out to be a thoughtful way to present the work and at the same time manages to strike the perfect balance between the traditional performance and more modern conceptual. The stage curtain draws back at the opening to reveal a final curtain call of a performer for an unseen audience out the back of the stage. His self-congratulations out of the way, the stage hands having moved the sets to the wings, the scene is set for some ancient 'ghosts of opera past' to arise out of the packing cases to re-enact a historic performance of the drama of Rossini's Demetrio e Polibio.

It's a clever and effective compromise that works well for this one particular Rossini opera that needs a thoughtful and considered approach. Demetrio e Polibio is Rossini's first opera, which he started to compose when he was only 14 years old. The nature of this 'dramma serio' dictates to some extent that it leans more towards the model of composition of the 18th century rather than towards the new Italian opera model of the 19th century that Rossini would play such an important part in establishing. The influence of Mozart is evident in the musical approach in an early La Finta Giardiniera or Apollo et Hyacinthus style, if somewhat less adventurous in arrangements and technique, but it's surprising just how much of the Rossini sound is evident even at this early stage. The arrangements may have been tailor-made for the Mombelli family, but they also work to the advantage of the musical drama, the first act made-up almost entirely of duets, with only the bare minimum of recitative, allowing the bonds to be established between the characters much more effectively than solipsistic arias of emotional turmoil, and it builds up wonderfully towards a couple of skilfully arranged quartets.

Demetrio e Polibio would still however be little more than an early Rossini curiosity, a pleasant but dull and conventional drama, were it not for the wonderful effort put into every aspect of the work for the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, the first stage production of the work in 150 years. As well as evoking the spirit of the Mombelli family through the period costume ghosts that inhabit a modern opera stage and thereby taking the origin of the work into account, director Davide Livermore also uses the haunted stage element to make the opera something wonderful to watch by employing plenty of Illusionist trickery. There's relevance in this as well as entertainment, acknowledging the ""old-style"" theatricality of the work, but also using handheld flames to evoke the sparking of love and anger, while the proliferation of doubles, mirror images and disappearing acts all reflect the shifting identities of the characters. It makes a rather academic work seem much more meaningful and consistently entertaining.

The consideration given towards the presentation of this extremely rare work is also reflected in the delightful performance of the musicians, directed by Corrado Rovaris, and the singing performances. Bearing in mind that the difficulty of the roles as written was determined by the capabilities of the original cast, the singing is good across all the roles. Lisinga has the most challenging singing and Mara Jos Moreno takes in all the high notes - sometimes a little effortfull, but with great expressiveness. Demetrio has the most active role in the work as the villain of the piece (or perceived villain) and Yijie Shi demonstrates a fine Rossinian Italian tenor style that suits the role perfectly. The breeches role of Siveno doesn't have quite so many demands placed on it in terms of singing and mezzo-soprano Victoria Zaytseva is absolutely fine for the part, while Mirco Palazzi's reliable bass fulfils the requirements for Polibio with characteristic Rossinian verve. In terms of duets and ensemble work, the combination of their voices works beautifully in these lovely little arrangements.

On Blu-ray, this is another lovely package of a Rossini Opera Festival production. The High Definition transfer looks superb, and the stage design and direction is so strong that Tiziano Mancini doesn't have to resort to video trickery to make it any more interesting. The usual high quality audio tracks in PCM Stereo and DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 give a detailed account of the fine music and the singing performance, making this curiosity all the more fascinating to listen to. The subtitles are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Korean. The English subtitles have some curiosities of translation - ""No more husband have I, a villain has subtracted him from me"" is one example, but they are mostly fine if a little stiff and literal. As well as some words on the production and a full synopsis in the accompanying booklet, there is a fine 14-minute 'Making Of' with interviews and behind the scenes footage on the disc itself.",1352505600,9,4999,5.055757575757576
