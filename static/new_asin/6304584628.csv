7874349,5,6304584628,"Jon Bon Jovi has a fascinating voice, the fascinating voice of an abyss that attracts you without any remission. It is New York City life. It is the life of any big city. Life comes from no one knows where in places that look like nothing really human, even if they are called maternities, like an asepticized no man's land between anywhere and nowhere, a somewhere that has no depth, no dimension, no density, except that or those of an abysmal chasm in which one falls without knowing when it started and when it will end, without knowing where it will lead since it comes from nowhere. And that voice of Jon Bon Jovi's rocks us gently in our feeling of loss and of abandoned escape that has no destination and no departure. Life is just a vast movement among things and decors more or less peopled with ghosts and strangers whom we cannot feel, to whom we cannot speak and from whom we can get no signifying message. Life is a driverless taxicab that recklessly runs among vehicles and people hitting some now and some more then and running always faster and still without any sense of direction. Our life in a city is like a tot tossed in a trashcan, a promise that may very well never see the sun again after the lid has fallen over its eyes. Can love be saved in this jungle ? Can love save us from this melting asphalt ? Can love redeem the asphalt jungle in which we are trapped ? And is there any escape, even with and in love, that can repave the dirt road in which we are grounded and stuck ? This long clip, this short film does not seem to leave any hope for any soul surviving in this blind alley of city life. And maybe it's better like that. We can always dream a miracle. It has more chances to happen than the city has to salvage itself into human density.

7874351,5,6304584628,"Destination Anywhere, which as a matter of fact is also a full-length LP by the artist Jon Bon Jovi. Get's transfered from the concept of the album to the big screen. The idea behind this film, which works like a long music video is the fact that Jon and his wife, are in mourning over their child who was killed in an accident. As a result, both characters lives are full of confusion, despair and heartache. Jon seems like a lost soul in this film, he still hasn't gotten over the death of his child. As a result he enters a world of depression. His wife, played by Demi Moore is equally as frustrated and confused as Jon. The movie shows their pain and how they are still trying to cope with the loss. I was surprised at just how touching this film was, I was a little teary eyed when it was over. I felt for all the characters, all the characters seemed real to me. Not bad I say for a small little film like this. This film shows the world that Jon Bon Jovi is indeed a great actor, and a multi-talented entertainer. Demi Moore almost steals the show, when on screen she sucks you in with her beauty and her emotions. This is a must see for fans of both actors, especially Bon Jovi fans. I find that this film gives new meaning to Jon's solo LP, Destination Anywhere. I now appreciate it more and understand it better thanks to this film. While a little on the depressing side, Destination Anywhere still manages to be engaging and worthwhile on the strengths of it's focused stars. Also stars Kevin Bacon, Annabella Sciorria, Whoopie Goldberg.",972259200,102,1549,4.400696864111498
7874352,5,6304584628,"it is true... when i first brought destination anywhere home and started watching it, it wasn't exactly what i was expecting.  i thought it was another video cassette with music videos on it.  but what i found had a lot more depth to it.  we all know jon bon jovi as a singer of a rock and roll band.  what the rest of the world needs to see is how much more jon can do.  in my opinion, this video introduced us to the rising star jon is today as an actor.  i think it is one of the best videos jon has released.  i hope you will consider buying it and watching it. i'm glad i did.",971827200,11,581,3.8728813559322033
7874353,5,6304584628,"The tune values the perfection as the movie by the extent which flows casually exactly as a sound track. It is basically a movie of a very dark tone though reverberations relieved because it becomes saving that last is faint are left.  I think it's based on ""August 7, 4:15"", a true story from Paul Korzilius's(Jon's Manager) daughter's (Katherine) murder. The gorgeous co-starring formation seems to have gone out by a no guarantee though it was said the production cost 2,750,000.00 bucks.",970963200,,491,4.987804878048781
7874354,1,6304584628,"I'm a big fan, but this movie was a big dissapointment.  I was suprised because I love all of his other movies.  It was very depressing and boring. Don't waste your money",969840000,,170,4.28125
7874355,5,6304584628,"This video wasn't just for his latest solo album. It was an anology of all the songs and lives that he created throughout the years of recordings. It's the story of Tommy and Gina, it's the next stage from the song  ""Living on a Prayer"" and ""Lie to Me"", it's a personal  note of Jon's own experiences and it's the best video clip that i have ever  watched. He had the BEST crew in, Demi, and Whoopie - such a dag that  women.  A great big thumbs up for something that was different from all the  other stuff they did. I hope that they never regret the risk of it, it  turned out to be fantastic. Recomend it to any Bon Jovi fan.",911865600,8,628,4.056910569105691
