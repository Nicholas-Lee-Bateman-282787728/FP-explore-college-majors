4334764,5,B004DTS182,"This season features Mr. Rogers and Mr. McFeely going bowling, a basketball ep with an Olympic gold medalist Suzy McConnell,a youth soccer team, and a visit to a peanut butter factory.  The show is a favorite of my 2.5 year old.  He wants to skip the ""Land of Make-Believe sections"" (which are often serialized) but is transfixed by Mr. Rogers's sweet and honest dialogue with his neighbors.",1377561600,,391,4.82089552238806

8426164,5,B004DTS182,"Another fantastic program from the best guy ever on TV! My kiddo repeatedly asks to see Mr. Rogers and I am happy to oblige. Mr. Rogers was there for me as a kid and it's fantastic to now revisit him through my children's eyes. This completely holds up today--in fact, I think we need it more than ever--and has excellent values; teaching children to love themselves and each other, while learning about how to understand the world around them.",1492473600,,444,4.632911392405063

8426167,5,B004DTS182,Anything that Mr. Rogers put out is 5 star material.  All of my kids loved him and my youngest (who is now an adult) is disabled and she just adores him.  I hear her laughing every time she turns on one of his programs.,1454976000,,219,3.9545454545454546

8426173,5,B004DTS182,"The best children's show from a developmental standpoint. There's enough repetition of themes without being condescending, the editing isn't over-stimulating, the topics are important and explored in depth, the jazz piano is both interesting and peaceful, and you can tell that Mr. Rogers spent his mornings reading child development literature.",1441324800,,345,5.92
