8305102,5,B001GEFB94,"I initially had my doubts but in the end it turned out to be the kind of instructional i could get behind. Juan Hombre of the Banke Shinobinoden school led by Jinichi Kawakami, is head of the Japan Ninjutsu Federation for a reason. The film teaches the important stretches, the kamae, and what the kamae are used for and how to transition. It isn't Bujinkan, because it keeps everything simple and direct, using shadow tactics, a fine quality of Ninjutsu training. Definitely a keeper I say. I wonder if the Iga Ninjutsu DVD he's planning is just as good.",1349136000,,555,4.616161616161616
8305103,4,B001GEFB94,"well....mr john man...a student yes a student of jinchi kawakami...now the questions is ,is he reenactor student or a ""real"" banke shinobiden ninjutsu student? and is it real?? well i can say a couple things here...its not any other martial art it does look like  some kinda budo and it does look like the stuff that mr kawakami is peddaling...look at the sites nowdays mr man is NOT posing with kawakami sensei but training and holding a scroll of traing givin to him by kawakami..yes this is some kind of ninjutsu folks...wether it made or not it is at least the very least made up ninjutsu from historical japanese source and i have seen worse!!

this is just an insight you do not view it with a open mind or chose to see the techniques as they aren't very well done all the time..then ya it may be crap be there is gold here it wther you chose to watch it and learn...period.
there isn't just one kind of ninjutsu folks thats a fact no one can prove how may or what ninjutsu is truly surviving..period.  but fakers can be seen a mile away,,,there were chinese and korean ""night warriors"" or assassins bu there weren't ""ninja"" its japanese term but there were warrioirs in those countries with similar tacts at the time..",1260403200,2,1225,4.509009009009009
