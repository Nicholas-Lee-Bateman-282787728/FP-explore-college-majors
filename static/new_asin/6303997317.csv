7859470,5,6303997317,"This documentary gives a good look into the Shoah project. The first 15 minutes discusses the project itself. Then there's credits and black screen for a few minutes, but it's not over. The interviews with the survivors makes up the rest of the time. I was confused at first when watching it because the VHS box doesn't explain the two different segments. These are just a sampling of the first interviews the project conducted. There have been thousands more interviewed since this video was released. Their website will tell you more about how to find the rest of the interviews",1481846400,,580,4.81

7859475,5,6303997317,"This sad but powerful video is a must-have for any English or History teacher dealing with the Holocaust.  I *do* agree with many Holocaust survivors who urge teachers to NOT begin their units with such a film, but to use it as a tool that complements a balanced discussion of this horrific time period.  I begin my unit with a study of poems from the book, ""I Never Saw Another Butterfly,"" recommended by another teacher, and then proceed to this video.  Finally, we read the book, ""Night,"" by Elie Wiesel.  I feel all the first-hand accounts really hit home the reality of the time, as well as the need to be wary of recurrences in such hatred today.",1052352000,15,652,4.5
7859476,5,6303997317,"This was an excellent movie...If you are interested in this topic, you should check out the critically acclaimed books of Dorit B. Whiteman  (she is a Holocaust survivor herself as well as a pysychologist): ""The Uprooted"", a classic which insightfully examines how some Jews (including many Kindertransport members) managed to miraculously escape Nazi occupied countries and describes the emotional aftermaths of their ordeals, and the more recent ""Escape Via Siberia"", which tells the dramatic story of a Polish boy who surived exile in Siberia and joined the only Russian Kindertransport.",1041552000,6,590,5.555555555555555

I can think of no work that brings us closer. not even anne frank wich I particulary hate.,973555200,2,321,4.366666666666666
