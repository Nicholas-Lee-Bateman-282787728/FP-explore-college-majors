8041714,1,B0006J280A,"This DVD is of appalling quality in both video and audio. I have a VHS recording that I made from a public television telecast here in Australia in 1997 - and even though the reception was poor, it still looks and sounds noticeably superior to this CineVista DVD (which looks like a second generation VHS recording of a poorly received telecast).

The menu looks little better than what you can do with an average domestic DVR - making it seem even more like a home made pirated product.

I would hesitate to pay $5 for this DVD version - even though I know how good the original documentary is. ""I Am My Own Woman"" deserved to be released with video and audio as close to original quality as possible.",1204588800,3,702,4.434108527131783
