8018029,5,B0001XASDU,a good movie better then the 1st one,1427241600,,36,3.625
8018030,3,B0001XASDU,"it's ok, as long as you don't spend alot of money for it, the good thing about this is that it's 2-in-1, you get the first part as well (Vamps), so be sure to save your money before ordering the first part, the strip club where they dance at, lol, i think i've been there before.
it's a low budget vampire film, the plot is alittle off, but i watched this Vamps2 first before watching the other one. lots of nudity, plus you get a weird little short story about somedude with a toilet from hell.",1362441600,,495,4.166666666666667
8018031,1,B0001XASDU,"Don't waste your time or energy. Even with the incredible Amber Newman, this is a piece of trupe that isn't worth seeing. Pass on it.",1244764800,,133,4.36
8018032,2,B0001XASDU,"Glori-Anne Gilbert is the only good thing in this movie, because of her beautiful appearance. But all in all Blood Sisters: Vamps 2, is a dull boring skin flick, with over the top performances.",1225929600,2,193,4.705882352941177
8018033,2,B0001XASDU,"Wow, I thought this project had been shelved. It was filmed ages ago and I never heard of any kind of release or anything. Glad to see it finally made it out, even though it was a few years ago.

I was an extra in the strip club scenes, but I have no idea how much you see me, if at all. A key point you might see me in is when one of the strippers kills some dude on stage and all the guys in the club scramble for the doors. I had the brilliant idea of slamming some guy to the ground to get him out of my way, making me the second to last guy out. Not sure if that bit made the cut, but if it did, that's me.

I gotta say, I distinctly remember the filming was a bit on the, shall we say, ""lower than low budget"" side, and the acting, well, I'm not sure we can really call it that. It was fun, though.

Just ordered it for about $3 bucks. Can't wait to see if I made it in.",1203206400,2,876,3.6737967914438503
8018034,4,B0001XASDU,Well almost at it's best. This is no Young Frankenstein but still s good way to waste a little time!,1168041600,4,100,4.05
8018035,1,B0001XASDU,"And yes, pun more or less intended. I finally got a copy today, really against my better judgement, but it was cheap (at a store that shall remain nameless) and two discs so I hoped against hope that it'd be a decent deal. Man, was I wrong! If I knew it'd be this bad you couldn't have GIVEN it to me! I expected it to be low budget but jeez, they must've only used about $100 worth of videotape, instead of using film. The 1996 original was the worst in all respects but at least the sequel kinda had a couple of funny jokes. Still, it'd cut back and forth between being on videotape and digital tape, I guess it was. In both films the stripping was so boring that I'd fast forward through it, but at least the dancers were pretty decent looking for the most part. The acting in both films was atrocious, as were the stupidest, phoniest fight scenes ever, and who the hell was in charge of the sucky music? What was up with that? I know that their budget either didn't allow for using at least some popular music, or else they weren't given permission to, I guess, but the songs (which were all vampire-themed, of course) were just soooo bad, musically.

BTW, is it just me or did anyone else notice the similarity between the ex-priest actor and his chubby friend with long dark hair and full facial hair, Larry, and Kevin Smith and his goateed friend in ""Clerks""? Coincidence? You be the judge.

Anyway, if you like fake breasts (though there were some real ones, too), atrocious acting, phony fight scene, gahdawful music and Z-budget films then by all means get this DVD set. It's right up your alley.",1110412800,9,1606,4.422297297297297
8018036,5,B0001XASDU,This movie has everything you could ask for in a vampire movie from a blood bath with a naked Amber Newman to a blood orgasm with Glori-Anne Gilbert.  The strip club scenes had a feel of realism to them.  None of that cheesy feeling the director had never been to a strip club and repeats 30 seconds of footage over and over.  This two disk set also included a short film Portal:the movie that I found hilarious.  One of my favorite parts in the extras is the homage to boobies.  There sure were plenty of them to chose from in this movie.,1092528000,13,539,4.245098039215686
