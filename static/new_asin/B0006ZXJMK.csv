8044293,2,B0006ZXJMK,"I bought this film quite a few years ago in a 3 for $10 sale when Blockbuster was going out of business. I happened to be a martial arts expert and a fan of inde film. I've flirted with the film Industry more off than on and have low level connections so even bad films like this are interesting to me. Chances are I may actually know some of the actors or stunt people etc. First off Jerremy Renner was an unknown when I first acquired this film. The other actors are famous Chinese or Asian charactor actors from films like Big Trouble in Little China. At least 4 or 5 appeared in that film together. I forgotten I had the film til I got bored and dug through my pile and saw it with Renner's name listed. Now of course he's an A list actor with a string of hits from The Hurt Locker to Marvel's The Avengers. I had to watch again to make sure this was the very same Jeremy Renner. He may or may not be a little embarrassed to be associated with this film but it certainly is him. He appears to be in his mid 20s. Set 90s California, playing a drugged out loser with a scheme to to get rich and get away by double crossing a dangerous drug dealer..Bad idea..Renner's charactor and his partner Paul are severely beaten and their bodies are dumped and left for dead. The last of Renner seen in the film. Only Paul survives when discovered by one of the masters of a nearby Buddhist retreat. He's taken there and nursed back to health. In the process is taught Shaolin kungfu and has reformed. Of course he also gets even with the evil druglord that killed his friend and forced his onetime girlfriend into prostitution. The druglord also happens to be a renegade kungfu student of his Shaolin monastary and former protege of his favorite teacher. The actor playing Paul (Adolfo Swaya) is also the writer and director. This seems to be his first film with plenty of mistakes. He couldn't seem to make up his mind if this was to be a comedy or gritty revenge flick. Its weak in both. Its funny when supposed to be serious and the jokes or comedy didn't work at all except one scene when he's told he has to get up at 5:30 in the morning. For some reason I get a laugh out of that. Its part Karate Kid meets Kwai Chang Cain meets Enter the Dragon meets Brandon Lee's Rapid Fire with none of the hot action, flash and sense of direction. All on a shoestring budget.",1419292800,,2361,4.260579064587973
8044294,2,B0006ZXJMK,"Jeremy Renner was the main reason I rented this movie. And his small part in it was not disappointing. It was after his part was done that the movie took a nose dive into the silly to the absurd. Almost to the point that I have to wonder if it's poking fun at kung-fu movies in general, or if it's just that bad.

All in all I'm glad I rented it and didn't purchase it. Usually I'm all for bad movies. I have a nice collection, but this one was so bad that it wouldn't even get hidden in the bottom of the pile of my bad movies. It would be in the dusty far corner under my bed. If not hidden in the paneling to get forgotten.",1381708800,2,626,3.890625
8044295,1,B0006ZXJMK,This movie is awful. I didn't even bother unloading it on some unsuspecting soul .. I just threw it away.,1300579200,3,105,4.3
8044296,1,B0006ZXJMK,"if you're looking for an early jeremy renner film do not bother with ""paper dragons""...he's gone in the first 10 minutes and what follows is just not worth it...great asian icons wasted on crappy material...and to make it even worse? the cinematography is beyond bad, hell it's sometimes out of focus...do not, i repeat, do not buy this film...i tried, really, i honestly tried to watch it from start to finish, but decided to do dishes instead...OUCH!",1273276800,17,452,4.883116883116883
8044297,4,B0006ZXJMK,"I bought this movie for my brother's birthday, at the fine price of $3.99, thinking it was going to be a laugh out loud ""stupid kung-fu"" movie.  Consequently, after watching the movie I was quite impressed with what I watched.

The story is somewhat insipid and recycled; a gang and dirty cops leave a drug dealer for dead.  The dying drug dealer is discovered by a group of Buddhist monks, who happen to know martial arts. I bet you have already guessed the rest, dying drug dealer assimilates the idealism and lifestyles of the monks.  However, is it for revenge or redemption?

There are several actors from ""Big Trouble in Little China"" and some other actors I know I have seen in other movies, but I just can't recall where.  As for the acting itself, it isn't bad, considering it is a lower budget movie.  The fighting is pretty well choreographed and it isn't saturated throughout the movie.  Translation, you don't become desensitize to martial arts after the movie has been on for five minutes.

I can't believe I am saying this too, but there is plenty of dialogue and development of character, which I found very interesting.  The title of the movie even manages to play a pseudo philosophical reference.  As for the picture quality, it is a fair 3 on a scale of 5.  The editing can be a bit distressing at times, but doesn't ruin the movie.  There is also some conflict on where the hell this movie takes place.  At one point in looks like it is taking place in New York City, then LA, next off to the landscape of Japan and finally on the moon of Endor.

Overall, not a bad movie, since I had every intention of laughing my butt off while I was watching it.",1156464000,8,1670,4.465346534653466
