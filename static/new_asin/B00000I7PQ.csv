1219207,5,B00000I7PQ,"This video, 150 minutes long, contains about 50 extracts of the Great pianist playing pieces from almost all the great composers. Also included are extracts from some of his chamber music collaborations with Oistrakh,  Gutman, ... and Richter as accompanist (e.g., Fischer-Dieskau in Schubert  and a fun Wolf's Feuerleiter in practice--with a gimpy Pleyel piano). What  a feast for Richter freaks, and Lovers of Great piano playing. One of the  best Piano video ever. I wish that other great artists could get such  complete coverage, instead of the usual 30-60 minutes of a few pieces in  dry visual setting--CBS--do you hear ?? (I'm a Gould Freak also).",921542400,7,655,5.074766355140187
1219208,5,B00000I7PQ,"I wanted to add a comment to Ed Ting's observation that the ending self-appraisal seemed out of left-field and heartbreaking.
  This was an example of what we call filmmaker's license.
  The context was missing.  Richter was talking about a particular performance others liked and which he didn't.  He didn't like himself in that particular performance, but the film made it seem he was talking about himself in general.

 Now, one could say the filmmaker was trying to make a statement that Richter, whose moods could go up and down, did not at times like himself.  Nevertheless, people go away thinking that he was really saying he didn't like himself, period.  While Monsaingeon may have been hinting at what he considered a basic truth, it is still misleading as people tend to believe Richter really said this about himself specifically.  Not so.
  Nevertheless, this is one of the most gripping documentaries I have ever viewed.  A very rich film.",989712000,21,953,4.949367088607595
1219209,5,B00000I7PQ,"By now most of you have heard about the famous ending of this remarkable film, in which a frail, gaunt, 80 year old Sviatoslav Richter looks into the camera and declares ""I do not like myself.  That's it.""  What's stunning about this statement is that it seems to come out of left field.  Richter talks to the unobtrusive interviewer about his life, jokes around, discusses performances, talks about his contemporaries.  These are intercut with videos of his unparalleled piano playing over the years.  Everything seems fine.
Then, -boom- the admission.  ""I do not like myself.""  The film is silent for a minute or two afterwards, as the slow movement of Schubert's D960 sonata plays in the background.  His eyes take on a blank expression.  Richter puts his head in his hands.  This is heartbreaking to watch.  Then the film ends.
This 2.5 hour documentary was originally produced in two 75 minute parts in France.  The two halves have been joined together (end credits roll after the first section) in an inelegant fashion, which disrupts the viewing experience a bit.  But you won't care.
This is the most remarkable film about music I've seen about music in a long time.  Along with those Famous Last Words, there are a number of great moments in this movie.  Like Benjamin Britten, barely able to contain his glee form playing Mozart's Sonata #10 in a duet with Richter (Britten's smile at the end of the performance is almost worth the price of admission in itself.)  Or seeing Glenn Gould's nutty analysis of Richter's playing.  Or of the numerous contradictions in opinion the film loves to place side by side.  Or hearing the harrowing story about his father's death.
There are other admissions as well.  Haydn was preferred to Mozart.  His favorite Schubert sonata was D 894 in G.  He hated planning and would just as soon announce a concert a day or two in advance.  He had no need for material wealth or common creature comforts (many artists *say* this, but how many of them would sleep happily underneath their teacher's piano night after night?)
This film had one curious side effect on me.  Whenever I see a film or video about piano playing, it makes me practice my own playing a little more.  Heck, even the recent silly Jim Brickman special on PBS got me to sit down a few extra hours.  But after watching this film, which shows one towering, titanic performance after another, I could not bear to even look at my piano for several days.
I mean, after hearing Richter play, what was the point?",980035200,89,2512,4.719540229885057
1219210,5,B00000I7PQ,"The film is in two parts.  The first concentrates on more personal aspects of Richter, and his historical setting, while the second part focuses on his professional life.  In the first, it describes his early life with the piano, his difficult family situation, how his father was murdered, how he met his wife.  Some of the scenes, especially of the piano performance, appear so refined, one feels they are watching a fictional art film about some extravagent character.  Such scenes are interleaved with Richter himself speaking about his life, as an old man.  The second part is more objective and professional.  Richter describes aspects of his professional life after reaching fame.  Such characters as Gould and Rubinstein speak about their impressions of Richter.
The film includes precious footage, not only of Richter's performances, but also of such characters as Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Stalin, Rostropovich, Oistrakh, Fischer-Dieskau, and Karajan.  It is very enjoyable, intellectually and musically stimulating.  It is an essential watch for anyone musical, and will be interesting to anyone even slightly interested in piano.
As the film states, that Richter is one of the greatest pianists of all time no one doubts.  The film ends with Richter stating ""I do not like myself"", and falling into a pose of grief.  A very touching film.",978825600,9,1349,5.257009345794392
1219211,5,B00000I7PQ,"Watching this film is quite an experiance.  First and foremost, there is a cornucopia of concert footage; ear-opening performances of everyone from Schubert to Prokofiev, Haydn to Chopin, seemingly half the classical repetoire in fact.  The legendary technical prowess, depth, and architectonic soundness of his playing are on full display here.  But in addition this is a well-made and moving documentary, directed with intelligence and subtlety.  An emaciated-looking Richter of 80-odd (already ill and close to death) reads from his journals, answers questions and reminisces.  His life unfolds on the screen and we feel we get to know his personality somewhat, his likes and dislikes, idiosyncracies.  Of course he remains an 'enigma'---the taproots of his genius remain obscure as with any other complex human being.  But the idiosyncracies are fascinating.  ""Take a piano like you take fate,"" he says.  When given a choice of pianos, he usually played badly, Richter says, but he played very well on some dreadful pianos.  He was of mixed German-Russian parentage, and it may partly account for his indifference to politics that at various times some Russians claimed he was German, while Germans said he was Russian.  I like the oppositions that Monsaingeon sets up.  For instance, his wife maintains that he practiced 10-12 hours per day.  Cut to Richter: No more than 3 hours per day.  ""Ten hours---nonsense!""  Only if he had to learn a piece on short notice, he maintains.  Again, Richter says that despite the praise, he played badly during his first American tour in 1961; very badly.  Cut to Artur Rubinstein, rhapsodizing about seeing Richter for the first time on that tour: ""It was fabulous! ...A sound of prodigious beauty...It brought tears to my eyes!""  Also, though there was much that was tragic in Richter's life, there's also plenty of footage that indicates that he know how to have a good time, including a screamingly campy sequence of him playing Liszt in the Soviet film The Composer Glinka.  This is a generous, multivalent film that one can get happily lost in.  A great portrait of one of the two or three finest classical pianists of the 20th century.",974160000,34,2183,5.061624649859944
1219212,5,B00000I7PQ,"This video consists of a long interview with the then-80-something year-old Richter, intercut with photos and a lot of film of his live performances. It is truly mesmerizing, and makes the viewer understand why  Richter was the legend that he was. The artistry and virtuosity of the  playing in the film and video clips are extraordinary -- often it's hard to  believe that the film clip wasn't speeded up.",955670400,7,406,4.855072463768116
1219213,4,B00000I7PQ,When will this VHS video be AVAILABLE as DVD (region code 1 US) ? It is available as DVD in Europe (region code 2 - 5).,944438400,12,119,3.6153846153846154
1219214,5,B00000I7PQ,"This is a film which must be seen by admirers of the late pianist. It's packed with images, words (often in Richter's own voice - in Russian - and surprisingly, ON-CAMERA), and sounds. I am so glad to have this on video.
I only wish it were available on DVD in the USA.",933292800,9,269,4.09433962264151
1219215,5,B00000I7PQ,"This is an overwhelming experience. A fascinating portrait of one of the great artists of our time, it is beautifully crafted and is at turns poignant, witty, astonishing, and frustrating. If you love the piano, if  you love music, if you admire Richter's recordings, then you must see this  summary of his life. More importantly, if you have always been curious  about his musical tastes and his personality, if you wanted to know more  about him, hear his voice and look into his eyes, if you've always wondered  what it is that separates a great artist from the legions of talented  ""performers"", then this film is a revelation. Not because it  provides an answer to those questions. It does not. It provides the  converse. Just as Richter despised superfluous analysis, this film depicts  how ultimately futile it is for us to attempt to understand the myriad  influences and events that conspire to create an artistic genius of this  proportion. We can no more understand Richter than we can understand a  Mozart or a DaVinci or a Michelangelo. And the film makes it painfully  clear that Richter himself, like many great artists, could not understand  his gift. Unfortunately, due in large part to his perfectionism and  self-criticism, his talent was both a gift and a curse. One has to wonder  if he was ever truly happy, or if he understood the joy that his music  brought to other people. Enigma indeed! Let us all simply be thankful that  occasionally, through divine intervention or through random circumstances,  the world is blessed with a human being of such complex beauty and  individuality that analysis becomes irrelevant. They are simply a gift to  humanity. Such was Richter.",922406400,46,1696,4.92226148409894
1219216,5,B00000I7PQ,This is one of the greatest videos made about an artist. Superlative interpretations. Great comments about his fellow artists. His childhood is described in a few percutant words. A lot of details on his approach to  music. Why he always waits 30 seconds between starting his playing in  concert or recital. I discovered a new approach of Schubert's sonatas from  Glen Gould's comments on Richter's playing and from his playing. Equal to  John Ardoin's on Callas. When will the DVD be available in America?,921628800,5,506,4.988095238095238
7909609,2,B00000I7PQ,"The picture is fuzzy, the subtitles lost in the moving miasma of a swirling background, and the video is just too difficult to enjoy. A real disappointment, because I was looking forward to knowing more about this great pianist.",1519084800,,228,4.871794871794871
7909610,5,B00000I7PQ,"I would recommend this to any Richter fan who can play VHS. I learned much, including his personal opinion of Prokofiev. It arrived sooner than expected and was in new condition.",1360195200,,178,4.774193548387097
7909611,5,B00000I7PQ,"This film about the incomparable Russian pianist Sviatoslav Richter is an experience for everyone who has been affected by this man's amazing talent. Richter was often called the best pianist in the world and not just by critics, but by many leading pianists of the day. This film contains treasures of archival footage of Richter in recitals, his own recollections of his long and fascinating life and the interviews given just before his death. Richter was notoriously camera and tape recorder shy, and the lengthy interview in this documentary is the only comprehensive interview he ever gave. For the most part the sole interviewee is Richter himself, but there are brief contributions from his piano teacher Heinrich Neuhaus, Richter's wife the soprano Nina Dorliac and pianist Glenn Gould, and so what you get is his life story from his point of view. Monsaingeon uncovered a phenomenal amount of exceptionally rare archive footage both of Richter himself and of Soviet life. Most of the footage is of Richter performing, and this part is absolutely riveting to watch. Some of the many composers featured include Liszt, Bach, Debussy, Ravel, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Chopin and Rachmaninoff among many others. It is a well documented and puzzling fact that Richter was always extremely dissatisfied with his performances, while everyone else thought they were superb. Richter's life was filled with extraordinary events and he had the kind of life that many people dream about and envy. But when you come to the end of the film you witness Richter with his face buried in his hand overcome with despair. He looks straight into the camera and says, ""I do not like myself"" and then the film ends as Schubert's second movement of his D.960 piano sonata is heard in the background. This is the enigma that the film puts before us. I know this film is difficult to find available on Amazon, but I ordered mine off of Ebay for a very reasonable price.",1191801600,4,1949,4.945121951219512
7909612,5,B00000I7PQ,"Believe all the superlatives,this is one of the greatest films ever made about a musician...slightly sycophantic on the subject of Glenn Gould (he once said Gould's behaviour wasn't eccentric....Hmmmm),Bruno Monsaingeon is just about perfect in the way he has assembled together Richter and filmed him wistfully talking away in his later years.

The film transcends the category of a documentary about one of the greatest pianists of all time. Partly,this is because Richter's own interests were so diverse and not confined to the limited orbit of piano playing. He often speaks about his interest in theatre,contemporary music,Opera and painting. But the way he speaks is so touching! the impact of this film would've been halved had it been dubbed (heaven forbid!)

Important relationships are touched upon (Benjamin Britten,Natalia Gutmann,Gavrilov),musical extracts which leave you craving for more, and a great deal of historical context-the difficulties of Stalinist Russia and the despair at touring the USA

Richter,the enigma is a film to cherish.",1150243200,8,1056,5.546583850931677
7909613,5,B00000I7PQ,"An in-depth and most worthwhile portrait of this great pianist.

In an interview when he was 80 years old, Richter told us how he started his career as a pianist. He said he had three teachers: his father, Neuhaus and Wagner. He also told us that he never practised any scale or excercise. Instead he started with Chopin's Nocturne and Etude...

His views on Heuhaus is quite different from Ashkenazy's. But it is quite interesting nevertjelss. He thought the unevenness of Heuhaus's performance was a result of his deevtion in teaching ( that might well be the case for Schnabel and Horszowski).  We have clip of Heuhaus' performance so that we can judge for ourselves. He also told us what he had learned from this great teacher. He also told us which perfomances in his own career he himself was happy with differed hugely from  general reception!

He also touched upon the eminent Yudina (and verse visa ) with a passing comment on Gilel, whih was very positive. He was full of  admiration for Oistrakh. There was a clip or two when Richter and Oistrakh performed together. Richter was, however, rather categoric in his disagreement with and pronounced in his dislike for Karajan and the word he used was ""unforgivable""-- Karajan's Mahler was quite alright so said Richter. There were a clip or two where he performed with Rostropovich whose stance on music according to Richter would ""shift"" in no time...  Richter was instead full of praise for his former pupil Gutman. He performed some chamber music together with the latter and also Oleg Kagan.  (From other source, as far as cellist as concerned, it is clear that Richter prefers Daniil Shafran to Rostropovich.) We can also have sight of how he rehearsed with Kagan, Fisher Dieskau among others. It is, however, a pity that there is no mention of either Michalengeli whom he admired or Kocsis whom he performed together so often!

Here Richter is most honest about his difficulty with playing Mozart despite the fact that there is a most precious clip of him playing a Mozart duet with Benjamin Britten which is most dazzling. There is a further clip showing Richter playing part of a Mozart Sonata.

He talked with some detail about Prokofiev (and how he was influenced by Rachmaninov) and then Glinka and Shostokovich. There are alo some rather generous comments by Rubinstein and some crisp remarks by Glenn Gould on his Schubert...

On the whole, within the 2.5 hour running time, you can expect about a quarter of it to see Richter on the keyboard some B/W and so in colour until a couple of years before his death. Nonetheless, the angles of view are most excellent. Some were taken from the ariel and some with his hands (and part of his wrists) higlighted. For the first part i.e. before he became famous, we have lot valuable clips showing how St Petersberg and Moscow were like in the early part of the century and what Russia was like at that time. A very good documentary on the modern history of Russia as well.",1127260800,8,2985,4.732177263969171
7909614,5,B00000I7PQ,"Does anyone have the coordinates for ""nvc arts""?",1039392000,5,48,5.125
7909615,5,B00000I7PQ,"In a few words this masterpiece lets itself describe, with honour and merit to what Richter deserves, but at the same time overloaded with superlatives for this whole concept.
I have quite a VHS-collection (between 500 and 600) of musicians (all genres), but this one beats everything: this film is ""OUT OF CATEGORY"" !!
The content of this VHS is about 1 of the 2 TITANS ever of the piano: Emil Gilels, whom Richter studied with at Moscow under Neuhaus, is the second one.
Concerning the film I will not spoil WHAT you will get to see and hear, but the makers of this 'movie' have well elaborated their theme.  I will always be grateful to them: S. Richter is about - what is called in the European classic music world - the last Lisztian performer at the piano.  Only Franz LISZT himself is in the neighbourhood when Svjatoslav Richter is touching his piano...  As always with Richter his 'legato' playing (at Moscow he chose for legato, leaving 'the rest', meaning assai playing was more the style of Emil Gilels) keeps astonishing the listener.  I was very pleased nd surprised that the editors have been able to find that much rare footage: this pianist lived under Stalin and the Sovjetregime...
I have no problem to say that this VHS is A ""REAL"" MUST for all those who love the piano 'singing'.  If you can, than also buy or listen to the triple CD that contains Richters pianowork as you can hear playing at the VHS.  The experiences are not the same (different means!), but I can assure you that both are VINTAGE PRODUCTS.
P.S.: For those who are not acquainted with the word ""Lisztian"", it means more or less that the pianist can still perform in the style of the great virtuoso Franz Liszt was himself.  Only a good dozen (Richter, Gilels, Horowitz, Michelangeli, Fischer, Arrau, Backhaus,...) may wear this title since Paderewski and Cortot.",1032739200,18,1852,4.68
7909616,5,B00000I7PQ,"At one point in the film, Richter shares with the viewer how he reached his share of (musical) wisdom. It came when Robert Falk (a Muskovite painter) revealed to Richter what seems to be the most difficult achievement in painting: drawing a perfect circle. Then, Richter transfers this insight to music by saying that music has to achieve symmetry. From a different source, zen philosophy, Celibidache, the late conductor and maverick musician, reaches a very similar conclusion: music needs to return where it started. In other words, no matter the  displacement, one has to be back when the music is over. Hence, the great music becomes a spiritual journey akin to initiation.

The risk in writing about this film comes when too small of a lens is applied to such rather long life and career; the viewer can get most anything (read distortion) out of the film. This point is especially obvious when one reads too much, and aloud, in Richter's last statement on this tape.

Of huge value I found the footage with Richter's past performances scattered throughout the film for it is difficult to imagine all the dynamism surrounding his interpretations unless such visual clues are provided. The scenes with the ever playful Richter color even further what is meant to stay as one of the most canonical musicians of the past century.

In ths film, Monsaingeon delivers his best achievements to date. Being first,  naturally, and most aware of the difficulty of his task, the film's author draws our attention once more to what Richter is (even after this film) an enigma!

When I saw prices dropping under twenty for this Region 2 dvd, I decided to buy it.  On smart players/computers, it makes little to no difference.

As for the film itself, I can say now, after so many years and  having watched classical-music dvds in the high-tens, that it has remained the best.  Yes, Monsaingeon, one of the better film makers of this genera, gets sleeker, the sound better, and the artists themselves play as it were for the camera, but ""Richter, the Enigma"" still reins supreme.  There are two other dvds that come close, both with and about Celibidache, one discontinued that is probably just as good as this one, and the other&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Celibidache-You-Don-t-Do-Anything-You-Let-It-Evolve/dp/B001U1L9L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Celibidache: You Don't Do Anything, You Let It Evolve</a>.

7909617,5,B00000I7PQ,"Superb artful and scholarly documentary film by Bruno Monsaingeon.
