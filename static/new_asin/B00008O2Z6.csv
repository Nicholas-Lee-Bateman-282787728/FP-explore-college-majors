8439939,4,B00008O2Z6,"Ok - I might be biased since I worked on the film, but I have yet to work on another film where the budget was low and the talent was high!
It is too bad that this movie has now almost become a social commentary on the violence we see in schools - while that was not the point of the film it is hard not to see how the kids in middle and high school ""Get caught up in all of the BS"" to quote Dan, the Hall Monitor.
I agree with one of the other reviews that it does lag a bit in the middle but it's a great film none the less!  One I am happy to have in my collection!",1089849600,,568,3.5806451612903225
8439940,5,B00008O2Z6,"What did you hate MOST about high school? The relentless hierarchy of social status? The simultaneous pressures of going through biological changes AND trying to look like you AREN'T going through biological changes? How about the lack of competent role models and support resources? These feelings and more are brought to life in, ""The Hall Monitor"" except this time - there's justice in the hallways! This is a perfect movie for those of us who are still bitter about the torture of high school. My only gripe about this DVD is Troma's inappropriate marketing ploy ""intro"" - it has nothing to do with the film and well, it's just plain nauseating to anyone who isn't a white, heterosexual male. Might I add - the waiter in the cafeteria scene rules!",1072137600,2,751,4.7846153846153845
8439941,4,B00008O2Z6,"In the grand tradition of Toxie and Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD comes Dan Kashwood - The Hall Monitor! Dealing death and judgement in the halls of a 'typical' high school, this character stands alone as one of the most offensive and hilarious heroes ever to grace a Troma movie.
For a low budget shoot-em-up comedy it holds together pretty well. The middle tends to drag a bit (hence the 4 stars) but it builds to such a ridiculous cilmax that it's a minor complaint.
Like many of the reviewers I saw this flick at a film festival in AC like 2 years ago and am thrilled it will finally be available on DVD. Troma usually loads their discs with extras. Will there be any on THM?! I hope so. If you're not easily offended give this one a look. Destined to become a cult classic, at least in my collection.",1052784000,,795,4.342281879194631
8439942,5,B00008O2Z6,"Enter The Hall Monitor.
I saw this gem at some flim flam festival in Atlantic City and it made feel a whole lot better about losing all my money.  I've been looking for it ever since 1999. . . and finally, here it is.
Now I can finally prove to my friends that I wasn't dreaming about the flick with the best frog dissection scene ever.
This movie is funny and funny.",1052611200,2,367,4.097222222222222
8439943,5,B00008O2Z6,"I saw this Film a few years ago at a special screening at Penn State University, had a chance to meet the filmmakers and cast and essentially had a blast with the whole experience. Watch it once and I'm sure this movie will quickly jump to the top of your Favorite Cult Film list. It takes place in a world somewhere between Sixteen Candles and Dirty Harry, with a Magnum toting ' Cheap suit wearing - One-liner delivering Hall Monitor, who's hellbent on keeping order among the student population of Rocky Mountain High. He's not the only unusual character at this school, as there's also the evil Guidance Counselor, a Giant Carrot, the Ultra-Violent Football Team, cup smothering, shoe stabbing, assembly executions and last, but not least, NAKED CHEERLEADERS!!! Whew, that was a mouthful. The guys who did this movie must have been crazy, as they did it for very little money, but they made up for it with a very talented cast, an incredibly funny script and a couple of Very Big Brass Ones (If you know what I mean). This movie easily ranks up there with the early films of such great directors as Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson with cartoonish violence, tons of quotable lines and cult characters that you can get behind and root for. I have been dying to get this on DVD since first seeing it, ... Do yourself a favor and buy this disc, you'll be glad you did.",1051056000,,1364,4.548780487804878
