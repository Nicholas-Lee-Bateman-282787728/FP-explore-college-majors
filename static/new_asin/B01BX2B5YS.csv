7670179,3,B01BX2B5YS,"I've loved this series, but there has been a steep falling-off. The fifth season consists of only three episodes and a single story line which is a bit of a snore. The absence of the Gill Murray character has had a major impact. Her leaving was a huge loss. The two lead actresses are excellent as ever, but there isn't as much richness and depth to their characters as there was before. It's definitely over.",1476489600,2,409,4.466666666666667
7670180,3,B01BX2B5YS,I loved the first four seasons. I was disappointed in this one. It seemed disjointed. I miss the big boss Amelia Bullhead. I wish Rachel would pull herself together better. This is her 2nd pregnancy. She should of been a bit more responsible. They need to get their players more active in the story.,1476316800,,299,4.555555555555555
7670181,3,B01BX2B5YS,"Enjoyable, but enough loose ends to be cause for another season.
I missed Gil , and this proves how much she contributed to the story line when absent from the scenes.
I thought it was O/k. but not as compelling as previous seasons.
This is NOT O/K to sell a ""season"" of  3 episodes only.
I didn't see an announcement that due to 3 episodes only, on the one DVD , the price was adjusted and cheaper.
It seemed the producers/writers just ran out of steam , doesn't it?",1476144000,13,467,4.247191011235955

7670184,5,B01BX2B5YS,"I love this program . The actors seem to be the most physically actors  from any British  show of this subject matter. I live in the United States  and watch thru ""hulu"".  I can hardly wait for #5, but I also know it's the last show. I has to be a very tiring and wearing show for all the actors, You have one off the greatest group  of actors.  I appreciate the ""bit"" actors (don""t know  if that is American slang) All the actors make ""Scott and Bailey"" one of the finest.  I watch ""NCIS :Criminal Intent""  Love the story lines much better.

Congratulations,,but I sure wish you and the show were continuing, Watch the 5thSeries

never forget you, have all the dvds",1466294400,4,666,4.333333333333333
7670185,5,B01BX2B5YS,"This is, apparently, the final series for Scott & Bailey, though one can always hope.  Series 5 consists of three episodes.  It is, essentially, a 3-act feature film of 135 minutes.  A serial killer is operating in Manchester.  Locales are marked with a chalk star and then bodies are found.  It appears to be some sort of game, operating via the Darknet.  How many killers are involved?  Is there one killer and another individual who manages him?  Do they know one another?  Whats going on out there besides murder, mayhem and horrific, bloody stabbings?

Rachel has returned from London and reunites with the now-retired Gill Murrays old team, including her pal Janet.  With Gill retired and the budgets tight they are rotating in different supervisors from different syndicates.  For the time being (2 weeks) Rachel is appointed acting Detective Inspector and put in charge of the case.  Her view is that they have put her on a short leash to avoid paying her the additional salary after a given amount of time has expired.  The theme of tight police resources continues across the three episodes, contributing to the tension.  Rachel and her team are too short of staff to conduct an investigation that covers much of Manchester and they are unable to protect all of the individuals whose homes have been marked with chalk stars.

As always with Scott & Bailey there are personal problems which raise the tension level and contribute to the drama.  Rachel is four-months pregnant and Janets daughter and her underage boyfriend have been caught sexting.  Because of their ages this is a prosecutable crime.

The story is engaging, the local atmospherics strong, the direction solid.  We all miss Gill (Amelia Bullmore was not only contributing her brilliant acting; she was also writing S&B scripts), but the writing is excellent, with the staccato dialogue for which the series is known.  Some loose ends are tied up at the end of the third episode (which I will not spoil), so this could well be the end of the series.  If so, season five is a fitting (though all too brief) conclusion to that series.

Note: the American edition will be released in March, 2017 with a fairly hefty price for a single disc with 3 episodes.  The UK edition is available now, at approximately half that price.  Some are able to play the UK region discs on their computers.  I recommend an all-regions player.  Amazon.com sells them for around $100.  I have two, each made by Pioneer.  They are simple to operate; you just pop in the disc, the machine reads the regional code and the show begins.  Having an all-regions player enables you to get European shows much earlier and it enables you to comparison-shop with regard to price.

Note also: Amazon.co.uk will allow you to pay in American dollars rather than British sterling so you don't have to pay additional fees on your credit card.  The Amazon.co.uk exchange rates strike me as quite fair.",1464998400,45,2935,4.819639278557114
7670186,4,B01BX2B5YS,"Really liked it, but felt a bit ripped off as it only had 3 episodes!!",1463875200,4,70,3.7333333333333334
7670187,5,B01BX2B5YS,"Theres been some changes due to the story-lines of season 4. A few gone, allowing for some new members. But the show proved last season with a writing change, it will survive in the same glory. Season 5 began airing in April of 2016. Personally, I find the DVDs better than the TV schedule, because much of the story-line for the lead characters is a continuing and developing life story. I hate to wait a week between episodes. Soooo, I wait for my DVD. How do I know it is worthy of 5 stars? Because it was 5 stars at the debut season, and it got better and better after that. Bad cop shows do not make it to season 5. I am eager for #5 and beyond.

Never fear, Suranne Jones, playing DS Rachel Bailey, returns as in the past, along with her more stable co-investigator cop, Lesley Sharp as DC Janet Scott. Amelia Bullmore, who played DCI Gill Murphy, has retired from this series. Darn, I really liked her. You may spot Anthony Flanagan from The Village, and I really like him in that. Scott and Bailey, know their roles, the female cop characters, so well they lead this show to greatness. If youve missed the first 4 seasons, get them first. You will want to know the history of these crime solvers with catastrophic lives.",1459641600,14,1228,4.385964912280702
7670188,5,B01BX2B5YS,great series! missed Gill though in Season 5 but that was what they wanted from the beginning that bailey would become Gill. The lighting changes though were annoying and I missed the old brighter set. Season 5 tried to be hollywood and it didn't need to be bc the whole series held it's own. So it was just odd that they did that for season 5.,1527984000,,344,4.2272727272727275

7670190,2,B01BX2B5YS,"After ruminating a bit on this season, I have decided that I hated it. ""Scott & Bailey"" has been one of my favorite finds from across the pond. I've really enjoyed the stunning acting of the stars, the interesting writing (with the exception of some episodes which ""borrowed"" a bit too freely from plot devices featured in the original ""Prime Suspect"" series - yes, I noticed! ) and the female focus of this crime/ detective series. I think by seasons 3 and 4, the male colleagues became less caricatured - which I appreciated, assuming this tweak was in response to valid criticism that male characters were so far in the background as to be mere doltish foils to the women. Season 5 just went crazy. The crime premise - murders on the ""dark web"" - interesting.  The actual investigation into this crime? A mess.  I could not keep track of the parade of suspects and various persons of interest; theories of motivation for the crimes were not persuasive; the interactions and relationships among the detectives seemed contrived and out of character - very uncomfortable to watch actually. The tension of this series, it seems to me, has been in the interview room. The fascinating back and forth between suspects, witnesses and the interviewing detectives was extremely effective at building the suspense and laying the expository groundwork for the crime in previous seasons. In season 5, however, this feature - very strangely - was underplayed to a fault. The changes in the relationship between the two principal detectives - Janet and Rachel - didn't make sense to me. Are we really expected to believe that these intimate friends would not stay in touch during Rachel's year in London? Are we also expected to believe that they would not be in touch - AT ALL - with Gil, their recently retired SIO - with whom they were also friends? Hated that a cop died sort of nonsensically; hated the sub-plot involving Janet's daughter; hated Janet's lecture to her younger female colleagues about ""carrying on"" for the sake of all older women in the force (like she's a has-been); hated Rachel's tough, unreasonable, condescending persona; hated that she was pregnant again and acting irresponsibly; hated the fact that everyone - except Rachel- was played like a Keystone cop; hated that Mitch lost his day book (and didn't believe it); didn't believe that some reporter got hold of it. Hated that they didn't tie up all loose ends ( like explaining the missing day book). Hated the ending because the renewed intimacy between Janet and Rachel hadn't been earned and was therefore unbelievable. Sorry but I just hated it.",1517184000,3,2619,4.883146067415731
7670191,3,B01BX2B5YS,"I started out loving this program. Then it got crappy. Then crappier. And just when I decided to stop watching it, I realized I was on the last episode. Hahaha! Looks like they knew it was worth continuing. They could have done much better with this.",1517097600,,250,4.456521739130435

7670203,1,B01BX2B5YS,"Wow, after four seasons where one was continually entertained by the personal lives as well as the professional lies of both Janet and Rachel, what in the world happened in Season 5? Okay, so I understand that frequently when an individual does not take care of emotional issues, one can go off the rails and make very serious mistakes, but does every character have to do this at the same time in the same season?

1. Rachel KNOWS that she is incapable of being a good parent.
2. What in the world was the lighting director thinking when everything was so dark one could not even see the screen for many scenes. The sets were similar to the first four episodes, but larger, and who knows what color the walls were, the set was so dark, one could not tell. This was not the way to convey the loss of Gill by darkening the office.
3. I can see why the staff might have reacted to Rachel as they did, she is a twit, but this was a serious case, it was NOT the time to be pulling in all directions and not working together. And, I have always wondered, how can Rachel be such a smoker and still run so far and so fast and still have the wind to take down the perp? That does NOT make sense, in any of the seasons.
4. After five years, ought not Rachel to have learned a few things about herself and not continue to be as dysfunctional as she is. She is a serious handicap to police work. Why is she NOT forced to talk to someone? I cannot see her going off into her middle age and then begin to age and not do serious damage to this child and to the force and to society. She is not learning anything about herself. There is no awareness. Somewhat like a current leader of the US. Oof!
5. Who stole Mitch's Day Book? Who would want to compromise this situation by doing something so unprofessional? And, the scene right before his death, both Janet and Mitch were in La La land. They were way too well trained to have done what both of them did. Their behavior and the dialogue in that scene was too far below the professionalism of the first four seasons to be believable in the 5th Season. I have to say this, even if it is mean. The writers sucked. Did they even watch the first four seasons? It was as if one put a bunch of monkeys into a room with typewriters and expected them to eventually type up Shakespeare's cannon. It did NOT work well at all.",1495497600,6,2352,4.19205298013245
7670204,5,B01BX2B5YS,I thought it brought all of the previous story line an end but that the conclusion was too short and hurried to end at a certain time.  Should of had at least 2 more episodes to do series a proper ending,1495065600,,203,3.951219512195122

7670227,5,B01BX2B5YS,Great series.  I was glad to find the latest season on Amazon.,1491004800,,62,4.166666666666667
7670228,5,B01BX2B5YS,"I first saw Scott&Bailey on our PBS station, this is a television series from England, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones. The series started in 2011, but I saw the first series in 2014. Season 5 appears to be the last of the series.

The two detectives have found new lives so to speak. Rachel moved to Look neon in Series 4, and has now returned. With DI Gill gone, she is now Acting DI. The Team is not so sure theyvare hapoy she is back. A serial killer is on the rounds in Manchester, and with decreased resources, investigation is tight. Janet has issues with her daughter, and is embroiled in a very uncomfortable situation. Rachel has her own issues thatcsre growing larger every day.

The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience. Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. In her 30's, her drinking and smoking have taken their toll. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and she us beginning to look old. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?

In season 5, the cases are tougher, much of the time it is a woman as the victim.  Their private lives at this time involve men and drinking, and, as been stated Rachel Bailey is a binge drinker, often showing up at work with a hangover. But Rachel has given that up for now. The male detectives they work with are supportive, but can be found teasing with male jokes. They all work well together, and everyone will do whatever it takes. Discipline and excellent police work is the word of the day- good series, and I am sorry this is the last.

She is sorry. Scott is better but she does some sorry things her own self. The acting is good, at least I hope they are not like the characters in real life and the stories are interesting.

7670232,3,B01BX2B5YS,"I binged the first four seasons of this show, reveling in its smart, subtle dialogue, deeply drawn, sharp, funny, flawed female characters, and its willingness to move at whatever pace best told the story. It was fantastic. It was procedural drama done almost perfectly. And then Season 5 arrived, and everything got shallower: the characters, the dialogue. And it also got unbelievable: the characters, the dialogue, the storyline. Instead of being utterly in the story, I found myself sitting outside it, not believing it. I imagine they thought they were being dark & edgy, but instead they were being shallow & just like everybody else. I really dislike it when that happens.

7670295,2,B01BX2B5YS,"I can't believe that this is how they will end this show. Scott and Bailey has been one of my all time favorites, and to watch this pathetic, poorly written final season was a real disappointment. I agree with all the reviewers who said the writing and directing have gone downhill, almost to the point that you don't recognize the characters. The characters, including the sorely missed ""Gill"", really made the original series so entertaining. Now, you can hardly even recognize Janet or Rachel. And the writing! This dark, sinister plot! Ugh. Simply disgusting. Why do writers feel they have to make crime movies more and more graphic and scary?  It doesn't add to the interest - in fact, it sort of stops the drama, in the way of interrupting your belief. Asking, ""Hmm, could this really happen? Seems a bit unlikely...""  Plus, it was really confusing and hard to follow.
Also, the subplot about Janet's daughter was unbelievable in that the police were so intent on prosecuting her for her teenage foolishness. I doubt that they would be wasting scarce resources on this issue.
I would strongly recommend all the previous seasons, if you haven't seen them. You will love this show. But STOP before going on to Season 5. Just let the last episode of Season 4 be ""The End.""",1479340800,2,1275,4.738738738738738

7670305,5,B01BX2B5YS,"OMG!  What an exciting season!  Of all the recent police dramas available, I believe this to be one of the best.  From a viewers perspective, the relationship between Rachel (Suranne Jones) and Janet (Lesley Sharp) appears truly effortless, and genuine.  This season sees Janet dealing with family issues usually reserved for Rachel's side, and Rachel comes into her own, albeit due to Janet's decision to pass on the promotion that sees Rachel in her current role.
The only disappointment I found (for me) is that this season concludes with only three episodes.",1478304000,,562,5.076086956521739

It's like they are trying to make her so smart it is aggravating. After Gil, Janet is the best police person in this series. Her character is the only reason I gave this a 3 star rating. I will miss the show but I'll not miss Rachel. As for Janet's problem with her daughter, It was sad to see Janet having to beg for favors.

7670322,3,B01BX2B5YS,"I am in the US and just received this DVD.  As one that appreciated the first three seasons of this series, I looked forward to this, ordering it months ago when it was first announced... and then forgot about it until it arrived last Thursday.  My first disappointment was that this was only one disc; three episodes compared to the usual 6-8 in past seasons.  I always feel that the price for British shows (BBC or Acorn) is high, and do feel that a list price of nearly $30 (list of $29.98, on Amazon for $23.90) for one DVD (not Blu-ray) is a bit much.  My second disappointment was seeing that Amelia Bullmore (who both wrote for the series and played Detective Chief Inspector Gill Murray) was not involved at all in this series other than a mention of her character having retired.  But my real disappointment was in the tone of the show, itself.  Perhaps that is because Sally Wainwright (who created the show) obviously didn't have a big creative part in these episodes.  The characters have changed. Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) returns to Manchester from London as the temporary head of the unit and is unsure and touchy.  The normally steady Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp), who had kept Bailey in some semblance of a line, now seems unsure; her marriage ended, and her daughter is now accused of sexting her boyfriend.  Neither of the main characters responds or interacts the way they had in the past, which was part of the charm of the series.  Like many UK miniseries, this began slowly which is problematic especially when there are only 3 episodes. The first episode was almost unwatchable; it was slow and confusing not really advancing the plot at all.  I found the last episode the best primarily because I like the ""interview"" scenes that Sharp does so well.  I did think that the addition of new DC Anna Ram (Jing Lusi) was a good one but Rachel dismissed her as an irritant and overall she was used too sparingly.  I have read that this is probably the last season of the show.  If so, this tied up a few loose ends but went out with a whimper not fitting the rest of the series.",1477180800,3,2099,4.5331564986737405
7670323,3,B01BX2B5YS,"The comments for season 5 are spot on. Yes, Lesley Sharp and Suranne Jones are excellent....it is the writing, direction and editing that have negatively impacted the episodes.

Amelia Bullmore- plays Gill is sorely missed as an actress, pivotal character....AND as a writer on the series. Some of her scripts were the best. The changes in directors, as well as poor editing added up to a series that went out with a wimper.

Seasons 1-4 are witty, biting, funny, with excellent dialog, acting and direction, too bad the producers made so many radical changes in the final season that made the last episodes seem inconsistent with an overall memorable series.",1477094400,10,659,4.9818181818181815

8751795,1,B01BX2B5YS,"For a series that has such a stellar beginning this has totally bottomed out. The actors have continued with their jobs well but the writers have left the building! The thought for me that something happened off camera just after the seasons start, something drastic. Not wanting to just loose the cost of the up to then investment the directors chopped up and created three confusing and under produced episodes. The believability of the crime is sketchy and the law that is presented is doubtful in its veracity. If you are considering watching this season after viewing the four previous ,sorry don't waste your time. Certainly don't waste your money. This does not advance of conclude the story.",1537574400,,699,4.932203389830509

8751797,5,B01BX2B5YS,"I loved this series.  I hated it when it ended.  Lesley Sharp played Janet Scott, the older, ""maternal"" detective. Suranne Jones, the personification of Dr. Who's TARDIS, played Rachel Bailey, the single, brash, hard-drinking, hard-working  40-something detective.  The setting in Manchester pulled it all together for interesting blue-collar crimes.  The characters looked real and acted to their true characters' natures.  The storylines were something out of the newspapers.  Add Amelia Bullmore as the Chief Superintendent and you've got a winning show.  The women on the show were highly intelligent, capable and diverse.  They had it all until the husbands and lovers became problematic. They were attractive without being sexualized. They even displayed two fashion styles of dress for the professional women of two different eras accurately.  I remember dressing like Janet Scott for the first ten to 15 years in the office, then, ending up dressing like Rachel Bailey closer to my retirement.  I really enjoyed the show  I would like to see more shows from Sally Wainwright.  Great job Women!",1536883200,,1101,5.368421052631579
8751798,1,B01BX2B5YS,"I was intensely hooked on this show - just loved it and binged it on Prime every chance I got and then came the final season.  From Love to Hate, snap of the fingers.  First of all, why had Rachel done to London for a year and what did she do there?  I must have missed the explanation. What kind of friend was she to Janet to not be in touch.  I couldn't stand Rachel from the start and that just clinched it.  A totally self-serving, nasty, out-of-control bitch.  No other way to describe her. Loved Janet though, the best interrogator ever and hilarious a season back when she fell into that routine during speed dating.  As one or more other reviewers mentioned, what was with making everything dark?  Wasn't that the same room Gill led the meetings in, bright and cheerful?  That reminded me of how I love TV Star Trek but dislike Star Trek movies - the silly darkness.  Please.  Anyone working, whether it's in a police department or a star ship would want good lighting so they can SEE things.  I also didn't enjoy the silly serial killer thing; so much more fun to just have a regular crime per episode and enjoy the police procedural.  I don't know what anyone was thinking when they put together this final season.",1536278400,,1224,4.434977578475336

8751800,5,B01BX2B5YS,"Suranne Jones is some kind of genius, and Lesley Sharp is her equal. What characters they've created! The series is filled with amazing scenes: Watch Rachael Bailey's face when Janet Scott dresses her down for some bad behavior  you can see her discomfort as she listens and learns, but will she learn fast enough to avoid becoming her mother? See Scott and Bailey synopsize their careers and brilliantly ace their Sargent's interviews. Watch Bailey chase suspects on foot with the same relentless, wild energy as she brings to everything; disastrous outcomes, like going under a bus, are a sort of running joke. The ""PNC'd vehicle"" thread is great  Scott stands with Bailey, leading to the classic scene where Gill agrees to keep it all secret, Andy stands there clueless, and Scott makes it all work. Everyone respects Bailey, and Gill can manage her, but only Scott knows how to be her friend. There is much more.

Almost all the men in this world are criminals or defuses, if occasionally useful, and the women are mostly smart, strong and mutually supportive. The cases are satisfyingly complex and the writing is often brilliant, making it easy enough to laugh-off the undisguised misandristic tilt.",1535846400,,1205,4.985074626865671
