4932206,5,B0062KMDWU,"This collection of Mr. Magoo's complete theatrical shorts (that is the ones that were produced for the movie theaters), is a long time coming!  It seems every major studio has issued an abundance of there very best animated shorts except for Columbia Pictures, and Paramount Pictures TerryToons Mighty Mouse, Heckly and Jekyll, et al  (That's left best alone for now).  But anyway Shout! Factory are the folks behind this Magoo release.  According to the Cartoon Brew WEBSITE, run by Jerry Beck, these DVDS will include 2 Oscar winners, When Magoo Flew and Magoos's Puddle Jumper, as well rare pencil tests, and audio commentaries by the likes of Emily Hubley, John Canemaker, AND Charles Soloman.  According to the book OF MICE AND MAGIC written by Leonard Maltin, there are about 51 Magoo shorts on this collection.  Of course the voice of Magoo is by Jim Backus of ""Gilligan's Island,"" fame.  Backus worked with some of the greats like Marilyn Monroe and James Dean.  A talented actor.  OH, Magoo you've done it again!  This is a can't miss collection!  I also heard that 1001 Arabian Nights, a 1959 feature film starring Mr. Magoo will also be featured as an additional bonus.  UPDATE!!!  E-mailed Shout! and they said they are still waiting for Sony to remaster these cartoons.  THEY HOPE TO HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN A FEW MONTHS.  July/2013.  Another UPDATE!  They have finally set APRIL 22, 2014, as the official release date!!!  F I N A L L Y!  It was well worth the wait.  The TECHNICOLOR transfers look amazing.

4932215,5,B0062KMDWU,While I was quite familiar with the made for tv Mr. Magoo cartoons and I had seen a few of the theatrical cartoons I never realized so many of them had been made. I really enjoyed watching these and how Mr. Magoo transformed into the character many of us loved in the tv series of cartoons. Video quality of these cartoons is excellent with many of them being in their true wide screen format!.

4932228,5,B0062KMDWU,"As a kid in the 60's I remember seeing magoo on t.v. but this is a whole other world!  I bought the jolly frolics dvd and saw the magoo shorts and liked them, but was not sure about a whole set of just magoo.  I decided to take a chance and boy, was I glad that I did!  As an artist, I was in heaven with all the stylized and vibramt backgrounds and colors!  I had bought magoo's christmas carol, and although I enjoyed that, this was more light-hearted and fun.  I have noticed that many talents from disney appear on the credits also. I really admire the talent and work they put into them, so many years ago! I find a smile on my face each time I watch them.",1433894400,7,661,4.015267175572519

4932230,5,B0062KMDWU,I have never seen these before and they are much funnier and consist of more complex stories with unique story lines.  Much different from the ones I remember on TV that were slower in pace and not very clever in humor quality.,1432252800,4,227,4.404761904761905
4932231,5,B0062KMDWU,"These cartoons first appeared in my local theater when I was 9 years old.  They continued appearing until I was 18 years old. Having been raised on Mick Mouse, Donald Duck, Tom and Jerry, and the gang in the Looney Tunes cartoons, I was not all that impressed by Mr. Magoo.  The films were funny but I couldn't really relate to him since I did not have his problems nor did anyone I knew.  Now that I'm just shy of 74 years old and with vision problems, I understand this humor -  very well!

This is a great set where the films are presented in their original aspect ratio and the restorations are first rate. The films look good, and sound good. There's just on tiny problem.  The listing on the back of the DVD case has several mistakes.  Some titles are not in the same order as the appear on the individual DVDs. Some of the aspect ratio information is also incorrect.  These are minor issues since most viewers will rely on the menu appearing on their television screen.  Still, as a service to anyone else who is considering purchasing this set, I've included a listing of the contents of each disc.  Also included is the aspect ration and a notation when a particular title has a commentary available.

4932233,5,B0062KMDWU,This DVD is a real treat for me - i don't believe i have seen any of these. I grew up with the tv Mr. Magoo cartoons so i look forward to watching these. The ones i have seen so far look great. Great color and sound. So for anyone who grew up watching only the tv cartoons this is a good set to own,1422921600,,298,3.6

As a child I loved watching an adult bungle through life in a way that made him and all of them a bit more relatable, now I get the sly humor behind the bungle. I loved the theatrical versions -- who knew?!",1416182400,2,332,4.123076923076923

4932240,5,B0062KMDWU,"I had only seen a couple of the classic Mr. Magoo cartoons, but I don't remember their looking this colorful, sharp and bright. The audio is clear and dialogue easy to understand. All in all, this is an outstanding restoration and worth the wait from the folks at Shout Factory.

4932243,1,B0062KMDWU,"They have been edited so they are politically correct for this day and time as the liberals believe, it ruined them.  They are not as funny as originally they were.

They were good clean and no sexual double meanings as current day comedy usually is.",1409616000,5,391,4.342465753424658
4932244,5,B0062KMDWU,These are actually better than I expected. The video is perfect and they are fun to watch.

4932259,4,B0062KMDWU,"This is a gorgeous transfer to standard definition DVD. Previously, I'd only seen these theatrical shorts on VHS and they always looked awful. I'd give this collection a five star rating if it were on BluRay. That's it's only fault in my opinion, but it took so long for them to be released on DVD it probably will take another decade before that happens. If you know the Magoo character, or love the UPA style this is a must.",1403395200,5,426,4.405063291139241

4932262,5,B0062KMDWU,"Mr. Magoo is a rich old retired white guy who just does and says whatever he wants.  these old Mr. Magoo classics were bastardized by the politically correct forces which I think is totally wrong for reasons I have already stated elsewhere.  Mr. Magoo was politically incorrect but an effectively harmless old white guy.  I live in a building full of men just like him and they are nice to a fault.

I love Mr. Magoo because; he lives in his own world.  He can't see but he drives.  God watches out for Mr. Magoo who just wonders through life on blind faith that things will always work out.  Mr. Magoo might be very politically incorrect by todays standards but he is never mean spirited or harsh.  Mr. Magoo is politically incorrect because; he is in todays PSC world he's just clueless.  Even I am clueless in todays hyper politically correct world.  At work I ocassionally slip and say Oriential instead of Asian and the world comes to a grinding halt as harsh looks are directed at me.

Unfortunate as it might be growing up oriential was not considered a bad word.  Hell I can't count the Chinese food places I patronized that had the word Oriential in their name.  In Towson until recently there was a place called the Oriential Grill.  I say this because; Mr. Magoo is an old man who comes from a bygone era. He drives his trusty old car and lives to have fun.  Mr. Magoo always appears to be a man of privledge or at least the upper management or professional class.  Mr. Magoo is brash and self assured in ways that make watching him so much fun.  I grew up watching Mr. Magoo.  I used to be highly insulted when kids used to call me Mr. Magoo because I had bade vision autism and many disabilities so I fumbled around like Mr. Magoo.

Now that I have grown up and see how Mr. Magoo lives well and does his own thing no matter what folk say I enjoy being compared to Mr. Magoo.  After all Mr. Magoo is rich, he enjoys the life he made for himself in retirement.  Mr Magoo pays no mind to people and harms no one.  Mr. Magoo endures all his life's adversity with tenacity and a smile, I can think of no better way to tackle old age.  Mr. Magoo has is own fun in his own world, the more I think of it Mr. Magoo might be on the autism spectrum. Even if Mr. Magoo is not autistic its fun to think so because; he reveals what my retirement will be like God willing.",1401062400,7,2370,4.252796420581656
4932263,5,B0062KMDWU,"This collection has been long in coming: it's been announced for years. Having watched about one-half of it in the past two weeks, I'm happy to report that it was well worth the wait. I'm no expert, but the remastering looks excellent to me: the animation looks as though it could have been done yesterday--if yesterday you found a studio filled with 100 artists who did everything with pencils, ink, and paint. Here you have, on three discs, all 53 theatrical cartoons (1949-1959), including four Academy Award nominees and two winners. A fourth disc presents the feature-length rarity, ""1001 Arabian Nights"" (1959), which opened the door to television's ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" (1962) and ""The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo"" (1964). This set does not include those items or the syndicated UPA television shorts (1960), produced by Henry Saperstein, which are available elsewhere. Though it became more limited over the years, the quality of animation and production design of the theatrical Magoos is far superior to the TV product; the stories (written by Tedd Pierce, among others) and their execution are generally funnier. Supplemented in several instances with commentaries of widely divergent value, the five hours of toonmanship are fascinating: though the incomparable comedy of Jim Backus is the glue that binds Magoo, you can watch the character's evolution from ornery (courtesy of producer-director John Hubley) to sweet (Pete Burness). UPA's use of color and design was extraordinarily modernist and became more so over time. The only thing missing for those wanting the complete Magoo experience are the vintage animated commercials in which he starred for Piel's beer and, especially, General Electric. Kudos to Shout! for continuing to recover our popular culture with products of fine quality at affordable prices.",1400198400,20,1840,5.348275862068966
4932264,5,B0062KMDWU,"At long last, after nearly 3 years of on-again, off-again waiting, the Mr. Magoo Theatrical Collection is finally available! These theatrical cartoons have been hard to find and rare for many years. In a period when the television Magoo cartoons have seen two DVD releases within the last seven years, the theatrical Magoos have remained scarce. Now at last, it is possible to own all of Mr. Magoo's animated adventures.

We see an evolution of the character, from his rough beginnings in ""Ragtime Bear,"" a hilarious romp featuring a prototype of what would become the nearsighted Mr. Magoo. In his earliest appearances, Magoo looks and sounds different, though always voiced by Jim Backus from the very start.

Highlights include the Academy Award winners ""When Magoo Flew"" and ""Magoo's Puddle Jumper.""  Most of the adventures are wonderfully offbeat and bizarre, such as ""Kangaroo Courting"" and ""Destination Magoo."" ""Stage Door Magoo"" is a charming little gem that features Magoo in a theatrical setting, foretelling his role of an actor in the later TV series ""The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo"". ""Magoo's Masterpiece"" is about his foray into the world of art. These stories are clever and funny.

The drawback to the character is that he is essentially a one-joke guy--everything revolves around his nearsightedness. How exactly nearsighted he is varies from cartoon to cartoon--sometimes he can read a sign correctly word for word, but other times he reads it to mean whatever he chooses it to mean. The gags thus tend to be somewhat limited--Magoo mistakes a grizzly bear for his raccoon-coated nephew Waldo, mistakes a walrus for his best friend, etc. He definitely lives in a world of his own. He has a bit of dimensionality, however, in his occasional atruistic motives and his genuine desire to experience life to the fullest.

The collection also includes Magoo's one theatrical feature--""1001 Arabian Nights,"" a clear forerunner of Disney's Aladdin, and the source, either intentional or unintentional, of many of the concepts and gags that were used in the latter film. The film, though delightful in its individual scenes, is slow-moving in regard to its overall plot--it revels in individual gags but does not truly develop the characters in a compelling manner. It's more like an extended short than a feature film. Fans of Magoo will be very pleased with its inclusion in this set, but modern kids might be bored with it. If you can watch it with an appreciation of its voice talent and clever gags, it can be an enjoyable experience--just don't expect too much from it.

This boxed set is a companion to two other boxed sets--the ""Jolly Frolics"" collection of the rest of the UPA theatrical shorts, and ""Mr. Magoo: The Television Collection,"" which includes all of Magoo's television cartoons. Add to this ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" and it makes for a complete set of Magoo's animated appearances.

If you are a fan of Mr. Magoo or UPA, or if you enjoy cartoons that are cleverly written and highly satirical, this collection is one not to be missed.",1400198400,9,3072,5.011764705882353
4932265,5,B0062KMDWU,This is a great collection of shorts where you can see the evolution of the Mr. Magoo character. His original incarnation was radically different from the one we know today. Wonderful restoration of these classic shorts.  This is a must have for Magoo fans and cartoon aficionados.,1399939200,3,281,4.9787234042553195
4932266,4,B0062KMDWU,It's fun to have all the Mr. Magoo cartoons together for the first time in a wonderful box set. Brings back all the movie going memories when cartoons were part of the programs. It is also a very good quality DVD set.,1399852800,4,217,4.190476190476191
4932267,5,B0062KMDWU,"The Theatrical Collection includes 53 color shorts, produced for theaters, from 1949 - 1959. The shorts take up three one-sided discs, while the forth disc is devoted to the long-awaited Mr. Magoo movie, 1001 Arabian Nights. However, they are packaged rather oddly, with the three discs in one snap case, and the film disc in another, both cases sliding into an attractive slip case. Never fear, though, they are safely packaged. Perhaps this was done so that the movie could be released separately. At any rate, the movie disc is loaded with extras, including an interview with Leonard Maltin, a Magoo documentary featuring historians such as Gerry Beck and Darrel Van Citters, and A Princess for Magoo, an early black and white TV teaser for the upcoming film with Jim Backus, voice of Mr. Magoo, as the host.

Needless to say, both the film and the shorts are dazzling. The initial shorts were directed by John Hubley, but most of the later ones are directed by Pete Burness, who also directed a 1952 short in a series of UPA one-offs known as Jolly Frolics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UPA-The-Jolly-Frolics-Collection-DVD/dp/B007L0U1R4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UPA: The Jolly Frolics Collection [DVD</a>]. But the most amazing thing is Jim Backus ad libbing through the shorts, making good use of his sense of humor and voice talent from radio. An early writer was Bill Scott, one of the main writers later on Rocky and Bullwinkle. The Magoo shorts really hit their stride under Burness, with sumptuous colors and modern design from former Disney animators, artists and designers, who eagerly fell in with the modernist motifs of UPA and producer Steven Bosustow. Since the stories are usually so much better, the Magoo shorts are, in many cases, more representative of UPA's intent. This is ironic, as UPA's initial idea was to make every JF short different, with no continuing characters. However, in the process, they created one that is still continuing today.

So popular was Mr. Magoo, that his second full-length movie, Mr, Magoo's Christmas Carol, was the first animated Christmas special (yes, even predating A Charlie Brown Christmas). Darell Van Citters has written a book about it (now unfortunately being scalped for way too much money)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Magoo-s-Christmas-Carol-50th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0615642802/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol, 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition</a>, as well as interviewed principal players on the deluxe DVD reissue&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MR-MAGOO-S-CHRISTMAS-CAROL-2011/dp/B005BYBZPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MR.

As one of the historians says in the documentary, the only thing missing from this Magoo set are the commercials for GE light bulbs, in which Mr. Magoo used to say, ""it's easy to see, the best bulbs are GE.""",1398988800,30,3999,6.657088122605364
4932268,5,B0062KMDWU,"There is just so much in the history of animation! After collecting Warner Brother's Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons recorded from broadcast tv and buying Hanna Barberra's Tom and Jerry mgm cartoons and Max Fleicher's POPEYE cartoons vol 1, 2, and 3 I have FINNALY all of the U.P.A. theatrical MR. MAGOO cartoons in a 4 disc DVD set! If it wasn't for You Tube I would not have seen any of the U.P.A. made for theater cartoons! I had read about their influence on Disney, Warner Brothers and other rival cartoons and I saw TOOT WHISTLE PLUNK AND BOOM the academy award winning short by Disney made in the U.P.A. limited animation style  but it was only in the last few years that I saw any of the original U.P.A. shorts on You Tube! And all of these shorts have been beautifully remastered on both the JOLLY FROLICS DVD SET as well as the MR. MAGOO set It's the one shot cartoons by U.P.A. that got the most praise from the critics with each short being in it's own unique style!  UNICORN IN THE GARDEN was made in the style of N.Y. cartoonist James Thurber while Edger Allen Poe's THE TELL TALE HEART shows it's story from the point of view of the madman with dark stylised human figures and creepy shadows! This same style of artwork was used to begin each episode of Serling's classic TWILIGHT ZONE series in it's first season and U.P.A. is credited with animating this opening title sequence!!

But it's the Mr. Magoo series that was the most popular with 1950s audiences. To me they are much better crafted and written then the cranked out Magoo tv show! RAGTIME BEAR started the series with Magoo being a grouchy old man in a W.C. Fields kind of way who sees the world out of focus but stubbornly refuses to admit that he's wrong about everything around him! He mistakes a banjo playing bear for his human nephew Waldo! Waldo winds up being the victim of his Uncle's nearsightedness. I wind up feeling sorry for Waldo many times through the series!  The next cartoon, SPELLBOUND HOUND has an excaped criminal being persued by a determined bloodhound and Magoo mistakes the dog for his sad faced friend Ralph! A hilarious gag showing Magoo spinning a record turntable like it's an outboard motor on a boat really cracked me up!! Especially when the fast spinning record is playing ""Frankie and Johnny"" at a fast chipmunk sound speed! Of these early Magoo's FUDDY DUDDY BUDDY is one of my favorites with Magoo talking to his old pal Bottomly but then Magoo mistakes a Walrus for his tennis playing friend Bottomly! Well the Walrus's big tusk teeth do look like Bottomly's long white mustache!  This is the one cartoon where Magoo is forced to face his nearsightness when the hotel's  detective tells him,""that walrus is going back to the pond!"" Magoo looked sad and momentarly depressed but then he smiled and said, "" I don't care whether he's a walrus or not, I LIKE HIM!!""

This fine cartoon and others before this one were supervised by animater John Hubley, who had gotten his animation training at Walt Disney. He directed the RITE OF SPRING sequence of FANTASIA, my favorite classic Disney movie!  After the 1941 strike many disney animaters left Walt and went in a modern art direction with backrounds and character design influenced by artists such as Picasso and other abstract  painters. And so U.P.A. was born! The remastering shows off the backround art beautifully with bright swatches of painted color and sponged on paint textures for brick walls. Other favorites on this disc include HOTSY FOOTSEY, CAPTAINS OUTRAGEOUS and MAGOO'S MASTERPIECE. HOTSEY FOOTSEY has Magoo confusing a dance contest with a wrestling match with hilarious results! And seeing Magoo do the Charelston dance while Jim Bacchus sings for Magoo is just hysterical! In CAPTAINS OUTRAGEOUS Magoo is determined to catch the giant sailfish, Mighty Moe! And poor Waldo fell over board and Magoo has mistaken a seal to be Waldo! When the seal catches Mighty Moe by raising the  anchor, hooking the sailfish Magoo of course takes all the credit and poor Waldo was left out on the water on a buoy and he's left out crying for his uncle,""HEY UNK! OH UNK!!!"" Like I said I feel sorry for Waldo!

Like Peter Seller's Inspecter Clousseu, the more Magoo goofs up the better things work out for him in the end! In MAGOO'S MASTERPIECE our nearsighted hero needed to do some sculpting to keep his hands busy at the advice from his docter. So he went to his artist friend's art studio to sculpt, but so has the Spirit criminal to hide from the cops! The Spirit disguised himself as a female model while Magoo got ready to ""capture your Spirit in clay!"" When the police showed up a wild chase ensued and Magoo felt, ""Oh she has fainted!"" and he threw wet plaster of paris on the Spirit to revive ""her"" and thus the Spirit was frozen as a lady statue for the police to take away and Magoo became a hero! Most cartoon characters when they mess up they end up being the losers. Not Magoo!! He wins for himself in spite of his mistakes!  As is the case for any animated series some shorts are better then others but overall this is a funny, cool collection of 53 short subjects!  The last Magoo short on disc 3, TERROR FACES MAGOO is a very funny parody of Ed Murrow's interviews of celebrities in their homes, remember Ed interviewing Ricky Riccardo in his apartment on I LOVE LUCY? But here Ed's cameramen interviewed Mr. Magoo in his mansion while a gorilla was trying to rob the place! Once again comic confusion resulted and Mr. Murrow stated, "" We have to leave now, Mr. Magoo! There's TOO MUCH TOGETHERNESS for us here!"" And Magoo commented, ""I'm sorry Ed, but NOTHING much happens in Magoo Manor!!"" And as Waldo was misstaken for the gorilla by the cops ( Waldo got covered by a bear skin rug) and he was arrested Magoo went back to watching the Tv but it's really the window and the gorilla was there with him as he said,"" you really need to shave Waldo!"" for the punchline!

As an added bonus 1001 ARABIAN NIGHTS, Magoo's first feature film is on the 4th disc! A DVD extra is the black and white movie trailer that shows Katheryn Grant performing her lines at a voice recording for the Princess Yasminda in 1001 ARABIAN NIGHTS. Miss Grant played the Princess in love with Sinbad (Kerwin Mathews) in Ray Harryhausen's THE 7th VOYAGE OF SINBAD! Directer of ARABIAN NIGHTS, Jack Kinney is also shown listening to Katheryn and then watching the finished animation. And Jim Bacchus, voice of Magoo, narrates the trailer while the film shows character sketches and storyboard drawings of Princess Yasminda! Nice behind the scences peek of making of the movie!

It really made a differance seeing this movie on DVD without commercial interuption and uncut! I especially enjoyed the confrontation of Magoo(Jim Bachcus)  and the Wicked Wazir (Hans Conreid) Both of those stars were old radio veterans so there was very good comic sparks between them! Apparently the handsome Alladin had a much better time with his Uncle Magoo then poor Waldo! It's obvious that the Disney Corporation ""ripped off"" art design ideas and character designs for their ALLADIN movie! Disney's Alladin and Princess Jasmine are closely similar to U.P.A.s Alladin and Princess Yasminda in both character design and costume, perhaps similar enough for U.P.A., if they existed today, to sue Disney enterprises for copyright infringement! I say ""ripped off"" since I have NO RESPECT for the ""New"" Disney!! I prefer the Genie in this U.P.A. film over the Robin Williams, run off with the mouth genie in Disney's ALLADIN!! The U.P.A. Genie looks like a huge, giant Sumo Wrestler!! Well that was a lot for me to say! Highly recommended! Now if the MGM Barney Bear cartoons DVDS would be released!",1398643200,8,7744,4.691458026509573
4932269,5,B0062KMDWU,"The release of Shout Factorys ""Mr. Magoo: The Theatrical Collection"" is a cause for celebration. Its been delayed for almost two years now (when I was driving home through New Jersey with one of the people who worked on transferring the negatives, he indicated that the work had been completely done ages ago), but whatever the circumstances were, its out and a purchase is in order.

I detect no vandalism to the cartoons Ive viewed thus far in the way of DNR or aspect ratio distortion. Everything looks excellent and uncensored. THESE, not the TV cartoons, are the Magoo cartoons you want: the ones that won acclaim and awards and cemented the character's popularity in the first place. The bonuses are first-rate, and the inclusion of ""1001 Arabian Nights"" was welcome.

This took a long time to come out... so grab your copy before it goes away again!",1398124800,25,856,4.777027027027027

I was excited to hear that the theatrical shorts were coming to dvd because I heard they are far superior to the tv ones. Knowing my package was coming today, I actually kept looking out for the mailman, such was my excitement. Well, the excitement was justified. I am loving each short I see. The tv Magoo shorts can't touch these original theatricals. I am extremely pleased with this set and every Mr. Magoo fan needs to add it to their collection.",1398124800,18,594,4.36036036036036

4932273,5,B0062KMDWU,When I was kid I might have watched Tom and Jerry. Whether I did or didn't I don't remember. I do remember watching Woody Woodpecker Looney Tunes with Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck Porky Pig Tweety Pie and Sylvester Wile E Coyote and The Roadrunner Elmer Fudd Yosemite Sam and everybody else on that show and The Pink Panther. Later my brother got me interested in Yogi Bear and that was added to the list. I wish Id watched Mr Magoo which unlike Tom and Jerry I know I never watch at least not as a kid. Ironicly I first heard of Mr Magoo when I first heard of Jim Backus the name of the guy who did his voice. Later I was shocked to discover I already knew who he was because he also played Thurston Howell III on Gilligans Island. Two years ago I got the TV shows he did and they're all hilirias.  Unfortunatelly one isn't as good as the other two because they took away the premise of him being so nearsighted that it almost gets him into trouble and everybody around him is either scared for him or themselves and in some cases both. Theese movies are just as good because they led to the TV shows and you should get them.,1391299200,3,1119,4.180555555555555

Extras will include commentaries, pencil tests, and more! Your Golden Age cartoon collection won't be complete without this so get yours today!

UPDATE: 4/14/12
Alot are probably asking, what happen to thier order. Well, the set has been delayed to late fall but for good reasons; The folks are going the extra mile to restore the cartoons from higher quality source materials (plus newly discovered elements!). In other words, it'll be worth the wait soon. So the item will be back to pre-order soon.
