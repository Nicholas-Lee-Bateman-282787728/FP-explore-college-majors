To my relief,this disc plays in my blu ray without issues,looks good and ~YES ~the subtitles work and are legible!  Only one oddity: with the exception of the movie trailer, I couldn't get any of the bonus features to work in my Panasonic blu ray player. It doesn't really matter to me because the extras don't have English subtitles . Nevertheless, I was going to give them a quick look.
And a brief review of the film :
It is entertaining and Dewaere is electric. The films treatment of sexual assault is uuncomfortable to watch. I'm not entirely sure if we're rooting for Dewaere' s character or not, but we certainly aren't rooting for any of the people who oppose him. Ultimately I found the ending satisfying and somewhat sweet,although I didn't find the ""revenge "" to be all that effective, unlike other viewers. Dewaere's Perrin gets a happy ending and we're glad to see it.",1441670400,,1008,4.6
