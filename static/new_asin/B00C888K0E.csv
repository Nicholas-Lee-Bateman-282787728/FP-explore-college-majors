5697189,5,B00C888K0E,"Having seen many Holocaust docs over the years (like so many of us), along comes this INCREDIBLE story that I had never heard about before, and it is told quite beautifully here. ""Defiant Requiem"" is an amazing story of the Nazi concentration camp at Terezin, wherein many talented Czech artists were imprisoned - and it specifically tells the story of one Czech composer, Raphael Schchter, who's idea it was to lead a performance of Verdi's ""Requiem"" inside the camp. And it tells the parallel story of music conductor Murry Sidlin who decades later went back to Terezin specifically to perform ""Requiem"" again, quite beautifully, this time with survivors from the camp. I don't really have the words - let me just say this story was completely new to me and had a profound impact on me, particularly the incredible interviews with the survivors.

It's such a profound experience to be educated on something completely new relating to the Holocaust, and for the subject matter to be told with such depth and compassion, but also restraint. The story was sensational enough, the filmmakers wisely chose not to be manipulative (which would have been easy in this case) - they just told you and showed you this story with honesty, clarity and genuine beauty.... This is what true documentary filmmaking should always be like.

SEE this film, you won't regret it!!",1376697600,24,1361,4.93886462882096
5697190,5,B00C888K0E,"I saw it on TV. Let me say, this is NOT for faint hearts. As well, unless you're some sort of unfeeling clod, you'll need handkerchiefs.

Here's the thing: JEWS are singing - and gloriously - Verdi's Requiem, Requiem, Requiem. OMG. I've started to weep again, for their faith, their humanity amongst the hideous tortures and killing of CHRISTIANS who just KNOW that Jews killed Jesus instead of the Romans. Good God!

Will I ever watch it again? I've recorded it. Maybe. Maybe not. But I hope that as many people who have the stomach for raw suffering will stay the course and celebrate the courage of those people who were offered few choices.",1368316800,7,644,4.640350877192983

5697214,5,B00C888K0E,"This is a fascinating movie very worth the watch.  It was a story of the Holocaust that we had never heard, and as a family of musicians, it tore at our hearts.  It is hard to stomach, as with all Holocaust stories, yet one that needed to be told.  It's not for chidlren -- at least not young ones -- and certainly something to be watched under supervision for all the questions that will arise.  Everyone, everywhere, needs to know as much about the valiant ones who survived to tell the stories with so much dignity.  This should be a ""must see"" movie for all college music students.",1424476800,,585,4.37962962962963

5697218,2,B00C888K0E,"I have read and seen so much about the holocaust I am fairly critical.  The film was beautiful and based on some truth, but what I missed was information about the concentration camp itself, how it was different from other camps.  I know from my reading that it was the camp for the so called upper-class Jews.  No effort was made in the film to establish that fact.  For example, where did the orchestra get their instruments?  How did they pay for them?  How were their lives different from those of people in the other camps?  By not giving us this information I think many viewers would think this camp was like the others except for this musical group, which is not true.  The Jews there were almost hand-picked and treated much better.  The film appeared ""contrived"" to me--untruthful.  Definitely incomplete coverage of life in a concentration camp.",1408060800,,856,4.722972972972973

5697231,5,B00C888K0E,"A great video for anyone who wants to understand the tremendous heroism of Jews in the concentration camps. They were defiant and courageous in hundreds of subtle ways, and perhaps the most powerful way was in the production of the Requiem Mass under the most difficult of circumstances.",1405296000,,287,5.0
5697232,5,B00C888K0E,"This documentary relays the bold move of Raphael Sch&auml;chter, a Czech composer imprisoned in the Concentration Camp of Terezin.  In order to give the other prisoners hope in the face of the unknown, he formed a chorus and along with trumpter and taught the prisoner's one of the most difficult Latin compositions, Verdi's ""Requiem"".  ""Requiem"" is about the God's judgment and wrath which will come to oppressors.  Using only one sheet of music to teach them, the prisoners would gather for several hours at night in a cold basement to learn each word and note, a tremendous undertaking.  The few survivors that were either part of this choral group and those who escaped death while being held at Terezin give their impressions of the experience.  It became for many their sole motivation to survive the horrid conditions and despair of constant hunger, separations and death of loved ones and friends.

Murry Sidlin, a brilliant conductor came up with the idea to commemorate this incredible act of sedition by forming a new choir along with an orchestra, which practiced for a year before traveling to Camp Terezin (now abandoned) and perform Verdi's Requiem as a Memorial to all the great composers from Czechoslovakia (then a cultural center for music in Europe) as well as all camp survivors and the originator Raphael Sch&auml;chter.

Some of the participants in the new choir actually are the children of camp survivors (who are interviewed).  Additionally, there were three original camp choral participants, who shared their memories of that time.  A total of five survivor's participant in this riveting documentary.

This documentary was very moving, I teared up throughout the viewing.  If you are looking to expand your understanding of the survival mentality, this is an awesome exploration.

I wish that the entire requiem would have been shown (at the very least as an optional supplement) to the documentary, since it was shown in pieces.",1404604800,5,1958,5.103448275862069
5697233,5,B00C888K0E,"""A Defiant Requiem"" is an extremely moving and poignant documentary of the treatment of the Jewish people during the Holocaust.

5697234,5,B00C888K0E,"This film caught me up in all the horror of the death camps and the whole point that when there are not words to describe the happening around one, that music  is the vehicle to express everything. It spurred me on to read Eichmann's Inferno Auschwitz.",1391558400,4,252,4.478260869565218
5697235,2,B00C888K0E,"We had hoped to see actual footage of the Jewish Orchestra's performance and its participants. Instead  we are given war documentary film background, a survivor's reminiscence, and a totally irrelevant modern performance of Verdi's Requiem.

5697237,4,B00C888K0E,"A documentary about a well covered era, but the subject matter was not well known to me. The tenacity to live, to live up to one's purpose, to hold on to one's faith in spite of such oppression, darkness, hopelessness is amazing. To be able to inspire it in others is beyond amazing. I am so glad that conductor Murry Sidlin was possessed to bring about this awesome tribute to the people who lived through the events and to bring Conductor Rafael Schacter's life to our consciousness. His bold defiance in face of oppressors gave his fellow captives the courage to use their inner strength to stand up in dignity. Not only defying cruelty but proving to themselves and us that each and every human life is worth while and we should never forget.
The work is very well done, not clinical yet not maudlin. A work that we will watch many times.",1387065600,2,842,4.509803921568627
5697238,5,B00C888K0E,"This is a rare evidence of human power and strength to resist oppression by Nazi invaders in a ghetto Terezin, where prisoners were held helpless and intimidated. They used the glorious music of Verdi's Requiem and latin language to disquise the harsh meaning of the words which predicted death and destruction to the murderers and oppressors. The mass was prepared by a professional musician who rehearsed the singing with ordinary prisoners under the harshest circumstances and conditions during WWII in a celar with just a broken piano. This is a document of human courage to fight even if there is no hope of achieving freedom. Most of the original participants were murdered during the war years.",1386720000,9,701,5.051724137931035
5697239,2,B00C888K0E,"I had the privilege of attending a live concert of the Defiant Requiem. It was an outstanding experience - very charged, very emotional. I thought it a very fine tribute to the greatness of the human spirit and of course - to Verdi's masterpiece. I bought this DVD expecting it to be a live recording of one of the performances. Instead I found a rather dry documentary about the life in Terezin, and next to nothing about Murry Sidlin's wonderful project. With all due respect - I've seen many documentaries about The Holocaust and about musicians in Terezin, (one such musician was a friend of my family), but Mr. Sidlin's project is unique, and deserve a full recording. This DVD was a great disappointment to me, and I have to say I found its title quite misleading.",1383868800,4,770,4.627737226277373
5697240,5,B00C888K0E,"This is a piece of history that seems little known.  As a practicing music therapist, this confirms the work I do with music.  It is a universal language, and whole brain activity that may assist people through the deepest trauma.  ""Defiant Requiem"" is similar to ""Road to Paradise"" about the women's camps run by the Japanese, and the ""orchestra"" that one camp had of women's voices. Music welled up as strong medicine during these times. Requiem is very disturbing on the one hand, but demonstrates resolve and the fact that individuals who have everything taken away still have the choice of how they will act in response.",1382659200,8,625,4.822429906542056

This film overwhelmed me at their courage, their love for life, making something good out of horrific horror.  Everyone should get this and have their children, grandchildren, and friends watch it, so we as individuals can be encouraged to overcome our small misfortunes, and live a more meaningful life not centered around things, but focusing on being a good neighbor.
