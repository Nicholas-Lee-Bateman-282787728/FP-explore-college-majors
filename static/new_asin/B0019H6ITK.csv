Maybe it'd be too weird if this one had a real bathing suit in it :P But in its defense I'd have to say this one has my favorite CD, although it gets a lot of competition from Volume 1 but is my favorite as it's easier on the ear.

Well worth the price",1247011200,,402,3.8433734939759034
3437350,4,B0019H6ITK,"Volume one of ""Lucky Star"" was a hit-and-miss comedy effort, but the second volume adds in far more funny anime reference jokes.

""Lucky Star"" isn't an original series--it features mostly anime parody jokes which are only funny if people have seen the anime series which the parodies are based on. Thankfully, ""Lucky Star"" sneaks in some very funny inside references to anime.

For starters, in episode six Konata's cousin, Yui Narumi, gets steamed as another driver passes her car on the freeway. She then engages the person in an adrenaline-pumpking Initial D-style race--at 45 miles per hour. Talk about heavily dramatized.

Konata's teacher Nanako also has a sneaky inside reference to Evangelion. At a table at the beach, she drinks a beer and she says the trademark ""CAAH! This is delicious!"" quote from Misaki at the apartment.

Okay, maybe that joke is a little too elusive for other anime watchers to catch. However, ""Lucky Star"" flourishes in these silly inside references and parodies.

Even funnier are Konata's breaks in the middle of her homework to play her MMORPG. Konata has some humorous chats with her teacher in the MMORPG, who keeps reminding her to do her homework. However, sometimes Konata just HAPPENS to find a rare drop item in the game, and has to spend a special all-nighter trying out the new item. Good grief.

There's also plenty of great references to ""Maria Watches Over Us,"" about Catholic girls appointed as the special ""little sisters"" to senior girls. And just for kicks, ""Lucky Star"" adds in a sneaky reference to ""Azumanga Daioh"" in the form of a relay race.

And while not everyone will get these jokes, ""Lucky Star"" is a special series for trying every single parody joke that anyone could ever think of. Sometimes the jokes don't work, but in this series, volume two is the beginning of ""Lucky Star"" at its prime.",1246320000,,1856,4.873015873015873
3437351,5,B0019H6ITK,"The second volume fulfills the potential of the series, unlike the first four episodes. We get more than just talking heads in this volume, the girls get out and around and we meet their families and friends. This is a fun series with superior animation and voice acting. Each of the characters portrays a stereotypical Japanese school-girl role, but Konata seems aware of the stereotypes, and is constantly commenting on how often Miyuki lives up to her ""Moe"" sterotypical role. She seems unaware, however, of the sideways looks her own relationship with her single father garners from her friends, who are concerned that Konata and her father are a little ""too close"". When they wear kimonos to a Shrine festival, the girls notice Konata wears a real tied obi sash, and not a fake ""pre-tied"" obi. Konata innocently comments that her father tied the obi for her, and the girls all have an ""ick"" moment where they wonder what sort of man knows how to tie a girl's obi. It's all played for laughs, however, nothing inappropriate is shown or mentioned. The first volume nearly had me clicking on the merchandise return link. This second volume redeemed the series for me.",1222387200,2,1169,4.82089552238806
3437352,5,B0019H6ITK,"The series continues to make me laugh on multiple levels and every time I rewatch it I find something new that I missed before. While someone can't stress enough how much of a niche title this is, you equally cannot stress enough that this is comic gold. The jokes are well paced, the characters are all appealing in their various roles and dialogue really keeps your attention. If you call yourself otaku, then it's hard to see how you could pass this one up.",1220313600,,460,4.488095238095238
3437353,5,B0019H6ITK,"Lucky Star is an excellent show. Illustrating the life of Konata, and her friends. Mainly because original manga was 4 panels kind, it still makes sense even if you don't watch the whole thing in one sitting. Story other than main theme and scenes do not rely much on other part, making it relatively light one to watch. Characters are varied enough more likely you will find at least one character you'll like in the show.

Comes with quite a bit of bonus, which I think is on per with its price tag. If you just want DVD, you can get that way too. (CDs are nice, but I have hard time imagining myself wearing the T-shirt...)

Overall quality of dub is decent, but it is not certainly best one in my opinion. It is somewhat unfortunate as dubs for some characters are perfect. I'm not evaluating subtitles, as I watch Japanese track without one.

You might not get the full idea of humors in the show, if you don't know the original of those came from. Luckly, DVD insert includes information about background information about jokes and humors in the show.",1218153600,5,1058,4.5
3437354,4,B0019H6ITK,"So i just got this, and i am for the most part, very happy with it.

You can't go wrong with a swimsuit t-shirt (although nobody i know would be seen dead with me wearing it) and the CD is awesome. Unfortunately less free stuff than the first special edition but beggars cant be choosers and to be perfectly honest, a small quantity of bonus merchandise is better than none.

My only realy problem with this is unlike the first volume that came in an awesome sturdy thick-card box with a little door in it to get the stuff out, they kind of cheaped out on this one and put it all into a very flimsy cardboard box with less cool artwork on it.

But its still awesome and if you were wondering if you should buy this or the regular version, i would fully recommend spending the extra.",1216252800,3,782,4.23489932885906
3437355,5,B0019H6ITK,Lucky Star is an amazing 26 episodes-long anime that aired in Japan last year. Thank you Bandai for bringing it over with this overwhelming quality and great extras!,1215216000,5,165,4.928571428571429
3437356,5,B0019H6ITK,"This is my first review in Amazon, so I'm going to try to be as thorough and clear as possible. Instead of reviewing the show, I'm going to review the package, because let's face it, if you're thinking about buying this, you've already made your mind up about the show, and are just thinking if it's worth it to buy the Limited Edition.

Well, that's what I'm here for. I pre-ordered this item and I received it on July 1.

This, like the other collaborative releases by Bandai Entertainment and Kadokawa Pictures USA, is a superb package. These people really know their fan-base; what they desire. The set comes in a cardboard box, that temporarily holds the DVDs (and bonus items) for easy shipping. I use the term ""temporarily"" very loosely. Very likely, you won't get rid of that box, because of the art that adorns it.

The DVD case itself, like the Vol. 1 case, comes in a basic white color, made to look like notebook paper. This time with a very basic drawing of Tsukasa in a Shrine Maid outfit. This, like the volume before and the volumes to follow, is Konata's drawing, and it suits the case wonderfully. The contents of the DVD is the basic fare: Dolby Digital Audio in both Japanese and English; full subtitles and/or sign subtitles. The extras are a bit weak, however, with only the Key Scenes gallery, and a couple (I think three) episodes of ""The Adventures of Minoru Shiraishi"" (of which, by the way, I've never seen a single episode).

Of course, the above (except for the ""temporary box"") is included in the standard edition, so it's time to get into the bonus items not included anywhere else.

Sadly, there's one less extra here than in the Vol. 1 LE. If you remember, Vol. 1 had the Chocolate Coronet monitor wipe. It would have been nice if this included something similar. Breaking it down, we have:

Vol. 1:
1. Konata Character CD
2. Opening Music CD (doesn't count for the comparison)
3. Box for the entire set (doesn't count for the comparison)
4. Uniform-print shirt
5. Choco Coronet monitor wipe

Vol. 2:
1. Kagami Character CD
2. Bathing suit-print shirt

As you can see, Vol. 2 doesn't have an equivalent for the monitor wipe. Really. Not even a small plushie to hang on one's cellular phone.

However, what it does include is simply fantastic. The Kagami CD really brings a new light about Kagami that I hadn't completely realized until I heard it. It features five tracks. The first two are songs, as performed by Kagami; the last two are the instrumental versions of the songs; and the third track is Kagami... talking. Sadly, I don't understand Japanese, so I don't know what she's saying.

The shirt is also a very comfortable shirt. It's of good quality, or at least it certainly feels like it is. Some fans, especially the male ones, may feel a bit weird wearing it, though. I, on the other hand, quite enjoyed wearing the shirts (both this and the uniform-print one), they're simply too comfortable.

So my final word: Very highly recommended for anyone who wants to buy Vol. 2. For the price, it's a steal in and of itself. If you're a Lucky Star fan, don't get caught without this package!",1215129600,17,3130,4.6014362657091565
3437357,5,B0019H6ITK,"If I was going to describe Lucky Star in one sentence to someone with no previous knowledge of anime, I'd say it's as if the shows Seinfeld and Best Week Ever had a love child, and in there shame sent it off to Japan to be raised by the maker of Azumanga Daioh. Thankfully, I can make use of more than a single sentence.

Lucky Star follows the lives of four teenage girls with various personalities as they go through there daily lives as japanese high school students. Coming from traditional four panel comic strips (yonkoma) like the above mentioned Azumanga, there's no real continuous plot. However, the main draw of the series is the focus on the lead heroine Konata Izumi, who in japanese would be considered an otaku, while in ye olde english she can simply be called an anime nerd. Through Miss Konata we are given a series of anime inside jokes and japanese pop culture reference. And that's basically it, the whole series.

Though the above statement might seem as if I'm being hatefully critical, in actuality it's the complete opposite. I love everything about this series. True it isn't very complex, but that's what makes it so enjoyable. The characters are very simple, but have just enough depth so that they're all so lovable. The animation isn't ground breaking, but it's bright, colorful, and portrays the cute fun the writers were aiming for. And the music also conveys adorableness with everything from the main title song, to little background diddies enjoyably getting stuck in your head. While it's nice to have epic stories, major plot twists, and emotional characters, Lucky Star is a pleasant departure into simple animated fun.

However, Lucky Star is not without it's faults. The problem with pop culture comedy is if you don't know the reference of the joke you completely miss the punch line. This isn't a major issue because even if you don't understand why everyone's laughing, you'll still manage to get a few giggle if only out of confusion. Also each DVD includes a cheat sheet explaining all the little nuances of each episode. My main complaint isn't with the anime, but with the DVD itself. Its utter lack in special feature is very disappointing to me, seeing as I'm a sucker for commentaries and the such. Also, since when did interactive menus become special features as the box depicts. In this day and age saying a DVD has interactive menus is like say the disc will be round. But, I digress.

Some might argue that the dubbing is another deduction on the DVDs behalf, but I strongly disagree. Although I did already watch the whole series in the original japanese with bootleg-o-vision, it was easy to quickly warm up to the english voice actresses (and the very few actors). For those who do want to enjoy the original dubbing, or those who are too stubborn to listen to anything else, they do have original japanese with english subtitles. I recommend watching both as each has there merits.

Many have said that Lucky Star isn't for everyone, which I whole heartedly agree. Go read some more reviews, learn more about it, and see if it's up your ally. You just might find something truly enjoyable.

I also love the series because it just low key and cute.

3437364,4,B0019H6ITK,"The appeal of this anime lies in the cute character designs and the dialogue. Not very much actually happens here. It's mainly just the characters sitting around and talking to each other. But their conversations and personalities make the show pretty funny. There is a character in this series that is obsessed with the Haruhi Suzumiya anime. I think that's kinda funny since the voice actor was the same as in that series too. There's not really much to tell about Lucky Star, but even if that's true it's still pretty cute and funny. You may like if you give it a shot.",1351728000,,572,4.563106796116505

3437366,4,B0019H6ITK,"Lucky Star is funny, very cute, and for fans of anime and manga.  Really, if you don't have a collection of anime you may not even understand some of the jokes.  Even the liner notes may not make any sense.  Still, there is lots of humor for anybody's taste, from swimsuit fan service to tons of silliness.  The extras on the DVD are nice but the episodes are the meat and potatoes of the show and you may end up watching it more than once just to enjoy what you missed the first time.  Also one of the only anime I listen to in Japanese afterwards because sometimes it is easier to figure out the humor with the subtitles.
I suggest it for anybody who loves good, old fashion silly humor and does not need explosions, robots or gun fights to enjoy their anime.",1268697600,,761,4.256944444444445
