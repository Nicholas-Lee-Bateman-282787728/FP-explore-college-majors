8534085,2,B0091ELPUK,"These subtitles were generated using an inferior bablefish/automatic translating program.  They flat out don't give you more than the roughest idea of what's going on.

If you want to know the plot, you can TRY finding the comic or animated ""Future Diary"" (also known as ""Mirai Nikki"") but the plot is altered.

...and the subtitles are flat-out insanely illiterate.  I'm considering turning them off and just trying to make it through on facial expressions and tone of voice.

Assuming you're not good at Japanese or a big fan, look for a fansub, or just skip to the manga or anime.",1387152000,,583,4.79
8534086,1,B0091ELPUK,"The English subtitles are laughably bad! I can't really comment on the series beyond that. I don't speak Japanese. It might have been a great show, but the subs look like someone just ran some text through BabbleFish and called it a day.",1369440000,3,237,4.534883720930233
