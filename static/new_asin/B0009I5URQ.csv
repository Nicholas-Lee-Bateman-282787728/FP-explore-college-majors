8061226,5,B0009I5URQ,I thought this was pure cheese at first but my son and daughter (4 & 2) LOVE LOVE LOVE Wai Lana's little yogis dvd and I admit some of the poses are really challenging! This is fun to do together.,1415923200,,196,3.925

She was born with Down syndrome and has hypotonia (low muscle tone). She LOVE LOVE LOVES doing Yogi and we LOVE LOVE LOVE that it helps to strengthen her muscles while she's doing something she enjoys! Last summer we misplaced her DVD and have finally gotten around to ordering another one along with Volume 2. Thank you Wailana & Little Yogis!!",1325548800,4,762,8.083333333333334
8061228,5,B0009I5URQ,"Love love love Little Yogis.  It seems a little cheesy to a grown up at first but my 2 yr old loves the songs, animation, and attempting the yoga moves.  You're never too young to do a little yoga.  Mommy enjoys the time to practice yoga too.  Get it!",1312416000,,251,4.061224489795919
8061229,4,B0009I5URQ,We have a mildly autistic boy and he loves these videos.  The thing he likes the best is that he can make his own workout routine from the DVD as well.  This helps him to relax some and relieves a little tension.,1311465600,,212,4.023809523809524
8061230,4,B0009I5URQ,"I recieved the wai lana little yogis kit and daydream kit as part of my children's yoga teacher training course materials.  They are great!!!

My 18 month old fell in love with the videos and asks for them several times a day.  He plots down on his bum and imitates it as well as he can.  My two year old is a little less interested in doing the poses but still loves to watch the video.

At first I was a little put off by her makeup and outfit (very bright) but it's done for the kids and they love it!!!

Daydream is a meditation video and they love watching it in the evening to relax at the end of the day or listen to the cd while we make up our own poses.

It lost a star because we use a playstation 2 to play the movies so the center hole clips on to the disk reader.  The holes in the center of the disks were defectivly small so after a few months of use the center began to crack and chip so they no longer will play for us.  But we will be replacing them.

If you're serious about teaching your kids yoga, get the full kits (listed as books on amazon).  They are worth it.  Great pictures, instructions, stickers, they're great!

And remember, it takes most kids sitting through 3 full yoga classes to begin to participate so don't give up too quickly.  And they are adult yoga moves made interesting to kids, so don't be afraid to join in, get a workout while you're at it.",1168646400,9,1387,4.088888888888889
