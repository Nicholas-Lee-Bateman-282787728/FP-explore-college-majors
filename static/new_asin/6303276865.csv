614083,2,6303276865,Wcw decided to try something new in 93 when everything was going bad for them and this was one of the things. A terrible card with a decent main event but having the british bulldog main event for a wcw title on a major  ppv should not happen especially only this far in his career. Rest of the  card is throwaway.,935107200,,314,4.131147540983607

7842309,2,6303276865,These early wcw releases were released via crappy recording methods. It's impossible to get it to play normal there's always lines somewhere on the screen and jumpy.. this is for all early wcw tapes feom this time in 93 94 I don't know about 95 but the tapes are crappy they use ep mode I believe which is the worst. Ted turner was a cheapskate,1431993600,,344,4.3076923076923075
7842310,3,6303276865,"The Legends 6 man tag team match between the team of Dick Murdoch,Don Muraco & Jimmy Snuka against the team of Wahoo McDaniel,Blackjack Mulligan & Jim Brunzell was not great but actually pretty fun. The tag team match between Ivan Koloff & Baron Von Rashchke against Thunderbolt Patterson & Brad Armstrong was crud. The Dory Funk Jr-Nick Bockwinkel match was a very good technical bout. The tag team match between Rick Rude & Paul Orndorff against Dustin Rhodes & Kensuke Sasaki was pretty uninspired but expected under the circumstances. The match between Sting & The Prisoner was trash. The cage match for World Tag Team titles between The Hollywood Blondes & Dos Hombres was not great but pretty good. The NWA World title match between Barry Windham & Arn Anderson was solid to say the least. The WCW World title match between Big Van Vader & Davey Boy Smith was a good power bout even with the stupid finish at the end. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1348963200,,954,4.584795321637427
7842311,3,6303276865,"This review is really of the actual PPV, which I still have in its original form on VHS. I don't know what the Turner Home Entertainment version has on it. This event was original dedicated to the legends of pro wrestling and had many future stars on here. This is what I remember from memory:

2 Cold Scorpio & Marcus Bagwell Vs. ""Beautiful"" Bobby Eaton & Chris Benoit - This was 1993 and while Bobby Eaton was nearing the end of his career, the other three in this match were at or not too far from the beginning of theirs. We pretty much know what happened to all of them (particularly Benoit) so no need to rehash.

To the match itself, it was a good opener with rivals Scorpio and Benoit starting it off. Nasty ending when 2 Cold attempted a twisting summersault into a legdrop on Benoit but landed a**-first on Benoit's face! Ouch! Talk about a botched spot!? Anyway, it ended after that part.

Dick Murdoch, Don Muraco & ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka Vs. Jim Brunzell, Wahoo McDaniel and Blackjack Mulligan - This six man was the first of three matches with legends of the game! Two of which (McDaniel and Murdoch) are no longer with us at the time I write this. Not a good six man but considering their ages at this point, I am amazed they could do what they did do! Ends in a double DQ when it got all out of control!

""Thunderbolt"" Patterson & Brad Armstrong Vs. Baron Von Rashke & Ivan Koloff - Probably the best of the legends matches as Patterson was comical in some of his moves! Brad, by the way, was a fill in for his father ""Bullet"" Bob Armstrong who couldn't make it due to an injury. Ends when Patterson got in his pattened double chop to the throat of Rashke for the pin.

Nick Bockwinkle Vs. Dory Funk, Jr. - In sort of an AWA Vs. NWA match, Bockwinkle took on the more saner of the Funk Brothers with respective cornermen. Verne Gange for Bockwinkle and the late Gene Kinski for Funk. The match, for the most part, was clean and was mostly wrestling. Ended in a draw.

Sting Vs. The Prisoner (Nailz for WWE fans) - Not a good match at all. Pretty much a throw away. By the way, Sting won.

""Mr. Wonderful"" Paul Orndorff & ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude Vs. Dustin Rhodes & Kensuki Sasaki - Pretty good tag team encounter. A bit sloppy at times but it especially picked up when Rhodes and the late Rick Rude got it on! Ends when Rude gets in his pattened ""Rude Awakening"" neckbreaker on Sasaki for the pin.

The Hollywood Blondes (""Stunning"" Steve Austin & the late Brian Pillman) Vs. Ricky Steamboat & ""Shane Douglas"" (cage match for the WCW/NWA World Tag Team Titles) - I put Shane in quotation marks because it wasn't actually Douglas in that match. It was actually Tom Zenk (I think) playing Douglas due to the fact that Shane was fired prior to this bout. I do know it wasn't Douglas in the match though he is credited for it.

Anyway, it was still a good match which was more of a display for Austin and Pillman. At that time, I really didn't appreciate the Blondes but now I agree that they definitely didn't get the shot they deserved and WCW was dumb to split them up! One high spot was Steamboat using his famous flying body press on both Austin and Pillman at the same time and nearly pinning them both! Ends when Austin used his Stun Gun to drop Zenk into both the top rope and I believe part of the cage! Great match.

Barry Windham Vs. Arn Anderson (NWA World Title Match) - A classic NWA style match with both men taking punishment from the other. Windham, by the way, bleeds like a pig in this one! Ends when Windham clobbers Anderson with his NWA title belt while the ref is down, winning this battle of former Horsemen.

Vader Vs. ""The British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith (WCW World Title Match) - Was a pretty good bout but the best parts of this match is within the first 10 minutes. Impressive shows of strength by Davey Boy Smith in this one as he used his vertical suplex and even lifted Vader in the ""electric chair""! Remember, Vader (at this time) was 450lbs. so this wasn't no easy feat by any means!

It ends when Vader, after nearly being pinned by Davey but saved by Harley Race, hits The Bulldog with a chair causing a DQ.

Overall, not a bad card but it wasn't a classic. Best bouts were the cage match along with Anderson Vs. Windham. Not a must buy but not a bad buy either.",1227225600,2,4309,4.331265508684863
7842312,5,6303276865,"Don't let the Twentieth Century Jazz Master fool you. These are the Ralph Gleason Jazz Casual Shows from San Francisco. As there is little on video of these two brilliant saxophonists, this will have to do. The Art Pepper Biography, Jazz Survivor is really worth seeing for his humanity and later period music than this. As to Mulligan, this at least is with Bob Brookmeyer his  valve trombone partner who sounds like no other trombonist and swings like Mulligan. Buy it.",1189209600,7,471,4.814814814814815
7842313,4,6303276865,"I guess if WWE 24/7 doesn't show this, and you can find it for a good price, and you didn't watch WCW back early 90's, then this pay per view wouldn't be a bad thing to check out.  You can learn a lot from it if you didn't know what WCW was like back then.

True to early WCW style, very few of the matches have any buildup at all going into them.  Since this pay per view is called ""A Legend's Reunion,"" it's mostly just old guys from different feds fighting each other.  Superfly, Dory Funk Jr., and a whole bunch of other legends are in the matches; plus there's a great tag title cage match, and Barry Windam defending his NWA title (I believe) against Arn Anderson.  Great talent.

Zbysko makes a chillingly accurate prediction regarding the wrestling future of Stunning Steve Austin in this one.  Very odd indeed.

I thought the main event between Vader and the Bulldog was excellent, even though there wasn't a clean win due to a chairshot from Vader.  These two guys were always good against each other, even though such a circumstance was very rare, and I didn't even know Bulldog was in WCW at this point.

I think this tape shows what WCW did best.  Instead of gimmicks and storylines and things like that, there's just a bunch of traditional (not hardcore) wrestling.  It's like watching WCW Saturday Night, but without any jobbers.  Good stuff for old-school fans.

Nobody ever said WCW was great at marketing.  The tape's package contains very little information, and shows pictures of guys who aren't involved in the event.  When you're selling a pay per view on video, you're supposed to put the card on the package.  That's just a no-brainer.  Otherwise you're implying that you have a really crummy card that you're too embarassed to show (which was probably often the case with WCW).

WCW is dead for a reason, but this tape isn't it.  I recommend Slamboree '93.  It's Goldberg-free.",1153699200,,1902,4.601190476190476
7842314,4,6303276865,"The Tag Title steel Cage was ok,The Rude/Ordorff Vs Rhodes/Kensaki was good,The Sting/Nailz was horrible but the World Title match was sorry since it didn't end cleanly but
Vader had to get himself DQ'd to keep the Belt.",999129600,,220,4.815789473684211
7842315,2,6303276865,"OK usually I'm pretty cool with the classic WCW, I consider myself pretty educated after some 13 years of following sports entertainment, but this is a little steep, first off look at the cover, the legend himself rick flair right?  He's not even on the video!, and Dusty Rhodes either.  The highlight of this whole video is Austin and Pillman (halloywood blondes) vs steamboat and roma in the cage, and rude and orndorf vs dustin, not dusty-rhodes and some other guy.  The rest is kind of week, the legends matches are nastolgic but extremely hard on the eyes, the bulldbog vs vader in the main event is a less than stellar affair, and the absolute worst match on the PPV is Sting vs the coonvict, or ""nailz"".  Sting is a guy that can have a good matchwith just about anybody, but with ""nailz"" its a different story, sting literally puts over a guy who's arsenal consists of chokes and more chokes, this goes on for about 15 minutes all the while ""nailz"" is spiting all over the place, its no wonder why WCW canned him right after this PPV.  The crowd which literally consists of half empty seats really don't into this PPV at all, I would recommend Spring Stampede 93 if you want classic WCW.",995673600,,1194,4.5092592592592595
7842316,5,6303276865,What an event it starts off a bit slow with the legends reunion which is the first 3 matches after that u get ravishing rick rude and paul orndorff battle against dustin rhodes and his japanese friend in a brilliant encounter. Then its the hall of fame ceremony where 4 legends get inducted. Then Sting battles The Prisoner in a true battle to the finish. Next up a WCW Tag Team Title match inside a steel cage which pits the champions Steve Austin and Brian Pillman against Rickey Steamboat andShane Douglas. Then the NWA World Title is up for grabs as Arn Anderson challenges Barry Whindum. And the best is left for last a WCW World Title defense by Vader against The British Bulldog is one of the best matches i have ever seen. WCW SLAMBOREE 1993 A LEGENDS REUNION is one of the best PPV ever in wrestling history. BUY THIS NOW WCW IS OWNED BY THE WWF AND IT WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS THIS,989971200,,891,4.309523809523809
