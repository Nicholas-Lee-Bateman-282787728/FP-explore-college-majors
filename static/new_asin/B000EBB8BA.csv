8108013,5,B000EBB8BA,"This intimate portrait of the life of one Baka family is tastefully and respectfully done. You feel as if you are part of the tribe, traveling, fishing, hunting, and eating with them. Narrated unobtrusively by Denzel Washington. This is a very hard to find video but well worth the search. Perfect for both professors/teachers of anthropology and sociology, and also for anyone who is interested in other cultures. First released in 1988, I can't help but wonder what these people are doing now. Despite being a bit more than twenty years old, this documentary is as current and fresh as when it was first released.",1272153600,4,615,4.866666666666666
