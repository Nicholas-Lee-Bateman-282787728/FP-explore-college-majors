8373588,4,B002M6QOAU,"This DVD isn't bad for a 3-5 year-old.  My 6-year old received this as a gift for her birthday.  She likes it, but it's very short, so it leaves her wanting more, and there apparently aren't any other DVDs with these characters.  Overall, I'd say it would be excellent for a young girl (especially one with a short attention span), but don't waste your money on it unless you're planning on supplementing your purchase with the action figures and accessories.",1259280000,,459,4.7125
