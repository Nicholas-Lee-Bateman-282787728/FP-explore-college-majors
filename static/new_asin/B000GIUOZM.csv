The Lessons The Land The Spirit

Computer animation visualises and helps to teach an ancient music that played as our higher dreams were forming

Chris Adnam enjoys the priviledge of being a student of Amhemland tribal teachers

His knowledge and both his traditional and innovative performances are highly regarded right across Australia

Great video for both beginners and advanced players.

Chris' video is the most comprehensive and friendly visual learning aid for the Didjeridoo on the market.

Well-received by a variety of Didgeridoo playing groups in Australia, it has already successfully helped thousands of people learn how to play the Didgeridoo or Yidaki.

This program has eight sections that will take you from the initial basic learning stages, to circular breathing techniques, and then advanced multi-voice performances.

Didgeridoo notes are represented visually as animated pictograms which are overlaid on the live-action teaching sequences.

This video took two intensive years of production!

Chris Adnam reverently studied the didgeridoo in Arhnem Land, and developed a teaching technique that extracts elements of the appealing staccato Aboriginal playing style from ancient Aboriginal social contexts.

Chris's virtuoso re-presentation of the Arnhen Land style offers traditional, individual and experimental directions in playing the didgeridoo.

His video addresses the growing multicultural interest in this powerful instrument, yet preserves the true essence of Aboriginal culture, social functions and traditional Aboriginal music.

Chris also understands and respects that the traditional didgeridoo notes and songs belong to the Aboriginal tribes.

Between teaching segments are the evocative on-location filmed landscapes where the didgeridoo instrument was born.",1168041600,,1840,5.969465648854962
