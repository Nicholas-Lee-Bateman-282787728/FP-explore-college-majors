It definitely helps if you're a JAWS fanatic, as the more scenes and lines you've memorized, the more fun is experienced while watching TREES! Some of the woodland versions of Spielberg's oceanic sequences are ingeniously realized! Highly recommended...",1297123200,,380,5.35
7963631,4,B0000683NE,"I thought Trees was hilarious! It makes fun of Jaws, but with killer pine trees! Everyone seems so serious, but they are talking nonsense! I have owned this for a few months, but yesterday after work, I finally sat down and watched it all the way through! I had a great time watching it! I highly recommend TREES!!!",1237680000,,315,4.448275862068965

7963633,4,B0000683NE,"I saw this movie when it premiered in theatres last September and it was hilarious! It is a shot by shot parody of ""Jaws"", with the great white shark being replaced with a great white pine! Incredible attention to detail and a taste of TREES II once the credits have rolled - I can hardly wait to own it!",998956800,,304,4.169491525423729
