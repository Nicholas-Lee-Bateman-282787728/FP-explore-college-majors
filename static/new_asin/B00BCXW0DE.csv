5580185,5,B00BCXW0DE,"This film, narrated by Sir Derek Jacobi, explores the precipitous, passionate life of the British writer Graham Greene. Three threads weave throughout Greene's like, and this film, all three of which invite intrigue and peril. To escape the boredom of ordinary life Greene pursues in his life and writing the desolation of some of the twentieth century's most tragic events--death and destruction in Kenya, Viet Nam, and Haiti--in novels such as ""The Third Man"" and ""The Quiet American"". A second thread leads Greene into the wilderness of depression and to the brink of despair, even to the point of suicide, for example, in his first novel ""The Man Within"". A third finds Greene precariously balancing faith and doubt, fidelity and infidelity, to God and wife. Doubts permeate his struggles as a Catholic Christian, while at the same time faith sustains him in those struggles, as portrayed in novels such as ""Brighton Rock"" and ""The Heart of the Matter"". Director Thomas O'Connor skillfully weaves into the fabric of this film's narrative all three threads; the intrigue, the impetuousness, the grit and grime of Greene's life and novels are all here, as well as their majesty.

5580186,5,B00BCXW0DE,"I have been a fan of Graham Greene since I read The Quiet American. This documentary gave me a much better understanding of this reclusive writer. The research done to produce this was top-notch, and the interviews from many different perspectives gives the viewer a much better understanding of this incredible writer. This video should be mandatory viewing for anyone studying Greene and his works. Bravo!",1377993600,3,407,5.181818181818182
5580187,4,B00BCXW0DE,"Dangerous Edge: Graham Greene's Intrigue and Depression

During his tenure with British intelligence, Graham Greene reported directly to the notorious Soviet mole Kim Philby.  It was rather fitting the espionage novelist and chronic adulterer would be so closely associated with such a significant betrayer.  Yet, Greene consistently offered tortured defenses of his friend.  He was ""complicated"" that way.  Thomas P. O'Connor surveys the writer's work and ironic life in Dangerous Edge: A Life of Graham Greene (promo here), which airs this Friday night on most PBS outlets.

Greene was never awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he was nominated for an Oscar.  Indeed, with so many Greene's books and screenplays produced for the big screen, O'Connor has a wealth of cinematic imagery available to illustrate Greene's oeuvre, without ever scraping the bottom of the barrel.  In fact, at least two of Greene's scripts became outright masterpieces: The Third Man and Fallen Idol, both directed by Carol Reed.

Essentially, O'Connor focuses on three sides of Greene's persona: the writer, the adventurer, and the adulterous, spiritually doubting manic depressive.  Much is made of Greene's persistent ""boredom,"" his euphemism for depression, as well as his conversion to a decidedly flawed but earnest brand of Catholicism.  Greene's biographers point to Greene's reluctant status as the preeminent ""Catholic novelist"" of his time, while rather openly carrying-on with a woman who was not his wife, as one of the many great contradictions defining his life.  Fair enough.

O'Connor incorporates talking head interviews with some top shelf literary figures, including Sir John Mortimer, Paul Theroux, David Lodge, and John Le Carr, who (quite surprisingly) blasts Philby for coldly and deliberately causing the deaths of numerous colleagues.  Again, O'Connor was fortunate to have considerable audio recordings Greene, sounding like quite the acidic raconteur.  Bill Nighy also serves as the supplemental voice of the author, reading his letters and documents when the archival Greene is not available.  It is a rather classy package, narrated by Sir Derek Jacobi.

Aside from Le Carr, Edge's participants largely give Greene a pass on Philby and related Cold War issues.  Great pains are taken to portray him as an equal opportunity geopolitical gadfly, but it is far from convincing.  Nonetheless, the complexity of Greene's relationship to his Catholic faith should interest readers and viewers across the spectrum.  A well paced examination of a flawed but fascinating figure, Dangerous Edge follows Philip Roth: Unmasked (another unsuccessful Nobel contender, thus far), this Friday (3/29) on PBS stations nationwide.

5580188,5,B00BCXW0DE,"Dangerous Edge: A Life of Graham Greene is a comprehensive look at the life and work of British author Graham Greene. While he is best known for his novels The Third Man, The Quiet American, and The End of the Affair, he also worked in British counter-intelligence for a time and spoke out against the United States government's misguided attempts at nation-building. As a writer and a public figure, he has a complicated but important legacy as a man who fought for the underdog and fought to survive his severe depression as thoughts of suicide plagued him his entire life. PBS has produced an excellent documentary that covers all these aspects of his life while still staying focused and informative.

I knew I was in for a treat with this documentary when I saw that Sir Derek Jacobi was the film's narrator and that Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Shaun of the Dead) would be reading Graham Greene's letters and other correspondence. I had heard of The Third Man but had no idea of its connection to Greene's career with British counter-intelligence and Greene's boss Kim Philby, who later turned out to be a Soviet spy. The narration moves seamlessly from Greene's inner struggles with depression to his various love affairs and his travels, and it makes the connections between his life and his writing. Also, I found myself intrigued by Greene's views on the Catholic Church and his own faith in God. He was considered a Catholic writer, but I seriously doubt that the Catholic Church would claim him as their own today with his outspoken political views, not to mention his inability to stay faithful in his marriage.

I appreciate Dangerous Edge because it looks at Graham Greene's whole life and acknowledges his achievements as well as his shortcomings. The film never suggests that his brilliance excused his shortcomings or moments of hypocrisy. He was a writer and a human being who made mistakes but also managed a lot of good in his lifetime, and this film is a fine tribute to him. This is a must-see for anyone interested in writing, the work of British counter-intelligence, or mental illness in an age before full understanding about treating mental illness.

5580189,4,B00BCXW0DE,"This dvd provides a very good summary of Graham Greene, both the man and his writings. It provides an excellent introductiion to the writer for those who are not that familiar with his life and works as well as a good summary of his accomplishments for those who are already fans. The complexity of the man and his varied novels is well covered. Recommended.",1374451200,4,358,4.609375
5580190,3,B00BCXW0DE,"Watched this last night and had high hopes for it.  I've read a great deal of what Greene has written, but I only knew a very little about his life.  What I had known before this was his promiscuity and he use of alcohol and drugs and his constant travelling.  Just a reading of a few of the books would give one an idea of what his inner life must have been like, though.

This film did give a decent outline of his life and there was a fair amount about his depression and promiscuity, but it was put together in a lackluster and really in the end boring way.

For a guy who wrote until really the end of his life and produced good work for most of that time the feel for his books was lacking.  He traveled all over most of his life ""to escape the boredom"" he said and some of that was certainly covered, but once again the film makers just couldn't draw you in.

Still if you really know little or nothing about his life and would like to learn more this would be a reasonable place to start.  I'd rent it on Amazon instant rather than buy it though.",1374019200,,1054,4.08252427184466
