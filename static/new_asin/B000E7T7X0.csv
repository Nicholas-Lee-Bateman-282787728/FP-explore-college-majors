8106963,4,B000E7T7X0,"Most of us are familiar with ""The Grinch that Stole Christmas"", a beloved story that has since become a staple in my family every Christmas. I was pleased to find the ABC Family channel screening this yesterday and promptly tivo-ed it. Though not superior as ""The Grinch that Stole Christmas"", it definitely merits a watch.

The story focuses on the Grinch who is back to his mean and bullying ways, wanting to go out and scare the citizens of Whoville. The citizens of Whoville lock themselves into their homes in order to avoid being spooked by the Grinch, but a lone young boy named Eukariah decides to save his town and stands up to the Grinch.

In classic Seuss fashion, the colors are vivid and vibrant, and the signature rhymes make for a delightful sing-song listening experience. The animation is whimsical and wonderful and will have young ones looking on in awe. My 8.5-year-old, a great fan of Dr. Seuss' works, could not take her eyes off the show and was singing along with some of the songs.

A note of caution though: there are some scenes that might be a little too scary for the under 5 set and the Grinch's bright orange eyes might prove a tad creepy for the little ones, but on the whole this is great fun and perfect for Halloween.",1382832000,,1252,4.530973451327434
8106964,2,B000E7T7X0,"I watched this one when I was a kid because I loved ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" as most people do. Unfortunately, I found this one to be a bit scary and mostly unpleasant. A kid goes into the Grinch's wagon of horrors to face a variety of floating grotesques, as taunting music plays in the background. In the end he gets out. This film, which isn't based on any original Seuss book that I know if, is not really necessary. There's not enough Grinch here, and too much outright weirdness.",1356912000,4,494,4.43956043956044
8106965,5,B000E7T7X0,My kids have watched this over and over and it is as good as the Grinch as the music and rhyming is fun to hear over and over.  Kids can identify with the little boy in the movie who goes out on Halloween to save his town from the Grinch.,1341360000,,238,3.76
8106966,5,B000E7T7X0,"My review is on the Emmy Award winning ""Halloween is Grinch Night"", shortened later to just ""Grinch Night"" . It's a 30 minute Halloween special that originally aired on ABC On October 29, 1977. The Grinch Night story is not well known, but those that have seen it hold a special place for it in their hearts. Obviously not all of the animated specials of Seuss stories have been on the same level as the ""The Grinch that Stole Christmas"", but they are very enjoyable in their own right. The narrator and the Grinch is voiced this time by Hans Conried. There are great songs  as you might expect, with Thurl Ravenscroft reprising his singing role.

Without giving away the whole story, you see the Grinch didn't stay good after Christmas and is back to being dastardly and mean. The citizens of Whoville notice the sour-sweet wind blowing and know that it means GRINCH NIGHT is coming. The ""Whos"" lock up their doors and windows to hide as this wind means that the Grinch is coming to terrify them on Halloween night. A boy named Eukariah decides that the Grinch must be stopped, so he faces his fears and confronts the Grinch and his countless monsters and spooks he has brought to attack the town. It is an enjoyable tale for the holiday.

Dr. Seuss personal influence is always apparent in his specials. He was the Producer this time along with Warner Brothers Studio's Friz Freleng. His original story and artwork comes alive. There is a different, more muted color scheme than most of his other films, but that is mostly due to the story occurring at night and the Halloween theme.

There were about 4 different releases of this story on VHS. This story also appears on a newer DVD with Green Eggs and Ham and 2 other short stories.",1164844800,9,1736,4.572347266881029
