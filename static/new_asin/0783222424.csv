If they put Jacks'""On The Road"" on screen,he would definately be the prime candidate for Dean Moriarty.{Neal}I had this on order about a year before it finally came out,and I reccomend it to anyone who ever just jumped in a car and yelled""GO CAT,GO"" What kicks are to be had when living free,but there is a price.

47615,4,0783222424,"worth watching... this movie sums up randomness and seemingly un-consequential action into a (depending on the way you think) meaningful whole. the movie doesn't dive very deeply into the 'souls' of the characters, though, nothing (seems to me) of the beat genre is obvious in it's manifestation of any character so it sticks to it's class in it's quick movement and random directionless expression. this is a fast movie, almost seems like gibberish, except it does make sense when you stop thinking too hard about it. really, when you sum it all up, life usually seems like gibberish anyway. in it's disjointed and jolting way this short story draws your curiosity. a movie with no pretences, it doesn't try to be profound. but in a subtle way it is. the lack of obviousness and missing 'meaning' you may search for is only there if you pay attention to everything that is missing. just watch it. maybe you'll see. in my opinion. good. but rent it before you think about buying it.",994118400,5,982,4.748538011695906

47617,4,0783222424,"This poetic film takes a few viewings to fully appreciate. Thomas Jane is wonderful as Neal Cassady, and the small part of Harry is brilliantly played by Keanu Reeves in one of his many transformations. He looks short, sleazy, and even (if you can believe it) a little unattractive. The man is a chameleon ! While some may feel that Harry stopped Neal from achieving what he wanted in life, I think he knew Neal better than anyone, freeing him to be his true self, a wanderer and a source of the beat movement",960076800,7,509,4.425531914893617
47618,4,0783222424,"They said Seinfeld was a show about nothing, and the mainstream reviewers of this movie give this movie a bum rap! Well folks this is it, loud and clear from the heart. This movie bring light to a generation exploring the  few things left in this world untarnished, and the curious natural flow  which resides in every human. Neal Cassady was more than an influence and a  friend to Kerouac. He was an influence on the every person on that Merry  Prankster bus careening down the highway to mystical destinations. He was  an influence spanning generations, and will remain that in those to come.  In this film, Cassady (Thomas Jane) is pouring heart and expirience out to  Jack in letter flash-backs, reliving an episode to an friend while  revitalising his spirit. Yes it's true that this was all written in one  sitting by Cassady on Dec. 17, 1950 during a benzedrine trip. The free  spirit doing what it takes to get by, and as a young heart not knowing,  though thinking what is best for himself. A tradgedy of sorts, though  self-inflicted through earlier decisions. This movie, as with the original  letter, is constant benzedrine flash, movie as the Beats did, in a scatter  of emotions and crazy sites. Nothing like something that can get a spark  glowing in the restless empty soul searching for release.",920246400,17,1313,4.747787610619469

Without giving away the whole movie, I can say that it is a great story about the choices people make and how they may change the trajectory of ones life.  While not action packed like many block buster movies the public is used to seeing Keanu Reeves star in, it does have an emotional depth that is well acted.
I must add that it is wonderful to see young stars like Thomas Jane, Adrian Brody, Amy Smart and Gretchen Mol before they became popular and stars of blockbuster movies.",1391904000,4,620,4.4298245614035086
47625,4,0783222424,"""The Last Time I Committed Suicide"" is based on Neal Cassady's letters to Jack Kerouac trying to explain his life in Denver before he fell in with Kerouac and the rest of the beat generation players. The movie is based on the famous ""Cherry Mary"" letter to Kerouac in which Kerouac says he found the voice of ""On The Road"" in Cassady's writing.

The film takes place when Cassady is 19 years old he works nights in a tire factory and Cassady wants better things for himself in life, he'd been in reform school for a series of car stealing, joy riding actually and he has a weakness for pretty women. Cassady does  wants to conform to societal norms, he wants a wife and family with the white picket fence, like it's will contain his every and need, but Cassady's wanderlust for what's around the next bend or the next chick will finally satisfy him. The suicide described in the title isn't a literal one but a figurative one that Cassady kept inflicting on himself when he was close to getting what he said he wanted.

Thomas Jane catches the conman aspect of Cassady's personality, and resembles the Cassady, even though he looks about 10 years too old to be playing a 19 year old Cassady. Keanu Reeves plays Harry, a pool playing pal of Cassady's who plays the devils advocate to the better angels of Cassady's intentions.

Director Stephen Kay tries to mimic Cassady's frenetic cadences of his letters through editing in parts of the film.

There are no special features. A little documentary about Kerouac and Cassady might have made the film a little more accessible to those who aren't familiar with their relationship. The film could stand for that information to be contained some where knowing about Kerouac and Cassady would fill in information for the viewer, without it the uninitatiated may find themselves a little lost in the plot.",1297468800,3,1847,4.705882352941177
47626,4,0783222424,"I've watched this movie a number of times, and liked it enough to replace my aged vhs copy when VCR's went the way of the dodo.  It's a fun movie to watch, and if you enjoy Beat culture at all, it's one of the best films that has been made that captures what any of them were like at all.  There are only two movies I know of that are about Neal Cassady, this film, and ""Heart Beat"", which is out of print, and even if you can find it, not very enjoyable or accurate.  It's based loosely on one of Neal's letters written to Allen and Jack, who thought it was a fantastic story back when it was written, and it does make for a good tale.  The film adapts it to have the essential drunk Kerouac figure pining in a bar over lost love, played amusingly by Keanu Reeves, and the typical poor composite of Allen, pining over Neal, though of course they are re written here, with other names, but the archetypes are the same.  The part of Neal was brilliantly performed by Thomas Jane, and is probably his best and most understated role.  Neal paces frantically, recaps tires over night, can't get put on the day shift, lives hand to mouth because he spends all his money at the local pool hall.  He walks about like a caged panther, snapping his fingers, and muttering to himself, much like the real Neal did, occasionally stopping to do a pull up in a door frame, or type a few words on his type writer, his frantic movements underscored by a terrific Jazz score that adds the needed momentum to his tale.  He gets involved with the wrong people, goes on wild rides, pines over lost love himself, and the ""proverbial picket fences"".  What is best about the story is that it gets what others miss about Neal Cassady, and why the Beats thought he was so important. His philosophy of ""Go, Man Go, where are we gonna go man?, I don;t know but we gotta get there"".  And Neal was so frantic to live all at once, that he was all over the place.  This movie perfectly captures that, and what Kerouac was talking about in the Subterraneans.  Hey, give it a go, if you don't like it, at least you tried it out.  It's what Neal would have done.",1296259200,3,2128,4.263681592039801
47627,4,0783222424,"The cinematography is intentionally choppy, skewed and angular. It slowly lets you enter the doorway to the world of Cassady. However,just when you think you may be sinking into the mire of his life, you are yanked out and thrown haphazard against a wall of antic jazz.

Back then, men had no desire to come in touch with their feminine side. They would have said ""WTF are you talking about? "" Men remained detached and bonded over beer and pool. Not so difference from today? There was a feeling of freedom and utter carelessnes for those few who chose not to enter the conventional roles. After all, the war was over and the future promised and held anything we yearned for. Summers were long, pleasures were simple...get high, ride the roads in a cool, hopped-up convertable, or hot-rod, if you were lucky. If everything really came up trumps, that back seat saw some major action!

There is no way to get inside a man who lived for the moment, chased etherial dreams and earthly pleasures. Some lives you can nail down, twist the ends so the pinion can not be removed, and only then you can define the meaning of it all. Others, like Cassidy's, turn into mist and fly away. So what are we trying to glean from this study of a misanthrope? Cassady took that one part of us that analyses everything, desires everything, and figures there must be a way to make it all happen, and forged something akin to a life. Most of us just drag this part of our psyche out once in while, and when we are done musing, tuck it back away in some safe, dark place to hibernate til the mood hits us one day when we are lonely, weak or depressed.

Back then rules were rules, not just guidelines. Guilt shadowed us everywhere like a demon on our heels. If you fell in love,got pregnant etc. marriage was the next step. No one questioned that. It was the dream for which men and women had fought and died. Who would question that? Cassidy did! All of us did a little, though we might not have said so around the Sunday dinner table. We needed to fit in, to assimilate into the culture of the time.

Here comes Cassady....he followed the less taken path. True, he felt all the basics... lust, passion, hunger for it all. Some people say men never get older than 12. Maybe that is true. For Cassady 12 seemed to be a great age to be....full of the mysteries of being! He grabbed onto moments like a drowning man grapples for a rope. Each moment was a patch on an unfinished quilt. The overall effect of said quilt is exquisite when you stand back and view the whole. It is only when you zoom in on each individual scrap can you see the the tears, sweat, and the blood from needle-pricked fingers. Cassady, a life lived only in retrospect.

Thomas Jane captures the vibrant, sometimes exhilerating, spirit that was Neal Cassady, in this homage to a troubled soul. Taken from letters written by Cassady, a smoky, untethered glimpse into what we may only surmise is a tortured attempt to define a man, this movie doesn't answer any questions, but then again, it never intended to! It lets us be a fly on the wall. For those of us who go back that far, the characters in this movie remind us of people we once knew, hung out with at the corner gas staion, and with whom we rode ""chicken"""" races along country highways etc. For the younger viewer, unless you are a 40's/50's buff, it may not hold much for you. You need to have lived in a less complicated time to understand how such unequivicable simplicity of life illicits such passion, such pain, such agony of living.

What was Cassady doing? He was chasing a dream only he hoped to understand! Wanna come along for the ride? Be aware there are bumps and detours and dead ends along the way!

P.S. fine supporting role for Keanu...clean, precision acting in his lesser role!",1287619200,2,3805,4.4661870503597125

It has been a long time since I've seen this but the one thing I strongly remember is that its the first movie I've seen where I think Keanu Reeves really let go and acted, usually he is so monotone with everything he does but this movie was like watching a different person.

Pros

-The old school feel of the jazzy songs are a big plus; very smooth and melancholy. I think it captured the big picture of the environment they were in, in spades and spades...
-90% of the people on-screen are quite attractive
-The story has you interested in the beginning...

Cons

-...But then it falls off dramatically
-Keanu wasn't in the movie enough; you see him play pool once, and make out once...
-The main character NEVER gets his life together
-One of his girlfriends commits suicide in the bathroom
-This movie dragged on towards the end like no other, I swear!

The main thing I loved about this movie was that the main character, Cassidy, who's quite the looker, wanted to have a life - a REAL life; one filled with a family, a wife, a kid or two, and some ambitions and drive...he doesn't quite find that during the course of the movie, but he doesn't give up...

3.1 stars.

If I could sum this movie up in 11 words or less it would be:

Get your life together; and more Keanu Reeves, pretty, pretty please!",1191715200,2,1048,4.478947368421053
47631,4,0783222424,"Hugely underrated film, most probably because of its art school-like visuals, ""Suicide"" is based upon an actual letter beat hero Neal Cassady wrote to Jack Kerouac about he and a girl almost but did not quite get the American Dream. Thomas Jane (who played Mickey Mantle in ""61*"") is equisite as Cassady, bringing a frenetic energy to the screen much in the way a Kerouac or Ginsburg reader would picture him and his smooth talking, car stealing self. Keanu Reeves surprises as Harry, the devil on Cassady's shoulder (who isn't actually based on any living person) who removes Cassady from his chance to hook back up with Joan and his future happiness. Gretchen Mol surprises as a hot, sexy underage sexpot Neal can't keep his hands off of. The acting is superb, the direction equally as good, and the writing brings us to the beat times of a beat god in a beat post-war world.

It all perfectly meshes with the soundtrack, a mix of classic and modern bebop that brings it all together.",1145836800,3,986,4.666666666666667
47632,4,0783222424,"I know very little about the Beat culture and have never read anything by Kerouac, but I still enjoyed this movie. And as other reviewers have said before, the movie doesn't really have a ""point"" and it's not trying to change your views on the world. What it is doing is telling a story about a young man who is fighting with himself. Neal Cassidy, at the point in his life this movie captures, is torn between a self that wants to settle down with a wife and kid and live in a house with a picket fence, and a self that wants to escape with few ties and see what exactly the world can offer him. I think it's a story that many people can relate to. I, personally, loved the movie. I enjoyed the way in which the told the story, I loved the music, and I thought the actors were fantastic.",1133827200,4,788,4.123376623376624
47633,5,0783222424,"It seems that this movie can only be appreciated by fans of beat literature. If you happen to be one, or are curious about the beats, this is a fantastic movie. The movie is a dramatization of a letter that Neal Cassidy, the muse of the beat generation, wrote his famous pal, Jack Kerouac. The film brings to life all the snappy, fireball energy that was Neal Cassidy while also demonstrating the subtle poetic irony that of the beat generation. If you don't know anything about the beats, or don't care to, then this one will leave you scratching your head. If, on the other hand, you can name three beat authors and a half a dozen Charlie Parker tunes off the top of your head, then you'd be a fool not check this one out.

47634,3,0783222424,"""The Last Time I Committed Suicide"" was adapted for the screen by director Stephen Kay from a letter written by Beat  icon Neal Cassady to his friend, author Jack Kerouac. In this letter, Cassady recounted his youthful adventures in Denver in 1945-1946. During this time, Cassady supported himself working the graveyard shift for a tire company and spent his days chasing women, ""borrowing"" cars, and hanging out at the pool hall with an older deadbeat acquaintance named Harry. The film's sights and sounds often mimic Cassady's  frenetic personality. His skirt-chasing and petty mischief are set to the sounds of bebop, and the film's cinematography sometimes exhibits a hyperactive nervousness. ""The Last Time I Committed Suicide"" doesn't seem to have a point...or even a focus. It is simply a dramatization of the events of Neal Cassady's life when he was 18-19 years old. He was no more or less aimless than than he was to become, although he did not yet consider aimlessness to be a vocation in itself. Actor Thomas Jane does a nice job as Cassady, although he appears too old for the part. Keanu Reeves put on some weight for his role, and he is convincing as Neal's vaguely creepy and frequently drunk pool hall buddy Harry. Adrien Brody and Gretchen Mol also contribute interesting supporting performances. This is not a bad movie. But the audience's reaction to this film is going to depend entirely upon their attitude toward -and knowledge of- the real Neal Cassady. ""The Last Time I Committed Suicide"" is simply a slice of his life. There is no attempt to place Cassady's experiences in any larger context, concrete or abstract. So the film doesn't have general appeal. You either find Cassady interesting or you don't. So I'm recommending ""The Last Time I Committed Suicide"" to fans of Neal Cassady and students of Beat culture. I doubt that anyone else will have much patience for it.",1074470400,35,1899,4.912772585669782
47635,1,0783222424,"I only bought this for Keanu Reeves, and thankfully, it was only 3.99, so it wasn't too much of a waste. I also bought Tomb Raider, and was expecting to hate that, and like this. Funny that.
I survived a very long 28 minutes, and then switched it off. I just couldn't watch it anymore. I wasn't concentrating on it, and if I'm getting bored during a film, I will check how long has gone by. I first checked 15 minutes into the film.
I am crazy about Keanu Reeves, so I thought this film would be a good buy. Plus, it's not very well known, and I was shocked to find out it was made in 1997 - I thought it would have been early nineties or so. If you think Keanu Reeves is gorgeous, do not buy this. He looks about average. I dunno whether its due to the storyline or what, but he acts like he's drunk, and looks & acts like a total sleazebag. His hair looks greasy, and he just doesn't look like him!
Anyway, back to the film. None of the characters are introduced, leading to me get very confused about the lead character, who starts off the film, kissing a girl in a hospital, and then going home, and sleeping with another girl, who decides to slash her wrists just before I stopped watching. He then proceeds to run off with his ""mate"" Keanu Reeves, and pick up two girls along the way.
Maybe the film gets better later on, and maybe I'll watch it again sometime. But I'll need to be in a BIG Keanu mood to watch this again. Which is worse: Bram Stoker's Dracula or this?! I don't understand how a film can be based on a letter!",1059523200,5,1532,4.144295302013423
47636,5,0783222424,"I am writing this because I am in stark disagreement with the Amazon editor. This little film shows excellent directing, cinematography and acting. It stands as testimony against, and is infinitely better then, most of the talantless ""indie"" wastes of time that you'll see in the country's smaller theaters today. Thomas Jane BECOMES a young Neal Cassady, and displays one of the finer performances you'll ever see on film. In fact, the acting is excellent overall (To which the director should be praised). Admittedly, if you are interested in the legend of Neal Cassady this movie is going to be much more interesting to you. Still, even if you are not, it is a fine story of unrequited love touched with humor and the spirit of the enjoyment of life. It is a touching period piece, excellently delivered and exceptionally written. The other Cassady-driven movie (unrelated to this cast and crew) - ""Heart Beat"" (1980) - hits you like a stale yellow lamp on boring Sunday afternoon in comparison.  This film is vivid and beautiful. It is a shame that a film of this caliber is being ignorantly shuffled under the carpet, becoming prematurely harder to fine with each passing day, while the constant deluge of mindlessness produced by the big studios becomes marketed ad nauseam over the course of decades. Stephen T. Kay made the kind of film that inspires filmmakers.

The soundtrack - also becoming harder and harder to find - cannot be beat (It remained untouched from my CD player for months). Personally, I had never been a fan of jazz music before owning it.",1044316800,7,1566,4.83955223880597

But he is famous for his long letters to Jack Kerouac. This film is based on a 30-something page letter to Jack from Neal. (A copy of the letter can be found in the ""Beat Reader"" edited by Ann Charters). Thomas Jane does an excellent job capturing the essence of Cassady. I consider him one of the greatest overlooked actors today. (See him also as Mickey Mantle in ""61*"") Claire Forlani is also excellent, also overlooked. Keanu Reeves also does well, in his post-Bill-and-Ted, pre-Matrix days.

7790143,2,0783222424,"I didn't particularly care for this one. I bought it because Keanu was in it, though he is not the central character.

In this movie, the main character (Neal) lives with a girl, but early on, he is shown sweeping his girl (Joan) off her feet at her work. After a little bedroom time, with Neal asleep, she gets up and goes to the bathroom and slits her wrists. He finds her and she ends up in the hospital, suffering from acute depression. He visits her once, and can't force himself to go back.

From that point forward, he's conflicted, on the one hand philandering around town like a playboy, shooting pool with his buddy (played by Keanu, who plays a sort of sad, older version or Neal), but also waxing on with friends and his older co-worker at the tire plant about he dreams of one day settling down and having a wife he adores, children, and the house with a white picket fence. He's at a bar one night and an attractive lady comes in (Marg Helgenburger) and gets him to go home with her, but to his surprise her husband is there and Neal appears to think he's been brought there for some kind of threesome, until Joan appears.

I'm not going to reveal what takes place from there, but I would liken it to a man with an angel on one shoulder, and a devil on the other. In this case, Joan and the whole white picket fence fantasy is the angel, and Keanu represents the devil on the other shoulder.

I get the premise, but it was a whole lot of nothing to point out, some people just can't make good life choices. It was well acted by everyone in it, but the story didn't come close to measuring up to the talent of the actors in it.

Normally I have no patience for elaborated over-acting-like performances from the 1940's - but the artistic filming captured assumming mundane details that made me feel like as if I stepped into a time machine to peek into people's personal homes/public places of that era and it was enjoyable to see what things used to look like - I loved how the cameraman zeroed in some items to punctuate the characters feelings - like spinning above a phone; zeroing in a coffee cup and a slide of homemade bread was a voyeur's foodie delight .  I actually learned a lot on multiple levels of the writer as I love movies made from true events.... it opens my world to learn of new amazing real people who led an adventurous life that is not well known.  (Reminds me a lot of 'The Whole Wide World').  I also learned from the film of Neal Cassady's decisions affected the rest of his life and I could identify of having made poor choices in my own life and how it has totally derailed me onto a new path that I did not want to pursue. Hit a raw nerve there for me personally. If I had space in my DVD library, I would add this one. For now I'll tuck in the entertaining memories in my mind.",1480291200,3,1290,4.344398340248962

The title might put off some potential viewers, but the descriptions of the DVD box certainly help.

Definitely see this film and ON THE ROAD.",1466553600,2,397,4.364864864864865
