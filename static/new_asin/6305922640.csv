1086241,4,6305922640,"The story is of the crew of a first aide spaceship, the Florence Nightingale, being lured into some faraway planetary system by some distress call.  During the 'warp' to get to their destination, the  mission's leader dies, and that lets the team to cope with what expects  them there...
They rescue one guy and find out that he had discovered  some kind of strange artifact on the planetoid.  Little by little, a few  things appear clearer: 1) The guy is not what he seemed at first (big  surprise there...); 2) The artifact is not just a pretty trinklet (another  big surprise...); 3) Somewhere, the artifact represents a menace and the  guy they rescued will do all he can to protect it.
The story is actually  clever, with undertones of some old Star Trek episodes, but much more  realistically treated.  The characters are quite full and interesting, even  though some of them are mediocre personas (and second rate actors.)  Finally, the special effects are great, thanks for the democratization of  IT resources necessary to recreate weightlessness and space views.",961459200,12,1072,4.943820224719101
1086242,1,6305922640,"This is a prime example of what happens when the Hollywood production process goes out of control -- you end up with a hundred million dollars gone, a director taking a pseudonym (Walter Hill directed it), a studio  hoping to hide the shame while getting at least a *few* bucks back, and a  length of film that ranges from the incomprehensible to the ludicrous to  the repetetive.
This is one of those projects where the script department  ran out of colors for the various changes and drafts -- I strongly suspect  that they ended up raiding the Scottish tartan library.  So many people had  a hand in writing the script that the final credits determination more  resembled a lottery than a Writers Guild process.
The story ... an  ""ambulance"" ship, piloted by a disgraced military hotshot (James  Spader) and crewed by Angela Bassett, Robin Tunney, Lou Diamond Phillips,  and others, receives an emergency distress call from a far-off mining  operation.  Following a harrowing ""dimension jump"" that turns the  laid-back Captain (Robert Forster) into pizza, Spader and Bassett must face  down an artifact-powered superman -- before he gets back to Earth with the  artifact and blows everything up.  Will bad acting triumph over worse  acting?  Will grand visual effects and set design lull audiences?  Well, in  the latter instance, nope.
I wrote a novel based on the script for this  movie.  To this day, I'm not sure if I should be grateful that a licensing  issue resulted in the book vanishing from Tor's schedule.  Do yourself a  favor -- go buy INDEPENDENCE DAY or THE ABYSS on DVD.  They, at least, make  some sort of sense.",961372800,4,1632,4.836363636363636
1086243,5,6305922640,"Supernova offers a great plot and flawless acting, reinforced by stunning animation. The whole ship is so believable that it makes you feel on board! However, if you don't like hard-core sci-fi you might miss the story, because it is stuffed with hi-tech terms and scientific hypotheses that general public finds hard to digest. Some say the movie needed 5 more minutes at the end to explain what's going on; others say it's just a mild horror flick in sci-fi candy-wrapping ;-) In my humble writer's opinion, it has everything a good sci-fi movie needs. As for the ""missing"" end, I think it's all left up to you--the viewer--to fill in the blanks. BTW, if you watch the deleted scenes you'll see precisely why they were deleted with BIG scissors. To me, the story is very fresh and the acting is superb!",961372800,,804,4.669014084507042
1086244,3,6305922640,"I would first like to start off by saying, before going into the movie today, I thought it was gonna blow chunks...hard...and that's not a euphemism. All I heard about this flick is bad, bad, bad.but those are  professional critics, and I'm only 14. Director Walter Hill had disowned  his film, and hid (I guess) under the pseudonym Thomas Lee. I also heard  that this movie was in the can for a couple years (it was supposed to come  out near Event Horizon's release date in 1997? It's not clear if that's  true or not, though) until someone picked it up and finished editing it.  What else could go wrong? Well, I didn't find out until today (January 16),  when I had to drive 1 hour to see the movie. Will it be an hour I had to  regret? Let's see...
I want to start out with the good things...very good  visuals and sound. I watched it in a very new movie theater with Dolby  Digital EX and stadium seating.can't get any better. The space shots were  awesome. But that's not the entire movie, now is it? It had pretty decent  acting, something you don't find very often in these spacey sci-fi movies.  And then...um...well...there's not too much to add about the good things.  Now, don't think I'm gonna trash this movie. The movie was way too short to  develop a very good plot.about as long as The Blair Witch Project (I think  87 minutes not counting the credits?). It didn't focus too much on the  oncoming supernova, rather the bad guy. The alien artifact they found was  not completely explained...I was left wondering what the heck it was. Is it  because I had to go to the bathroom during the movie to flush $5 down the  toilet? Nah, it was way too confusing. A 9th dimension thingamabob inside  3rd dimension matter? Hmm. And, it was a little predictable, and that's not  very good. I like spoiling movies before I go seeing them, but if I hadn't,  it would still be predictable. Like aforementioned, it was too short to  incorporate any good twists. The camera work was like NYPD Blue on a bad  day! Too many light feedbacks, and it was really shaky. And there was a  little too much sex in the movie. It kind of revolved around that aspect,  especially the bad guy.
In the end, ""Supernova"" is not a  spectacular movie, but if you want a little fun, check it out if you're  into sci-fi flicks. Don't expect a mind-blower, though.",961200000,12,2343,4.459905660377358

1086553,2,6305922640,"TL;DR:
Supernova feels like it was written completely by a teenager who wanted to write a knock-off of Event Horizon but had no idea how to write characters or give them purpose to live. Some terrible movies are still extremely enjoyable. This one just isn't.

The Long Version (some spoilers):
There are some truly horrible movies out there that deserve 1 star. This one is pretty bad, but it's not 1-star bad (no visible camera mics popping into the screen, no flimsy props that bend when a character puts any pressure on them, etc...). I suppose if you've never seen a quality movie before, or read about any AI before, this might be considered good. That said, this is barely above a 1-star.

There's a great cast of talented actors, but the script is just terrible (and not the funny kind of terrible). It's bad from the very beginning, where the ship computer wakes up a crew member who is suddenly alert and having conversations with the computer about how ""wanting"" is a human quality and so the ship computer could not express ""want."" (facepalm)

It's like a teenager wanted to write something deep but had no idea how to do it, so you have to listen to dozens of flimsy conversations between characters who constantly look and sound depressed about everything. Ultimately, the conversations simply waste minutes of your life - minutes that could be spend watching far better movies.

The characters are terrible, which is a travesty considering all the actors and actresses playing them. As mentioned before, virtually everyone looks and sounds depressed throughout the entire movie, with the exception of the ""bad guy"" who is pretty much always smiling.

Everyone is involved in a side story, but NONE of those stories are fleshed out. For example, Angela Bassett's character talks about how another character is ""her worst nightmare"" (the line is delivered like she's ordering toppings for her pizza) but there's no virtually no explanation of why. You have Robin Tunney and Lou Diamond Phillips playing characters who are in a relationship with about 15 seconds of conversation devoted to some issue about having a baby. James Spader's character is the epitome of every brooding ""tough guy"" written in high school creative writing classes (intended to be dark and mysterious, but just comes off as irritating and dull for no reason).

For whatever reason, Spader's and Bassett's characters dislike each other, but somehow are able to pull it off without ANY sort of passion whatsoever. Yet for some unknown reason, they sleep together (a 5-second shot of two mannequins) and then it's on to the next scene.

Tunney's character is pretty much just a mindless sex robot, void of any sort of human reasoning. Even her few dialogue lines are things like, ""...or an alien sex object."" I mean, really? If she wasn't trying to be so serious when delivering her lines, her character could have been a little funny.

Phillips' character has the most potential. He at least SEEMS concerned with the things that are going on, but his character ultimately does the dumbest and most anti-intuitive things that nobody in his position would ever do.

There's some kind of robot walking around who shows up in about 3 or 4 scenes, each time looking like he's about to fall over. Apparently they can build artificial intelligence into a robot that allows him to navigate around the ship, but they can't prevent him from looking like a 1960's Hollywood idea of a robot that jerks around.

There's also the crew member who is practically in love with the ship computer (""Sweetie"" - really? That's your ship computer's name?). He's actually not so bad until the very end, when he's trying to reason with the ship's computer as to why she needs to do something. Of course, this occurs during a moment that should be climactic, and the back-and-forth logic conversation ruins the moment completely, especially since the computer finally ""gives in"" even though the crew member has made no argument that an AI would find compelling.

The ship computer, Sweetie, is simply annoying. She claims to not have a sense of humor, and then tries to pass off a joke which seems like it SHOULD be funny, but it just fails. Sometimes she seems smart and other times completely idiotic. Sometimes she's extremely precise (""82% of fuel expended"") and other times vague (""chances are... very good""). If she were a human being, it would be completely acceptable to be so inconsistent. A ship computer, on the other hand, should be consistent to the point of being annoying with numbers and calculations.

And then there's the bad guy who seems to limit himself for no apparent reasons other than to obey the screenplay. He's like one of those goons that circles around the hero, waiting for his turn to charge in solo to be beaten up. Imagine an evil superman that simply sits down and waits whenever he's off-camera. Once the camera is back on him, it's time to resume evil!!! It pretty much destroys his capacity to be sinister or threatening.

And the movie ends the same way it begins - with a giant facepalm and rolling of eyes. In my opinion, if a movie ends with you rolling your eyes, it sucked. If a movie ends and you think it's terrible but you don't care because you've made a game out of how many times a character says a certain word, then at least you found a way to enjoy it. This movie is just terrible in an unenjoyable way.

If you enjoyed Event Horizon, then you're better off watching that again than watching this. It has far superior characters, script, and screenplay. Or, if you want something similar but a little newer (2007), watch Sunshine. You'll still get the horror-comes-aboard-when-a-lone-spaceship-tries-to-answer-a-distress-call experience, but with characters that you might actually care a little about, and far better dialogue.",1459296000,,5840,4.868076535750252

1087471,4,6305922640,"I really enjoyed this movie.  And I'm a serious science-fiction fan.  First, I will concede that I wish the movie had gone deeper in its develop of its scientific theory and pulling some of the character elements together.  Nevertheless, I thought that the concept employed to explain the alien object recovered was BRILLIANT!!!  It was an excellent attempt to blend together creation theory with the existence of other species.  It was very probing.  This movie to me, is a lot like Lucy.  I though that was an excellent sci-fi film as well.  Yes, it left some elements that were untidy, but what it did  do in terms of science-fiction and blending with elements of real scientific theory was excellent.

Angela Bassett as always was phenomenal with the material she was provided.  There isn't a role that she doesn't bring it too.  And James Spader, I've got to admit, I have a crush on him.  I think he's a brilliant, colorful actor.  And who knew his body was ever that buff?  Total hottie in this movie.  I know he's older know but perhaps he'll choose to revisit that level of fitness.  I sure would love to see that on The Blacklist.  In any event, I thought the movie was great for it did.  View it through this lens and give it a shot!",1457308800,,1244,4.5225225225225225

1088715,1,6305922640,"This is at its core, a pretty average attempt at a generic sci first story.  But the major problems arise from the fact that so much of every element of the movie is executed so poorly.

It's a little bit of a sci first horror, like Event Horizon, except much tamer, and I would say much more executive meddled with.  It feels like it tries to go in too many directions.  It tries to be smart, and fails.  It tries to be self aware, and fails.  It tries to be a little scary, and fails.  And at the end it tries to profound, and fails.

The acting and characters are serviceable at best.  The actors did their best with what they were given.  It's the writing and dialogue that really bring the performances down.

The special effects look their age.  They weren't great when the movie came out, and they are worse now.  Some elements are visually interesting, but nothing here is really worth checking out if you want a special effects feast.

This movie just doesn't do any one particular thing well, and as a result it just feels some really bland and boring movie cliche soup.  I can't recommend this movie to anyone.  It doesn't even work as an entertaining bad film.

1089215,4,6305922640,"This is one of my favorite science fiction action movies to watch when I'm not hung up on plot holes and just want to feel tickled with good sci-fi.  I know it sounds like a strange recommendation but this is not a bad movie.

What it has that's cool: James Spader completely hulked out with muscles like you've never seen him before, hand held camera realism, Lou Diamond Phillips, Peter Facinelli, a treasure / bomb / 9th dimensional creation element designed by aliens to keep renewing the universe and eliminate competing advanced cultures.

The acting is excellent good but unfortunately the characters aren't fleshed out.  You never really get a sense why the characters are doing what they are doing.  Even if they are just doing what they are doing for fun, there is no sense of that.  It's hard to sense why the doctor, played by Angela Basset is she's so cold to everyone.  And why is James Spader's character, Nick so cold.  I would have loved more backstory on these characters, maybe some flash backs.  That is why this review is missing a star. I feel these actors were under utilized, especially Lou Diamond Phillips. He's an amazing actor and he's just playing a grunt in this.

The most dialogue comes from Peter Facinelli as Carl.  Besides being the bad guy having being the doctor's ex, it's not certain what he did to her to make her so pissed and scared of him.  Did he hurt her feelings or did he try to kill her?  It's so non specific. The character isn't very smart either.  His treasure is a bomb?!

Most of the effects still hold up. The interior of the ship is very authentic looking.  It brought more validity to the movie.

In summary, I love this movie despite it's faults, because I enjoyed the grouping of these actors together and that kick-ass 9th dimensional object.  What a cool concept.  James Spader is a fascinating actor to watch and I just love seeing him on screen with Angela Basset.",1454371200,2,1926,4.578947368421052

1089517,3,6305922640,"Somewhere in this movie lies some great possibilities that seem to have never surfaced. Supernova is a combination of cool sci-fi and bad execution. It's a story that seems to have been told many times before, and Supernova doesn't do anything to break away. It's not really bad movie, but at the same time it's not a good one either. The film just sits there in mediocrity overall. I hear the script was rewritten several times, and the footage was re-shot and re-edited even more. This shows. Supernova is mediocre when you put summarize the whole of its parts.

Supernova is about an emergency medical rescue vessel, Nightingale 229, getting a direct distress call from a long abandoned lunar mining operation (Titan 37). The trip to Titan 37 severely damaged the Nightingale and killed its captain. What they find is a lone survivor and a strange alien object. Only this stranger turns out not to be who he says he is, and is bent on killing the rest of the crew so he can keep the artifact for himself. This is kind of where the movie falls off the rails. At first it's fascinating as you discover Nightingale's crew and its operations. Once the plot moves from discovery to a  ""trapped with a killer"" storyline it feels like nothing else the film presented mattered anymore.

I think this is where the script, shooting and editing changes really show. Supernova establishes a number of interesting things that never show anything for it. James Spader plays a hotshot pilot who is a recovering junkie, and at first you get some great development on this little side story. Then nothing else. It feels like an idea that was going to be useful in the film, but then forgotten. This happens more than once. Like the ship's mainframe being modified to a point of having the potential to turn the plot around yet doesn't. Lots of little character details come and go. It feels like the movie sweeps all this interesting stuff and does a whole, ""Nevermind about all that. Lets pick up the pace and focus on a killer on the loose"" and that just doesn't jibe right for me.

If the movie was only about the mashup of changes that killed what could have been a good script was enough it would be easy to write Supernova off completely. However the movie really does have a lot going for it. For you sci-fi techie nuts out there this movie has some pretty cool concepts. Like how the Nightingale travels faster than light. It's a dimensional jump instead of hyperspace or wormholes or any of your standard FTL concepts, and it looks really cool. So cool I would love to get a technical manual on the movie. That manual would have more than the ship on it as there are lots of other cool details going on in this film that would make such a book a cool buy. Also the acting is really good. James Spader has always been good at playing characters who are a little off or with complex histories, and he knocks this one out of the park. I can really say the same for all the actors, even the ones that die early. It really is a good cast, and they do a lot to to make this broken script work.

Special effects are slightly hit and miss. From what I hear the movie's budget wasn't that big so I can't fault them too much on this. However the Nightingale is all CG, and sometimes it looks real and sometimes it doesn't. Some scenes are obviously CGI touch ups as well. It's not horrible, and movies released in 2000 have done a ton worse with more money at hand, but you should still be aware it's not perfect. The music score feels odd to me as well. Like the music doesn't necessarily fit completely. There are moments when the music feels like it's just there so you don't get bored with the silence.

So Supernova is not a well-loved film, but that doesn't mean there isn't an audience for it. Scream Factory (which is essentially the wonderful Shout! Factory) took it upon themselves to make sure this forgotten film gets a good high definition release. It's not a reference level transfer, but that may be due to the source material more than Scream Factory's efforts. They did a lot to make the imagery stand out and the muted colors of the film to actually come out with a lot more clarity than I remember on the DVD. There is still some obvious dirt, but I'm okay with that. Makes me feel like I'm seen a reel to reel film in the theater. For audio you get DTS-HD Master Audio for both the original stereo mix and a 5.1 surround mix. The surround it good in lots of parts, but feels strained or forced in others. I prefer the stereo mix overall for this reason, and because it's the original audio presentation. The extras are a surprisingly well rounded for a film like this. It's not a lot of content, and I would have loved to have gotten a commentary from at least somebody involved with directing or editing. However what you get is good.

Making of Supernova - Most films gloss over their problems and try to paint a rosy picture of the production process, hoping if they believe in the movie so will you. This documentary doesn't sugar coat it, which makes it a good viewing if you want to know what really happened to this film.

Deleted Scenes - There are a lot of deleted scenes, which should be obvious with all the editing done. Some are very interesting and some I'm glad stayed on the cutting room floor. This, along with the making of featurette, do a lot to paint a picture on how difficult this film was.

Alternate Ending - This would have been a real downer if it was the theatrical release (the universe dies in the end). At the same time I wish they would have kept some of it. I like the idea of how our killer came to an end better than on the theatrical cut.

Supernova is right there in the middle of the plane between good and bad. There is enough bad in the way the story unfolds and was presented to not like the film. Yet there is enough character development, acting, and attention to detail on the conceptual design to make me not hate it. If you are a science fiction fan, and can find this movie in the discount bin I would say go ahead and waste your money on it. The whole package with the extras I think would be worth a $5-$10 experience. If all you care about is whether or not the film is overall good then maybe rent/Netflix this film if you have time to waste. Supernova had some real potential, but to be honest I don't even know if it's original vision would have been good enough.",1429315200,,6421,4.401853411962931

1089520,4,6305922640,"Its always interesting to go back and watch movies made by actors who have moved on to better times. The small role in a long forgotten flick or the starring role in a movie that few ever discovered, each one gives us a glimpse at a star in the making. With the success of THE BLACKLIST there are a number of James Spader movies being rediscovered. How nice it is to see a movie that had so many problems but that turned out to be pretty good come out finally on blu-ray thanks to Shout Factory.

SUPERNOVA arrived in theaters amid a number of science fiction outer space films that were recent blockbusters. Ever since ALIEN captured audiences imaginations years before the outer space genre had seen a re-emergence as a viable cash generating movie experience. Some were good, some bad, some high end budget and other low end. This particular film started low, got bigger, had problems getting made and ended up tossed out with little to no fanfare. Its only through fandom and the home market that it got any attention.

Up front know that the movie was originally begun by writer/director Walter Hill, famous for his films like 48 HOURS, THE WARRIORS and STREETS OF FIRE, but he left after a number of issues with the studio responsible for this film. Having shot most of the film it was left in the hands of Jack Sholder, another solid director who took the footage shot and turned it into a final releasable film. Of course this was after Francis Ford Coppola put his hands on it for a short time as well. With so many people trying to make the film their own it ended up suffering more than being helped. As is the case when studio suits attempt to put their two cents in while silencing the creators behind any movie, something definitely gets lost in translation. Much of this can be discovered in the very nice behind the scenes extra Shout Factory has included on this release.

But back to the movie. The spaceship Nightingale, a medical emergency ship, receives a mysterious signal from deep space requesting help. The distance to reach the location of the signal requires a jump through space where the crew must be enclosed or risk their bodies being manipulated into something frightening. Which is what happens to the 6 man teams captain played by Robert Forster in what amounts to more of a cameo than a complete role.

Now in charge new pilot Nick Vanzant (Spader) assumes control of the ship and trying to gauge the amount of damage done. Needing 17 hours to recharge the cells necessary for a return trip and only 17 yours and 11 minutes worth of fuel left after a meteor damages a fuel tank, theyll be cutting it close. The ship requesting their presence flies toward them without radio contact and makes a rough landing. On board is Larson (Peter Facinelli), the son of the miner from the nearby moon that was mined in the past who sent the distress call. That man was also an ex-lover of the ships doctor Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett).

Along with him Larson has brought an object found in the deep recesses of the moon, something he feels could gain each of them an incredible amount of money. But as this object slowly exposes itself to various members of the crew it becomes obvious that it may not be worth the risk needed to take it back home. Spader plans on disposing of it before leaving for home and then sets out to see if there is any fuel left on the moon they can use to survive.

But the effects of the object first on Larson who has been exposed to it the longest and then on crew member Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips) makes things take a turn for the worse. As more and more is revealed the crew of this ship might find themselves surviving less than the needed 17 hours it takes to recharge. With Spader in jeopardy on the moons surface (as well as below) and the members of the crew onboard threatened by a very deadly Larson, just exactly what is going on is slowly revealed.

The movie looks fantastic considering all things involved. Not only are low costs sets utilized to their fullest capabilities the cinematography is well done with a floating effect used to convey the sense of outer space from shot to shot. The special effects are well done and not overused making them a part of the story without making them THE story here.

The acting seen on screen is above that regularly associated with science fiction films of the time. Ive seen great actors turn in bad performances in top notch films but here they all make their parts believable and real, something not easy to achieve given the subject matter. My guess is this a combination of great acting, great directing and great editing combined to make what sounded like a mess to begin with into a decent movie.

You might not remember this movie or ever having seen it, even on one of those unheralded showing on HBO or Showtime one night. But if you like science fiction or any of the actors in the film then youll want to give it a watch. Even those who don't like sci-fi might find something to enjoy here. For myself I can see pulling this one down from the shelf every so often to give it another watch.",1427068800,7,5115,4.4973089343379975

1089565,3,6305922640,"I remember seeing Supernova back in 2000 when it originally came out on DVD. Like most people, I thought it looked great at the time, but really didn't have much else going for it. My opinion hasn't really changed since re-visiting it after the movies recent Blu-ray upgrade by Scream Factory. The special effects and design are still the highlight of a sci-fi film that suffers from simply maintaining the status genre quo and offering nothing new.

The medical ship Nightingale 229 travels through deep space in the early 22nd century taking on search and rescue missions its assigned to. Its six-member crew includes a Captain and Pilot (Robert Forster), a co-pilot (James Spader), a medical officer (Angela Bassett, a medical technician (Luo Diamond Phillips), a search and rescue paramedic (Robin Tunney), and a computer technician (Wilson Cruz). When their vessel, the Nightingale 229, answers an emergency distress signal from a comet mining operation in a distant galaxy, the crew soon finds itself in danger from the mysterious young man they rescue, the alien artifact he's smuggled aboard, and the gravitational pull of a giant star about to supernova. The resulting explosion will be the most massive explosion in the universe.

What was originally planned as a low-budget study of human relationships amongst the stars quickly mutated into a rather lackluster action yarn about picking up a stray and his alien artifact. Of course we all know the object cant be good and the whole situation goes south very quickly in a matter of 90 minutes. Its evident by the way the movie progresses in a very choppy and rushed pace that there was more to the story than what we get here. There were 15 minutes of deleted scenes for the movie included, so I can only imagine there has to be even more footage lying in a box somewhere out there.

The cast would be considered an ensemble these days since most of the actors have gone on to do bigger and better things since Supernova. James Spader, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robert Forster, and Angela Bassett were already established stars at the time of this movies release. Peter Facinelli went on to play the patriarch of the Cullen vampire clan, Carlisle, in The Twilight Saga. Robin Tunney worked on Prison Break and continues as a member of the cast of The Mentalist. Here they just walk around angry with grim looks on their faces.

Supernova is rated R for sci-fi action violence and sensuality / nudity. There are at least two topless shots of Robin Tunney and a rather explicit love scene. Director Walter Hill (operating under the pseudonym Thomas Lee) was definitely fascinated with the human body. He stalls on one shot of Peter Facinellis backend for what seems like an eternity. Angela Bassett gets her opportunity to bare all, albeit in the shadows, as well. Theres an acceptable amount of gore as Facinellis character continuously gets beat upon. However, even this aspect of the film seems uneven. Sometimes we get to see the carnage, while at others its edited out nice and neat.

Although there really isn't much going on here in a spiritual sense, one line of dialogue that James Spader utters stood out to me. When the crew is coming to grips with the chain of events Peter Facinellis character has unraveled, he makes a bold statement. Spader proclaims, What if they didn't crucify Christ, but they did!"" He uses such an extreme example to explain that it doesnt matter what couldve been. Whats more important is dealing with what is. Angela Bassetts character also dramatically makes a comparison between aliens and God when she says, Whoever they are, they're as smart as God and a lot less nice. I don't think so.

Scream Factorys Blu-ray debut of Supernova is presented in 1080p Widescreen (2.36:1) with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. Special features include a Making of Supernova feature, deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and theatrical trailer.

Supernova isn't completely void of any entertainment value. It just lacks the endeavor to be anything more than a slick sci-fi action yarn. It will remind you of the awkward era of filmmaking when studios were transitioning from working with real models and sets and moving into the arena of CGI effects. If youve ran out of other alien encounter movies, this will tide you over until something new and bolder comes along.",1421020800,,4341,4.8979591836734695

About half way through someone says, ""We gotta do something"" so it's Blair Witch filming (shaky camera, close ups, jerky actions, etc).  And there's sex and more sex and more sex.  And, oh yeah, there's a supernova wannabe.  Like others have said, it was derivative of about a dozen movies.

It constantly plays it safe with the slasher/""Alien"" horror, but it also tries to integrate a cerebral subplot about a mysterious, godlike alien race... and then drops it like a hot coal. It has too many seeds of excellence, and too few seedlings.

The medical patrol ship Nightingale receives a distress call from an abandoned mining station on a rogue planet. Despite some malfunctions in the dimensional stabilization pods, they make a dimensional jump to get there. But when they arrive, the captain is accidentally killed and the ship ends up trapped in orbit around a blue giant.

While they wait for the engines to recharge, the crew rescues a mysterious young man (Peter Facinelli) from the planet. He claims to be the son of Dr. Kaela Evers' (Angela Basset) abusive former lover, Karl Larsen. And he has brought something with him: a mysterious extradimensional artifact.

Evers begins analyzing the artifact, and discovers that it's something far more amazing -- and terrifying -- than any human has ever seen before. Meanwhile, acting captain Nick Vanzant (James Spader) starts to become suspicious of the young man. Their visitor begins manipulating the crew around him -- and then starts murdering people who get in his way.

""Supernova"" = ""Alien"" + ""Event Horizon"" + a dash of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" + a dash of ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan.""  But while it's derivative, the ideas behind it are good -- particularly the strong special effects and the ninth-dimensional artifact. In fact, the most intriguing aspect of the movie is the revelation of unspeakably powerful, cruel aliens that create and destroy life at whim. They are mysterious, inscrutable...

... so of course, the artifact turns out to be basically a macguffin, and the existence of the powerful aliens leads to nothing. Why? Because that clearly isn't interesting.

Instead, ""Supernova"" is basically a very slow-moving slasher movie. It's obvious that the man they found is evil, manipulative and superpowered, yet they let him wander freely through the ship, messing with people's heads and eventually going full psycho on them. Most of the other scenes lapse into tedium, with people just wandering around and occasionally having zero-G softcore sex.

James Spader and Angela Bassett are far too good for this movie -- honestly, the development of their hesitant romance probably would have been dull with lesser actors. She's a fiery doctor with a rather sad past, and he's a reticient loner with an even worse past. Most of the other actors are either forgettable (Robin Tunney) or downright bad (Facinelli).

Two good actors and an interesting subplot aren't enough to keep ""Supernova"" from being a mediocre mess -- while it has some good ideas, the right ones aren't allowed to bloom. Give it a pass.",1366502400,,3061,4.972602739726027

The End",1336435200,,474,4.7682926829268295
1090000,4,6305922640,"This film is not really a masterpiece and I understand those reviewers who gave it only two or three stars, as it definitely could have been better with some effort from the scenarist, but I still rather enjoyed it, for numerous following reasons:

1. The cast.

James Spader is not exactly an actor associated with action movies and before watching ""Supernova"" I would have problems to picture him as an action hero. But in this film he is VERY convincing as a surprisingly tough, clever and coolheaded pilot of a spaceship, who after recovering from drug addiction is granted a second chance, at the condition of taking the difficult, dangerous and not so well paid job on board of a rescue vessel operating in deep space. His performance surprised and impressed me.

Angela Bassett is a very good actress and a very beautiful woman and honestly I think that in this film she is at her most gorgeous. She plays the doctor working on board of the rescue vessel and she is impressive with her display of competence, dignity and calm authority - and that even when she is completely naked...

Peter Facinelli became worldly famous for his role of Dr Carlisle Cullen in ""Twilight"" saga - here he plays a young man named Larson who survived a disaster on a distant mining colony and is found still alive by the deep space rescue ship. Considering how noble is Carlisle in ""Twilight"" movies it becomes immediately obvious how gifted and versatile an actor Peter Facinelli is, because his caracter in ""Supernova"" is completely different - and he is very credible in portraying it! If any ""Twilight"" fan wants to see how Carlisle Cullen could look and act if he became a ""regular"" nomad vampire hunting humans and ""playing with his food"" (like James, Victoria and Laurent) - well, have a look at Peter Facinelli in this film...

Lou Diamond Phillips, who plays Yerzy Penalosa, one of the medical nurses, has a smaller role here, but it is always a pleasure to see him on the screen. Robin Tunney plays another nurse, Danika Lund - she is also Yerzy's girlfriend - and she is a very pleasant presence.

There is also one more very interesting ""woman"" on board of the ship - Sweetie, the main computer. Her beautiful and sensual voice (borrowed from actress Vanessa Marshall) is a very important element of the film and her relationship with ship's informatician, Benjamin Sotomayor (Wilson Cruz) is a very original thing.

2. The design of space ship and the mining colony.

They were very well done and more generally the effects in this movie are at a good level. The scenes of ""jumping"" into hyperspace are excellent, the alien blue ""sun"" is very impressive and the grim, industrial bunkers of the mining colony are also quite credible. OK, it is certain that there were some elements here borrowed from ""Aliens"" and also possibly ""Outland"", but the final results are very good.

3. The reason behind the title of the film

Here I can not be very specific, because I do not want to provide spoilers, but somewhere in the middle of the film you may begin to ask yourself ""But why the heck they called this movie 'Supernova'?"". Well, there is a reason and in my modest opinion a rather good one, but you must be patient and wait almost until the end. The only thing I can tell here is that this film explains quite well why we never heard any radio signals from alien civilizations - and when one considers all the implications of the solution of the mystery in ""Supernova"", they are rather terrifying... Frankly, the conclusion of this little movie makes the space a place even more frightening than the one described in ""Alien"" (but just to be clear, this film is nowhere as good or as scary as ""Alien"")...

4. The question of motherhood denied

There are two women on board of the rescue ship, Dr Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett) and nurse Danika Lund (Robin Tunney) - and they both can not have children. Dr Evers was in the past so horribly abused by her partner, that she was left barren - and so scarred emotionnally that she decided to work in the deep space to get as far as possible from her tormentor, even though he went to prison. Danika is still young and healthy, but it seems that in this future not so brave world getting an administrative authorization to have a child is very difficult and she must be certain that she chooses the right partner to not be rejected. This issue of motherhood denied has profound consequences for the action of the movie and allows also for quite a unique and very moving finale.
---
Bottom line, although I am the first to admit that this film is not a ""great"" movie, it is still a honest watch and any science-fiction amateur will probably enjoy watching it, if only once. And if by any chance you decide to interrupt the watching in the middle, please, at least see the last two minutes - I found them quite unique and very touching.",1328745600,,4875,4.6101499423298735
1090001,1,6305922640,"Probably one of the worst movies ever executed using a big Hollywood budget.

""Heaven's Gate"" may be a classic compared to this car crash. The problem was they began shooting without a coherent script, resulting in a disjointed mess with genuine menace, but no real focus and not a single likable character.

There was no amount of editing magic or special effects that could fix it if the story on paper was already this bad.

The best actor on the production played a character killed off in the first 15 minutes of the film. The others, even Angela Bassett and the gorgeous Robin Tunney, are at best miscast, especially James Spader, who pulls duty in this film as a buff action hero, a role completely outside of his scope.

It might be more accurate to say that the characters as written could never be played by actors of any caliber at all. This is just bad storytelling from the opening fade-in.

One note: if they had released it with the original ending (viewable as one of the extras) it would have gone down in history as the biggest downer ending ever put on film.

1090003,4,6305922640,"I skimmed some of the bad reviews of this movie before watching it, and having seen it, I feel like these guys must have watched a different movie by mistake. Supernova isn't top-shelf sci-fi by any stretch of the imagination, but decent acting, plot, special effects, and settings make it a fun and enjoyable ride just the same. Speaking of rides, this movie might have one of the most stylish modes of FTL transport I've ever seen. Words don't really do it justice, but let me try: a beam of light shoots out of both ends of the ship, it gets enveloped in lightning, and then it rides the beam of light into a sureal acid trip. At the other end, another beam of light, like a spear from God, shoots out of nowhere and the ship arrives riding that beam like a monorail on steroids. Oh, and did I mention that if you're not in a special protective chamber when the ship jumps, you end up inside out?

Two things bugged me about this movie, but only a little:
1) The movie casts Robert Forster as the captain, goes to all the trouble to establish some personality quirks and flesh out the character a bit, and then kills him. It seems odd and wasteful.
2) While the actors are convincing, sometimes the lines and emotions they're acting out don't make sense in context, like when they make wisecracks just minutes after losing their captain, or confess dangerous secrets to total strangers.

There are a few minor plot holes and things that feel tacked-on, but it's no big deal. This is just one of those movies you have to enjoy without thinking about it too deeply.

Well, the acting was decent.  The plot had a couple of holes, but not too unpleasant.  Mainly, I find it hard to believe that the DSC's are an adequate safeguard.  There was no explanation of how the ship was able to withstand a dimension jump, while the DSC's kept the crew safe and sound.  Also the extradimensional (more than three dimensions)explosive changing a human being in the physiological ways mentioned is a little far fetched.  The story just wasn't that deep, and I get the feel that it was just a test for special effects, but despite all of this I enjoyed the injection of a hyperdimensional object into the plot; that, and I suppose in some ways I identify with James Spader's character.  All in all I liked it because for a moment it captured a picture of what life in deep space is like--but only a snapshot.  It didn't really satisfy, so much as it teased.

1090107,3,6305922640,"If you were around back in the turn of the most recent century, you may remember a brief resurgence in science fiction theatrical attention: Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Wing Commander, Titan A.E., the re-imagined Lost in Space, Virus, Pitch Black, Mission to Mars, Red Planet; it was a virtual parade of space sci-fi that had my friends and I never far from the ticket booth as the 1990s became the early 2000's.

Amidst that procession came Supernova; a relatively under-hyped piece that more closely resembled horror-tones in its gritty futuristic space tale of predecessors ""ALIEN"" or ""Event Horizon"" over the more user-friendly nature of say George Lucas's universe.

The tale centers on a deep-space medical vessel (the Nightingale) that receives a distress call from a lunar mining colony some 3,000 light-years away.  Due to the vast distance, their only option for reaching the anguishing colonists is to exercise a risky space-fold jump that entails the atomic disassembly then reassembly of all of the matter onboard (including the crew). And speaking of, the crew is fairly ragtag group of characters led by Captain Marley (Robert Forster), an ex-drug-addict pilot Nick Vanzant (James Spader), Dr. Evers (Angela Bassett), computer tech Benj (Wilson Cruz), and finally Yerzy and Danika (Lou Diamond Phillips and Robin Tunney respectively): a promiscuous couple seemingly chosen simply to meet the film's T&A quotient.

Now interestingly enough, moviegoers back in Y2K would have enjoyed a PG-13 cut of the film with the female topless nudity almost completely removed from the film while the DVD release benefits from a Rated R edit that includes much more sexuality (mostly thanks to Robin Tunney's bare breasts) and graphic violence.

But anyway, the Nightingale arrives to the distant moon only to discover that it is in dangerously close orbit to a blue-giant (a star that's nearing the end of its life-cycle) and all that remains of the once-flourishing colony is a single individual with a story that raises suspicion on many levels.  Worse still, since the jump coordinates placed the ship amidst an uncharted debris field, a collision with a meteor upon reassembly causes a massive tear in the fuel tank that results in the Nightingale's near-complete fuel loss.

In case my summation of the film's plot and the 91-minute runtime fail to suggest it, rest assured that the pacing is rip-roaring quick (unlike say, ALIEN) with the action coming on nearly immediately and never really easing up until the final credits roll.

Visually, the film actually manages to succeed with a consistency between its understated special effects and nicely lit (see: gritty) interior sets.  Perhaps the film's greatest strength in fact could be considered its ability to establish a dark and foreboding tone of the dangers of space travel and the claustrophobia associated with living on a spacecraft.  If forced to draw comparisons to other motion pictures in this category, I would state with certainty that Supernova's feel harkens to Paul WS Anderson's Event Horizon or the later Danny Boyle film, Sunshine.

So let's recap: Pacing is brisk, effect work is solid, casting is spot-on, character development is passable, and the premise succeeds on many levels.  So why the mediocre review score?  Good question!  The answer is that, while the picture doesn't fail in any single category, neither does it manage to impress.  Don't take my word for it: The production was plagued with problems to the point where originally attached director, Geoffrey Wright quit over a script dispute a mere five weeks before principal photography was set to begin. The replacement director (Walter Hill) literally walked onto the set into a wall of creative differences with the studio; which upon viewing the completed work was unhappy enough to request a re-edit from Francis Ford Coppola. Hill, rightfully angered, apparently ended up requesting that his name be removed from the credits instead opting for a contemporary version of the infamous ""Alan Smithee"" designation: ""Thomas Lee"".

Behind-the-scenes drama aside, some flaws made the transition to the finished product as well.  Namely the editing feels a bit eschew, with some sections being dusted over where one would expect emphasis and emphasis on sequences that do little to advance the overall plot.  Additionally, and perhaps the result of swapping directors, the direction is a bit cobby and lackluster.  I guess the best way to articulate the feeling it inspires would be to say that directorial work, while passable, never fully instills that sense of earning the viewer's confidence in just letting go and being swept away by the prose.

In all, Supernova was a bit of a pleasant surprise for me and I attribute it to a flood of negative reviews and poor press that my pre-purchase research retuned.  The movie is generally frowned upon by the media (and apparently has been since its initial release) and, while certainly not a masterpiece, succeeds on many of the same levels that make pictures like Event Horizon and Sunshine successful: Space is a formidable place and a natural backdrop for a scientifically-laced horror tale.  If you can go into the picture with that mind-set, it will manage to deliver a pretty exciting hour and a half's worth of entertainment and the graphically thorough R-Rated version adds a little bit of welcomed intensity to the package.",1275436800,2,5441,5.152099886492622

Here are some thing about Twilight and The Twilight Saga New Moon
The big-screen adaptation of Twilight, Stephenie Meyer's bestselling vampire romance, is aimed squarely at its key demographic: teen girls whose idea of Prince Charming is a brooding, pale, undead teen who could kill you instantly at any moment. Such a prince is more fascinating than frightening to new girl Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), who moves to the rainy-gray town of Forks, Wash., to live with her dad (Billy Burke), the local sheriff who's puzzled by a series of ""animal attacks."" On her first day at school, Bella appears to (visibly) nauseate her lab partner, Edward (Robert Pattinson). Turns out the scent of her blood is this vampire's ""brand of heroin,"" and his struggle not to kill her causes an irresistible pull toward her. Whether he's attracted for the normal reasons or because she smells especially sweet to him is vague in the book and even less clear on-screen; nonetheless, Bella falls hopelessly in love with Edward, which sets her on a dangerous path when a few nomad vampires show up in town, one particularly keen on tracking the human. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen), Twilight is full of funny moments--not all of which are intentional--and the casting, from Stewart to Bella's self-absorbed friend Jessica (Anna Kendrick) is spot-on. The weakest link, unfortunately, is Pattinson. While he certainly looks the part, his Edward could have used an extra injection of testosterone (Pattinson, who is British, used James Dean as a model for his American accent). In scenes where he growls about the temptation to kill those who would harm Bella, or flitting around a forest warning her how dangerous he is, he comes off more like a whimpering puppy than a debonair monster. The good news is, his chemistry with Stewart (particularly in their big kissing scene) is palpable, which, let's face it, is really what matters to Twilight fans most. --Ellen A. Kim
On the DVD
The special features for Twilight kick off with an audio commentary with director Catherine Hardwicke and stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. There's some mumbling and groaning from Stewart (one gets the impression that Stewart is quite similar to her reserved character in the film), some standard behind-the-scenes observations from Hardwicke, and a lot of awkward self-deprecating remarks from Pattinson (of their big kiss, he opines: ""This is quite difficult 'cause I have a really flat head, and so it's quite difficult to get a correct angle.""). What's funny is Pattinson stumping Hardwicke with some basic plot questions, like ""Why doesn't James just kill [Bella when she's packing at her house]?"" While Hardwicke and Stewart attempt to answer, Pattinson doesn't appear satisfied. The deleted and extended scenes include an additional dream-sequence kiss (rightly cut because it took away from the buildup to their first kiss) and more footage of Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre). The seven-part documentary is a pretty thorough look at the development of the film, including stunts, special effects, and the involvement of author Stephenie Meyer. Another featurette looks at the Comic-Con frenzy; however, it spends no time on how the actors were cast, which would have been fun for fans who did all their own mental casting while reading the books. Also included: three music videos and trailers. --Ellen A. Kim Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) doesn't expect much when she moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, until she meets the mysterious and handsome Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson)--a boy who's hiding a dark secret: he's a vampire. As their worlds and hearts collide, Edward must battle the bloodlust raging inside him as well as a coterie of undead that would make Bella their prey. Based on the #1 New York Times best-selling sensation by Stephenie Meyer, Twilight adds a dangerous twist to the classic story of star-crossed lovers.
New Moon, the second in Stephenie Meyer's blockbuster teen-fiction saga adapted for film, is stronger than its predecessor, Twilight. Director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass), taking the helm from Catherine Hardwicke, brings a lighter, more assured touch to the sequel, which continues the star-crossed love story of mortal Bella (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson). Incidentally, Edward is absent for most of the film; after an accident on Bella's birthday reminds Edward that her life is always at risk when he's around, he chooses to abandon her, sending her into a deep depression. The only person who helps her heal her broken heart is her friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner), a member of the Quileute tribe who, as he grows taller, beefier, and more aggressive (with less clothing), comes to realize he's not entirely human either. But even his love for Bella doesn't prevent her from throwing herself in the path of danger, because that's the only time she can see visions of Edward. One such fateful misunderstanding sends Edward into the coven of the Volturi (a sort of vampire Mafia, if you will), where the most dangerous vampires hold both Edward and Bella's fate in their cold, dark hands. Much of New Moon rests on the shoulders of Lautner, so scrawny in Twilight, who famously packed on the muscle to avoid getting recast. He's very nearly successful in carrying the load, but the cheese-tastic beefcake scenes disservice him, and Jacob and Bella's complicated friendship stumbles on its way to any kind of love triangle. Some of that blame lies with Stewart, who understandably holds her emotions close to her chest but reveals much too little (c'mon, even an angsty girl has to be a little joyful in the arms of two different hunks). As is with the book, the film is just a bridge between sagas, so the plot drags and not a lot happens. Fortunately, while Twilight was trapped in its own self-consciousness, the wobbly-legged cast seems to have found stronger footing in New Moon; the jokes come faster, the writing (by Melissa Rosenberg, who also scribed Twilight) is a hair wittier. (Even Pattinson seems more comfortable in Edward's skin.) The Volturi, highlighted by Michael Sheen's Aro and Dakota Fanning's Jane, also make an all-too-brief impression, but at least there's more to look forward to when Eclipse, the third installment, is released. --Ellen A. Kim In the second chapter of Stephenie Meyer's best-selling Twilight series, the romance between mortal Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) grows more intense as ancient secrets threaten to destroy them. When Edward leaves in an effort to keep Bella safe, she tests fate in increasingly reckless ways in order to glimpse her love once more. But when she's saved from the brink by her friend, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), Bella will uncover mysteries of the supernatural world that will put her in more peril than ever before.",1266710400,,10693,5.100399315459213
1090109,4,6305922640,"A medical spacecraft, the Nightingale, receives a distress signal from a mining operation on a rogue moon.  Having watched ""Alien,"" I knew this wasn't good.  Surgeon Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett) learns the distress call is from former lover Karl James Lawson - ""her worst nightmare"" as she refers to him.  Soon, the spacecraft is plunged into a nightmare as it dimension jumps across the universe and finds itself near a blue-white giant sun that is on the verge of a supernova.  To make matters worse, their captain dies and they lose most of their fuel.  According to their calculations, they barely have enough time to rescue the lone survivor and make it back home, with eleven minutes to spare.

  ""Supernova"" quickly turns into a slasher film when the survivor, Troy (Robert Forster), decides to transfer an alien artifact back to Earth.  He traps Nick Vansant (James Spader) on the rogue moon and begins killing the remainder of the crew, which includes Robin Tunney and Lou Diamond Phillips.  Filled with shocking surprises and a stellar cast (all of which, especially the men, look as though they've been doing some serious weight training), this film will satisfy any science fiction horror fan.

  Watch the deleted scenes.  I wish many of them had been left in the film.  They contain more violence and gore and an explanation as to what really happened to Troy's treasure hunting friends.  The alternate ending is very downbeat.  The DVD doesn't have a ""making of"" featurette; however, the collectable booklet provides some interesting background on how and where the film was made along with some scientific background on supernovas.  Furthermore, this R rated version contains some brief scenes of nudity (most involve Tunney) that must not have been present in the PG-13 version.",1231718400,,1795,5.027118644067796

The premise of the film is quite interesting.  In the far future, when deep space travel is commonplace, there are these outer space ambulances which respond to intergalactic ""9-1-1"" calls.  The idea is for these medical ships to patrol certain sectors and thereby be available should there be any medical emergencies on-board other ships or in remote outposts.

One of these ships responds to a strange distress call, and they run into a situation that none of the medically trained personnel are trained for.  A strange alien object has an insidious influence of members of the crew.

The film does a good job of giving you that ""stranded in deep outer space feel,"" similar to movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UJ48SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

1090202,3,6305922640,"Expecting lots of spectacular Star War's pyrotechnics out in space, I was in for a downer of everything lackluster, even the performances of the stars.  Always I have gotten a kick out of James Spader's varied roles (he is a versatile actor and a delight to look at), but this one is low-key.  In fact, you might think you were in a well-run library, with all of the dialogue so prosaic with no emotional whatsoever.  Granted, some of the crew were supposedly sub-humans, like automatons with no sense of humor which was not programmed into them.  However, they could take the place of women for the men's every need.  The special effects were like primitive ""Lost in Space"" episodes in color no less.

There was nothing in the celesterial atmosphere to indicate a Supernova.  They talk about one, but act as though they really don't know what it is.  The alien, Karl, tricks Nighingale to come into a dangerous area of outer space and eventually dispenses with the crew.  He is cruel, vicious to each and every one on board.  They think he is one of them who had changed to become younger and stronger.  Not so, he has turned into a monster and fights dirty.  That is human; say goodbye, Karl.  He showed no regret about using the young girl and tossing her out into space to meet her death.

This performance was lacking in every way; it was anything but super!  Don't be negative?  What's there to say about someone talking for 45 mintues in a monotone.  We die so that stars can be reborn.  Ridiculous.  Stars die all the time in outer space, and there is always another to take their places -- just like humans on earth.

My biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed, again and again, due to the fact that the script writers and director couldn't keep the story straight.

There is a homage to Asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm. That would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film. There are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible.

That said, it was a bit enjoyable. The cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given. If the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked, maybe I would have cared what happened to them.

The dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say, ""Oooh, cool"".

Good premise, good effects, good acting, but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film.",1154217600,2,1082,4.39
1090204,5,6305922640,"I actually really liked this movie, I thought it was fun, fairly intelligent, sexy, humorous, quite suspenseful and the special effects were pretty good too.

Okay so I am a fan of Angela Bassett and James Spader, and they were pretty hot in this movie you have to admit!  Angela plays Dr Kaela Evers the ship's medical officer and James is the ship's hunky co-pilot Nick Vanzant who has a lustful eye on Kaela who isn't that interested in him much to his disappointment.

The action takes place on medical spaceship and were an alien artefact is secreted aboard by a miner the aforesaid medical spaceship and its crew rescue who unbeknown to them is slowly mutating into something not quite human courtesy of the alien artefact.  There is also a ship's computer called Sweetie with a female persona who is pretty much running the show from a technology point of view and a star that is about to go supernova.

One by one the crew are picked off by the demented miner, who has mayhem on his mind, and soon only Spader and Bassett are left on the ship which is in danger of being sucked into the gravitational field of the crumbling star and there is only one life pod left and to share it means the possibility of Kaela and Nick's DNA merging together which it does partially, in that they both end up with one blue and one green eye but miracle of miracle's Kaela also ends up pregnant, a condition she never expected to be in!

All in all it is a pretty good sci-fi film, shame it was panned so much because it is well worth watching but I have noticed over the years I have been reviewing films that the more intelligent the sci-fi film on offer, the less likely it is appreciated by the ""green slime and mega-blood and guts"" brigade as I call them.  You know who you are guys, if it isn't gung ho with no plot then you don't want to know!

Watch this film and enjoy, that is if you have a brain in your head that appreciates something that comes under, ""intelligent"" and ""thoughtful"", however if this is too much for your brain cells, give it a miss and watch something easier like Star Wars or Men in Black, great films that are lots of fun but totally lacking in anything remotely intelligent from beginning to end.",1145232000,69,2221,4.4

The biggest problem for me is that I never truly understood just what was in the alien artifact, and also the dramatic change in appearance of Karl Larson after he is shot.  There is an unusual amount of meaningless sex and nudity scenes, almost as if they were used purely for padding and lustful viewers.

Peter Facinelli, looking and sounding amazingly like Tom Cruise, commands his scenes with a suave menace.  James Spader is too inanimate to be likeable; Angela Bassett is too cold to be sympathized with.  Robin Tunney and Lou Diamond Phillips are likewise annoyingly cloy.

Throw in a ridiculously precocious ship's computer and a downright silly robot, and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space.

6) The deleted scenes are numerous and MUST-sees.

1090303,2,6305922640,"Ultimately this film is not as good as it could have been, but it does have things to recommend it so don't be fooled by some of the other reviews. Yes, the plot does have echoes of Alien but Walter Hill wrote and produced Alien, and if people would care to take note Alien has more in common stylistically with the films of Walter Hill than any of Ridley Scott's subsequent output.
The Camera, Sound and Lighting are all excellent, as are the special effects. The problems with the film stem mostly from the editing, resulting in poor character development and slow pacing. This can be attributed to production problems during and after the shoot. Walter Hill took over from another director shortly after filming began and when he was not given additional funding to add scenes he removed himself from the production process altogether. Francis Ford Coppola was then drafted in to edit the film whereupon Hill stated he would put his name back on the film if the cut met with his approval. Obviously it didn't.
A fine cast is assembled here and whilst none could be accused of being A-list most have proven themselves as fine actors in the past. The premise of the film has our cast aboard a sort of intergalactic breakdown service. They answer distress calls and all have defined roles within that. They answer a distress call from what appears to be an abandoned mining colony and immediately things are not right. The call is directly to the ship and the caller is Angela Basset's ex, apparently not a nice man, but when they arrive it appears it is from his son and he has some sort of alien artifact. The rest you can guess. Where films like this distinguish themselves is in the detail and the style and Supernova has plenty of both if you pay attention.
Hints as to how much better the film could have been can be found in the deleted scenes. Here we can see where some of the character development went as well as some of the tension. The deleted scenes also hint at a slightly different style with the audience as more casual observer than participant. Gripes about poor plot development or sparse dialogue seem to be ignoring the origins of this film. Sci-Fi thrillers are hardly renowned for their storylines, you can write the plots of the Alien movies on the back of a stamp. And as for dialogue, well personally I prefer a film that doesn't breastfeed me. Learn to pay attention to the visuals. This is a film after all, not a book or a radio play.
Okay so the film is still a failure but at least its an ambitious one that treats its audience with some respect, rather than the contempt that we have come to expect.
Not for everyone because of the unusually slow pace but worthwhile if you are interested in making films and want an easy film to dissect where they went wrong.",1049760000,4,2793,4.532673267326732
1090304,1,6305922640,"What's the biggest crime? a bad movie you can't even laugh at.
Normally when you go to the cinema, buy or rent a [bad] movie, the least you can expect it is to be funny! This movie attempts to be serious sci-fi, but serious as in dull, boring.... it just takes ages for this movie to start, because it attempts to introduce the main characters with long, awkwardly written scenes. We are introduced to the whole wooden crew and the dreadfully pedestrian production design. More than a spaceship it looks like someone's attic... the only decent futuristic set seems to be the cryogenic hybernation chamber. There's also the strangest robot you'll ever see in a movie, just look at the way it walks, bouncing stupidly with each step.
well, they receive a distress call (thank god, something at last that will stop the pointless character un-development), and so they all pop into the cryogenic pods wetting their pants because hyperspace jumps usually turn these people into lasagna... and so, that's what happens to the ship's captain (the actor probably was lucky his character died so early in the movie).
they arrive at some asteroid that is being pulled by gravity into a blue giant. As it usually happens with adventure flicks with zero plot, it all suddenly becomes the standard hazard and disaster movie, as the ship struggles to find stable orbit. After ages of boring blabber and some impecable CGI, that crisis passes, only to have a seemingly rogue shuttlecraft crash into their ship (boy do they have a bad day with collissions!)
onboard the shuttle they find the bad guy and a cosmic doomsday weapon which conveniently, also happens to rejuvenate and mutate humans. This sounds much better written than what you get in the movie, believe me! what you get is more blabber, pointless sex scenes and then silly deaths..
I won't give away the ending just in case you really want to suffer this garbage to the bitter end...
The only high point in this disaster is the good CGI, but that's about it. Don't expect any kind of suspense, or emotion, or metaphysical insight, or whatever.....",1046304000,,2094,4.803324099722992

1090408,5,6305922640,"Thomas Lee (Walter Hill) delivers an astounding sci-fi actioner that was unfairly ignored at the box office, and has received an undeserved rep in critics' circles.
A medical ship receives a distress call from a collapsing moon. A strange man from Angela Bassett's past comes aboard, carrying a mysterious object that can change the course of man and space.
James Spader plays a formerly drug addicted pilot who must take command of the ship. He gives an incredible performance in a role normally reserved for the steroid experiments we call action stars today. Bassett is also good, reminding you she should have won the Oscar for ""What's Love Got To Do With It"". Wilson Cruz is also good as the assistant with a special relationship with the computer. Lou Diamond Phillips, Robin Tunney, and especially Robert Forster do not register much in their screen time.
The film went thorough plenty of post-production problems, and I can only imagine what would have happened if Hill had stayed around, but this is still fantastic science fiction.
A word about the special effects: Holy Hubble! The effects here, even on the small TV I have, were incredible! Digital Domain really outdid themselves, creating a totally believable new world...",1023235200,4,1236,5.034146341463415

The special FX were great. The concept of the hyper jump was very original. Basically you have a space hospital on patrol in deep space that picks up a homicidal killer with an alien nuke from a strange moon. So far so good. The only weak links in the cast are Wilson Cruz and Peter Facinelli. The robot had more personality the Cruz did playing Benjamin. James Spader was very different from his ""Star gate"" roll. One flaw was trying to build too much tension too soon. Let the story build. Once again this is a Hollywood showboat of all FX and little story.

1090410,1,6305922640,"I love science fiction movies, but it's obvious that those set in outer space have been in a rut for some time. Just as it has been long time since man last walked on the moon, it has been over thirty years since Stanley Kubrick set the standard for the look and feel of space travel in 2001: A Space Odyssey. In 1977, George Lucas defined the universe as one giant, albeit glamorous, battlefield in Star Wars. Two years later James Cameron showed us what utter horror awaited the unwary intergalactic traveler in Alien. Since then, most space epics have been variations on the themes of these three great movies. It's almost as though the earlier films created some sort of history that every thing since must be based on. Supernova is a stew made from parts of all the above movies, and the results are not very appetizing.
A medical emergency space craft is traveling for unknown reasons in what appears to be the wrong side of the tracks, galactically speaking. The small crew is about equally divided between men and women, but since they can't get within ten feet of each other without the idea of sex entering the picture, mankind does not appear to have evolved much. Soon comes the mysterious distress signal, a mandatory element of this type of movie. It turns out to be from a man stranded on a defunct mining colony. He is Karl Larson [Peter Facinelli], the very same man chief medical officer Karla Evers [Angela Basset] had an unhappy affair with years ago. [Gee, it's a small universe!] When he arrives, however, the crew discovers he may or may not be the same man because he is twenty or so years younger. He has smuggled aboard the prerequisite Thing From Another World, this glowing, translucent object, which looks suspiciously like a giant lava lamp. It doesn't take long for crew members to start disappearing right on cue, just as we expect them to. After an hour and a half, the movie ends with more of a whimper than a bang.
There are some good CGI effects in Supernova. The jump to light speed is especially impressive. I also liked the way the space craft creaked and gently rocked just like a ship at sea. The ship's computer, which has developed some its [her?] own emotions, is amusing.
I'm afraid, however, that this is a case of the bad way outweighing the good. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, you had an extraordinary vision. Alien and Star Wars did not, but they had whopping good stories to tell. Supernova has very little to tell, and all of that has been told much better a dozen times before. There are so many plot holes that the movie almost becomes its own black hole drama-wise. There is no attempt at character development. That computer has by far the best personality. The entire cast is wasted, which renders comments on their performances useless. For instance, the only thing of note about James Spader is that he has worked out a whole lot since his last film. Now approaching middle age, he has decided it's time to become totally buff. I call this the Nicholas Cage Syndrome.",1016409600,3,3021,4.5962962962962965
1090411,1,6305922640,"This movie was bad. Very bad.
It's nothing but a contrived, silly plot made up to wrap around lots of T&A, so that it looks as though it's about more then just an excuse to show lots of T&A.
It plays like a _bad_ late-night Showtime flick, if you catch my drift.
The formula has been done many, many, many times before, and so much better (check out _Alien_, perhaps THE best sci-fi deep-space-alien-terror movie ever made. Or to a lesser extent _Sphere_ or _Event Horizon_).
I got this for $...out of Wal-Mart's clearence bin, and I regret every penny. I DO NOT reccomend this movie to anyone.",1012003200,4,594,4.5092592592592595
1090412,2,6305922640,"Probably ""Supernova"" will be remembered in the history of movies as the first film which credits its director as ""Thomas Lee,"" formerly ""Alan Smithee,"" pseudonynm used when its directo(s) do not want to put their names on the product.  And someone's decision to use this name will be quite understandable if you watch this badly constructed film.  (But I watched twice, really.  It attracts some people in a strange way, like a badly edited old film on midnight TV.)

The story is about a medical rescue ship in outer space, which gets an emergency call from a survivor (so he claims).  Of course, the survivor gets on board, and causes more troubles among the crew. Now I don't complain about the familiar plot; ""Alien"" comes to our mind first, but that Ridley Scott film too had several forerunners (How about ""Forbidden Planet""?)  The real problem is, some (or many, you say) scenes have no function in the story.

In other words, you can extract a certain scene (for example, two of the ship crew hugging naked each other or one character playing chess with the computer) and put it into somewhere else in the movie.  Usually you cannot do it because such change destroys the smooth development of the story.  In ""Supernova,"" however, nothing changes.  This means no drift of the story is created to push the whole movie ahead.  Consequently we see many so-so action scenes, but we see no horror, no suspense, no thrill or even no laugh generated during the course.

Well, I know about its troubled production history and the result of the film clearly betrays the tinkering of the people involved.  You will be entertained with the pretty impressive CGI and may also notice the traces of editing or re-editing in the cutting room, which may be interesting to some fans.

For instance, it is implied that James Spaders's character had experienced a certain kind of drug in his past, but this fact disappears suddenly as the film goes on; the spaceship's computer seems confused because at one scene it (she?) does one horrible thing while at another it stubbornly refuses to do that; or we see a rather ambiguous ending of the film, which seems quite pointless after all.  These inconsistency does not help us to keep interested in the film. I really want to know -- What WAS the original script?  Or was there anything bad like that from the first?

As the use of ""Alan Smithee"" (in this case ""Thomas Lee"") strictly requires the director(s) not to speak ill of the film they made publicly, we will not hear the inside story of the film, or their feelings about the product from Mr. Hill, Sholder or Coppola.  But I believe you can guess the truths and your guess is probably right.",1010275200,11,2686,4.690831556503198
1090413,5,6305922640,"Very sharp sets, cool lighting, and interesting characters re-tell a suspenseful 'alien' tale; except that the intruder is a mutated trojan horse with a time bomb created by ETs (and script writers) who know something about Quantum Collapse and 9-dimensional matter. (Current super-string theory holds that present day matter {3 dimension plus time} is the result of a universal collapse of an earlier 9 dimensional {plus time} reality. See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Introduction-to-Superstrings-and-M-Theory-Graduate-Texts-in-Contemporary-Physics/dp/0387985891/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Introduction to Superstrings and M-Theory (Graduate Texts in Contemporary Physics)</a>

The idea that advanced aliens would lay booby-traps for unsuspecting, potential competitors, and that the bait would be pretty crystals and super human strength is VERY original; not to mention that the results of unleashing such matter WOULD, in fact, cause a light-speed tidal wave that completely annihilated everything in it's path by recreating matter with 9 dimensional characteristics.

If that's not interesting enough, then enjoy the chess playing computer, Angela Bassett, Lou Diamond Phillips, or the really cool shots of space around a blue giant.

Remember: If you only saw the VHS version, you haven't seen the movie. The restored scenes on the DVD make the movie, and I can only guess that they must have been deleted by someone who thought they were too cerebral.

1090444,1,6305922640,"The perplexing question on every screenwriter's mind concerns what it takes to get their script made into a major film. If they've had the pleasure (if one dares to consider it such) of watching ""Supernova,"" they will find their answer. Treading on familiar ground in the sci-fi genre, the film is a glossy yet undetermined and ultimately tedious experience, one that registers little intensity or plot involvement.
It's story is a spiced-up version of any sci-fi film you've ever seen, only duller. It begins with an obligatory catastrophe in which a call for help sends the medical ship Nightingale into a hyper-space dimension jump. As if the procedure itself were not hokey enough, the crew of the ship must strip completely naked before the jump. When they reach their intended target, they find that they are dangerously low on resources and their captain has perished.
Things get even more harried for the film once Troy, the lone survivor of a mining expedition, boards the ship. Troy bears a resemblance to someone from Dr. Evers' past, and she, along with now-captain Nick Vanzant, has reservations about keeping him aboard. Even more perplexing is the artifact he has in tow, a mysterious, crystalline structure that glows and, apparently, makes people stronger and younger when touched.
""Supernova"" has one main problem that causes many others: it wants to be fresh. Let's forget, for a moment, that we're in a copycat's nightmare, from such scenes as the hyper-jump, a direct link to that of ""Star Wars"" minus the nudity, or that instead of a nicely-paced original movie, what we are left with is a recycling of the once-reliable race-against-time story. What it boils down to in the end is that attempts at trying revitalize old tactics are successful at times, but must have a certain degree of interest to generate; this film has none.
It's an actor's worst nightmare, to say the least, though the cheesy lines and insipid action are handled with an earnestness that should earn each cast member an Oscar for Tolerance of Insolence. James Spader is witty and stern, a perfect compliment to Angela Bassett's identical attributes; not only that, but the two actually have some chemistry, if offbeat. The rest of the cast goes along with the story, though without much conviction or enthusiasm. The computer is the best character, the only one, aside from Spader and Bassett, who develops any real emotion.
It may surprise some that ""Supernova"" has two unaccredited directors to its name: Walter Hill, and Francis Ford Coppola, who disowned the film. Can you blame them? What's going on in this mish-mash is anyone's guess, and by the film's drawn-out conclusion, you'll find yourself wondering who makes the final decisions about which films are worth production.",1003449600,5,2777,5.026030368763558

Production design is top-notch as are the special effects. The DVD version also includes deleted scenes, which upon viewing, I have to admit I was actually glad they were deleted. There were several deleted scenes with printed words on the bottom of the screen telling you where the location was. The appearance of these words in the film would have been jarring had they made it into the final product, taking you out of the movie for a few seconds. The movie did a nice job conveying each location without location titles if you were paying attention. It was also interesting to hear the much sexier-sounding computer's voice they were going to use, but I'm glad they didn't and toned it down. I would have liked to see another cut of the film integrating the deleted scenes just to see it all in context, but I think the movie would have been less good with the deleted scenes included. Although I will say that the edited movie, at 91 minutes, is much too short. I could have easily watched another 30 to 60 minutes (of the non-deleted quality stuff). I suppose you can chalk it up to Hollywood economics. It was a relief to see a movie depict a trans-dimensional jump in a slightly different way. I liked the brief moment of complete silence midway through the jump. In the deleted scenes, the silence was not there, and it was not as effective without that silence. The plot was good, but I thought it focused a bit too heavily on the sex aspect.
 The actors are all first-rate, with James Spader especially giving a stunning performance as a cold and efficient captain with more underneath. I haven't seen Spader in several years, and I almost didn't recognize him. I would have loved to see more of the humorous verbal sparring between him and the computer.

1090625,2,6305922640,"I give this movie 2 stars only because it's fun to watch.  Otherwise, it's a lame attempt at sci-fi action. ""And now, another pointless scene of explicit nudity"" seems to be the best caption for this movie.
The only good things to this movie's name are the special effects, which are among the best I've seen, and Angela Bassett, whose performance is the only hint of acting talent in the film, despite having a usually great performing cast.
The ending made little, if any, sense and left you wondering ""so...what happens to Earth?""
Final verdict:  Ok, if absolutely desperate to see a movie.",972086400,2,593,4.747572815533981
1090626,1,6305922640,"Sadly, the only reason I watched this movie was because James Spader starred in it.  I've always liked the characters he's portrayed.  In the past, he's played villain after villain.  But, recently (Stargate, The Watcher) as in this case, he's played the strong-willed hero .  Despite an A-list cast (Spader, Angela Bassett, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robert Forster & Robin Tunney, this movie goes nowhere fast.  Since it's a sci-fi picture, it has your typical special effects-laden scenes.  But as everyone knows; special effects + no plot = bad movie.  (The convoluted plot centers around an energy source that has the potential to destroy and re-build the universe.  Think: Genesis project from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.)  The only bright spot has to be Peter Faccinelli's over-the-top performance as the film's villain.  (He reminds me of a young Tom Cruise, both in his look and in his speaking manner.)
Unless you have money to burn, don't waste your time buying or watching this movie.  Better recent films in this genre include: Event Horizon and Pitch Black.",971740800,,1071,4.994350282485875
1090627,1,6305922640,"This film has an interesting history.  Principal photography was completed  under director Walter Hill, but he left the project due to creative  differences with a few of his bosses at MGM.  Two other directors, one of  them the once-great Francis Ford Coppola, were then asked to reshoot some  scenes and edit it all into a comprehensible film.  Screen credit for  directing this mess is given to Thomas Lee, which is the new pseudonym the  DGA is using for instances where the director doesn't want his name stamped  on the awful film he helped create (Alan Smithee rest in peace).  That  story I just told was more interesting and entertaining than Supernova  itself.  It is a boring, vague film that develops subplots but never  finishes them, showcases some genuinely good special effects that would  have been much more at home in a better movie, and wastes the talents of  some decent actors (Bassett, Spader, and Diamond Phillips really deserve  better).  Parts of it are kind of like a space porno movie where people  have sex five minutes after meeting for the first time.  Also, for those of  you expecting it to be some kind of a disaster movie about a supernova, you  will be disappointed; this is more of a murder-in-space story, like Alien  except without the alien and everything else that made Alien great.  And  then there's the ending, which is more like just a random place where they  decided to stop telling the story than an ending.  This movie seriously is  so bad you can't even make fun of it.  Crow and Tom Servo would be rendered  speechless.  Seriously, unless you really like James Spader or really want  to see Robin Tunney's breasts (she was the girl in End of Days and plays  another thick-skulled bimbo here), my advice is to stay the hell away.",969235200,15,1779,4.705882352941177

I highly recommend this movie on DVD, the sound is incredible and  the deleted scenes/alternate ending are worth checking out. Initially, when  renting this movie, I remembered seeing James Spader in the trailer when  the movie originally opened. I was hesitant to walk out the store with it  (based on my opinion of most of his prevous movies), but took the  risk...and couldn't be happier with myself for not passing this one up!",968112000,,514,4.850574712643678

It's all been done before in one form or another, crippled ship in distant part of the Galaxy picks up  lone survivor who is not what he seems. The acting is ok from all quarters  and the visual/audio special effects are above average. However, mid-way  through the film its quite apparent there isn't anywhere for it to go and  the ending is very predictable on the whole.

1090721,3,6305922640,"Before I insult this film, I must say that the special effects and sound are terrific. Now here's the bad news. SUPERNOVA suffers from lack of good  action sequences and an exiting plot, two things that are important in a  sci-fi film; so it's not nearly as good as other recent sci-fi movies. How  interesting does this plot sound: Some wierd guy starts killing people and  throwing people off the ship after having sex with them. That's pretty much  all that happens except for a couple sub-plots. But if you can't find  anything better to watch, this is your film.",967680000,2,567,4.62
1090722,2,6305922640,"The trailer for this movie had me really excited.  Too bad it didn't live up to its promise.  First of all this movie goes by really quick.  It is  only about 1-1/2 hours.  To me that is not long enough to set up &  complete a really good sci-fi story.  Anyway.  Supernova starts out really  slow.  This movie takes place on the a medical vessel (Nightingale).  They  receive a distress call comes from another dimension or somewhere.  So they  make a dimension jump in which the captain dies (a horrible nasty death).  The remaining crew members include James Spader, Angela Bassett, Lou  Diamond Philips & Robin Tunney.  At this point you'd think it could  still be a good movie.  Don't be fooled.  They go to the planet and  intercept the shuttle leaving the planet from which the distress call  originated.  They bring him aboard & of course he is some good looking  hunk which Robin Tunney can't take her eyes off of.
Spader orders that  the shuttle be searched and Philips discovers a strange object which  mesmerizes him.  They confront the ""Troy"" with their discovery  & he confesses that he is a treasure hunter & this is his booty.  Spader orders that it be jetisoned formt he ship as soon as they are far  away from the planet.  Why wait?  I don'y know.  Then Spader goes down to  the planet to look for fuel.  Of course there is none & Troy sends the  shuttle out into space leaving Spader trapped on the planet.  Oh did I  forge to mention the gratuitous sex scene between Troy & Robin Tunney?  Who happens to be Philips girlfriend? Well now the killing begins.  First  Tunney, then Philips, then another crew member.  From then on it just gets  lame.  Basically Spader & Bassett survive & Troy is eventually  killed.
This movie was really sad.
I give the movie a one & the DVD  a three.  The DVD does sport some extras.  Like about 30 minutes of extra  footage.  Which they might as well have left in the movie.  Nothing  monumental or anything - but it would have added a little more to the  story.  Also has an alternative ending - which is pretty much the same as  the other one.
Don't waste your money buying this DVD.  Please rent it.",967420800,14,2153,4.44935064935065
1090723,2,6305922640,"James Spader really hit the weight room and protein powder for his role in Supernova.  You have to hand it to him:  He gives his all to even the most mediocre movies.
Supernova offers us a familiar story. Intergalactic  cruiser receives mysterious distress call from a distant mining  colony...should they investigate, or not? Naturally, this is always a  no-brainer:  Should they not investigate, there would be no movie.
They  investigate... Naturally, they all come to realize  that they should not have answered the distress call.  Improbable, and  gratuitous relationships are pointedly developed at the expense of original  plot or characters.  Movie is so muddled and poorly developed, it's no  surprise that Walter Hill took his name off it (he goes by his ""nom de  dreadful-movie"", Thomas Lee).",967075200,2,803,5.2204724409448815

More SFX than event,  contact, etc great sound, acting WAS good, Spader was great.  Change your  mind set and relax, If you liked event with its stupid horror this was as  good with better SFX.

1090726,4,6305922640,"Seeing the R-Rated DVD version of SUPERNOVA magnifies the creative differences between the Motion Picture corporate mindset and the creative  control of the Director.  How?  The DVD contains a little more non-frontal  nudity and about twenty minutes of deleted scenes which if incorporated  into the original theatrical release would have resulted in a totally  difference film.  The alternate ending conjures up memories of THE DAY THE  EARTH CAUGHT FIRE and answers the question, where's the Supernova.  The  deleted scenes make this movie more complex by actually making key elements  of the plot more visible.  Synopsis: The medical rescue ship NIGHTINGALE  ""light-Jumps"" to answer the distress calls of a mining planet.  Upon arrival, they find the mining planet threatened by a ""Blue  Giant"" (a sun going supernova).  The ship is damaged coming out of the  ""jump"" and now the rescuers' survival is threatened unless they  can repair their ship and re-jump before the blue giant explodes. The  reason for the distress call is a mystery to the crew until, one survivor  is brought aboard carrying an alien artifact of unknown purpose and power.  What follows can easily be called a non-threatening copy of ALIEN.  BUT,  then we view the deleted scenes (unfortunately grouped separately under  DELETED SCENES) and the ""copy"" takes on new properties with  questions answered, scenes extended to a point where they actually make  sense, and what sounds to be a difference soundtrack with a little more  HEAVY METAL (movie) influence.  What Happened to this film?  It could  have been a classic if left uncut.  Even the deleted scenes suggest  additional film sequences were abandoned and/or not included on this DVD.  I viewed this movie in standard format before watching it in widescreen  (both offered on this DVD) and you are not missing much.  However,  hometheater sound at ""rock your world level"" is highy  recommended.  This is a movie worth watching again, even if its just to  mentally place those deleted scenes within the running movie.",966902400,58,2049,5.149847094801223

Also where is the Supernova?Supernova was so bad I fell asleep watching it on the big  screen! if you like cheesy sci-fi then buy this movie. Also why the different  rating on DVD?The people in this movie have been better movies than this  crap! Robert Forster was great in ""The Black Hole""(also on DVD  here at Amazon !) James Spader was OK in ""Stargate"" and the rest  of the should of did a different movie altogether! Supernova is more abou  the EMT crew on a spaceship in outer space. They find a madman,The madman  kill everyone aboard (leaving Spader and some else!) This movie has lots of  Violence for it's rating(maybe that why the DVD is rated R?) and nudity  like James Spaders butt. I know there other examples of the nudity/violence  that would given this bomb from MGM a R rating!
Also who in Hollywood  green lights these chessy Sci-fi movies?I've seen/read bette ""Doctor  Who"" books/videos than this crude! Whoever green lights this stuff must  be very rich to see a lot of money for just special effects and no story(or  in this case lack of story) For better sci-fi watch  ""ID4"".""Stargate"",""Total Recall"",""Escape  from New York/LA"",""Armaggedon"", and  the""Star  Wars""Trilogy, the list is endless! i gave a few examples of some of my  favorite sci-fi movies for starters! So if you want to see this be  forewarned it's a real stinker,bomb, flop or whatever really bad movies are  called nowadays!
