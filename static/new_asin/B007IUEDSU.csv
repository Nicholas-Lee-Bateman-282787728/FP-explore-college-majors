Just about every line was forced out in this stunting, sputtering, very annoying delivery like the actors were partially lobotomized. The pace of the movie doesn't help either. Its like they had 10 minutes of material and needed to make a hr+ length movie. Obviously, the directing and script writing had a lot to do with how awful this movie is but  I'm a bit undecided about the acting. One one hand, the characters were believable but the movie is such a stinker its hard not to blame it on the actors... Until it comes out free somewhere, do NOT pay to watch this movie.",1509494400,,678,4.512195121951219
