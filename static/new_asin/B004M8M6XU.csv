8435657,2,B004M8M6XU,"This was written and edited and directed by people with excellent material, who had zero real knowledge of the war or the battles, and minimal English language skills.

The sequences are original, properly repaired and presented. But some are mislabeled (I know of two incidents in the first disk alone... I have not viewed the other 10 yet). Some inserted sounds are terrible (aircraft engine sounds are turbines... the engines shown are piston driven propeller bombers). As an old aviator, that simply jarred me to the fraud of the editing.

Words, places and names of primary players are mis-pronounced. The narrator read his script... written by someone who has read a book or two, not someone really knowledgeable.  The narrator clearly was not privy to the war or its players, and the editor did not catch his errors.  It is not a simple error... it is one after another,  The Narrator speaks English pretty well, but when he does not have a clue about a word, he simply runs over it as well as his multi-lingual skills allow.

There is good material here, if  you want to search for it. If you are just studying the war and have no background, it is a good start.  If you are knowledgeable, go see the ""Color of War"" or something like it.",1412380800,,1245,4.627272727272727

8435659,4,B004M8M6XU,"The Dvd set contains 68 documentaries from World War II. Some are better vthan others but they do not seem to be in order historically on the Dvd's, they just seem to be placed on any random dvd as they were made. I think the documentaries are great. I am not the worlds greatest WW II historian, but I thought they were very good on content. The biggest problem with this series is the narration plain, and simple it was horrid! I do not think the narrator was very proffesional, as possibly he was just plucked of the street at the last minute. He mis-pronounced words as well as names and made such obvious errors in reading the script such as "" The Germans had surrendered (should of been surrounded)Ploesti with smoke machines to help conceal the plant"". And overstated figures such as ""The Germans had captured nearly 12 Million Russian tanks at Smolensk"". I know that he was just reading the dialog, but any kind of professional narrator (Say like Burt Lancaster) would of stopped, and asked if the figures, or spelling was correct. The best is at the end of the battle of Berlin when they ask what happened to Hitlers body after the Russians took the bunker. It shows the picture of Hitlers driver/butler lying on the ground with a bullet hole through his forehead (and ofcourse his darned socks) and the narrator bluntly states that to be Hitler's body found by the Russians with several of the soldiers being photgraphed with it before it was flow of to the Kremlin for an autopsy. All, and all I loved the set, as I am an army veteran who served in Europe in the 80's, and loved the military and war tourist sites to visit, and like to see the places I have visited on the documentaries, such as Dachau, and the site of the Nurenburg rallies. (I went to Monsters of Rock in 1987 there)I cannot get enough of WW II documentaries. If they are out there I have them or will have them eventually. But again apart from the narration (which actually is kind of amusing other than the fact that parts of the dvd's have nothing amusing about them)I would highly recommend this set to any WW II buffs out there. You cannot beat the price, as I got mine very much below the recommended price here on Amazon. I hope you buy this set, as I think it is well worth the cost. But please do not go by my review, as I am just your average schmuck who is enticed by any WW II documentaries. But next time you make a documentary my fine friends who made this one, Hire a better Narrator. Sorry I do not think Mr. Lancaster is availiable.

8435660,3,B004M8M6XU,This set of vintage war newsreels  and cheaply made documentaries may not be for everybody but you get a staggering 50 hours of informative footage for a little over 20 bucks. My strongest critique is the editing  of the film  footage  from b&w into a sepia color tone. Great gift idea........,1303776000,3,293,4.686274509803922
