4885675,1,B005SIMH1O,"I hardly know where to start: The picture quality is quite terrible, possibly the worst I have ever seen on a classical Blu-ray disc (although the equally terrible Tchaikovsky symphony set by Gergiev runs it close). multi-coloured lights on all sides distort everything as if one was in a pop concert. (Perhaps that was the idea but it is NOT what I was looking for!)The performers hair seem almost frosted and the instruments flash as if coated in minute diamonds! Skin at times flashes as if it was snake skin! Focus is extremely soft and at times almost deliberately out of focus and colour balance is very blue/pink. It has an extreme digital look that is very tiring on the eyes. The sound is only stereo, which for a work like Carmina Burana is simply inadequate to convey the power of this work. I thought my equipment must be at fault so tried the disc on another player and Sony TV but with the same effect. The orchestral playing and singing is fine as far as it goes but a Blu-ray performance of Carmina should be a total production and this is most certainly not that. It is sold at full price and would be bad value at a discount. I could hardly watch it through to the end before writing this review. How it ever got past basic quality approval is a mystery as EuroArts are usually very good, but they have completely lost the plot here. My advice is save your money.",1392336000,4,1381,4.440944881889764
4885676,3,B005SIMH1O,"This is a review of [Carmina Burana [Blu-ray] (2013)]

As far as I know, this offering is for the one and only Carmina Burana performance available in Blu-ray format, and I pre-ordered from Amazon so as to receive it on the release date (today).  Amazon did not disappoint -- my copy was delivered on-time early this morning!

I immediately scanned the disc, was very disappointed with the video quality in many of the scenes, quit watching in disgust and submitted a very negative review.  I (unrealistically) expected nearly perfect video, audio, and performance.

Sadly, my initial review was given in haste, and I must sincerely apologize for expressing judgement based only on a quick look.  After playing the entire disc, I saw that video quality was variable (but not uniformly poor), apparently substantially dependent upon individual cameras.  For example, wide views from the back of the auditorium are never sharp and lack good color (garish lighting for the concert doesn't help).  The camera applied principally to follow conductor Rattle was intermediate in quality, being adequate but certainly not high definition. On the other hand, many closeup views of members of the orchestra, their instruments, the soloists, and members of the chorus are beautiful in composition and detail.  This substantially compensates for the weaker moments.

I was wrong in writing that the Blu-ray video quality was no better than that of the corresponding DVD release with the same title -- actually more than half of the Blu-ray video is high definition quality.  When this concert was recorded in 2004, camera and recording technology was much less capable than that available today.  Instead of 'flaming' EuroArts and Naxos, I should have been commending them for bringing us what is probably the best available recording of that concert. My earlier admonition to buy the less expensive DVD instead of the Blu-ray version must be tempered by these facts.

Unfortunately, audio quality is also less than spectacular.  To me, the sound field seems muddled and spatially inconsistent.  At times, important instruments are difficult to hear.  Though I don't know why, the dynamic range from quietest to loudest passages is much less than it should be (though it is unclear whether this is due to the performance, the recording or the mastering).

If you think I'm being picky about video and audio quality, I invite you to experience ""Mahler: Symphony 2 [Blu-ray] (2011)-- Chailly"" available from Amazon.  Technically, that performance is very nearly perfect, with the sharpest video imagery, exquisite full dynamic range sound, and superb performances by all (though aesthetically, too much emphasis is given to Conductor Chailly).  I was hoping for something like the Mahler for Carmina Burana.

Then we have the performance itself.  ""O Fortuna"" leads with great promise, but soon the performance moderates, lacking the energy required by the composition.  While the musicians are excellent and Sir Rattle's directing is wonderful to watch, somehow the music is perfectly played yet uninspired.  For a musical comparison, I'd suggest the excellent Atlanta Symphony's 1990 performance on Telarc, also available from Amazon.

All in all, this Carmina Burana release is a good disc; I'm glad I bought it and regret having unfairly condemned it initially.",1390867200,8,3350,5.265536723163842
4885677,5,B005SIMH1O,"I have the Seiji Ozawa version from Japan with European soloists, which is coupled with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which is a plus, but I liked the enthusiasm that Simon Rattle brings to the Berlin Philharmonic on this DVD along with excellent soloists.",1368057600,2,254,5.071428571428571
4885678,5,B005SIMH1O,"First, the sonics. It does seem a bit undernourished in terms of dynamic range, but if you do what I did, and jack up the volume, (about 5db over normal, in this case and using dts) you won't be too disappointed. I have the old Ozawa version in a presumably chinese pressing, which I got on e-bay. Its sonics are pretty grim on my copy, and the picture is lousy. But Kathleen Battle is marvellous. I've never been a big Ozawa fan - I just never thought  he had anything new to say. I have a few other later Simon Rattle/BPO dvds, and most don't have any sonic deficiencies.

The visuals are well done, with everybody getting a chance in the spotlight. Picture quality is good, if not up to the very latest standards(this is a 2004 recording).

As to Carmina Burana, it's a good rollicking piece - one great tune after another for an hour or so, orchestration very unsophisticated and brash, lots of percussion, and a whole lot of fun! The choirs are uniformly good, as are the soloists, but I give special kudos to baritone Christian Gerhaher, who really interprets his various solos. Great vocal gymnastics and facial expressions (and excellent falsetto!). Rattle handles the piece at a consistent level of excitement, and his is a performance that will stand up to the original Eugen Jochum recording from 1967.

The Leonora overture is well done, and the overblown version of the Handel Messiah chorus is OK for what it is.

I am finding with more and more of these releases, where reviews are luke-warm or worse, sound issues are generally improved by using proper surround sound decoding. I like dts over dolby digital. Even though my receiver will generate five channels out of the PCM stereo track, it always seems flatter and less involving than the dts track.

Overall, this is a disc worth getting, whether you're an existing Orff fan, or not.",1290470400,13,1853,4.668711656441718
4885679,5,B005SIMH1O,"The performance is really charged, and the soloists are brilliant. When the children are ushered in to partake in the singing, it elicits are really cool vibe. To see their facial expressions, as they realize what they're participating in lends an amusing emotional charge to the performance. The comments pertaining to audio compression are pertinent, but when you get caught up in the energy and interaction of the musicians, and Rattle's communication with them, the audio issue takes a back seat. Lots of uplifting attributes are conveyed, and the performance shines. It's quite brilliant, and quite honestly, the audio is completely tolerable. Just kick back and ENJOY the show.",1290038400,6,683,5.275229357798165
4885680,2,B005SIMH1O,"We already have an excellent performance of the Carmina Burana on DVD: Seiji Ozawa's 1989 New Year's concert with the BPO and a stellar cast of soloists, together with a fairly smashing Beethoven 9, recorded 2001 in Japan, both in fine sound and fair video. Sir Simon Rattle's new version documents a 2004 New Year's concert at the Berlin Philharmonie and is coupled with Beethoven's Leonore III overture and -- a very British Proms encore -- Hndel's Halleluja Chorus from ""Messiah"" in Sir Eugene Goossens' bombastic beef-up which throws in everything ""but the kitchen sink"". In Rattle's understatement: this is ""a little bit over the top"". As ever, the BPO musicians play exceedingly well and Leonore comes off fine, though with nary an individual touch. Sir Simon usually is at his best in the flashy, extraverted repertoire and the ""Carmina"" start out with an exciting ""O Fortuna"". From here on the performance flattens. Despite Rattle's (not always attractive) ecstatic facial and body language, this is a snappy, energetic, but ultimately low-profile reading of Orff's highly dramatic, sensual and evocative score. The soloists and choirs are very good and so is the video, given the ghastly colored floodlights. But the audio (all three tracks) is indeed compressed, as TBS observes. You may try cranking up your (pre)amp's volume. I fared a bit better when I used my (Denon AH-D500) headphones, but nothing will really compensate for the limited dynamic range. This raises the question why EuroArts (who have also done this to other issues) and other companies stupidly sabotage their own productions. Do they really think we listen to DVDs on a Victrola?",1288742400,17,1662,5.113970588235294
4885681,3,B005SIMH1O,"A fine performance all around, but unfortunately spoiled by audio compression. The dynamic range of this recording is less than 30DB. What a shame!",1288224000,12,147,5.166666666666667
8485173,4,B005SIMH1O,"This review is of a download from Amazon Prime and not the DVDs. Here, you get to see what the fuss is all about for Sir Simon Rattle. I swear, at some points he conducted just by moving his eyebrows! A massive performance of Carmina Burana, bookended with a little Beethoven and Handel's Hallelujah Chorus. Sir Simon Rattle also addresses the crowd (first in German and then gives up and finishes in English.) I've seen a lot of these classical concerts on Amazon Prime and this is the first time I've seen a conductor talk to the crowd. A rich, joyous and vigorous concert, where the percussionists work as hard as the string section. I did experience some extreme fluctuations in sound which is why this is getting 4 stars and not 5.",1511481600,,736,4.541353383458647

8485175,4,B005SIMH1O,"Others have mentioned the issue of this DVD's sound, so I won't add to that other than to say it's really shame this wasn't produced in surround sound - it would definitely make what I think is a close-to-monumental performance a full-fledged 5-star event.  I just wish I'd have been in the audience for this one.  Carmina Burana was one of the first LPs I ordered as a teen who had recently discovered classical music when I joined the Columbia Record Club - a well-regarded recording (in Mono) by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy, which I pretty-much wore out from playing it over and over for several years.  This is a better recording, even in old-fashioned stereo - after all, it's over 14 years old and things have really changed for the better with new technology.  But this is definitely a DVD I'll hang onto.  The performance is quite exciting - the Berlin Philharmonic is simply an amazing group, and Simon Rattle is terrific, as are the soloists, chorus and boy's chorus.  I may still shop for a more recent recording, but even if I never find one in surround sound of similar quality (which is highly likely), I'll still enjoy watching this  very exciting production.",1484352000,2,1194,4.739130434782608
8485176,5,B005SIMH1O,Carmina Burana is a spectacular piece of music and this production is musically fantastic. a young Gerhaher sings beautifully and one song requires him to sing from a tenor to a deep baritone in the course of three minutes. Quite amazing. jef,1468713600,,242,4.785714285714286

8485181,3,B005SIMH1O,"Sir Simon Rattle and the Berliner Philharmoniker give outstanding performances in this recording from the final day of 2004, recently released on Blu-ray.  The concert begins with Beethovens Leonore Overture No. 3, which is given a straightforward orchestral treatment, without too much bombast.  The final piece, Handels Hallelujah Chorus (in an arrangement by Sir Eugene Goossens), is presented to the audience with a brief explanatory narrative by the conductor as to why this piece was chosen to follow the evenings headlining work.  Sir Simon wittily moves from German to English (classical music fans should get the joke when they hear it).

The Beethoven and Handel pieces bookend Carl Orffs secular cantata, Carmina Burana.  The Rundfunkchor Berlin gives a powerful vocal performance, and soloists Sally Matthews, Lawrence Brownlee, and Christian Gerhaher cannot be faulted.  Dramatic lighting changes are made in the concert hall between some movements of the Carmina, perhaps for dramatic effect.  The colors in the lighting are unobtrusive during this piece, but the blue tints are especially harsh and distracting during the performances of the Leonore and Hallelujah.  Sadly, the only audio option available on the Blu-ray is 2.0 PCM Stereo.  Also, small white pixels appear every once in a while (rather infrequently, but enough to make me take notice).  In other words, the video doesnt do much justice for the terrific performance.",1392940800,,1447,5.419642857142857
8485182,4,B005SIMH1O,"Not sure you've heard Carl Orff's ""Carmina Burana""? Oh, yes, you have. A short movement from it, ""O Fortuna,"" has been appropriated so often by film and TV to convey ominousness that there's no way you could have missed it. As exciting as that bit is -- it opens and closes the cantata -- there is so much more to this work, which music scholar David Mason Greene calls ""perhaps the only piece of `serious' new music to have won truly popular acclaim since World War II."" (It premiered in 1937.)

As the Blu-ray booklet aptly notes: ""The power that lies behind the music of Carmina Burana is primitive: insistent rhythms, ostinato repetitions, and a complete avoidance of chromatic or atonal musical idioms make the work compelling, unforgettable and physically gratifying in its simple energy and strength.""

Personally, I find the work's lyrical, nonbombastic sections even more appealing. And they're done full justice here by three soloists who could not be bettered (soprano Sally Matthews, baritone Christian Gerhaher and tenor Lawrence Brownlee), the Berlin Philharmonic (augmented), and two formidable choirs. Conductor Simon Rattle does a stellar job of making sure these huge forces come together so the work can register powerfully with the audience.

This concert is bookended by Beethoven's ""Leonore No. 3"" overture and Handel's ""Hallelujah"" chorus (as orchestrated to the max by Eugene Goossens). They're enjoyable, but I doubt anyone is picking this disc up for those pieces.

A couple of other reviewers were severely disappointed in the picture quality of this Blu-ray. It's true that the recording -- from more than nine years ago -- does not come close to the high definition resolution we've come to enjoy. The middle and long shots are softer and grainier, there is aliasing (a jaggedness to some edges), and the color seems tilted to the yellow side of the spectrum. Whatever its shortcomings, this disc remains in large part a couple of notches above standard DVD quality, and there's actually a good amount of detail in the close-ups (you'll have no trouble spotting the singers' fillings).

I wish the audio were 5.1 for full surround-sound effect. It's odd that this was provided on the DVD but not on the Blu-ray. Some other reviewers of the DVD complained about the sound, and if the 5.1 mix was at fault, perhaps that accounts for its removal. I have to say that the sole option here, PCM stereo, sounded fine to me, and I never felt the audio lacked power, range or texture. I had to crank up my receiver a bit more than usual, but that's all.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I was provided with a review copy of this particular disc, although I've purchased many EuroArts discs (as well as those of other classical music labels) over the years.",1392422400,,2809,5.027956989247312
