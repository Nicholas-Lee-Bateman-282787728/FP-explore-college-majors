8396497,5,B003GOOYOA,The item came sooner than expected and was great,1409270400,,48,4.444444444444445
8396498,3,B003GOOYOA,"I purchased it mainly for the Jack Benny sequence, and was disappointed for two reasons:  Very poor film quality, and it's an excerpt from the full-lenght film, MEDICINE MAN,, which I have--with  a very good story line, with both humor and drama, and with solid acting by Benny along with a fine  supporting cast....I thought this was one of the short, one-reelers of the period, not an excerpt......The Ritz Bros. segment is a complete short film and is OK....I haven't watched the others, yet....",1406332800,,498,4.904761904761905
8396499,3,B003GOOYOA,"I didn't realize the Jack Benny film was quite as short as it turned out to be. I think there may have been some missing parts, but even so, it was fun to see him look like he was even less than 39 years old!

The other shorts were interesting. The Ritz Brothers are amusing - very physical, even more so than the Marx Brothers. And I'm surprised Pinky Lee didn't become even more popular than he did!

Fascinating that somehow most of these were call ""educational!"" The only one that approached that classification was ""The Memory Lingers On.""

All rather corny, but a nice view of a different time!",1382054400,,600,4.4363636363636365
8396500,4,B003GOOYOA,yup... i love the movie but i Love the Ritz Brothers... i think they are the greatest... they really make me laugh...so it dosen't matter what movie they are in the movie will always be good to me...,1357516800,,199,4.2631578947368425
8396501,3,B003GOOYOA,"This collection features some bizarre comedy shorts, mostly from Educational Pictures (these are not school films).  For those who don't know, Educational Pictures intended to make educational films for schools, but without success there they ventured into making very low budget theatrical comedy shorts.
It you are looking for true classic comedies, look elsewhere.
These are of interest more for their rare unusual situations than their quality of comedy.  Mercifully all but ""Hotel Anchovy"" are only 10 minutes long or less, keeping them as novelties.
This also includes a short called ""The Memory Lingers On"" which features silent newsreel clips from WWI on.  This could be the most worthwhile film in this collection.

1930 ""What Ho, Romeo"" is a bland Jack Benny short. Not really a short at all, this is a 9 minute Home Movie excerpt from the bland Public Domain (widely available) 66 minute feature ""The Medicine Man"". And when you watch it, you will notice that something is missing.  Scenes seem to lead up to something that is not there.
1937 ""Dental Follies"" features Pinky Lee as a dentist who uses live night club act rejects to distract his patients from the dental drill. These acts belong on the Gong Show. (10 minutes)
1934 ""Rhythm In A Night Court"" is another gimmick short to show off stage acts. Not as clever as the Paramount shorts like this, but still entertaining. (10 minutes)
1934 ""Hotel Anchovy"" stars the Ritz Brothers as Hotel operators hired to keep the failing business running until the owner can find a buyer. The double talk dialogue is almost non-stop making this the best short in the collection, but the film used for the transfer has quite a number of splices, some chopping out words. It is still easy to follow, but the film wear is distracting. (20 minutes)
1936 ""The Memory Lingers On"" is produced by Screen Memories and features many silent news reel clips from WW1, Opera Singer Caruso, boxing matches, a sound news reel of Will Rogers & Presidential candidate FRD, as well as some silent clips of William S. Hart, Fatty Arbuckle, Mable Normand, and the Keystone Kops. (9 minutes)

All of these come from 16mm prints either struck for television or the old Home Movie market.  All but ""Hotel Anchovy"" still look good, they are fairly sharp considering their 16mm source, and the prints are clean.

""Hotel Anchovy"" is the exception. There is a lot of film wear, notable jump splices that cut out words. And the picture quality is below the others, suggesting a print that is further away from the original negative. The focus is softer and the contrast is more washed out.  You can still enjoy it, but wish there was a better master.

Running under an hour, Alpha Video has given us only 1/3 what the DVD could hold. They could have included the entire uncut ""Medicine Man"" feature.",1315180800,4,2826,4.820247933884297
