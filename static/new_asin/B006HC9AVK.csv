8498299,3,B006HC9AVK,"Marc Chagall's portrait of Giselle -- illuminated by the seven-ton chandelier designed by 19th century architect Charles Garnier -- still looks down from the ceiling of the Palais Garnier, as it has on countless performances since the artist unveiled his painting in 1964. Because Giselle premiered in the City of Light in 1841, you might think the Opra national de Paris would present a definitive production of the classic work. Instead, this 2006 staging shows how familiarity can result in routine.

It's not a bad performance. It's just ordinary. For the price of this Blu-ray, that's not enough.

The often-grainy quality of the video doesn't help. This is one of the worst-looking Blu-rays I've seen. The image of La Scala's Giselle on regular DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giselle/dp/B005FAH1BG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giselle</a>&nbsp;is much sharper than this. Even more destructive are conductor Paul Connelly's ponderous tempos, which have more of a Wagnerian tread than a Gallic fleetness. As a result, the action on stage never has a chance to catch fire. It all seems rather weary.

As Giselle, Latitia Pujol turns in an adequate portrayal, although her acting becomes a bit melodramatic toward the end of Act I; but she doesn't rise to the level of Alina Cojocaru with the Royal Ballet or Svetlana Zakharova with La Scala. Nicolas Le Riche dances well, but he doesn't give Albrecht a firm characterization. And so it goes with the rest of the cast -- OK, but not special.

The Blu-ray contains no extras. Given the long history of Giselle in Paris and of the opulent Palais Garnier itself, this is an opportunity missed. The enclosed booklet provides no details about the dancers and includes only routine information about the ballet.

If you collect every halfway decent Giselle that hits the market, you'll be glad to have this one. Those seeking better value and superior performance should look to La Scala, the Royal Ballet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giselle-Blu-ray/dp/B001U5V04Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giselle [Blu-ray</a>], or the Dutch National Ballet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-Giselle-Blu-ray/dp/B002VR9QXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam: Giselle [Blu-ray</a>]. Those three productions offer exceptional performances in high-quality video. Who would have thought Paris could be so mundane by comparison?",1411862400,3,2489,6.1203438395415475
