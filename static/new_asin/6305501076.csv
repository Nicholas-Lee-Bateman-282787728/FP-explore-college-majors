You are missing a funny sequence with a  gay driver who picks up dolemite and the gang on their way to California!  Its in the video version, but missing in the DVD copy.

1038670,4,6305501076,"Pronounced ""tor-na-da"" this is a parody of Blaxploitation. It shows blacks in a bad light and white people worse. Dolemite (Rudy Ray Moore) starts the film off with a comedy routine that was more crude than funny, even for its day and age. In Alabama, Dolemite gets caught with the sheriff's wife which results in a self defense killing. Dolemite heads back to California where he hides in the open, assisting in club turf wars when he is not being paid for sex.

The nuts and bolts of the film are Ed wood bad. The sound didn't always match up to the scene (i.e. tires squeal after the car is stopped and guy is out the door) and the judo/karate/ninja moves would make ""The Hillybilly Ninja (U-Tube sensation) cringe. The film is laughable on a number of levels and who doesn't like women kidnapped, stripped, and tortured.

If you are new to the game here, this is Rudy Ray Moore bringing his most famous character from his night club comedy act to life, in the sequel to DOLEMITE.  This is a sequel that outdoes the original, and is the gold standard for all that is good about blaxploitation.  Its Star Wars for blaxploitation.  When other try to honor the genre (Black Dynamite) it is this movie they point to.  Its a movie made by guys who love movies, have a story to tell, and have a great time telling it.

Action, kung fu, bizarre characters, sex, romance, jokes, culture, guns, a racist sheriff who looks like Kenny Rogers in a leisure suit, its all here.  I mean, any movie where the director feels inclined to mention his Zodiac sign in the credits - its a classic.

1038766,5,6305501076,"When I was a teenager my brothers and I rented this film so long ago. It was ridiculous (but not inept) and the lackluster production values only ENHANCED the entertainment.

UNFORTUNATELY, as stated by other viewers....the DVD edition of this film omits a few scenes. Since I do not have a VHS copy of the film, I'm only aware of the shortened segment where the gang carjack a gay man for a ride (which leads to hilarity, done in a humorous style)

If someone should ever get their hands on the RIGHTS to these titles, I would love to see them restored. I've seen quite a few at retro theaters and this film as well as THE DISCO GODFATHER both appear much clearer on the big screen than these sometimes less than archival transfers.

THE FILM:

Hilarious. Everything from RRM's sexual ""interrogation"" which brings down the house, to Rudy jumping down a hill top buck naked (the viewer is given a replay ""So, you think I didn't JUMP??!! Well check this **** out!"" ) to the comedic character acting of the sheriff just scream a blatantly ridiculous but tremendously entertaining low budget film. DARE I FORGET TO MENTION the ""South American"" Karate Champion who conveniently appears at the party with nunchakus??

It's so bad, it's BRILLIANT. In the spirit of entertainment there is hardly a dull moment in the film. In fact, I think it's grown on me to the point of more appreciation. Although it doesn't have the abrupt ending that DISCO GODFATHER has (which was terrifyingly hilarious) I think the fact that Rudy comes out of a set up victorious is pretty hilarious.

If you're a fan of Rudy's films this is a must have for your collection. Too bad it's not entirely complete.

*Since Rudy was alive during the rereleasing of these films, it's obviously a shame that he wasn't approached for a commentary.

-The extras are the same as all the films in the ""Dolemite Collection"", poorly shot and recorded on location glimpses of Rudy's remembrances.
If you are patient, these can be informative as well as entertaining. It's just a shame less attention was given to making a stellar product and review. Hell, if I were a FILM STUDENT i would have done this as part of my thesis. It's a shame Rudy hasn't gotten the respect he's due as a low budget film maker.

JAMIE FOXX..... where ARE you????????!!

(Rudy Ray Moore bio anyone?? I have ALWAYS felt that Jamie would be the PERFECT RRM.... in particular the DISCO GODFATHER opening dance)

1038812,1,6305501076,A friend of mine while having a couple beers had mentioned seeing this movie years ago and this it hillarious.  Well I found it on Amazon and decided to buy it for him.

1038813,5,6305501076,You think that it can't get any better than the original but this is very close. A scene of him running away from the racist sheriff who's wife he was banging...then slowed down as he jumps naked into the bushes and rolls down into the Hollywood Hills. Funny cause this guy is a fat as hell but he thinks he has the body of a greek god which makes it even funnier.

1038849,5,6305501076,"First, I have to point out like one of the other reviewers, the company that released it has BUTCHERED the cut, scenes are put together out of order, stuff missing, etc.  Its almost to the point of ruining the film... Unfortunately, the video edition is so hard to find you might have to settle for it anyway... and still the scenes are great, but the cut will make the film feel far choppier than it actually was - - Ashame because I actually like this one more than Dolemite.  The opening credits alone with the ULTRA FUNKY MUSIC and the cheap opening credits is hillarious...  especially when we find out that Dolemite was so funky that he created his own form of Kung Fu that incorporated funky disco movies - - and when he wasn't practising Kung Fu he had some funky moves (and ladies) elsewhere.  In fact, while arguably many of the ladies on his album covers could look pretty nasty at times, the chicks in this film are built for speed - - and well exhibited.  Take the legendary ""interrogation"" scene with Mrs. Cavalette (when Dolemite ummmmmmmmm... questions her so hard, the hotel room starts collapsing from the ceiling...

Scene after scene in this top is over the top...  and the visits to those funky mid-70's dawn of disco clubs with cameo appearences from his posse make the film the ultimate Rudy Ray Moore Film...  from the music to the moves.

As for the plot... Well Dolemite's out of jail, and his club (Run by Lady Reed and her ""girls"") is doing too well... so the mafia steps in and kidnaps her best two gals...  Dolemite, however stirs up some trouble heading out West by getting caught screwing the hick sheriff's wife (featuring the famous scene where he jumps off the cliff butt naked, the film is freeze framed and Rudy announces, ""So y'all don't believe I jumped... well check this sh*t out ! ! !)  With the sheriff on his trail, and a mission to find his gals, things just get crazy and crazier as Dolemite show's that he has three weapons... his mind, his moves and a third one which I happen to forget for the time being.

If you're one of the people who consideres Rudy Ray Moore's humor IGNORANT and DEGRADING, this film definitely won't change your mind... and if you're a person who likes the '70s at its funkiest, jiviest and most off the wall...",1128988800,6,2284,4.516990291262136

I fell out of my chair laughing at some of the scenes in this movie - the opening scene where Dolemite dives head first down the side of a hill butt naked is classic!  This is Rudy Ray Moore at his best.

The plot makes little sense but who cares.  If you've seen the MadTV spoofs then and see this movie, you will realize they were dead on!!

Bottom line, if you're looking for fine art, don't bother.  If you're looking for cheap laughs and non-PC humor, this is your flick.",1091318400,13,621,4.220338983050848

Nothing beats Dolemite's , jokin', hustlin' kung-fu ways. NOTHING!!! Step off, Batman!!!

1038852,3,6305501076,"Ok, last time we caught up with the godfather of rap he beat willie green and crooked politicans in a brilliant film. This time I'm affraid, Rudy Ray Moore fumbles. The Human Tornando succumbs to the sequel disease of being worse than the first one. It's not horrible it's a very good movie, but it tries to be to formulatic , it wants to be as good as the first one and use sub-plots resembly the first one.
  The plot line, Dolemite leaves California behind and is somewhere in the south when he is caught with the sherrif's wife and jumps off a hill naked. The sherrif is pursuing him across the nation as dolemite puts his nightclub act on the go. He makes it back to Cali. and finds Queen Bee in some hot water with nightclub competiors, and Dolemite comes to the rescue. The movie's not horrible, but not as good as the 1st. It sometimes is choppy, hard to follow, and complete nonsense ( even more than in the original) Dolemite saves the day of course but a weird ending leaves you wanting a bit more well enough to leave on a high point. Remember the first had witty comebacks, and two rap songs performed you'll be lucky to catch him even run into rhyme this time. All in all this was good, close but no cigar.",1014940800,5,1220,4.3
