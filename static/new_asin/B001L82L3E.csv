8317539,1,B001L82L3E,"Not the movie I was looking for.  There is an Emanuelle movie that has the main character traveling to Africa. This wasn't it. This movie was dull.
Found the Emanuelle movie I was looking for, but for some reason, it is edited, like there was something in it that adult viewers have never seen before. Like it was too provocative, or something. I remember when that movie was broadcast on subscription cable at least three times a week -- unedited and not ""after hours"". Makes no sense. The unedited version of that particular movie has some brief, random explicit scenes that make the movie more surreal.",1431734400,,605,4.7075471698113205
