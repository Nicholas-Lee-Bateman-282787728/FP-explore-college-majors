8416299,4,B0044TL0I4,"I read the reviews about receiving the wrong concert footage. That stinks. I did receive the correct concert but it gets cut off with a few minutes left of the last song (Smoke on the Water). That was a little disappointing but overall I am very pleased with this concert DVD. I've never seen any footage of JLT with Rainbow so I was giddy when I received this for Father's Day. I think the quality is great considering how old it is. It is no Live After Death (1985 Iron Maiden concert) kind of quality but it was decent enough. I was also pleased with the camerawork. I figured I'd get one (maybe two if I was lucky) cameras filming the show. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized there were many cameras and some great angles and close-ups. The sound is great too, again considering it is from 1984. JLT sounds fantastic at first but his voice starts to wane a bit as the show goes on. I'm not complaining, just telling it like it is. Overall I think the show was great considering how rare it is. If you are a BIG fan of the JLT-era Rainbow, this DVD is for you. If you simply tolerated the JLT era, then don't buy the DVD.",1340323200,,1132,4.24537037037037

8416301,1,B0044TL0I4,the cd i got stated it was a live concert with joe lynn turner but when i put the cd in the player to my surprise it was someone else and it was titled Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. Bad quality and very dissapointed that Joe Lynn Turner was not on vocals .,1309910400,,255,4.019607843137255

8416303,1,B0044TL0I4,"This is not the Final Rainbow from Japan 1984 with Joe Lynn Turner - this a a bootleg of the Rockpalast show from
1995 with Doogie White on vocals from Germany. The listing here and even the DVD box pictures and track listing
indicate that it is the 1984 JLT Japan show, but the DVD within contains the 1995 Rockpalast Doogie show - and
very, very poor quality as well. I already own a bootleg of the 1995 Rockpalast show that is MUCH better quality
that what I received - in fact, you can find better quality and complete coverage of the 1995 Rainbow RockPalast
show on youtube. Not only is it completely the wrong show, the quality is horrendous with a dark grainy picture
and lost, ambient audio.

Somebody somewhere has screwed this up big time.

Buyer Beware.",1303603200,5,764,4.489208633093525
8416304,1,B0044TL0I4,"The actual program content on this DVD (at least on the DVD I received) is not even remotely what is advertised.

Purportedly on offer here is a DVD of an April 1984 Rainbow performance (with Joe Lynn Turner on vocals) recorded in Tokyo, Japan. At least that's what the the text on the DVD box art states. Even the photos accompanying that text on the DVD box art likewise appear to be from that 1984 concert, depicting Turner singing and Roger Glover on bass (both of whom were a part of that era's lineup of the band).

HOWEVER... when I pop the DVD I received from Amazon into my player, what do I see? Not that 1984 Japan performance with Joe Lynn Turner. No. Instead, and quite unaccountably, I see a completely different concert, from a completely different era of the band, with a completely different personnel lineup.

Despite the fact that even the colorful artwork printed upon the face of the DVD disk itself again represents itself as ""Live In Japan 1984"" (and again features those same Turner-era photos), when actually played back on my TV this DVD presents a circa 1995 (or subsequent) performance of the latter-day and short-lived Rainbow incarnation featuring Doogie White on vocals (a lineup formed right after Ritchie Blackmore's final departure from Deep Purple, and right before he subsequently abandoned Rainbow altogether and instead formed Blackmore's Night).

The video image quality of this DVD is also quite poor, but that's a separate issue altogether. The big problem is that this DVD does not contain the concert it says it contains.

Even the song list printed on the back of the DVD case (the correct list for the advertised-but-missing Japanese concert by the 1984 Joe Lynn Turner-era lineup) also turns out to be completely different from the song list that is actually displayed in the DVD's onscreen menu. For example, the DVD menu's song list includes several songs from that much later, Doogie White-era lineup's own 1995 ""Stranger In Us All"" album.

At first, I was ready to cry foul (as in ""false advertising""). But now I'm wondering, after reading other reviewers of this item here -- at least some of whom seem to confirm that their own copies do indeed contain the 1984 Turner-era Japan concert that is utterly absent from the copy I received -- if perhaps some weird and hopefully rare manufacturing screwup might have resulted in some of these DVDs containing the wrong concert. Did somebody roll the wrong video master during one of the DVD pressing cycles, or something?

Either way, it all boils down to the fact that I did not receive the item I ostensibly paid for. Nothing against Doogie White, or that latter era (and final swansong lineup) of Rainbow; but after all, the DVD I received is not the product that was advertised here, and not the product that the DVD box art I now hold in my hands claims that it is. Any way to rectify this, Amazon?",1298505600,7,2900,4.753479125248509
8416305,4,B0044TL0I4,"we have waited many years to finally see, and own the famous japanese concerts rainbow performed in 1984.i believe these were the only shows they did, being the reunion of deep purple mark 2 was close at hand.the video quality is definitely good, as is the sound.i think that the company that released this could of done a better job with the dvd format, being the menu, and presentation. i noticed that there were 2 glitches during playback as well. i was annoyed that the last song smoke on the water gets cut off about half way through. there's no excuse for that.unprofessional to say the least.having read some of the other reviews i understand there were credits and interviews left out as well.i guess we can't have it all.knowing how rare this footage is, i would say it is worth getting for the die-hard fan.ritchie blackmore and joe lynn turner are up to par in their performances.it's always great to see quality vintage footage of blackmore playing.now when are they going to release a dvd of deep purple live in 1985?waited long enough!!",1297641600,,1050,4.711956521739131
8416306,5,B0044TL0I4,"Bootleg quality? In regards to what a bootleg tape. I don't know what kind of equipment the reviewer has who had nothing but bad things to say about this DVD and it seems anyother one he reviews, but the quality is excellent, not as good as Munich 77 which is almost the Holy Grail of DVD concerts, but it is excellent. The sound quality is better than excellent. It's almost two hours long, every Blackmore solo is shown from the front. Turner singing Catch the Rainbow was excellent.

If you like Rainbow and Blackmore, you will love this DVD. The other reviewer must have been watching on a 13 inch black and white tv and listening on AM Radio to the sound.

I had to further comment on the response to the post that diagrees with me. Every time someone buys a bootleg concert, the band doesnt get paid. Maybe other bands won't want to put out their classic concerts, if they know most people will steal it. I don't mind paying 20 Dollars to see the greatest musicians ""ever"" perform live. Blackmore will go down in history as an equivalent to Bach or Beethoven. If you don't want to spend 20 dollars to see him perform, there is something wrong with you.",1296086400,11,1158,4.431924882629108
8416307,1,B0044TL0I4,"For the ones that got a different concert that is a seller responsibility...They are selling what is not correct, I got the right material, but horrible quality, and as I promised in my reply to another fellow here, I will try to describe the quality of the production, not the material itself...

I downloaded the same material some time ago from a torrent, indeed a Japanese bootleg from the TV show, and I was looking for a decent production of this concert, unfortunately not this case at all. This one does not have the annoying MP in white on the top left corner all the time from the TV station, and it does not have the spelling errors on the menu or in the scrolling titles (in the old bootleg the title Miss Mistreated was spelled wrong, in both menu and scrolls) but the downside, it that it has a couple of drops in the audio/video from the tape, and Smoke on the Water was cut in the middle, not sure why, and they removed the all the credits, and the interview with the band members, that are present on the bootleg I had. Quality wise, this is exactly the same mediocre produced material if not worse. And don't tell that me that it is due the fact that it was recorded in 1984, we have excellent recordings from that time and even older, especially from Japan...
The packing was also horrible, the printed fold was horrible, no booklet inside, and it comes in a horrible blueish/softly dollar store DVD case of a really poor quality, with a piece of foam holding the disc in, the printing on the disc goes outside the printable area, getting almost the edge of the disc, outside the printable coating, same in the center, Please guys find a designer for the covers, they used like five completely different fonts, and of the wrong size for the cover, some of them very annoying by the way...I could keep on going, but honestly it is not worthy...the 1977 Munich concert is far better production, looks like a BluDisc in comparison.
So for any decent audio/videophile, this one is not worthy a penny, for a Blackmore fan, of course...My advice, unless you can get it for cheap, not a good investment at all...period...As a funny note, the audio in my Oppo says, 1/1 German Dolby Digital stereo, not sure what the hell is the German Dolby stereo, specially when it was recorded in Japan...Sorry guys, or whomever made them in the basement of God knows where, but I will sell it again, the cutting of Smoke on the Water, was the culprit...guys that is a rip off...period, stay away from this kind of shady mediocre productions...

Updates: I found another bootleg around that has the full video of the Budokan 1984 concert, including the interviews with the band members, I got it yesterday, with no MP on the top corner, and no misspellings, a decent menu, and it includes the Live Between the Eyes as well, a nice addition, and all come in a single DVD-5...get that one instead, and wait for a decent production of this very good and unique material...",1294099200,12,2967,4.54392523364486
