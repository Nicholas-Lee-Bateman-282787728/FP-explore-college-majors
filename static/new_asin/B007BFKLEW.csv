5073457,5,B007BFKLEW,I may be biassed because my grandparents came from Finland.  The movie is very well done and as far as I know historically accurate.  The movie is in Finnish with a variety of subtitles.  I actually liked the Finnish audio because it maintained the authenticity of the film.,1390521600,4,274,4.666666666666667
5073458,3,B007BFKLEW,"Not in my opinion...what it could have been...Poor directing and poor screen play. Compared to Enemy At The Gates, this was a junior high school production.",1363910400,2,156,5.038461538461538

8513739,5,B007BFKLEW,This purchase was bought as a Christmas gift for a friend who is into Military history (as am I). I bought it for him because I have a copy. It is a really great look at the Russo-Finnish war.,1485216000,,192,3.948717948717949

8513744,5,B007BFKLEW,"Excellent account on one of the many wars unknown to us. Well, at least, some of us.",1426204800,,84,4.0
8513745,5,B007BFKLEW,A little monotonous at points but that may be part of the intent so the viewer feels like the Finns depicted.  Special effects are pretty good and the personalities are a little harder to follow watching the English subtitles.  There is some nudity for a few seconds on the second DVD.,1417824000,,285,4.568627450980392
