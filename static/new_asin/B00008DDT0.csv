7981582,4,B00008DDT0,"So, as the other reviews kinda' say, the Video Quality is ""Less Than Great"". I've had this DVD for several years and it ""Was"" one of the most played DVD's in my 80's Collection. Many times I wouldn't even turn on the TV, just use the Audio while doing projects. Enjoyable with all his 80's Hits - ""Live"", even as ""Background Noise"". I say ""Was"" one of the most played DVD's in that, being an 80's Freak, I finally managed to pick up the Concert on a Japanese issue Digital Audio LaserDisc....... Even with a roughly 20 year old LD, it ""Smoked"" the DVD. Excellent Video Quality!!!! If You still have a LD Player, look for the LD, if not, this DVD ""Works"" as the ""Only 80's Archive on the Block"" - Till somebody does a Better Release of it. There are also several Live Clips on the Lionel Richie VHS/LaserDisc ""All Night Long"" from 1984 which has His Videos of All Night Long, Running With The Night, Hello, Penny Lover and Concert Takes of Running With The Night and All Night Long. Another place to find ""Live Lionel"" is on a 1992 LaserDisc (probably VHS) release ""Lionel Richie - Back to Front"". It has a Live performance of All Night Long at the 1984 Olympics and Easy at the 1978 American Music Awards. Included are an assortment of His other Videos, up to that date.",1205193600,,1270,4.385593220338983
7981583,2,B00008DDT0,"The show was registered in 1987 in Rotterdam and sold as a VHS-tape. The DVD is simply a copy of this tape. The sound quality is with my surround equipment better as on the tape, whereas the video signal is worse. However I still enjoy the show very much and I am glad I bought the DVD. There is no region code, so the DVD should play anywhere (the television screen should be able to show NTSC).",1061596800,3,396,4.1558441558441555
7981584,3,B00008DDT0,"This DVD, as you would know by now, is sometime in the eighties. I remember attending the same tour that this concert is from and just totally loving the show. Here we have a concert with all the songs of the early Richie times, but the let down is the picture quality is poor. Or perhaps I should say, not that great. If you're expecting quality, don't look here. If you want a record of the tour - then buy it. You'll probably watch it once, maybe twice, but that's it.",1056931200,4,471,4.186813186813187
7981585,1,B00008DDT0,"I am a great fan of Lionel Richie. He is one of the best singer that is why I collect his music cds and watch his concert in Hawaii last Feb. 2003 and as soon as I saw his Outrageous live performance on DVD I bought it right away at SunCoast, when I watch it, the sound and video was poor in quality, in my observations, the DVD is like from the VHS tapes that was transfer to DVD and the sound was not stable in my High Fidelity system, I keep adjusting the bass and treble to have a good quality sound. The picture of Lionel Richie on the menu screen looks current but the concert seems to me sometime in the late 1980's. Overall the publisher of this import DVD is misleading the fans of Lionel Richie.",1056758400,2,705,4.079136690647482
7981586,2,B00008DDT0,"First of all, I thought this DVD was going to be recent.  I guess I misunderstood when www. Amazon.com said it would be available February 21, 2003.  However, they had trouble obtaining the DVD, so I had to order through ebay.  I would say the concert in the DVD takes place in 1987.  Right after his ""Dancing on the Ceiling"" album.  Everybody looks 80ish.  The quality isn't that great either and the special effects are cheesy.  I also think the piano playing the songs by itself is cheesy and disappointing.  I would much rather see Richie play ""Hello"" and ""Truly"" than some fancy piano.  Unless you are a die hard Lionel Richie fan, I wouldn't suggest this 60 minute music DVD.",1047859200,9,681,4.56198347107438
