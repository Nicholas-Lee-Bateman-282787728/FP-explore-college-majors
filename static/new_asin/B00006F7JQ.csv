7967779,2,B00006F7JQ,"Perhaps I should have known from the title - ""Basics Step by Step,"" right?  I figured this would be a complete workout, and I was wrong.  This entire thing is just an instructional video to demonstrate the basic yoga poses.  Disappointing in that regard.  If you've never done yoga and you just want to understand how to properly align your body and understand the fundamentals than you will probably like this.  If you are looking for a complete yoga workout (like I was) you will be disappointed.",1133568000,3,498,4.67816091954023
7967780,5,B00006F7JQ,"I've been a big fan of Bryan's original three tape video series (Energize/Tone/Sweat) for some time now. I've been doing yoga daily for close to 8 years now, study with a wonderful teacher and have well over 70 yoga videos in my collection that I rotate with (though I certainly have my favorite practices that get more time than others) so I've got some experience with these types of programs.
 Bryan Kest is one of my favorite Yoga teachers because has a really down to earth teaching style and he's very knowledgeable and sincere. He always stresses that the breathing and equanimity are the most important aspects of Yoga. He also stresses listening to your body and modifying when needed.
 I was glad to see that he came out with this Power Basics video because it gives folks who have never done Yoga before (or Power Yoga in particular)an excellent starting point.
 This program primarily consists of the Sun Salutations (A and B) which he breaks down very methodically so that you can really get comfortable with each movement. After going thru the A Salutation very slowly he then moves through a faster flow of it. Then he does the same thing with the B Salutation.
 The Sun Salutations contain the basics for anything else you might do in yoga and give tremendous benefits in and of themselves. Plus, they build heat in the body which makes the muscles supple. Another important facet of Sun Salutations is that they are breath led movements which work as a moving meditation.
 He follows these with a seated forward bend and a lying twist  before moving into relaxation pose.
 Throughout the program he has one student who modifies the entire routine which is helpful to new students who may not know how to do this.
 Though I am experienced with yoga I still enjoyed this program because I was pretty tired this morning and wasn't up for a really intense routine.  I found this program gave me just what I needed this morning without overtaxing me.
 Also, the length of the video is only about 27 or so minutes after the introduction. I like his introduction because I think he really helps you understand where he's coming from as a teacher and what he feels should be emphasized. I usually use intro's on yoga videos to do some light floor stretches before getting into the actual program, plus it helps me get into the mindset of the practice to come.
 Anyway, I would highly recommend this video or any of Bryan's work. He is definitely the real deal!
 Namaste",1083456000,3,2478,4.658256880733945
