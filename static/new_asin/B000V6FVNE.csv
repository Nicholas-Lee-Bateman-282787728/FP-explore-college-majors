But the story is just no good and goes nowhere. Except for an incident involving a cake of soap the suspense level is a neat zero. Everybody is over acting like hell in the sense of - hey, look how funny I am! At first I thought that the movie wants to address serious issues like the plight of senior citizens. But basically all inmates of the residence are dipicted as demented morons. I really found that hard to swallow. But I guess this is basically a question of style and I just don't like this particular style (I also have difficulties with movies by Emir Kusturica, for that matter ...)
Students of the Spanish language might find this a rewarding experience. As far as I can judge, all characters speak fine, perfectly enunciated Spanish, it's fairly easy to understand. Oh yes, and there's a very cute police woman in this movie, too!",1197849600,,1002,4.541436464088398
