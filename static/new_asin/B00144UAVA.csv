8603300,3,B00144UAVA,"Let me start by saying that I was surprised over the quality of the DVD. I know in the description it says ""remastered from the 90s"", but I didn't think it was going to look like someone's home video. However, the magic circle exercises that she demonstrates (which are mostly for your arms and legs - no core work) are all very good and somewhat challenging. I don't really see me using the DVD again because its more of a how-to and not a full pilates routine. Those looking for an intermediate/advanced routine, I would skip this DVD.",1294272000,3,537,4.489795918367347

8603302,5,B00144UAVA,"This workout really makes your muscles burn in the targeted areas!  For some of the exercises, you might have trouble at first completing the # of reps shown on the workout.  The instruction is upbeat, and you are encouraged to maintain proper form at all times.  It's nice to have a goal to work towards.  Hopefully, the workout will get easier for you with practice, AND you will see and feel terrific toning results.",1203552000,5,419,4.621621621621622
