I noticed about 5 minutes in that, for no apparent reason, they only ever refer to the main character by his full name. ""Jeff Chang is missing."" ""What's wrong with Jeff Chang?"" It was weird, and got annoying. We bought the instant video and the quality of stream was good.

Best friends Miller (Teller) and Casey (Astin) show up to take their friend Jeff Chang out for his 21st birthday. Jeff Chang fights them because of his big chance at med school and his father threatens them. None of this stops the friends and one beer turns into a night that none of them will remember, or forget. After the last few movies like this I have seen I was leery of seeing this. I will admit that this was funny and I laughed almost the whole way through. I think the best thing about this movie though is that it doesn't try to be something it's not. The movie is just a frat house comedy about kids getting drunk, no sub plot, no trying to make a statement, just drinking and fun. On the other hand though I thought the movie was funnier and better when it was called Harold & Kumar. Overall, if you like the Harold & Kumar type movies then you will like this one as well. I was surprised at how much I laughed. I give it a B.",1370649600,2,1022,4.14070351758794

5671006,3,B00BT7664M,"I read the good reviews and the bad reviews before I saw this movie. After I finished watching the movie, I thought, it's your average comedy. The movie has some worth wild, funny moments, but overall, I wouldn't watch this movie more than once.

The best thing the movie had going for it was the acting. But, the direction and story wasn't that good though. The movie is very predicable and you already know what going to happen next.

It felt like the writers used a basic plot and just added whatever to keep it funny. Then, towards the end, they threw in some more random events and just ended it.

The movie doesn't set itself up for a sequel per se, but, it is possible to do one. They ended the movie, where they're all in college and happy. They're just living life care free and don't know what going to happen in the future. So, it's possible to pick up from that in the next movie.

I recommend this movie, if you have nothing else to watch-- you just want to see a average comedy for the heck of it. Then, this is it.",1367625600,,1029,4.23469387755102

5671008,3,B00BT7664M,"Nicole (Sarah Wright) states the theme when she says, ""Oldest friends are the weirdest friends."" In this story two ""odd couple"" friends Miller (Miles Teller) and Casey (Skylar Astin) decide to take out mutual friend Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) on his 21st birthday to the objection of Chang's father (Franois Chau).

Miles Teller plays a colorful character who caught the essence of John Belushi from ""Animal House"" as well as a few of his lines. He was refreshing to watch as the other two actors were essentially straight men for him. Chang passes out and has an important appointment the next day. His friends frantically try to locate his house, even though they were there just hours ago. The film consists of the cast of cliche characters they encounter through their drunken night as they find out things about Jeff that are contrary to what they knew of him as a friend.

The film starts out fairly decent, even up through the first bar scene. After that it starts to slide into a ""been there done that, got the t-shirt"" mode where the fun has worn off and you wait for something original to happen.

""21 and over"" is definitely for 21 and under.

5671009,5,B00BT7664M,"""21 & Over"" was THE most enjoyable and hilarious film I've seen this year thus far. It is tons better then the overrated ""Identity Thief"" I've also seen almost every wide release film since the start of the year. I know I'll get some hate for this but personally I thought it was better then ""The Hangover"" although it's very similar it's easier to relate being a college student. Unlike ""Project X"", ALL the characters in this film were very likeable and equally as funny. Adding the ""bromance"" brotherhood message into the plot only helped it. I laughed throughout the entire film and this is the ONLY movie I've ever seen three times in the theater and I'd still see it again. I can't wait until the blu-ray release and hope it comes with an extended or unrated cut. I actually hope they make a sequel. This deserves one over ""Project X""!! Trust me, if you like teen comedies and you're a college student there's no way you won't like it!",1363564800,5,941,4.508771929824562
5671010,1,B00BT7664M,"Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (writers of The Hangover) write and direct 21 and Over, staring Skylar Astin as Casey and Miles Teller as Miller, two friends that visit their old high-school buddy, Jeff Chang (Justin Chon), on his 21st birthday.  Instead of staying in and getting a good nights rest before an important medical school interview in the morning, Jeff Chang decides to go out on the town with his friends.  An array of absurdity breaks out after Jeff Chang becomes so inebriated that hes unable to tell his friends where he lives.  Now, his friends are on a quest to find someone that knows where he lives, so they can get their friend home before his dad picks him up for the medical school interview in the morning.  Sarah Wright, Francois Chau, and Jonathan Keltz also star in supporting roles.

This film isn't without a few notable, entertaining moments.  As it turns out, there are some filmmakers that are learning not to put the funniest moments in the trailers.  Obviously, you won't be getting any specifics here about those moments  and while there were a few laugh-out-loud chuckles, they were basically out of pity for such a pathetic film.  To be completely honest, theres a total lack of meaningful substance in this so-called comedy.  If anything, this film is nothing more than a bunch of silly excuses to parade a couple of teenage guys around a college campus  naked, no less.  For once, its the men being completely degraded (aside from one particular scene in the girls sorority).  Regardless, the abundance of needless male nudity is just one of the countless reasons to stay as far away from this film as humanly possible.

Unlike the films of the past, youll find no Porkys shower scene here, or a ladder leading to the sorority sisters window.  Instead, its more like a Weekend at Bernies  since the majority of the film is two friends carrying their drunken friend from place to place, all while trying to find his house.  Oddly enough, the drunken friend sleeps the whole movie, while the other two friends consume an enormous amount of alcohol without even the slightest buzz.  When the film starts to drag, the writers simply create a scene to throw someone out of a third story window.  And  when all else fails, find a poorly written bully to accost them, and throw in a sorority girl that has nothing better to do than to run into the same two people everywhere they go.

Overall, bad writing and cheap attempts to create laughs make this an excruciating film to watch.  While the acting is bearable, the plot is demeaning, racist, sexist  and flat out stupid.  Never in a million years should this film be viewed more than once  if that.  21 and Over may have gotten a theatrical release, but it probably should have been straight-to-DVD, followed by a quick trip to the two dollar bin.

5671024,5,B00BT7664M,"This is my absolute favorite movie. So basically...
Justin Chon (Jeff Chang) plays as a college student who has just turned 21. His two best friends from high school, (Miller) and (Casey) decide to take him out to a couple bars to celebrate this grand event. Upon arriving at Jeff Chang's apartment, they run into a teacher Indian dancing who has mental problems. Jeff Chang has an interview in the morning to become a doctor, so he feels uneasy going out to party before an important interview, especially with his strict father on his shoulders reminding him to focus on a future that Jeff Chang doesn't even want. Miller convinced him to just go to a couple bars and in the end, Jeff Chang gets too wasted and passes out. Both Miller and Casey don't know how to get Jeff Chang home because Miller left the address at the house. The rest of the movie consists of these two best friends running around the college campus trying to get their best friend home. It's a hilarious movie and has a lot of dry humor, but I would only recommend it to 15 year olds and up because of the profanity and nudes.

Something similar in the movie happened in the building next to my dorm.  A bio major person who failed to get an A in First Aid wanted to jump off the building.  He was a very good student in high school but he wasn't good enough to get good grades in college.  All other pre-med students received an A.  He though life was over for him.

5671061,2,B00BT7664M,"First of all, adding curse words all over the place does not make things funnier. A well placed expletive can definitely add a comedic punch, but when overused takes away from everything. Every other word uttered by the main character seemed like it was a curse word. At times it almost made the dialogue incomprehensible.

The story is about 3 high school friends who reunite to celebrate their friend's 21 birthday. All three use the entire night to let loose and relive their crazy high school days of drinking and partying. The thing is, their friend has an extremely important interview for med school in the morning.

I'm not going to lie, this movie had some funny scenes. A lot of it was so random, much like the Hangover movies, that you couldn't help but laugh. Most of it, however, was simply too unrealistic to be funny. And the use of racist language seemed unnecessary and uncalled for. It could have easily been removed and nothing would have changed.

Within the first 5 minutes I could tell I wasn't going to be a fan of the movie. The main character was completely unlikeable throughout, which was evident from the cab scene. It only spiraled downhill from there, as he continued making one bad decision after the other, bringing his friends down with him. He does learn something in the end by re-enrolling in college, but his partying days are clearly not over. Not saying he has to always stay the straight and narrow, but when you have two nights when you stay out all night and get into some of the situations these guys did, it is time to reconsider your life decisions.

If you have an hour and a half with absolutely nothing else to kill, then this isn't the worst movie available. But be warned that you have to sit through a lot of failed attempts at one liners and bizarre events to actually get a decent chuckle going.",1394150400,,1848,4.574018126888218

The story is, not surprisingly, about young males Casey (Astin) and Miller (Teller) celebrating their best friend and straight-A college student Jeffs (Chon) 21st birthday, getting drunk, and doing very silly things, while Jeff has an important interview to attend the next day.

Yes, its basically the same concept as in Hangover, in which the best friends lose a bridegroom on the very wedding day. 21 & Over attempts a similar tack but to much less effective results. Here, two best friends have to wander around the town with Jeff passing out, trying to locate Jeffs room. As Nicole (Sarah Wright), a nice girl they met at a bar, seems to know Jeff and his address, they go to a sorority house where she lives.

The story is not only impossible, but formulaic. The male leads are not very likable. And worst of all, those jokes, mainly about guys doing stupid things, are feeble. My advice is, just forget this and watch Hangover again.",1387584000,,1190,4.739130434782608

5671075,4,B00BT7664M,"21 & Over is the directorial debut from the writers of the Hangover trilogy, and it could have easily been called The Hangover Jr. It's Jeff Chang's 21st birthday and his High School friends show up to take him out. With a big interview in the morning, the boys are planning on taking it easy, but things don't quite turn out that way. I was expecting this film to be yet another chance to exploit the magic of the first Hangover film, but surprisingly it does not. The story has many similarities, but also a uniqueness about it. 21 & Over does manage to capture that amazing chemistry and magic that made the Hangover legendary. The whole time I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think, why didn't they put this kind of thought into the Hangover sequels? Don't get me wrong, I liked the sequels, but neither one of this is as good as this film was. Justin Chon, unfortunately only known from the Twilight series, stars in a role that was seemingly made for him. This guy was so freaking funny, that I had to be careful not to piss my pants, almost every time he opened his mouth. The other stand out is Project X's Miles Teller, and while he's much better looking than Alan, he does manage to capture that loveable extreme weirdness that Zack Galifinakis had. It's easy to look at 21 & Over and say it's going to be just like the Hangover, and you wouldn't be wrong. Parts of the film are eerily similar, but the youth factor and college atmosphere does give the film a life of it's own and trust me when I tell you, it was absolutely hysterical.",1385510400,,1558,4.375862068965517

""21 and Over"" is like a 21st Century version of ""Animal House"" and ""Porky's"" - only this one comes with a bit of a social conscience, as befits the times we live in.

Miles Teller,  Skylar Astin. and Justin Chon play buddies from childhood, now ending their time in college, who reunite to celebrate the 21st birthday of one of them, Jeff Chang (Chon). Astin's Casey is the stuffed shirt who's already on the fast track to a career on Wall Street after he graduates; Chon's Jeff is the stressed-out A-student whose dad is pressuring him to ace a med school interview the next day; and Teller's Miller  is the Stiffler-type wise-ass who refuses to grow up, convinced that the only life worth living is one patterned after the ""American Pie"" movies.

Against their better judgment, Astin and Teller- take Chon out for a celebratory bender, resulting in what anyone with any knowledge of how these things customarily work out in the movies can plainly predict. Yet, beyond all the drinking, brawling, sex rituals and generalized pandemonium, ""21 and Over"" actually has some poignant things to say about friendship and finding that fine line between becoming a mature adult and selling out to a life devoid of fun and joy. Luckily, the screenplay by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who also directed the film together) doesn't overdo it in the moralizing department, neatly balancing the insights with a steady stream of ultra-crass frat-boy hijinks. The movie even has some fun skewering the misogyny and sexual double standards that prevail among some of the male youth of today.

The movie is helped immeasurably by the performers who bring both humor and heart to the proceedings. They make the nonsense not only bearable but actually quite enjoyable at times.",1379462400,4,1763,4.899328859060403

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

So the basic premise of the story is that there are three college friends, one of which, Jeff Chang, just turned 21 today which means in the USA he can now legally go into bars and drink.  So his two buddies drag him out and go drinking at basically every bar they come to.  Because let's face it, when you turn 21 you do go out and drink because it's finally legal and they can't keep you out anymore.

So the character Jeff gets wasted beyond belief even though he has a college interview to med school tomorrow and he basically passes out from drinking way too much.  He gets into wacky situations as his friends try to get him back to his home so he can sleep it off and go to his interview in the morning.

Of course he has an overbearing father who wants him to go medical school when he doesn't really want to.  His two buddies learn that he isn't as perfect as he seems and the two re-connect over the course of the movie and they realize how much they all missed one another.  It has drinking jokes in it, it has topless women (Which is a staple for movies like this), it has party scenes and all the other things we've come to expect in these movies.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

All in all, it's nothing new.  It's cute and it appeals to the college and high school kids and those of us who remember college fondly and those of us who love college-type humor.

5671246,2,B00BT7664M,"Not another ""young adults (high school -or- college) drinking too much"" comedy genre movie? 21&OVER is predictable and the average moviegoer can predict the plot and connect-the-dots from point A-to-B, of each step of what's going to happen in this movie. The only thing the film had going for it, is that the film had actors [we] haven't seen before. So, it seemed fresh in that aspect. But that's all. That was one of the reasons of the success of the original THE HANGOVER (and surprise! '21' was written and directed by the original screenwriters of the THE HANGOVER). However, the differences between the two films is that, at least ONE of films was funny (and we know which one). '21' was excrutiating and cringe-worthy and this reviewer somehow didn't laugh at any of the situations and misadventures of a trio of high school/college buddies celebrating one of them coming-of-age (and now he can legally drink in bars): Jeff Chang (Justin Chon). He is about to embark on a medical career upon completing his pre-med studies at a northwest american university (the university & college town location shots were impressive). It's his 21st birthday, and his two friends want to take him out to go bar-hopping to celebrate.  As it is always hard not to stereotype asian characters in film, the creators did a good job not to. However, in a kind of reverse stereotyping they did however portrayed asian parent(s) as expecting their children to excel in academics. Which isn't too bad and they kind of made the asian parent a pretty strong (if not a very angry) asian figure. Overall, another film in a particular 'genre' that is a little bit recycled & devoid of any humor (dialogue and situation-wise).",1373155200,2,1705,4.839041095890411

There are some stereotypes in the movie, but the main characters have a good mix of realistic traits. Even the American Pie movie franchise portrays more old-school stereotypes than 21 & Over.
The plot contains only 2 small contrived problems to keep the partying, and the movie, going. But they are small, and make sense, really.
