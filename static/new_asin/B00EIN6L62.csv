Inside The American Mob was a long time in the making and for the first time really does give an accurate history and inside look at organized crime. Two things made this mini-series different from the others, the first being, the people they interviewed. National Geographic sits down with actual detectives, informants, agents, and even current members, who live the mob life. They tell stories that haven't been told before and as it turns out a lot of things we've been told before weren't quite right. The second difference is that this documentary focuses on the timeline, going from the beginning of the five families, all the way up to today. Yes, they talk about Gotti and Donnie Brasco, but they also focus intently on the big names that came in between and weren't as infamous. I have an odd fascination with organized crime and I watch mob documentaries and films fairly often, and I usually don't learn too much or meet people I didn't already know about. Inside The American Mob was completely different, as each of the six episodes introduced me to thing I never would have imagined, told to me by the people who were actually there.  National Geographic set out to film the definitive insiders guide to the mob and they succeeded.",1423440000,12,1417,4.7368421052631575

8605779,5,B00EIN6L62,For me it's the best look into the downfall of the mob. It focuses mostly in the 70's to 90's but does cover a little bit of earlier and later periods. But it is during the 20 year period from the 70s-90s that the mob will fall as the commission that Lucky Luciano started is dismantled causing the mob to never be as large and controlling as it once was. Great interviews by people on both sides who where there and just an overall great production quality makes for one of if not the best documentaries on the mob.,1434931200,6,516,4.222222222222222
