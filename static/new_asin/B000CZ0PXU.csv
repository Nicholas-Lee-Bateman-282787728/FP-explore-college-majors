8102297,1,B000CZ0PXU,"This is probably the worst lesbian drama ever produced with a discoursive storyline filled with inanity and an incoherent plot that fails to take the story in a meaningful direction and leaves the viewer curious as to the real intent of the story and the purpose with which they viewed the movie.

If you're interested in some engaging lesbian drama, look instead towards Elena Undone, Loving Annabele, Blue is the Warmest Color, The Perfect Ending, or Spider Lilies.

Stay away at all costs.",1418169600,2,492,4.9156626506024095
