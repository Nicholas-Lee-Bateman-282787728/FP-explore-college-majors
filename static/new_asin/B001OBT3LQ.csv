8330311,4,B001OBT3LQ,"I am related my marriage to the late Jackie Paris, and still close to his ex-girlfriend, who is now in her 80's, and still beautiful! Jackie was a talented guy, in the same vocal range as Frank Sinatra. Very smooth. He was also a miserable ass, and I wanted to see for myself if the movie portrayed him correctly. It did.",1368144000,,321,4.278688524590164
8330312,4,B001OBT3LQ,"I had never heard of Jackie Paris -- before my time -- but found this film to be quite captivating.  Like a trainwreck.  I could not look away, even though I had a sense things were going to get messy.  His voice is fine, it's Jackie who got in his own way.  The main reason I watched this documentary was because the director had also made the wonderfully flawed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-Island/dp/B0036TGT8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City Island</a>&nbsp;with Andy Garcia.  One gets the sense that the director knew he needed something to make this film work -- aside from injecting himself into it -- and he got it.  Right at the end.  I will not give it away, but it's worth the entire journey just for that surprise.  Fascinating.",1316563200,3,791,5.32258064516129
8330313,5,B001OBT3LQ,"The career arc of Jackie Paris--widely considered one of the greatest jazz singers of all time--is studded with a tragic succession of ""what ifs."" What if he hadn't turned down an invitation to join Duke Ellington after being the first white vocalist to tour with Lionel Hampton? What if his live performances with Charlie Parker had been recorded and released? And, not least, what if temperament, bad luck and ineffectual representation hadn't conspired to prevent him from grabbing the brass ring and becoming, say, another Tony Bennett? These are some of the intriguing questions that filmmaker Raymond De Felitta pursues in this engrossing, emotionally compelling documentary. De Felitta became obsessed with Paris after hearing him on a Los Angeles radio station. By that time, Paris had dropped so far off the collective cultural radar that a jazz encyclopedia listed him as having died in 1977. Paris' best decade was the 1950s, during which he was the first singer to record the song ""Round Midnight,"" was named Best New Male Vocalist for 1953 by Downbeat magazine, recorded two albums under his own name, and earned accolades from the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Charles Mingus. Yet somehow, mainstream stardom eluded him. Paris also fell victim to changing musical tastes, as the jazz-inflected 1950s made way for the rock-dominated 1960s. Having found Paris living in New York City, De Felitta recorded a number of on-camera interviews with the charismatic singer, and fleshed out his film with archival footage, still photos, audio clips, and interviews with singer Anne Marie Moss (one of Paris' ex-wives), plus musicians Billy Taylor, James Moody, Billy Vera and several others. De Felitta's film not only attempts to answer the question of why Paris never hit it big, but, perhaps more important, explores the very nature of creativity and all the obsessions, good intentions, and personal demons that fuel it. ""Tis Autumn: The Search for Jackie Paris,"" is essential viewing for anyone interested in jazz, and in what separates winners and also-rans, not only in music, but in any walk of life.",1243382400,16,2111,5.1574344023323615
