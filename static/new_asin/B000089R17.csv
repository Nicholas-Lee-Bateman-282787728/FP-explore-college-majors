I like that you can customize your workwouts by selecting the routines that you want to do, but I feel kinda lost with what is the best ones to do. I use Leslie Sansone walking videos more.",1365552000,,276,4.12962962962963
7980841,5,B000089R17,"I have a 2 year old and I kept my baby weight on for over a year after I had my son.  I didn't want to go to the gym and one day I discovered Sharon Mann on FIT TV.  I immediately liked Sharon Mann because they weren't focusing on different body parts like the other shows.  And she's so upbeat, infectious, and encouraging.  I've been working out to the DVD's for the past 6 months.  And I've lost 43 pounds so far and have come down 4 dress sizes. I've found the variety to be exciting and challenging and I highly recommend this set to anyone that is serious about losing weight and looking good.",1108684800,12,599,4.129310344827586
7980842,5,B000089R17,"I have increased my strength and flexibility and challanged myself in ways I would not have thought I could.  I am nearly 40 years old and in better shape now than I was when I was 21.  Sharon Mann has 4 people with her and covers 5 levels of intensity.  With this series you can choose the type of warm up, workout and cool down.  She covers every form of exercise from Tai Chi to flexible strenghtening to kickboxing to military drills.  She's awsome.",1105574400,14,453,4.345238095238095
7980843,5,B000089R17,"I exercise daily with this DVD set and have gone from size 12 to 6/8 in less than a year.  Best of all, I am very tone, not skin and bones.  The workouts offer variety and motivation.  I started exercising with Sharon on FitTV in the mornings, but find the DVD set much more efficient and flexible.  I started with only weights for equipment, but did buy a step, ball and stretch bands in the end.  It's money well spent and much, much cheaper than a gym.",1104537600,10,455,4.183908045977011
7980844,1,B000089R17,"I bought Sharon Mann's The Works DVD Series because I was impressed with the thought of all the Workout Combinations and Building my Own Workouts with the new DVD Technology.  Im sure that Idea will go far in the Industry. The DVD is actually made up of parts of the segments from the In Shape With Sharon Mann TV Series thats out of production but airs reruns on WTN and Fit TV.  All they did was piece together different parts of her shows. I think that is good, because you don't have to worry about Commercial Interuptions you get on TV and you can pick the segments you want to work out to.

Sharon Mann is pleasant and motivated with a positive Disposition.  But she is no (Billy Blanks!).  She maintains a professional demeaner throughout the Series.  She does not add a lot of her own personality to the Video, nor does she discuss anything except the the workout at hand.  I found the Workouts to be OK but I was very disappointed about a number of things.

1. After not working out for a number of months. The only muscles I felt after what I thought would be a difficult work out with Sharon Mann, didn't really affect me much at all. It wasn't a really difficult work out and my muscles weren't sore at all, except for a part of my legs. I am accustomed to full body workouts so two days later I worked out to Tae Bo Advanced and I really I had a great workout! I felt almost every musle in my body the next day. I definitely had a better Full Body Workout with Tae Bo than with Mann's the Works DVD's. If you're anything like me and you want to get a good full body work out or a tough work out that really works and tones your muscles then Mann's Videos may not be for you.  But if you like medioker type work outs with Lots of Variety then you may possibly like this series.

2. Mann tends to use a great variety of equipment on the DVD's such as, Balls, Bars, Pilates Rings and other pilates and yoga equipment,she also uses weights, and step equipment. I couldn't help but get the feeling that she tried too hard to prove she could ""do it all"", or maybe prove that she can do every kind of exercise out there and that she can use every piece of equipment on the Market. I am a firm believer in Quality not Quanity.

3. She does have three levels on the Video. Low Impact, Medium and Advanced.  The Beginner or Low impact are on the Left and don't use equipment(but not always) Sharon In the Middle usually does the Medium Impact using equipment and those on the Right, High Impact use more advanced techniques on the equipment.  Not All Segments use equipment, but many do. Mann States that if you don't have equipment you can follow the beginners without the equipment or improvise with what you have at home.  If you don't have any of this equipment I found that the Camera Doesn't always point towards the beginner levels who are not using equipment and so at times you don't know what to do if your aren't using equipment.

4.  If I want to have a better workout at the Medium or Advanced Levels then I feel like I have to go out and spend the extra money on all this equipment just to get a higher impact work out. (You can't immitate using a stability Ball if you don't have one.) The advertising of this DVD did not say anything about all the equipment so I was surprised to see the variety of equipment used in the DVD and to find out how often it is used in the series.  It could have something to do with the Fact that She is a Sears Spokes Person for their Equipment Line.  Regardless, I believe a person winds up spending a whole lot more money buying equipment than they planned on spending.  And I can't really utilize the series effectively unless I have the Equipment.  So I got more than I barginned for.  For me, its more expense and hassle than it is worth.

I like the DVD Concept, but for the above reasons, I did not find this to be the best workout video series.",1098576000,24,3902,4.2516914749661705
