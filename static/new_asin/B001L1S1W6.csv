3677310,5,B001L1S1W6,I'm sad to say that i only found out about this show due to the fact that lifetime is now playing reruns of it. I loved what shows i saw so i decided to buy the seasons on dvd. The new adventures of old Christine is hilarious. I really wish the network that ran the show would have advertised a lot more and then maybe it wouldn't have been canceled. I would recommend this comedy to anyone who loves to laugh. I'm anxiously waiting for seasons 4 and 5 to come out on dvd!,1291248000,,472,4.031914893617022

Sadly only 10 episodes in series due to scriptwriters strike so perhaps not best value for money at full price.",1290556800,13,172,5.142857142857143

I will be searching for better prices (pssst...the WBstore has it for $10 less).  Why not bundle seasons 3 & 4 and leave the final season of Christine to stand alone (it wasn't as good anyway)  Still I wish the show hadn't been canceled, because Eric McCormack was awesome.",1284768000,2,373,4.3768115942028984

But they don't have subtitles, or closed captioned.
And the presentation is pretty cheap (I don't care about this that much)
But reality is I want to watch this show with non english speakers or hearing impaired, and now I own it on DVD but I HAVE to watch it by myself, and if I want to share it I have to watch it on TV with subtitles, that's just stupid.
If you are going to sell me DVDs like this, (with nothing) make them cheaper paying 90+ bucks for the last 3 seasons is just way to expensive, the first two seasons are cheaper, presentation is better and have everything a DVD needs.
Great show, cheap treatment to it.",1369958400,5,751,4.1506849315068495

3677461,2,B001L1S1W6,"The New Adventures of Old Christine's Season 3 deserves 5-stars, but I gave it two because of so few episodes.
Two DVD's, 10 episodes. Regular price, 34.99, on sale 24.99.
What I'd like to know is the actual cost in the making of a DVD.

Season 3's episodes are well-written, well-acted and hilarious.

I love Julia-Louis Dreyfus. She's one of the funniest comedians of the 21st century. A newer version of Lucille Ball.
The remaining cast members are excellent actors, too.

Each character does a fantastic job, well-suited to their roles, in a family-type atmosphere.

I recommend buying Season 3 especially if you're a die-hard Julia/Elaine/Christine fan..
Prepare youself to watch the complete season at one sitting. Buy a smaller bag of popcorn. lol. Toni",1361750400,2,760,5.056

Julia Louis Dreyfus is one of he all-time funniest female comic actors
in the history of the medium. She shines beyond Seinfeld here.

A couple of misguided customers gave this set a single star because
of technical problems they had with delivery/product and not the actual

your shipment was damaged, which has nothing to do with rating the show.",1337817600,,562,4.73469387755102

Was disapointed that this DVD was purchased from Amazon and it is a bootleg copy. The originals were copied onto an inferior disk therefore it clicked the whole time it was played. Was suspicious when I first opened it that it was not the same packaging from Season 1 and Season 2 that I have. The disk was even a pinkish color not like the siver ones of regular DVD's. It did not say original in the discription when I went back and checked but I thought Amazon only sold original copies. Shame on you Amazon! Buyer beware. The only good thing about this is that Amazon does have a great return policy. The bad thing is, I have to reorder with someone else and wait for my new copy.",1337731200,,787,4.324324324324325
