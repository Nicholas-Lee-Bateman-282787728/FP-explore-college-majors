And my father just told us to 'shut up' as he heard other people talk all day!  But I can relate to the audience.  A group of us in the early '70's used to hit an adult theater after work on Fridays in the 'Old Town' area of Chicago (at that time, the hip, happening area) , and do a loud interpretation ala Mystery Theater.  Soon we had several other groups doing the same thing.  The movies were lack luster, but the commentary got to be hilarious!",1466985600,,596,4.315315315315315

913563,5,6304612680,"This is the best of the genre of smart aleck movie critics which was first started in the NY TV market with Zacherly and later followed up by Vampirella and inumerable copycats.  What's magical about Joel Hodgson[MST3000] and company is that they make just the right comment when watching some god-awful black and white film.  The worse the film, the better.  Well, short of Ed Wood, this film was about the worst conceivable, a cautionary tale about permissive parents and what it leads to.  In particular, we see actors far too old to be the kids they portray misbehave in ways that, nowadays, noone would bat an eyelash.  And always, the parents substitute money(allowances) in the place of love.  I just wish I had had that type of parent.
The film is so absurd that it just begs for someone to 'smart off' and the MST3000 are the masters of the sarcastic aside.
For the MST3000 fan, or a newcomer, this is a must-have.",1406246400,2,923,4.597560975609756
913564,5,6304612680,"Just about all of the MST3K films are fun and this one does not disappoint.  From the early years when Joel Hodgson was aboard.  The movie itself is an obscure 40s film about a teenager that goes down the wrong road and ends up in court accusing his parents about the choices he himself made.  The short, which is always welcome, is about farming.  The subject matter is hardly important.  No matter what Joel and the 'bots riff, they make hilarious and enjoyable.  I bought a used copy of the Rhino DVD release via Amazon and it is in excellent condition.  Highly recommended.",1390176000,,577,4.543689320388349
913565,5,6304612680,"I will underscore two important points that many of these commenters have echoed in their review.  1)  If you are first being introduced to Mystery Science Theatre 3000, this is definitely one episode upon which to break the bottle of champagne.  It provides just the right kind of pre-viewing antics from Joel and the Robots, and once into the movie, 2) the lines just keep coming, and coming, and coming.  You will not be given much time to laugh at one comment before another hits you almost instantaneously.

It would be one thing if these lacerating remarks were all improv, but just ponder this:  the staff behind MST 3000 (Joel Hodgson in lead) work tirelessly--probably viewing the film countless times and then more--just to perfect the right discourse for Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo to heckle this 1945 B/W doozey.  The result is comic genius.  Site gags (QUACK! QUACK!), cracks on Kitty's 40s big blonde dollop (""I accuse her hair!!) , and yesthat universe of jokes on Jimmy's winning the Essay Contest and nobody giving a damn about it.

I own the VHS of this gem and played it to family and lots of fans in the VCR days.  I am now older (and not much wiser, I'll add), and in need of purchasing the DVD, because my family, who thrives on quality humor, demands that we include this film along with ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" and ""A Christmas Story"" as mandatory Holiday viewing.

With that last statement alone, I cannot come up with a better tribute/accolades/complement to MST 3000's ""I Accuse My Parents.""  Trust the masses and go with this film, laughing all the way.  Your stomach will hurt, but you'll thank all of us for it.",1387152000,,1656,4.708333333333333
913566,1,6304612680,"I'm watching it now on Netflix and was checking reviews wondering if I'm missing something about why a show that is known for showing horror and sci-fi b-movies is showing a dramatic movie about a young man and his dysfunctional family. This is so boring. They try desperately to make funny comments throughout the film, but the movie needs to be goofy in order for that to work.

913567,5,6304612680,"Space Mutiny used to be my favorite MST3K, but I think this has top honors now.

The total package is helped along by what is somewhat of a good movie in a 40s/50s sort of way.  It's a preachy story about a geeky ""good kid"" who goes astray due to neglectful alcoholic (but well-dressed) parents.  The ""kid"" seems to be in his mid-30's and has to range everywhere from a brown-nosing high school dork -- to a fawning lovestruck boy -- to an armed robber.  Strange but entertaining.  The hottie he's stuck on does a little music number that sticks in your head.  With the assistance of MST3K, this one was fun and I will revisit it.",1189900800,3,640,4.372881355932203

913615,5,6304612680,"In my humble opinion this is the best episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 in that show's long history. The original cast and writers are at the peak of their powers with this one, taking an otherwise gray documentary on ""Truck Farming"" and an equally gray, otherwise forgettable 1940s feature (I Accuse My Parents) and turning it into comedy gold. If fans (MSTies)want to introduce news fans to this hilarious show, this is the episode to show them. From the mad scientists ""Cake and Shake"" invention (""A real exotic dancer inside!"") to the snappy riffs of the short (""In Texas there's a further problem..."" ""Texans!"")to the hilarious host segments (particularly the biting analysis of the mind of the film's protagonist. ""You know, Joel, it could be that Jimmy's just really stupid"") to the rapid-fire riffing of the main film (""I won the ""Get the crap kicked out of you"" contest!""), this episode is non-stop laughs that even non-fans of the show should enjoy. MST3K was one of the funniest shows in televison history, and this was its epitome.",1162512000,4,1049,4.898876404494382
913616,5,6304612680,"I like to think of I Accuse My Parents as the perfect gateway MST3K episode.  Not only is the movie laughably moronic in several different ways--without being as mind numbingly boring as Manos, the Hands of Fate--it's proceeded by an awesome short about truck farming and the host segments are all pretty funny as well. My sister and I got my mother to drink the cool-aid with this one, and it was made better because she was pretty sure she'd actually seen the truck farming short in school.  I also indoctrinated my girlfriend with it and now it's become one of her favorites.

Yes, this is a Joel episode, but it's Joel at his best.  If you don't come out of watching this with at least three or four new catch phrases added to your vocabulary, there is no hope for you at all.  You should probably blame your parents for that.",1159228800,4,830,4.434210526315789
913617,5,6304612680,"Of the single-disc releases, this is my favorite by far, and here's why.  Sure, the MST3K stuff (bots, invention exchange, etc) is fine as usual, and the movie itself is not so bad (less gag-inducing than average, actually), and the commentary is witty and sharp as always.  The real can't miss feature of this disc is the short film, Truck Farming, a documentary look at the gritty life of early industrial farming.  The narration is beautifully upbeat, a curious contrast to the apparently depression-era (or close-following) images of workers, machinery, deforestation, and of course the vegetables, all the glorious fresh vegetables.  Don't miss it!",1152144000,2,653,5.25
913618,4,6304612680,"For an individual episode (with no extras), this DVD is overpriced at $18+.  It's certainly a good episode and it's worth getting if you can find it used or discount.  I got mine for just under $10 during an Amazon.com sale, which seems about right.

Otherwise I'd recommend one of the collected sets (four DVDs), which are better value for money, especially if you get them used.  Of course, this episode isn't in any collected sets (yet), so if you liked this episode in particular, you've no choice.",1150588800,,502,4.670454545454546

913620,4,6304612680,"Poor Jimmy -- he's having a birthday that Molly Ringwald would have swapped for in ""16 candles.""  His folks are clueless and/or drunk, he has no friends, and the dreamboat he meets while on his low-rent shoe-store gig is a mobster's sweetie.  Merriment ensues.

The saving grace is wonderful Al Frazier, who offers Jimmy a crash pad in back of his own house (""T'aint much,"") and enough hamburger ""sammiches"" to restore his self-esteem.  Whatever else happens between them is not mentioned (overtly, at least!)

The real payoff is the revelation that this film was shown to troops overseas during WWII -- no wonder the war took years to win!

As a previous review mentioned, this a classic MST episode, useful for introducing your friends to the genre (as opposed to, say, ""Wild World of Batwoman"", which could get you tossed out -- deservedly so!)

This one of the Joel films, where the criticism was aimed at the plot and characters, less at the actors themselves (a la ""Mitchell."")  One of the funniest interstitial bits is Joel trying to psychoanalyze the 'bots by having them draw pictures of their ideal families...dark, but sidesplitting.  Highly recommended!

Good trivia game: Everyone gives Jimmy money instead of affection -- how much has he pocketed by the last reel?",1135123200,5,1278,4.929906542056075
913660,5,6304612680,"Omigod, glory be to Amazon.com for selling this episode ... this was me and my sister's FAVORITE episode of all time ... the short has some of the BEST quips that STILL make me laugh to this day ...

From the short on truck farming -

Narration: ""Some carrots are harvested.""

Servo: ""Some carrots are humiliated publicly.""

(Showing a scene of Mexican workers)

""These select few are being paid 3 cents a day""

From I ACCUSE MY PARENTS:

""It's my birthday!""

""Hi, it's essay boy!  Essay's the name!""

""She's drunk -- It's funny!""

""I accuse her HAIR.""

And of course the classic song -

""Are you happy ... ""

Oh, jeez.  Only MST is the kind of show you can watch one evening with your sister and its so funny that you're still laughing out loud at the very thought of it 7 years later.  I just found my sister's birthday present.",1111104000,9,830,4.3618421052631575
913661,5,6304612680,"This DVD from Rhino offers up one the funniest -- and most charming -- episodes of the legendary TV show ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" where they take on a 1944 drama/gangster movie/message flick called, ""I Accuse My Parents."" There are few episodes of the show I recommended higher for all-around quality.
For those of you unfamiliar with ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" (MST3K for short) it is a ninety-minute show featuring a silhouette of a man and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) in movie theater seats projected in front of a bad movie. The hosts provide hysterical, satiric, and culturally-savvy wisecracks to accompany the movie. The episodes also includes sketches and songs and adds up to some of the most hilarious comedy you will ever see.
""I Accuse My Parents"" is episode #507, from the last days of Joel Hodgson's run as host. Although the movie itself is actually not that bad, this episode comes at point in the show's development when the writers and performers were at the peak of the powers, and the result is one of the most hilarious episodes, and one that really grows on you with its sense of warm parody. It's a good episode for newcomers as well, since the film is average enough so that its awfulness doesn't distract from the wisecracks. (I've noticed that when I show an episode of the show to a friend who has never seen it before, the worse the movie being parodied is, the more my friend focuses on the movie instead of the hosts. This, therefore, is a good ""training"" episode.)
The camaraderie between the cast is quite wonderful here, and the warm, jocular style of the Joel years is at its strongest. After Mike Nelson took over as host (a few episodes later), the comedy style became more satiric and antagonistic toward the film. I love both hosts, but there is something rather magical and pleasant about the comedy of Joel's stint as host, and this episode displays that style perfectly. It is one of quintessential Joel Hodgson episodes.
The movie is a competently shot `B' programmer from low-budget studio PRC. Our hero is Jimmy, a really stupid high school graduate who has to get a job at a shoe store despite his skills at essay writing (he won an essay content and mentions it endlessly). While lying to impress a girl, Jimmy idiotically ends up getting into debt and having to go to work as a courier for a gangster, while he also romances the gangster's girl Kitty (played by actress Mary Beth Hughes, who also appears in another MST3K episode, ""Last of the Wild Horses."") Well, pretty soon our poor fool is in trouble with the law and the mob and on the run. And when it all explodes in his face, whom does he accuse? Yep, the title gives it away: His Parents! And why? Because they drink and argue. See, it's all their fault.
What makes this episode so dang funny is not that the film is particularly rotten looking or the acting is awful, but because the film's premise and main character are so stupid. The hosts lance into the characters at every point: Jimmy's incessant lying (""I liberated France while you were out dancing""), Jimmy's constant bragging about winning an essay constant (""Welcome to the Annual Essay Awards Ceremony!"") his alcoholic parents who keep throwing money at him (""I'm up here with the D.T.s, honey! Would you get the yellow lizard out of the bathroom?""), Jimmy's rank stupidity (""Sir, I just don't get the holy spirit. Is it a bird?""), and the extremely obvious gangster organization (""Organized crime, please hold...organized crime, please hold...). This is a very `character'-driven episode, and it's hilarious. There's also some great sketches between movie watching. In one sketch, Joel and the Robots psychoanalyze Jimmy to show that more than just `drunk folks' are behind his problems. (Crow, or course, determines that Jimmy is just stupid.)
This DVD is a laugh riot, and a quintessential Joel episode. It feels like plunking down on the couch and watching a film with your best buddies; I think that's the main charm of the Joel years of the show. Newcomers and old fans alike will want this classic. (There are absolutely no extras on the DVD, however, but the episode is such a gem, it doesn't matter.)",1079049600,48,4203,4.751025991792066
913662,4,6304612680,"Sometimes I think the greatest contribution ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" made to society was reintroducing hundreds of terrible movies that most people would never have watched again and warned us all how not to tell a story. Case in point -- ""I Accuse My Parents."" A young man, ignored by his parents, falls into a life of crime by becoming a courier for a mobster, is blissfully stupid enough not to NOTICE he has become a courier for a mobster, falls for the mobster's girlfriend and then lays the whole thing at his parents' feet when he winds up in court. And all this from a kid who actually won an essay contest.
The movie, naturally, was meant to preach a point about parental responsibility, and does it in such a heavy-handed, ""beating you over the head"" sort of way that even the title seems like a sermon. Thank Heavens for Joel and the 'bots. As always, they tear this terrible flick apart with their usual wit, savvy and sheer zaniness. From a hysterical spoof of the nightclub scene in the movie to the fastest one-liners (""Do you think he'd ever accuse us?""), they make yet another turkey bearable.
As with most MST3K solo DVDs, this one is pretty sparce in the special features department. On the other hand, what is there to really add to something like this? Sure, it'll most likely appeal to fans of the show only, but if you're not a fan of the show, you don't know what you're missing anyway.",1073865600,6,1416,4.53515625
913663,5,6304612680,"A Classic MST3K right from the start!

Until Joel and Crow pop his balloon by reminding him that he has no legs and his arm's don't work!
The short, ""Truck Farming"" reminds us how greatful the Mexicans are to come across the border to harvest our delicios carrots so young white people up North can receive their proper nutrition in winter!  Plenty of 'bot cannon fodder here!  It gives plenty of incentive for children to bend and stoop for a living!
The main movie is an example of Doctor Spock psychoanalysis, but set in the World War 11 generation, and they even attempted to make it a musical!  Sure, the father is wooden and the mother is a Honky Tonk lush, but the son's problems do not rise out of that, they rise out of his constant LYING, LYING, LYING! and sheer stupidity!  As the ""mobile"" skit by Joel and the bots exemplify, all his excuses are tiny little things to that huge ""STUPID"" floating mobile that always interferes and blocks the view of the others!
THe bots do an excellent job in trashing all the stupid songs we have to endure in this stinkburger, and this movie envites all the commentary that can be vomited on it!

The episode starts with ""The Truck Farmer"", a short film claiming that Mexican farm laborers enjoy helping agro-business harvest their carrot crops.  It looks and sounds so nice that you almost expect the 11-year-old farm worker to look at the camera and beam a beautiful smile.  Crow remarks, ""Her beauty will soon fade"".  It's surreal and depressing.  And, as has been pointed out, there is not a truck to be seen in this piece of blatant agro-propaganda.
""I Accuse My Parents"" is about Jimmy, the world's most dense up-and-coming shoe salesman.  Obsessed with his essay and his birthday, he falls for Kitty (""Meow), the moll of a local hood.  Jimmy starts doing the hood helpful favors, such as carrying packages and the like. Meanwhile, Jimmy's mom and dad are drunks who think essays and birthdays are less important than partying in beach houses.  One thing leads to another, and...I'll let the rest be a surprise.  Oh yeah, and Jimmy's mom shows up at school drunk and scandalizes the local association of prudish schoolmarms.
Jimmy is ultimately framed, and is taken in by a kindly old short order cook with an obsession for hamburgers and ushering.  After his arrest, Jimmy endurse a lecture by a 1940s Judge while his parents look on aghast.

The ""Truck Farmer"" short is bleak and hilarious... from its ridiculous portrayal of pioneers heading west, to its non-PC depiction of farm workers, to the fact that there is not one truck in the entire thing.  ""Some farmers like to plow to Igor Stravinsky!""  Thanks, Crow, for the belly-laugh!
The feature is a new high/low in the non-SciFi genre... a morality tale for the Eisenhower era.  Jimmy is a product of growing up in an 80-proof household... his parents swill the stuff like water.  Jimmy's mother: this chick is off the chain.  The ""swinger"" allusions are a riot... but it's like the Cleavers live next door...  kinky!
The scene where Jimmy sells Kitty shoes is priceless.  Likewise, Kitty's horendous vocal numbers are  brilliantly skewered by Joel and the 'Bots; you will be laughing so hard that you will have to watch them multiple times to catch everything.  A supporting cast to die for, as well.
When is Rhino just going to bite the bullet, pay the marginal copyright fees, and put this whole series out on DVD?  THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE and WEREWOLF need to see digital glory.",1062633600,4,1162,4.698019801980198
913668,4,6304612680,"I really liked the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode featuring the film ""I Accuse My Parents"". The film revolves around Jimmy who tends to lie to any and everyone about his dysfunctional homelife. His mother is an alcoholic and his father is a gambler and adulter. Jimmy then meets a beautiful woman named Kitty and instantly falls in love with her. Unfortunately, Kitty is involved with a mobster, and the story just snowballs from there.
The commentary from Joel, Tom Servo, and Crow is really funny and you can't help but add some of your own comments to this crazy movie.
As an added bonus, you also get to watch the short, ""The Truck Farmer"" which basically talks about farming in the South during the winter - they made sure to show every unpaid worker they could.

913669,5,6304612680,"OK, this story's about Jimmy.  At the start he seems to be a nice, smart, well-liked kid, who, for someone who looks like he's in his twenties, does real well in high school.  But, as it turns out, Jimmy also has a real knack for lying and doing shady errands for his girlfriend's (Kitty) other boyfriend (mobster Charlie).  And the whole reason he resorts to this life of crime is because his parents have a bigger interest in spending time at Jack Taylor's house with their good friend Jim Beam instead of spending time with Jimmy.

This episode is one of my favorites.  Joel and the 'bots are so ""on"", that even Kitty's songs, which when seen in their original state would be mind-numbingly unbearable, are hilarious enough to rewind and watch again before continuing with the rest of the show.  The movie provides so much material to lampoon that the time just flies by while watching it.  And just when you think it may be slowing down and getting a little dull, the character (and what a character!) of Al Frazier comes along to give the guys enough ammo to easily fill the last 20 minutes of the movie.

My experience has been that it's best to start newbies out with Mitchell, but when I'm not sure what I want to watch I always turn to I Accuse My Parents.  And it provides a great alternative stress reliever.  Did you burn tonight's dinner, lose your job, or get your hand slammed in a door?  Forget swearing, just accuse your parents!

I think they might like to check the credits as to who the head writer is for this episode. You guessed it, Mike Nelson. Maybe I'm not enough of a sci-fi geek for some fans, but I seem to enjoy these types of movies being ridiculed over the usual sci-fi fare. The 'truck farming' short aside (not my favorite short but when the jokes run from the Donner party to carrot-top, what's not to like?) the robot skits are some of the funniest ever and the movie itself produces some funny, funny comments.

913684,4,6304612680,"Episode 507, I Accuse My Parents, is a great example of the preachy melodramas that the MST3K gang ripped into gleefully before they moved to that other network that would not let the guys stray too far from science fiction movies.  I would not call this a classic episode, but its certainly very entertaining.  Jim is a goofy kid who blames all of his problems on his parents.  Sure, his mom is a lush and his father is a cold fish also known to slosh around in the bottom of the bowl, but the kid seems to have a good head on his shouldersat first.  Unfortunately, Jims first place finish in an action-packed school essay contest seems to be the peak of his intellectual career.  When his teachers want to meet the mother who inspired such a baseball and apple pie essay in praise of family life, Jims thrilling victory is turned into deep shame when his mother stumbles in to the meeting as drunk as a fish.  Only now do Jims emotional problems (and stupidity) begin to come out into the open.  Having lied about his family life for years, he begins to lie about basically everything.  After managing to start a career in the lucrative shoe sales business, he meets up with a night club singer named Kitty.  Soon he is lying to her about his family and throwing money around trying to impress her.  Having no money to start with, he starts running odd jobs for Kittys shady boss (who also happens to love Kitty).  Too stupid to realize what he is doing, Jim finds himself smack dab in a life of crime.  After making countless stupid mistakes, he justifies everything by accusing his parents.  Yes, it is all the fault of the parents who gave him everything he wanted but didn't love him enoughhow can he be blamed for doing odd jobs for his Mafia boss and lying like Rip Van Winkle in the mountains and pretending to be a big shot in front of his girlfriend?
This movie is just a morality play.  Ostensibly aimed at parents, its message is actually one of lying and passing the buck for troubled youths.  It actually features three musical numbers, which Joel and the guys manage to pull us through with their typical acerbic comments.  Melodramas like this just begged to be riffed, and the gang steps right up to the plate and knocks out a few extra base hits with this one.  They also manage to make a horribly boring short, The Truck Farmer, bearable.  The quality of the skits is also pretty high this time around.  One of them features the infamous Tom Servo nude scene, while another gem has Joel and the Bots performing one of the snappy musical numbers from the movie.  This video ranks above average on the old laugh meter and should definitely be a part of any MST fans collection.",1036972800,8,2695,4.47239263803681

When I was looking for new episodes to buy and came across this one, the reviews made ""I Accuse My Parents"" sound like the most amazing DVD in the world. It wasn't. I did, do, and always will like Mike better than Joel. This episode (wih Joel) was a huge dissappointment after reading all the fantastic reviews.
The movie is about a kid who's on trial for something...murder or robbery or drug smuggling...and he blames his neglectful and adulterous parents for causig him to go to the dark side. The movie was tedious, the comments weren't all that funny, and I found myself wishing I had spent the money on blank videos to tape the episodes with Mike on the Sci-Fi channel.

The film was bad, which was expected, but the comments from Joel, Crow, and Tom were not as amusing as I would've liked them to be. In fact, there were several times when I came up with a comment about a scene in ""I Accuse my Parents"" that was far funnier than anything they said. I didn't even watch the whole movie at once, which I usually do as a Mistie, because it was so un-humorous and the movie was so boring that I found more interesting things to do. I kept wishing that it would get funnier and it never did.
  If you want a good MST3K episode, buy ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" which stars Mike Nelson instead of Joel and is very funny. Joel is mediocre at best in comparison to Mike.",1027987200,4,821,4.189873417721519
913687,5,6304612680,"This was the first Joel episode I watched and I thought I was going to have a stroke I was laughing so hard (or maybe it was because I smelt toast. I'm not sure). The short about truck farming is dark, and not even Joel or the 'bots can really save it. As it is, a lot of the farmer jokes fall a little flat (and yes I get them. I am from Nebraska). As it is, the segments also are not anything to write home about. Although the one where Joel tries to analyze the 'bots psyches is probably the best, in my opinion, segment.
However, the movie is pure gold. It's a 1940's morality play created to get parents to realize that they can't just go out and party day and night and ignore their stupid 20 year old kids. Jimmy is so slow that he gains mob ties without trying to, and goes on the lam just long enough to decide he has to come back. Add this and the songs that Jimmy's love interest belts out and it really is no wonder the MST3K team made this into a great episode.
I recommend it highly and think that every MiSTie should see it, but not over the great eps like ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" or ""Mitchell.""

A drunk mom and womanizing dad lead our poor hero to a life of petty crime. Poor guy. This film is just bearable enough to actually watch and Joel and ""the bots"" do a great job smacking it.

In fact, if our hero--young, stupid, lying Jimmy--were here right now, he'd probably tell us that his swell mom bought ol' Mitchell his very first 6-pack of Coors.
Yep, the main guy, high-school aged Jimmy tells the biggest whoppers he can think of so people will think he has the perfect home life.  Unfortunately, Mom's a lush, and Dad's a deadbeat.  But that doesn't keep Jimmy from winning the school essay contest.  This provides Joel and the 'bots some of the sharpest one-liners they've ever had.  Now, everywhere Jimmy goes, one of the 'bots'll shout something like, ""Hey everybody, I won the essay contest.  Yep, that's me...Mr. Essay!""  That'll be plenty to land Jimmy the coveted job of shoe salesmen, where his first (or only) customer will be future-Jimmy's girl, Miss Kitty -- the swellest dame Jimmy's ever seen (except of course for ol' top-poppin' Mom).
Enter: Jimmy's girl.  Slim, blonde, attractive (at least to Jimmy anyway), mob ties, happy in her work, and naive enough to believe anything Jimmy tells her.  In one scene, Crow speaks for Jimmy: ""...So my Mom says to Roosevelt and Churchill, 'How 'bout a Lend-Lease Program?'""  Jimmy meets Kitty when she comes in to buy a pair of shoes.  When Jimmy looks at the foot-measure, Joel says, ""It says here, your feet don't exist.""

The basic plot of this one (after a rather ridiculous look at the exploitative world of truck farming in the opening short feature) is more coherent than most MST films, but no better, really.  Jimmy is a good middle-aged high school student and essay writer (""Essay man here!"") who is becoming depressed because his parents give him lots of money and let him drink (huh?).  Anyway, after meeting a 30 year-old teenaged girl night-club singer and spending all of his shoesalesman salary on her, he gets mixed up in the world of organized crime with the girl's 50 year old boyfriend, Blake.  Blake gets Jimmy involved in a botched robbery, and Jimmy threatens to squeal on him after being consoled by a tubby little line cook at a diner.  Jimmy and Blake then get into a rather femmy fight and Jimmy shoots and kills Blake.  The preachy judge lets Jimmy off scot-free but his parents get a stern lecture.
Joel and the Bots really give ole Jimmy a good ribbing (deservedly) for being such a knucklehead throughout this movie, despite his award-wining-essay-caliber intelligence.  He really is quite a dope.  In one particular host segment they try to figure out what exactly is wrong with Jimmy by making a mobile of his psyche.  As it turns out, there are many factors, but the main one that is that he's stupid.
Overall, I'd say this is one of the stronger Joel episodes (I, personally, prefer the Mike years), with non-stop laughs and good host segments.  I highly recommend it.",1023753600,6,1685,4.739726027397261
913722,5,6304612680,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 has always been one of my favorite TV series.  Even in later years, when the non-movie material (the short subjects and invention exchange) faded away, the movies themselves were always a hoot.  Although usually focusing on cheesy science fiction and horror movies, this episode shows that any sort of bad movie serves as prime fodder for the MST3K crew.
The main feature (following a short on truck farming that features no trucks) is a cautionary tale about bad parenting.  When their accusing son can't find love at home, he takes up with a nightclub singer with a heart of gold and a mobster boyfriend.  Through events that are more a result of naivete (despite winning an essay contest, he is not overly bright), he eventually winds up on the run and taken in by a kindly restaurant owner.  In the end, however, all works out, and his parents, accused by their son and lectured to by a judge, are fated to turn their hedonistic lives around.
Since this is MST3K, the movie's story is purely incidental, and only an excuse to make jokes.  The one-liners fly by quickly, and even if some miss, there are always a dozen more that hit.  As an opportunity to squeeze a little bit of virtue out of a really bad movie, this is a success.",1023408000,8,1264,4.591111111111111
913723,4,6304612680,"Unlike other episodes of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000, the movie featured here actually does have a coherent storyline.  That sentence out of the way, you will not hear me say anything else positive about the film.  The plot may be vaguely coherent, but relies on stupid people stupidly doing stupid things for no stupid reason other than to further the stupid plot.  Just when you think the film can't take its simplistic premise any farther, the judge actually turns directly to the camera and tells everyone what the moral of the story is.  Painful, painful, painful.  Fortunately, the MST3k crew is right there with us to point out the films more glaring mistakes and to mock the characters in their every move.
Wow, what a bizarre piece of work this film is.  Apparently some smart writer thought it would be great to build a film around the premise that most of society's ills can be placed directly at the feet of drunken idiotic parenting.  Yes, it's bad parenting that drives ordinary award-winning essay-writers into being hapless stooges for the mob.  The fact that the plot requires the main character (a ""teenager"" played by someone obviously in their mid to late twenties) to perform a fairly long series of tasks without realizing what he's doing apparently escapes the attention of the storyline.  It also escapes the attention of the film that their hero is a complete dope.  So one finds it difficult to blame his parents for his dubious actions when the audience repeatedly sees the protagonist doing one dumb thing after another.  Perhaps if his defense had been that his parents had dropped him on his head as a youngster too many times I would have felt more sympathy for him.
This episode also features the short film TRUCK FARMING.  It does not feature any trucks.  You figure it out; I couldn't.
The moral of this episode is that sometimes movies aren't born bad, but become bad due to lack of attention when developing and through poor parenting.  Remember that.",1020124800,,1988,4.8088235294117645

Vonnegut gently admonished the work of Best Brains, saying that many of these 'b' movies were put out by struggling writers pounding out movie scripts overnight.  It is my feeling that 'I Accuse My Parents' most likely falls into this category.
I also find it interesting just how many of these 'juvenile delinquency' films emerged at or about that time period in American history-and MST3K documents it quite well. The Brains' catalogue of films that dealt with the delinquency genre included 'Untamed Youth', 'Teenage Strangler', 'Teen-age Crime Wave', 'Girls Town', 'The Violent Years', 'Kitten With a Whip', and 'High School Big Shot'.  The post-World War II era seems to have been a time when our nation rose as one with the question 'What are we doing wrong-how are we failing these kids?'
It goes to show, I suppose, that films like 'Rebel Without a Cause' proved to be the exception rather than the rule in exploring the issue of juvenile delinquency.  The failing of 'I Accuse My Parents' lies in its cliched approach to the subject matter.  'Young' Jimmy Wilson's parents are neglectful alcoholics, but they are simply not believable.  Alcoholism and neglect wear far more frightening masks than were portrayed-as is all too well known.  Likewise, the 'mob' that Jimmy inadvertently joins is involved in errands so shadowy as to be completely obscured.
We can blame, I suppose, the zeal of the Hayes Commission for the 'cleanup' job done on this farce of a movie about a very real problem. In the same instance though, we collectively share the guilt for this movie's badness, because it's utter failure to investigate a social issue was rooted in our inability to be honest with ourselves.

Everything about this episode works so well, and is so consistently funny that it will make you want to watch it again and again to catch all the riffs that you missed the first time when you were laughing to hard.  Everything from Joel psychoanalyzing his robots, to the constant riffs (I won the essay contest!)

His neglecting alcoholic parents know nothing  because they're off to the beach with their friends!  It's like a  light-hearted Blue Velvet!  With material like that, you know Joel and the  bots are going to make mince meat out of it.  Plus, there's never been a  bad short - ""Bow down before the truck farmer!""

7875987,5,6304612680,"This was my first purchase of an MST3K in DVD form after seeing the original broadcast on Comedy Central back in the Nineties, and it's still a favorite.  I hold up I ACCUSE MY PARENTS as proof that a deep-dish mediocrity like this one provides better gold for Joel and the bots than a recognized stinker like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  Although released in 1944, I ACCUSE betrays no evidence that there was A War On but tries to mine practically every other popular movie genre:  an expose of social alcoholism, a juvenile flick, a gangster movie (including the inevitable climactic courtroom scene), even a semi-musical with nightclub numbers by Livingston and Evans who would give us much better songs later on, hits like ""Buttons and Bows"" and that all-purpose Fifties trope, ""Que Sera, Sera.""  In other words, there's a distinct lack of talent on both sides of the camera which the movie's producers apparently tried to remedy by switching genres every fifteen minutes.

Young Jimmy's mom is deep into her cups and her party-hearty husband isn't much better off, either.  When Jimmy, apparently a high-school senior, wins his school's coveted ""Essay Contest,"" Mom insists on showing up at school, in the morning, blotto as usual.  ""Shocking!"" exclaims a matronly English teacher; ""Eleanor Roosevelt's pissed!"" cries Joel.  Apparently Jimmy is so embarrassed by his non-parental parents that he drops out of school, takes a menial job in a shoe store, makes the acquaintance of a girl trying to make it as a nightclub entertainer, and through her makes the acquaintance of the local gangster who soon has the hapless Jimmy delivering mysterious packages about town at all hours.  Jimmy then flees his home town (Travel Montage!) and makes the acquaintance of an equally slow-witted gent who runs a hamburger shack and offers Jimmy safe harbor.

Joel and the bots are in their element on this one:  references to the ""Essay Contest"" and shoes turn up throughout the movie at the most unexpected and hilarious times.  Mediocre production values, flat acting, insipid characterizations and forgettable songs all get their due.  The MST3K gang satirize one of the songs with ""Gypsy"" the seldom-seen robot playing the lead singer.  This feature is preceded by a butt-kissing short about the benefits of agribusiness called ""The Truck Farmer.""  This disc is definitely worth seeing, although these days finding a download may be economically preferable to locating a used DVD -- you sure aren't getting mine!
