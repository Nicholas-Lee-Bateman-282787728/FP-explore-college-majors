7132013,5,B00WFN0Y4W,"Poltergeist: The Legacy is one of my favorite sci-fi shows and for years fans have been begging for seasons 1-4 to be on a dvd collection! Only season one was officially released on DVD and then Amazon released season two created on DVR. Now is the time to stop playing around, give fans what they truly want by making the entire seasons available on all formats/regions!",1454803200,10,371,4.636363636363637

I have been a fan of the show since its inception, and have been waiting with bated breath for the last two seasons to be released on DVD. And I can guarantee that there are hundreds, if not thousands of others who have been waiting right along with me.

7132046,5,B00WFN0Y4W,"Very good show great to have it again. It came with a defective disc but a new disc was sent and arrived about a week later so all around good service.
The show was kind of a mix between supernatural and warehouse 13. The characters were great although some of the later ones were kind of hit or miss when Syfy took over and put in The Undertaker as a evil spirit to sell the show more. All in all very worth the price glad to finally have it since I have been waiting on a full collection for quite a while. the CGI is a little dated but what do you expect from a show back in the 90s.",1518307200,2,586,3.8916666666666666
7132047,3,B00WFN0Y4W,"I gave only three stars because I don't like these kind of cases where each discs don't have own holder. The case feels and looks strong/heavy but the discs inside the box are piled in one pile... at least discs are in seperate paper packs. Still some of the discs has some kinds of ""scrats""(?) on them. I tested quickly 1-2 episodes from all diskets. S3 disc 3 had some problems, had to skip to next chapter of the episode. Hopefully this was the only episode with probles.

Great horror series, product quality not so much...  :/",1516752000,5,531,4.463917525773196

7132052,3,B00WFN0Y4W,"I am giving this 3 stars because the quality of the reproduction is not so great (not because I dislike the series). The company that boxed the series into a complete collection simply scaled the video to full screen, thereby reducing the quality.  So that is a great disappointment - but I will say that when you play the disc, there is a warning before the top menu that warns that the quality is not the greatest.

I just wish they had mentioned this in the description of the product.

I love this series, so was excited to get the complete series because it was difficult (and expensive) to buy each season separately. So was disappointed that quality was not so great - but then again you get what you pay for.",1510012800,10,716,4.409090909090909

7132056,5,B00WFN0Y4W,"Absolutely delighted with product.  I watched this series in the late 1990s and in reruns when it popped up from time to time.  When Seasons 1 and 2 came out, I waited for Seasons 3 and 4.  Patience, writing, and begging for the rest of the series to be produced has paid off.  The DVDs are in paper covers in a well made box.

7132060,4,B00WFN0Y4W,"I was very surprised to see the improvements made on this release of the series from the MOD MGM/UA DVDs sold some years ago.  The image has more detail and is more stable.  I admit the image was reformatted for 16 : 9 sets from its OAR but it doesn't seem blown up or distorted.  Even the sound is better.

Sadly, the order of the episodes is still out of whack.  I don't know if they are aligning more with production or even broadcast order.  This was a good deal and suggest all true fans of the show buy this set.  I'm in the middle of the second season so perhaps I speak too soon but if the level of quality maintains I will be pleased.

Now if unedited versions of the 90s Outer Limits would come to video that would be great.  I notice the 60s version is coming to Blu-ray.  Yeah!",1505606400,5,789,4.098039215686274

7132068,3,B00WFN0Y4W,"So far I have watched 4 episodes and the video quality has been good.  I am happy that the DVD's so far are not defective.  I am however disappointed in the packaging of the DVD's.  I would have spent more money to get the DVD's if I knew that the packaging was decent.  There are too many DVD's crammed into one large case.  Each season should have had its own case with one bigger case to hold all four seasons.  Another problem with the packaging is that the spindles that the DVD's are attached to are too deep.  The DVD's tend to stick to the spindles and you have to be careful when you pry them off of the spindles.  I went ahead and bought a DVD case to store the DVD's in, so that I will not ruin any of the DVD's when trying to pry them off of the spindles.  I think this is a good product with working DVD's, but the packaging is less than desirable.  If they plan on selling this product for a long time, I would suggest improving the packaging and charging another $10 to $15 dollars for the DVD set.",1502755200,5,1013,4.096446700507614
7132069,5,B00WFN0Y4W,Great to have the entire series------and in widescreen.  The price is pretty reasonable.  One might almost say cheap.  Sixteen discs for 50.00.  That's about three dollars a disc.  Grab it before it becomes OOP.,1502668800,,211,5.088235294117647
7132070,5,B00WFN0Y4W,"My favorite show finally made it to DVD in a complete series box set. Great show and the quality of the DVDs are excellent for a show that was made in the 90's and not in HD. The art work on the box itself as well as on the DVDs is top notch. Poltergeist The Legacy has the best cast, they work well together and a long with the story lines make a awesome show. I will recommend it to those who love horror and a great show in general. If you have never seen it, it is definitely worth the watch.",1502496000,5,496,3.872549019607843

Great show!  I own Seasons 1 & 2, both acquired from Amazon, S2 was kinda pricey!  I'd love to own this Complete Series, if the price ever comes down.  I really don't want to pay $50 for it although it's probably worth it.  Glad I own S1/2, maybe someday I'll own this!",1501286400,,408,4.233766233766234
7132076,5,B00WFN0Y4W,"Finally, one of my favourite shows has come to DVD all 4 seasons together for the first time ever. Living in the UK it costs a bit to import but it is so worth it when the quality is this good. All the episodes seem unedited which is great to see and the picture and sound quality are very good. Some really impressive episodes. This series did for the occult what the X Files did for UFO''s Helen Shaver and Robbi Chong stand out in an impressive ensemble and the effects are great for a show that is 20 years old",1501200000,,514,4.099009900990099
7132077,3,B00WFN0Y4W,"I've been waiting a long time for this and ideally, it should have warranted five stars Unfortunately, I must subtract stars for the abysmal packaging and the disorder of episodes in Season 1.

Was it really necessary to cram 16 disks into a case made for 12? Adding to the problems was a manufacturing error that made one available slot unusable (at least in my case). Luckily I was able to remove them all with only negligible damage to one of the disks (caused by the faulty slot) but now, instead of displaying a handsome case, they're stuffed into black envelopes. I would gladly have paid a couple of bucks more for decent packaging!

The fact that many Season 1 episodes (less so for Season 2) are out of order is hell on my Germanic sense of order ... what in the world was the reasoning behind that? Makes absolutely no sense.

On the bright side, I expected much-less-than-stellar picture quality with so many episodes per disk. Fortunately, that has turned out to be not really a major problem.",1500422400,7,1005,4.603351955307263
7132078,5,B00WFN0Y4W,"I don't usually write product reviews, but I felt it was worth letting other fans know about VEIs DVD release of the Showtime/SciFi Series, Poltergeist the Legacy from the late 1990s.

The quality of the video on the discs is excellent and the sound is very clear and sharp.  I have watched six episodes from seasons three and four and the show looks better than it did during its original broadcast run - and 100% better than the quality currently found on Comet TV, the shows current home.

Fans should be very happy that the entire show has finally been released after a wait of over seventeen years (the show ended in November of 1999), particularly as some of the best episodes were from the third season.  For those new to show who take a chance on it, watch the premiere episode from season one and then skip directly to these three episodes from the third season -  Darkness Falls, Light of Day, and Armies of the Night  as these will give you an overview on how well produced the show was despite its limited budget.  Other notable episodes include Ghost in the Road, The Tenement, The Signalman, and The Devils Lighthouse  just to name a few.  One great thing about the show was the cast and crew knew it was ending after the fourth season which allowed them the chance to bring the show to a proper conclusion.

Underrated at the time of its original broadcast, Poltergeist the Legacy is a show which deftly mixed horror with a touch of science fiction and fantasy.  The core cast  Derek de Lint, Helen Shaver, Robbi Chong, and Martin Cummins  all brought their talents to the table and made for a realistic group of paranormal investigators called The Legacy.

Kudos for VEI for getting the rights to release the show.  Watch this company as they are slowly but surely releasing some very rare television shows from the 1980s and 1990s  many of which fans thought would never be issued on DVD.

UPDATE 7/17 -  Many of the SEASON ONE episodes are in the wrong order of broadcast although all of them are included.  This happens with season two with ""The Devil's Lighthouse"" coming before ""Repentance"" - but it looks like other than those two episodes being reversed - the rest of this season - as well as all of season three and four are in the correct broadcast order.

Note:  The packaging is not a problem at all.  Although the discs are packed tightly according to each season, they are not that difficult to take out of the case.  However, use caution as you do not want to scratch the discs!",1499644800,11,2508,4.536748329621381

Robbie Chong's hair goes from long to short to long to short of you try to watch it straight through.
