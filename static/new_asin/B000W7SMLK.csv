While it's a fascinating DVD, and does show a number of routines, it wasn't what I wanted.  If you just want to view some good old soft shoe, it would be perfect!",1501113600,,252,4.229166666666667
8221570,5,B000W7SMLK,Sam Weber is such a precise teacher and beautiful dancer. His technique is impeccable and you get to see him improvise in his own style which is amazing! And it's wonderful to have the old film footage to Coles & Atkins doing their slow soft shoe. It's a collector's item as well as a perfect teaching tool. Thank you Sam.,1387238400,,322,4.383333333333334
