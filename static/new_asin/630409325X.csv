bits and pieces from these and my daughter loves it.",1010620800,,105,4.25
7861041,2,630409325X,"This was my first WeeSing video, and I will not be buying any others.  My 11 month old son usually loves anything with songs (Veggie Tales, Sesame Street, the Muppet Show, even that commercial for the Countdown Kids CD set), but he completely ignored this video, and I don't blame him.  The songs are short and the introductions are long.  Also, this appears to be a collection of bits from other episodes, put together in a way that seems very disjointed.  I find the adults dressed up as animals creepy, worse than the teletubbies.  I don't see how any adult can stand to be in the same room while this video plays.",985651200,11,617,4.473214285714286
