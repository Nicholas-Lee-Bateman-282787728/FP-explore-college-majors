7854543,2,6303871453,"Indie producer/writer/director James Glickenhaus made some fun B movies but this 1995 effort which was his last is definitely not one of them.  The almost completely incoherent story involves a boy named Jessie (the director's son Jesse-Cameron-Glickenhaus) time-traveling to different places to stop an evil game-master from another planet from killing his parents and causing the thermo-nuclear destruction of earth.

In theory the set-up allows Glickenhaus to play with action set-pieces from completely different genres--there's a western action scene as well as a Shaolin martial arts sequence and a James Bond style ski chase with machine guns--but since the action scenes represent game-play and we frequently can't tell who we're supposed to be rooting for none of it ends up being particularly exciting.

Some of the special effects are imaginative if cheap looking but the main point of interest with Timemaster at this point is that it features an early performance by a pre-Dawson's Creek Michelle Williams who looks to be around fourteen.  She was clearly a natural but the same can't be said for Jesse Cameron-Glickenhaus who frequently seems jarringly out of place opposite professional actors.  While he isn't as wooden as he was in Slaughter of the Innocents he still comes across as someone who only got the part because his dad made the movie.

Slaughter of the Innocents which I liked was basically Silence of the Lambs for kids--which is as weird as it sounds--but that film was anchored by a strong performance from Scott Glenn as Jessie's FBI agent father (Jesse Cameron-Glickenhaus was apparently such a bad actor he could only play characters named Jessie), a genuinely creepy villain and a plot that was well-constructed and easy to follow.  Timemaster eliminates most of the adult elements from Slaughter of the Innocents to make a more conventional kids film but the results are a confusing mess.  Timemaster is easily James Glickenhaus's least polished film since The Soldier in 1982.  Compared with The Protector (1985 starring Jackie Chan) and Shakedown (1988 starring Peter Weir) Timemaster is a depressing step backwards in terms of quality and a sad way to end a pretty good film-making career.",1420070400,,2228,5.218487394957983
7854544,1,6303871453,"After reading the plot synopsis on IMDB/Amazon and listening to the narration in the beginning of the movie, I can safely say that I have no idea what was going on in the movie. The story could have been interesting if done properly, but the script was horrible and the time-line jumped around more than a bunny rabbit.

Only watch this movie if you enjoy torturing your brain or feeling like a movie that will leave you confused for 100 minutes.",1288828800,4,446,4.506172839506172
7854545,1,6303871453,"Sorry to say, this is a terrible film. I worked on it as their Location Manager and we shot most of it in Tucson, AZ. It had the makings of a good script but it drug out too much. The only good thing was that the money I made spent as well as any other.",1219881600,3,253,3.618181818181818
7854546,5,6303871453,"This has to be one of the best low-budget films of all time! Michelle Williams, Michael Dorn and Pat Morita are awesome! Jesse needs acting lessons, though he is sufficient for the film.
I don't think that many people will see this film. I rented it after I saw it in the video store. I have no idea why it is [$$] bucks..., maybe because it is hard to get, although I haven't tried looking for it hard.
This is a cool movie about a boy who travels through time to try and stop an evil plot by Dorn to destroy the Earth for a game. The game is kind of hard to explain. It is played for a life-giving substance called 'Blue.' Blue gives it's bearer eternal life, but if you stop taking it you die.
Pat Morita enlists Jesse to stop this game and save his parents from being prisoners of the game. The plot is very complicated, you'll just have to see this movie. It's one-in-a-million. I give it 5 stars.",1022716800,10,902,4.189655172413793
