8205391,3,B000SILENG,"This is a good DVD and it is interesting to see Viktoriya do different types of dance.  I do feel it was a little lackluster on the performances though.  She is dancing for the camera instead of an audience which, I think, makes a big difference.  I had to buy it since I knew she died in 2010. To see great performances by her get ""Temptation of Bellydance"".  This is a much better representation of her work.",1303689600,,410,4.285714285714286
