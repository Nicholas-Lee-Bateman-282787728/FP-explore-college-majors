7921167,5,B00004RER3,"We viewed this movie in 3 VHS cassettes.  Intended to watch the first one, then save the rest for other evenings, however it was so good we finished it up in one evening late.  Excellent movie, acting, directing, etc.  It's set in Australia in perhaps the 1920's... We recommend it highly... Can't say enough praiseworthy words about this ""Golden Fiddles""!!!",1104796800,4,358,4.933333333333334
