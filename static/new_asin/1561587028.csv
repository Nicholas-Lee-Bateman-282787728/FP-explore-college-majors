7796173,5,1561587028,"Mark does an excellent job of narrating and demonstrating everything in this Video. The camera work is good. Good lighting and close ups show all the important details clearly. The video is packed full of useful tips and tricks, even for an old pro. Editing is concise yet nothing crucial is overlooked.

It is a pleasure to see a professionally produced video with a competent skilled craftsman. This is a stark contrast to the glut of unnecessarily long and verbose videos on YouTube by every wood-guru wanna-be. It is concise, informative and even mildly humorous at times. Buy this, you can watch it multiple times without annoying commercials and actual enjoy learning.  It is well worth the money and your time.",1486598400,,717,4.917355371900826
7796174,4,1561587028,"I recently reviewed Duginskes Mastering Woodworking Machines DVD and gave it bad remarks due to its overall content.  This one however, is much more in depth since it is devoted to one single machine.  As one reviewer mentioned, it is a bit short and fast paced, so you feel like you are not really getting all you should be for the $20 price tag.  But, overall I think the material presented was pretty excellent. Uses for the different sized blades as well as what this machine is fully capable of was really eye opening.  the resawing and circle jig info is invaluable.",1459209600,,572,4.578431372549019

7796176,5,1561587028,Seeing is the best way to learn - (along with reading to nail down important facts you need to fully understand techniques so you can extrapolate from that knowledge when new situations require it.)  This DVD is the best I've found.,1413072000,2,232,4.658536585365853
7796177,4,1561587028,"The video is highly recommended for those who want to learn the basics and/or to improve your techniques on the saw. Mark Duginske coverers the basics and mid-level challenges of bandsawing and provides the viewer with options to open your creative powers and produce masterpieces using this tool. I purchased this video looking for a much more basic guide to the features; options; and tuning of the saw. I find ""The Bandsaw Book"" by Lonnie Bird as a companion to Marks' video extremely helpful.",1343174400,,496,4.916666666666667
7796178,5,1561587028,MY HAT IS OFF TO THIS MASTER OF THE BAND SAW.  HIS INSTRUCTIONS ARE GOOD WITHOUT BEING OVER PRODUCED.  TONS OF USEFUL INFO IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING WITH THE BAND SAW AS I AM.,1267747200,4,174,3.942857142857143
7796179,3,1561587028,"The overall quality of this dvd is good. The video contains some good advices and will be a good starter if you are not familiar with a bandsaw.

The video is relatively short but a lot of topics are addressed probably too much.

The first part which explains how to tune your saw is too short and lack details.",1178409600,9,311,4.254237288135593
7796180,5,1561587028,Mark is a master.  He focuses us with detail and demonstration. I enjoy listening to him as much as Norm Abrams. We are not overwhelmed but encouraged.  Mark shows us more than one Bandsaw. The DVD goes well with his book which I have read. Some DVD's or videos overwhelm us and are irratic. Mark is someone whom I feel is mentoring me. I am an intermediate woodbutcher. I can have Mark show me anytime if I forget something.  He is not impressing me  but I am impressed.,1124928000,,471,4.318181818181818
