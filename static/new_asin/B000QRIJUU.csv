2839728,4,B000QRIJUU,"Primetime's documentary of 3 boys with aspergers syndrom is a great overview of the struggles both the persons with aspergers and their families deal with on a daily basis. Each boy has an obsession with something: one with trains, one with washers and dryers, and one with game shows. If only others could understand the importance of these things, too!
The show realistically portrays how the boys and their parents have had to adjust to the challenges that come with aspergers, particularly the difficulties in social situations, and what they are doing to ensure that they do not lose touch with the real world. This video increases anyone's understanding of the world of aspergers.
Thank you for this!",1201737600,11,706,4.991525423728813

8197021,2,B000QRIJUU,"I purchased this DVD in hopes that it would help me explain my son's Aspergers to family. However, it is very brief and general. The aspersers section of this DVD is only a few minutes long. It also is very generic. It is worth watching if it is free, but I can't recommend paying for it. I usually don't judge a product on its price, but this wasn't worth it.",1277856000,8,360,4.1571428571428575
8197022,4,B000QRIJUU,The information was good. It did show some of the problems a child with Aspergers has to deal with. I should have known that this would have been short on time. I will not order another news cast on anything because of how brief they are.,1265068800,,238,4.195652173913044
8197023,2,B000QRIJUU,Interesting video but a little bit too pricy for a video that doesn't give very much detail at all.,1259798400,2,99,4.2631578947368425
8197024,3,B000QRIJUU,"Aspergers kids are intelligent and know more about their interests than the average adult.  Many of our most important discoveries in our world were made by people who were ""different thinkers"".  ABC Primetime does not show how intellegent Asperger kids really are.  The movie states the basic facts but does not get into how people who are blessed with asperger's have really made a difference in our world.",1226361600,5,408,4.970588235294118
8197025,4,B000QRIJUU,I bought this dvd to show my students in my special education class. It was very informative and they found it helpful. A parent of a child with this disorder also said she loved it and wants to recommend it others.,1223078400,,215,4.2682926829268295
8197026,5,B000QRIJUU,"Despite all the current press on autism and Asperger's Syndrome, many people do not understand the autistic child. This DVD demonstrates the difficulties that an Asperger's child faces daily and the problems facing parents who have to deal not only with the child's behavior but the many aspects of having a loved child who is different. Highly recommended for parents, teachers and professionals who want to know more about this disorder.",1219622400,3,439,5.197183098591549
8197027,5,B000QRIJUU,"If you want to understand what a child with asperger's might act like, this is the video for you! I was very impressed with the story of three boys living with asperger's. Each one had his own unique fixation and their openess and honesty about their disability was refreshing to watch!
I would recommend this video to anyone wanting to know more about what asperger's really is like. Kudos to the kids!",1202169600,9,403,4.611111111111111
