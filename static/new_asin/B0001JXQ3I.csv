This is just a way for the Nickelodeon company to get money!  This is not a good deal!  In fact, you  are getting ripped off!  Run away form this so called deal!!Why should you pay for something that you can view free?",1086307200,3,390,4.12

2005795,4,B0001JXQ3I,"Cross-overs between different fictional series are nothing new.  Nearly everything in every form of media has done it and it's quite the promotional tool.
  I can't recall a situation quite like this one here.  Here, characters from different series with very different animations cross over.  Timmy Turner, a 2-D animated character from ""The Fairly Odd Parents"", and Jimmy Neutron, a 3-D CGI created character from ""The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron:  Boy Genius"", cross over into each other's world.  Each encounters the other's daily obstacles and must battle threats to one another's worlds.
  I have only two real problems with this special.  First, while it's cool that the characters comment on the different animation styles (or the two universes' different physical natures as they put it (flat vs. bulgy)), it's just a bit jarring that this had never come up in any form before this in either series.  But, the special's meant for kids, so I'm sure they'll laugh at the humor of that situation and overlook everything else.
  Second, why is Mr. Crocker the only recurring villain from either ""universe""?  Jimmy's got plenty of enemies who just won't quit.  But instead of any of them, we get a completely new threat which results from something supposedly routine.  It's a tiny bit of a flaw.
  Overall, the flaws (major or minor) are minor, even in my eyes.  I would have liked to see our two protagonists working together more, but what I got was all right.  It would have been nice to see more of Timmy's friends in this (i.e. Chester and A.J.) but we got Cosmo and Wanda, so I suppose it evens out.  My favorite part of the special is near the end when the two main characters physically meet for the first time.  It was dramatic and done very well.  The part right after was corny and I could have done without.
  If you like Timmy Turner, Jimmy Neutron, and the adventures they have as individuals, you'll definitely like this special.  If you like at least one of them, you're still in for a good time and you might be drawn to the other.  For everyone else, it's still worth watching and you'll surely be drawn to at least one of these characters.  Enjoy.",1405209600,,2171,4.702127659574468

2005798,4,B0001JXQ3I,"I don't get cable tv so I can monitor what my children watch.  Dvds are a good way to control the kids' viewing hours.  I heard that this was a good show and started with a rental.  The kids liked it enough to request it.  I then bought the dvd and they watch it several times/week.  The animation is appealing and brightly colored.  It contrasts greatly with the anime type of art, which is flat and more subtle.  I would recommend this for kids and think it has repeat playability.",1175990400,2,483,4.3
