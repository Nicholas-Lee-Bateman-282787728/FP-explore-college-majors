6684536,5,B00NY9ATQ4,AWESOME BUNDLE!!!! I lost the first 2 so this is perfect to replace them AND add Boxtrolls to the collection!! Someone's a GENIUS!!!! LoL. Not sure why it received 1 star though... all 3 movies are definitely available separately... lol. Great Buy!!!!,1421798400,,251,5.0

6684540,1,B00NY9ATQ4,If you already own Coraline or ParaNorman there is no reason to invest in them again.

6684551,5,B00NY9ATQ4,"I played them in the new Oppo UDP-205, and everything is fine. Including the 3D.

Laika films are decidedly different. Though nominally ""family"" films, they have an adult sensibility. I'm surprised children will sit through them (qv, the highly negative reactions to ""Rango""). All lean heavily on fantasy and the supernatural, focusing on the importance of strong family relationships.

The problem with fantasy stories is that you can do ""anything"", without being required to justify it. Where do box trolls exist? What sort of magical universe does Coraline's ""other mother"" come from? Only ""ParaNormaN"" treads familiar ground -- people seeing spirits. I find this lack of connection with existing mythology to be a bit off-putting (because it seems somewhat arbitrary), * but others will not.

Visually, the Laika films are absolute knockouts. Everything is shown in extravagant detail, as if the artists have a doll-house fixation on absolute accuracy. The stop-motion animation uses conventional DSLRs, which allow immediate viewing as the animator's work. This permits exact positioning that virtually eliminates the occasional jerkiness of conventional stop motion. (No offense, Ray.)

Laika's stories play out on large sets, and the 3D makes you feel you've walked into a ""real"" fantasy world.

I've seen all four Laika films, and regardless of the ""official"" ratings, they should be considered PG. There's an awful lot of strange and scary stuff likely to frighten small children. And ""ParaNormaN"" is arguably PG-13, as one of the characters reveals he's gay, in a clever line of throw-away dialog.

Strongly recommended, even if you're only interested in seeing how good 3D movies can be.

* The Grimms' collection of folk tales derives from centuries of European tradition (witches, spells, transformations, etc). ""Riders in the Sky"" might be American C&W, but it's based on European tales of ""der wilde Jagd"" (the wild hunt).",1494028800,2,1937,5.3519736842105265

Coraline is about a girl who feels neglected by her busy family.  A creepy button eyed family, who are pretending to be nice so she will let the mother eat her.

Boxtrolls is about trolls who wear only boxes and are believed to eat children.  They don't all they do is hide.

6684639,5,B00NY9ATQ4,Amazing bundle I love all these movies!!!  If you don't like the bundle just by the boxtrolls  no one is forcing you to do anything.  I love this now I can have a digital copy of my paranorman and coraline!!,1421971200,,207,4.125
6684640,5,B00NY9ATQ4,"This is awesome - Although I have Coraline already (DVD) I was going to purchase the BoxTrolls anyway, and what a great way to upgrade Coraline to BluRay, get another movie (ParaNorman) that I probably wouldn't buy unless on sale for <$10, and get the codes to add all three to my UltraViolet and Digital HD libraries!!",1421971200,,319,4.614035087719298

8681034,5,B00NY9ATQ4,Best 3D collection. With all 3 of these movies the 3D really adds something special to the movie. I was never a huge fan of Coralline but have found a new appreciation for the film in 3D. These movies use the 3D in a way that really enhances the movie and creates a much fuller environment.,1530489600,,290,4.196428571428571
