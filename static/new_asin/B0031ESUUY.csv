8603399,5,B0031ESUUY,"Well acted and thoughtfully constructed. Cinematography was excellent, and the although it's clearly a fictional take on historical figure like Goebbels, it is entertaining nonetheless. Ignore the 1 star review that posted before mine - he/she was obviously looking for something they'd expect to find on the History Channel, rather than a ""different"" take like Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards. The Last Day of Joseph Goebbels is by no means as loose as the aforementioned Tarantino film, but it does make you feel sympathetic toward Goebbels' family and situation, which understandably some people would not be comfortable with...but the Nazi's regime is not the focus of the film - it's about Goebbels' internal struggle with what to do with his family when the Russians were moments away from taking his entire family into custody. *****",1276041600,,840,5.323308270676692
