8398553,5,B003JYOFPA,My daughter loves these DVDS!,1435276800,,29,5.0
8398554,5,B003JYOFPA,I got the Arabic learning set for my children and it's really helping them. Very good quality content. Two thumbs up.,1401062400,,117,4.619047619047619
8398555,2,B003JYOFPA,This had great reviews so I actually got 3 different languages hoping it would be longer and have more content than the Bilingual baby DVDs we have. My 2 1/2 yr old will sit and watch a bilingual baby over and over but he is not engaged by the boring cartoonish scenes nor the high pitched voice used to teach the language. The high pitched little voice does not sound natural to me so I can't understand it enough to work with my son and teach during times the video isn't playing like I can with my other brand discs. I do like that the format is similar with various languages but it simply doesn't stimulate my child's visual or auditory senses and he roams off within minutes.,1396483200,,681,4.328125
