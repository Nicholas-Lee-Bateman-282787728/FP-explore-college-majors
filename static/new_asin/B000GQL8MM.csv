8133886,4,B000GQL8MM,"While there is not a single DVD release of this opera that combines all the best elements, this is one of the three best versions.  Performed at the Drottningholm Theater in Sweden, the musicians perform on period instruments in 18th century garb.  The staging is likewise very much what one would have seen in Mozart's own time -- no absurd ventures into Regietheater here!  The conducting is wonderfully lithe, and the two pairs of sopranos and tenors are first-rate.  The one fly in the ointment is the Osmin, who is not bad but is simply much too light-voiced for his role and lacks the cavernous low notes needed to be fully both a comic and menacing presence.  The other two best alternatives are the Covent Garden performances conducted by Georg Solti, with Kurt Moll as the Osmin for the ages but an overly low-key Constanze and Belmonte in Inga Nielsen and Deon van der Walt, and the Glyndebourne production conducted by Gustav Kuhn, in which none of the singers is a first choice for his or her role but all are more than satisfying and make for a well-rounded production.",1385596800,,1082,4.673684210526316
8133887,4,B000GQL8MM,"The Drottningholm series of Mozart operas are a sure bet in almost every case and this is no exception.  It is such a pleasure to see staging that is imaginative yet does not create a space which is contrary to the time and characters that the composer and librettist intended.  One sees the same basic stage structures in almost every setting of these operas which adds enormously to the charm.  The word ""pretentious"" never comes to mind.  Needless to say the orchestral playing on original instruments under Ostman is superb.  The singing is a bit less assured to my ear compared to other versions but not so much as to make the product unenjoyable.  For me, Valerie Masterson is the most appealing Constanze and Willard White the best Osmin but that version, from Glyndbourne,may not be ""hi-fi"" enough for some audiophiles.  Richard Croft is the best known singer on this set.  His passage work is astounding but I find his voice too tightly produced for my personal taste. Still, you cannot go wrong with this version for a basic, no nonsense performance.",1218758400,6,1060,4.785714285714286
8133888,5,B000GQL8MM,"Full disclosure: I don't have this DVD. But I happened to watch ""Martern aller Arten"" on Youtube where it lived a few days or hours before being removed. Aga Winska in singing was second only to a very few (Arleen Auger young, Edda Moser), and by little; her acting was outstanding, the whole staging too, with everything very intelligently and carefully done, from colors to moves and songs, full of life, sensible, a feast for ears *and eyes*, making that ""Martern"" one of the best I ever watched. I can't understand why that video was not left on Youtube, it would have brought customers - and warm reviewers on this page.
