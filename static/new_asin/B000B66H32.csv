8082155,3,B000B66H32,"This review is not a complaint about ordering the wrong product, this is a review of the documentary THE GANGSTER CHRONICLES. This is an interesting documentary about Organized Crime. From the establishment of the mob in New York's Lower East Side - through the lawlessness and growth of the underworld spawned by prohibition - to today's ruthless bosses, this 3 Hours Documentary tells the story of the mobsters who ruled the crime empires of America for over 100 years.

If, like me, you enjoy watching documentaries about the Mafia/True Crime/History then you'll enjoy this DVD. The episodes are both in color and Black and White, the narrator is great and all episodes are full of interesting information. This is not the most entertaining Documentary I ever saw, but I enjoyed it. And the price is very low ( $5 brand new ), so I'm not complaining. However CRIME INC is a superior documentary, by far the best documentary ever made about the Mafia. If you already own CRIME INC and want to add another documentary to your collection then go for it, you won't regret it. List Of Episodes:

1. The Roaring Twenties ( 60 minutes )
At the end of World War I, European immigrants flooded into America. They moved into ghettos, rarely able to find decent work, and were generally shunned by the rest of society. On January 16, 1920, prohibition went into effect and closed every bar in the nation. Millions of drinkers were suddenly turned into criminals and forced to go underground to satisfy their thirst. Two young, ambitious first generation immigrants saw an incredible opportunity to provide, for a price, a once legal product to the masses. Their names were Johnny ""Papa"" Torrio and Alfonse ""Scarface"" Capone. They were not the first bootleggers and would have some stiff competition, but in the end, Capone would use the thirteen years of prohibition to turn himself into the Godfather of Crime.

2. The Violent Years ( 60 minutes )
By the end of the 1920's, the depression had hit America hard, millions were jobless as a result of the stock market crash and thousands more were forced off their farms by the great dust storms in the Midwest. But, for organized crime, the depression was a boom. More and more people were turning to alcohol to try and forget their misery and the prospect of easy money made illegal gambling extremely popular. As the law finally caught up with Al Capone, many others were ready to take his place. New York gangsters, Meyer Lansky and Charlie ""Lucky"" Luciano, along with friends like Frank Costello and Bugsy Siegel, helped to forge a more organized criminal empire. The depression also spawned many criminals who operated independent of Mob control, including kidnapper George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, bank robber and murderer, John Dillinger and the infamous duo of Bonnie and Clyde.

3. Crime, Inc. ( 60 minutes )
As Lucky Luciano and his fellow gangsters continued to spread their tentacles of crime across the nation, Bugsy Siegel went to Hollywood to become the Mafia's point man out west. Bugsy brought the rackets on the West Coast under mob control, but also had a big dream that he hoped would turn Nevada sand into mobster gold. Although Bugsy would not live to see his dream come true, his legacy grew, creating the gaudy, money-soaked world of Las Vegas. With the upswing of gambling in the legal casinos of Nevada and Cuba, money laundering became big business. Rumors of possible CIA involvement in these schemes and several other illegal dealings could never be proven but the links between the two organizations seemed to grow stronger. As the years passed, a new style of gangster was born in John Gotti. Like ""Scarface"" Al Capone, Gotti loved to be in the public eye. Arrested on numerous occasions, he became known as the ""Teflon Don"" because none of the arrests seemed to stick. The law eventually caught up with Gotti when several friends turned against him, but the mob, as it has for over one hundred years, continues on.",1345420800,,3983,4.827232796486091
8082156,2,B000B66H32,"Twice I ordered the VHS version, thinking it was a collapsed version of the movie series; it wasn't on dvd yet. The second one had, somehow, not seemed to be a documentary, but it turned out to be. I have the 1981 tv series of Gangster Chronicles starring Michale Nouri, Joe Penny et al in VHS. However, I bought it dubbed in  the 1990s and the quality is not very good. I badly want the complete series on DVD. WOULD AMAZON PLEASE TRY TO GET IT!Please use your ingenuity; it should be possible to get it, if not from the original source or the tv station/s who serialized it, then from someone who has a good copy on VHS. It should be possible for AMAZON to render it in DVD form.

I might add that it does seem that Amazon does now state with the item that it is a documentary and not the original series. That is important. I have now learnt that the TV series was run on NBC. It should not be impossible for Amazon to get it. Feedback from them as to their intentions concerning our pleas would help.",1340496000,,1004,4.196891191709844
8082157,1,B000B66H32,"I was very unhappy with this DVD as I expected to recieve a DVD of the excellant tv show of same name, with the actors listed for this.
