With all the emotional range of a statue, she plays petulant, entitled and dim without a trace of the concealed vulnerability which might make one care about her fate. Why Ben doesn't stand up for himself against this pill, throw in the towel and head for the door makes him come off as a wishy-washy, masochistic, self loathing wimp.

6454016,4,B00KYOZU4S,"As I post this review there are already six reviews posted. All of them are based on the theater version of this 2014 film. This review will provide a few comments on the film itself as well as the bonus features on the DVD release from Strand Home Video.

The review from my fellow reviewer Paul Donavan gives a pretty good summary of the film - and I'm glad that he did not reveal the ending as it would spoil the enjoyment of the film. I knew nothing going in other than the fact that it starred British actor Ben Whishaw (who I only knew from the BBCs wonderful series ""The Hour"").  I do not watch Asian films generally so actress Ceng Pei Pei was unknown to me. I knew the film was about a gay couple and that it was in both English and Cantonese. The English subtitles are easy to read and they really occur mostly in the opening scenes.

I was quietly drawn into the film by Asian born - but British raised  - film director Hong Khaou. No, it's not the best film I've seen recently but it was well worth spending the 86-minute running time with these characters.  While there is nudity, there are homosexual love scenes but they are handled nicely. (Just an alert to parents.).

I came away from the film wanting to know why the director chose the title and what it meant. I learned this and more by watching the two bonus features, mostly the 10 minute interview with director Khaou. The interview was filmed in a room with a lot of echo - so you'll have to adjust your sound volume - but Khaou reveals, not only the title's meaning but how the script changed from the time he originally wrote it as a play until he re-wrote as a screenplay. This Interview really adds to understanding the film. The other bonus is an eight-minute short film ""Summer"" that Khaou made in 2006 - and which stars (like ""Lilting"") a Caucasian male and his Cambodian buddy. The original Trailer is here too.

If you are willing to take a chance on it, I think you'll be rewarded by watching this DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6454018,1,B00KYOZU4S,"Lilting has gotten such great reviews, from professional critics and from viewers, that I couldn't wait for its release in the US and ordered it from the UK. When it arrived this afternoon I dropped everything I was doing to watch it.

I can't remember ever being as disappointed in a movie as I was in this one. It's not because my expectations were too high, because that's happened with other movies and I've adapted to reduced expectations as I watched them. But Lilting is SO bad - in every way except for the cinematography and, occasionally, Ben Whishaw - that the only way I could even get all the way through it to the end was by trying to think of ways it could have been even worse.

Lilting's insurmountable problem is its screenplay, which is heavyhanded and depressingly stupid; the greatest director and actors on earth couldn't have made it work.

Kai's mother is so hard and cruel and selfish that she needs somebody to slap her. Instead, everybody bows and scrapes and lies and grovels before her, trying to avert her displeasure, as if she's some blind, squat, pitiless, demonic, all-devouring swamp goddess. Their neurotic, masochistic toadying is even more disgusting than her monstrous selfishness is.

Whishaw's Richard is sweet and gentle and kind, and to watch as he debases himself trying to please that self-centered old b! tch made me physically sick. And Kai? What did Richard ever see in that jerk? He and his horrible mother are perfect for each other.

The story is infuriatingly stupid, every word of dialog is stilted, ponderous and unbelievable, the direction is jerky, all the characters are revolting, with mediocre actors playing them (except Whishaw), and I wish I'd never even heard of this awful movie.

I feel like the only fool in the wildly cheering crowd who can see that the emperor is naked. I'm sure the throngs around me who are ecstatic about this movie will vote my review into the abyss of uselessness, but there's nothing I can do about that. I don't understand them any better than they understand me. All I can do is tell the truth as I see it.

I adore Ben Whishaw; he's beautiful, enormously intelligent, enormously sexy and enormously talented, and I'd watch him in ANYTHING. He has the most beautiful voice God ever gave to a human being. But I hope he never, ever, EVER gets involved in another movie like this one. It's just about as bad as a movie can be.",1417651200,4,2417,4.686320754716981

6454020,4,B00KYOZU4S,"The United Kingdom submitted this tender drama for the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival. (This review was first published in May, 2014.) Recipient of the Cinematography Award at Sundance 2014, we expect excellence...and we get it!

Our central character has been moved to a nursing home by her son.  The ""best friend"" of her now deceased son hires an interpreter to help her communicate, both with him and with a gentleman who also lives in that retirement home and wants to court her.

Director Hong Khaou brings us:
  * Pei-pei Cheng (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") is Junn, unable to bridge the language barrier without the assistance of an excellent interpreter. She wants her son's ashes!
  * Andrew Leung (some TV) is Kai, the deceased son, whom we meet in numerous flashbacks.
  * Ben Whitshaw (""Cloud Atlas"") as Richard, who wants to fulfill the wishes of his dead lover, come out of the closet and make peace with Richard's mother about it.
  * Peter Bowles (""The Bank Job"") his Alan needs just a teeny smile and he comes a'courting.
  * Morven Christie (Lots of TV - BBC) is Margaret, the woman who serves as a most welcome interpreter for Junn, Richard and Alan.

We learn many things over the course of this insightful character study: 1) Some things are better left unspoken. 2) Some things are better out in the open. 3) Good and decent folks deserve to be happy.

Although personally I didn't appreciate her style of mothering, I was happy for Junn with that pleasant ending.",1413936000,10,1501,4.785992217898833
6454021,5,B00KYOZU4S,"Nine Things About Lilting (United Kingdom, 2014)

1. This is a startlingly excellent examination of solitude and connection.

2. Set in England, it's about a young man, Richard, an elderly Cambodian woman, Junn, who speaks no English, and the dead man that ties them together.

3. Junn's son, Kai, recently put his mother in an assisted living home, because he could no longer care for her. Unbeknownst to her, Kai's best friend, Richard, is actually his long time boyfriend.

4. After Kai's sudden death, Richard feels obligated to help out Junn somehow, so he hires a young translator to help the blossoming relationship between Junn and another resident of the home, Allen.

5. As the four begin an awkward journey of getting to know each other, they inadvertently open hidden wounds... and pour salt in others.

6. The acting in the movie is impeccable. It's a small cast, and relatively unknown - at least here in the US. But I'd been waiting to see Ben Whishaw in something again ever since ""Perfume"" (no, I don't really count ""Skyfall"")

7. It's really hard to make a movie work when it's almost all talking around tables. The fact that half of it also needs to be verbally translated - on screen - makes it even worse. But I guess first-time director Hong Khaou didn't know this was supposed to be hard. He took this one all the way home.

8. Let's face it - this movie is going to be a hard movie to sell - ""No really, it's good! It's about gays and Asians and old people talking to each other!"" There's no violence or sex or scandal. There's not even an exciting soundtrack. And it's too bad that many people will miss this movie. It's one of the best depictions of the human experience that I've seen in a long time.

9. This movie is about the varying levels of isolation that people feel, and the intersections of those levels. It's a quiet, poetic, sad, masterpiece.",1413072000,36,1880,4.571428571428571
6454022,4,B00KYOZU4S,"Superficially speaking, the subject of LILTING resembles that of LOST IN TRANSLATION (2003), as Junn, a Cambodian Chinese mother (Pei-pei Cheng) living in London mourns the loss of her son Kai (Andrew Leung), while trying and failing to communicate with those around her.  Kai's boyfriend Richard (Ben Whishaw), wants to help her, and engages the service of Vann, a translator (Naomi Christie) so that communication between himself and Junn might be improved.  Meanwhile Alan (Peter Bowles), an elderly man, embarks on his own pursuit of Junn's hand.

However Hong Khaou's film looks at the difficulties of communication at a much deeper level than the purely linguistic.  He invites us to reflect on the wisdom of Kai's decision to put his mother in sheltered accommodation, whose dingy dcor is designed to make elderly people 'feel better.'  Despite Richard's basic kindness and his protestations of endless love for Kai, we wonder whether he actually understand what either Kai or Junn actually think.  Maybe it's not really necessary to hire a translator: communication between individuals can take place at a subliminal level.  Vann does her best to act as an intermediary between Junn and Richard, or Junn and Alan, but it's clear that her role is a peripheral one in the drama of familial relationships across cultures.

Shot in deliberately dark colors, LILTING depicts a world whose protagonists live in perpetual isolation, both literal as well as psychological.  Junn's sheltered accommodation is both dark and prison-like; her fellow-residents seldom communicate except in clichs (Alan included).  Richard's apartment is full of long, brick-lined passages; his kitchen is full of dirty cutlery, suggesting a fundamental inability to cope with life.

Our relationship with the two central protagonists is a complex one.  Whishaw tries his best to render Richard a sympathetic character, but the more effort he makes to try and bridge the cultural differences separating himself from Junn, the more frustrated he becomes.  His final outburst, where he accuses Junn of failing to ""assimilate"" to contemporary British cultures, is a classic colonialist statement, leaving us to reflect on why he himself did not do more to adapt himself to her mores.  By contrast Junn remains both silent and serene; her final soliloquy reveals her determination to continue her existence, despite the prospect of future loneliness.  She does not need to ""assimilate""; she has found her own way to negotiate the culture she inhabits.

Modestly budgeted yet memorably staged by a director with an obvious affinity for the material, LILTING is an absorbing cinematic experience.",1412812800,15,2668,5.3317422434367545

6454027,4,B00KYOZU4S,"The DVD cover says it is emotionally charged and it is. I did cry at the end. Ben Whishaw is trying desperately to get through to his boyfriends Cambodian mother who is in a home in England because she can't know that her son Kai is gay and that Richard is his boyfriend. She is sad and depressed all the time and it is a tough movie because of the basic premise of it. Richard is trying but for possible selfish reasons, Mom (Junn) is angry and jealous of Richard and Kai but to her they are close friends, Richard brings in a young lady to translate for him and for her and the man she seems to be dating at the home. Junn, is always sad and angry and it is her character I assume but it gets tedious. Richard is always pushing so hard and has a constant hurt puppy look on his face (you will see why) but it gets to be too much.

So incredibly well done that the sub-titles were not even noticeable soon after the start of the film.",1444262400,,452,5.054054054054054
6454032,4,B00KYOZU4S,"I liked the movie, but as an Asian guy, I can tell you that older generations Asians don't act this way.
There are inconsistencies in the movie.  If I recall, the Cambodian/Chinese family moved to England 5 years ago.  Would Kai be so English if he had moved to England only 5 years ago?  Some things just don't make sense... but everything doesn't make perfect sense in movies.  Just ignore and enjoy, they would say.
White people don't act that way either.  An old White guy would not date an old Asian woman he cannot communicate with.
Plus in reality, the mother would probably move into a nursing home where there are other people who speak her language.  That would only make too much sense.

.",1441929600,,700,4.507936507936508
6454033,4,B00KYOZU4S,"The film's story revolves around Kai's mother, Junn, and his lover, Richard.  An Asian immigrant, Junn has not adapted to many of the ways of her adopted country, England. The fact that she doesn't speak English just adds to her sense of isolation.  With the passing of Kai's father, she becomes dependent on him.  Kai wants to bring her to the place he shares with Richard instead of the senior housing room she's currently in, but he hasn't come out to her as a gay person, and she hasn't taken a liking to Richard.

The film opens with Kai visiting his mother at her senior housing room. He apologizes for taking so long to get to her because he has taken the bus instead of asking Richard to drive him.  Kai's mother gives him the ""look,"" to which Kai responds with some exasperation: ""What's with the 'look', Mum?"" Kai's mother tells him he's nice to his friend, but she's important too because she's his mother and his family.  After some more small talk, an attendant knocks on the door and enters the room. She doesn't acknowledge Kai or say hi to him, because he's not really in the room. Kai's mother has just been reminiscing.

The audience immediately feels Kai's mother's loneliness. But Kai's lover, Richard, also has his own cross to bear. He desperately wants to bridge the world he and Kai live in with the one Kai's mother lives in, because Kai means the world to him.  He tries to reach out to Kai's mother, but he doesn't speak Mandarin.

The film is a realistic study of what tends to pull people who do care about each other apart as well as draw them back in together. The actor who plays Richard, Ben Whishaw, is terrific, but the actors playing, Kai, Junn, and the translator who helps Junn and Richard communicate, are also good.  The film's pacing, which for the most part is slow, suddenly speeds up briefly near the ending, and things feel rushed and the dialogs take a somewhat preachy turn at that point, but otherwise, I thought the movie is touching and moving.",1440633600,2,1994,4.544692737430168

6454036,4,B00KYOZU4S,"""Lilting"" deals with grief, how people handle it and how people overcome it. If they do overcome it. Perhaps what's most important is that it reminds us that people deal with grief very differently, and for the most part, that's okay.
Kai has died suddenly. And in the aftermath, two people struggle with death. Junn, his mother who lives in a home for the elderly, and Richard, his partner with whom he shared a home.
Junn doesn't speak English, she never acclimated from her Chinese culture to her British one, and she detests Richard who she believes came between her and her only son. She grieves silently, and when with others, often with bitter words.
Richard's heart is shattered. He's is often a second away from tears. He doesn't speak Mandarin, he knows Junn doesn't like him, but he feels compelled to try to make a connection.
The story is told via flashbacks that include Kai, as the characters grapple with coming out, caring for the elderly, and language and cultural differences.
It's easy to make judgment calls about the characters - Junn is bitter, Richard is weak. But in the end, it's their grief. And anyone who has lost loved ones knows that finding happiness after grief is an individual journey left to the bearer of the pain. Slowly Junn and Richard get to the other side. But it does take time.",1434931200,,1321,4.67381974248927
6454037,5,B00KYOZU4S,"A moving story and wonderfully crafted project. The acting, the emotions and the concept are all moving. This is one of my all time favorite movies.

A comedic aside- this is the only item ever that disappeared in transit or was stolen (amazon promote sent me a new one). OBVIOUSLY someone saw it and decided they needed to watch it :-)",1431561600,,336,4.508196721311475
6454038,4,B00KYOZU4S,"In the interview he does in the Bonus Features, director Hong Khaou reveals that the character of the mother in ""Lilting"" is inspired partly by his own mother who has lived in Britain for thirty years and still does not know any English, and his own frustration with that fact.  He, also, tells that in the original stage play, the young couple comprised a man and woman, but he always felt that something was lacking and that the story was missing a more powerful element.  So, he changed it for the screen.

Openly-gay, British actor Ben Wishaw stars with renowned Chinese film star Cheng Pei-Pei and actor Andrew Leung.  The cast is rounded out with veteran British actor Peter Bowles and a relative newcomer Naomi Christie.  Christie plays the role of Vann, and she has an extra burden on her acting in her role of a translator in which so much of what she does involves her reactions to what she has to translate.  She pulls that off well.

It is great to see two acting warhorses such as Peter Bowles and Cheng Pei-Pei on screen.  I have to confess that it took me a little while to recognize Peter Bowles as being Richard DeVere from one of my favourite comedy shows ever ""To The Manor Born.""  He nails his role down.  As for Cheng Pei-Pei, she can show a world of emotion with just small changes in her facial expressions.  One can watch anger build in her face, or see the rare moments of delight when she is with her son, or when she is listening to a Chinese version of a big band song.

Wishaw is a young British man who feels a responsibility to Cheng who is a Chinese-Cambodian in a retirement home.  Tied together by their ties to Cheng's son, they are, also, tied by tragedy.  In addition, Cheng is facing the tragedy of growing older in a strange land alone. They are divided by personal resentments, culture and language.  The film illustrates the slow dance between them as they become more involved with each other.  The in tandem performances of these two is one of the best parts of this film.

Ben Wishaw and Andrew Leung are quite appealing when they are together.  This compatibility makes the viewer want to see more of them, and it makes the flashbacks more poignant.  We see what Wishaw saw.  This makes his character more comprehensible, and the viewer can understand how he is barely holding himself together, and at times, seems about to come apart.  So much of this movie lies in the past with people who now are not sure how they are going to handle their future.

I cannot say that this is a cheerful film.  There is no blissful happiness here, just the truth of the difficulties of aging and dealing with others close to us. When Cheng speaks from her heart near the end, I am sure those who are older, or know those who are older, will be able to empathize.

Bonus Features on the DVD comprise an Interview with Director Hong Khaou, the Short Film ""Summer,"" Original Theatrical Trailer and the Strand Trailers: ""Girlhood,"" ""Stranger by the Lake,"" ""The Way He Looks"" and ""Love is the Devil.""  In ""Devil,"" one can see Daniel Craig before he became Bond; ""Devil,"" also, stars Tilda Swinton and Derek Jacobi.

8662703,3,B00KYOZU4S,"This film has so much going for it that I hate to give it a tepid review. The acting and production values are first-class, and it has authentic pathos. The problem is that the film grows tedious when there is no dramatic relief from the unrelenting gloom of its characters. The Asian mother in the film is reluctant to give up her only son to his ""best friend,"" played by Ben Whishaw. The director means to imply that her ethnicity has something to do with this reluctance; however, homophobia is universal and knows no ethnicity. I believe that you will understand my meaning if you see the film.

8662707,2,B00KYOZU4S,"not to sound too callous,  I found this film too tedious and the ending overly melodramatic --- good acting though.
