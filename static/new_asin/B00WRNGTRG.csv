7149110,3,B00WRNGTRG,"I think all ages could like this movie, as long as your somewhat of a basketball fan, well maybee not even that. With famous basketball star Michael Jordan of Chicago Bulls starring along with cartoon classic Bugs Bunny and Moron Mountain space critters Loony Toons go head 2 head on the b-ball court.",971395200,,301,4.69811320754717
7149111,2,B00WRNGTRG,Attention!  My rating is not intended for the film itself but for Warner Brother's decision not to give us a widescreen or letterboxed format of  this movie.  Anyone who has been holding out for a special edition of this  film will only be half pleased when they realize the film is still shown in  the pan and scan format.  I understand this film is aimed at children and  that they might not like it letterboxed but you could at least give us the  choice like Columbia Tristar did when they released Stuart Little (both a  pan and scan and a widescreen version were made available on DVD for this  film).  Come on WB!  Get with the program!,966211200,12,642,4.3931623931623935
7149112,2,B00WRNGTRG,"Let me start this conversation by stating that this movie was an utter failure. When me and my friend decided to see this movie a few years back  we thought we were in for some totally insane comedy by the Looney Tunes  cast. Boy were we wrong.  This movie was not good. I gave it two stars  because it had a few suprising cameos in it like Bill Murray that were  actually funny. This movie degrades the image of Bugs and the rest of the  Warner Bros. cast. As i remember that in the cartoons most of the  characters were afraid of nothing, no matter what size and they could  overcome any obstacle. On this movie the cartoon character you grew to love  has been degraded into crying little babie that cant outwitt a bunch of  martian idiots. How lame! Bugs Bunny, the cartoon character that was know  for his talent to out witt all that try to get him couldn't even stop them.  Why would they nee the help of an over the hill basketball player, Michael  Jordon, when they are cartoon characters that can do anything they want. I  once thought that cartoon characters were unstoppable- not anymore.  I  hate this movie. It goes against everything you grew to love in your  childhood. Maybe your children will like it. The original cartoons will  always be the best no matter what tries to out do them.  Thank you  for your time.",966124800,7,1328,4.409090909090909
7149113,5,B00WRNGTRG,"Hmmm...let's see... a very clever, crafty storyline,...eye-stunning animation,...very witty visual gags...really cool characters, including our classic old friends from the Looney Tunes and the the world's best  basketball player ever to be born and carefully nurtured...with a few  really bold gross-out shots thrown in ... and all mixed together...YOU GET  SPACE JAM!  You will never see your most favorite WB characters the same  way again - they are animated far more graphically than they had ever been  in their old cartoons of the Golden Age. Included are the new characters  like the cigar-chewing Mafia boss from Mars with his very tall and muscular  ""Monstars"" basketball players and Lola Bunny who hates to be  called ""doll"" and then acts like a doll, much to Bugs Bunny's  delighted, heart-thumping infatuation. Oh, and don't forget a very round  nerdball that looks just like he finally escaped being eaten alive by a  fan-faced dinosaur at Jurassic Park, too! Oh, you will truly thrill at such  a zany, bumpy-bouncing space adventure amusement park ride with all your  god-witnessed heroes, both live action and animated alike!",957312000,2,1141,5.266666666666667

The answer is nothing...not even the NSA, CIA, or obama's former TelePrompTer could have defeated these aliens...only Jordan, Bugs, and a backwards ball cap wearing Bill ""Caddy Shack"" Murray could have.

7149207,5,B00WRNGTRG,"Space Jam is a wonderful movie full of basketball, humor, looney toons, and a ton of other things.  I give space jam 5 stars.  Space Jam is a great movie for everyone who loves Michael Jordon and even people that dont, also if you love looney toons then you would love it.
 This movie is about aliens in space who own a amusement park but is losing business so they need a new attraction, they hear about the looney tonns, and go to capture them. They get to looney toon land, and capture bugs bunny, but clever bugs bunny challenges the small puny aliens to a game of basketball to defend themselves.  The aliens don't know anything about basketball and they go and steal famous basketball players power to play the game.  Since Michael Jordon just retired and is playing baseball, the aliens don't pick him.  The looney toons need help so they kidnap michael so he can play.  Michael helps the looney toons to get better and they have a final basketball game.
 Everyone would like this movie unless you hate MJ and basketball. Or you just have no soul and don't like humor.  But to be honest I wasn't the biggest Michael Jordan fan, but when I watched this it became my favorite movie",1489104000,,1186,4.453703703703703

7149273,2,B00WRNGTRG,"Space Jam: 20th Anniversary Edition stars basketball superstar Michael Jordan and cartoon star Bugs Bunny, who team up with other basketball greats and Looney Tunes characters in this combination animated/live action feature. Jordan must help the Looney Tunes gang with a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures whose plan  if they win  is to kidnap the Looney Tunes gang and take them to a failing intergalactic amusement park as the latest attraction.

This film was made in 1996 as a vehicle to revive interest in the stable of Warner Bros. animated stars, which had languished for some time. In addition to Bugs Bunny, the film features Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepe Le Pew, and Marvin the Martian. Human actors include Bill Murray, Wayne Knight and the voice of Danny De Vito. Basketball pros Charles Barkley, Larry Bird and Patrick Ewing also appear.

Though the film often captures the frenetic pace of classic Warner cartoons, a feature-length film is too long a stretch to sustain this very slight story. Though no one can criticize Mr. Jordans skills on the court, his acting is strictly amateurish. At the time, he was a much in-demand pitchman for assorted products, but none of the commercials he did required him to sustain a performance. He just had to be himself. Thats true here, too, but he has so little to work with, script-wise, he simply interacts with a bunch of animated critters with either a look of surprise or a broad smile, putting in a minimum of effort.

Bonus extras on the steelbook Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include commentary by Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and director Joe Pytka; the featurette Jammin With Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan; 2 music videos: Seals Fly Like an Eagle and the movie casts Monsters Anthem Hit Em High; and a theatrical trailer.",1479168000,,1829,4.887096774193548
7149274,3,B00WRNGTRG,I expected more from a 20th anniversary edition of Space Jam. The special features are from the old edition and there is nothing new other than the box art about this. Still a good movie and nice to see after all these years. The bluray doesn't really clean up the film but it is definitely better than VHS-DVD,1479081600,8,310,4.362068965517241

Part of the kick of this movie when it came out was seeing Jordan interact with the Looney Tunes. It was an element of the time in which it was made.

7149364,5,B00WRNGTRG,"I hadn't watched this movie since I was a kid, but I was eager to revisit it to see if I would enjoy it as much as an adult. Time has certainly not diminished my love for this movie. Michael Jordan is great in this movie. It's nice to see him in a playful role after reading stories about his legendary competitive fire. Overall, this is a fun, fast-paced movie that is great for kids and big kids. The basketball fan in me was a little appalled by the number of obvious flagrant fouls committed in the game by both side (which went uncalled by referee Marvin the Martian), and the fact that the clock operator seemed to be sleeping (seriously, 5 seconds passed in the movie while only one second came off the clock), but this movie requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. It is about a bunch of cartoon characters playing basketball against aliens, after all. I also enjoyed the cameos by NBA stars like Larry Bird, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, and Shawn Bradley, whose only skill at basketball is being really, really tall.",1471996800,3,1031,4.518716577540107

7149443,5,B00WRNGTRG,"Five stars. I don't understand why you even had to ask. Michael Jordan is a delight in this family friendly film. I've heard people slam (pun INTENDED) this movie, criticizing Jordan's acting skills. HE HAD TO ACT IN A MOVIE WITH CARTOON CHARACTERS. You think Bugs Bunny and Tweety Bird were actually there talking to him? No. He was PRETENDING the whole time. If that's not acting I don't know what is. I'm going to go out on a limb and say Space Jam is the single greatest movie of all time. And it's all because of Michael Jordan. You think Dennis Rodman could have pulled that off? No. He doesn't have the talent nor the sweet pleated khakis to deliver that type of performance.",1470787200,22,682,4.464

7149456,4,B00WRNGTRG,"I remembered watching Space Jam in the theater when it first came out, and I loved it. I re-watched it again with my daughter, and loved it a little less. Michael Jordan isn't the best actor in the world, but working with cartoons isn't exactly an easy thing to do, and it is a kid's movie, so I'll give him a pass. The ""talent-less"" basketball players are pretty funny. You can tell they all had a great time making this movie. The soundtrack for this movie is probably the best part about it. It made me super nostalgic. It really elevates the entire movie. The cartoon characters are their typical, zany selves, and they interact pretty well with the actors.

The one thing I absolutely cannot stand is Lola Bunny. She's the eye candy ""love interest"" for the movie, and she's generally disrespected throughout the entire movie. She tries to prove that she's no ""doll"".... until she becomes the damsel in distress character and falls for Bugs Bunny, who comes to save the day. The same Bugs Bunny that she wouldn't give the time of day to in the beginning of the movie. I dislike her entire narrative.

Other than Lola, I think the movie is pretty good. My daughter loves it, and has asked to re-watch the ""basketball movie"" a few times now.",1470787200,3,1243,4.544642857142857

One thing that was great about this movie was its blend of live action and animation.  The looney tunes characters really stress the show in this one.  Wayne Knight great and Bill Murray are also great comedic additions to the story.

This is a classic family movie that is still fun today.  I have watched this one many times and still find it funny. I recommend this one if you haven't seen it yet.",1469059200,2,663,4.093023255813954

7149837,1,B00WRNGTRG,"Pros: I think it will appeal to children with short attention spans. Bill Murray is funny sometimes. Cons: It may contribute to children having short attention spans. Bugs Bunnys personality is nowhere to be found. It is produced by Michael Jordans agent and it definitely has the spotlight on his client. His Airness wins big over His Hareness. Its overly commercial. Not only does the film showcase Mike, but also many of the products he endorses. The Looney Tunes characters have become butt-obsessed. If only they would stay away from people from Mount Moron. The film was inspired by a Nike commercial, and it should have stayed a Nike commercial.",1448236800,2,652,4.9363636363636365

7149886,5,B00WRNGTRG,"This was entirely a nostalgia watch and it delivered. The film's age mostly shows in the which NBA stars get featured, but it was worth it to see that Charles Barkley's acting hasn't improved in 20 years. As a kids movie you don't have to think too hard, and most of the subplots don't have enough time for rich character development, but that's partially the point. It's the Looney Toons. We know what we're getting. This film really does mark the one halfway decent Looney Toons feature film adaptation in the last two decades. For children of the 80's and 90's, the films referential humor lands. For people not old enough to snarl ""Newman!"" at Wayne Knight, too young to know the difference between Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, or simply too young to know what Jordan's foray into baseball and subsequent return meant to the Bulls, then the movie will seem like strangely absurd hero worship, which it entirely is. But at least it's funny and well done.",1447632000,,957,4.668639053254438

The story of how Bilbo gained the courage to fly his way up the mountain on his Starship Melennium Enterprise to challenge the guards to a intense  game of pin the tail on the donkey. It was sad the way his sidekick was taken from him by falling into interstellar inception space in his Tackeyon Amplifier.

Nice to see players of a bygone NBA era.  While rivalries existed, but without the Drama, and Baby Prima donna's of today.  Nice to seem MJ, Patrick, Shawn, Mugsy, Charles while still within the prime years.

Easy to follow conflict/resolution story-line. Suitable for just about all kids.

Pros:
- Good, Clean Family Fun
- a Nice blast from the past with the NBA players involved
- No need to keep finger on the remote to mute out obnoxious language

Cons:
- None to speak of",1444953600,,616,4.5963302752293576

8 Year Old review:
Oh my goodness! This movie is amazing! This is what I really want to do in the future. Be like Michael and play a game with bugs and daffy and everybody else. This is my future and I won't change it at all! 5/5

22 Year Old Review:
What can I say? After 14 years, my ""dreams"" never came true. Sorry, off topic.
Space Jam take place around the time where Michael decided that it was time to retire from the sport that is basketball. After a long career, he turns his eyes on baseball. Aliens from Moron Mountain needed a new attraction to keep customers coming, so they figure a logical thing to do is kidnap a popular group called the loony tunes. Upon arrival, they aren't taken seriously until a gun fries Yosemite Sam. Bugs and his partners challenge them to a game of basketball do a rule that ""they must be given a chance to defend themself"". The small aliens don't know what the game is, so they're shown a short clip on what the game is and the basic rules. Upon learning that it's played in real life earth, the aliens go there and steal the talents of 5 NBA players. When ""warming up"" for the big game, the toon squad are in fear when the aliens get all big and buffed. Fearing for what might happen to them, they kidnap Michael while playing golf by making him a hole-in-one. They plea with him to play, but Michael insists that he plays baseball. After seeing the competition, he agrees to play, but has no gear to practice with. So bugs and daffy go to his home and grab it. Game day comes, and the toons have a rough time in the 1st half. After drinking some water, or shall we say ""Michael's secret stuff"", they play like a boss the second half to win freedom. Micheal goes back to give the talents back to the 5 NBA players and then he, himself, comes out of retirement play some more.
The only real thing that I would have to complain about this movie is that I would like to see both squads practicing for the game. I would like to check out what they did in order to prepare for this big moment.
Very solid movie, would watch over and over again.",1442448000,2,2291,4.360655737704918

7150383,4,B00WRNGTRG,"While I will grant that Space Jam will never be considered an all-time critically acclaimed movie, it really is just a harmless use of an hour and a half. These alien creatures from Moron Mountain steal the talent of NBA players in an effort to enslave the roster of Looney Tunes for work on their failing amusement park. Our favorite Looney Tunes characters enlist the services of a retired Michael Jordan for a basketball game to decide it all.

Its very light, free, and easy without a lot of deep subplots and pulse racing drama. In all honesty, when I was in fourth grade I loved this movie and thought it was the greatest thing ever, well that and Twister. I have to wonder if my review is being tinted by the good memories that the movie generates rather than actual quality.  But that is perhaps the best thing about movies in general. We can base our opinions on our emotions and feelings and probably should because if a movie just exists, then it hasn't done its job as an art form. I like Space Jam for the fact that it allows me to escape from the adult world and feel like a kid again, if only for a few brief moments.",1441324800,,1132,4.334905660377358

7150547,5,B00WRNGTRG,As a kid I always enjoyed watching this movie. So once son showed he enjoyed watching Rocky and Bullwinkle where they are cartoons but everyone else is human. So we decided to get him Space Jam. While it's not his favorite movie he does enjoy watching it from time to time. You really can't get more classic than the looney tunes and their humor is great for all ages.,1440201600,,368,4.3478260869565215

7150550,5,B00WRNGTRG,Great Movie!,1440115200,,12,5.5
7150551,2,B00WRNGTRG,"Maybe I am a traitor to my generation but this movie has really not aged well. Considering the budget ($80 million! though much of this is probably Michael Jordan and co's salaries) I am surprised how inconsistent the animation quality is. At some points where the characters are interacting with MJ the look is seamless and looks gorgeous but in some of the action sequences everything looks rushed. I know this movie was made at the dawn of CGI but what puts this in perspective is that Toy Story came out the previous year in 1995 with a much smaller budget. While Toy Story's animation still holds up and looks only somewhat dated, Space Jam's is very lackluster in comparison.

Also, the plot is absolutely paper-thin. When MJ appears to help the toons train for their big basketball game, they literally only ""train"" for one day before they have to play the bad guys. I love a good training montage as much as anyone else; would it have killed them to maybe spend a little more time actually training for this game? The toons clearly have only asked Michael to come help them win the game for them as opposed to working with them. What I'm talking away from this movie is that it only existed to stroke Michael Jordan's ego. The first time I saw SJ it was so exciting to see the biggest figure in the history of sports playing basketball with iconic cartoon characters. Now, it's just a sad commentary on how excessive and tasteless much of the 90's culture was. One of the only fun parts of the movie is seeing Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, etc. in their respective primes pretending to be completely inept. It is truly awesome.

In addition, can we talk about how Bill Murray is in this movie for less than 10 minutes? If we all have one take away from Space Jam it's that the lack of Bill Murray is absolutely inexcusable. I can only rate this two stars because we don't get enough screen time with the best Ghostbuster.",1440115200,,1946,4.5413105413105415

Sure, I had to explain who all the famous basketball players were, but the silliness of Bugs Bunny and Co. and the classic tale of the underdogs miraculously defeating the stronger team wasn't lost to them (not to mention a great soundtrack). This is a fun movie for younger kids and those of us born in the mid-late 80's. It was really nice to share a small piece of my childhood with my own kids.",1439769600,4,687,4.251908396946565

7150727,5,B00WRNGTRG,"I LOVE THIS QUIRKY MOVIE

I've always been a sucked for this movie. It's completely goofy, but it works. The live action blends seamlessly with the animation.

It's funny. It's got Bill Murray cameos, so I don't know what else you need. I mean Bill Murray doing scenes with Daffy Duck....if you can't have a good time watching that you're just not trying.

And there is something about Marvin the Martian being the referee for the basketball game that always cracked me up, like Marvin had to be a neutral party because he's both a Looney Toon and an alien. The whole movie is just well thought out that way.",1438819200,,608,4.509090909090909

They could have put better and cooler special features on here. The ones they decided to include are boring and really don't warrent the special edition tag. Only thing good was the behind the scenes featurrette that was made back in the day before or after the movie came out, that was cool and nice to see.

7150870,5,B00WRNGTRG,"A bit retro but very entertaining.  I was very pleased to find out that Bill Murray is a legitimate basketball player, not just comic relief.  Although, I must say, he is some pretty amazing comic relief.
The animation was fun and entertaining.  Not state of the art today but it was when it was made.  Keep in mind this movie came out almost two decades ago.
The story was cute, silly, exciting, and fun.
This is definitely a kids movie, or for those of us who are kids at heart.

Plot:
Aliens arrive to steal the talent from top NBA players so they can make lots of space money.  Michael Jordan enlists the help of cartoon characters to steal back their talent.  Fun ensues.",1437523200,,676,4.403225806451613

I don't believe in coincidences; every person is placed on this earth to fulfill a specific purpose. Before being able to star in this masterpiece, Michael Jordan had to first get cut from this high school basketball team, vow to become the best player in the world, make over 100 free throws per practice, win the NCAA championship, then three-peat NBA championships, then try to play baseball, then come back to make this awesome movie in the middle of his second three-peat. MJ had to have all these things happen for Space Jam to exist, which is arguably better than his entire NBA career, because a) it has Bugs Bunny, and b) it has Bill Murray.",1437436800,,750,4.522058823529412

7151087,4,B00WRNGTRG,"Although the film does not follow the traditional depictions of Bugs Bunny, & his fellow Looney Tunes cartoon characters, Space Jam is never the less a very enjoyable rated G family level film.  The great Michael Jordan, Bill Murray, and Bugs Bunny together is a fun & entertaining trio.

 The people have panned this film were upset over the depictions of the Looney Tunes franchise not following it's more intelligent, and sly comedic themes as they had many years ago, but that does not necessarily mean that this is a bad film nor an enjoyable cartoon mixed with reality experience.  Similar to Roger Rabbit with the late Bob Hoskins & actor Christopher Lyod ""Back to the Future & Star Trek"", ""Space Jam"" is presented in a world where real actors interact with cartoon fantasy creatures.

 Basketball legend Michael Jordan is recruited by Bugs Bunny & friends to stop a plot of Basketball themed aliens from taking over the Earth, and running a scam theme park. The good guys have to play in a cosmic NBA game against the villains for the Earth's future.

 The movie has some of the best pop songs of the 90's from artist like Monica, ""For you I will"", Seal with his remake of ""Fly like an Eagle"", & R. Kelly's ""I believe I can fly"".

 This time we also find Bugs has a girlfriend with a newer female Bunny character.

 Actors from other movies such as ""Jurassic Park"", along with the voice of Danny De Vito are featured in the movie.  If you want light cartoon kid level entertainment then ""Space Jam"" may work for your interests.  It is not a great movie nor is it ""Academy Award"" level material, but I will give it two thumbs up & a B-.  I would rate this G for all ages.",1426291200,,1678,4.473684210526316

7151113,5,B00WRNGTRG,"I cant say enough good about Space Jam because its a classic, but most people don't seem to regard it as such because unless they grew up watching it they cant see past the silly premise. And truthfully, the premise of Space Jam IS very silly. Who would have thought a basketball movie with Michael Jordan and all the Looney Tunes would make something so entertaining?

The very idea of the movie was inspired by old television commercials Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny used to share that advertised sneakers and such. Somehow, the famous comedy film producer and director, Ivan Reitman, became inspired enough to do a feature length movie about these two. Space Jam tells the story of Michael Jordans real-life change from a basketball player to a baseball player. Although he believes he has no inspiration left in him its up to the Looney Tunes to help him rekindle his passion for his true sport before the movies over.

Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and the other Tunes happen to live underground in another world that humans are unaware of. Five goofy looking aliens from an alien theme part have been ordered by their boss to invade this cartoon world so they can imprison the Looney Tunes and make them into an attraction. The Tunes are cocky enough to believe they can beat the aliens at a game of basketball in exchange for their freedom, but things take a turn for the worst when the aliens successfully rob real-life basketball players of their talents so they can transform themselves into hard shooting basketball monsters! With no other choice, Bugs and the others think it a good idea to recruit Michael Jordan so they can play this game and win their freedom.

Despite the storys very silly set up, Space Jam is a very down-to-earth movie with a lot of heart and passion going for it. The biggest challenge this movie faces is how it combines live-action humans with animated cartoon characters. The audience can actually relate to Michael Jordan and the other human characters despite the animation, which was no small feat. The Looney Tunes even manage to snag our emotional investment because this movie doesnt downplay the serious conflict they have to overcome. This combination was done successfully only once before in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

The story is ultimately a tribute to two things. Basketball and the Looney Tunes. I am not personally a fan of Basketball, but I recommend you at least be a Looney Tunes fan to enjoy this movie. Whether you like the sport or not doesnt distract from the enjoyability of this movie. But the all-star cast of real-life basketball players (besides MJ of course) is quite impressive. The basketball playing itself has just enough realism behind it to make us appreciate it as a game, and not just comedic possibility. Most of the movie is animated, but it is the most top notch animation of its time and it still hold up pretty well to this day. This also being the first feature-length movie to have all the Looney Tunes, its a fitting tribute with all the cameo appearances and slapstick humor thats true to the old formula.

Space Jam really is a freaky movie, because it was done so well and it hasn't aged in the least. How? Maybe because it came out at the right time, during the 90s when kids movies were still campy and they were not all big-budget blockbusters. This movie still makes us cheer with excitement and shed a tear of hope because no other movie has since done it quite the same way Space Jam has. Of course, the soundtrack definitely helps. With songs like Fly Like an Eagle and Monstars Anthem, there is a lot to be excited over. Of course, no song can come close to the magnificence of I Believe I Can Fly. This is the one song Disney can never hope to top, because its pure inspiration and hope. Its a wonder how Space Jam got ahold of such a song, but its a song that will never be disconnected from this movie, and with good reason.

Space Jam is a film that somehow managed to take this silly idea of a movie and turn it into something kids still want to see after they grow up. I know, because Im one of them. Other bad movies start off as silly but never reached their potential because Space Jam is one of those rare movies where the passion shines through and sticks with everyone who was young enough to enjoy it at the time. So whether you're a Michael Jordan fan or a Looney Tunes fan, this is a movie for the ages.",1423699200,,4419,4.55919395465995

Needless today say, this movie helped shape my life.  Watching this film as an ""Adult"" I can tell you that it works on two levels.  One, namely, is nostalgia.  Secondly, it's like I was watching this movie again...for the first time.  You see, I never truly appreciated Bill Murray in this film.  He is, hands down, the best part.  ALSO, I never realized that Danny DeVito was the voice of the villain.

All and all, I can say without a doubt this was the greatest gift I have been given.  And that is saying something when you consider my God-Given ability to sing, dance and bass fish.",1421107200,,721,4.313432835820896

Packaging was amazing and the disk was secure in the case, unlike when you get a DVD and it falls out and rattles and scratches before opening the seals.

If you are looking for something fun and entertaining for the whole family or the kids to watch this will fit the bill.  We did pizza and a movie and this was the selection.  My kids 4 and 5 enjoyed it immensely and my husband and I got a kick out of it too as there were several well known celebrities sprinkled throughout the film with funny bits and lines.

7151248,3,B00WRNGTRG,"It's okay.  I don't have too much to say about this flim.  It was made for kids, and for kids who are sports fans,  Ink out of the well formula is put through some tests as Air Jordan does his thing on the big screen with WB's finest.  There's a couple of plot holes, Bill Murry doesn't do a whole lot, but he's entertaining enough.  I could have written a better script with better gags, using the same premise.  The flim's dated now because of the use of what was truly the golden age of Basketball (late 70s up through the late 90s).

An okay film.  Doesn't deliver many laughs in the toon department.  Check it out if you got nothing else to watch.",1414281600,,652,4.193548387096774

This is the kind of movie that only people who bought Howard the Duck and Roger Rabbit could applaud.  Frankly, even THEY think this movie is corny.

7151391,5,B00WRNGTRG,"Space Jam is a family live-action and animated sports comedy film that features Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters. The story is about how the Looney Tunes gang seek the help of Jordan in a basketball game against a group of outer space creatures,who plans to kidnap them in order to provide an added attraction for a failing intergalactic amusement park. Despite having a simple and predictable story,it can still be enjoyed by kids and adults alike as we get to see a mix of animated action,sports and comedy.

7151441,4,B00WRNGTRG,"I've heard plenty of bad things about ""Space Jam"", but personally, I think it's a pretty fun movie to watch. True, Michael Jordan is no Laurence Olivier, but he's definitely a better actor as himself than Shaq is as a rapping genie. The classic Looney Tunes characters are just as 'looney' as you'd hope to expect, and their voice actors (all FIVE of them, which is weird since they were all originally voiced by ONE man, Mel Blanc) do a pretty good job with the recognizable voices of the cartoon all-stars.
However, the one thing I love about the movie is that the animation is just FANTASTIC. Not only is it very fast-paced, creative, fluid and expressive, but it also has great shading effects and blending with live-action (kinda like Roger Rabbit) which almost looks like they were filmed right on the set!
One thing that kinda bugs me (no pun intended) is that there are a little too many extreme-close ups, but that's more of a nitpick.
With great animation, looney tuney humor and the inclusion of the song ""I Believe I Can Fly"", (believe it or not) ""Space Jam"" is no masterpiece, but it's worth at least checking out once.",1403827200,2,1132,4.608910891089109

My nephew was so excited once he opened it he ran inside to watch it right away. Tried it on our DVD player, our computer, our playstation and nothing disc is blank. Probably the worst experience ever. Thanks for messing up a little kids birthday gift..!",1399680000,2,361,4.323529411764706

7151465,1,B00WRNGTRG,"The movie was great but it stopped three times while my kids were watching it.  The process to request a refund is unbelievably cumbersome that it is not worth my time to save $3.

Amazon knows when the movie stops or is having problems.  Why don't you either automatically provide a refund or make the refund process easier?

We are regular customers of Amazon's on demand videos and have only had this problem twice...but what a hassle!",1399248000,,438,4.64935064935065
7151466,5,B00WRNGTRG,"I still remember when this was released.  It was one of my first cinematic obsessions.  I saw it countless times in the theater, owned the soundtrack, knew every word to every song and every piece of dialog from the film.  Michael Jordan became my hero, and the Monstars became the coolest bad guys Id ever seen.  I would sit for hours and draw characters from the film and I basically thought of nothing else other than Space Jam for months on end.  Basketball became my life, and I hate sports.

We all grow up eventually.

Well, grow up I may have, but I still love this movie.  I may not be as obsessed (I think of other things) but the fun and spunk and cleverness of this film still shines through and has blessed a new generation with hours of enjoyment.

The film meshes our world with the world of our Looney friends when the tunes find themselves in danger of imprisonment at the hands of aliens determined to use them to boost sales at their amusement park.  Bugs challenges the aliens to a friendly game of basketball, which turns unfriendly fast when the aliens steal the basketball skills of seasoned professionals in order to give them an unfair advantage.  Feeling desperate, Bugs and his pals kidnap Michael Jordan, who has abandoned basketball for his failed career as a baseball player, and soon they have a chance to keep their freedom.

The film is hilarious and visually impressive, melding the animation with the live action perfectly, and the cast is spot on, even the sports players who get to sulk around and act talentless.  Charles Barkleys Madonna comment is also one of the best movie lines ever.

With one of the greatest soundtracks in the history of cinema (Im serious), Space Jam is pretty awesome.",1398729600,5,1732,4.636065573770492

Yes. Some of the animation was fluid and presentable, but it seriously came off as a "" Let's hype the hell out of Michael Jordon and his shoes.""
I actually stayed through the whole film. Hoping, praying it would pull through at the last minute. But no.

Space Jam, the famous 1996 live-action sports film, was directed by Joe Pytka.  The movies combination of NBA star Michael Jordan and Warner Bros.s Looney Tunes led to a box-office smash, despite mixed reviews from critics.  As a child, Space Jam was one of my favorite movies.  I can, however, understand the dismal critical response as several of the original Looney Tunes directors were disappointed with the Tunes portrayal, stating that the script was misrepresentative of the classic Looney Tunes characters.  Nit-picking aside, I still think Space Jam is among the best sports films of all time; not only is it highly entertaining, humorous, and phenomenally paced, its also inspirational and carries the theme of following your own dreams without being burdened by the expectations of others.  As an adult, I must admit that I only rarely watch Space Jam; for me, it is really just important to have the movie among my DVD collection for nostalgic purposes and because it features both the Looney Tunes and Michael Jordantwo highly relevant entities from the 90s.

SUMMARY:

Space Jam opens with an alternative depiction of Michael Jordans 1993 retirement from the National Basketball Association; during the press-conference, Jordan announces that he is leaving the NBA to play baseballthe sport Michaels father had always hoped hed playeven though Michael isn't very good at it.

Mr. Swackhammer, alien and owner of the Moron Mountain amusement park, masterminds an evil scheme to increase revenue at his park.  He plans to enslave Earths Looney Tunes and make them his newest and most lucrative attraction.  Swackhammers henchmen, the Nerdlucks, are dispatched to the secret animated world of Looney Tune Land to capture the Tunes.  Bugs Bunny, taking note of the aliens small stature, devises one of his famous ruses; Bugs challenges the Nerdlucks to play a game of basketball for the Tunes freedom.  The Nerdlucks, with no intention of letting the Tunes win, set out to steal the talent of the five greatest NBA players.  Once the Looney Tunes see that they're no longer posed to play the pip-squeak Nerdlucks, but rather the big and bad team of Monstars, they realize that, if they want to retain their freedom, they're going to need some help.

Since the greatest talents in the NBA are already commandeered, Bugs and Daffy abduct their only hope:  Michael Jordan.  Jordan is initially reluctant to join the teamexplaining that he no longer plays basketballbut once he sees what bullies the Monstars are, he commits himself to the Tune Squad.  Even with Michaels skills, the Monstars crush the Tunes in the first half.  During intermission, Bugs takes it upon himself to motivate his team in a way only Bugs Bunny can; he gives his teammates a special drink that turns the Tunes into an unstoppable force (its really just water).  With renewed morale, the Tune Squad comes back to trail the Monstars by only a single point.  After taking notice of Swackhammers frustration with the score, Michael proposes a new deal:  if the Tunes win, the Monstars will return the stolen talents to their NBA players; if the Monstars win, Swackhammer will take Michael in place of the Looney Tunes.

Now that the stakes have been raised, the Monstars play out the remainder of the game with every dirty trick in the book.  As the Tune Squads injured-list fills up, they are down to only four players and will likely have to forfeit that is, until Jordans friend and NBA-wannabe, Bill Murray, steps onto the court.  Just before the final play, Michael learns that even a humans physical limitations are different in Tune Land.  Just shy of the buzzer, Jordan leaps (in air-Jordan fashion) and extends his arm across the court to secure the winning basket.

Even though the Monstars have done terrible things on their bosss behalf, Michael feels empathy for the abuse they endure from Swackhammer.  Before returning their size and talent, the Monstars liberate themselves by stuffing Swackhammer in a rocket and send him screaming all the way to the Moon.  The movie closes with everything going back to normal; Michael returns the NBA players talents and returns his own talent to the NBA as a member of the Chicago Bulls.",1382832000,,5353,5.217543859649123

7151617,5,B00WRNGTRG,"my roommate and I have been on a bit of a nostalgia binge recently. Nintendo 64 is still awesome but Power Rangers is now one of the weirdest, worst edited and acted I've ever laid my adult eyes on (although the theme song is still rad as hell) so I got scared when Space Jam was requested.

This movie was a good percentage of my childhood. I was already well aware of the fact that both Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes were the alpha predators in their respective genres but it blew my 7 year old mind when they came together.

Coming back as a 24 year old with a good taste in movies (I will not watch any film whom Michael Bay had a hand in creating) I was not disappointed. The animation is some of the best in American cartoons (not as good as Roger Rabbit, but that's not a kid's movie), and MJ actually has on-screen chemistry with these actors who don't exist. Also, there are jokes that sailed 30 feet over my head when I was a kid such as the woman at the Knick's game saying ""This guy its doing something weird in his raincoat,""  the Elmer Fudd/Yosemite Sam Pulp Fiction reference, when the psychiatrist asks Patrick Ewing if there are any other areas where he can't ""perform,"" and Bill F-ing Murray's reason for getting into Looney Tune Land was because he ""knew the producer.""

Also, the soundtrack is probably the greatest in the history of cinema in terms of everyday listenability.",1372550400,,1402,4.422480620155039
7151618,5,B00WRNGTRG,I remember watching this movie as a child with my parents and loving it.  Michael Jordan was really and still is such a icon.  I'm glad I can share some of my childhood with my son and watching him love this movie as much as we did when we were kids. Received DVD promptly. Would purchase from this seller again.,1372032000,,312,4.183333333333334
7151619,5,B00WRNGTRG,Space Jam is one the of the greatest moives ever made.  It is wholesome and family friendly and my kids really loved it.  I think this movie is a classic.,1372032000,,154,4.1
7151620,5,B00WRNGTRG,"the acting is mostly bad, but the dialogue is awful! the plot is paper thin and really just an excuse to have a series of jokes strung together. as a Kid i adored this movie. as an adult (watching it with my son) I think I liked it more.

The memories of watching this when i was young account for most of my enjoyment. but the appearances by Wayne Knight, Danny DeVito and Bill Murray were fun because i had no idea who they were when i was young. also seeing a movie use ""I believe i can fly"" totally straight and without a hint of sarcasm, was immensely fun.

The only thing i have to say as a true positive to this move is that the special effect (Combining live action a cartoon) have held up remarkably well, and the animation is very clean and crisp.

if you have never seen this movie don't wast your time. if you are a Looney Toons fan (Mel Blonc was the king of voice acting) don't wast your time. if you in the mood for a clever family comedy don't wast your time. but if you watched this when you were a kid and you have kids of your own now, then watch this and let your children remind you what you loved about this when you were young and naive.",1372032000,,1160,4.056768558951965

7151646,5,B00WRNGTRG,"Being a Michael Jordan fan, I may be bias on this but also being a Looney Tunes fan, I can really be honest too.  This is a fun movie.  Old school fans of Looney Tunes may say nay to this movie because it may not hit to them the way the old cartoons do but for kids or parents who watch movies with their kids, this is a good mixture.  Bill Murray is in this also to add a little comedy to it, being a long time Bulls fan and friend to Michael Jordan, I figured he'd be in it anyway.  No, Michael Jordan won't win any Academy Awards for his performance but he was a lot better than you'd expect in this.  There is typical Looney Tunes action and gags that are cute and funny for everyone and sports stuff for the sports fans.  The ""Monstars"" that are there to take play the bad guys are big ugly looking monsters, I do not think they are anything scary for kids, they act goofy and tough at the same time but I think kids 5 and up would be fine with seeing them without being scared. I enjoy this movie, my daughter isn't a fan of Looney Tunes but my wife and I are, and my wife does want to watch this so hopefully we can talk my daughter into it as well.  Good family movie for a movie night in my opinion.",1366848000,,1208,3.9465020576131686

Now to watch in 1080p full high definition just brings back so many childhood memories. I would just like to say thank you to all of the looney tunes and Michael Jordan for being in this movie it is one of my favorite looney tunes movies ever.

He has always loved Looney Tunes and still does (he LOVES Pepe' Le Pew.) I like the Looney's myself. Brings back memories of watchin them in the 60's & 70's. Not even about the basketball just the fact that the Looney Tunes are in it (and Pepe' Le Pew) is why he loves it.

But anyway.. I wouldn't say that this is JUST for little kids. If your a fan of the Looneys or a fan of Michael Jordan... Your sure to like this movie! Now this is NOT a GREAT ""GROUNDBREAKING"" movie in anyway. But I don't think it was suppose to be. It's just fun & silly. It has humor for the little ones but also stuff that adults can understand. And it defiantly blows Mary Poppins out of the water! (Not that they have anything in common) just a reference since they're both live CG animation movies.

All in all if I could give it 6 stars I would! Anyone who gave this movie a rating of 2 stars or under are stupid! They can't understand good old fashion fun, with some good old fashion Looney Tunes humor! And it has Bill Murray in it. So you cant go wrong there.

GREAT - FUN MOVIE EVERYONE CAN ENJOY!",1335744000,,1205,4.0974576271186445

7151754,4,B00WRNGTRG,"***This review may contain spoilers***

  As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's ""Harlem Globetrotters"" would dribble onto the airwaves.  Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it.  Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules.  In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team.

  ""Space Jam"" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons.  Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars.  The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet.  Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom.  But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh.  Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win?

  After the critical/popular triumph of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit.  While not quite up there technically or thematically with ""Roger Rabbit"", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right.  Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball.  All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous.  The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray (""I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!"") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time.  The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars.

  SJ even has some moral uplift.  Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half.  Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep.  Bugs comes to the rescue with some ""Jordan's Secret Stuff"", a liquid that puts fire back into the team.  Later, as the ""Secret Stuff"" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!).  But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point.  Can Jordan make the winning basket?  Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!).

  SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball afficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.",1334275200,,3519,5.212121212121212

7151763,1,B00WRNGTRG,"Studio execs had just one goal in mind: combine two popular things (Looney Tunes and Micheal Jordan), no matter how disparate and unrelated they might be, and just throw them into a movie together. Heck, they've been doing it in commercials for a long time, why not a feature length film? Why indeed.

Everything else about this movie from the script to the direction flowed from that inherently flawed and nonsensical choice. And from junk comes junk. Hence, Space Junk.

I don't actually hate this movie quite as much as I sound, but it's high rating on Amazon really ticks me off. This really is not any good.",1328486400,5,612,4.657407407407407

He loves the looney toons, and eventhough he has no knowledge of who Michael Jordan is, loves him too.  The movie is good for both kids and adults and I have enjoyed watching it again with him.  Kids will enjoy the humor by Bugs, Daffy, and all the other characters.  Adults will like the 90's themed jokes as well as the cameos by Bill Murray, Larry Bird, and the other NBA stars that we grew up with.

7151824,4,B00WRNGTRG,"Who would have thought that Looney Tunes and Basketball would be a pretty good mix? Bugs and Daffy and friends are about to be taken as slaves for Mister Swackhammer, the proprietor for Moron Mountain. They must defeat Swackhammer's tiny minions with a game of basketball. This would be easier than expected (seeing that it was Bugs and his friends' idea in the first place), but the minions have stolen the talents of Basketball all-stars (including Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley) and have become the ""Monstars""! They are now stronger and bigger than they were before. So now, the Looney Tunes have only one hope: Michael Jordan. And what you get is 88 minutes of good ol' hilarity, with slapstick humor that's almost equal to the original animated Looney shorts.

This is a very entertaining movie. It has Bugs, Sylvester, and Daffy playing basketball with M.J., which is a pretty memorable concept. The reason why I've given this film four stars instead of five is because of Lola Bunny. She was a very unnecessary addition to the Looney Tunes. She's not funny, she's irritating, and she tries too hard to look attractive. Another reason is Michael Jordan's acting. It's very wooden at times, but he's not as bad as Shaq (I think you know which movie I'm talking about). But everything else is just fine. Wayne Knight and Bill Murray are pretty funny in their supporting roles. But the real stars here are, of course, the Looney Tunes. I'm pretty sure that fans of Bugs, Yosemite Sam, Tweety, and Marvin the Martian will get a kick out of this movie. It's fun for both families and Looney Tunes fans.",1255305600,2,1607,4.759856630824372

He has watched it a few times since he got it mostly when his friends are over.

7151836,5,B00WRNGTRG,"Space Jam as a movie has always held a special place in my heart. Being 12 years old as of this review, I have to say this movie has aged really well. Starring a real comic legend in Bill Murray and an acting great, Danny DeVito doing a voice over; this movie was destined to succeed. The real surprise for everyone was the performance of Michael Jordan. Although not exactly Sidney Poitier he did his job of being the face of this movie and when you make a movie with basketball as the main focus, you couldn't not have Michael Jordan.

The story goes that aliens from a theme park world named Moron Mountain, need a new attraction. Whilst throwing around ideas the evil boss, Mr. Swackhammer decides that he must get the Looney Tunes. He sends his cronies to Looney Tune land and get the Looney Tunes; whether they want to or not. The tunes not willing to go quietly challenge the aliens to a game of basketball in which, if they lose they have to work at Moron Mountain. Forever. Before the game, the alien team become known as the Monstars and they steal the basketball abilities of some of the greatest players in the NBA. The Looney Tunes know that the only way they can win this game is to kidnap Michael Jordan and have him play on their side.

This is a genuinely fun movie that is good to entertain the whole family. The effects aren't groundbreaking, but to see the Looney Tunes in a new adventure gives us some great nostalgia. Like I said, Michael Jordan isn't made to be an actor and it's shown in this movie. If you're one to go into every movie and criticise acting ability then I would suggest you leave your brain at the door for this one. An overall great movie that all the family can enjoy.",1217980800,,1711,4.360501567398119
7151837,3,B00WRNGTRG,"Why didn't they animate Michael Jordon? He's a block of wood.

7151857,3,B00WRNGTRG,"""Space Jam"" was the first feature-length film with the Looney Tunes characters...or was it a kid's-eye view of the Michael Jordan-era NBA? This mid-'90s release, made when computer animation was new, still seems more than a bit dated. That said, it's a modestly amusing live-action/animated movie, revolving around Jordan's two-year baseball ""sabbatical"" and his adventures with the ""Tune Squad"", the world's most unusual basketball team. More a marketing-based pastiche than a story, ""Space Jam"" has some good sequences (Mr. Swackhammer, a green-slime, cigar-chomping carny boss, and his mini-monster employees; a clever golf bit with Jordan, Larry Bird, and Bill Murray in his ""Caddyshack"" garb; Bugs and Daffy sneaking into MJ's house) and some bad ones (Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley losing their power, the toons at practice). As for the basketball game between the Tunes and the no-longer-mini ""Mon-stars"", it shows some imagination, especially with Hubie and Bertie the mice as P.A. announcers and the final-play sequence involving Murray as a walk-on. I suppose this looked like a slam dunk on release, given how huge Jordan was in the '90s and a time when classic Looney Tunes weren't too easy to find. The animation isn't too slick and some of the jokes are flat, but ""Space Jam"" is still watchable- a lay-up, if you will. Some of the extras, however, are great, notably the four newer Looney Tunes on Disc 2. An aging Chuck Jones gamely reprises his classic ""One Froggy Evening"" storyline on ""Another Froggy Evening""; the Roman ""Saladus Caesar"" bit is good. The others, created by Greg Ford, come very close to the originals in humor and timing, especially ""Night Of The Living Duck""- see Daffy croon in an all-monster nightclub, dubbed by, of all people, the late Mel Torme! There's also an extended ""Bugs and Daffy's Video Stars""- overlong, badly mixed at times, but still a collection of old-school (and very old-school) Warner musical clips going back to the '20s. Overall, if you're a Looney Tunes completist or old Jordan fan, you'll probably like this a little. But I'd go with the ""Back In Action"" movie, which at least is more original and genuinely funny in spots. Of course, the fabulous

""Golden Collection"" sets are the greatest...that's all, folks!",1122076800,6,2277,5.120967741935484

The premise involves a theme part from another planet that wants to capture the ""toons"" to bring in more customers.

The aliens manage to steal the talent of NBA stars and grow to huge proportions. The toons need help so Michael Jordan is drafted from his baseball career to save the day.

I am also not happy about the special featueres on the 2 disc special edition DVD. In 'Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers' all the scenes with Yosemiti Sam are editied out and I wonder why. Are all youngsteres going to copy a pint sized cowboy shooting guns and smoking ETC?

7151862,5,B00WRNGTRG,"This movie was well made despite its' obvious crudeness. Yes, I would agree that the charactors are pale immitations of the old Looney Tunes charactors and of course the acting by the Ball players (yes, even Bill was just as bad or worse, despite his so-called ""name""). The voices was probably like listening to AL Yankovic-type impersonations compared to the old ""Tunes"" voices. Most of the ""critically acclaimed"" movies are only hype anyway so, why attack this movie?? Rediculous.

This movie was very entertaining. You have these jealous idiots that hate the fact that Michael Jordan is cast in the film. So what?? Get over it. One idiot was talking about his popularity outside of the US as if it has anything to do with it. The guy is known outside of the US from this movie and the produts he endorses as well as those who follow American basketball. And, Yes, he's known ""moreso"" today. You MJ bashers are just plain jealous and stupid.

Yes, this film was still VERY entertaining and inspirational.  I've seen less entertaining and inspiring films get Oscar / Acadamy Award wins and nominations. I wouldn't normally write a review such as this but, these people talk about this film as something personal that has been done to them.

7151863,3,B00WRNGTRG,"When I saw this at the cinema all those years ago I was very disappointed. The real stars were playing second-banana to a sports personality, the characters weren't really acting like themselves and the plot was pretty predictable.

I only bought this DVD because Looney Tunes : Back in Action gave me a wish to revisit and I'm quite glad I did.

Although I still wish that the toons were made more of, I now have Back in Action to make up for that. The toon's characters are still pretty far from their classic versions but it works in the context of the film and isn't that bad. I like Lola Bunny who has only seemed to have surfaced on the odd piece of merchandise ever since - I think she deserves a fully paid membership into the Looney Tunes gang. The plot is still predictable but it is also fun.

I was surprised to see that although Michael Jordan can't really act, he has enough personality and presense to carry his parts of the movie and the script has some excellent gags although they are few and far between ('What kind of Mickey Mouse organisation calls their team The Ducks?').

As you may note, I am from Great Britain and I was very disappointed to see the amount of extras on the region one version of this DVD that we in region 2 haven't got.  Not for us a commentary or the 4 recently produced shorts (two of which I've never seen). All we get is the trailer, the very poor Jammin' doc (made at the time and total fluff) and the Bugs vs. Daffy TV special that is great but of very poor picture and sound quality - no clean-up here! It's tempting to buy the region 1 version just for 'Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers' and 'Another Froggy Evening' - maybe they'll turn up on the next excellent Looney Tunes DVD compilation.

This film is definately worth a visit if you are a Jordan or basketball fan. If you're a Looney Tune fan - visit this film via Back in Action.",1108512000,,1887,4.31638418079096

I bought the dvd immediately and was greatly dissapointed by the fact that it is the censored and cut version!  HOLY COW!  Warner Bros!  How could you do this?!  ""Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers"" is amazing and you happened to transfer the version in which Yosemite Sam is completely cut out from the cartoon?

7151865,5,B00WRNGTRG,"SPACE JAM is now available as a deluxe 2-DVD set, and it's
about time! Drastically misunderstood and ridiculously
panned, Joe Pytka's madcap hook-up of Bugs Bunny,
Michael Jordan, and the wackiest basketball game in
film history is really a gem of a charming folktale,
playfully letting the viewer in on ""the real reason""
for Jordan's 1st return to the game that he has
mastered so well.
It's unfortunate that so many apparently have some
serious problems dealing with an African American
celebrity respectfully placed in a Fantasy situation.
Nevertheless, the film is a load of laughs, with
some wicked satirical pokes at several of the  NBA's
most testosterone-happy superstars, suddenly
deprived of their professional manhood!
Check the scene with macho-man Charles Barkley
getting a serious dose of comeuppance from a girl's
team on a playground court! Whether you know the
sport or not, the scene is a riot!

For all the disdain that this film has gotten for being
an apparent boardroom idea, SPACE JAM itself is
a well-made film, with a solid story cleanly told.
Jordan  -in being smart enough not to play anyone
but himself- comes off very warm and highly
personable. Too, for one who's not a professional
actor, he works remarkably well, considering that
cartoon characters that he's with onscreen had to
be put in (via computer and traditional animation)
long after his performance. All in all, Jordan
copes with the camera far more competently than
one would have reason to expect.
Truth to tell, Shaq could learn a thing or two
regarding underplaying here!

As for Bugs and company, they receive the royal
treatment in a tale which places the freewheeling
Looney Tunes at odds with the terror which has
dogged their trail from their conception: corporate
disrespect, and commercial belittlement.
Their solution is a bizarrely logical melange
of live performers and fleshed-out cartoon
characters hitting the hoops with all the zeal
of a Globetrotters gig, and twice the crazy
antics to run through!
Between a sterling job bringing the Warner
Bros. characters to full-dimensional wit and
performance, guest shots from Theresa Randle,
Bill Murray, and Wayne Knight, a lunatic
nemesis voiced by Danny DeVito and a
heap of NBA players having a good ol' time
getting zapped, seanced, or pulled down
the daddy of all rabbit holes, SPACE
JAM is one great ride.
Add to all this a sleek new character
in the form of Lola Bunny, and some
serious Carl Stalling-inspired symphonic
scoring from the superb James Newton
Howard, and the sum result is easily the
finest achievement in this mode of
storytelling since WHO FRAMED ROGER
RABBIT.

Certainly, JAM's rollicking big-hearted
mythos is far and away superior to the
cardboard narrative of the more recent
LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION, where
live performers as capable as Brendan
Fraser, Timothy Dalton, and Steve
Martin were pathetically hemmed-in
by a bland storyline and cheesy
characterizations which were thinner,
and more non-dimensional than the
Toons themselves!
With BACK IN ACTION, someone
missed the point. The LOONEY
TUNES never left the building.
Or the scene.

A wild hare,
searching for Air.
Viewer, be fair!

Try SPACE JAM!

You might have
some fun.",1095292800,14,3215,5.098859315589354
7151866,2,B00WRNGTRG,"How any critic can call Looney Tunes: Back in Action an exercise in franchise promotion but not puke at the 80-minute commercial that is Space Jam is beyond me.
Our plot has Danny Devito play the voice of an evil, monster type businessman who's theme park is failing. In desperation he sends 5 little creatures to capture the Looney Tunes and bring them back as the new attraction.
So...where is Looney Tune land? Apparently it's underground. And digging up any golf ball hole will eventually lead to it. When the Looney Tunes challenge the would-be kidnappers to a basketball game they kidnap Michael Jordan to be on their team.
The quality of the film nosedives from here on. Jordan's acting is so wooden it's mahogany. He expresses no confusion, joy or surprise at being yanked into Looney Tune land and confronted by all the toons. 'Bugs Bunny you're a cartoon you're not real', he says in the most flat, boring and dullest way (missing commas intended as he doesn't use them).
And then the big game follows. Once it's over, and there's no reason left to continue watching, the film goes on for another 10 minutes (to beef the running time up 'feature length') with the basketball/Jordan story. It's rubbish.
It's no surprise that the film is directed by Joe Pytka (he's NOT Joe Dante that's for sure), a man who has never done any other features but over a 1000 TV ads, or something. Space Jam is nowt but 100% proof Warner like to whore out their most famous creation to make a few quick, and cheap, bucks. It's heartbreaking, heinous stuff.
Casting Michael Jordan alongside the Looney Tunes is not inspired and imaginative. It's crass and desperate. Now they can attract sports fans AND kiddies. And Michael Jordan of all people! He's not a good actor and his fame outside of the U.S. is minimal to say the least. Moreso today.
The only part of the film that comes (very, very remotely) close to the true spirit of the Looney Tunes is the score. James Newton Howard (a truly bizarre choice, how about Jerry Goldsmith, Bruce Broughton or even Danny Elfman) recognizes the classic Looney Tunes themes and uses them appropriately in certain moments but the rest of the score is generic and uninspired.
Back in Action was intelligent, witty and satirical. Space Jam is corny, cheap and classless. It's an absolute travesty. How can we honestly take seriously a movie that has every cast member awe at Michael Jordan, has not too subtle product placement for McDonalds and has the Looney Tunes (one of the most ingenious creations in history) exploited in the most shameless and guilt free manner. With Space Jam, Warner showed that they'd cash in the Looney Tunes at a pawn shop for $5 if they could. A total lack of respect for Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson.
And they don't even act Looney. The only laughs come from Bugs and Daffy. And it's sporadic and inconsistent. Producer Ivan Reitman (who has no experience and no business with this franchise) managed to convince Bill Murray to appear in this drek (for about 10 minutes) so the trailer could boast an ACTUAL star other than Jordan. Murray's performance is the bare minimum and has a let's-get-this-over-with feel (though Murray working below-par is still miles ahead of many other actors at the top of their game). His appearance in the film is massively oversold.
It's just not fair that THIS is a big hit while Back In Action flopped horribly. I consider it the biggest miscarriage in justice ever. I still blame the marketing for Back in Action. It was bad, REAL bad. But still has some sort of quiet dignity about it when compared to the McDonalds promoted, in your face junk that was Space Jam's marketing. Is it any wonder Joe Dante had Back In Action nicknamed 'The Anti-Space Jam movie'?
And just what the hell is a Space Jam anyway? It's not even set in Space!!!
It took Warner 3 tries but the finally released the movie in its original aspect ratio. The DVD presents the film is 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with pretty active Dolby 5.1 sound.

To add to this great era in NBA history is a really quirky but absolutely entertaining movie that is called ""Space Jam"" which brings the NBA legend Michael Jordan onto the big screen for the first and only time as of writing this review.
  In the case of this, Michael Jordan plays himself but as a golfer with a peaceful life with his family. However, his peaceful life is suddenly interrupted when he is pulled through a golf hole while trying to retrieve the golf ball and finds himself in the world of Looney Tunes. The characters from The Looney Tunes are in grave danger. A gang of vicious cartoon aliens from outer space have taken over the cartoon world and the Looney Tunes, striking a deal with them, decides that their fate will be decided through challenging the aliens to a basketball game. If they lose this game, the Looney Tunes are doomed to becoming slaves to the alien race for the rest of their lives by telling the same jokes every night to entertain their race. Realizing what's at stake for them, Elmer Fudd, Bugs Bunny, Sylvester, Tweety Bird, Pudgy Pig, Tasmania and the remaining Looney Tunes cartoon characters call on the aid of Michael Jordan to challenge the aliens to this basketball game. The aliens make things a lot more complicated when they steal the basketball skills away from several `real life' NBA basketball players rendering the players almost inept at NBA games and the aliens grow from mere small annoying creatures into gigantic troll-like beings who call themselves the ""Monstars"" as a basketball team and the newly grown aliens are just about experts at basketball due to them draining all the skills away from the `real life' NBA basketball players. It's a lot at stake as the Looney Tunes are far disadvantaged against the formidable ""Monstars"" basketball team. With the help of Michael Jordan and cameo appearances from Wayne Knight, and Bill Murray, the basketball game will decide the fate of the cartoon world's future.
 ""Space Jam"" I think is one of the most brilliant movies that came out around this time (Around in 1996) during the Chicago Bulls at their heights in the history of the NBA and ""Space Jam"" blends the glory of this time and combines it with the Cartoon World in the greatest live/cartoon hybrid movie since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" from eight years before then. This may have been Michael Jordan's only stab at acting in movies (at least at the time of writing this review) but Jordan was absolutely amazing in this movie and showed that he was absolutely capable of great acting. I also loved seeing ""Seinfeld"" actor Wayne Knight also play for the Looney Tunes basketball team against the ""Monsters"" team as well.
My favorite of the Looney Tunes were Bug Bunny and Tasmania whose eccentric cartoon characters really added so much fun, and humor to the movie. Bugs Bunny was so funny and witty and Tasmania's sometimes feral personality was absolutely a riot. I actually didn't care much for Lola Bunny a whole lot. The movie went on to become a smash hit and deservedly so because it's one of the best movies of the mid to late 1990s. I haven't been a major fan of the Looney Tunes on a historic note either except for Tom and Jerry but man, even the Looney Tunes characters were absolutely a riot in this movie. If you can, I would also recommend the soundtrack to this movie as well as it has all the fun that the movie itself has, and this is taking into account that while I have had a very intense dislike for most modern day rap music, the rap on the soundtrack is fun and excellent. Man do I wish there was another movie that blended cartoon styles with live action movie footage the way ""Space Jam"" did but at least where it stands, ""Space Jam"" is up there with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" as the best live/cartoon hybrid movie of all time.
 If you can find it, I say get a hold on the 2-disc collector's ""Special Edition"" as the edition carries a lot of cool extras on it and has much better sound and visual quality than the VHS edition. I've watched the VHS version countless times and wore it out as a result a long time ago and went for years without seeing it so I replaced it with the ""Special Edition"" DVD and let me say, it's worth every penny. If you love basketball-themed movies, then this is the movie for you but anyone who wants loads of fun and entertainment along with intelligence, wit and smart craftsmanship will find much on ""Space Jam"".",1078012800,,4681,4.595693779904306
7151869,4,B00WRNGTRG,"The new ""Space Jam"" 2-Disc DVD is a fun addition to any Looney Tunes or family DVD collection.
Disc One features the film, which can be enjoyed with commentary from the director, as well as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.  Most DVD commentaries are a bore to sit through--and this one does have its over technical moments (especially if you have young children who ""believe in"" Bugs or Daffy), but the comments from the characters are very witty--including a jab that Bugs throws at Michael Jordan early in the presentation (concerning his brief baseball career).
Rounding out the first disc is the theatrical trailer of the film (this is almost a MUST with me for any DVD).
The Second Disc is a nice bonus and could have easily been packaged as a stand-alone item.  It features a ""Making of Space Jam"" and several Looney Tunes shorts (from the 1980's and 1990's), as well as the 1988 television special, ""Bugs vs. Daffy:  Battle of the Music Video Stars"".  Speaking of music videos, the second disc also features ""Fly Like an Eagle"" and ""Monstars Anthem"".
This is a great gift for any Looney Tunes fan.  Folks who liked it as children in 1996 (when the film was released) should still like it as teens.  Children who have never seen it will also enjoy it. In short, it's a keeper.",1067385600,20,1276,4.599118942731278
7151870,5,B00WRNGTRG,This movie and Who Framed Roger Rabbit are the best Movies of this nature. The Looney Tunes and Michael Jordan (the best ball player since Allen Iverson) playing basket ball? IT DONT GET NO BETTER THAN THAT. Michael Jordan cant really act in my opinion but those basket ball scenes and the looney tunes classic stunts make up for that. You'll love it. Just for the fact that the worlds funniest cartoons and biggest ball player are in the movie. Get it just for those reasons alone.,1059436800,,482,4.551724137931035

7151872,4,B00WRNGTRG,"Space Jam teams up His Airness, Michael Jordan, with His Hareness, Bugs Bunny, for a fun, and funny, family film.
Michael Jordan has retired from basketball, and currently playing baseball, when Bugs Bunny and his Looney Tunes pals ask for his help in playing a b-ball game against diminuative aliens from Moron Mountain. These aliens have stolen the talent of 5 NBA players, including Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing, and are now larger than life. Since this is Looney Tunes Land, this game is NOT your average basketball game. If it was, it wouldn't be any fun.
Though not an actor of any kind in anyone's book, Michael Jordan does a very good job of interacting with his cartoon co-stars. Most of the jokes are well done and the basketball game itself is a lot of fun. In addition, it is quite funny to watch the 5 NBA players that had their ""games"" stolen trying to cope with their newfound ordinaryness.
This movie is not groundbreaking by any means and most all of the original Looney Tunes cartoons are better. But this movie never tries to be more than it is: a good time. And at that, it succeeds very well.",1039737600,54,1118,4.567164179104478
7151873,5,B00WRNGTRG,"Space Jam is another rare live action-animated movie. And if you like Space Jam, I also reccomend the Pagemaster. The movie stars Michael Jordan as himself. And I guess that this is a part of this movie is based on a true story. But most of this didn't. In real life Michael did retire and play baseball, but I don't believe that he got pulled down a golf course and aliens making thier way into basketball players like Charles Barkley and stealing thier talent, or a failing park like Moron Mountain. And I don't know if in real life Michael Jordan's father allowed him to play basketball after midnight in the summer of 1973. Which that is how Space Jam opens, then jumps to opening credits with the title song, and then we see Michael Jordan (as himself) at a press conference where he annoces that he is retring from the NBA (Notinal Basket Asscontaion) and going to baseball where we and learn that he went 0-4. And then aliens show up from outer space to kidnap Bugs Bunny and other looney toon characters. But the looney toons ask for a chance to defend themselves and changle them to a basketball game.

7151876,4,B00WRNGTRG,"Air Jordan and the Heckling Hare? Couldn't work.....could it? Leave your cynicism about merchaindaising at the door, because Space Jam accomplishes something that The Flintstones Meets The Jetsons, or other such fare, could never achieve. First, for such a goofy concept, the film is remarkably grounded in reality, and some of the best scenes are about victimized NBA players dealing with no talents; add to that the implications of Jordan's experience with the Looneys affecting his chosen sport. Performances are dead-on, and Michael is as properly laconic an actor as he is a player. Finally, the key to this is the Looney Tunes themselves - it's their first foray into true feature films. Thankfully, each character (especially Bugs and Daffy, and those two ought to be) are complete in character as they were in the 40s and 50s. Seeing Bugs get equal billing as the live-action star is beyond promising; it's a reminder that Bugs Bunny has possibly meant more to Americans than a great deal of actors, writers, and directors combined. People will pass on, but the ""mild-mannered forest creature"", as he himself would put it, will live on into eternity.",1000339200,7,1158,5.036458333333333

If you are below the age of 10, like sports, and have never seen a REAL Bugs Bunny cartoon, you might like it.  Other than that, its only saving grace is the Pulp Fiction reference with Elmer and Sam near the end- oh, and Bill Murray.  Michael Jordan's appearance is solely for the sake of showing him play ball with Jock Jams playing in the background whilst the cartoon characters stand in awe.  I'd rather watch Cartoon Network.",996105600,4,602,4.274336283185841

The special effects aren't up to par with, say, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", but they come pretty close. Not all the jokes work, and the first half-hour is a bit slow. But once Jordan and the toons team up, the film really hits its stride.
I was surprised, because with a huge sports star like Jordan in this kind of film, I thought the emphasis would've been more on marketing and sponsorship strategies than working hard to make a decent film. Thankfully, I was wrong.",982368000,2,712,4.6141732283464565

It goes over his childhood and how at such a young age he showed amazing talent at the game of basketball. The film goes through his retirement from the Chicago Bulls and his decision to venture into other sports. You see moments from his short lived minor league baseball career, his golfing endeavors, as well and his triumphant return to the NBA. The scenes where Michael is training to regain his skill on the court spotlights that even after he had been away for so long, he is still the best to ever play the game. I highly recommend you view this film.",1530316800,,654,4.695652173913044
