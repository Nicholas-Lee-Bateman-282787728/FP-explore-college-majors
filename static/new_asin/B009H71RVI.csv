8619825,3,B009H71RVI,Good video for form as well as developing your own workout routines. Mike uses a lot of dual kettlebell excercises to ramp things up. This workout is not a follow along workout as Mike does not do that here. He shows you the excercises then its up to you to develop the discipline to put them into action.,1362614400,4,305,4.275862068965517
