546949,5,6303011594,"This version of Frances Hodgeson Burnett's classic novel, staring Alec Guiness and Ricky Schroder, is excellent!  Excellent acting by all the cast!!  The story line:  Young Cedric Erroll is summoned to England from New York by the Grandfather he has never met.  His crusty grandfather begins training him to be the next Earl of Dorincourt.  Needless to say, the grandfather himself becomes transformed by Cedie!  I especially appreciate that the movie producers used the novel for the story line without the typical ""Hollywood twist"".  The last half an hour of the movie happens during the Christmas season, and it is a touching climax to a wonderful presentation of the story.",1006560000,34,677,5.1
546950,5,6303011594,"Don't let all those who prefer the 1980 filming of this story influence you before looking at this classic. Yes, it is black and white and the style of talking is perhaps odd to us in the 21st century. But it is of historical value and I believe that as the cast and crew lived in a time period closer to that of the story's timeline and that their way of speaking had more of the older and ""englisher"" english than that slang we americans drawl from our nasal passages now-a-days,there is a certain genuine charm that spews forth from the actors. Get them both if the 1980 version becomes available, but see this one for what it is, a true film classic! R.A.M.",1006214400,15,661,4.338709677419355

547188,1,6303011594,"This PAL Region 2 DVD is listed as having the original English language soundtrack, but be warned  that some people are complaining that it is in Italian (maybe they haven't changed the audio options?) and others were not aware that European DVDs will not play in standard US DVD players.

It's a shame this film isn't available as a North American DVD release, and INTACT. This Italian DVD shows a running time of only 99 minutes which is what some US VHS copies ran for. This is an EDITED version from American TV broadcasts.  The full length film, which also came out on VHS on the StarMaker label, runs c. 120 minutes.  This is harder to find and has never been released on DVD to my knowledge, sadly.

This is a well-scripted and well-acted adaptation of the Christmas classic, quality production all the way.  Alec Guinness and Connie Booth shine.",1478217600,3,853,4.653333333333333

547193,5,6303011594,"This really needs to be available in a USA format, on DVD.
I became interested in this for several reasons, one of which is that it was filmed at Harlaxton Manor, in England. I stayed in that great Manor  House overnight in 2007 and a family member spent a semester there as a student. It was a grand and thrilling experience.  Harlaxton Manor has a great website, also reviewed on Wikipedia, and is owned by the University of Evansville, IN.
This film version has gotten great reviews and the story has obviously endured as a favorite down the generations.
Why is it not available on DVD for an American audience? Now that VHS players are no longer being made, is this film version to be relegated to obscurity ?",1473033600,,713,4.51937984496124

547461,5,6303011594,"This is one of the best versions, though none of them is bad!  This is one of the most inspiring and enduring of tales, and I think it would be difficult to actually ruin the story.  I wasn't familiar with this version and I'm so glad I got it.  Excellent acting.  Freddie is as endearing as Ricky Schroder in the later version.  If they can put Freddie Bartholomew's 1936 B&W version unto DVD, surely they can also put Ricky Schroder and Alex Guiness' version on DVD too!  Ricky Schroder and Alex Guiness are still my favorites, though still only available in VHS, which is crazy, although I can watch the Freddie Bartholomew one even in B&W and find it enchanting every time.  The BBC version is also good, but very irritating to have it forever stopping in the middle of action like a TV program which it obviously was.  The differences are just as much fun as the original story.  So having all 3 versions is not boring at all.",1436486400,,931,4.429411764705883

547706,5,6303011594,"Little Lord Fauntleroy was originally a wildly successful children's novel written in the 1880s by Frances Hodgson Burnett.  It's the story of a fatherless New York lad, Ceddie,  who lives with his widowed mother after the death of his English father, who came from an aristocratic family.  Unexpected deaths in that family result in Ceddie being designated the heir apparent to an Earldom, and he and his mother go to England so he can begin preparations to assume his inheritance.  Plot complications arise from the prejudice of the old Earl, Ceddie's grandfather, against Ceddie's American mother, and the appearance of a pretender who seems to have a better claim to the Earldom.  Both complications are resolved, the latter albeit by an egregiously unlikely coincidence, and a happy ending is granted to all concerned.

The book's success led to over a century of film, television, and theatre versions, of which the 1936 film directed by John Cromwell is undoubtedly the best known.  This is a classic Hollywood Golden Age sentimental favorite, with a cast of old movie stalwarts you will have seen often before, including Freddie Bartholomew, Mickey Rooney, Dolores Costello, Guy Kibbee (in perhaps his best role,) C. Aubrey Smith, Una O'Connor, and others -- some of the names may be unfamiliar to you, but if you watch many classic Hollywood films, you'll recognize all the faces.

Until recently, this film has been available only in very inferior versions on TV, VHS, and DVD, but in 2012  Kino/Lorber issued a Blu-Ray DVD (I think there may also be a standard one issued) which is advertised as an ""Authorized edition from the estate of David O. Selznick from the collection of George Eastman House,"" ""mastered in HD from a original nitrate 35 mm print."" At 101 minutes, I assume it's uncut.  That print isn't pristine: though resolution and contrast are fine, there are some streaks and many specks, and the sound track is definitely tinny, not enough so to obscure the dialogue, but the fine Max Steiner score does sound a bit distorted.  All in all, this is probably the vehicle of choice now to watch this film on.

If you've seen this film before only on a probably poor quality and incomplete TV version and liked it, you'll enjoy seeing it properly on the Kino DVD.  And if you haven't seen it, I'm sure you'll find it worth watching if you like classic Hollywood films, or if you're just in the mood for an old fashioned, outrageously sentimental movie which will leave you grinning through your tears.",1421366400,2,2522,4.878220140515222

(After 22.09, the picture is acceptable considering the movie was filmed in 1936 in black and white.)  From 10:10 to 22:09, I could not make out faces, trees and any other components of the scenery.  If a face appeared for a few seconds, the sound - the words spoken did not match the lip movements and the speech was broken.  Some scenes resembled old science fiction movies of monsters of undefined shapes.  I knew what to expect b/c I have the VHS version and wanted to buy a dvd version for a friend.  In order that I not be ashamed of the gift, I played the dvd.  Reviewers did rate the dvd and some encountered problems described as a 'poor transfer' and others encountered no problems.  I did not understand the reasons for the large variance in the evaluations.  I do not know if this is the case, but on one occasion when I was looking for reviews of a drum unit manufactured and sold as the 'equivalent' of the one sold by the manufacturer of my printer, I noticed that the reviews did not refer to the same product I was interested in buying.

547823,5,6303011594,"This has to be the closest movie version to the book...and also the sweetest.  Ricky Schroder makes an adorably boyish Cedric Errol without being prissy, girly, or syrupy sweet.  He is just himself!  And of course Alec Guinness plays a perfectly gruff and aristocratic earl.  Our only quarrel would be with Cedric's mother, who is portrayed as an out-and-out feminist trying to impress people with her stubbornly 'strong mind', instead of the guilessly sweet mother of the book who wins the earl with her kind and gentle ways that remind the earl so strikingly of the little boy he has learned to love.  This is overshadowed for the most part, though, with the faithful depiction of the loyal Dick(the boot-black) and the blustery Mr. Hobbs(the grocer)!
The story ends at Christmas, instead of Cedric's birthday like the book; but it makes a very upbeat and heartwarming conclusion.

547825,5,6303011594,"Der Kleine Lord/Little Lord Fauntleroy is a Top Quality restoration of one of our favorite films. We have loved this wonderful story starring Ricky Schroder & Alec Guinness, since we first got a copy about 10 years ago. That copy was actually on a CD and had good color. We wanted to give copies of the movie to family members as gifts, but could not find another copy with good color, after searching for years.
This DVD comes with a choice of Three languages, German (also on the box), English & Italian. It is a region 2 format disc, but frankly, this movie is so great that we think it is easily worth the price of an all region DVD player, to get a copy this good.

Amazon has very kindly given us links to several companies that do offer region 1 discs. Mine has excellent sound and picture quality, and the movie is an unexpected treasure, a brilliantly directed 100-minute jewel with no dull spots and splendid acting.
Sir Alex Guinness reaches new heights in his portrayal of the Earl, and Ricky Schroder, age ten, is already a budding comedian. Many of the minor parts are played by noted British Shakespearean actors and actresses. Look for Patrick Stewart (AKA ""Karla"") in a cameo as the riding teacher. Look also for a wonderful shouting match between the Earl and Lord Fauntleroy's  mother, conducted through the coachman, since the Earl and his daughter-in-law are not speaking to each other. Turn your eyes away, if you need to, from a few short, tragic scenes of poverty and despair among the Earl's tenants.

548199,3,6303011594,"To start, I much prefer the Anchor Bay edition.  It was hoped that Kino would release a definitive version, but it was far from it.  It gets a 3-star rating because I am very conflicted(the film itself deserves a 5, but Kino deserves a 0).  It is bare-bones and has serious flaws.  About 37 minutes in, there is a dialogue splice where 2 words are missing.  The original Selznick opening before the title card is gone(the original opening card says ""A Selznick International Picture"" with the same background as the title card)and is replaced by the one with the bells and studio, and then cuts in with the title card.  This is unforgiveable when the original opening can be seen on some other prints.  Kino has been releasing some older features like this, but since this is the way they are going to treat them, I will not throw any more money away on crap like this.  The Anchor Bay edition is not perfect, but is much preferable to this.  There are NO dialogue splices.  There might be a few more minor instances of print damage.  The audio/video quality overall is comparable(very good).  The AB edition's only issue is that it also has the missing original opening card.  Although not as bad as Kino because it is just a card of the Selznick sign with the original soundtrack music underneath(which helps immensely).  The AB edition even includes an excellent original theatrical trailer(very impressive looking).",1380844800,2,1419,4.762295081967213
548200,5,6303011594,"This classic British film is rereleased in the (optionally) dubbed and subtitled Italian version in a Region 2 release. It joins three other versions in my collection, including those with the Little Lord played by Mary Pickford and Mickey Rooney. It is by far the best.

This version of Little Lord Fauntleroy stars a young newcomer Ricky Schroeder paired with a seasoned Alec Guinness (then in the midst of his 'Obi-wan' Kenobi role in Star Wars). Guinness is the aging, ill, and tight-fisted British Lord who decides to send to America for his grandson. He hopes to separate him from everything American, including his loving mother, and make him into his heir. But the little lord cannot suppress his youthful optimism and joy for life. It is he who converts his grandfather, and all seems well until a new claimant to the Lordship comes forth. Along the way the story points out in vivid fashion the contrast between wealth of the Lord an his manor and the squalor of his tenants. A great and timeless story, well told in this version. (For a slightly different twist on the story, look into the equally enjoyable, though less accurate, Die Kleine Lady, a 2012 Austria-German Release, where its the lady of the castle and her 12 year old granddaughter.)

548372,5,6303011594,"This story has been filmed several times through the centuries. Each brings with it the strengths and weaknesses of the time period in which it was made. A few examples are:
1914 - Gerald Royston - Cedric Erroll
1921 - Mary Pickford - Little Lord Fauntleroy/Dearest
1936 - Freddy Bartholomew - Cedric `Ceddie' Erroll
1976 - Glen Anderson - Lord Fauntleroy
1980 - Rick Schroder - Lord Fauntleroy (Ceddie Errol)
1995 - Michael Benz - Cedric Errol
2003 - Aleksei Vesyolkin - Cedric

As with any story, everyone has their favorite interpretation. This is a review of the 1936 version.

Ceddie (Freddy Bartholomew) is a well meaning kid, which is wise beyond his years and very well mannered. He lives alone with his mother Dearest (Dolores Costello Barrymore.) He is the product of his environment (America depression era) where he is mentored by a wise grocer (Guy Kibbee,) and befriended by others such as the shoe shine boy (Mickey Rooney.)

Turns out that he is the long lost grandson of the Earl of DorinCourt (C. Aubrey Smith,) and heir to an estate in England. So he is ""Little Lord Fauntleroy."" He is removed from the only home he knows and whisked off to England. There he does not realize that his grandfather can not stand his mother (they never met) so she has to stay in another house.

All is going swimmingly until the ""Real Little Lord Fauntleroy"" the son of the other brother shows up. Now what will happen? Is `Ceddie' destined to be second fiddle? Will his mother go back to America? What do his old friends think when they find out? Looks like curtains for everyone.",1367712000,,1582,4.659498207885305

548549,1,6303011594,"Last week I gave away an Electrolux  vacuum cleaner.  It was purchased by my mother in New Jersey in 1968.  It cleaned our homes in New Jersey and Florida for 15 years, and it is still functioning perfectly.  I only gave it away because today's lightweight vacs are much easier to tote.  I tell this story because there was a time in this country when companies took pride in their products and ripping consumers off was unheard of, or at the very least, it seldom occurred.  But the years have passed and companies don't care about quality anymore.  Now it's all about getting top dollar for inferior products that promise you everything and deliver nothing.  Such is the case with Kino's The Selznick Collection.  All five films in this boxed set claim the following:  MASTERED IN HD FROM AN ORIGINAL NITRATE 35MM PRINT PRESERVED BY THE GEORGE EASTMAN HOUSE MOTION PICTURE DEPARTMENT.  If this is actually true I am willing to eat all five DVDs and then the cardboard box itself.  All five films are of substandard quality, some of them so awful that they are barely viewable.  The most disastrous of them all is BIRD OF PARADISE, with the lovely Dolores del Rio, which is not only marred by visuals worthy of bad public domain piracy but is also afflicted with a distortion of its soundtrack from the very beginning of the film, making the dialog unintelligible, to say nothing about Max Steiner's fabulous score, which is distorted beyond recognition.  I have seen public domain copies of this film which are superior to this absolute merde Kino claims came from an original nitrate negative.  Sound and image problems plague all five releases.  The two Technicolor classics, A STAR IS BORN and NOTHING SACRED suffer from color variations which go from a pinkish hue to something that looks like three-strip Technicolor.  At no time during these two films does one get any semblance to real Technicolor or anything close to it.  The best of the worst are LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY and A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which is not saying much because the visuals are still substandard and so is the sound. It's just that compared to the other three aberrations, these two fare a little better.  But I would like to stress that the entire set is no better than a bad public domain copy of any of these films.  Kino has added no extras whatsoever, not even English subtitles.  It's a no frills package of unacceptable prints at premium prices.  This is an insult and a slap in the face to consumers and collectors.  There should be an agency that handles situations such as this, and Kino should be made liable, and be forced to reimburse EVERYONE who has fallen prey to their false claims and advertising and has purchased these five films, whether singly, or all together in a boxed set.  So be warned, if you spend any money on any of these 5 releases, you are just throwing your money away.  If you absolutely must have one or more of these films, I suggest borrowing them from your public library or renting them and making dubs.  It's exactly what Kino deserves for putting out crap like this.",1357516800,7,3085,4.666666666666667

548691,4,6303011594,"In the late 1800s, there was one book that was so popular, it led to the popularity of velvet.  The book was ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"", written by English playwright and author Frances Hodgson Burnett and was originally published in St. Nicholas Magazine between Nov. 1885 through Oct. 1886 and later followed as a book.

The book was quite elaborate when it came to the details of the young Fauntleroy's clothing that its impact on American fashion, primarily with children as parents would dress their kids in suits and away from skirted garments which were favored at the time.

Considered as the ultimate ""rags to riches"" story at the time, the book would receive several film adaptations from 1914-1995.  The best known versions were the 1921 film starring Mary Pickford, a 1980 version starring Alec Guiness, Rick Schroder and Eric Porter but the best known adaptation is the 1936 film starring Freddie Bartholomew and Dolores Costello.

The film was directed by John Cromwell (""Of Human Bondage"", ""Since You Went Away"", ""Made For Each Other"", ""The Prisoner of Zenda"") and a screenplay by Hugh Walpole (""David Copperfield"", ""Vanessa: Her Love Story"", ""Kind Lady"") and the film would make Freddie Bartholomew as one of the most highly sought after child actors and also the second paid child actor after Shirley Temple.  Which unfortunately, also became a double-edged sword for Bartholomew as the success of the film would lead to his long-estranged birth parents trying to gain custody and control of his fortune, a seven-year-battle which took a toll on Barthlomew and his career.

But despite the legal troubles and hardships that Bartholomew would experience after 1936, he will forever be remembered for his performance in the film ""Lord Little Fauntleroy"".  And now, the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in 2012 courtesy of Kino Lorber.

VIDEO:

""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and was mastered in HD from an original nitrate 35 mm print, preserved by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department.  With that being said, first thing I need to remind those who are not familiar to Kino Blu-rays is that unlike other companies that spend a lot of money on restoration (which is very expensive), Kino does not do the restoration, they release the original transfer on Blu-ray in the best quality possible.

And when it comes to films that were originally on nitrate, I'm usually expecting worse for wear.  Primarily because most films filmed on nitrate are now lost (because they were highly flammable and would spontaneously catch on fire) or was severely damaged.  Fortunately there are films that were taken care of, transferred to a better medium but during that time, the priority was saving the film not removing defects, specks, etc.  They were direct transfers that were not cleaned up.

With the release of ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"", one can expect to see scenes with white specks, scenes that have some aging.  That is a given!  But the positive news is that for a film that was derived from an original 35 mm nitrate print, despite the specks and aging, this film looks very good on Blu-ray.  It looks like the original negative was not tampered as much, thus less damage.  I didn't notice any acid or nitrate burns or excessive flickering or darkening.  If anything, this film looks very good for its age and considering where it was taken from.

While the video quality may not be as good as some of Kino's Buster Keaton titles on Blu-ray, for those who have followed the David O. Selznick collection releases, should be happy with the overall release.  Especially since this is the best version of the film out on video to date.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

While ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" does look good for a film nearly 80-years-old, sound-wise, it's a different story.  The film is presented in 2.0 monaural and while the dialogue can be heard quite well, there is also quite a few moments of pops and clicks and during the musical moments of the film, especially for the intro or ending of the film, the sound seems a bit too loud and loses its clarity.  But those scenes are short and the good news is that the film does sound good and dialogue is clear for the majority of the film.

There are no subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" comes with no special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" is a heartwarming classic that showcases American pride but also love for family.  In many ways, this is the kind of film that would be commonplace in America for the next two decades despite the focus on the middle-class family, we have a proper middleclass family with a boy with the heart of gold.

John Cromwell's 1936 version of ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" is probably the best film adaptation for the mere fact that Freddie Bartholomew plays the character of Ceddie Errol with complete efficacy.  He embodies the style and mannerisms of what one would think of Little Lord Fauntleroy that even Frances Hodgson Burnett would have been happy with his performance.

One has to bare in mind that 1930s, many child stars depicted on the big screen were kids who managed to get in a bit of trouble but yet they were fun to watch and full of spunk.  May it be Hal Roach's Little Rascals (Our Gang) to The East End Kids, even Little Rascals star Sid Kibrick makes an appearance in this film, as did a younger Mickey Rooney.

But one can see why the storyline was so popular when the novel was released in the late 1800s.  This was a rags-to-riches story but also an inspiring story of love between a young boy and his mother, but yet treated everyone with kindness and respect.  Many parents can hope their kids could be as happy, kind like Ceddie and even in Cromwell's film, Ceddie is the boy that many parents would love to have (or hope their kids could as well-mannered).

And then you have the pro-American, not-yet apple pie mentality with Ceddie telling his English grandfather that he is American, because he was born in America, despite his grandfather insisting that he is English.  And of course to show that even this little angel has his tough side as the local kids gang up on him and call him a ""sissy"" because of his clothes and he speaks proper English, and we see how this young boy is not afraid to defend himself and fight.

But as you have a film with so much humor, what literally wins you over is the film's heart.  It's relationships from Ceddie and his mother, as any one can understand the pain it is for a young boy to be separated from his mother but yet, he is able to keep a brave face for his grandfather.  And of course, to see his grandfather change with being around Ceddie and we see the transformation of this ""grinch"" who eventually becomes more and more compassionate.

With solid costume design and impressive performances by its cast, John Cromwell and Hugh Walpole were able to give incredible life to Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved novel.  But once again, it's Freddie Bartholomew who makes this film work.  As Jackie Cooper was able to bring this heartwarming emotion to his character Dink in the 1931 film ""The Champ"", Freddie Bartholomew was able to knock the ball out of the ballpark with this performance that featured grace but fine attention to subtlety.  He embodies the character of Little Lord Fauntleroy and once you see him perform, you can understand why he was one of Hollywood's most popular and famous child actors at that time.

And while Mickey Rooney was child actor who had appeared in many films by 1936 and was already well-known, for silent film fans, ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" would also feature silent film actress Dolores Costello (who was married to silent actor John Barrymore) in one of her few talking films and the film would also star C. Aubrey Smith, who was an actor in Hollywood during the '30s and '40s, also best known for creating the Hollywood Cricket Club and also for his height at 6'4.

As for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned earlier, you're not going to find anything pristine for this film and for how good it looks considering it was mastered in HD from an original nitrate 35 mm print and is nearly 80-years-old. While I wish there were special features such as audio commentary or even an interview with Mickey Rooney, then again, not many film from the 1930s on Blu-ray or DVD come with any.

Overall, ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" is a charming, heartwarming film that showcases an amazing performance from its cast, especially from the young Freddie Bartholomew.  If you enjoy positive, upbeat, classic Hollywood films from the 1930s, ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" is recommended!",1352419200,8,8652,4.799055967633176
548692,5,6303011594,"This is one of my most favorite movies. It is great for my family to watch, especially when you see Cedric (Ricky Schroeder) with such a great heart.  He is an amazing young man who even when receiving riches from an unknown British earl; he remains the polite, caring, respectful young man who is always looking for the good in others.  Even though his grumpy British grandfather doesn't like his American mother, Cedric remains loyal to her and loves her deeply.  He softens the heart of his grandfather through time and a positive attitude.  There is a bit of suspense about a possible heir who could claim Cedric's right to be the next earl. However his common, American friends work that problem out nicely. Ricky Schroeder is amazing, as Cedric, the Little Lord Fauntleroy.

I truly found this film so uplifting and moving and a call to arms to pay it forward and very glad that I pushed through the parental vision and made my own opinion of love, joy, appreciation, humility, etc., high recommend for anyone who desires depiction of a true hero and emulation of a qualified love guru... praise GOD for such a gem...",1345507200,,844,4.827586206896552

548817,4,6303011594,"""Little Lord Fauntleroy""  is the 1936 adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel.  After the death of her husband, the patient Mrs. Errol (Dolores Costello) raises Ceddie (Freddie Bartholomew) in New York with much goodwill, but little money. Unexpectedly, Ceddie is summoned to England to become heir to the fortune of the Earl of Dorincourt (C. Aubrey Smith), his estranged grandfather, and take the title of Lord Fauntleroy. But there are problems: the Earl refuses to allow Mrs. Errol into his home, and then another boy claims to be the true inheritor.

Producer David O Selznick (""Gone With the Wind"") has taken great care with the look and casting of the picture. Bartholomew manages to shoulder the film, with the benefit of strong supporting performances by Smith, Costello, Henry Stephenson, character actor Guy Kibbee, and Mickey Rooney as one of Ceddie's Brooklyn pals. There are no bonus extras on the Blu-ray ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" release.",1341964800,,959,5.214285714285714

(Little Freddie also was capable of being the perfect spoiled brat in ""Captains Courageous."")

Mickey Rooney (who appears in this movie) once remarked that it is not difficult to play the part of a brat, but to play a good child and make it interesting -- that's a major challenge! This Bartholomew accomplishes with grace and flair and a beautiful, royal British accent. (He out-royals the British Royal Family in his elegant and clear manner of speech.)

The late Roddy McDowall, of ""Lassie Come Home"" and ""My Friend Flicka,"" was greatly interested in the restoration of films in danger of being lost forever. ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" is truly a classic that deserves, like the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies, to be fully restored and preserved.",1306713600,2,960,4.956521739130435

LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY is an obscure little film (obscure by today's standards, at least) based on Frances Hodgeson Burnett's classic victorian children's novel of the same name.  But this film would also be considered something near a miracle by today's standards as well.  For it was made during an age in which a movie could be top notch entertainment without loads of profanity, sexuality, and gratuitous violence.

LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY is that and more.  It's a tale of innocence, sweetness, and redemption.  It boasts tremendous performances by Freddie Bartholmew (probably the most popular male child star of his day, with talent to match), a very young Mickey Rooney (who would later star with Bartholomew in the classics THE DEVIL IS A SISSY and CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS), Delores Costello, and classic British veteran actor C. Aubrey Smith.

This is a movie I can watch over and over.  I admit that it's corny, cheesy, and sometimes a little overly dramatic.  But compared with all the negativity and ruthlessness Hollywood puts out today, it's a breath of fresh air.",1296172800,3,1119,5.104395604395604

549016,5,6303011594,"Get out your handkerchiefs for this 1936 film classic of the 1886 book of the same name. It stars child star Freddie Bartholomew as Little Lord Flauntleroy and Dolores Costello Barrymore as his mother with an excellent supporting cast including C. Aubrey Smith (the Earl), Henry Stephenson (the Earl's lawyer), Una O'Connor (the maid), Guy Kibbee (Mr. Hobbs), and Mickey Rooney (Dick, the boot black).

Apart from Shirley Temple, Freddie Bartholomew (1924-92) was the biggest child star of the 30s. He starred in ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""Anna Karenina"" (1935), ""Captains Courageous"" (1937), and ""Kidnapped"" (1938). Like most child stars, he lost his appeal when he grew up and his film roles declined. Here is 1936 we see him at the peak of his charm.

Dolores Costello (1903-79) got her film break in ""The Sea Beast"" (1926) where she also met future husband John Barrymore (their son, John Drew, is the father of actress Drew Barrymore). Initially she retired from films to care for the family, but she divorced Barrymore in 1935 (due to his alcoholism) and returned to films, this one being her first. She's probably best remembered for her role as Isabel in Orson Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons"". Costello's performance in Little Lord Flauntleroy is excellent, and very different from her performance as Isabel years later.

The great C Aubrey Smith (1863-1948) appeared in more than 100 films from 1915 to 1949. He gave us memorable roles in a host of films, including Major Hamilton in ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), Lord Capulet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936), and Colonel Zapt in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1937). I remember him best as Col. Williams in ""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) with Shirley Temple and as Jane's father in ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" (1932). Smith is terrific as the stern Grandfather who is melted by the charm of the young Lord.

Henry Stephenson (1871-1956) was everyone's favorite uncle. He started in the silent era and often played opposite Errol Flynn as a Governor, Lord, or Duke in films such as ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""Prince and the Pauper"" (1937), and ""Essex and Elizabeth"" (1939). He appeared in several Tarzan movies as an archeologist or explorer. I remember him best  as Sir Charles Macefield in ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936).

Una O'Connor (1880-1959) was a terrific actress who made nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1957. She was a true scene stealer and did so in films such as ""The Invisible Man"" (1933), ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), and ""The Adventure of Robin Hood"" (1938). She is relatively low key in this film.

Guy Kibbee (1882-1956) had a round face and a jolly demeanor that helped him through more than 100 films between 1931 and 1948. He appeared in films like ""Babbitt"" (1934), ""Captain Blood"" (1935), and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939).

Unlike Freddie Barthelmew, Mickey Rooney's (1920) career lasted, and he made nearly 300 films from 1926 to 2010. He was a major star of the silent era with his ""Mickey's"" shorts and then went on to save MGM with his ""Andy Hardy"" series and his films with Judy Garland. He won a Juvenile Oscar in 1939 and went on to garner 4 nominations. He was nominated 3 times for an Emmy and won once (""Bill"" in 1981).

The 30s were the best of times for films derived from English classics, including ""Oliver Twist"" (1933) with Dickie Moore, ""Great Expectations"" (1934) with Henry Hull and Jane Wyatt, ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" (1935) with Claude Rains, ""Scrooge"" (1935), ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1935) with Ronald Coleman, and ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) with Reginald Owen, etc.  No other decade would support so many adaptations.

Director John Cromwell (1887-1979) made nearly 50 films from 1929 to 1961, but he was particularly busy in the 30s when he made ""Tom Sawyer"" (1930), ""Of Human Bondage"" (1934), ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1937), and ""The Adventures of Marco Polo"" (1938). When  not directing he was a busy actor, especially on Broadway where he won a Tony in 1952 for ""Point of No Return"".

David Selznick (1902-1965) produced under the Selznick International label. Selznick is best remembered for ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939), but he was nominated for 8 other Oscars for films as diverse as ""Viva Villa"" (1934),  ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1936), ""A Star is Born"" (1937), ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Spellbound"" (1945). Beyond these, he was also involved in one capacity or another in such classics as ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1957) and ""The Third Man"" (1949) among the nearly 90 films he produced.

According to Mickey Rooney, the film was made at a cost of $500,000 and returned more than $2 million.

This is a beautifully made and acted film. It's a true classic. Perhaps a bit sentimental for the current age, but it needs to be viewed within the context of the original book (1886) and the film (1936).",1292112000,6,4823,4.856272838002436
549017,5,6303011594,"Little Lord Fauntleroy is the Victorian equivalent of Harry Potter in terms of sales! I've just taken a children's literature course and it's amazing that such a simple, but moving story could cause such sales. Yet such is the magic of Frances Burnett the author of the book Little Lord Fauntleroy. The magic in her books comes entirely from one's own good character.  Ceddie, played realistically enough by Ricky, is the heir to an earl who lives in England. The earl, played  perfectly, by Sir Alec Guiness (Star Wars), does not want an American heir, but since Ceddie is the last heir to the title he sends for Ceddie to come. However, Ceddie's mother (played beautifully by Connie Booth from Fawlty Towers) is not welcome. Will the old earl ever allow Ceddie's mother inside the gates of the castle? How will this American born boy react to his new English grandfather and Ceddie's new English title of Lord Fauntleroy?

This production is so very well done because the actors are so very good at playing their parts well. Nothing is ever too sweet or too sentimental, which helps to make Ceddie's journey more engaging.

I highly recommend this production and have really taken the time to review this to try to prod someone into releasing a restored version onto DVD. However, I have bought the VHS tape multiple times and I will do so again if I have to. This movie also hits well upon themes of social and economic disparity during the Victorian era. That might make it a good talking point for why unions were formed and what effects the Industrial Revolution had upon society in both the U.K. and the U.S. The movie though is primarily concerned with the concept of a nobility of character and Frances makes her case well!",1291939200,,1732,4.6875

The Little Lord Fauntleroy story of adventure, discovery and love is well known -- but the variation in length and quality of its DVD incarnations is NOT so well known.  I believe the bad reviews of the DVD were for other versions.  I bought several, because in 2009 Amazon listed this version with a running time of 98 minutes, and I knew the film length was 102.  What a  surprise I had, after buying other versions, to find THIS version contains the full length -- 102 minutes!  The picture transfer was very clear, and the sound mostly good.

I have found that frequently, among oldie films or controversial films, there is great variation in length of releases on DVD.  The description on the case of THIS version says it is 100 minutes long, when in fact it is 102.  Usually, the reverse holds.  Sellers have no way of knowing the actual length of what they sell, when the case itself is incorrect.

Since I now have gone strictly to the DVD format, I have been searching for all of my favorite videos on DVD.

As part of the acting legacy of the late Sir Alec Guiness, this movie should be a must DVD for all of his fans! Also, as an added bonus for Star Trek fans, Patrick Stewart makes a very nice cameo appearance in this movie before he became Captain Picard. Finally, I believe one of the writers-producers, Blanche Hanalis, of the 1970's Little House On The Prairie TV series was also behind the making of this movie, which was originally presented by Hallmark as part of its Gold Crown Entertainment series.

When the DVD came, I was most pleased with the transfer.  The picture is very clean and crisp and the audio portion is so superior that I am able to hear dialogue clearly which I had missed previously.  Missing scenes?  No. In fact, there are some small scenes in the DVD version which I had not seen before in the other versions I have viewed (for example, the dining room table scene with Ceddie and the Earl of Dorincourt).

All this aside, I love this movie for its portrayal of the redeeming power of love.  My children benefit from watching it because Lord Fauntleroy is a powerful example of courage, respect and virtue.  I have often wondered what it would be like to have a child without sin (only Jesus qualifies), but ""Ceddie"" as Little Lord Fauntleroy is perhaps the closest approximation to come from earthly minds.  His mother, also, is a woman of admirable strength, wisdom and grace.  Most inspiring.

I have no reservations recommending this film in DVD format.",1141084800,50,1324,4.7631578947368425

549415,5,6303011594,"Based on the popular childrens' novel of the same name, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, this is a very engrossing story that in a way transcends being a childrens' story.  It takes place in 1885, starting in New York City and moving across the pond to England after young Cedric Errol (Little Lord Fauntleroy) is told that he is now a lord and next in line to become Earl of Dorincourt.  Cedric and his mother Dearest aren't exactly well-off, but Cedric doesn't want to leave at first, even knowing it will greatly improve their social and financial status, because of how attached he is to the city, how much he wants to become President when he grows up, so he can help the less fortunate, the horrible things he's been told earls do, and how devoted he is to his three closest friends, Hobbs, a storekeeper, Mrs. McGinty, who sells apples, and Dick, who blackens boots.

After moving to England, Cedric, now Lord Fauntleroy, is rather upset at how his mother is forced to live in a cabin outside of the main estate instead of there in the castle with him and his grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt.  ""Grandfather Earl,"" as he calls him, never approved of the relationship Dearest and Cedric's father had, and originally didn't think very highly of Cedric himself either, but quickly lets down his reserve and finds himself incredibly charmed by his grandson.  Cedric doesn't want to be the type of earl he's heard about back home, however, and uses his power and new position to help the less fortunate, like he would have done if he had become President when he was older.  Things seem to be going swimmingly when all of a sudden it appears as though there might be another heir, with a more legitimate claim, which threatens to upturn the happy secure new life Cedric has made for himself.  His friends back home, however, are positive this cannot be, and do some research to try to right things before it might be too late.

This is really a charming story, and also serves as wholesome family entertainment, despite the old-fashioned story (it does take place in the nineteenth century, and really reflects that different society and era), though it does seem a bit chatty at times for a silent film.  That is to be expected, though, seeing as it was based on a book and not just created solely or primarily for the screen.  The musical score is also very lovely, and the special effects are really something.  Dual roles had been played before, but not the same way you see here, such as when Cedric kisses his mother.  This was before they had computers; they had to create all of these special effects, seemingly primitive today, without help from high-tech machines.  Although I have to agree that you can't really forget that Cedric is being played by a woman, as much as she really gets into the role and acts like a little boy.  It was one thing for Mary Pickford to play little girls and teenagers, but in this role you never really forget that she's actually a woman and not a little boy, as good as she is at it.  She just looks too pretty, too womanly, for people to completely suspend disbelief and after awhile just lose track of the fact that she is in fact a woman.",1129766400,2,3184,4.56140350877193
549416,5,6303011594,"The Alec Guinness/Ricky Schroder version was so beautifully filmed, that the scenery and costuming become a member of this stellar case.  I watched this (made for TV) movie when it first aired, and have been amazed that such an elaborate production has not become a yearly tradition.  To my knowledge it has never aired but the one time--what a waste and what a pity.  I search the TV listings each year.

I am forced to watch our extended-play, grainy VHS copy--the beauty of this story has become a family favorite.  Christmas would not be Christmas without seeing it.

The story is perdictable--from the start you know all will turn out well.  In the best Dickens-ist tradition.  Bad is turned into good, eventually.  You willing gallup along anyway because the cast captures the roles so comvincingly and the beauty is equally captivating.

What will it take to have this movie released on a remastered DVD?  This holiday season do yourself a favor and ferret out a copy--Then kick back and let the Christmad spirit wash over you.

I don't promise any surprises, but you might find yourself drawn into the faithful circle that believe this film is among the very best of Christmas stories filmed.",1116115200,30,1200,4.828431372549019
549417,4,6303011594,"Little Lord Fauntleroy is an enjoyable Mary Pickford film. It is unusual not so much because she plays two roles, she had done that already in Stella Maris, but because she plays a boy. The story, adapted from Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic of a young American boy going to England to claim his inheritance, is well told with lots of humour and sentiment. Pickford does well in her two roles of mother and son and the way she interacts with herself on screen is a delight to watch, especially when one knows that these special effects were all done in the camera. Her acting in the part of Cedric can hardly be faulted. She throws herself, sometimes literally, into the part and does everything possible to transform herself into a little boy, but she is never truly convincing. This is not really the fault of her acting. Her mannerisms, her way of walking, her fights are all boyish, but she always looks just like Mary Pickford. In the end it has to be said that while Mary could transform herself into a little girl years younger than herself, she just could not make herself look like a little boy. She's far too beautiful and has too many curls. She remains, as always, the girl with the curls.

The black and white print on the Milestone DVD is pretty good. It seems to be complete and while there are quite a lot of scratches, this wear and tear is never really distracting. The image is clear and bright with a good amount of detail. I was generally pleased with how the film looks. The DVD has a good orchestral score by Nigel Holton, well played and appropriate to the mood of the film. As extras there are two photo galleries. Little Lord Fauntleroy may not be one of Pickford's very best films, but once you get used to Mary as a little boy, it becomes a lot of fun and essential viewing for her fans.",1111276800,11,1817,4.440119760479042
549418,5,6303011594,"You can't go too wrong with a popular and much liked story like ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" - the poor boy growing up in 19th century New York who learns he is heir to an earldom in England, and whose childlike charm and good-naturedness softens the heart of his embittered and grumpy grandfather.  And who better to play the role than Mary Pickford who won the title of ""America's Sweetheart"" for her popular and pleasing personality, her impressive acting skills and roles that appeal to everyone.  In ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"", Mary showcases her brilliant talent for playing children - both girls and boys - as well as her versatility by also playing the role of the little lord's mother.  The camera work for these scenes - mother and little lord together - is perfect, and overall this film is faultless with sharp, clear picture quality and a most beautiful orchestral score perfectly matched to the film.  The scenes of the old English castle, village and surroundings are also perfect and a pleasure to behold, but above all it's Mary Pickford's charming and charismatic portrayal of the unassuming and loving Lord Fauntleroy that makes this film a real winner.  Her expressive pantomime skills really bring the role of the young Lord come to life, and you won't mind one bit that she looks much more like a girl than a young boy.  Next to ""Stella Maris"" in which she also plays dual roles very impressively, this is the best Pickford film I've seen so far, and I'm hoping that the other Pickford releases that Milestone Films has planned for later this year will be similarly enjoyable.  There are slide shows of stills and other memorabilia on this DVD as well, making it an excellent Mary Pickford edition, and one that will surely appeal to many viewers.",1110153600,5,1763,4.779605263157895
549419,4,6303011594,"The 1921 version of LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY was one of Mary Pickford's biggest hits and it's easy to see why. It features her in a dual role as the little lord and his mother giving her the opportunity to showcase her acting talent in two very different roles as well as letting us see the two types of parts she would play for the rest of her career. While split-screen roles had been done many times before (Pickford even did it in 1918's STELLA MARIS) seldom has it been done as well as it is here. Not only are the double exposures perfect but the perspectives used really highlight the difference between child and adult.

Mary was one of the most powerful people in Hollywood at that time and she always worked with the best technicians available. The sets are stunning, the lighting equally memorable and Charles Rosher's cinematography is in a class by itself. The direction is credited to Alfred E.Green and Mary's brother Jack (according to Mary he was the inspiration for her portrayal of Fauntleroy) but you can be sure that she did a lot of it herself without credit. Claude Gillingswater as the old Earl of Dorincourt gives a marvelous performance every bit the equal of C. Aubrey Smith and Alec Guiness in later versions. As wonderful as Mary's child performance is, I never once thought of her as a boy (I'm sure audiences in 1921 didn't either) but she definitely was the character of Fauntleroy so it really doesn't matter. Her work as the mother is just as good showing that she could play adult roles when she gave herself the opportunity.

Sadly it is that aspect of her acting which has been forgotten over the years. Milestone's release this year of several Pickford films in restored editions to go along with those already available should help to rectify this oversight and return Pickford to her rightful place as one of the silent screen's top performers and not just ""Little Mary"", the good little girl caricature that most people think of her as today.

The film isn't perfect as some of Mary's concessions to her 1920's audience like the fight at the end seem out of place with the rest of the picture. Nevertheless LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY is the ideal introduction to Mary Pickford for those of you not familiar with her work while it gives those of us who are one of her best vehicles in beautiful condition. Special mention should be made of the fine orchestral score that Nigel Holton has provided for the film. Thanks again to Milestone Films and The Mary Pickford Foundation for making this and other Pickford releases available on home video.",1109376000,5,2578,4.686534216335541

7836237,4,6303011594,"I saw this first as a child. And fell in love with the story and of course identified with young Earl Fauntleroy (I was a nice chidl, I guess), the extraordinary Freddie Bartholomew. His interaction with mother Dearest and newly found Granpa is very touching.

The plus side is that this German Kino Blu-ray seem to be the same as the American one. It is the best possible print and I was really pleasantly surprised - especially since the Blu is very cheap. Great value for money, a good film story for all the family. A Little Classic.

Bartholomew is my favourite child actor (alongside Dean ""The Boy with Green Hair, Stars In My Crown"" Bartholomew). It is so great to find that your young self was not wrong falling in love with these films and the actors in your age group (at least in the films).
If you do not believe me, that even child actors are artists, listen to this:

""his performance is a valid characterization... almost unique in a child actor, and, indeed, in three fourths of adult motion-picture stars""
- Ring Lardner, Jr.

The best acting btw C. Aubrey Smith and Bartholomew is in the scene where the old Earl comes to tell the young Earl that he can stay even if he couldn't be the Earl. (All is explained in the film!).
Henry Stephenson is marvellous as Havisham, very Oscar worthy if there was any sense in Oscars.",1504656000,,1338,4.493827160493828

I tried reversing back a few seconds to see if it would correct itself, but then the picture just froze. I had trouble getting the disc out of the DVD player too. Don't buy from this vendor - Alpha Video. I hope at some point this movie is released in a reliable version. This one doesn't even deserve one star.",1494115200,,448,4.22093023255814
