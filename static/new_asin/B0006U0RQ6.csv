2195504,5,B0006U0RQ6,"Ali Zaoua: Prince of the Streets is a powerful film about a young boy's dreams of becoming a sailor, to live on and island with two suns setting at the same time, influencing his closest friends where to bury him. The coastal city of Casablanca's inner city gang life has all the emotions of human feelings of violence, drama, hatred, joy, and love of dreams even in the harshest environments. Nabil Ayouch's directing skills and outstanding young actors illustrate a picture few want to see and yet a teaching tool about life; all children have dreams. The few adults in the film have important supporting rolls to Ali's friends and to a lesser degree to the rest of the group. This film might be seen by older children or college students in appropriate class settings and can handle the raw emotions seen in this film.

Though very sad, I thought the way the stories of brotherly love, hope for the future and desire for family weaved in and out of one another was very well done. The little actors in this film were amazingly good (and I read many of them were and are actual street children who were recruited for this film) and the cinematography was beautiful.",1327363200,,1167,4.610576923076923
2195505,4,B0006U0RQ6,"A variation on Hector Babenco's great 'Pixote', this follows the same theme
of abandoned street kids in (in this case Morocco as opposed to Latin America),
being played by real street kids.

But ""Ali"" is much less gritty and naturalistic in style, if not story.
Beautiful widescreen photography, some playful animated moments, and a
slightly less despairing feel (although it's still pretty dark).

A young street boy is killed, and his friends try to figure out how to
get him properly buried, while fending off attacks from the local
street gang, finding the boy's mother, etc.

Very well acted for the most part, and has it's share of touching,
heartbreaking moments. But it also feels manipulative and 'moviesh' at
others. Certainly a good film, if not quite at the amazing level of it's
ancestors.",1312329600,,802,4.970149253731344
2195506,4,B0006U0RQ6,"I do not usually see a lot of Moroccan films. In fact, this is probably my intoduction to the cinema of Morocco and Nabil Ayouch's little film is a great intoduction to a culture that not may not be familiar to most casual viewers.

Ali, Kwita, Omar and Boubker are street kids living near the port in present day Casablanca. Their existence is not an easy one; it would seem that their only souce of pleasure is sniffing glue. The four boys have just run away from a violent street gang that seemsto include most of the homeless kids in the city. One day early in the film Ali who had dreamed of being a sailor is killed by a random act of violence. It is up to his friends to find the means to bury him and to try to keep his dreams alive.

Ayouch utilizes both his non professional actors and his location quite well. At times the cinematography of Vincent Mathias can be quite striking. The story though a simple one has great resonance. These kids even though living in a very foreign place have the same dreams and problems of children living anywhere. They look for the same things anyone is searching for: a family and a place to belong.

The film is presented in standard definition with good subtitles. Film Movement is to be congratulated for bringing to wide attention a film that few would have seen outside the international festival circuit. Included with the feature film is the short film by Mike Mills The Architecture of Reassurance.

Well worth checking out.",1311206400,,1478,4.52434456928839
2195507,4,B0006U0RQ6,"There is always an unsavory side of city life for the poverty-stricken, and the most vulnerable to the pain of life are the children.  This is explored with gritty realism in Ali Zaoua, and while the struggle is certainly in the spotlight, the indominatable spirit of hope is recognized even in the spirit of the most down-trodden.  I showed this film as part of a middle school world cultures class, and had to skip past a scene or two, but the students resonated with the struggle and celebrated the hope.  The fact that none of my viewers spoke Arabic did make it easier for me to turn off the subtitles when the language was a little too intense for my audence, and the students could still follow the action without losing anything of signficance.  I recommend the film, but anyone showing the film to younger audiences should be especially diligent in previewing the film.",1285977600,,878,4.681818181818182
2195508,5,B0006U0RQ6,"This is an incredibly moving portrait of the life of homeless children on the streets of Casablanca.  I first saw this four years ago at an Arab Film Festival, and just now watched it again, for the first time after living in Casablanca for three years, learning the culture and language.  While I question the complete accuracy of some of the translation, the main message comes across correctly, showing us the real Casablanca.

That other movie by the name- it has nothing to do with reality.  Nice movie, but it's done on a soundstage in Hollywood.  Honestly, there should be a clue when the moving moment in the movie is when there's a battle between the German and French national anthems- and no mention of the Moroccan anthem.  If you want to see a movie of what life is like in Morocco, I'd recommend Hideous Kinky.  If you want to see what life is like in Casablanca, I'd recommend this one.

There are many beautiful places in Morocco.  Casablanca's not one of them.  It's a large, gritty city of six million.  The best thing it has going for it are the unofficial three million poor living in shanty towns- for there is great opportunity in Casablanca to care for the poor and work with them.  This movie vividly describes their plight- and the poorest of the poor who don't even have a roof over their heads.  There are truly children everywhere, begging when the taxi pulls up, sniffing glue, and looking for food.  Unique among major Arab cities, Casablanca truly does support two red light districts.  This is a hard movie.  There are scenes in it you never want to see again- and made all the worse because they are reality.

There is also poignant joy in the movie, interspersed wit magical realism and simple animation showing the hope the children create for themselves in the midst of squalor and evil.  Even without glue they find moments to laugh at.  Nabil Ayouch, the director, scored a coup in using actual street kids for performances, one of whom (the soccer player) went on to star in the most popular Moroccan sitcoms, like Laila Fatima.  It gives greater veracity to the ups and downs of their lives.  At times the soccer player breaks out into song, using the national anthem with new words of simple love.  The joy in cora, soccer, and the support for that greatest of Casablanca teams, Raja, is palpable.  Soccer brings the moments of greatest bliss in the movie, where the soccer player brings a smile that can light up the entire block.  This is true Casablanca.  In three years, the happiest I ever saw men on the street is when Morocco advanced to the Finals of the Africa Cup.

This movie is filled with awfulness, for it is too true, too real.  It is about the hardship of life.  And finding the small parts of good, even if you have to imagine them.  In Moroccan Arabic, Raja means ""Hope"".

2195509,5,B0006U0RQ6,"Director Nabil Ayouvh's 2nd movie focuses the daily activities of street urchins in Casablanca Morocco.  These young boys lived together in vacant lots and participated in gang life, begging, prostitution, glue sniffing and violence.  Ali Zaoua ran away from home when his mother was propositioned to sell his eyes.

The movie begins when four boys break away from their gang leader, Dib.  As the thugs attempt to win them back, Young Ali Zaoua is killed when hit in the head with by a flying rock.  We don't get to know who Ali is, as he is killed immediately, but we learn about him as the boys worship him as a hero and a prince as they embark on a journey to bury him with dignity, on a private island he dreamed about. Ali's dream was to be a sailor.  The friends hide his body in a hole/cave so that only they can bury him at sea.

It is said that Director Ayouch recruited non-professional actors, actual street kids, unlike the oldest boy, a deaf gang leader who is a real actor.

You will see depiction of the rough life these boys endure, but you will explore their childhood innocence and their dreams.  It is a sharp contrast.  We see this film through the eyes of the children. It is a moving film about friends who live between children surviving on the streets with brutal realities and fables and fantasy.

This 2000 movie has won numerous awards.  The DVD subtitles are very clear to read.  There isn't much on the special features, and lacks much about the director or any commentary.

See this movie with family, although there is harsh language, it may not be suitable for young children.  The message is powerful and moving. ....Rizzo",1123804800,19,1655,4.562711864406779
2195510,5,B0006U0RQ6,"Best film I have seen in this year (2002). A Story of friendship and hope. Childhood struggles in an orphan life. orphan kids wander the streets in the city's abandoned construction sites. Takes place in Casablanca, Morocco.",1104451200,10,224,5.081081081081081
2195521,3,B0006U0RQ6,"I could have given it more stars because I enjoyed it; it is just that there are many similar movies (about kids growing up tough) and I have no background in film criticism. However, I will say the children who acted in this film were every bit as convincing as the ones in Slumdog Millionaire (a much higher-profile film) and the Kite Runner (ditto). Also that I don't get tired of seeing this genre because it is a solid reminder of how easy our lives are in comparison to so many places on the planet. Yet, how 'dignified' these meaner lives remain!",1429574400,,553,4.431372549019608
2195522,5,B0006U0RQ6,"A very lyrical movie depicting the hopelessness of life of street urchins in 3rd world countries (the specific place is almost immaterial).  Well acted by actual kids picked off the streets which makes it almost unbearable to think that they are really not acting but being the part.  Although the movie ends on a high note, it really doesn't offer any hope.  Fantasy and dreams are all they have to look forward to in life.  Makes me ashamed of what the rest of us are always griping about which are mostly trivial next to what they have to endure constantly without complaint.",1428364800,,578,4.637254901960785
2195523,5,B0006U0RQ6,Superb. How does a director find or get children to be so real? Painful work. Well worth enduring the pain.,1416614400,,107,4.4
2195524,5,B0006U0RQ6,"Wow, I was in awe of this family.  As a child I had many of the same feelings and issues Ali experienced.  My father/step-father: abusive.  My step-father told me that I thought that I was better like Ali's dad.  I lived in my world of books, imagination, curiosity.  How did other families live?  I saw other mothers love their children like Ali's mom.  i lived in my head and didn't like to talk, just observe like Ali.  No one realized that I was a high index myopic until I started 1st grade.  I've always had a loving heart I identified with Ali there too, and hoped that would be his saving grace.  The mother touched my heart.  Would Ali survive, prosper?  Hope so.",1414454400,,672,4.373983739837398
2195525,5,B0006U0RQ6,"I agree with what has been said - this is a raw movie, but curiously, it doesn't let room for pity. It touches you, but it doesn't require you to be sad for the boys. You see them in rags but you also get to accept them, because they accept them. None of them self-pities, so neither do you. Kwita's determination and ""vision"" is what pulls the friends together and gives meaning to their acts, it kinda gets them through the day, rearranges their values - now the most important thing is Ali's burial. Overall, highly recommend it, with the note that some scenes can be really tough to watch.",1413590400,,593,4.4

The unfortunate side is that this movie shows the reality that many kids around the world are living.",1368316800,,430,4.512820512820513
2195530,5,B0006U0RQ6,"One thought kept tugging at me while I was watching this film...no way could an actor perform the way these kids did. Not possible.  These had to be the authentic, lost children of the streets. I was right.

The movie is raw, gripping...most of all...intense.  The person who plays a gang leader who torments a few kids who dared to leave his gang is one of the most frightening persons I have ever seen on the screen.  The eyes.  When you see the eyes of a man who is indifferent to the suffering of others, you will feel a fear that is unlike anything else.

The plot is simple, but the film is not simplistic.  When one of the kids is accidentally killed by a rock thrown by members of his former gang, his few friends decide to honor him as a prince...to give him a death equal to the fantasies of his life. To turn him into a sailor who sails his boat to a special island where there are two suns.  The kids really have no clue how to do this - but ultimately with the help of a captain of a small boat, they succeed.  No movie I have ever seen memorializes the significance of a ""proper burial"" better than this film. Subconsciously, it echoes one of the themes of Homer's ""Iliad.""

Ali Zaoua ran away from home...partly because his mother was a prostitute, and he was ashamed.
It appeared that she still cared for her son deeply, but I could not understand why she did not come back to fetch him from his miserable life on the streets.

This movie pulls no punches about what life is like for a homeless child in an urban jungle - trading sexual favors for cash, eating discarded food, begging, stealing, selling cigarettes, sleeping under a filthy bedspread. All of this depicts an ugly portrait of poverty that Hollywood prefers its viewers don't experience.",1359417600,6,1767,4.422839506172839

There are strong scenes of love, regret, loyalty, cruelty, misinterpretation, responsibility and misplaced responsibility.  Adults come across as flawed, complicated, makers of poor decisions, yet able to feel and participate in everyday heroic acts.
