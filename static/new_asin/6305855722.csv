1084337,4,6305855722,This was the end of Flynn's swashbuckling career. He looked old in this film but better than he did in Roots of Heaven. The filming and sets were Engish and well done. I like Flynn so enjoy all his movies even those of his later years.,1407542400,2,235,4.130434782608695
1084338,3,6305855722,"One of the hardest Errol Flynn movies to find nowadays.  In the sunset of his career, he made this entertaining historical action film that depicts the challenges facing Prince Edward as he tries to keep the peace in France.  Unlike ""Crossed Swords"" (1954) and to a degree ""The Master Of Ballantrae"" (1953), no trace of campiness here.  Director Henry Levin effectively maintains the script's serious tone with only a few lighthearted moments added to break the tension.  Fans of director Richard Thorpe's works like ""Ivanhoe"" (1952) and ""Knights Of The Round Table"" (1953) will enjoy this picture since it is in the same vein.  By the way, one of the joys of this feature is watching a young Peter Finch in action.  Parenthetically, he wouldn't become a star until four years later in the drama ""The Nun's Story"" (1959).  Also, note this is the only swashbuckler that Errol Flynn made that was shot in widescreen.  That's icing on the cake for his fans.  At any rate, ""The Dark Avenger"" blends sword fighting, jousts and noble heroics into a memorable struggle to quash an uprising.  {No DVD or blu-ray release on the horizon for this title, unfortunately.  So, just the film review at this time - circa 2013.}",1377993600,2,1211,4.8019323671497585
1084339,3,6305855722,"Errol Flynn's final swashbuckler is colorful, fast-paced escapism  familiar stuff yet nicely done in CinemaScope. ""The Warriors"" (1955) offers plenty of action, a distinguished British cast and Henry Levin's vigorous direction. Flynn looks older than his 46 years, but delivers a spirited performance. Shown as ""The Dark Avenger"" in Europe, ""The Warriors"" deserves a widescreen DVD release.",1359331200,,390,5.842105263157895
1084340,4,6305855722,"An Errol Flynn film I had not seen before. A very god action film from the fifties with Errol still at his best. The Warriors was his last swashbuckler. Very familiar, but good enternainment,  even inn VHS. it is in colour. Recomended.  guitarman1943.",1328400000,,251,4.813953488372093
1084341,4,6305855722,"I think it's one of Flynn's best older films. I like the Armor and Costumes, very nice. The fighting in armor is not too mild and not too clumsy and looks brutal enough for what a Knight would really do. I like the movie shots of the charging knights.

Plot is good, solid medieval action. Edward Prince (Errol Flyyn) has won a battle over the French, now he stays in France to rule it. Comte Robert de Ville (Peter Finch) and the other French Knights don't want English lords lording over them. So they first try to assasinate him, then kidnap his lady, Joan of Kent(Joanna Dru. Edward tries to rescue her, fails, has a swordfight, joins the enemy to learn their plans, tries to rescue her again, fails, ect, until the final big battle where the good guys have to win if it's going to make sense.

I do want to say that Errol is 46 in this film. That is not too old an age to fight as a knight. In the medieval times, the aged warrior was the most qualified to lead younger knights. He had the experiance that was vital, for there was no proffessinal Arny as we know it in those day. A man with experiance in battle was more important than youthful energy. Nobles in those days would go into battle, on horseback in the front line, well past their 70th year. So Errol running around in armor at his age is not an error. In fact, The real Black Prince Edward was still fighting wars at Errol's age, abeit he died of illness when he was 7 days short of his 46 birthday. And Errol was a heavy drinker so maybe thats why he doesn't look the part. But I thought it was ok.

The love story has stuff added in such as the kidnapping, but the love between Errol and Joanna is not contrived, as history tells us Prince Edward and Joan of Kent loved each other very much. Prince Edward had a crush on her since boyhood as they grew up together. but when he grew up he decided after he to marry her off to a lordly friend of his. But after he told Joan his intention, she professed her deep love for Edward, perhaps in a similar love scene as the movie shows it, kisses and all. Edward decided Joan was better off as his wife, not his friend. They were first cousins so that was frowned opon, but the Pope gave his permission so they were married in England and THEN went to France to rule.

In the movie Joanna Dru is too young compared to Errols age. The real Joan of Kent was two years the elder of Edward. So she should be 48 years old in the movie.

Peter Finch is a great French Knight, not a demon rebel. You can feel sorry for him, how he hates seeing France under the thumb of Edward. But in the end, you don't shed a tear at his death. But you say, there were brave men on both sides and this movie jolly well shows that bravely.

Watch it for a good time.",1171152000,18,2756,4.142056074766355
1084342,5,6305855722,"This movie is based on history of England's fight against France for Aquitaine during the 100 Years War. 'Errol Flynn' in the role of Edward, Prince of Wales (the Black Knight) is England's greatest hero of the period. 'Peter Finch' is Comte Robert de Ville the Frenchman who refuses to surrender. Joanne Dru is Lady Joan Holland (playing the love interest).  I love this movie. It is ""Flynns"" last romantic swashbuckler. Unfortunately ""Flynn's"" drinking has taken it's toll on his health. Even so I find this to be a great movie, well told & ""Flynn"" is great in the role. I recommend this movie to all who are either fans of ""Flynn"" or in history. The actors bring this little bit of history to life in wonderful detail. The sets & costumes are beautiful. The musical score is magnificent. Yvonne Furneaux is perfectly charming as Marie. Don't allow others who look only for perfection to sway you. You will love this movie & will watch it again & again. When I saw this movie for the first time the screen stated that it is recommended by the National Education Association.",981676800,31,1076,4.663157894736842
1084343,3,6305855722,"This was in fact the last cinema outing for Errol Flynn as a  swashbuckler.(there did lay ahead a few television appearances during the  period of 1956-7 where Flynn played various costume roles).
No one would  deny that this is the least of Flynn's costume dramas.  Although he is  playing an actual historical character, Flynn, who was 45 at the time, does  appear bloated and somewhat tied in several scenes.  In particular his  sword fight with a young Christopher Lee, is a sad reminder of his previous  encounters with Basil Rathbone and Henry Daniel.
However, there is still  much to enjoy in the film.  The cast is good, featuring Peter Finch and  Michael Horden.  The picture is well mounted (at least for a British  picture of the 1950's) with excellant exterior shots.
Although not hugely  successful when it was first released, the film did gain some respectful  reviews (particularly in the New York Times).
The film is not as  enjoyable as the 'Master of Ballantrae' made in 1953, however it is by no  means disgrace and is worthy of respect by any Flynn fan.",965433600,11,1073,4.770491803278689

1084420,5,6305855722,"As already stated a Knight in his mid 40's was the most valued of Knights on the battle field & history doe's indeed speak of Knight's well into their 70's riding into battle so Errol Flynn is age appropriate in this film!!!  I read the reviews stating Flynn was paunchy & old & I was pleasantly surprised because he looked quite good as the ""Black Knight""!!!  Whoever said the colors were washed out & the sound was bad certainly didn't get what I got!!!  The movie I just got done watching was a explosion of vivid color, this movie looked remastered to me & the sound was crisp & clear!!!  COLOR GALOR!!!  Set towards the end of the hundred years war the costumes are historically accurate as are the wide variety of weapon's, with all the knights & Dukes flaunting their lineage by family crest's & colorful design's & patterns the battle field was a veritable riot of color from individual tunics to the crested plumed basinets to their shields & sheath's!!!  Contrary to popular belief this is a period in history when the Knights were as colorful as peacocks!!!  I don't know how I missed this movie for so many years as I am a huge fan of Sword & Sorcery, Sword & Sandal, & historical film's ! They really out did themselves with costume design's & set work on this film, the outside views of the castles are stunning as well as the interior shot's this was no cheap B rate film. There is enough action with personal duels & sieges to keep the swordsman of the house happy & yes you get to see Errol Flynn swing a Flanged Mace, Battle ax tossing & some sword swinging as well as some lance work & Javelin throwing, I guess if this was Errol Flynn's last swashbuckler he was determined to Swash-A - Buckle !  Meanwhile  the extra's in the film are using Long & short halberd's, Bow's, Great Sword's & even some early cannon blast's !!!  This is more than worthy to add to your collection if you like Medieval movies, Knight's & sword swinging it is a must have!!!! As I stated before I love movies with sword's & I am so happy to add this to my collection had I known about it earlier it would have been in my collection years ago!!!  This movie ranks right up there with the best of this genre & period of film making!!! The color & detail's are beautifully opulent!!! I think I am going to go watch it again, there's so much detail I am sure I will see something cool each time I watch it!!!!",1414368000,17,2401,4.337053571428571
1084421,5,6305855722,"Have been checking and waiting a long time for this movie to be released by WB. Good enjoyable movie.  It's the last swashbuckling movie that Flynn made during that era of the 50's, great costums and spectacular battle scenes which at that time were all real actor's and extra's etc,  Unlike the films today battle sequences etc., which are all computor generated to make caste of thousands and unrealistic.  Don't make movies like this anymore. Own similar movie ""Sword of Lancelot"", cast of thousands.",1410566400,4,503,4.964285714285714

When will Raintree County (1957) and The Big Fisherman (1960) be released, in particular the former?
Keep up the great work.",1408060800,3,398,4.782608695652174
1084424,3,6305855722,"""The Warriors"" (AKA ""The Black Prince"", AKA ""The Dark Avenger"") is among the last and (sadly) least of Errol Flynn's swashbucklers.  Flynn is entertaining as ever -- if past his prime -- but the story is mediocre.  It concerns Edward ""The Black Prince"" of Wales's defense of the French province of Aquitaine after his father, Edward III of England, defeats the French and claims Aquitaine for the English Crown.  Some of the French nobles, led by Peter Finch, are unhappy with the new state of things and stage a rebellion which centers around capturing one of the Black Prince's old acquaintances, along with her two young brothers -- this in an effort to draw out the Prince (Flynn) and capture him.  That isn't a lot of plot for 85-minutes and the story never really catches fire.

Despite the misleading and grotesque cover image, ""The Warriors"" is pretty tame.  The swashbuckling action is rather lackluster, with uninspiring choreography, despite a midnight joust, some swordplay, a pitched battle, and lots of chases on horseback.  Mostly, though, it's the story and pedestrian direction that disappoint.  After it was all over, I was just left wondering, ""What was that all about?""

As for the print on this Warner Brothers Archive Collection DVD-R: it's inconsistent, with the picture going soft periodically and the color shifting.  In other words, the print wasn't restored and is in need of it -- especially at the rather steep prices for these ""on-demand"" DVD-Rs from the big studios.

I'm a big fan of classic swashbucklers, and love Flynn's best work, but ""The Warriors"" is a letdown.  It's not terrible, but it's just so-so, and worth getting only if you're a dedicated collector of swashbuckler films.  3.5 stars.",1407801600,23,1730,4.986062717770035
