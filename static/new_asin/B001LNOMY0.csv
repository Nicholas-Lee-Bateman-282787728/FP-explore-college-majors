8319011,4,B001LNOMY0,"I watched this movie (Matinee Idol) on Amazon Instant Video via Roku. It was advertised as being the movie ""Matinee Idol"" from 1928 and directed by Frank Capra, but it was not that movie. Instead it was a 1933 British movie of the same name staring Camilla Horn and Miles Mander. It was an interesting old mystery-crime-romance, but NOT one directed by Frank Capra. I think the 1928 Capra film was a silent movie, but I do not know since I still have not seen it. By the way the most famous name I noticed in the 1933 movie's credits was David Lean as the film editor, who later directed ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and many other films..",1392163200,,631,4.401709401709402
8319012,3,B001LNOMY0,"MATINEE IDOL is a British production from 1936, probably of interest to film buffs because it was edited by David Lean who went on to fame with such films as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. Put out by Sinister Cinema, there is little that sinister about it. More soap opera than murder mystery it is a backstage mystery in which practically every major player confesses to the murder at some point. The matinee idol is Miles Mander, who played in some of the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes mysteries, the most notable THE SCARLET CLAW. He fits the part as the aging romantic lead. Camilla Horn plays the lead actress, but her real life would make a much more interesting film. She was German and Swiss, reputedly a mistress to a leading Hollywood mogul in the 30's, had four husbands, stood up to Hitler, and received a lifetime achievement award in Germany for her long film and stage career. The quality of the DVR is typical of an old film that has not been remastered.  This film is worth a look if you are interested in 30's British cinema.",1379116800,,1027,4.551351351351351
