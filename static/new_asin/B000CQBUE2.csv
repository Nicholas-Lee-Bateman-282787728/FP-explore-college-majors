8361937,4,B000CQBUE2,"Dalkeith is a true ""she'll be right Aussie town story where the locals bring an unlikely outsider (a racing greyhound) to win the coveted race.
A feel good ending satisfies our prime craving that good will overcome all adversity and the underdog (no pun intended) will win the day against all odds.",1352851200,,298,4.75
8361938,5,B000CQBUE2,"I saw this movie on TV (in Australia) just recently and thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It's a wonderul, heartwarming story set in a retirement centre where the residents are dying of boredom. They are given a greyhound and thats when the fun starts. Veteran Austalian actor Ray Barrett is superb, especially in the court room scene at the end. Compliments must also go to James Benedict as David who gave his character a wonderful fresh performance. If you get the opportunity to see Dalkeith, do so as it will bring a tear to your eye. Good direction, good editing, good music score, 10 out of 10. Come on give it a release in the USA.",1168214400,,649,4.508474576271187
