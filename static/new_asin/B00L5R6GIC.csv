6471375,5,B00L5R6GIC,This is an interesting an fun biographical documentary of a guy I never heard of. Shep Gordon might not have been famous himself but he sure did hang out (and manage) an impressive and diverse group of characters. Highly recommend. Great first effort from Mike Myers (...who knew?!),1414713600,,282,4.895833333333333
6471376,5,B00L5R6GIC,"Great film, what a vicarious journey through the sixties and seventies, and to come out the other side with a deep spirituality intact.  I enjoyed this as much as the recent documentary about the more well-known legend David Geffen, but this film will give you a more positive outlook on humanity.  Highly Recommended.  Mike Myers' commentary on a recent Marc Maron podcast was very illuminating regarding the background to this incredible documentary and true labor of love.",1406592000,4,475,5.142857142857143
6471377,5,B00L5R6GIC,"A fascinating character study.of a man you never heard of, until now. Can you represent major musicians (Alice Cooper, Janice Joplin), wheel and deal big contracts, womanize & party 'til you drop, and still have integrity? If you are Shep Gordon you can.
Mike Myers has captured the character as well as the glitz and craziness of Shep's world.",1404345600,6,344,4.8474576271186445
6471378,5,B00L5R6GIC,I just returned from seeing the movie. Mike Myers did a superb of putting together this documentary with great flashbacks. Very fast moving with great clips coupled with current high quality video and audio. Great dialog delivered by very well known personalities. And Shep Gordon has a great speaking voice. Technically superb.,1404000000,6,328,5.326923076923077
6471379,4,B00L5R6GIC,"""Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon"" (2014 release; 85 min.) is a documentary (written, produced and directed by Mike 'Austin Powers' Myers) about the life and times of Shep Gordon, one of the legendary managers in the entertainment industry. As the movie opens, and after some general introductory comments from people like Michael Douglas, Sylvester Stallone, Alice Cooper and others, Gordon tells in his own words how it all got started, back in 1968 when he really wanted to become a probation officers, and even took and passed the California Probation Officer exam. But when it became clear he didn't fit in with the others at the CA juvenile facility he was assigned to, he dropped out and drove to LA where he checked into the Hollywood Landmark Hotel, and promptly befriended Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. It was Hendrix who 'pushed' Gordon into managing (""You a Jewish boy?"" ""Yea"" ""You should become a manager."" ""Okay"", ha!). Gordon's first important client was Alice Cooper, then still toiling into obscurity, but not for much longer. Gordon was 21 at the time, if you can believe it. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, even if Shep Gordon may not be known to you at all, you are in for a finger lickin' good time with this documentary. The man was arguably one of the most connected people in the Hollywood entertainment scene, and apparently one of the most respected and beloved. Besides managing many stars in the music and movie business, Gordon practically single-handedly started the 'celebrity chef' scene when he befriends French chef Roger Verge and later agrees to manage him and many other chefs. Second, given the 40+ year relationship and bond between Gordon and Alice Cooper, we get to see quite a bit of the Cooper saga with fascinating insights on how Cooper was able to break through, with the ideas from Gordon playing a crucial role (and hence it's a nice compliment/contrast to the recent ""Super Duper Alice Cooper"" documentary). Third, the documentary does not shy away from the personal side: while we see Gordon having relationships with Sharon Stone and other well-known women, in the end we see Gordon alone. Says his assistant: when he wakes up after the surgery and sees me beside the bed, it's clear that he wishes it was not me, his paid personal assistant, whom he'd be staring at"", wow.

This showed up without any pre-release hype or advertizing this past weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening where I saw this at was okay but not super-well attended. ""Supermensch"" is not a 'dirty laundry' type of documentary, so if you think you'll be hearing/seeing a lot of gossip on the artists managed by Gordon, you will be sorely disappointed. If on the other hand you are interested in getting an intimate portrait on one of the most successful managers in the entertainment business, then this is for you. I enjoyed this from start to finish. Quite a nice debut for first-time director Mike Myers. ""Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1403568000,15,3202,4.841240875912408
6471390,5,B00L5R6GIC,"We heard Shep Gordon interviewed on an podcast, and found him rather interesting.  We purchased the dvd and enjoyed it!  Purchased a second dvd for a friend who is way into music - he loved it.",1480896000,,193,4.333333333333333
6471391,5,B00L5R6GIC,"Although I was familiar with the topic myself, I shared the viewing experience with my out-of-the-loop sister and a good friend from Germany.  They both loved it, especially the friend from Germany, who had no familiarity with Entertainment Agents, Producers, Concerts or the Mensch lifestyle!  She was enthralled!  So, you could say I was very satisfied, not only because I got to see my friend Shep portrayed in the film, but because the film captured something so human and insightful, that it captured the interest of three very different viewers.  Kudos!  Very well done!",1474934400,,576,5.085106382978723

6471410,2,B00L5R6GIC,"Like a true Anti-Social Personality Disordered person even he knows he is, Gordon himself gleefully regales you with his history of lies and deception: From pretending to be the manager of The Left Banke, to trying (and failing) to get his own artist arrested for publicity, to screwing over those he represented to give himself a bigger cut (the original Alice Cooper band), he admits it all in one form or another.  Sociopaths know how charming they can be to most people, they know full well that their charisma will win out over their criminality. This is a testament to how well loved sociopaths are in the USA. Hell, even I'm moved enough to give this two stars rather than one.",1445212800,,684,4.652892561983471

Shep presents as a very kind man but a man who cared too much about others and not enough about filling an important need in his life and that being a women who loves him for who he is and not what he could do for their stardom , like the raw food women.",1440288000,,317,3.953125

One of the best ""rockumentary"" docs I have ever seen. No. Make that the best one I have EVER seen. Mike Myers did an outstanding job with this.

6471441,4,B00L5R6GIC,"Engrossing biography of a man so self-indulgent, so self-loathing and so resolutely disconnected from nine-to-five American society, the empty world of the celebrity is possibly the only place he could have thrived and, eventually, found his version of nobility. This may sound like a nasty criticism of such a smart and generous character, but you have to see Meyers' documentary to understand that it's not (and getting me to feel a little sorry for a womanizing, substance-abusing multi-millionaire is no small task). In terms of garnering undying loyalty from the showbiz community, Scientology has nothing over the 'Supermensch.' 3 1/2 stars.",1430697600,2,647,5.415841584158416

You have to see it to believe it !!  Mike Myers did a remarkable job producing and directing this biography.  I don't want to spoil it for you by describing any of the crazy antics or celebrities that share their favorite stories about Shep.  Trust me.. I'm a hard one to please and this true story is so compelling you won't want it to end.  You'll just want to follow this guy around to see what he's up to next.",1430006400,,573,4.117117117117117

Circumstance, Happenstance and Chance make Sheps life one of the most unique you will ever get a view into. I smiled in wonder the entire time watching it. I wish I was Sheps friend.
The only downside to the dvd is there are NO bonus features. Lots of interviews and stories so surely there was a lot left that didn't make the film. So a many more stories or details would have been appreciated to see.
Watch it!",1426550400,,511,4.333333333333333
6471446,4,B00L5R6GIC,"Who cares about the Hollywood super-agent who made Alice Cooper famous?  I didn't think I did, but in his directorial debut, Mike Meyers (yes, that Mike Meyers) tells the epic saga of a legendary Hollywood insider, Shep Gordon.  Great documentaries not only have an interesting story to get you in the door, but also have a surprising extra gear which elevate it to another level.  In this case the star studded client list singing Sheps praises are usurped by Sheps own search for meaning and happiness which are equally compelling.  It is understandable why Mr. Meyers fell under Mr. Gordons spell as we all do in this engrossingly uncommon documentary.",1426032000,,655,4.927272727272728
6471447,4,B00L5R6GIC,Wonderful serendipitous movie. Oh how reality is often way-stranger than fiction. Shep Gordon is an amazing guru with a sound buisiness-maketing mind with a slightly twisted but ethical phillosophy on life. His intimacy issues are the only thing that kept him from achieving a higher degree of joy and true happiness. I thank both Shep and Mike Meyers for allowing us to enter their world and also enjoy their uniquely karmatic experiences and journey.,1424476800,,452,5.121621621621622
6471448,4,B00L5R6GIC,"Shep Gordon's life is half happenstance and half determination. Seems like he was in all the right places at all the right times. But that's not to say fortune fell in his lap. This guy has a helluva lot of moxie. The first half of the film records his rise as a rock promoter. His various promotional techniques were ingenious and hilarious to see. This guy was a force of nature, all the while operating within a purple haze. The second half of the film deals more with his personal life and his desire of having a family of his own. Throughout, many celebrities declare their admiration and fierce loyalty to Mr. Gordon. Wish we had more Shep Gordons in the world today - it would be a better place to live.",1423785600,,710,4.386363636363637
6471449,5,B00L5R6GIC,Such a great movie! Saw it in the theater and loved it so much we had own it and share it.  Such a good story of such a good guy!,1423353600,,129,3.3

6471451,4,B00L5R6GIC,"Shep Gordon has managed many huge acts, first in the music business, and then in other areas ranging from film to cooking. He has also befriended just about every heavyweight in Hollywood. And yet it seems he's managed to do so while still being a good guy, a nice guy, an honorable guy.

There are on camera interviews with Alice Cooper (who was Shep's 1st client, and who he has managed for 45 years!), Mick Fleetwood, Michael Douglas, Tom Arnold, Emeril Lagasse, Anne Murray, Mike Meyers, Willie Nelson, Sylvester Stallone and Steven Tyer. But the best interview subject is Shep himself, who has tremendously entertaining, often funny and occasionally tragic anecdotes about his many years in show business. Among the most interesting are the various clever, and sometimes amusingly devious ways Shep would raise his clients' public profiles and help make them stars.

There's a genuine wisdom and even a spiritual side to Shep, who befriended the Dali Llama, and spent a week cooking for him as a way of giving back. Ultimately Shep realized, sadly late in the game, that there was more to life than work, and that he was missing out on having kids and a family.

Not a 'change your life' film, but it's always engaging, like listening to the most fun and intelligent guest at a great party.",1420675200,,1295,4.798206278026906
6471452,5,B00L5R6GIC,"I heard about this on and episode of Marc Maron's podcast with Mike Myers and immediately bought it on how interesting it sounded. Although it can be a little repetitive in some spots the story of how this dude puts his clients of friends and family before himself is inspiring. Going in with little to no information about Shep would be the best way to view this, though even if you are familiar with his clients and the great things he's accomplished throughout his career this is still a great feel good watch about a truly great guy looking out for his clients and their art.",1420588800,2,579,4.471698113207547

After watching this I now know why. what a tremndous person Shep is. Again for all his success, money and friends it was sad to see SHep didn't manage to have a family of his own. (although he considers many his family) The only downside of this doco is it is a bit short and you feel as if you want more and there would be more to this interesting story of this interesting man.
