1740319,4,B00006B1HJ,"Great stuff, glad to see it on DVD (why are there no Dora or Little Bill episodes on DVD???). The Rugrats stuff really came off as unpleasent and unfunny to either my wife and I or our daughter, who loved the other material on this disc.",1039996800,3,237,4.173913043478261
1740320,5,B00006B1HJ,"All of the episodes with the exception of the Rugrats are really great.  As usual, Dora and Little Bill and Blue really are fun wholesome worlds for my 3 yr old son to visit.  Thankfully, with the DVD format I can block out the chapter on the Rugrats.",1038787200,12,251,4.208333333333333
1740321,5,B00006B1HJ,My daugher (13months)could watch this dvd over and over again if I let her. She specially likes the Dora episode.  But all the episodes are great (I think) The bonus Rugrats episode is also great.  This is my daughters favorite DVD so far even more than Barney (and that's saying alot).,1035936000,6,286,4.588235294117647
1740322,3,B00006B1HJ,Take 3 very educational shows and put them with a worthless show in which the kids all act and talk like [imbeciles] and this is the dvd/video. They should keep NickJr. and Nick on different videos.,1032393600,31,198,4.527777777777778
1740323,5,B00006B1HJ,"I think i like Nick Jr Rugrats,Nick Jr Blue's Clues,Nick Jr Dora,and Nick Jr Little Bill. Rugrats use to be a Nick Jr Show. Rugrats was a Nick  Jr show from 1991-1994. Rugrats started in 1991. That's when my Big sister kellie started First Grade. Late 1991. Now,Rugrats is a Nickelodeon Show. It was a Nickelodeon show from 1995-2002.it's been on for a while.the other shows were always Nick Jr Shows. Blues Clues was always a Nick Jr show. 1995-2002. I like Nick Jr Dora. It was always a Nick Jr Show. From 2000-2002. I also Like Nick Jr Little Bill. It was always a Nick Jr show. From 1998-2002. Made by Paramount 90th Aniversary (A Viacom Company),Klasky Csupo,And Nick Jr DVD.Starring Steven Burns (1984-) as himself in Blues Clues.",1030406400,4,736,4.661538461538462
1740344,5,B00006B1HJ,"My son is very pleased with this DVD and has been watching it over and over.  Thank you!  He doesn't care for the Rugrats bonus episode, but loves Dora, Blues Clues and now Little Bill.  That one was new for him and it's very sweet.",1383004800,,232,4.111111111111111

1740347,5,B00006B1HJ,I don't know why all of you people are dising rugrats but along with dora it is my sons favorite show which is the main reason i bought this.. My 3 year old loves it and he loves rugrats he didn't really like the little bill but he loved the other shows on it.,1288051200,,260,3.8333333333333335
1740348,5,B00006B1HJ,"My almost 2 year old loves this dvd.  He can sit through all three episodes and so can I.  Truly rare.  I must admit the Little Bill episode depressed me a bit.  Little Bill cries his little heart out because Alice the Great is stranded in Cincinatti on Christmas Eve (don't worry it all works out in the end).  On Blues Clues, Steve visits his neighbors who are celebrating various winter holidays.  Dora delivers a present to Santa and sings Feliz Navidad.  All very enjoyable.  I highly recommend.",1242000000,,500,4.6022727272727275
