5384860,2,B00A6UHBJM,"The Wolfpack is back, and they are on a mission to save one of their friends, who has been kidnapped. They must track down Chow, and return gold that he stole in order to save Doug. This final film in the trilogy is a slight improvement over the annoying second film, but there is not enough here to completely redeem it. They play the character idiosyncrasies for as many laughs as they can, and a cameo by Melissa McCarthy is mostly wasted, as this one just does not stand up to the crazy original. Part III is not terrible, but it is not very good, either.",1370822400,3,559,4.283018867924528
5384861,3,B00A6UHBJM,"I'm not sure what critics were expecting to see when they went to see The Hangover Part III, but clearly they didn't see it. Words like `deplorable,' `tasteless,' `unfunny,' and `indecent' have been used to describe the film, not to mention the all too repeated yet inevitable phrase `what happened in Vegas, should have stayed in Vegas.' I, on the other hand, must profoundly disagree with this vastly baffling majority. The Hangover Part III is a fitting final chapter that is far from `tasteless,' and in fact even expresses some rather poignant truths about friendship.

The Hangover Part III wisely turns its back on the ""what happened last night?"" premise, and freshens things up with a new conflict, although it still involves looking for Doug. This time the Wolfpack assembles for an intervention for Allen (Zack Galifianakis) following the sudden death of his father (Jeffery Tambor) and a terribly public mishap with a giraffe. While enroute to a mental rehabilitation facility, Allen, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) are abducted by mobster, Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall orders Phil, Stu, and Allen to track down Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) who stole $21 million in gold from him or he'll kill Doug. It seems oddly hypocritical that series like the Harry Potter films are allowed to break with formula and get significantly darker over time, yet when a film like The Hangover Part III does the same, there is an uproar. Nonetheless, this new direction allows the characters more room to breathe as they commence an enjoyable manhunt that takes them to California, to Tiajuana, and of course, to Vegas!

Various nods to the previous two films are sprinkled throughout in enjoyable ways and even the Marshall character is fittingly introduced. Jeong's role is substantially larger in this installment, and while his presence felt far too forced and substantial in the second film, he shines in Part III. It is true that there are not as many laughs in The Hangover Part III as there were in the original, but it also has a different tone where laughs are sacrificed for occasional moments of intensity. Nonetheless, the film is still a comedy, and the laughs that happen are strong and surpass the lazy unoriginal ones from Part II. In fact, this film minimizes its references to Part II to such a degree that this film could be considered Part II, and Part II could be a sort of appendix or something.

The argument for whether Part III (or Part II) was necessary is a larger issue that does not only apply to this set of films but to all part II's and part III's. Thus, on the merits of what is presented, The Hangover Part III is a successful and entertaining film. It devises a reasonable premise, offers a clever plot-twist or two, and even provides some insight on friendship. The latter part is perhaps the film's least successful endeavor, as it pounds the audience over the head with various versions of Trent Reznor's song ""Hurt;"" however, a scene towards the end utilizing that song does have a ring of truth to it.

Director Todd Phillips listened to his critics and detractors after Part II and gave them exactly what they wanted in Part III, yet his new vision is not being embraced. While the franchise has seemingly run out of steam, and a Hangover Part IV is incredibly unlikely and ill-advised, Part III is a perfectly good send off to these characters that deserves to be seen even if the ""hang"" is ""over."" B

The Hangover Part III is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 40 minutes. While there is no stinger after the credits, definitely make sure you stick around for about a minute after the credits begin rolling.",1370131200,,3684,4.768025078369906
5384862,3,B00A6UHBJM,"For the viewer who, like me, reveled and rolled with laughter at the characters, surprises, spring-loaded moments of subtlety, uproars, and mad funnies of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B002RVCCUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>&nbsp;and its sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover-Part-II-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy/dp/B004EPZ06G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover Part II (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)</a>, this Part III is much less than all that.  But it still is worthwhile.  The first two movies were so over-the-top, that the allusions and invocations of great memories already are worth the price of admission to The Hangover Part III.

Alas, the plot and characters here lack the width and contrasts, and the element of surprise is pretty much gone.  But compared to all the schlocky stuff out there, this is a movie I'm glad to have spent a couple hours of my life seeing.  Once is enough, though.  And if you're not already a devotee from those first two, I would not start with this one.

5384863,3,B00A6UHBJM,"I was hoping ""Hangover 3"" would be a remake of 1 and 2 when Alan (Zach Galifianakis) avers ""I will never change."" For those who complained that ""Hangover 2"" was too much like the original...be careful what you ask for.

This film builds upon the events from the first film for plot and humor. Our threesome must capture Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) or else Doug (Justin Bartha) will be killed by crime boss Marshall (John Goodman). Goodman revives his famous potty line from the ""Branded"" scene of ""The Big Lebowski"" which might go unnoticed among the 100 or so F-bombs dropped in the film.

The plot was boring compared to the other two features. This film relies on the delivery of over the top jokes from Zach Galifianakis which incorporates bizarre dark humor. Without this, the film is a bust. Good use of classic rock lyrics incorporated into the film.

No need to rush out and see this on the big screen.

5384864,4,B00A6UHBJM,"I liked both #1 & #2, so i was of course going to see this.

The whole thing starts with a parody of Shawshank Redemption (involving Chow) so the laughing started right away for my part. There's enough absurde situations here to make me like it almost as much as Hangover 1 & 2, even though there is no alcohol involved this time (it actually isn't). And ""backtracking"" is actually a big part of the story in this one: To take a quote directly out of the movie: ""You have no idea of the chain of events that were set in motion that night...."". This of course refers to one of the nights in the previous movies. Im not gonna say which:-) To keep the excitement. This is (black) humour at its best in my opinion. And YES i consider it black humour: When you think about the whole thing being about the subject ""hangover"" while you watch the intro with its dramatic classical music....",1370044800,13,882,4.345454545454546
5384865,4,B00A6UHBJM,"Moviegoers want sequels, that's why they are made. As fans, we want to see more and learn more about the characters we know and love, but no matter how good that sequel is, not all of the fans are going to like it. If the movie is too much like the first one, the fans say it's the same movie, but if it's too different, they say it doesn't fit the story. The only place the writers/producers are going to win is at the box office, because no matter the reviews, they know people are going to come and see it. The Hangover Part III is getting terrible reviews from fans, because it's not what they expected. It's not as funny as the first one or even the second one, in fact, this film is much more dramatic than the rest of the films in the series, but it not necessarily a bad thing. Alan may not have had a ton of funny lines and Stu's girlish screaming may have run it's course, but this was still a really good story. Using flashbacks from the original, Todd Phillips introduces us to a part of the story that we didn't even know existed until now. This time, they skip the hangover and the wolf pack needs to go on an adventure to capture Mr. Chow. Four years ago, Chow ripped off another gangster and that gangster kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the wolf pack can bring him Chow. The story was solid and included some of the comedy we love along with dramatic elements and even a couple of really exciting chase scenes. No, this film was not the hangover we've come to love and expect. The clever one-liners aren't there, there's no wedding to prepare for, and the stakes are much higher this time, but all in all the story was very solid and the performances were fantastic. This film was a great way to end the story of the wolf pack, yet many fans and critic alike insist on comparing it to the first one. This film is much different than the original, too different in the opinions of many. If you want to compare Part III to the original Hangover, than no it's nowhere near as good, but if you look at it based on it's own merits, it's a pretty solid film, albeit much different from what was expected.",1369699200,12,2129,4.2592592592592595
5384866,2,B00A6UHBJM,"HANGOVER PART III is an aggressive and mean-spirited movie.  This is not to say that it isn't funny...some of it is very funny.  But director Todd Phillips has made the mistake of thinking that we enjoy the Hangover films because we want to see our three stars behave like some kind of modern-day, R-rated Three Stooges.  Taking painful blows.  Insulting each other.  Being generally misanthropic and unlikeable.  In fact, what we loved about the first film had just as much to do with the camaraderie between the 3 main characters, as well as a healthy dose of the element of surprise.  It was a comedy with a mystery (what DID happen that night, and where the heck is Doug?).  The comedy came first; the mystery was the vehicle through which surprising things could happen.  (Best of all...Mr. Chow jumping nude from the trunk!).  But we laughed and we enjoyed our time with these hapless and unusual characters.  HANGOVER PART II rehashed the plot, but raised the stakes and raised the violence level.  It now was meant to be amusing when a character is raped or another is mutilated and his surgical career ruined.

III is a full-fledged action flick, with bits of comedy thrown in.  Animals and people die...violently.  Frequently.  The tone is thus very aggressive.  And it's mean-spirited because the characters really spend much of the film hating each other.  They seem to bristle being in the same scenes together...and I don't just mean the characters.  Bradley Cooper is dialing it in, and seems to be hoping he'll slip under the radar.  Ed Helms mostly yells about how fed up he is with everything, and the actor seems to mean it as much as his character.  Zach Galifianakis fares best, but he's also just relying on being as weird and inappropriate as possible, rather than being a real person.  That being said, almost every funny line in the movie is his.  I suspect I could count on my ten fingers the number of genuine laughs in the film.

And HANGOVER III makes the mistake of essentially making Mr. Chow the 4th star.  He's in the film almost as much as the other guys and he officially wears out his welcome within 10 minutes.  His character should only be doled out in small doses, and while he was quite funny in #1 and annoying in #2, he is flat out UNWELCOME in #3.  I think Ken Jeong can be a very funny performer, and he's capable of some real acting...but by the end of this film, I truly hoped he might be killed off.

John Goodman is on hand in the role of a bad guy, and he's given nothing funny or remarkable to do.  How do you as a screenwriter or director waste John Goodman, one of the most naturally affable and engaging actors in film?  Melissa McCarthy makes what is initially a welcome appearance as a pawn shop owner who takes a liking to Galifianakis' Alan.  But her character grows tiresome.  Another victim of director Phillips' inclination to leave the camera on just a couple of beats too long.  Sometimes uncomfortable silences are funny; sometimes they are just uncomfortable.  Guess which way HANGOVER PART III leans?  Heather Graham makes a return appearance and even Jeffrey Tambor is briefly on hand.  Pretty much everyone looks vaguely unhappy to be in this film.  The whole enterprise reeks of ""Contractual Obligation.""  I wish they'd felt obligated to provide more laughs.

It's sad to see the series end this way, with ever diminishing returns.  If you're a big fan of the first two, I'd say you should go ahead and drag yourself to this.  Maybe.  It's sort of a depressing mess.",1369612800,17,3534,4.64297253634895
5384867,1,B00A6UHBJM,"Every summer, theaters are seemingly filled with sequels - desperately trying to recapture the magic of the original, not to mention break box office records.  However, it's quite unusual for a trilogy to be released over the span of four years, unless they were shot together.  In 2009, The Hangover was the breakout hit of the summer and currently sits atop the film charts as the highest grossing comedy of all-time, yet instead of focusing on the quality of the story, the studio opted to cash in on the popularity of the first film by quickly releasing a sequel in 2011, The Hangover II.  Met with negative reviews, The Hangover II was basically more of the same, so the news of a third film being green lit was a bit of a surprise.  In any event, here we are - in the summer of the 2013, and Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis have reunited for one last run as ""The Wolfpack"" in The Hangover III.

Todd Phillips (The Hangover, The Hangover II) is back in the director's chair once again as The Wolfpack - Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are on a mission to track down Chow (Ken Jeong), who recently escaped from prison.  When a drug kingpin, Marshall (John Goodman), is desperate to locate Chow and the gold he stole, Marshall kidnaps the Wolfpack and forces them to capture Chow and deliver him and the gold back to Marshall or their friend, Doug (Justin Bartha) - who is being held hostage, will be killed.  Heather Graham, Mike Epps, and Jeffrey Tambor also star in supporting roles.

From the very beginning, writer/director Todd Philips said he was going to use a completely different template for The Hangover III - and sure enough, he did.  However, some characters are not meant to be tinkered with so dramatically, especially in the ""conclusion"" of the trilogy.  These characters, that many of us have come to know and love over the last few years, are hardly recognizable in this film - although quite of bit of time of this third film is spent showing flashbacks to the first two films, clearly trying too to tie these characters and their actions together in one big happy circle of continuity.  Sadly, Mr. Phillips has apparently lost his feel for these characters, making Alan and Chow more cartoonish and outlandishly stupid than usual, while making Stu and Phil borderline irrelevant.  It's pretty clear to say that the direction of the plot is easily visible, but it's just not supposed to be a Hangover film.

The first two films in the series are based on the premise of The Wolfpack having to find someone that they lost - and to an extent, the third film is spent searching for an individual, also.  However, all of this usually takes place after a drug-laced night of partying, which includes a variety of amusing interactions - whether it is a tiger in the bathroom, a tattoo on someone's face, or a baby in the closet.  So, the main problem with The Hangover III is there's no hangover, and without that hangover, there's very little amusement.  This story jumps right in with Alan being the focal point, now off his medication and more deranged than ever - followed by a kidnapping by a drug boss that happened to be mentioned by name in the first film (which, of course, leads to the first of several flashbacks to the first two films).  Then, The Wolfpack are kidnapped, forced to have a bunch of uninteresting interactions with the not-so-funny Leslie Chow, followed by Alan's lightning fast love story.  In essence, The Hangover III is a poorly written script with bad dialogue and relatively zero memorable moments.  Honestly, it's shocking how poorly executed this film is, so much so that most viewers would be perfectly fine with a forth film just to set things right.

The bad news about The Hangover III is that 98% of film is spent simply going through the motions and waiting for something to be funny.  However, the funny never comes - at least not until the final scene.  Like the previous films, The Hangover III also ends with a wedding, so without spoiling anything here, you'll just have to guess which one of the single cast members will be tying the knot.  Enter: Melissa McCarthy.  For those that don't know her yet, Melissa McCarthy really made a name for herself in the hysterical comedy, Bridesmaids, along with her CBS comedy, Mike & Molly.  Aside from the final scene of The Hangover III (which we will get to in a moment), Melissa McCarthy steals what brief scenes she does have.  In the event of a Hangover 4, and it's hard to imagine it not happening at some point, it would have the potential to be a complete laugh-fest if she were given a main role - since it's pretty clear after this film that Zach Galifianakis and Ken Jeong are less than amusing in their new leading roles.

Even though The Hangover III is atrocious, the final scene of the film (which is about a quarter of the way into the credits) will make it all worthwhile.  This post wedding scene will have you borderline crying from laughing so hard as you walk out of the theater.  It really is quite astounding that one scene can make an hour and a half of poor dialogue and stupid jokes worth the price of admission - but sadly, that's the case here.  If the film could have led with this scene and gone on from there, it would have easily rivaled the original film.  But, some things just don't work out the way you want them to.  Just give it a few years, and The Hangover 4 will have a green light.

Overall, if you've enjoyed the first two films and you're already emotionally invested in these characters, you'll want to see this film regardless of what anyone else tells you.  However, if you are the casual movie-goer that enjoyed the first film and simply tolerated the second - feel free to skip this one.  You won't be missing anything and there's certainly a plethora of better films to watch.

The Hangover Part III is a lighthearted, sarcastic film about a group of guys partying it up before one of their weddings. This is the third in the Hangover series. We already have the first two in our collection, so the third was a no brainer. This was a great film to put on to get excited for our own wedding and bachelor/bachelorette festivities. It is laugh out loud funny. My husband and I can relate to this style of sarcastic humor. It may seem brash, or crude, but you can't please everyone.

The style of writing is familiar so it sort of feels like a Hangover movie, but to put it simply, it's just not funny.  Several bits from the previous movies are rehashed so while easily recognized they are easily tired and worn out.  The guest stars (McCarthy, Goodman etc) are all over the top.  Of course Chan is over the top as well, which only really works when he has a back drop that isn't over the top.

5385042,3,B00A6UHBJM,"The Hangover Part III is one of those movies that I forgot about merely seconds after the end credits started to roll. I thought what I had just seen was a mirage of some sort. A comedy so unbelievably weak that it cannot simply serve as the end to one of the wildest saga of comedy movies ever made. But alas, there is just no way around how bad this final Hangover really is.

When the first film debuted in 2009, it opened to mixed critical reviews but to a strong word of mouth consensus amongst its audience and became one of the biggest unexpected hits of the year. It launched the careers of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifinakis from comedic players to top billing superstars. It was an even bigger hit on DVD, and a sequel was already in the works. The future really did look bright for comedy, and for Todd Phillips as his directorial career had now found itself in a massive resurgence.

Then, when the sequel debuted in 2011, audiences from across the country piled into movie theaters in hopes of another summer laugh riot. These hopes were quickly dashed when it was realized that the Hangover Part II was a carbon copy of the original. It was one of the biggest disappointments in comedy since Ghostbusters 2, but it did supply us with a few memorable quotes and inspired insanity if nothing else.

Now, we have The Hangover Part III. The question remains, why does it even exist? Who was asking for it? I couldn't name anyone who wanted anything to do with the Hangover after its disastrous second part. But, there it was, Hangover III. Whether you like it or not, your getting it. Whats more is that it isn't even remotely similar to the two movies prior to it. In fact, there's no hangover to be found at any point in this film (minus the end credits). Quite contradictory to the title, or even the WHOLE PURPOSE of the franchise!

Yeah, I guess Todd Phillips and co. were so terrified with what they received with the second movie, that they insisted on abandoning everything that constituted a Hangover movie and instead leave the memorable characters to revel in black comedy and senseless melodrama. If you can believe it, this movie is even more black than its sequel (and that movie included jokes about cocaine overdoses and the victims of the Vietnam war). Yes, we are forced to focus on the mad inner workings of Alan's mind, and why he is a burden to society and everyone close to him. Alan was once the most lovable inappropriate man-child the world has ever seen. Now, I wanted to strap him down and pluck every last whisker from his beard. We also focus on Leslie Chow's crazy antics again because. well LOOK ITS CHOW AGAIN!!! He's so crazy, right?

Everything else is just flavorless and boring. Even Melissa McCarthy can't save this mess. I'll admit that a few of the jokes made me laugh in a twisted Terry Zwigoff sort of way. But other than a few of the dark jokes. there's nothing really that enjoyable about this Hangover. So we bid thee, farewell. I don't think we'll miss you, Wolfpack.",1431993600,3,3033,4.537477148080439

In the movie,we get to follow the group of Phil,Stu and Doug as they try to help friend Alan confront a personal crisis. But as they try to accomplish this,the incident from Las Vegas came to haunt them.

The movie moves to another direction as there was no bachelor party and wedding. But in the end,it turned out to be somewhat a disaster as it moved from being a comedy into a dark action thriller that offers nothing compelling at all for the viewer. No wonder it was nominated for a Razzie. Overall,it was barely funny and it could even be classified as obnoxious and disgusting. One thing that could come up in the mind of the viewer while watching it is this question,""Is it time to end the franchise?"". I think that the overwhelming answer to it by then end of the movie would probably be affirmative for the good of the franchise.",1419724800,,914,4.440476190476191

5385322,5,B00A6UHBJM,"I've heard many people comment that Hangover 3 is a bad movie. The problem is, very few of them have actually SEEN IT. Face it, Hangover 2 was so bad that it drove many people away. The third installment is not as good as the original, but it's really pretty good for these reasons:
- It has its own plot, not the same formula that #2 followed, and the plot is clever and entertaining
- It does a good job of tying up the story line, the wrap up is satisfying
- There is significant character development, particularly Mr. Chow and Allen
The only negative to me is the silly, meant to be shocking but just plain bad taste and stupid ""after ending."" Turn it off before that and you will leave the trilogy with a good feeling, or watch it and ask ""why did they ruin it?""",1400889600,,768,4.195945945945946

5385324,2,B00A6UHBJM,"Trilogies are a business that Hollywood has imposed on us in these past years.
And this is not bad because some are really fun to watch. But this movie has nothing to do as part
III of a trilogy, because it has nothing to do with the basic theme of the first two.
I mean, the original idea of the Hangover was simple but great, and part I and II gave us
some really funny moments, and I am sure influenced many real life parties!

No hangover means that it is not funny nor interesting.
This is a boring movie, where the plot is predictable, with too many over the top scenes
in order to extract a laugh, and a lot of deaths, especially of animals for some reason.

How the producers managed to destroy this mega hit series escapes me!
You wait for the scene that they will wake up somewhere and things will go wrong and
you realize that this scene is not going to come (sorry again for the spoiler). It is not a good movie
even if you tried to think of it as not part of a trilogy.

What makes this watch able is the likeable crew ensemble in glorious action to do almost anything to save their pal while hunting furiously for the crafty Chow who is one hard to get weasel.

All is well until Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) appears back on the scene. This time he is a man on the run and this makes for another mayhem adventure.
Lots of actions pack scenes where the gang gets close to the edge and back. Doug even sparks a new love interest in Cassie (Melissa McCarthy).
Lots of funny scenes and low brow references that have become a hallmark of the Hangover series, there is even a bit of a teaser for a continuing of the series in the end credits, so stay tuned.

I dreaded another more ratcheted up version of the classic original, which was basically the case for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Part-II/dp/B004EPZ06G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Part II</a>.  Instead, THE HANGOVER PART III has a delightfully original plot, pays subtle homage to both of its predecessors, and even brings back a couple of characters from the original that are fun to say hello to again.  And even though there is an ominous undertone to this version (in the form of a threatening mobster, played by the always superb John Goodman), the Wolf Pack members demonstrate their ineptness over and over again, from getting trapped in the basement of a bad guy's mansion, to scooting down tied-together bedsheets from atop Caesar's Palace.  And is it ever fun to watch.

Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha all return as Wolf Pack members Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug. . .and no HANGOVER version would be complete without the outrageous antics of Lesley Chow (Ken Jeong).  Look for brief appearances from the original by Heather Graham (the now-reformed Jade) and Mike Epps (""Black"" Doug); and Melissa McCarthy joins the cast as Cassie, a dysfunctional romantic interest for Alan.  THE HANGOVER PART III gleefully blazes its own plot trail, refusing to be a copycat of its two predecessors--although the closing credits bring a brief blackout scene that promises to be--in two respects--rather jarring.  And based on the demise of a giraffe, some fighting roosters, and a couple of guard dogs, this is not a movie that PETA is going to endorse.  If this is indeed the end of the HANGOVER franchise, THE HANGOVER PART III is a more than worthy finale.  Nice to see that Wolf Pack ride off into the sunset.

The Hangover Part III was not bad but really lacked originality and felt like the producers were just trying to pump out another movie.  There are some very funny parts in the movie but if you are expecting this to be as entertaining as the first or second movie you will be disappointed.,1392595200,,338,4.435483870967742
5385462,4,B00A6UHBJM,"We've seen one and two, and while nothing will ever compare to HOI...this is still pretty funny.  Alan is especially funny in this one and if you liked two enough, this is along the same line.  Enjoy!",1392595200,,200,4.378378378378378

5385465,2,B00A6UHBJM,This was more action film than comedy and less comedy that a good action film.  The Die Hard movies are funnier that this one.,1392422400,,126,4.25
5385466,5,B00A6UHBJM,While Hangover Part II was lacking that is not the case for Hangover Part III. Not one to sit down and watch with the kiddos but around friends and your significant other this is a sure win!,1392422400,,190,4.162162162162162

Watch the trailer to Part 4 at the end... you'll die in anticipation!!  An absolute MUST HAVE item to your Blu-Ray collection, though once again, I can't stress this enough: get parts 1 & 2 along with this and watch in order.  I don't drink, though some friends were having beers watching with me and couldn't stop laughing!  A classic in the making of this series.",1392422400,,534,4.387755102040816

5385469,2,B00A6UHBJM,Hangover 3 is not nearly as funny as the first two. We were very disappointed. Two stars just because Bradley Cooper is in it.,1392336000,,126,4.291666666666667
5385470,3,B00A6UHBJM,"Hangover 1 was a downright surprise when I saw it and really became quite a classic.  Though they did roughly the same thing with Hangover 2, it was still very funny.

When it comes to Hangover III, there just weren't that many laughs.  Most of the events felt a little flat and didn't have the magic of the last 2 movies.  While it did offer a nice closing part to the trilogy, it just doesn't match up to the previous titles.",1392336000,,427,4.234567901234568
5385471,3,B00A6UHBJM,"Some parts were funny, some were stupid. It was okay, language was not necessay. A bit juvinelle, if you are in Jr. High School this is for you, ooh! But you don't have any money do you? Gdet Mom and Dad to approve first...hahahaha!",1392249600,,232,4.295454545454546
5385472,1,B00A6UHBJM,"I liked the first hangover, tolerated the second, but this one... boy was it bad.  Alan's character got old about 5 minutes into the first movie, and by this last movie he really was unwatchable.  I'm glad they didn't repeat the same plot from the others yet again, but they certainly could have tried a little bit harder.  I'm really not sure who would enjoy this movie - the only redeeming quality was that it was short!",1392249600,2,422,4.454545454545454

5385475,1,B00A6UHBJM,it has it's moments but it is much more action adventure than the hangover's we have come to love . skip it,1392163200,,107,3.909090909090909

5385487,5,B00A6UHBJM,Bought this as a gift for my 22 year old son and we watched it over the holidays.  I had heard that this one wasn't as good as the other two but as usual the critics are wrong!  We all loved this movie and laughed our butts off.  I think they did a great job with the storyline.  We were all happy and satisfied with the way they ended the series.  Is this movie going to win awards?  No but who cares!  Highly recommend.,1392163200,,421,3.9404761904761907
5385488,2,B00A6UHBJM,I don't recommend this movie to any one who expects it to be like the original. It's nothing about a hangover. sure their are funny parts but overall bad movie.,1392163200,,160,4.366666666666666
5385489,4,B00A6UHBJM,This movie wasn't quiet as good as the 1st movie but I really enjoyed it. I kept laughing throughout the movie-John Butcherine,1392076800,,126,4.7727272727272725

5385492,3,B00A6UHBJM,"Not as good as the first one.  A bit to over the top and contrived for my liking.  Yes I realize that was what the 1st one was all about but this seamed to forced.  I found myself not invested in the characters as much and frankly didn't really care how it was going to turn out as the story developed. Dont get me wrong, It had some funny parts but was weak overall.",1391990400,,367,3.9324324324324325
5385493,5,B00A6UHBJM,The movie for a third time was entertaining. Chow showed his true colors and more. He was badass and crazy serious. It wraps things up good.,1391904000,,140,4.423076923076923
5385494,3,B00A6UHBJM,I really enjoyed the two previous movies but this one was a disappointment.  I guess they used up all the humor they had and did the best they could with what was left over.  Rent something else.  This one's a waste of time and money,1391817600,,233,4.133333333333334
5385495,4,B00A6UHBJM,Ive seen them all i actually thought this one was funniest i laughed a few times more than the last two,1391817600,,103,3.9523809523809526

5385520,5,B00A6UHBJM,"Great movie and can't beat the combo pack. You get 3 versions of the movie in the Blu-Ray, DVD, and digital version. Definitely not a movie for kiddos and has a lot of crude humor but it is funny. Definitely different from Hangover I & II.",1391040000,,239,4.217391304347826

5385542,3,B00A6UHBJM,"But not totally stellar... it was worth the price of rental, but reviewing it two months later, I can't honestly say that I remember what it was about...  it's not a movie I would seek out to see again.",1390694400,,202,4.17948717948718

5385544,4,B00A6UHBJM,If you liked the other Hangovers you'll like this one too.  I am glad they are ending the series with this movie; the movie is worth the watch but you can only suspend belief for so long thinking how many times can these guys get a memory wipe via drugs or other means & then go on a misadventure.  It's a fun movie but glad they wrapped it up.,1390608000,,344,3.971014492753623

Some scenes actually drag on almost painfully. There are several awkward moments where the chemistry just seems off. BIG change from the seamless energy of the wolf pack's previous escapades. If your a fan, of course you must see it, just don't be surprised by the more serious tone, less hilarious end to what was once comedic greatness.",1389916800,,512,4.576086956521739

This is as enjoyable as the first two and also ends on a funny note. I don't think the Hangover series would have been as funny without this crew involved - from actors, to directors to music. Although this is supposed to be the last of escapades of the three friends, the end is good and leaves chances for a fourth if they ever decided to create more mayhem. Maybe a 10 year re-union if these actors have nothing better to do then. Facial expressions kill me in all three movies.",1389312000,,595,4.228070175438597

5385627,4,B00A6UHBJM,The movie follows right in line with the other two.  Even mentions things from the past two since some parts are looking back at the other two to help you see what really happened.  Make sure to watch the credits and see the an after the wedding clip.  Hilarious!,1389139200,,263,4.326530612244898
5385628,5,B00A6UHBJM,Very good movie really enjoyed love all the these movies will watch again ..none of them compare to the first. .,1389139200,,112,4.380952380952381

5385631,5,B00A6UHBJM,I thought the movie was just as good and funny as the first Hangover.  You won't be disappointed.  Ties in with the first nicely.,1389052800,,129,4.333333333333333
5385632,4,B00A6UHBJM,Love this final sequal in the Hangover movies - many funny moments!!  Some crude moments that are not suitable for children but adults should get a kick out of the adventures of the Wolf Pack!!!,1389052800,,194,4.542857142857143
5385633,1,B00A6UHBJM,"I knew this was going to be bad, but this movie was bad.  Maybe not as bad as the second one, but it was bad.  I honestly think the series could live if they kill off Bradley Cooper & the Asian guy and add Michael rapport and Wesley Snipes.  I bet we'll be seeing that as a series on Showtime somewhere around 2015.",1388966400,,315,3.9682539682539684
5385634,2,B00A6UHBJM,"I thought the first two movies were great, but this one I could have skipped. The movie was just not very funny.",1388966400,,112,4.136363636363637
5385655,3,B00A6UHBJM,"What made the first two movies fun were that there was a group of friends who got mixed up in a crazy adventure because of inadvertent drug use.  No one really got hurt in the first two movies and it was the recollection of their lost memories that made the story intriguing and at times, hilarious.  Part III deviated significantly from the formula of the first two movies.  This time, it was serious. Although the characters had funny moments, the trip was a somber one with no lost memories to figure out.  Several people were murdered in the process, and it was difficult to figure out at times who to cheer for.  The inadvertent drug use was saved for the very end, during the credits.

We were looking forward to seeing this third movie, but we were sadly disappointed.  Worth slightly more than 2.5 stars, and that is why it received a rounded rating of 3.",1388966400,,863,4.493589743589744

5385664,2,B00A6UHBJM,Just felt like this version didn't live up to the hijinx that carried the first two installments. Too slow and uninspired. The opening giraffe sequence was in very poor taste.,1388793600,,175,4.866666666666666
5385675,4,B00A6UHBJM,"Bradley Cooper is still so hot!!!! Still funny movie. Not as funny as other two, but still good. Probably rated a little high, but extra star for Bradley Cooper!!",1388793600,,162,4.620689655172414

5385677,3,B00A6UHBJM,Entertaining but not anything to race out and see. Typical hangover humor. More Chang than other 2 films. It was ok,1388793600,,115,4.523809523809524
5385678,3,B00A6UHBJM,"It was ok, I watched it mostly to see how they would end the series of movies.  The really funny part came at the very, very end of the movie.",1388707200,,142,3.7333333333333334

5385682,2,B00A6UHBJM,"This movie is proof of the eternal law that in movies that weren't planned as three-part epics, the third sequel is always the worst. Rehashed jokes, slow pacing, poor timing, lack of plot ... Hangover Part III has it all.",1388707200,,222,4.575
5385683,3,B00A6UHBJM,"Well, you can't beat part 1, and part 2 was pretty good too. But, I think with Part 3 it's just getting a bit old. If you're a Hangover fan then watch it...but doubt you'll watch it multiple times like you do the original.",1388707200,,222,4.068181818181818

5385685,3,B00A6UHBJM,I didn't think it was as funny as I and II.  But it was good.  I'd probably watch anything with Bradley Cooper in it.,1388707200,,117,3.8333333333333335

this one was funny, and I think it redeemed the last one.",1388707200,,169,4.451612903225806
5385687,5,B00A6UHBJM,I loved this movie.  Bradley Cooper is hotness incarnate and it's just a good movie.  The plot is a little different than 1 & 2 and it's a little more innocent.  Don't shut it off there is a bonus scene after the initial credits start rolling.  That you don't want to miss.,1388620800,,273,4.1923076923076925
5385688,5,B00A6UHBJM,The third Hangover does not disappoint.  It is pretty much the same ol same ol Hangover but if you liked the first and second one you will love this one.  If you loved the first one and hated the second one - this may not be for you.,1388620800,,233,3.8333333333333335
5385689,1,B00A6UHBJM,"A fan of the first two, this one does not have any of the charm and memorable moments that the first two had.

The appearance of John Goodman as the gangster, Marshall, was a pleasant surprise.

5385803,5,B00A6UHBJM,Saw this movie at the cinema and was pleasantly surprised that it was actually better than the second Hangover movie.

Definitely recommended!,1387411200,,335,4.793103448275862

5385830,1,B00A6UHBJM,Most unfunny movie ever.  Don't think I laughed once during the entire movie.  Very unfortunate after the 1st 2 movies,1387152000,,118,4.85
5385831,5,B00A6UHBJM,Not much to say. All of the Hangover movies are fantastic and worth watching. I recommend to everyone who needs a good laugh.,1387065600,,125,4.478260869565218
5385832,3,B00A6UHBJM,It's okay.  The first of the series is still the best.  There are some funny moments though I would have preferred less violence.,1387065600,,129,4.565217391304348
5385833,3,B00A6UHBJM,"They should have called this one Mr Chows story. The entire emphasis of the movie is on him rather than the four friends. In my opinion, it was quite a departure from the other two movies. Not quite as funny or irreverent overall, lacking in seamless transitions from scene to scene, and just overall, a let down when taken as part of the greater whole (the series basically). It was still enjoyable, and there were definitely some very memorable scenes (giraffe anybody?), but on its own, it was fairly average, and as part of the series, even more so. Definitely worth watching, but not wow worthy by any means.",1387065600,,613,4.63302752293578

Maybe it is the old 70s hippie in me or the fact that I made it thru the cocaine years and love Mr. Chow....in any event, while this one in the trilogy is definitely the weakest (really, couldn't you make better use of John Goodman's acting chops!)...it was an enjoyable movie to watch while on a plane ride to Jamaica.",1386979200,,415,4.2

5385875,2,B00A6UHBJM,I expected the same plot and the same characters but it felt like they were trying way too hard to be funny. It was a bit much when it came to the comedy side and I was expecting funnier,1386806400,,186,3.7948717948717947

5385883,2,B00A6UHBJM,"It may be hard to imagine, I know, but ""The Hangover Part III"" is an even worse movie than ""The Hangover Part II."" I won't bore you with the details of the ""plot;"" just know that the movie begins with a giraffe decapitation, then goes downhill from there.

Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms play virtual straight men to Zach Califianakis and Ken Jeong, the latter as the notorious Mr. Chow, whose theft of $20 million worth of gold from mob boss John Goodman winds up getting all the boys in trouble. The least member of the Wolf Pack, Justin Bartha, lucks out yet again by being safely escorted off-screen for most of the duration. Clearly, he has a more influential agent than the other actors.

The movie might have been better - and certainly more honest - if it had just been titled ""The Chow Show,"" since he pretty much takes over every scene he's in - and not always to the movie's or the audience's benefit.

If Hollywood had any mercy at all on its paying customers, it would immediately announce that there are currently no plans for a ""Hangover Part IV,"" nor will there ever be.",1386547200,2,1083,4.459595959595959
5385884,5,B00A6UHBJM,HILARIOUS!! I think this one may have been better than the 2nd one! I will be purchasing on blu-ray (previously saw on Amazon Streaming Video).,1386547200,,143,4.76
5385905,5,B00A6UHBJM,"One of the funniest movies of its time (part 1) was an instant classic. When the sequel was announced (part 2) I was first in line for the midnight screening.. and I was terribly disappointed. So disappointed that I decided that I would not waste my money to go see this one (part 3) at the theaters. Oh the number of potentially awesome franchises that have been ruined by horrible sequels only to have an even worse threequel.

One night I had some extra time and some extra cash to spend so I decided to take a risk and rent a random movie.. and there it is. I was so sure that I would hate this movie that I actually watched it alone instead of inviting friends over like I usually do. To my surprise this movie was good.. it was darn good! So good that I actually wondered if it was better than the original at some points (but then again without the original there would be no story to build on).

This is one of the best comedies I've seen all year and I'm so upset at myself for not going to see it at theaters. They completely redeemed themselves on this one with an awesome story, awesome jokes and an amazing wrap up to the entire franchise!

A definite must see!",1386547200,,1174,4.232142857142857
5385906,1,B00A6UHBJM,It had a thin/weak plot. Not sure why they made this movie. The movie studio must not have spent much on the script.,1386547200,,116,4.086956521739131

5385908,2,B00A6UHBJM,Slow moving and every other word was the F word. Not as predictable as Hangover II. Looks like they left the door open for Hangover 4 someday.,1386547200,,142,4.296296296296297

5385911,4,B00A6UHBJM,The third installment of what is promised to be the last of the series wraps things up nicely.  The focus here is on Ken Jeong's impish Chow and Zach Galifianakis' loony Alan and they run with the spotlight.  Good supporting turns by John Goodman as a vicious thug and Melissa McCarthy as a randy pawnshop owner.  Bradley Cooper does his best to maintain a straight face.  If you wait for the end credits Ed Helms' Stu experiences another physical indignity.  Future trivia question answer Justin Bartha as Doug does his best to be barely in the flick.  For those not offended by giraffe decapitation this film is for you.,1386460800,,622,4.660550458715596

5385931,1,B00A6UHBJM,"One of the worst movies in the series!  I mean since the series came out I actually enjoyed the first two movies looking forward to the third movie until I got to see it.  I will say that the first 30 minutes the movie fell completely out of line with the rest of the movies, there wasn't anything funny in it really nothing more than disgusting scenes that made me want to send the movie back to get the money back for it.

For once this is a Movie series that I can say that I am happy to see stop because if this movie was any indication on where the series would go to after everything then its not worth making any more movies.",1386201600,,632,4.04

5385934,2,B00A6UHBJM,"There may be spoilers ahead.

The concluding chapter of what started out to be a hilarious off-beat series, turns out to be a mean spirited, unfunny heist film.  The movie opens with Alan (Zach Galifianakis) cruising down the freeway with a giraffe being hauled in a trailer behind him.  Yeah, watch out for those low overpasses.  Next, Alan's dad (Jeffrey Tambor) drops dead after an argument with his son.  Then there are the hijinks at Dad's funeral.  Still not laughing?

Enroute to Arizona to get Alan some ""help,"" the Wolfpack are hijacked and kidnapped by mobster Marshall (John Goodman).  He holds Doug (Justin Bartha) hostage until Alan, Stu (Ed Helms) and Phil (Bradley Cooper) can find the elusive Chow (Ken Jeong) and retrieve $21 million in gold bullion Chow stole from Marshall.  From that point on it is a series of double crosses that most will see coming.  It leads the guys to Mexico and eventually back to Las Vegas where they have a weird but brief reunion with former hooker Jade (Heather Graham) and a surprise meeting with pawn shop operator Cassie played by Melissa McCarthy.

When I saw McCarthy, I thought now this is going to get good.  She and Alan make goo-goo eyes but nothing really happens.  Truly a lost opportunity.  The whole film is lost on me.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't thrilling, just a bore.  In addition to the giraffe, dogs & chickens also die, so if you are an animal love stay away.  Even if you're not, stay away.",1386028800,3,1460,4.658823529411765

It feels rushed, with not much plot, not many gags -- same players but they have NOTHING to work with. Shouldn't have been released, shame on the producers for just trying to cash in again.

Chao is back, and in his wake he bring mayhem and destruction to the lives of the pack. The plot started to feel a little repetitive though, and even though there were moments in which I found myself laughing, there were also several in which I started to be bored out of my mind,

5386161,4,B00A6UHBJM,"It almost feels like this movie was so different than the first two that it shouldn't have even been a part of the same series.  But at the same time, the movie was very well written and extremely captivating.  Consider this movie an action or heist movie with funny parts (rather than a comedy with a heist in it) and suddenly the film becomes worth while.

The characters seem very different than in the first two movies, to the point that it feels like the script was written by someone else.  Doug is taken hostage, so just like in the first two, we don't see much of him.  The character of Alan seems to have lost all of his humor and by the end of the movie, wants to change his ways.  While this provides a great end to the trilogy, it also seems very out of place.

What works for this movie is the unfolding of this huge problem that the Wolfpack finds themselves in.  Several times throughout the story the three will find themselves in a bind, and you'll wonder how they will ever get out.  While no one is actually ""hungover"" for this film, the story still carries the same sense of mystery as the movie progresses.

While the plot felt more like Oceans 11 than the third Hangover, the movie was still very entertaining.  This film had a lot to live up to following some of the most successful comedies in recent time, so it's understandable that fans were let down.  However, I still very much enjoyed this film and think it was well put together.",1383782400,,1460,4.366666666666666

I loved the original Hangover movie. At the time, I thought it was one of the funniest, most original comedy I had seen in a long time.  Hangover 2, basically repeated the story in a different setting and lost some of the magic that the original had.  And now Hangover 3, doesn't even come close to matching the effort of the 2nd installment.  The movie seems less of a comedy with its crude humor and laughs like in the first two movies and more of a dark humor action film.  if I hadn't seen the first two movies, I may have not been so disappointed because as a dark action movie it was average enough to watch but I kept expecting the jokes to happen that never did.

It seems like the writers ran out of original jokes that made us laugh in the first movie and went into a different direction with the same basic plot.

For all the things that the first movie did that worked, this movie lacks all of that.  Definitely a disappointment and maybe a good thing that they are ending this series before it totally ruins my memories of the first.",1383609600,2,1268,4.2761506276150625

5386194,4,B00A6UHBJM,"What can I say... it is the third Hangover film.  If you have watched one, or both, of the prior films... you know what to expect.  They didn't change the formula one bit.  They only wished to tie up all the story and plot lines and end the ""saga"".  Nearly everything about the prior two films is referenced or featured in the film, sometimes actually useful to the story and sometimes merely because they could.

If you haven't seen the first two, watch them first.  As I said, this is the wrap up film, tying everything together.  While you won't get lost watching this film as a stand-alone viewing, without knowledge of the first two films, you likely won't get the references and cameos.  Part III says it all, you'll only get a part of the big picture without the other two.

5386195,2,B00A6UHBJM,This is the worse movie of the 3. Would just rent it instead of buying it if you really want to see it.,1383523200,,103,3.5217391304347827
5386196,4,B00A6UHBJM,The movie was pretty funny and the story line was good.  I really like the different type of story the did this time.  Not just hangover stuff.  The ending was great!,1383523200,,166,4.290322580645161
5386197,4,B00A6UHBJM,This movie got some very bad reviews as being dark....Myself.  I can say yes it wasn't as constantly funny as the other two.  But if you look at the movie in its own rite and merritt.  I really enjoyed the film.  I thought it did wrap up the series quite nicely and enjoyed seeing all of the guys one last time on film together.,1383523200,,328,4.078125
5386198,3,B00A6UHBJM,Story good. Acting nothing spectacular.  Glad I didn't pay theater prices to watch. Not worth it in my humble opinion.,1383523200,,118,4.9
5386199,3,B00A6UHBJM,It wasn't a great as the first Hangover - but sequels rarely are!  It's still a funny movie with the same kind of humor we're used to in these films.,1383523200,,149,3.966666666666667
5386200,1,B00A6UHBJM,"Not even comparable to the other Hangover movies. If this was the original Hangover, there would be no sequels. Wish I had not spent the money to rent it.",1383523200,,154,4.344827586206897
5386201,1,B00A6UHBJM,Alan was especially arrogant and abusive in talking to or about others and Chow was not likable at all. I didn't find any humor in it  and the ending was disgusting.,1383523200,,165,4.32258064516129
5386202,3,B00A6UHBJM,"Still entertain even though 1 and 2 were much better.  It was worth a rental.  Chow is hilarious,  querky fun!",1383523200,,110,4.4
5386203,1,B00A6UHBJM,Distasteful and stupid.  This was not even funny.  Shame on those actors for participating in such a poor quality movie.,1383523200,,120,4.95
5386204,3,B00A6UHBJM,"I would actually say 3.5, if I could, but since I can't I thought rounding down was more appropriate. No new ground covered, but that is kind of a plus as the formula works. Only deviation is that it doesn't begin with a blackout. Oddly violent, though.  Sort of a SPOILER ALERT:  The first couple were crazy but nobody got killed.  People getting shot and killed very quickly sobers up this movie.",1383436800,,398,4.5
5386205,1,B00A6UHBJM,This was very disappointing. All the things they did were just like in part one and two. Don't waste your time or money,1383436800,,119,4.217391304347826
5386206,1,B00A6UHBJM,Not funny like the first one at all! Even worse than the second one. The only highlight is Bradley Cooper.,1383436800,,106,4.35
5386207,4,B00A6UHBJM,"I love these guys. The movie was full of twists and turns. They didn't use their typical format on this hangover movie, but that was part of what made if good. You should see this movie.",1383436800,,186,4.194444444444445
5386208,1,B00A6UHBJM,Absolutely unfunny. Everything that was brilliant and funny about the first two was totally lost on this followup. Seriously don't waste your time.,1383436800,,147,5.434782608695652
5386209,3,B00A6UHBJM,"The Trilogy to this series I would have to say is the second best. It was pretty stupid, but still decent. If you enjoyed the first and second than its definitely worth seeing once. I recommend the rental option over the purchase option, just my opinion.",1383436800,,254,4.543478260869565
5386210,4,B00A6UHBJM,Enjoyed it more than the 2nd movie and the story was fun.  I hope they do another one but I thought I heard this was the last one.,1383436800,,130,3.642857142857143
5386211,2,B00A6UHBJM,I had hopes that this would be better than part 2 which was a disappointment. This movie should have been titled 'Alan and Chow' as it took these two characters and focused almost exclusively. The dialog for Bradley Cooper's character was very limited except for dropping the F-bomb occasionally. It got to the point where characters that I had enjoyed seeing became annoying. There were a few laughs however I laughed the most during the credits with the end scene. Overall a real disappointment.,1383436800,,497,4.928571428571429

5386213,1,B00A6UHBJM,"It was boring and the premise is played out. The first Hangover remains the only good one. ""Hangover 3"" is not worth 4 dollars.",1383350400,,127,4.333333333333333
5386214,1,B00A6UHBJM,"I simply couldn't understand this embarrassing movie. John Goodman and Ken Jeong provided few funny moments, but that's all. It really doesn't worth a nickel.",1383350400,,158,5.36
5386215,3,B00A6UHBJM,"Predictable but still funny.  Repeats many of the same themes and jokes, but still worth the $5 dollars.  Leaves it open for another one.",1383350400,,137,4.666666666666667
5386216,5,B00A6UHBJM,"All the Hangover movies are fantastic. They are funny as hell, capitvating and well directed, produced and purely delightful. Hope they make the Hangover 4. After the first one, it is easy to bond with all the characters for the second and third one. I love when film makers make a second third fourth or more using the exact same actors each time to make it more culpable...this one was right up there with the first and second one...Enjoy!",1383350400,3,441,4.594936708860759
5386217,1,B00A6UHBJM,Very very bad movie.  A waste of money and especially time.  Break it down to 12 minutes of highlights and it would be okay,1383264000,,123,4.083333333333333

5386220,2,B00A6UHBJM,"This was cute - but too much on the serious side. The first 2 were hilarious! This was ok, but not as funny as the first 2. Now the very very ending where the dude comes out with breasts - that was hilarious!! Best part of the whole movie! I just hope it doesn't mean they have another movie on the way - they kind of lost their way on this one with the funny parts.",1383177600,2,366,3.8289473684210527

5386253,3,B00A6UHBJM,Maybe just some of the surprise wasn't there that was in the first round.

However literally almost every joke until the end falls flat.  I caught myself chuckling, but not really laughing, exactly twice in the first 90 minutes, until the last scene before the credits.  There is also a end-credit scene that was just rather outlandish than funny.  Alan, in particular, was strange in Hangover 1 and clueless, but well-intentioned.  Here, he is just a brat who thinks everything he does it funny.  Unfortunately, until he returns to character in that final scene,  Animal lovers in particular will be bothered by the (assumedly) fake cruelty to a giraffe, a chicken, and dogs.

It looked to me like it was just something the producers ad-hoc'ed together to cash in one last time on the popularity of the original movies. Maybe I'm missing a broader perspective. The situational comedy that made the first two movies as popular was definitely missing. Give it a try if you like though, everyone has different tastes when it comes to entertainment. The giraffe getting his head knocked off going through the underpass was a little funny in a weird kind of way (spoiler alert).

5386409,4,B00A6UHBJM,"I liken the first Hangover to the comedy genre what the Matrix was to sci fi. It was very original and the best thing to come along in a long time. There was no way any sequel was ever going to live up to the first movie, and that was made apparent when the best they could do for the second movie was to just copy the first one, just swapping out some of the jokes.

This, honestly would have been a far better follow up to the first movie. It expands on what happened in the first movie, even bringing back some of the same characters (even the baby as a 4yr old kid). The best thing about it, is that while it does refer back to the other movies, it was not a carbon copy of them. There is still a lot of crude humor and over the top situations in this one, so if you do not like that kind of stuff in a movie, or did not like the others then you will not like this. I think if you really liked the first movie, you can enjoy this one (even if you did not like the second one) if you are willing to accept the fact that it is not as good as the original.

As for extras, there are a handful of relatively short behind the scenes features, a gag reel, and some deleted scenes. Nothing too extensive, but amusing for those who like to go through that stuff.",1382140800,,1258,3.929411764705882

5386411,1,B00A6UHBJM,"Very disappointing third installment. The whole premise of the first two movies was waking up the next day and not knowing what happened the night before.

The clip during the credits was hilarious and reminiscent of the first and second hangovers, so I would hope they'd build off that clip and make a fourth one (if they were planning on doing another). This movie lacks any of the spontaneity and chemistry that the first two installments had. I easily sat through it because I like the characters, but as you watch it you no doubt will think to yourself how this movie just falls flat.

I know one thing about the creators of this series - they have some very big issues with Asian, and the Chinese in particular.  Like part II, there is non-stop racism against Asians to rival the movie ""Safe.""

Aside from Asian racism (which they won't complain about I am sure), this film is of course on par with most of Hollywood with the Illuminati agendas and the many references to them.  Of course there is the usual pro-homoerotic theme throughout the film in EVERY way (sick).  Too bad Hollywood (secret society) can't just make films without trying to brainwash.  Then there were the references to Illuminati events that they cause like the DEMEROL (their Michael Jackson hit) and the Vegas streets when Tupac (hit) was killed.

There is too much satanic activity in entertainment that I am kind of getting tired of watching their garbage.  The ending set it up for a possible sequel, but at the same time a close out if needed.  Given that this one flopped as people refused to get suckered after the last one, there should not be another, but this is Hollywood and they are known for endless sequels even if they do not turn a profit!  It's not about the profit for them, it is about the brainwashing, that is why MOST films involve endless killing, sex, drugs and racism!",1381536000,,1400,4.54183266932271

I don't regret watching it, but it's like the atmosphere is gone. Also it's important to mention that Zach Galifianakis wasn't too 'excited' to be in the third movie, meaning that at least one of the actors got nearly fed up or just tired of it all. Well, the ending after credits was priceless, like a happy ending, sort of. But there will be no part 4, sadly.

I didn't have the feeling of the guys being normal characters.  There has never been much of an explanation of Alan.  He has a long arrest history and does drugs, in this one a mental condition requires him to take medication.  The guys stage an intervention and they agree to drive him to a rehab clinic in Arizona.  From here, someone kidnaps Doug (for a friend they care about so much, he sure is missing from all the action) in exchange for Mr. Chow.  Now, it is a journey from Tiajuana to Las Vegas to find him and rescue Doug.  The plot isn't strong; there are great stunts, but it doesn't compare to the first movie.  Not bad for a watch though.

""This Is The End"" had jokes on top of jokes where this one was more tame. More about the plot of Chow. You could tell Cooper was holding back for some reason, maybe they wanted his character to be more mature. I think the filmmakers wanted to cut back since everyone slammed part 2 for being so similar. But like most 3rd installments in movies, this had to be different. The finale was bittersweet I guess as it will be the last. But know, there's more story than humor. I was hoping for more inspired laughs.",1381190400,,675,4.24031007751938

The usual banter wasn't really there, and when there was a ""back and forth"" it generally sounded dumb.  It looked like they threw the movie together and pushed it through production without really stepping back and asking ""is this funny?""  or ""does this seem a little pushed?"".  Almost like they wanted to ""just finish"" the trilogy.

Not a funny movie; not at all.",1381190400,4,458,4.746835443037975
5386617,4,B00A6UHBJM,"I didn't expect to enjoy THE HANGOVER PART III.  The first film rocked me out of my socks; it was a sucker-punch to the gut in a world or predictably tame non-Judd Apatow comedy, featuring a cast of relative unknowns partaking in hard-R shenanigans.  Then PART II came out...and it was the exact same thing.  The exact. Same. Thing.  Not in a good way.  So I had low expectations for the third.

Perhaps that plays in a role in why I enjoyed it so much.  You have to know what to expect; series rarely get better as they pan out.  Still, Todd Philips and company do something very interesting in PART III: they divert from their tried-and-true method.  Oh, we still have our three best friends on a wild goose chase, with perennial luckless schmuck Doug MIA.  But this time, the story comes with a unique twist: instead of trying to find Doug, the guys are trying to find their friend/nemesis Chow, thanks to a brutal drug dealer (John Goodman doing his spot-on thug thang).  This creates more of a heist comedy (a dark one, too; it's still hard-R), and injects a small dose of unpredictability into the mix.

The cast is still strong.  Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zack Galifianakis (who was kind of cloying in PART II; too much of a good thing, perhaps) hold the fort.  As Chow, Ken Jeong is surprisingly enjoyable.  In the first film, he was great, since his role was small; in the second, his part felt like a contrived rehash of better days.  Here, despite his more prominent role, Chow is surprisingly not annoying (well, not too much so), and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is great.  Throw in a great Melissa McCarthy cameo, and you've got the makings of a funny, funny film.  Suffice it to say, HANGOVER PART III isn't quite on the same level as the first...but it's a far cry from the laughless depravity of the second, and is sure to delight fans who are hoping the series will end on a strong (or at least not thoroughly disappointing) note.  Now let's just hope they don't come back and make PART IV.  (Although, if you throw DUE DATE into the mix, then this one technically is PART IV...but I digress.)",1381104000,,2126,4.472727272727273

Normal for Alan (Galifianakis) is not taking his meds and buying giraffes. After the death of his father the group gets together to take him to rehab. While on their way they get stopped and are given an ultimatum. They must find Chow, who has stolen money from this man, or their friend Doug will die. I enjoyed the first Hangover but didn't go crazy over it like everyone else. The second one I didn't like mainly because it was just a remake and rehash of the same jokes. I was a little leery going in to this one because of that. This one actually has a different plot and that fact alone made it better then the second one. Rather then piecing together the events of the previous night this one is about the events the group gets into trying to catch Chow (who in my opinion is the best part of the series). This isn't really a review that will convince you to watch or not watch since it is the third in the series, but I will say that I really liked this one more then I expected.

This is an unfortunate ingredient for failure. When a movie is not given a proper amount of time to be developed in the writing and plotting stage it can easily suffer from any number of things. First off the film is supposed to be a comedy and while the first brought the laughs by the barrel this one could hardly muster an occasional chuckle.

Chow was an initial fan favorite but I feel at this point they've abused his power of being a good side character by bringing him too far into the spot light.

5386689,3,B00A6UHBJM,"""To much disdain and lack of appreciation for this franchise, The Hangover Part III takes a little detour from the repeated craziness of the sequel (which to the surprise of those reading this review, I have not seen yet) for a wild goose-chase in Tijuana and back to Las Vegas. The film is notable to a certain degree for its divergence from the overtly comic formula to something more thriller-oriented and darkly humourous in content.

Much of the film focuses on Alan's problems building up when a giraffe's head gets decapitated, his father who passed away, and Mr. Chow, who returns again, to con the Wolf Pack and steal their money and goods. The film stands out slightly with its action-thriller type of plotline and its insistence on being moreover something that is bizarre and hilarious yet tense at the same time. John Goodman makes a surprise appearance here as a frustrated gangster and his presence here shines with irony and seriousness. The film's budget has been amped a bit to give a more cinematic edge to it with the action set pieces and locale.

Even with its pluses, nothing is really spectacular about this film other than Alan falling off a rope made of bed sheets and stuck between E and S of Caesar's Palace, Mr. Chow running away from a Thai prison, Melissa McCarthy appearing as a cameo and hinting something suggestively with a salivated lollipop, and Mr. Chow sniffing a spiked cocktail. The film, surprisingly, is more brutal and violent than its sex-heavy predecessors and especially for people not used to dark comedy or comic animal cruelty, Part III will especially be troubling.

Aside from that, if you are already caught up by now, Part III would probably be a better choice because of the differences that exist even if you have or have not seen Part II. In the end, the finale was worthy and was not too bad. It made me laugh and made me believe its zaniness toward the end but nothing more though.""",1373760000,,1941,4.702941176470588
5386690,3,B00A6UHBJM,"If you thought the first sequel was darker than the original, the second sequel ""The Hangover Part III"" gets much darker, with several deaths including that of one poor animal. I'm not particularly against the idea of deaths in as long as they are funny. Unfortunately, that is not the case with the third ""Hangover.""

Actually, we meet the ""wolf pack"" again, but this time the story has nothing to do with ""hangover."" Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) are threatened by an angry mobster named Marshall (John Goodman), whose $ 42 million-worth gold is stolen by Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong). With Doug taken hostage, Phil, Stu and Alan have to retrieve the gold, no matter what it takes.

The script for the third installment is written by Todd Phillips, who also directs, and Craig Mazin, one of the co-writers for ""The Hangover Part II,"" but it looks as if someone has borrowed a storyline from some other action thriller. Some jokes are funny, and Melissa McCarthy steals the show in a cameo role, but the creative energy of the original is sadly gone.

So, what you get here instead is the wolf pack members, now bland almost invisible with an exception of Alan. And lots of Mr. Chow. Both characters have become not only more eccentric, but darker and even meaner. This is not to say their antics are all unfunny, ""The Hangover Part III"" is not quite as bad as critics would lead you to believe; it has just lost the creativity and imagination that the original has.",1372464000,3,1521,4.689138576779026

5386692,4,B00A6UHBJM,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Four years have passed since audiences everywhere received The Hangover. An over-the-top comedy that followed three men as they tried to figure out exactly what happened the night before. Two years later we were given the sequel. A movie so similar to the first that many people didn't really see the point of its existence. Well now we have the third, and final, installment in The Hangover trilogy. While the previous sequel suffered from being too similar, this big finale is so different in its delivery that it almost feels like a completely different film. From the beginning Todd Philips stated that the third movie would be different, but I don't think I ever would have expected this.

Don't get me wrong, there's still a lot to love about The Hangover Part III. You still have Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Jade (Heather Graham) returns for a brief appearance, as does ""black"" Doug (Mike Epps), and we get to see an older Tyler aka ""Carlos"" (Grant Holmquist). The thing is, this third installment isn't inherently funny. There's the occasional funny moment scattered throughout the movie, but as a whole this finale aims to be more entertaining than it does to be funny. It took a much more serious approach and that's where it's going to lose a majority of its audience.

The story takes place two years after the second film. After causing a huge wreck on the freeway, Alan's father (Jeffrey Tambor) is so furious with him that he has a heart attack and dies. Alan's mother -- along with the Wolfpack, his maid, and a young boy from across the street -- decides to hold an intervention to inform Alan that he should go rehab because he's been off his ADHD medication. On the way there they get pulled over by a man named Marshall (John Goodman) who takes Doug (again!) until they can get him the money that Chow (Ken Jeong) stole from him.

There lies the biggest change to the original formula; there is no hangover. Now this wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the foundation for the series wasn't built on this pretty glaring omission. Instead of a movie built around yet another drug-induced hangover, we have one that's focused on Alan. The entire movie is more of a journey of him maturing in his own odd way. Between seeing ""his son"" Carlos and meeting Cassie (Melissa McCarthy), you see Alan realize that maybe his life isn't all that great and maybe he should start acting like an adult. In the end that's really what this movie's about and, now that I think about it, it seems fitting given the fact that Alan always seemed to be the one responsible for everything.

If you've seen the previous installments then you can expect more of the same as far as acting goes. Bradley Cooper still plays his calm, cool, collective character; Stu is still the first to freak out; and Alan is still a man child for a majority of the film. Honestly, even though none of these performances were new, I still enjoyed it. What always attracted me to these films in the first place was the characters, not the story. The three leads have always had a weird dynamic that always felt right within the context of the story. With that said, this was probably my least favorite performance from Jeong in this series, but they made up for it by including Goodman. Because, let's be honest, you can never go wrong with Goodman. Melissa McCarthy was a nice touch as Cassie and the young Holmquist gave a nice little performance as Tyler.

Overall Score: 7.25 - To be honest, I expected something more out of the big finale, but I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. As I said before, I enjoy this series because of its characters and it was nice to see the Wolfpack back together for one final film. Still, I wish they would have given Doug a bigger role this time around. If you've been a fan of this series then I would recommend you see it. Just don't go in expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy because that's not what this is and I don't think that's what Todd Phillips was going for.",1371686400,4,4086,4.598079561042524
5386693,3,B00A6UHBJM,"Synopsis:  Alan (Zach Galifinakis) decides to purchase a giraffe, but his recklessness inadvertently causes his father's heart attack and subsequent death.  Fed up with his immaturity and drug abuse, his family decides that he needs to go to intervention.  Alan agrees, but only as long as Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) take him to intervention in Phoenix, Arizona.  As the men are on their travels, they get sideswiped by Black Doug (Mike Epps) and crime boss Marshall (John Goodman).  Marshall abducts Doug for ransom in an effort to get back millions of dollars which were stolen from Marshall by Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), who has broken out of Thai prison since the end of Hangover 2.  The men are tasked with finding Chow and getting the money back, which sends them on a wild goose chase that sees them chasing Chow across the American Southwest and Mexico.  As the men chase Chow and attempt to get the money, they reconnect with some of the people they met previously, such as Jade (Heather Graham) and her growing son (who was an infant in the first Hangover movie.)  Will the men find Chow?  If so, will they maintain an allegiance to Marshall or help Chow along the way?  Will Doug get killed before the ransom is delivered?  What crazy antics will Chow get them into this time?  And will Alan ever grow up?!

This was the movie that Hangover 2 was meant to be:  A comedic action film that threw twists and turns along the way.  The reason that Hangover 2 was a flop was largely due to the fact that they tried to apply the action formula that was perfected in this movie to the exact same story (more or less) that was told during the first film.  Though the movie was critically panned, I laughed harder that this than I did Hangover 2 and found some moments to be as funny as the first.  Perhaps the reputation of the second movie made movie critics too cowardly to give this one better praises, but the reputation this one has is wholly unwarranted.  No it's not a classic, but it's certainly not a dud, either.  In the end, you have a very serviceable sequel that would be a slightly above-average film to watch even if you hadn't seen the other two.

I recommend this for fans of the other Hangover films, action movies, and comedies.",1371686400,16,2283,4.549019607843137
5386694,1,B00A6UHBJM,"""The Hangover Part III"" is such a joyless, unhappy excuse for a film, it almost defies description. Almost.

The key difference between ""III"" and the first two installments is that there is never a single moment in the film when the three characters played by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis seem happy to be together. In the first two films, there was at least the possibility of a good time at the bachelor party each film begins with. This moment helps illustrate their friendship and gives us a reason to go on these harrowing journeys with them. Yes, things go horribly wrong, but in the beginning, they are happy and excited. In ""III"", the reason for their trip is very different and they all seem to dread the very idea of the journey which doesn't help the film get off to a good start.

In ""III"", Alan (Galifianakis) has not been taking his meds leading to even more erratic behavior than in the previous films. When his actions lead to a pretty irresponsible, unsettling event, his family decides to have an intervention and Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) agree to drive Alan to a rehab facility in Arizona. On the way, Marshall (John Goodman), a gangster, has his men run the friends off the road. He takes Doug as a hostage and will return him if the other three find Chow (Ken Jeung), who has just escaped from a Thai prison. Chow stole $20 million in gold bars from the gangster and he wants it back. They hit the road and travel from Arizona to Tijuana before finally ending up back in Vegas. Along the way, they get into dangerous situations, people get hurt and killed, animals die, all in the pursuit of finding the gold and returning it. These situations aren't inherently funny and even the cast and crew seem to realize this because everything is played straight, leading to a bad impression of an action film.

Seriously, the only person who even seems to be attempting something funny is Galifianakis. He takes the man-child character he always plays to familiar places, places already explored with much more energy and vitality by John Candy, Jim Belushi, Chris Farley and others. This type of humor is, for me, best served in small doses. When the character and behavior are prevalent throughout the entire film, everything in the narrative seems dumb, just dumb, not smart-funny dumb. It is much harder to do smart-funny dumb, which is why we so seldom see it, and why so many comedies are completely forgettable.

Cooper and Helms grimace and frown their way through the entire film. And they have a right to, because they are in one dangerous situation after another. Hopefully, the large sequel-sized paycheck each received made up for this unpleasant experience. But what about our unpleasant experience? Who will pay us? We have to pay to sit and watch this dreck. That seems backward somehow.

I find it hard to believe that director Todd Phillips envisioned these films as a trilogy; when the first one made so much money, the plans for II and III were born. The phenomenal success of the first led to a virtual copycat set in a different country. Now, with the ""Epic Conclusion"", he changes the format of the film. Initially, this is a welcome idea - ""II"" was a hollow retread of the first film - but why make this film at all if you can't figure out a way to incorporate, in some way, the original idea? Basically, the only connection between the three films is the characters. Everything in this film happens moving forward, so the initial shock of seeing an outrageous moment and then learning about the circumstances leading up to it is gone. I suppose Alan killing a giraffe and the aftermath of this situation is meant to stand in for the bachelor party scene, but it is simply shocking and grimace-inducing. It just isn't funny.

Phillips is a mixed bag as a director. He's done some good films (""Old School"", ""The Hangover"") but most of his films are jaw-droppingly bad.

The road trip element of the story allows the narrative to return to Vegas and bring back some of the memorable characters from the first film; the boys visit Heather Graham's character at her new home. Her former hooker is now leading a respectable life with a new husband. The inclusion of this scene is just bizarre. It really isn't needed which leads to the question ""why is it included?"" To give all of Heather Graham's fans another look? Does she even have fans anymore? So the scene is not only unnecessary but boring.

How bad does a movie have to be when even Melissa McCarthy isn't funny? McCarthy pops up in a cameo. This is the first time I have not laughed at one of her cameos or performances. Her character is simply mean which is supposed to be a mirror image of Alan's treatment of others, but that doesn't work either. A mirror image of something that doesn't work is also something that doesn't work.

There are a number of incidents involving animals. In each, the animal is drugged, harmed or killed. Is this supposed to be funny? I think it is sort of sad. Everytime an animal pops up, something happens to them. In the other two films, animals make appearances and the level of harm played out on these creatures throughout the series seems gratuitous and out of proportion. Were the animals actually harmed during the filmmaking? No. But depicting these moments as `comedy' just seems wrong. Very wrong.

When the story finally gets to Vegas, the three men regard the opportunity to revisit the iconic city with palpable dread. They eventually learn that Chow is holed up in a penthouse at Caesar's Palace. Alan refers to the resort as a `hell-hole'. When they finally make it to the hotel, there is an extended sequence featuring acrobatics from the penthouse. My question is: Did Las Vegas and Caesar's Palace partner with the producers to make this film? Neither is painted in a very positive light. If you had your product featured in a film and someone referred to it as a `hell-hole' would you be happy? It might very well seem like an awful place to the characters, but none of this is remotely funny and seems like a stupid waste of time.

And on that note, I don't want to waste any more of our time on a movie that is essentially a complete waste of time.",1371254400,7,6240,4.632911392405063
5386695,3,B00A6UHBJM,"With the Hangover Part III, we are given the end of a trilogy that never needed to occur. The original film was a raunchy, off color story that left me laughing for the majority of its running time. This fresh comedy connected with audiences and became a breakout hit of 2009.

Of course, when a movie is successful, it naturally warrants a sequel. With the Hangover Part II, the filmmakers stuck to the basic formula of the first film. While there were still plenty of laughs, it failed to live up to the high standards of the first one. Despite this, it made enough money to warrant yet another sequel.

And so we arrive at the Hangover Part III. Although the original cast shows up to this movie, the story seems forced and the laughs are few and far in between. Most of the cast, and the filmmakers it seems, have phoned it in on this one. The movie becomes a kind of action thriller as the wolf pack sets out to find Chow.

There are a few redeeming moments to this movie. Zach Galifianakis gives it his all and becomes the character that provides the most genuine laughs. His scene with Melissa McCarthy, in particular, is probably my favorite part of the movie. Additionally, John Goodman is always reliable for a few laughs, and his turn here, as a drug leader desperate to find Chow, is no exception.

Overall, this film is more original than the formulaic Part II, but never finds the spark that ignited the original movie into a hit.",1371168000,8,1444,4.479087452471483
