4330136,2,B004CYF74E,Can no actor be articulate without  pre written dialogue?  This was painfully slow moving to watch.  I would like to revisit these actors now that the show has developed more threads.  Have they grown?  But this outing was just horrible waste of time.,1399766400,,251,4.744186046511628

4330138,5,B004CYF74E,"This was great to see everyone's personality.  You often wonder how they are in real life, and this was a great way to get into their normal ""being"".  Some were quite a change!  Each and every single Paley Center production is worth viewing.  You will love the people more after ""meeting them"" on Paley's programs.",1389139200,5,314,4.654545454545454
4330139,5,B004CYF74E,"Loved watching this and will definately rewatch it multiple times.

4330147,2,B004CYF74E,Maybe not a fair rating because we couldn't make it through more than 10 or 15 minutes of the program. We were so bored by the woman presenting the staff and cast. It was apparent she didn't know anything about the show either. It may have gotten better after where we stopped but we made it through only Shonda's first question. Not worth the time.,1446422400,,349,4.384615384615385
