7071344,5,B00UUOVPMS,"The Fisher King is one of my favorite films of all time and in my opinion is the best Terry Gilliam film. It has all of the magic, mastery and romance that the director never receives credit for in other pictures and still has a lot of complex themes that leaves each viewer discussing it long after it reaches the final frame. Gilliam has always been a gifted artist, he pulls all of these sensibilities off to the highest level and effect that makes him a one of a kind director. After The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen (1988), which was an amazing film but suffered a lot of problems during production, it seemed he would never work again but after reading Richard LaGravenese's beautifully written script, it inspired and even challenged him to try new things. For the first time he was directing a script that he did not write himself, something he vowed never to do in the past, and he had the opportunity to do an astonishing fairy tale but one that was more grounded in reality. Even though he did change the grand central station scene in one aspect, he did not want to get in the way of the script that LaGravenese had written and yet was still able to add his own unique vision to the design of the film, particularly the Red Knight that haunts Parry (beautifully portrayed by Robin Williams). Jeff Bridges is at the top of his game here as well I think, even considering it his best performance.

The DVD extras are well produced and put together and well worth the price, maybe beyond so. The 2 part documentary on the making of the film that features new interviews with Gilliam, Bridges, LaGravenese and others is my favorite. I found all of the stories and thoughts that everyone shared were just as inspiring and moving as the film itself, all of whom have touching things to say about the late Robin Williams that it moved me to tears. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is an admirer of the film. You won't regret it. I didn't.",1436572800,8,1954,4.473389355742297
7071345,5,B00UUOVPMS,"The Criterion Collection comes through again with a superb transfer supervised by director Terry Gilliam. There is an excellent amount of detail and no signs of debris and defects. The colors all look excellent and I daresay The Fisher King hasn't looked this good since it first debuted in theaters.

There is an audio commentary by Gilliam that originally appeared on Criterions 1991 laserdisc. He starts off stating the three rules that governed his filmmaking and that he broke them all on this film. He eloquently analyzes the prevailing themes of the film while also recounting anecdotes about making it in his trademark engaging fashion. He also talks about the role New York City played in the film and the challenge of shooting on location. This is a must-listen for Gilliam fans and admirers of The Fisher King.

There are six deleted scenes with optional commentary by Gilliam. They are interesting for completists but it is obvious why they were cut.

The Tale of The Fisher King consists of two short documentaries featuring new interviews with Gilliam, producer Lynda Obst, screenwriter Richard LaGravenese and actors Jeff Bridges, Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer. They take us through the origins of the project, including how they all got involved. LaGravenese says that the script was a reaction to the harsh materialism of the 80s. Ruehl had studied the Fisher King myth and was very familiar with it. Plummer knew nothing about the myth but was really drawn to the character of Lydia. This is an excellent, substantial look back at how The Fisher King came together.

The Tale of the Red Knight features artists Keith Greco and Vincent Jefferds looking back at the challenges they faced creating Parrys nemesis the Red Knight using practical effects. They actually dig through the surviving props and talk about the materials they used to achieve what Gilliam wanted.

Jeffs Tale features Bridges taking us through behind-the-scenes photographs he took while making the film. He recalls anecdotes behind many of the photos in this engaging extra.

Jeff and Jack features behind-the-scenes footage of Bridges rehearsing his shock jock material. The actor takes us through how he prepared for it, including some of the things he did. This extra provides fascinating insight into the prep work involved.

Robins Tale is a 2006 interview with Robin Williams as he recalls working on The Fisher King. Not surprisingly, he speaks highly of collaborating with Gilliam and what he loved about the mans work. He recounts some of his favorite moments working on the film, including being naked in Central Park at night.

Costume Tests features footage of the four main actors trying on various outfits for their respective characters.

Finally, there is a collection five trailers for the film.",1435622400,10,2805,5.093681917211329
7071346,5,B00UUOVPMS,"With the death of Robin Williams much of his previous work will be re-examined in ways that don't necessarily compliment those new works. Often times people scour an older work for clues as to an performers personality that, in a sense, alters the work.

""The Fisher King"" deserves a new examination on the merit of the quality of the film not the events that occurred years after it was made. Featuring three terrific performances from Jeff Bridges, Williams and Mercedes Ruehl (who deservedly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar although both Williams and Bridges were overlooked), Terry Gilliam's film was a rarity at the time--a film he hadn't written that he had chosen to direct (something Gilliam swore he would never do up to that point).

Richard LaGravenese's well written script (his first produced) changed Gilliam's mind. A script at turns funny, exciting and tragic, ""The Fisher King"" provided Gilliam the perfect Terry Gilliam script that he didn't write (and it's unlikely that the ending for the film would have come from Gilliam although it works perfectly for the film). Great performances spring from great scripts and great direction and there isn't a false note in ""The Fisher King"".

SPOILERS:

Bridges plays Jack a radio shock jock who's choices impact both his life and that of a history professor named Parry(Williams). Their link doesn't appear until years later when Jack meets the now homeless and mentally disturbed Parry. Jack decides to help Parry hoping that will atone for the mistake he made years before that inadvertantly contributed to Parry's downfall. Parry believes he is now on a quest for the Holy Grail so that he can win over the woman he loves from afar (Amanda Plummer) and Jack is determined to help turn Parry's life around. Standing between them and their goal are visions of The Red Knight with his flaming sword and a millionaire's penthouse that may house the Holy Grail that will provide redemption for both.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray from Criterion looks top notch with a brand new 4k restoration and transfer supervised by Gilliam. This new transfer is a marginal improvement over the Image release on Blu-ray that has been demanding big bucks. The audio here sounds terrific with a lossless 5.1 soundtrack that serves the film well. What separates this edition from the previous one are the special features.

""The Tale of The Fisher King"" provides us with two excellent 30 minute documentaries on the making of the film covering everything from the production choices of Gilliam to the look of the film.

""The Tale of The Red Knight"" is also new to this set and focuses on the creation of this iconic figure for the film.

""Jeff's Tale"" runs just over 23 minutes and allows Bridges to discuss shooting the film along with behind-the-scenes photos he took of the production.

""Jeff and Jack"" focuses on Bridges' prepartion for the role of Jack and his work with his acting coach Stephen Bridgewater to help prepare him for the role.

""Robin's Tale"" brings us an older interview with Williams where he discusses his prepartion for the role and thoughts on the film.

Terry Gilliam's 1991 interview is ported over from the laserdisc edition of the film. It would have been nice to get Bridges to sit down with his director for a new commentary but this is still pretty comprehensive.

We also get five trailers (both domestic and international) as well as six deleted scenes that runs about 13 minutes.

The booklet that we normally get is a fold out poster with Bridges and Williams from the film along with an essay on the back. I would have preferred a booklet as it would be a bit easier to read.

Although the second act of ""The Fisher King"" could be a bit tighter, ""The Fisher King"" remains one of Gilliam's best and most focused works.

The Blu-ray is a nice step up over the previous edition from Image and improves on the previous DVD as well. Arrow is also releasing this as I recall (but it is a region ""B"" Blu-ray) with some different special features. Fans with a region free player may want to see what the special features are before decided on this edition or the Arrow. This is an exceptionally good release from Criterion.

Highly recommended.",1435622400,17,4221,4.808011049723757
7071347,5,B00UUOVPMS,This movie brings attention to an ongoing problem of homelessness and how the mentally ill are treated by society. I think that this was one of Robin Williams best movie performances. This is a Terry Gilliam masterpiece. Jeff Bridges performance was remarkable. I highly recommend this movie.,1435536000,3,292,5.23404255319149
7071348,4,B00UUOVPMS,"The Fisher King,"" directed by Terry Gilliam, focuses on cynical disc jockey Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges), whose signature style is making fun of the frustrations and misery of his callers. When one of his rants against the yuppies who frequent a particular bar leads to a frequent caller going to the bar and opening fire, randomly killing several patrons, Jacks life takes a dark turn into emotional despair. He abandons radio for a life as a recluse and appears disconnected from humanity. At this point, he meets a eccentric homeless man (Robin Williams), whos lost his mind after experiencing a personal tragedy.

Though both Bridges and Williams turn in outstanding performances, it is Williams who shines brighter. The role lends itself to flamboyance and excessive exaggeration, two of Williams strong points. Apart form a showcase portrayal, however, Williams inhabits the character and digs deep to expose the hurt and torture that has spiraled him down a bleak, sad path.

Director Gilliam draws a fantasy element into the earthbound story of Jacks guilt at feeling responsible for inspiring an act of mass murder. The director taps heavily into Williams ability to create humor and prevents the picture from being overly cerebral. We respond to Williams first, his character second. Through his performance, he makes an oddball character accessible and sympathetic.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary by Terry Gilliam; new interviews with Gilliam, the producer, screenwriter and actors Jeff Bridges, Amanda Plummer and Mercedes Ruehl; 2006 interview with Robin Williams; video essay featuring Bridges on-set photographs; deleted scenes; costume tests; critical essay; and 1991 footage of Bridges training as a radio personality.",1434844800,12,1765,5.434306569343065

8708370,3,B00UUOVPMS,"Usually Criterion knocks it out of the park with their presentations, but this blu-ray edition of the Fisher King is a disappointment. I didn't think the high definition transfer was that great,  The picture was often grainy and somewhat murky. But the biggest disappointment was the sound.

I had to constantly adjust the sound throughout the entire movie. The dialogue was often low and muffled while the loud parts were booming. It was hard to enjoy this wonderful film while having to constantly adjust the sound up and down

I'm surprised that this ""director approved"" Criterion blu-ray ever got approved by the director.  I recently purchased the Criterion film Moonrise and it was beautifully done. All I can say is the Fisher King deserves better.",1532390400,,755,5.016

8708375,2,B00UUOVPMS,Should have won all the academy awards in my opinion.  Blue Ray transfer was not a good one though.  Way too much grain in the image.
