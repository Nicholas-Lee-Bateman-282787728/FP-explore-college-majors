5892287,5,B00E688AZE,can hardly wait for Christmas hubby love the series- My husband is a huge fan and will love being able to view the series whenever he wants to cant wait for Santa to  stuff his stocking.,1384646400,3,186,4.166666666666667
5892288,3,B00E688AZE,Would have given 5 stars if Peackeeper Wars would have been included..this show is really good-- it has something for everyone and is very entertaining...This show was taken before its time and deserves to come back Really!!,1384387200,7,224,5.081081081081081
5892289,5,B00E688AZE,"I love this show. Farscape is a big mix of a lot of the things a science fiction fan like me love to see. You get the visceral stuff like cool sets and special effects that move from neat to full on spectacle. You get the science stuff like explanations and effects of alien physiology and various advanced and imaginative technologies. You get the story driven stuff with scripts going from drama to action to comedy (sometimes all in one episode), dealing with complexities of alien cultures and governments, to straight up space opera type fair complete with villains in black and scary monsters to fight. There is a reason why Farscape was considered by critics and viewers alike to be one of the best science fiction television shows ever made.

You have a modern day Earthling astronaut who is the main character in the series. His is a fish out of water kind of story as he is thrust into this alien part of the galaxy by a wormhole with absolutely no clue regarding his new surroundings. This isn't your normal fish out of water character. This is an intelligent, wise cracking fish who not only takes his new challenges with relative stride, but also with a note of sarcasm. The supporting cast is just as interesting... and interestingly enough all escaped convicts. There is the human female looking plant organism of mediation and empathy (convicted of murder). There is the aggressive tentacle-headed alien with a warrior's rage (also convicted of murder, but is innocent). A blue pixie-like skinned party girl who plays thief and spy at times (convicted of non-conformity). A froggish-like alien with a superiority complex (imprisoned after a coup against him). And last, but certainly not least the tough as nails female Peacekeeper soldier who is a strictly by the book type (ironically on the run for being socially exposed to said convicts). The cast changes a bit later on, but this is pretty much the core group and shows a taste of the interesting developments based on characters alone.

The series has varying story arcs much like what you have seen on Deep Space Nine, Babylon 5 and other such shows. What seems to be the main premise of the show slowly morphs into something else. This is done in a way flows smooth and feels organic. What surprises they do pop up on you make sense and aren't just to shake things up. Most episodes have a good mix of the things I mentioned earlier, but sometimes they go off on tangents. Especially on the third season. One example is an episode done entirely animated and ran like an old Warner Brothers cartoon. Even in the odd episodes the show is pretty good.

So good characters and good stories are nice, but science fiction for many lives of dies by the visuals. This is where Farscape shines. Sets are intricate and the CGI scenes are dynamic. Special effects can be found all over the place from laser blasts to animatronics to computer generated space battles. As a matter of fact Farscape has the distinction of being the television series with more special effects on average per episode than any other science fiction show to date. So you want flash and style in your substance? We got you covered.

I think it's fair to warn you the series ended on a cliffhanger, but was finally concluded with the made for TV movie The Peacekeeper Wars (which creator Brian Henson refers to as episodes 4:23-4:26). Sadly you will have to get this separately on DVD (there is an import Blu-Ray out there too).

Aside from two minor details the 15th Anniversary Edition is essentially a re-release of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-The-Complete-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B005CXOG8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape: The Complete Series [Blu-ray</a>] repackaged in a more minimalistic cover (first detail change... cool look though). Like the previous release you won't get 1080p high definition. Technically it can be called high definition because it's going to be more than 480p in resolution. However not by much. You see the original 35mm film used to film the episodes are pretty much lost so there is no remastering of the source material. Even if they had the original film the CG effects weren't done on that resolution so remastering would have been difficult. Best they can do is use the European PAL video master tapes, which should be at 576p resolution. While this isn't truly high definition it is the best these shows have ever looked, and the end result even has Brian Henson's approval on it.

This Blu-Ray set will have 20 disks covering all 88 episodes (minus the mini-series of course) plus all of the extras from the previous Blu-Ray release (including the extras from the Starburst Edition DVDs). Here is a breakdown:

Peacekeeper Wars Collectible Comic - This is the second thing different from the previous release. It is a 16 page comic written and drawn by award winning Ramon Perez. It's called Backyard Barbecue and it takes place at the same time of the Peacekeeper Wars (the mini series that Lionsgate still refuses to allow to be added to the collection). At 16 pages it's going to be short though. The comic will also include an interview with creator Brian Henson and some images from the Henson Archive. No idea if the interview and images are going to squeeze away at those 16 pages or are considered an addition to.

Episode Commentaries - The packaging says 35 commentaries covering the spectrum of all the major cast and crew throughout, however it seems you are still only getting the same 31 commentaries found in the 2011 Blu-Ray. These are the original commentaries from the DVD collections.

Memories of Moya: An Epic Journey Explored - New documentary exclusive to the Blu-Ray releases chronicling retrospective interviews from cast and crew.

Farscape Undressed - This was a one hour behind the scenes feature shown on the Sci-Fi Channel to help prime new viewers for the third season. This feature wasn't released on the Starburst or DVD sets before it (it is in the new DVD series collection though) and was big in demand back in the day.

In the Beginning: A Look Back with Brian Henson - A very informative interview with Brian Henson that was made in 2004. It runs about a half and hour and was on the Starburst release and up.

Making of a Space Opera - A 22 minute documentary on the making of the series. Not quite as informative as Brian's interview, but makes a good promotional piece for the series.

Season 3: A Look Back with Executive Producer David Kemper - Basically David's take on season three and how the show has matured so far.

Farscape: The Story So Far - This is a 22 minute catch up feature for people to get familiar with Farscape up to the fourth season. This featurette was in previous collections.

Inside Farscape: Villains - 15 minutes of interviews with the actors who make up the major villains Scorpius (Wayne Pygram), Crais (Lani Tupu), and Commandant Grayza (Rebecca Riggs). Cool to see Wayne out of makeup.

Inside Farscape: Special Effects - Animal Logic was the visual effects company that worked on Farscape. This feature shows before and after images of various effect pieces along with a commentary explaining what you see.

Inside Farscape: Save Farscape - Pretty inspiring piece on the efforts by fans and crew to revive the show enough for it get a proper send off.

Deleted Scenes - There have been 90 minutes of deleted scenes previously released, and we are getting them all.

Farscape in the Raw: Director's Cut Scenes - Compares the final scenes with the director's print. Keep in mind these scenes are without special effects, music, or sometimes even proper dubbing.

Alternate Version of the Season 2 Premiere

Listening In with Composer Guy Gross - Focuses on Guy and the process he goes through composing the music for the series. You get to watch him at work pretty much while he gives a commentary on what he does.

Behind the Scenes Interviews - I am thinking this may be the interviews from the previous collections from actors Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Gigi Edgley and Wayne Pygram.

Zhaan Forever - A more in depth interview with Virginia Hey. Runs about ten minutes.

On the Last Day: Wrap Speech from David Kemper - A goodbye speech from David to the crew. Recommended viewing once you finish watching the series.

Production and Design Galleries - archival photo galleries, character concepts, promo photos, design gallery screen shots, rough drafts, and concept slide shows.

Original TV promos and trailers

Farscape is a sci-fi TV series that ranks right up there with the best of them. Every fan of the genre should get familiar with this show. This release has little to add to the table since the previous 2011 Blu-Ray. So if you bought the original you can breath happy unless you really need that comic. Although it seems at least at the time of this review be cheaper than the 2011 Blu-Ray, and you get the new cover art, a tiny bit more content and the 15th Anniversary moniker.

Or at least some new interviews, behind-the-scenes, making-of, bloopers?
Otherwise this new 15-year anniversary edition turns out to be just a reissue of the 1st edition (2011) blu-ray set.

Unfortunately this 2nd edition doesn't seem to include the Peacekeeper Wars miniseries either. ;-(

BTW...
Peacekeeper Wars (the mediocre Euro Video German edition with DD 5.1 English audio) is not the only one anymore [currently out of stock, though].

5892295,2,B00E688AZE,"Farscape is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of A&E with AVC encoded 1080p transfers in 1.33:1 for the series' first three seasons and 1.78:1 for the last season (I""ve included screencaps of both aspect ratios so that you can see the difference). Farscape was filmed in Australia and presented there in the PAL standard. The series' creators are insisting that the 35mm prints are nowhere to be found, plus the visual effects were created in SD (meaning they'd have to be recreated for a true HD master), so this is an upconversion which unfortunately does not look great a lot of the time. I'd actually rank the 1.33:1 seasons at somewhere between a 2.5 and 3.0 and the fourth season moderately higher at between a 3.0 and 3.5, for an average score of 3.0. The image is frequently fuzzy, with less than appealing color and some very spotty contrast. The series is often quite dark, regularly taking place within Moya's labyrinthine confines, and crush is rampant throughout these sequences. Things have at least a moderate improvement in the final season of the series, though even at a wider aspect ratio, the image is still distressingly soft a lot of the time, with little of the pop that one would hope for with a series of this relatively recent vintage and one which boasts such an impressive production design and sometimes staggering visual effects. In fact it's the visual effects that probably come off best in the series, with the animated sequences of Moya or other interstellar sequences achieving a modicum of clarity and precision which the rest of this presentation lacks.",1376611200,,1586,4.877777777777778

5892299,5,B00E688AZE,"This review is for the Farscape series in general, not this specific release. Since there isn't much new on this release from the previous edition, I'm just going to talk about the show.

So... you like Guardians of the Galaxy, but wish there was a lot more? Then may I recommend Farscape?

Made by the Jim Henson company, this show ran for 4 seasons on the SciFi network, and was followed up with a mini series to tie up loose plotlines. You'll find several familiar characters.

John Crichton is an astronaut who got pulled into a wormhole into the far side of the galaxy. None of the other characters take him very seriously because he makes a lot of pop cultural references none of them understand. Sounds a bit like Peter Quill / Star Lord. He also develops a powerful ability no one else understands. Both of them also wear long trenchcoats and use twin pistols.

Officer Aeryn Sun is an alien who looks human - raised from birth to be a soldier. She and Crichton have a will they / won't they unresolved sexual tension thing going on. Gammora, anyone? Bonus - she's also hated by her former comrades (Nebula).

Ka D'Argo is a warrior who is pushes others away because of his violent past. His wife and child were killed and he seeks revenge. Drax, perhaps?

Rigel the XVI is the deposed ruler of an alien race who is insulting, greedy, and a thief. Granted, he's not furry or the product of science experiments, but he's small in size and has a lot in common with Rocket.

Zhaan is a plant based being who is the most spiritual of the group, but also can be surprisingly violent. She can say a lot more than ""I am Groot,"" but still...also, she's blue and bald like Nebula.

Oh, and they're all escaped criminals being hunted by an insane military commander. Two of them in fact - the first, Crais, starts out like Ronan, but ends up becoming an ally like Yondu. The second, Scorpius, is pure manipulative evil with his own agenda - much like Thanos.

There's no really good match for some of the other characters like Chiana or Pilot, but if you want to see a show with the same humor, drama, and action as Guardians of the Galaxy, I highly recommend Farscape. It is easily in my top 5 scifi shows of all time.",1511395200,,2217,4.427518427518428

So your blueray menus will be fullscreen..but your episodes have huge black bars on each side.

I tried streching/zoom..but the picture quality turns to you-know-what...and isn't worth it.

(First Photo Upload) The episode ""Mental as Anything"" has an editing screen number in the first frame of a sequence where John Crichton is trying to get a ""key"" from hot rocks. Either the number should be removed or that frame should be.

(Other Uploads) ""Farscape: The Archives"" Digital Video Disc lists ""PSYCHOTICALLY AMBITIOUS: A FARSCAPE REUNION"" among the contents. The screen menus do not. This feature is not here!

Other than those small gems, and the first several seasons being full frame, instead of widescreen, this is a television series you would want to see in order. If you miss an episode (I avoided the ship eating episode when it aired) you may be slightly lost as to what happened to who, or who certain characters are. The Moya Crew do tend to reference themselves almost as much as pop culture. It is great to have the entire series so I can now follow along without too many questions. There are some continuity issues but very minor... Some of the Sci-fi commercials were not the highest quality either, but these are bonus features.

Being an Anniversary Edition, you would think they would have ironed out all these small flaws!

So i grew up with this show and i loved it. Ill be the first to admit its not every ones cup of tea. That being said i feel that what set this show apart from others was its details. More specifically the sets, props and  the aliens(puppet or otherwise). now as far as effects the in cgi the were quality for the time it was filmed. Personally i like puppets over cgi any day of the week the add substance and a realistic feel to the series.

As far as plot goes i love how the mc is having to fight a daily struggle to understand and fit in in a new world where every thing is alien while at the same time you can feel the strain it is putting on his psyche. You can see the cracks forming in his sanity and how it is even called in to question in the final season with speculation on ptsd. It adds a real feeling to what in other words would be and over the top scifi Pocahontas story in space.

As far aspic quality  goes its blueray quality with a few instances where the grain slips to something closer to dvd. But it is a series shot when hid-eff was and its infancy and is a problem shared with all digital remasters.

Complaining about aspect ratio for a series that was shot when most televisions weren't widescreen is a wast of breath.

packaging is complete with the TV SERIES in its entirety. Ive never seen any other series sold as a complete collection with movies included go buy the peacekeeper wars MOVIE separate like and other fan would have to do for another series they enjoyed.

The bonus feature are deleted seasons, voice over commentator presentations by different star actors and creators, and a special previous season recap presentation that was aired between seasons just before season premier.",1463270400,2,1964,4.3911845730027546

It follows the story of an astronaut thrown into an alien galaxy, filled with some of the most well developed and interesting characters ever put to the small screen. For many years, and even arguably to this day, this was the best show ever released on the Science Fiction channel. In my opinion, only the Battlestar Gallactica remake has surpassed it.

The love, pride and passion of the cast, crew, writers and directors shine through with each episode and only get stronger as the series gets further along. Many plot twists, emotional ups and downs carry viewers forward to a finish that while lacking in this box set is completed in the Peacekeeper Wars movie-length conclusion.

5892428,5,B00E688AZE,"Farscape is what I always thought Lost In Space should have been because it is wildly imaginative and filled with unique looking and acting aliens who have agendas that are mysterious to the space oddity, John Crichton. If you look past the fact there are 'muppets' and yes I realize that is a hard pill for many of you so-called *ahem* ADULTS to swallow, you will notice the story lines are not geared for six year olds but are written for adults who are entertained by interjecting high fantasy into their space opera. Seriously is there any reason WHY good science fiction that takes place in space must mimic either Star Trek or Star Wars? Henson has injected a large element of fantasy into his sci-fi and given it a much needed boost from the dreary and drab formulaic movies and shows that pepper Hollywood in the past thirty years. In fact, the muppets allow a variance of that same fantasy and giving other actors a chance to display skills and talents that do not always require sitting in the makeup chair for hours. Puppeteers and voice actors get a chance to shine and show they too can add mood and flavor to characters.

After having watched this series through from beginning to end twice in a row, I have to say I love this series. When it was first out I was biased like a lot of clods who dismissed it due to the puppetry aspects. Now that I'm older and retired, I have more time to devote to enjoying my favorite shows and this has become one of them. Here's a show that is definitely NOT for kids because they kill off main characters in the series which is something you do NOT do for a children's TV series. It's hard to choose a beloved character but I've become enamored of the Hynerian Rygel who when overly excited expels helium from his bowels and while amusing to hear he and his shipmates speak with a high pitched voices for a few seconds, it clearly aggravates them. There are a couple of times you learn about Rygel's past and what transpired to cause him to be who he is today as well as the few times he gets to step in an negotiate terms of safe passage or blackmail the bad guys.

The show is a blast, folks. Does it matter that it is no longer on the air? No. Star Trek is no longer on the air and yet it still has a huge following. Farscape is a terrific show with plenty of action, suspense, thrills, laughs and yeah they do swear quite a bit on the show. Dren = s**t and Frell = F**k  which are two words they tend to use quite a bit and are brilliant to get around the censors. Not unlike BSG who used Frack in the same manner but they didn't have dren. Like so many who loved this show, I was honked off to learn that it got booted in favor of that idiotic reality show 'Scare Tactics' which was a lame ripoff of Candid Camera with low brow horror and terrible acting thrown in but reality shows are easy to put out for a few pennies in comparison and a great show like Farscape requires massive special effects, makeup, sound stages, costumes, and so on just to keep their doors open.

I'm hoping that Rockne O'Bannon and the Jim Henson company can come together and perhaps put together a continuing Farscape perhaps like ST did with other avenues. If not, then perhaps their fertile minds can come up with other nifty sci-fi shows? If they can dream up Farscape, why not something else as wild and imaginative? We need it because television today sucks.",1452988800,,3399,4.356466876971608

5892438,5,B00E688AZE,"Farscape is a FRELLING great action-adventure science fiction television show.

Why?

Maybe its just because Peacekeeper Chicks are the dradest. Especially the ones with Australian accents.

Or it could be that Crichton, even though he is absolutely frakking fahrbot, is also REPRESENTING with that ALL AMERICAN Southern Boy football jock charm, flying the Stars and Stripes proudly in intergalactic space and upholding our Second Amendment rights no matter how many Scarrans, Sebaceans, and Budongs stand in the way.

Or maybe its the entire gestalt - This Australian-American joint venture is simply  THE GOOD DREN.

I also purchased the FPW movie that ties it all up. You need to appreciate originality and uniqueness to enjoy this science fiction series. If you liked Firefly you will most likely enjoy this. Also, for those of you who watched Stargate, you have seen two of the lead characters from Farscape. In fact, when they introduced the character of Vala, there was an inside joke made for us who already knew who they were and that they had been together in Farscape. Some of the story line is a little dark, but most science fiction deals with the battle of good against evil. That's just the way it is. Also, Jim Henson, genius.",1444694400,7,766,4.326388888888889

5892457,5,B00E688AZE,"Fun and goofy, well written and dren... All await you should you wish to guide your tv thru this particular wormhole. Wacky costumes, some well executed and some were, well silly. Bad guys? Scorpius is a villain of epic proportions, brought low by Commandant Cleavage, Crais was just a sap and we named our dog Chiana in honor of the gray/blue Nebari we fell in love with. Lots of extras kept the show moving, the sets were cheezee (sometimes) but for a weekly series I thought they did a good job.
I watched the series when it came out, every week I recorded it on VHS and when I was divorced the tapes went with the ex... Then I saw that the show was doing reruns, the dvd discs advertised and here I am on Amazon, writing a review. I would call myself a forgiving, fanatic fan that loves the series in spite of the 'gaps'. It has a 'Star Trek' meets 'Alice in Wonderland' on mushrooms kinda feel to it. Lots of blasting, yelling shut up, starbursting away and 'we can't starburst' moments, fun times and sad. An enduring love story between Creighton and Aeryn, jilted/cuckold and unexpressed love/lust everywhere, dialog that made me laugh and groan. There were also twists that would defy a Terrelian to untangle and always the info locked in John's head, wormhole technology. Everybody wants it and to protect that info, the beings that put it there (the Ancients) have encode it and tucked it into John's subconscious.
I love the series, warts and all. If you like space drama, aliens, love stories, good bad guys and bad good guys, having your imagination stretched and your brain warped, this might be just the show for you.",1440460800,2,1632,4.592465753424658

3# pedestrian and predictable scripts
4# weak special effects

5892476,4,B00E688AZE,"This review is for the Farscape Complete Series 15th Anniversary Collection BluRay edition.

I'm not going to spend a lot of time analyzing black levels and color saturation and sound quality.  That's been done in other places.

What I am going to say is: If you are an owner of the Starburst Edition DVD set and are bothered by the jaggy lines that are very apparent, especially in scenes with movement then you need to update to the this BluRay set. Those lines are gone.

The other plus is that the BluRay set takes up 4 discs of space on the shelf instead of the 12+ discs that the Starburst edition was using.

Four stars because it's still not really HD (which is sad) and because it's apparently a transfer from the tapes used for broadcast there's a ""Dolby"" logo at the beginning of the episodes.

I'm still happy with the purchase because of the massive improvement in picture quality over the old DVD and I got it for a great price.",1432857600,12,942,4.4476744186046515

This show premiered over 15 years ago, and the stories still hold up as if they just aired in my opinion!  Lots of extra features on the collection overall.

It took me two sets of discs to construct a single set that was undamaged and playable.

5892496,5,B00E688AZE,"I was flipping through channels recently and landed smack in the middle of an episode of ""Farscape"".  I had NO idea what was going on,and had never seen the show before, but the gist of the story and the depth of the characters instantly drew me in.  I purchased the box set, and I am so glad I did! This is one of the most creative, crazy, addicting Science Fiction shows ever made, and many of the CGI sequences have held up remarkably well.

But it's not the explosions, prosthetic alien makeup, or detailed sets and puppets (Yes, I said puppets, but these ain't your friendly Fraggles) that drive ""Farscape""; it is the development and interactions between all the intriguing characters that will hook you.  At the crux of the tale is John Crichton, an astronaut who  accidentally arrives in a distant region of space after traversing a wormhole.  He immediately encounters a ship, a living ship (Think giant space whale) full of prisoners making their escape from a militaristic force called the Peacekeepers.  And the space odyssey begins in earnest!  Crichton works to simultaneously become accepted and useful to the outcast crew, and his ultimate goal of returning to Earth.

The characters in ""Farscape"" are not your typical sterile, static Sci-fi batch viewers are use to. They are a flawed, self-serving and pretty violent little band of misfits...but they each have redeeming qualities, and the more you watch them, the more you love them.  Each actor takes every opportunity to explore their character's facets, and they do a terrific job. The show is able to be dark and gritty, yet transition to comedic scenes seamlessly. And you really do forget the puppets are puppets. Trust me.

Another aspect of ""Farscape"" that MUST be mentioned is the romance between Crichton and Aeryn, a former Peacekeeper also stranded about the ship with the prisoners.  The relationship that builds between them is so deliciously complicated that I couldn't look away from any of their scenes together, afraid I'd miss some nuance or long look.  Seriously torturous! But the kind of torture you sorta like.  Ben Browder and Claudia Black have some serious chemistry, and it soooo drove many a ""Farscape"" story. They made me cry!  Like, multiple times.  Again, an unusual feat for traditional Science Fiction.

It is a shame that a show this cool was cancelled before its time. I think the writers and actors would've done justice to a 5th season.  There are many extras and commentaries that are worth a listen, as are the bloopers.  Lastly, if you get this box set and you are a new fan like me, go ahead and get the mini-series ""The Peacekeeper Wars."" Buy it before you finish the last episode of Season 4, or you're frelled, my friend.",1424563200,3,2733,4.82618025751073

5892542,5,B00E688AZE,"Okay, so I;ve been watching the series on netflix and just had to get it because there's 2 working tvs and only one with netflix. I haven't watched it so I'm not sure of the quality of the dvds I purchased (they came in what appeared to be the unopened original box bos I have high hopes), but this is a great series. Its somehow one of those Sci-Fi shows that didn't get a huge following despite being oon air for 5 season, plus the movie which concluded the series, ""The Peacekeeper Wars"", it's great!
So the plot is you get this 20th century astronaut who's also a scientist/engineer and through a spectacular accident, shove him through a wormhole on the other side of the galaxy in the middle of a firefight where he loks exaclty like the bad guys (thats right, the aliens who look human are eveil and the ones who look alien are good), the first human-like person he meets Aeryn (she's Sebacian actually) is like this bad-ass bounty hunter/commando who wipes him n the floor. So he spends the series on this living ship called Moya, trying to find his way home, learning about the species and customs of the galaxy, learning about wormholes, growing as a person, falling in love. There's a bit of everything-skin tight leather, fighting, explosions, steaming kisses. You can't go wrong with this series.",1416787200,5,1309,4.622317596566524

5892559,1,B00E688AZE,"I'm giving this a 1-star review to get your attention. It's actually worth 2 stars.

I first thought this was a 5-star series, but at a certain point the original good story line ran out and the whole thing flopped, reduced to a kind of Jean-Luc Picardie series of weird, disjointed, personal, meaningless, Twilight Zonie escapes.

I got tired of the ""sex,"" Scorpius, the ugly aliens, the hasty-looking ""plots"", the overwhelmingly loud and distorting sound track, the aimless wandering, the BS about the ship ""Moya,""---and just all of it.

Terrible acting except for Rygel (a puppet) and D'Ardo, who apparently never worked again.

Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy over-rated; almost nothing Original. It seemed like silly retreads of old sci-fi.

The way it treated Scorpius made him boring, annoying, and repulsive---like having Darth Vader chew gum and wear Nike sneakers. Horrible, pointless, maybe eveen drugged or drunken destruction of of an at-first interesting character.",1412380800,3,964,5.4

5892563,5,B00E688AZE,"I am a late-comer to this series, having discovered it on Netflix. It turns out that, when taken with the Peacekeeper Wars, it has just about the most perfect arcs for the characters and relationships as any show I've ever watched. The best part is, while there is a central romance in the story, it is not the entire story. There is a wonderful focus on friendships and family relationships that you don't always see in shows. I have frequently been let down when shows neglect the ""secondary"" characters and relationships, but Farscape doesn't fall into that trap. I also love that the characters are all shades of grey, even if most are quite so literal as Chiana. The performances are wonderful and all of the actors are given multiple opportunities to shine.

The box set is nicely packaged with extras. I do wish there were more commentaries for the later seasons, but some of that is simply fangirl greed. One of my favorites is the commentary on what the cast and crew acknowledges as an episode that just doesn't work. (I won't name it, to avoid spoiling it for anyone thinking of purchasing the box.)

Definitely worth the time to listen to the commentaries. Be sure that you purchase the Peacekeeper Wars (only on DVD), which are not included in the box, or you will not have the final chapter of the TV adventures.",1411516800,,1326,4.638297872340425

The thing I'll say about Farscape is that the story arc is incredible, the acting is top-notch, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. The characters' development over the seasons makes it worth it all to me. Although they're constantly on the run and facing problem after problem, the journey you go on with them is true, sci-fi at it's best. Bad guys become good guys and make you question the meaning of character and ""good"" vs. ""evil.""  Major characters you fall in love with, inevitably, can get killed because life in the ""Uncharted Territories"" is messy, and not safe.

5892593,3,B00E688AZE,"The video on the Blu-Ray version is pretty good considering it is upconverted from the PAL tapes. As noted elsewhere, since PAL has more vertical lines (576) than NTSC (480), this is still an improvement from the NTSC DVD. Furthermore there is no sign at all of any interlacing, which the NTSC DVD is almost certain to have. The Blu-Ray is fully progressive scan, as you would expect, and I can find no sign of deinterlacing artifacts, so either the source tapes were themselves progressive PAL, or a very good deinterlacing algorithm has bee used. The colours are vibrant and there is no sign of video compression artifacts.

The audio on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. There is a very distracting and artificial echo/reverberation in a lot the dialogue. It comes and goes, but is present to some degree in every episode I've watched so far (most of season 1). I thought it might be some cheesy surround effect, but I examined each channel separately and found that it is present even when listening to the centre channel alone. I'm really not sure how the blu-ray.com review missed this.

There are also significant sync issues between the video and the dialogue, but as this comes and goes with nearby cuts, it is likely just a defect in the original production. It makes me wonder if the echo might be of similar origin.

Finally, though the Blu-Ray sound is ""upgraded"" to lossess 5.1 with respect to the compressed DVD audio, there is no separate stereo track as there is on the DVD, which can be useful for those of us who think surround is a gimmick to get us to spend more money on speakers and new receivers.

Edit: I just realized that a possible/probable origin for the echo is a poorly implemented pitch preserving slowdown of the audio to match the ""PAL speeddown"" from 25fps to 24fps.",1406160000,2,1810,4.646875
5892594,5,B00E688AZE,"I finished watching Farscape for the first time not too long ago. My husband and I ordered it from Amazon for $49, so it was a fantastic deal! I can say that Farscape was a brilliant show: excellent writing, amazing actors (and characters) who clearly had a blast making this show, beautifully made puppets courtesy of the Creature Shop, and tons of fun to be had. I've seen reviews where people say ""I tried watching this but didn't get into it. Maybe if it was more like Star Trek."", but Farscape is not Star Trek. You can't compare every sci-fi show to Star Trek. Farscape has it all: heartbreak, sacrifice, love, lots of arguments, and genuinely awesome storytelling. I had such a blast watching this show. I loved the characters. It was just SO good! The commentaries on this set are really good, especially the Claudia Black/ Ben Browder ones, and the ones with Anthony Simcoe. If you haven't seen this, don't let the negative reviews sway you. Farscape is one of the BEST shows of all time!

5892600,3,B00E688AZE,"I would like to say this is a great cut, and visually, it is.  The transfer is incredibly well done. I would easily give this five stars if only the audio was properly produced.

However, who ever did the audio did a really bad job.  This isn't to say the audio in itself is bad, but the levels are all over the place.  Think of audio broken up into three parts: speech, music, audio effects.

Consistently, the music and the audio effects are always louder than the speech.  If I want to hear the speech, I would increase the volume.  When the audio effects and/or music came on, it would be so loud, I would have to turn it down.  So I would turn on the CC, to view the video.

Another problem with the sound is sync.  I tried these discs on a variety of BD players, and the audio is about four frames off, which was annoying.  Since I have a LOT of BDs, and watch them regularly on my BD player and the associated system, I question very seriously if there is something wrong with my BD player, and I have to point the finger at the production of the BDs.

No mistake, I truly enjoy this series (your milage may differ), and my wife and I enjoy the relationship that develops between Aeryn and John.",1405209600,3,1202,4.200873362445415

I was given this set with no expectations and got little out of it (soon understood why only first season was unwrapped).  Why two stars then?

5892632,3,B00E688AZE,"FARSCAPE: THE COMPLETE SERIES (15TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION) is produced by Jim Henson Productions, Hallmark Entertainment, Jim Henson Television, Nine Film & Television Pty. Ltd., Nine Network Australia, and the Sci-Fi Channel. DVD distribution for this release is being handled by Cinedigm and New Video.
My wife discovered this series in bits and pieces over the last six years or so on random discovery trips into our satellite stations. We did not have any cable or satellite available to us where we live when the series first debuted so it was all-new to us.
My wife enjoyed the episodes we watched so when I saw it on sale I bought the entire series and the Peacekeeper Wars for her as a birthday gift.
The first two years of the series were interesting, full of humor and bonded us to the cast and concepts.
In the third season they went off the reservation with a lot of repeated scenes from previous episodes and a god-awful cartoon parody that was, for us, one of the most annoying episodes of any show anywhere ever. Two Crichton's was another distraction.
It was an amazing feat that even with all the distractions we viewers were able to see the cast rally and destroy not only a giant Peacekeeper station but also overcome masterminds and insurmountable threats.
The loss of the redeemed Crais and Talyn was regrettable.
Then the diabolical Furlow not only gets the drop on Chrichton and Aeryn betraying them to the enemy but she is able to destroy the benevolent and super evolved Old One most primitively and destroy half of John Crichton. If there was a message in this we didn't get it. We were thinking say it isn't so.
The loss of Zhaan (played by Virginia Hey) was a huge blow for us and Stark (played by Paul Goddard) morphing into a pathetic fool from a gifted spiritualist and then somewhere in between seemed out of character.
For us Scorpious probably should have been killed off or at least banished to somewhere to emerge from time to time in his real form by the end of the third season. He was a character we had loved to hate and then he became an almost father figure to the fugitives on board Moya. We had some empathy for him when his early years were revealed but he committed so many dastardly acts We did not see anything hastening his path to redemption.
The introduction of Commandant Grayza and Sikozu kept the plot moving along but WE felt the ever-changing loyalties and ridicules and childish acts of endangering the group by Chiana and Rygel flew over the cookoo nest once too often. Sikozu could have had a Mr. Spock quality with her scientific knowledge and penchant to plan well. She would have been greater in our opinion as a rival leader to the charismatic Chricton and the authorative DArgo instead of a constantly inconsistent Scorpious acolyte.
Season 4 started with the John Quixote, Kansas and Bad Timing episodes and these were distracting and trite as far as we were concerned. Events with far reaching disturbance to the space-time continuum offered nothing new and the Chiana foolery was annoying.
It is our belief that this could have been one of the all time great Science Fictions series. Season three jumped the shark with the cartoon episode and then the subsequent poor start to Season Four sunk the series. We started to go from dying to see the next episode to falling asleep in the middle of them.
The sound quality of the DVD was poor. There are no sub-titles available in the set up but we were able to synchronize the DVD with the internal close captioning in our Sony and that helped immensely.
All in all the series was probably a lot better than average but what started out with so much promise just fizzled for us.  It is no small wonder there was no season five for the writers to pull things back together and bring the faithful back to the fold.
The cast was wonderful and we recognized a few of the guest characters from other shows like Legend of the Seeker. They did a great job. We suppose that with all the makeup and costume changes it must have been insanely difficult for them. They should get ten stars as a group!
The special effects, mix of puppets and the living, the various sets and the ship Moya itself was amazing and worth the full purchase price. We would encourage everyone to purchase Farscape there is nothing on today that we can acess comparable or better overall. So many of the episodes were five star quality.",1398643200,,4412,4.620382165605095

5892641,1,B00E688AZE,"Honestly this series is very overrated. Almost every episode is set inside Moya and the plots are repetitive and boring and almost always involve the main characters turning on each other or some level of mistrust which gets so tiring after the first dozen repetitions.

It was so painful for me to sit through the first two seasons and it really pains me to write this review because I wanted to love this so much. I found out about Farscape along with Lexx and I hate to compare both but yeah, this one wasn't for me. I guess if you like facial close-ups and tons of dialogue, yeah. It's really a character-driven show.

Not very epic or visually-driven, which is what I got with Lexx. There's not a lot of anything, really. The only character I loved gets killed off in the beginning of Season 3. I wanted to love this a lot and I just want to say I'm not hating on it, I know many people like this, but I can't for the LIFE OF ME understand why. I keep popping an episode every once in a while to give it another shot but I always fall asleep since it's so monotonous...oh, well.",1397347200,5,1083,4.278048780487805

5892643,5,B00E688AZE,"I had seen some of Farscape when it was on tv years ago.  I didn't follow it from beginning to end.  When we decided to spend the winter watching different sci-fi series, this was one that was on my list.  The serialized nature of shows like Farscape require you to watch in sequence and not miss an episode, which is why I didn't keep following it back in pre-Netflix days.  While this serialized nature does not lend itself to picking it up anywhere along the line, it makes for deeper storytelling.  Research its Wikia page if you need more story details before purchase.  I don't want to spoil anything!

Farscape has such a good feel for making sci-fi so much more alien than shows like Star Trek but yet keeps it human enough to enjoy.  The puppet-work for the main aliens is well done.  Like most any sci-fi show, the special fx start off somewhat cheesy but improve over time.  The main cast seems to portray these characters in a way where they grow and change over time, much in the way the stories would cause them to.

The Blu-ray set is a good way to go.  It has all the episodes, many with commentary.  It has a ton of other special features.  It is a good value for the sheer volume of content.  The video is great.  I understand that the original footage shot was lost somehow, so the resolution is not as great as true HD, being processed and upconverted from the broadcast video.  Still, it is very crisp and for the most part better than DVD quality images.  The audio is improved and what you would expect from most any blu-ray.

All in all, it was a great way to spend winter evenings to relax.",1397088000,,1615,4.359060402684563

5892647,5,B00E688AZE,"First of all I am so glad to find a complete box set of one of my all-time favorite shows.  The picture on the blue ray is much superior to the previous DVD issues.  This show did not get the recognition that it deserved when it was on the air and that was a shame.  The show could at times be silly, but that was one of the things that made it great, and it only became better as it went on unlike most shows.  The only real disappointment is that the Peacekeeper Wars mini series was not included and is still not available on blue ray but for the price of this set it can not be beat.",1396310400,,587,3.907563025210084
5892648,4,B00E688AZE,"Farscape is an odd show, no doubts there. The plots are bizarre, there are muppets galore, and the characters aren't afraid to have sex. But the show does grow on you. What really appeals to me about the show is the richness of the main characters. They're beautifully and subtly written. I definitely recommend the series.

It's a bit of a shame then that the video quality isn't as good as it might be on these blu-rays. The show was filmed as TV was making the switch to HD, so while the image quality is good it's not as rich as you might get even from the Star Trek: The Next Generation blu-rays. Part of the problem is that Farscape is generally a dark show so detail doesn't pop out.

The show itself is available on Netflix or Amazon Prime, so you don't really need the blu-rays just to be able to watch the show. However, the commentaries and extra features on the blu-rays are worthwhile. The creators of the show share some interesting insights. Some of the best are buy composer Guy Gross. I don't know if alone they're worth the price of this set, but if you can get it on a deal (and I've seen this set go on Amazon's Lightning Deals frequently) it'd be worth it for fans.",1396310400,8,1186,4.337837837837838

So obviously I am a huge fan of the show.  I bought this set hoping that this Blu-Ray release is higher enough image quality to be worthwhile, and for me it certainly is!  It is noticeably sharper with richer colors  than the original DVD release, and an unexpected treat for me is that the audio is scads better as well!  There are also a lot of extras, which I didn't expect, as many reviewers said there was nothing new in the way of extras.  But I'm upgrading from the original DVD sets, which were a big step up from watching the show when it first aired, and if you are an addicted fan like myself, you owe it to yourself to get this set.  Not to mention that it takes up 1/4 as much space as my original set takes up.",1396051200,,956,4.053191489361702

5892652,5,B00E688AZE,"Watching the series again now, after four years or so since I last watched it.  And I forget just how much I enjoyed this show.

I'm a big fan of actual character development, and this show has it to the gills.  The growth of the characters through the series is very well done, more so than just about any other series.

And the characters are a great mix.  The way they interact with each other in the beginning, then grow as a cohesive unit isn't the saccharine junk that most series have, it's a rocky uphill climb and there's a lot of stumbling they all do.  Which really presents a much more ""realistic"" environment.

The special effects range from great to laughable, but at least for me, it's not a distraction since most of the time it's pretty well done.  Even Rygel, the muppet, doesn't distract me at all from the suspension of disbelief.

Some of the shows are deep, some are shallow, some are absolutely hilarious.  It seems that we, as a species, always enjoy seeing the ""contemporary"" earthling in out of this world situations.  Star Trek tried to capitalize on it several times, as have many other series.  I think this one does it best, as the lead character really carries it off so bloody well.

The downside is that it's done in 4:3 through I think the third season if I recall correctly, but the transfer looks very well on my 55"" LED TV, and the surround sound is more than adequate for my tastes.

I got this on a gold box offer, and couldn't pass up the price.  And it's worth every penny.

If you enjoy space themed shows, and can handle something that's not just all space battles and shooting, but character driven stories, then this one is definitely worth  checking out if you haven't seen it yet.  Too bad they cut it loose after season 4, but at least they were able to wrap up many of the story arcs with the mini series ""The Peacekeeper Wars.""  That, however, is not included in this set, so make sure you pick it up otherwise the cliffhanger in Season 4 is just frustrating.",1395014400,3,2009,4.425068119891008

Watched the first season online then checked to see it it was available on Blu-ray, saw that it was being offered at Amazon at a fantastically discounted price but hesitated on pulling the trigger due to the various reports saying that this set was merely an upconverted version of the PAL masters (since the original 35mm source prints are still missing and assumed lost). Read more reviews, checked out screenshots and figured I could live with less-than-stellar picture quality, made the purchase. Upon receiving the set and viewing the first couple episodes, I am here to tell you that it looks FANTASTIC despite not being ""true"" HD. Color register is true, image is sharp and doesn't look overly processed, blacks are deep and fidelity is absolutely above average. I'm pretty picky when it comes to HD and am very happy with the job they did on bringing this show to Blu-ray. If you're on the fence about ordering this, don't be.

The writing was very creative which explains the success of the show. If you have never seen  this show and are a sci-fi fan you must see this.,1393718400,2,265,4.096153846153846

The series was cancelled before they resolved everything so you'll want to have the TV movie finale on hand to watch as soon as you're done with the last episode.  I mistakenly thought that this box set would include it.

The Henson Company did wonders with this show.  Aliens that are unique and nonhumanoid is still all too uncommon outside of CGI or animation.  I wish more studios would do what Farscape did.",1393286400,2,477,4.619047619047619

I was so diappointed when it was cancelled, and thrilled when they did a movie to tie up all the loose ends, so I purchased both. Can hardly wait to have time to have a marathon day or few days. Loved the characters, stories/episdoes, the running theme and new plots, the ship, the settings, everything about it.

If I was disappointed in any way it was with the bonus material.  I had hoped for more ""making of"" type stuff.  Most of the bonus material is commentary by actors and directors dubbed over the voice track.  Some of that can be entertaining but mostly I find it a waste of time.  The best bonus material was the interviews with Guy Gross, the program's composer.  For musicians, it's quite interesting.  Overall, a good purchase.",1392422400,2,547,4.577319587628866

The Jim Henson Company out-did themselves with characters in the entire series. Had to repeat some of the episodes to understand the story line but then that could just be me.  Seasons 3 & 4 did quite a bit of flashing back and jumping around but always connected in the end.

5892679,5,B00E688AZE,"This has to be one of the best Sy-Fy series made so far. If you want to see what the definition of ""alien"" is watch this. Some of the most imaginative characters, sets, effects and stories. You will see things NO other Sy-Fy has or mostly likely will ever show. It's fast paced, exciting and at times funnier than you would expect from something like this. It's one of those series where you end up really caring about what happens to the characters and then sorry when you reach the end because there is no more to watch. Even the final ending in ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" is done perfectly.

That's the show and this release is very high quality. The first three seasons is not in wide screen format but that is because the original series wasn't shot in wide screen until the forth season. Don't know where they got the masters for this release but it looks great. Easily the same audio and video quality as any other Blu Ray title and this time with sub-titles.

The advertisements don't mention that, which in my mind is fraud.  I don't care about different production companies (the original series studio were idiots for canceling the show - what Einstein made that decision?), the fans DESERVE TO GET THE COMPLETE AND TOTAL SERIES.

As expected, the re-runs on cable are what they are....grainy, sound is choppy at times, etc. To be clear, I'm a lover of Farscape, not a snob of it, thus, I don't review every frame with an audio/visual microscope, and I never saw it on DVD. I'm now working towards about halfway into season 2 (Zan sprouted flower buds on her face, shot spores into the air, and nearly ate one of her crew members for a high protein snack!), and what I've appreciated over and over is that the picture is clear, the sound is clear, and it basically looks like the program was created recently, not over a decade ago.

It's a Great Facelift from the DVD sets I currently own, but That's where it ends.

I've been waiting for Farscape in Stunning 1080p HD on my Tv. Well the menu's are just that!
AWESOME LOOKING, when you choose your episode.........

4:3 Picture. They took the DVD Prints and Put them on Blu-Ray. Your tv says 1080p, but it's a 4:3 image on your

I've had the series since Christmas and been watching it ever since. I just became a fan of the series not to long ago when it air on Pivot.

I liked everything about the series except for the season finale of the final season. It ended on a cliff hanger. But luckily I came back to Amazon to purchase Peacekeeper Wars.

5892702,5,B00E688AZE,"There are numerous, very detailed reviews already posted which clearly and effectively explain the ""Farscape"" story arc.  Given this, I will keep my posting very brief, and primarily focus on the ""quality"" of this particular, Farscape : The Complete Series , 15th Anniversary Edition, 27 disc, DVD set.  The outer decorative box houses a total of 5 separate standard size disc cases, with each case holding multiple discs.  The first four cases, each having 6 discs, contain the 4 complete seasons of ""Farscape"".  The 5th case holds 3 discs of bonus material and special features.  The actual disc cases seem to be of high quality, not prone to breaking, and the DVD discs appear to be of premium grade.  All of the artwork, including on the face of the discs, is fresh and updated for this 15th Anniversary set release.  All in all, this is a very nice and attractive box set.  Please note, that this set DOES NOT contain the ""Farscape : The Peacekeeper Wars"" 2-part movie conclusion, which as of now can be purchased separately for less than ten dollars.  Be sure to order that update conclusion, also, if you don't already have it in your collection.

When using a nice upscaling disc player, and viewing on a decent quality HDTV, the picture quality is EXCELLENT!!!  The colors are vibrantly brilliant, the contrast is highly dynamic, and the resolution clarity is very strong (nearly razor sharp during many of the scenes).  Overall, on a scale of 1 through 10, I would have to suggest that the offered picture quality is a very solid ""9"", even when using widescreen stretch mode.  In my case, I was viewing the material on a 47"" 1080p display.  So, results may vary somewhat when viewing on larger screens beyond that range.  Given that ""Farscape"" happens to be a weekly episode type television series from 15 years ago, the picture display is surprisingly strong, and offers a great visual experience even now in current times.  The playback from the DVD discs within this set happens to be very smooth, consistent, and trouble free.  VERY NICE!!!

This Farscape : The Complete Series, 15th Anniversary Edition, 27 disc, DVD set offers 2 different option selections regarding the audio.  You can either choose the original 2-channel Dolby Surround soundtrack, or the re-processed and enhanced 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround audio.  Both selections are of very high quality, and the 5.1 option sounds particularly strong when used with a nice surround sound system with appropriate settings applied.  Both audio track options offer more than ample volume range.
GREAT AUDIO!!!

""Farscape"" offers legitimate Science Fiction story telling at its VERY BEST.  This series perfectly blends high quality production techniques, spectacular acting, stellar set props and wardrobe costumes, and more than enough sarcastic humor and ironic circumstances to suit anyone's entertainment appetite.  Overall, the production quality of ""Farscape"" by far surpasses any other science fiction or fantasy type series from that same era (and there were some pretty darn good ones).  When watching this series now, by way of this particular DVD set, the show feels just as ""fresh"" and relevant as it had when it was current.
THIS SERIES TRULY WITHSTANDS THE TEST OF TIME VERY WELL ! ! !

As of right now, pricing on this set (to your mailbox) seems to vary by as much as twenty dollars (from lowest to highest).  So, please do your homework, and compare prices between trusted sources prior to ordering.
GOOD LUCK!!!

This is truly a 5 Star DVD set of a 5 Star science fiction series. NICE!!!

I am still in the process of watching Farscape season 1 since I received this yesterday.  I have seen the show before and I have enjoyed it quite a bit.

I have chosen to buy the dvd version of the series due the blu-rays having  only the comic as the difference between the two versions...

I however have taken the time to checkout some of the special features discs (Farscape Undressed and Memories of Moya were quite good) and have noticed a problem... One of the features listed on the label of Disc 1 (of 3) titled:

Psychotically Ambitious: A Farscape Reunion

Is not present on the disc nor is it on any of the other DVDs...

This could very well be a disc labeling error, as I am at this time unable to find any mention of this feature on google.

5892714,5,B00E688AZE,"Around Christmas, my wife decided to buy me this set as a present. We'd been watching the PIVOT channel together and the countless Farscape-a-thons had apparently done something beautiful, reinforcing fandom. In the past I'd tried to get her to watch but to no avail, then the show couple with advertisements for this 15th anniversary edition made her want to buy it. I kind of think it was because she made it past the introduction to season 1, which I personally love but that has some pacing issues early on. The show looks pretty good on this transfer - its a lot like the DVD to be honest with a marginal increase in the picture at the most, but this transfer is a lot better than watching countless sessions on TV. I would have liked to have the movie on the set as well, but since the movie can be purchased for fairly cheap it isn't much of an issue.
For those who don't know, John Crichton is an astronaut who ended up blundering through a wormhole only to find himself in the middle of some rather exciting times. To quote him: My name is John Crichton ... I'm lost ... An astronaut ... Shot through a wormhole ... In some distant part of the universe ... I'm trying to stay ALIVE ... Aboard this ship ... This living ship ... Of escaped prisoners ... My friends ... If you can hear me ... Beware ... If I make it back ... Will they follow? ... If I open the door ... Are you ready? ... Earth is unprepared ... Helpless ... For the nightmares ... I have seen ... Or should I stay? ... Protect my home ... Not show them ... You exist ... But then you'll never know ... The wonders I have seen.
 Ive always been thankful that Farscape hails from a time when shows had long seasons. Sure you end up with only 4 of those beauties, but those account for 88 episodes.  The storyline is smart and the dialog is brilliant, especially when exchanged by our way-too-often underestimated human narrator and some of his colleagues. Rigel has always always one of my favorites, because Id never thought Henson would supply me with such a greedy, mean-spirited but all-around-fun monarch. You have some tragic moments come and some beloved characters go, experiencing the loss of what is attributable to friends you get to know pretty well. Couple that with great special effects, eye-catching alien landscapes, and interesting creatures and you have the makings of something that was thankfully not forgotten.
If you don't own the series, this is a nice set to own. Im not partial to the packaging, with a glossy box and  4 DVD cases holding my assortment of discs, but they do their job well enough up and this isn't about the veneer. The transfer is good considering when and how Farscape was produced, looking pretty sexy on my TV when all that escaped prisoner goodness pops off. Couple that with excellent 5.1; my surround sound system seems to irritate my neighbors  with frequent explosions and half-baked human plans, and you have something far beyond the reruns. If you do own the DVDs, I think you are upgrading the picture a tad in my opinion, with the treatment looking pretty good. Some do not seem to share that opinion, so if you have a friend with the set then compare it if you prefer. Also note that if you have the previous Bluray set, then you are getting the same transfers. Theres subtitles, deleted scenes and TV spots, as well as a comic that shouldnt have been hyped in my opinion make up the lot.",1389052800,3,3419,4.48314606741573

As with most good television, this series was cancelled before the story was finished. The fans were NOT having it, though, and they orchestrated a campaign to finish the show that included internet petitions, media buys, and grass roots activism the likes of which we've rarely seen. Similar to what happened with ""Firefly"", the story was completed in the form of a more-than-feature-length film that tied up most of the loose ends left hanging by the abrupt cancellation. Advice for anyone watching for the first time: Start at the beginning, and PAY ATTENTION! The story is more than complicated, as are the characters, so don't think you can just ""pick it up"" as you go. Everything that happens is important in one way or another, and you'll be left scratching your head in perplexment if you aren't 100% committed. Do yourself a favor and buy the complete series.

We were extremely dissapointed to hear the 5th and final season would be cancelled due to the Sci-Fi acquistion of a Lessor series.

Fantastic series, worth watching without knowing what to expect. Ignore all reviews & spoilers,just watch it. I didn't like the hype or standard tv series gimmicks when it was on Sci-fi. However the actors will make you return, & develop affection for the many character arcs & overall feel of the farscape universe. Only 1 or 2 characters in the entire series will make you loathe them, but that adds to the reality of the show. Jim Henson proves quality puppeteering demands a place in sci-fi,& any adult themed show. CGI aliens look so cheap compared to real puppets & costume work. Definitely under developed & under appreciated. Of all the garbage shows that run 10 seasons, Farscape deserved the decade treatment.

It stands on its own , the story telling is good, the characters are appealing, and it has enough element of surprise to have you eagerly waiting for the next episode. Actually, it's hard to maintain discipline and watch just one episode per night (we settled for two).

The show does have some inherent problems (shared with Star Trek, Star Wars and others) like the abundance of humanoid species, M-class (they don't call them that) planets, etc. and the theme of being perpetually chased and looking for a way home (Voyager and a bit of Galactica), but I guess no show that is superrealistic would be successful in TV (no noise in space, no intergalactic travel, no unrecognizable species, etc.).

The puppet characters aren't worse than Yoda, so that too is acceptable.

I believe that if you're willing to give some slack, this would be a pleasant experience, it sure has been for me and my family.",1386806400,,1064,4.6436170212765955

I then changed the TV input back and forth. The result...The Blu Ray didn't look any better than the DVD. This is obviously a bang bang upscale release with nothing down to tweek quality. In fact there were times when I thought my DVD looked better.

5892757,4,B00E688AZE,"Blu-ray review.

Please note that the reissue contains the same transfers and commentary tracks as the previous Blu-ray edition. Unfortunately , we  don't have ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" still has been released on Blu-ray in the U.S.  This edition might have been worth while picking up again IF that had been licensed as an extra.  There isn't enough new material here to justify repurchasing for most fans.

""Farscape"" came at a good time providing a bridge during a key time when most science fiction on TV was ""Star Trek"" or nothing else (""Babylon 5"" excepted) and it brought a much needed dollop of humor, fascinating storylines and great characterizations. It's true that the series presents a hodge podge of ideas that were successful in other shows from ""Star Trek"" to ""The X-Files"" but what was great as with all things that are an amalgamation of other ideas from other shows was how it was put together.

""Farscape: The Complete Series"" is, well, somewhat incomplete. While it includes all four seasons it doesn't include the mini-series ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"" due to licensing issues with Lion's Gate (which released that title)so you'll need to keep your DVD set for that until the latter is released on Blu-ray.

The Blu-ray presentation for ""Farscape"" suffers a bit from the fact that it was produced prior to studios thinking of high definition. The show was shot on film but the visual effects were done in digital standard definition, that wouldn't be a problem but the show was assembled in standard video as well and the 35mm source prints  are nowhere to be found.

The first three seasons are in full screen as it was originally presented. The fourth is widescreen also as it was originally broadcast.

Having said that the New Video used a number of digital techniques to enhance the SD picture and bring it into the high def realm for a decent looking transfer.

Subtitles ARE on the Blu-ray release.

If you adjust your expectations that this ISN'T going to look as good as, say, ""Battlestar: Galatica"" on Blu-ray or even the original ""Star Trek"", you'll enjoy this set. Should you buy it? That depends on how picky you're going to be about teh image quality here but this does look marginally better than previous editions.

As a result we have a Blu-ray presentation that isn't in 1080 instead New Video the distributor here had to go to the best source possible the PAL video (which has higher resolution than U.S. NTSC)thus while this isn't in high definition it DOES look slightly better than the the regular DVD's in particular because the higher bit rate for Blu-ray allows the show more ""breathing"" room. The show looks soft but there's no way around that. Detail is better than the 2009 DVD's but the compression artifacts that were problematic for the DVD set released in 2009 aren't as problematic here. Likewise, this is a huge upgrade over the ""Starburst"" editions of the series put out a couple of years back.

The audio is a big upgrade with a lossless 5.1 presentation that is quite powerful and well done.

The special features from the previous 2009 set have been carried over for this set with one new high def featurette included looking back on the show. We get mulitple commentary tracks for a number of episodes (with the first season getting the most).

The box states that there are 35 commentary tracks but, unless I'm missing something, this has exactly the same amount as the previous edition.

Summary: -video quality: Is soft but with better detail than most of the DVDs I've seen of the show because the producers used the higher resolution PAL video masters. The encoding and use of compression here is an improvement as well helping the picture quality. It's a marginal upgrade in image quality though.

Audio: Sounds brilliant with a nice, immersive 5.1 lossless mix.

Special Features: All of the special features from the 2009 A&E/New Video release are included with a 16 page hard copy comic book which also includes a brief interview with Brian Henson discussing the legacy of the show.

We also get deleted scenes and TV spots.
