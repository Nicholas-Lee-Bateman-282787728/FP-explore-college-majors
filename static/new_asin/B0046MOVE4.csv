4270178,4,B0046MOVE4,"Although, there are too many coincidences, this is still well worth watching. Michael Kitchen is such an excellent actor. He comes across as a complicated human being, even though he is responsible for something truly evil, and that is not the rape. At the end, one wonders how many judges and lawyers  are dispensing ""justice"" and are guilty of their own crimes.",1308700800,2,363,4.854838709677419
4270179,5,B0046MOVE4,"This was a great movie with superb acting. It was difficult to watch Michael Kitchen in the role of a scoundrel after having viewed his performance in the complete Foyle's War series. Nevertheless, it was a great performance. I was totally engrossed in the film from beginning to end and there were many surprises and unexpected turns. I watched the entire film in one sitting and was glad that I did, it was engrossing and entertaining. Now I need to find more films like this one. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story and quality acting.",1306886400,,564,4.65

4270181,5,B0046MOVE4,"This movie is a little-known treat. Michael Kitchen has to be one of the greatest unheralded actors of our time. This is a suspenseful little yarn about the well-intended mistakes we make during desperate times, and how they come back to haunt us, with interest!

Kitchen has the complexity to share the thoughts and discarded possibilities flashing across his face as he maneuvers to set things right. You will care deeply about the characters, be fully engaged, and forget to take a deep breath. Surprisingly you will feel satisfied with the ending as well. If you enjoy suspense, complexity, mystery and brushes of fate, you'll enjoy this delicious treat.

4270183,3,B0046MOVE4,"The following may, for some, contain spoilers.

The main reason, in my view, for watching this British mini-series is the performance of the reliably-excellent Michael Kitchen, here playing against type as Steven Vey, a successful barrister and a man as arrogant as he is amoral. Though married, Vey has eyes for a young secretary in his office. She is sufficiently flattered by his flirting that the two end up one evening after work at her apartment. Sensing that she has allowed things to go too far, she tries to end their evening together, but Vey is not about to be rebuffed, and he proceeds to force himself on the young woman. Not long after this incident, Vey receives a coveted appointment to the bench. The young woman, wanting some sense of justice but believing that she would have little chance of getting it in court, contacts Vey with an offer: if he resigns his judgeship, she will remain quiet about what he did to her; if he does not, she will go public.

The stage is set for a promising drama, which makes what follows all the more disappointing. First, the story shifts from London to Birmingham and to a young petty thief, Eddy Doyle. Doyle learns from his mother that the man he thought was his father is actually his adoptive father, that his biological father is a man by the name of...  Steven Vey! Learning this, Doyle is off to London to try to locate Vey. In what follows, the story goes off the rails, at least it did for me, because of the coincidences the writers invoke to intersect the paths of Doyle and Vey and of Doyle and the young lady who was Vey's victim. If you are tolerant of these preposterous twists, then you will probably be as impressed with this mini-series as others here are. The performance of Michael Kitchen makes this worth watching but not, in my opinion, worth owning.",1299974400,22,1827,4.581039755351682
4270184,5,B0046MOVE4,"Too many coincidences, but just ignore them as they occur and sit back and enjoy the taut script and fine acting...",1294358400,11,115,4.523809523809524
4270185,5,B0046MOVE4,"A complex story of intense intrigue, a killer thriller, and a psychological character masterpiece. The mega-suspense end deserves a writing award for Simon Burke.

First one must overcome seeing Michael Kitchen as antagonist (NOT THE WONDERFUL MR. FOYLE'S WAR HERE.) A ten-year younger Kitchen plays nasty lawyer Steven Vey superbly. In the dialogue Vey admits he's ""a devious, immoral, hypocrite."" 3 hours later, after the story ends, you will agree with him, even though his ailing mother does not.

An adopted ex-con seeking his real dad, his pals, a raped secretary (Caroline Catz-`Doc Martin), & her flat-mate Tanya all get caught up in conspiracy connected to the appointment of Vey as judge. Secrets and the unknown create a woven maze of actions and intents on everyone associated. Who will die or live becomes independent of the group's individuals to control. Masterful complexity of events set into motion due to individual decisions. It all began with a bottle.

Quite different, but excellent executed roles, by the pre-`Foyle's War' Kitchen, as well as the pre-`Doc Martin' Catz. ""THE GUILTY"" proves the depth and diversity of acting ability of this famous pair between 1992-2011. This double feature length, 2-DVD set, will grip and knot every nerve. It is British unrated, but definitely adult (NO KIDS) due to graphic violence, content, 1 breast visual, and it's not your feel-good moral finale. I'm surprised this was not placed into book form--a sure bestseller.

SUBTITLES. Some cast filmographies. Disc 2 offers a summary of episode one, in case you can't watch it all in one setting. Unneeded. The intensity will force you to watch it all straight through.

Watch this thriller in the AM so you don't have to sleep immediately afterward.
The next morning, to recover, watch ""Foyles War"" or ""Doc Martin.""",1289606400,50,1825,5.1313131313131315

4270187,5,B0046MOVE4,"I have watched The Guilty several times now and I absolutely love it. I've been a big fan of Michael Kitchen ever since I first saw him in ""Reckless"" (both original and sequel) on PBS Masterpiece Theater and then of course as Christopher Foyle in ""Foyle's War"" which is one of the best series ever made for TV.  Mr. Kitchen's character in The Guilty is multilayered and he is just wonderful to watch. Caroline Catz is wonderful as well and The Guilty shows her acting chops. I've been watching her as DS Morton in DCI Banks and her character is a terrific addition to that crime drama series.  I highly recommend ""The Guilty"" especially for Michael Kitchen's superb performance and the story is an extremely interesting one.",1445126400,2,724,4.692913385826771

4270190,5,B0046MOVE4,"This excellent, two-part psychological thriller from ITV, 1991, demonstrates that 'justice isn't always served.'  A chance to see Caroline Catz before her affected performances in 'Doc Martin' and 'Murder in Suburbia.'  A good way to spend 3 1/2 hours even though the all to realistic ending leaves one feeling a bit empty.",1429920000,,323,5.1923076923076925

4270193,3,B0046MOVE4,"The Guilty is an engrossing drama and worth watching, but I agree with those who found the plot contrivances ridiculous and distracting. But the other problem is that I honestly couldn't imagine the elegant, delicate featured Michael Kitchen raping the sultry cow-eyed Carolyn Catz. Who could believe him weeping on his mothers breast or coming from a lower class neighborhood where people hang their washing out on lines? Aside from that, on the positive side, the evolution of this character is almost Shakespearean, and I liked the way justice came about in an unexpected way.",1422748800,,579,5.105263157894737
4270194,5,B0046MOVE4,Fantastic movie.,1421712000,,16,7.5
4270195,5,B0046MOVE4,"The Guilty is a two-part TV movie that offers up an amazing amount of twists and turns and double-backs to its clever, dense script, creating complex characterizations fitted into a rape/murder mystery storyline that actually does deliver on that old clich: it leaves you guessing right up to the end.

Amoral and ambitious barrister Steven Vey has a drunken moment with his new secretary where his aggression gets out of hand--setting in motion a crazily intricate plot: the traumatized secretary, having given up on any legal recourse, threatens to go to the tabloids with her story. Vey's hitherto unknown son comes to London seeking to meet his real father; after a chance encounter, Vey offers the young man (whom he still doesn't know is his son) a job: to eliminate his problem with the secretary. But the son has, by coincidence, met the secretary and started falling in love with her.

This is an absolutely first-class thriller from the U.K. for it fashions another complex and thoroughly ambiguous drama grafted onto a standard murder mystery framework and then pulls out the stops to with clever twists and double-backs. Michael Kitchen, Sean Gallagher and Caroline Catz are excellent here. One of the best made-for-TV dramas I've seen. It is more of a character study and the complexities of being human. Highly recommended for people who likes good films.",1418256000,,1369,5.026431718061674

I am a huge fan of Michael Kitchen and Caroline Catz and they were both wonderful in it. I wasn't familiar with Sean Gallagher but I was very impressed and will look for other films with him now. The film is well acted and the plot is intriguing despite the incredible number of coincidences. It's a very, very enjoyable example of British mystery, time well spent.",1395446400,,476,4.546511627906977
4270209,5,B0046MOVE4,Foyle's War will not define Kitchen. This is a great example of his range as an actor. He is a great British import.,1395360000,,116,4.086956521739131
4270210,4,B0046MOVE4,"I discovered a copy at the library.  I'm glad I snatched it.  This movie is the epitome of the resources of the wealthy to overcome scandal.  There are multiple plots within the story and Michael Kitchen delivers an exceptionally convincing villain.  Some of the acting was not as good however, the main story was powerful enough and moved quickly enough to have you holding your breath for the next twist.  The motivations of the various characters were well handled and mostly believable. I found the ending particularly surprising and yet it wasn't (a little mystery in a review never hurt anyone, ay?).

If you are looking for a clever story with complicated characters, this will be a movie worth your time.  It delivers high level suspense time and again.",1394841600,,761,4.852713178294573

4270227,5,B0046MOVE4,"For fans of Michael Kitchen (Foyle's War), this 1991 film is a must see. Kitchen plays Steven Vey, a successful millionaire lawyer, self-described as alcoholic, cynical, and amoral. Drunk following a court victory and celebration, he rapes a young secretary from his office, played by Caroline Catz (Doc Martin). He's remorseful, but not that remorseful. When she won't accept his apology, he fires her. She wants revenge, and sees her opportunity when Vey is named as Britain's youngest High Court Judge.

A side-story features Sean Gallagher (Coronation Street) as the illegitimate son Vey never knew existed. OK, there are some Dickensian coincidences, but I didn't mind. This is a two-disc video that runs to 3 hours and 20 minutes, and I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them.",1323302400,,780,5.141732283464567

Unfortunately this isn't it. Writing is below par. Sometimes slow moving isn't a bad thing, but it was here. I could describe the plot to give my viewpoint more credibility, but it's just not worth it. Feeling very disappointed.

Being too much a fan, I let my curiosity get the better of me. But really now I wish I'd just let it go and spent the money on something worthwhile, (like a season of Foyle's War). Just saying. :-(

4270232,5,B0046MOVE4,"A very good mystery story with a surprize ending.  The main character (Michael Kitchen) plays a less-than-reputable, arrogant lawyer who regrets his indiscretion, but is totally oblivious to the impact of his action.  He thinks only of himself and unwittingly is introduced to his son.  The plot is surprizingly complex posing lots of emotional questions for all characters involved.  I enjoyed this fresh ""turn of events"" as well as Michael Kitchen's acting.",1313366400,2,459,5.333333333333333
4270233,5,B0046MOVE4,"If you have never seen Michael Kitchen in anything but FOYLE'S WAR, you are in for a treat.  Because he is every bit as good at playing the bad guy as he was playing good guy Foyle. In this delicious little gem, he plays a top level barrister with his eye on a judgeship. He is the very embodiment of unbridled ambition and he doesn't care whom he has to sacrifice to get what he wants.  He also has a tendency to drink too much.

He leaves victims in his wake.  There is an illegitimate child now grown to manhood who has just been released from prison.  There is a young woman in chambers whom he raped after having once again too many drinks. They want justice.  Although justice is his business, it plays no part in his personal life.

Kitchen is able to play the many sides of this villain.  He can be charming, brilliant, appealing and, in an instant, very cold blooded.

i highly recommend this.

4270235,5,B0046MOVE4,"Two actors who have become well known in the US (at least by watchers of British TV on PBS stations) are Michael Kitchen in Foyle's War and Caroline Catz in Doc Martin.  Impressed by both, I looked to see what other movies each had made and discovered both were in this film, ""The Guilty"" a 201 minute mini-series shown on British TV almost 20 years ago--which has only recently been released on DVD.  Kitchen was well established in Britain by 1992 (the date of the film) but, except for a small role as a receptionist in a single episode of a long running sitcom, it was Catz's first film-she was 22 years old.

The movie is simply terrific-gripping until the very end and though there are some spoilers in reviews and commentary on Amazon.com, very suspensful throughout.  I can't remember when my wife and I were last so engrossed in a movie and I am amazed that it hasn't been a smash hit--it surpasses anything Alfred Hitchcock has filmed.  (It did get some awards in Britain when it was shown there on TV back in 1992.)  The acting throughout is excellent.  Kitchen has the same mannerisms and low key acting that make him such a compelling Foyle-though of course he is playing a role which is almost the polar opposite in terms of character.  Catz is equally accomplished, and one has a foretaste of her excellent acting as Louisa Glasson in Doc Martin.  Her career after this movie and until Doc Martin consisted mainly of being a police officer in a series of detective serials, a few episodes of ""The Bill"" and ""The Vice"" and being the co-star police detective in a three season program ""Murder in Suburbia"" all well known in Britain but not familiar to most American audiences.  I'm surprised that her performance in ""The Guilty"" didn't turn her into an international star overnight.

One reviewer disliked it because Michael Kitchen's moral character was so different than in Foyle's War.  Yes, it is, but to me it only shows what a versatile actor he is.  I don't think that should be held against the movie.  A couple of others have commented on the unusual number of coincidences necessary to drive the plot forward.  I agree, and more than once I muttered that only if one of the characters had spoken up about what they knew, the situation might have turned out for the better.  But, I don't think of this as a defect-it simply allowed the complexity of thoughts and motives of the leading characters to be fully developed.

I'd give ""The Guilty"" twenty stars if possible.  It is a superb film.",1310515200,2,2512,4.61936936936937
