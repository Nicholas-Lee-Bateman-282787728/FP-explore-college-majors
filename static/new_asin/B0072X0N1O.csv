5053138,5,B0072X0N1O,My children love to learn and this is a great way to help them. One of my kids is autistic and she has started singing along with the songs. My children range from 2-5 and they have learned so much. I love it.,1408924800,6,209,3.883720930232558
5053139,5,B0072X0N1O,Love this series! Love the research put into the next stages of Your Baby Can Read. This series along with Your Baby Can Discover will definitely allow children to learn without even realizing it. I encourage all parents to use these series to teach babies at a young age so that they CAN READ!,1386115200,5,294,4.462962962962963
5053140,5,B0072X0N1O,"My son's God Father bought Your Baby Can Read (with the books and flash cards) for my son for his First birthday and the set came with Your Child Can Read. Since then my son has been diagnosed Non-Verbal Autistic. But the more he watches the entire DVD series the more words he learns, the more he says and he's reading those words as he's seeing them!! Some thing Dr's told us he would never be able to do!!! He's 3 now.",1386028800,22,421,4.146341463414634
5053141,3,B0072X0N1O,"it was for children that's older I didn't know that when I order it, was looking for the one that's for younger
kids with the flash cards included is what i'm interested in next.",1383264000,4,178,4.264705882352941
5053142,5,B0072X0N1O,"I use the program ""Your Baby Can Read"" for my granddaughter.  At age four, she is reading on a third grade level. So I decided to try Your Child Can Read...very impressed. I recommend this product for children eight months to five years of age.",1373673600,26,244,4.4222222222222225
5053143,1,B0072X0N1O,"I ordered this item, and discovered that it is a fake.  Not the real deal, but a low quality rip off. I just ordered the real thing from yourbabycanread.com for less money.",1366675200,19,172,4.375
8509064,4,B0072X0N1O,"Not as good as the original.  My first child was picking out the right words on the cards before she could speak.  No one believed us so we had to video it.  My second child read at 1 year, also my fourth.  My third child liked it until age 1 and lost interest quickly, but he is only interested in numbers.",1455753600,3,307,3.9836065573770494
8509065,5,B0072X0N1O,Now i don't know if this is the original program. I bought this for my twins when they were young. I started them on this when the were just 3 months by the time they were 2 years old they were able to recognize over 200 words. My children are now in kindergarten and is advance compare to other children.,1453161600,,305,4.1
8509066,5,B0072X0N1O,"I had actually purchased both this and the Baby Can Read set directly from the Titzer website, but writing this review after seeing the ""low stars"" on it.  In short, these do work.  You have to read the ""low star"" comments probably in context.  The Baby Can Read is the FIRST set to start with, probably followed by the Child Can Discover (you can read my comments on that one as well), then THIS set.  If your child is only two, the Baby Can Read is the ONLY one to start with - since this one is much faster paced and geared towards age three+.  Yes, I said age TWO.  My sons both watched these series since about 1 1/2, and even when they couldn't talk, I learned after-the-fact that they were absorbing everything in..  The trick was (a) don't push, and (b) remember that the attention spans start really small and very very slowly increase over time.  Again, all I can say is buy the set and have a little faith, patience, and love - but if you don't have all three, it ain't gonna work..",1451260800,5,993,4.2727272727272725
8509067,1,B0072X0N1O,My 3 year old won't pay attention to this DVD for more than 2 minutes. So Boring. I don't know if the original is better but this set is absolutely not worth it.,1440547200,,161,3.909090909090909
8509068,5,B0072X0N1O,Love this set,1439510400,,13,3.6666666666666665
8509069,3,B0072X0N1O,Yes it was very good that I could order off this site and not search the world for this product thank you!,1435708800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8509070,4,B0072X0N1O,pretty good.,1428192000,,12,5.5
8509071,5,B0072X0N1O,"It's too bad the company that made this product went out of business because of a lot of ignorant skeptics out there. I put my daughter on this program when she was just four months old. It's effective, interactive, entertaining, and stimulating. My daughter learned how to read all the words on the DVDs by 3. I also used phonics easy reader books and read-along DVDs and karaoke. Her IQ score for literacy is 148. She's now at a school for gifted kids. My niece also used this program and she started reading before she could talk. You'd show her the word and she'd point to it. I couldn't believe it!!!",1420416000,13,605,4.45945945945946
8509072,4,B0072X0N1O,Time will tell. The DVDs themselves were in good shape but the covers were chipped. Preferred getting these used; not sure of their value for my six year old who is behind in his reading skills. The material presentation seemed dated and simplistic... but I suppose there is some science behind this approach.,1417996800,2,309,4.849056603773585
