8188039,1,B000P0J0GU,"First off i want to mention that i have about 250 to 300 NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC episodes on DVD. Most of the nature shows are fantastic. But, SECRET YELLOWSTONE falls short. I watched this late at night after a busy day at work and then a busy evening with my three young boys. I was looking forward to a classic nature show about Yosemiti. Nope, not with this show. Instead, i was berated and harrassed about GLOBAL WARMING for 46 minutes. No less than 7 times did they mention GLOBAL WARMING. I lost count how many times they used the words CLIMATE CHANGE. So, because of GLOBAL WARMING those 3000 year old trees may die because of lack of water caused by GLOBAL WARMING. I have had it with this mularky. We just had the coldest winter in decades. This was a bait and switch. I thought i was purchasing a nature show not a political ad.",1394582400,3,835,4.358974358974359
8188040,3,B000P0J0GU,"This DVD stays at the similar style as Secret Yellowstone by NG. It is not for people who want to get an overview of this park. It is just focused on some special topics, climbing El Capitan, climbing Half Dome, global warming and the Giant Sequoia.

The part of Climbing El Capitan is quite an eye-opener for me, especially the King Swing. It is beyond my original imagination. For people who never have an experience of rock climbing like me, it is very exciting to see this.

The shooting quality is good as most films by NG. The animation is helpful to explain the science and geology.

Overall, this film is suitable for people who want to know something not commonly seen in Yosemite.",1202860800,3,690,4.548387096774194
8188041,3,B000P0J0GU,"Although this video is more than the already described climb of El Capitan, it is little more than another global warming warning and message that, if not already heeded, will do little to motivate your concern.  Though perhaps true, I was more than a little disappointed that so much energy was spent to build such an air of doom, rather than share the often missed ""secrets"" that exist in such a miraculous place as Yosemite.

The brief mention of ""Shattered Air"" was a little open ended, and I do recommend that you read the story of that day, and of the incredibly powerful effects of changing weather within the park before you visit.  You most surely need to inform yourself before venturing out on the seemingly harmless trails.

Take it from me.  I've been on top of Half Dome when a lightning storm hit(on my first trip at age 12, none the less!), and have hid below the lightning rods under shelves of slippery granite hoping it would pass.  It will make you grateful to return, and will surely change your plans in the future.  That is, should you plan to make a second trip.  I did make more than a dozen trips up that rock, including the last which involved a wildfire below Half Dome, and being forced down the trails in the dark to avoid harm.  Out of all of my experiences, one thing is sure.  I wouldn't trade any of my adventures for a warm bed.

Lightning, fire, & wind.  This video gives snippets of these forces, as well as rock slides (that occur often throughout the park), but in the end falls short of offering much more than has been seen before, and in a less fulfilling way.  Some nice aerial shots and time lapse, but very little.  Overall, this video is very disappointing when considering that it is a National Geographic production.

For a more balanced look at Yosemite I recommend:

Spirit of Yosemite
Yosemite: The Seasons; Echoes of Tenaya
Return to Balance: A Climber's Journey

My family began visiting Yosemite in 1946, and we still make several visits to the park, both high and low, many times each year.  Each time we leave, it is more difficult to say goodbye.

I, for one, think the secrets need to remain secrets.  Mysteries are to be sought in person, and not on video.  I hope to write a book about my adventures one day should time allow.  I will, however, faithfully keep the secrets I know to myself.  I have only shared what I have found with family and my very best, like minded friends.  Still, I draw no maps, and I give no directions.  I just lead the way.
