2168190,5,B00064VQXA,"Although the original still firmly stands superior, CSI Miami is nevertheless, a good show that is easy to just sit, watch, and get pulled into.  It's ""tense, gripping, exciting drama"" as I like to jikingly call, but it's not that far from the truth.  Although the characters can sometimes be a little annoying, it really depends on what you like.  If you like Caruso's cheesy maneurisms, or Emily Proctor's constant cheerfulness, it probably won't bother you and will keep you watching.  These more positive and sunny characters (probably influenced by the city itself) are responsible for making Miami more enjoyable than New York, but also puts it behind Vegas.  These are the season two episodes.

Blood Brothers: A model is the fatal victim of a hit and run, Horatio and Yelina examine their feelings for eachother.

Dead Zone: A man is discovered harpooned while searching for sunken treasure, and the death could be financially motivated.

Hard Time: A woman lured to a condo is found beaten to death, which leads Horatio to a Georgia prison.

Death Grip: A teen tennis star is kidnapped from her bedroom.  Jeff Corwin guest stars

The Best Defense: Owners of a bar are shot dead by a masked gunman.  Also, Calleigh's dad asks for her help with a murder case.

Hurricane Anthony: Trying to escape the fury of a hurricane, a man hits and kills another after being blinded by the storm.  Other deaths are also investigated after the hurricane hits.

Grand Prix: Pit crewman is burned to death in a Miami race, which brings the team into the strange world of racing.

Big Brother: Horatio becomes driven to find his brother Ray's killer, and discovers a niece he never he had.

Bait: After a woman is attacked and killed by a shark, the case becomes strange after it is discovered she was shot first.

Extreme: A young woman is found thrown over the railing of a parking garage, but it is discovered she was already dead.

Complications: A man is discovered hanging in his two-story condo, but the evidence points to murder, and that the killer had a motive.

Witness to Murder: A man carrying $2 million is murdered after he confronts a man who hit his car.  Delko and Speedle investigate the death of a girl killed at a rest stop

Slow Burn: A fire traps Delko and Alexx who are investigating a murder and find another body while trapped.

Stalkerazzi: A photographer is found murdered in his car which leads to 2 movie stars.

Invasion: A surf champion is found murdered which unveils a very troubled family and a person with a good motive for the death

Money for Nothing: An armored truck is robbed which leads to two deaths and an investigation of what happened to the real money.

Wannabe: A wannabe CSI is murdered when he is supposed to testify for the murder of a man stabbed with a butter knife

Deadline: Two young reporters are murdered which leads the CSI team to believe that a survivor's original story was false.

The Oath: A police officer's death proves to be murder and that it wasn't a random crime.

Not Landing: A small plane crashes and kills the pilot.  After an investigation however, evidence shows the pilot died before the crash, which puts Horatio on dangerous ground.

Rap Sheet: A security guard is killed at a rap concert, while a supposedly dead woman wakes up in the morgue.

Mia/Nyc: A young girl finds both her parents murdered which leads Horatio to New York, where he meets the CSI New York team.

Innocent: An adult film actress is murdered and the investigation goes arwy with the loss of a crucial piece of evidence.",1105142400,46,3562,4.6843800322061195

2168304,4,B00064VQXA,"I recently finished season 2 and began season 3 with optimistic hopes.  I started watching CSI Miami with some trepidation because
I feel that while the stories  are very good, the cast is weak compared with the other two CSI series.  However, season two picked
up the pace a  bit, with a splendid Tidal Wave sequence and the  rapid maturing of David  Caruso as a great boss, much in the
Jethro Gibbs mold.  The other cast are adequate and fit in relatively well though I am not particularly endeared to the  blondie dame.
To be fair I do not like blonds, especially bleached blonds; I think they are fake, phoney, frauds but she has improved somewhat
from season one and I will give her a chance to impress me in the future (I have all 10 seasons on DVD from Amazon) and there
are a couple of supporting cast members that I like including the chunky sheriff (or detective?) who spends a lot of time with the boys.
Lots of good action, splendid photography and shoot-them-out stuff plus some gooey gore to add spice.  Deko is ok, I guess, but
I would like to see more humor in the show much like in the NCIS series.  Some mush might help and some personal stories as
well.  There does seem to be a bit of friction between Horatio and his sister-in-law and her rather creepy boyfriend.  Horatio's
brother died some years back and I think Horatio is a bit jealous of his bother's wife running around with this other detective.
He has admitted that he wanted to marry her before his bother landed her.  I don't know how this story is going to end if ever;
he certainly does not like her boyfriend.  He does look cool in his shades and has very compassionate feelings for the victims of
the visious thugs  that seem to be all over Miami.  Especially for children.
  I just started season 3 and there is a new investigator added to the group and I think he is going to  be excellent.  Throughout
season 2, however, are quite a number of exciting stories for those who like these types of programs.  It is well worth the cost;
I give it 4 stars though I think five stars could also be given.  Only the weak cast keeps it down a bit in my view; But David Caruso
is outstanding, as well as the outstanding production values.
  Note to BONES producers: put Bones back in the field with Booth; that is what I think most Bones fans want.  Scrap that moron
Abrury or what ever his name is.  Get back to the original idea of the series that made it so popular.  PLEASE!!
  Enjoy!

2168307,3,B00064VQXA,"The second season of CSI: Miami continues with pretty much the same characters from the first season, and I was glad to see more episodes explore the background of who Horatio's brother was and the people affected, as well as looking a little more into background into the personal lives of some of the other characters (something that seemed to be lacking in the first season.) As far as the investigations there are still plenty of grizzly crimes taking place across south Florida, and while some of the episodes can be fairly formulaic, there were some clever spins this season - notably the interaction with the CSI: NY episode, which was a clever cross-over (but seemed like it missed a ""NYPD Blue"" reference, unless I just didn't catch it.)

The one character I don't get, though, is the Tim Speedle investigator, who just seems perpetually bored and sardonic, and even with brief windows into his character, such as the one with the kid with ambitions of being a future CSI agent, Speedle just seems tired, frustrated and annoyed with him, and everyone else for that matter (in a strange way, he reminds me of a young Burt Young, with the grizzled, doughy guy look). Of everyone in the series he just seems like the most disinterested one. The rest of the characters are lively and believable though, but maybe it's just me. I just don't get his character.

Another observation is that Horatio Caine seems to remind me more and more of Lt. Martin Castillo from Miami Vice, namely in his unshakable demeanor and how nothing really seems to rattle him, and even when provoked by a criminal or a fiesy IA officer he's never really shaken. With his cold, silent analysis and bad posture, there's a lot of Castillo being channeled there, and that's a good thing. I'm curious to see more of his background and the series progresses.

The second season of CSI: Miami is decent, and while there are some duds the season was a pretty good one.",1418860800,2,1941,4.686217008797654

2168361,5,B00064VQXA,"In the second season of CSI Miami, the series continued to embark on inventing new and creative ways for people to die. The cinematography and geography combine to give CSI Miami a very unique Miami feel. This unique look is almost as big a part of the show as the crimes that each episode revolves around. A key subtlety of this particular set of DVD's is that in the episode commentaries, the writers and producers are all business in explaining how they develop some of the cinematography. It was very refreshing, considering that most commentaries devolve into silliness among actors, though it might've been nice to have David Caruso on commentary. Every episode has a unique feel and grips the viewer from beginning to end.",1339977600,3,729,4.84

2168366,5,B00064VQXA,"Although I despise this show I bought this collection because it happened to feature both Deanna Wright (Kay Bennett) and Molly Stanton (Charity, Evil Charity, Zombie Charity...) from the long canceled daytime drama Passions in separate episodes, 'Innocent' and 'The Oath' respectively. Both women had left the soap by the time this aired. Deanna plays a young porn star (but not just any kind of porn star--as always in these asinine programs every kind of porn turns out to be, secretly, either kiddie porn, or monkey porn, or snuff films or whatever other damn thing the holy rollers who write this stuff can come up with) who gets strangled to death by a frazzled masturbator. (Aren't they all?) Interestingly, despite this or her role as Kay, someone about as far from Godly as you can get, Wright was supposedly a devout Christian who went on, I understand, to become a wife and stay at home mommy and Sunday school teacher. (This Christian devotion was allegedly why she left Passions, refusing to perform in scenes she felt revealed too much nudity or were too highly sexual.) Unfortunately she has a minimum of screen time in the episode, sexual or otherwise, and is pretty much lost in the morass of its painfully self righteous, ham acted morality crusade. Perhaps, as a Christian, this is how she rationalized her appearance in the role: as a cautionary tale for other, less devout girls. For her part Ms. Stanton plays a bubblegum chewing street prostitute who gets mixed up in the shooting of a cop. Sexy, but again, her actual screen time is fairly limited. Stanton went on to star in the WB sitcom 'Twins', where she worked with Sara Gilbert, Melanie Griffith, and Mark Linn-Baker. I'm giving C.S.I. Miami, at least this season of it, five stars for its incalculable Passions/Deanna/Molly value, but also to acknowledge, with grudging respect, how awful, nearly execrable, television can be in the proper hands. I think it's a real historical treasure.",1305676800,,1968,4.912912912912913

Horatio Cain is a lead investigator for the CSI:Miami team he's cool and always has a good attitude about everything.  Plus as I mentioned He's cool.  It's actually kind of funny because just about every episode he says pun or something like that that's funny.

This show is full of action and crime some of the episodes go over the top with trying to make it real but I think they did a good job of this season way better than the first.

This is an excellent show with a very good director as well.",1277510400,2,594,4.175438596491228

2168377,4,B00064VQXA,"David Caruso's overacting aside, season 2 of CSI: Miami was pretty decent. The cases and the evidence were still in the realm of real possibility, even if Horatio Caine's omniscience gets a little irritating after a while. Emily Proctor and Adam Rodriguez are good for some lighter moments, which are desperately needed to balance out the black hole that is Caruso's ultra-serious acting.

The introduction of several continuing plotlines, most of which revolve around Horatio's dead brother, adds a nice undertone that give a story that carries throughout the show, which is much more episode-based than its predecessor.",1224547200,,621,5.336734693877551

This brand of drama-meets-beach combined with clever investigative twists, and the latest technology (kudos to Chai Fong!), combined with the ""no deals"" boss at the top makes this series eerily like a 21st century Hawaii-Five-O!

That is a delicate balance difficult to pull off, especially in one hour episodes, but he accomplishes it with aplomb.  I recommend this series to anyone interested in the genre.

2168386,2,B00064VQXA,"The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence.

2168387,4,B00064VQXA,"There could never be an equal show to CSI in Las Vegas.  The acting is good (if not a bit corny on David Caruso's part), and the storylines are also quite good, but the trouble with sequels is that there is something that can never be replicated.  This is one of those incidents.  Also, one thing I don't like about this series, is that there is so much orange.  The sky and scenes all have orange tinges to them.  It's not entirely distracting, but it's somewhat irritating.  Overall I gave it 4 stars for effort, but it lost a star due to it's failure to reach the same heights as CSI the original.",1125619200,3,600,4.265486725663717
2168388,4,B00064VQXA,"The thing that strikes me the most about the CSI series' is that each one has a distinctly different feel to it.  CSI is more technical and intellectual.  CSI Miami is sexy and fast.  CSI NYC is gritty and methodical.  The differences keep them all fresh.  They also set themselves up for different tastes.

Personally, I enjoy CSI the most.  CSI Miami, in my opinion, has two flaws.

First, they seem to try too hard to be sexy.  I watch these shows for the drama and suspense - not the hot chicks.  Now I'll be the first to admit that I don't mind gazing at a firm female form but there is a time and place for everything.  I'd rather see more crime solving here - I'll tune to IFC to get my fill of T&A.

Second, David Caruso spent way too much time in the William Shatner school of over acting.  Just watching him remove his sunglasses can be mind numbing.  I almost avoided this series from the start when I saw that he was the lead but I'm glad I overlooked the casting mistake.  But while his physical actions and speech patterns annoy me, they aren't enough to ruin the show.  I just keep hoping to see a gator snag him and pull him into the everglades.

Despite those 2 flaws I do thoroughly enjoy this series and so far I think season 2 is my favorite.  While still not as good as CSI, I think its well worth the money.

Buy this if you like CSI and try to overlook Caruso.",1117238400,24,1383,4.170454545454546
2168389,5,B00064VQXA,"I never watched this show on TV, but I happened to get the dvd's for the first and second season for CSI Miami.  NOW I cant wait for the shows...I watched them all in a few days time.  They are very addicting and make science geeks look cool for once.  I am really impressed with Rory Cochrane (Tim Speedle on the show).  To me, he does the best performance.  I was surprised to see Kim Delaney's character taken out so quickly but it didn't affect the fluidity of the show either.

I strongly suggest getting this show.  It's better than tv since you don't get the commercial interruptions.",1116288000,28,591,4.416666666666667

I was actually hopeing to preorder season 3 when I came across this aweful review about how the show is no good. This show is great you get real addicted to it. Yes, Horacio Caine is star struck but come on its a TV show get over it the characters all have their own personality. I honestly think this show is awesome!! Vegas is awesome too just in it's own way... Either one is worth the money... hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!

2168392,1,B00064VQXA,"Honestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I'm surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it.

The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there's a V.I.P suspect with a ""history"" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he's involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it's not him. And Calleigh gets ""evidence"" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge ""clues"" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that's unlikely? Exactly my point.

In short, I wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else. Watch this show if you're REALLY bored, with nothing else to do and no better use of your time. If you want real Crime Scene Investigation, watch the original C.S.I, Las Vegas. That's the best C.S.I....period.",1113177600,5,1878,4.670694864048339
