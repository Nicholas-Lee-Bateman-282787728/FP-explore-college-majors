3151964,2,B00164SW9K,"Although in the past I have become a big fan of some of the people involved with this film, I have to say it was a total dud. I was so excited but after watching it, I would probably list it on my top ten worst movies ever list. It was pointless. Although I do love Brandon Dicamillo's imprompt-to work, and usually things that Raab is in as well, this was definately a let down.",1216166400,,379,4.066666666666666
3151965,5,B00164SW9K,"When you start with the 30 minute short you don't really know what to expect. I found it very entertaining but not what I was accustom to. Then I went to the special features... (Which last much longer then the actual short) and they were exactly what every fan remembers. Random skits cut and chopped together for ultimate laughs. I watched the whole DVD 3 times the first night just because you miss so much when they get moving. Chris Raab puts together a hell of a DVD. You get the short which is beatifully filmed, the sketches that everyone rememebers and then about 1/2 an hour of just random clips of Brandon talking in front of the camera (Which I would pay to have formated on CD so I could just listen to over and over again) ..... Overall excellent cheap buy!!!",1214265600,3,773,4.4125874125874125

8260870,5,B00164SW9K,"I loved it, it was very entertaining. I just wish it was longer. It's only about 30 minutes long, but includes extra stuff, Hotdog Diaries, deleted scenes, etc.. I would also recommend Borrowed Happiness.",1493078400,,204,5.029411764705882
8260871,4,B00164SW9K,"Funny, but really weird also!!! Wasn't at all what I was expecting... but doesn't surprise me coming from the twisted minds of Dico and Raab. A must for any CKY/Jackass/Bam collecter anyway. If you don't like that stuff, probably don't bother!",1412467200,,243,4.951219512195122
8260872,1,B00164SW9K,We love the Jackass boys but this movie was ridiculous. It was extremely short and had no point at all,1390521600,,102,4.15
8260873,5,B00164SW9K,"Simply put (mostly because I don't review movies often), if you're looking for an obscure romp in hilarity from Chris Raab, Brandon DiCamillo, Rake Yohn, and others, then get this. If you enjoyed Haggard, you should dig this.",1354665600,,225,4.947368421052632
8260874,1,B00164SW9K,"I love, LOVE Brandon ""Dico"" DiCamillo.  I love all things CKY.  Raab isn't my favorite, but he has his moments.  So then why does this movie eminate the odour of failure and decay?  I was all psyched to watch this, and when it finally came in the mail I ran straight from the mail box to the DVD player.  And there the dream died.  I could go on and on about this aspect of the story, or that direction, but the simple truth is this just isn't very funny.  In fact, it kind of sucks.  Oh well.",1272844800,,493,4.010309278350515
8260875,3,B00164SW9K,"Hotdog Casserole is a little short. I didn't really get the point of the movie, probably because it only lasts around 30mins. But the extra's are fantastic. All in all, im glad i bought it.",1248307200,2,189,4.428571428571429
8260876,4,B00164SW9K,"The filming was excellent but I wasn't crazy about the movie.  Raab is barely in the actual film, if at all.  I would have preferred Brandon and Raab just being themselves.  Raab should have included a entire extra just on Key Key.  It was a ok story line though, but seemed to get cut off before any of it came to an end.  If you're a fan of Raab buy it just to support him.  Its worth the [...] bucks.",1245974400,,403,3.975
8260877,1,B00164SW9K,"I am a huge fan of the entire CKY, Jackass, Viva La Bam. etc series and when I came across an opportunity to see Raab in his own movie I was pumped. I could barely stand to finish the 30 minute short feature which is neither funny nor does it have a plot what so ever. The extras were slightly humorous but that could have been the slight buzz of alcohol searching for a laugh. I am deeply disappointed in the purchase and will never watch it again.",1233014400,2,449,4.113636363636363
8260878,5,B00164SW9K,"Like others... I had no idea what to expect from this movie. Bought to support my friends, but had no expectations. However, I was actually very impressed with the balance of humor and storytelling. There was enough ""classic Raab"" and Bran to keep Jackass fans laughing at both the moments of comic relief and the DVD's extras. But there was also some great acting and a quick-moving plot to almost make you forget you're watching a movie written by a guy who once took a crap on a restaurant window. When it ended, I wished there was another 20 minutes or so and thought it could have been developed a little more because I was actually engrossed in the characters and their plight, but that is my only criticism. Overall, an excellent bargain buy for both diehard Raab fans and for those interested in a good indie flick.",1231372800,4,823,4.5675675675675675
