796133,1,6304154151,"Normally, watching Doctor Who, you have to deal with poor special effects.  But they're never as bad, however, as they are in this story.  The shots of the giant squid for which this story is named are so bad that I could  not believe the characters truly thought it was even there.
Besides  that, the story is an atrocity which almost (but not quite) saves a star  for the wit and acting of Tom Baker.  Nobody else in the story even shows  up in this department.  A further disappointment is that the author of the  story, Robert Holms, is arguably the finest writer the series has had.  I  really have a hard time believing he actually wrote this story.
If you  are watching the Key to Time season, I'll just say that the squid is the  5th segment so you can skip watching this one (even though you would have  figured THAT out before the first episode was over).
This is probably  the worst Tom Baker story of all.",919728000,,917,4.34319526627219

What also made it cool was that I recognized the Neil McCarthy (character Thawn) from his role as Calibos from Clash of the Titans, one of my favorite movies as a child.

796233,5,6304154151,"I can't believe I used to watch such camp. But of course, it was because the weirdness of Tom Baker that made him the most popular Dr. Who to me (David Tennant coming in second).

The dude at the controls of the processing plant flipping switches in no particular order, must have been SOP in TV shows and movies when an actor was placed in front of a myriad of switches. ""Just flip a few switches here and a few switches there. Make it look as if you know what you're doing"" - must have been the direction given to the actor(s) at a time when computers weren't readily available (or understood) in Hollywood or BBC TV series. Bottom of the barrel ""Low Tech""

Those green ""Swampies"" doing their uncoordinated dance and chanting to Kroll; once again proves that ""White Men Can't Dance"" (he said tongue-in-cheek). I was waiting for Rick James to pop out of the swamp with a rousing ""She's Supah Freekaaay!""  The guns that Rohm-Dutt supplied to the Swampies looked like over-sized blow dryers used on ""Afro's.""  I still enjoy watching the old series with Tom Baker (love Romana).

796235,4,6304154151,"I just want to throw up a warning to those that may already own some Doctor Who DVDs, I'm sure most people interested in this DVD in the first place are big Doctor Who fans anyway, but if not then be careful when buying this DVD! (Maybe you are buying as a gift?)I am fairly certain this is a single ""episode"" DVD release from the originally 6 part ""Key to Time"" Tom Baker set, (look that up by itself for details). You really need all 6 episodes together to get the full picture (full show is a 26 show run). So this is a good DVD to own especially if you want to buy ""Key to Time"" one at a time; BUT only if you do not have the ""Key to Time"" set already, just a warning to those who may mistakenly buy the same set twice. This is however - from the looks of it, (still a pre-release as I write this), a new version with extra special features and commentary from the originally release ""Key to Time"" version; they are also releasing a new ""key to Time"" set though with all 6 DVDs having the extra love and care added. (This disc will be in that set I assume). So if you really want this disc alone go ahead, but I would suggest either the OLD ""Key to Time"" set which will be getting cheaper, or go all out and get the new set when it's released around the time of this individual DVD.",1234828800,,1286,4.02734375
796236,5,6304154151,"Well, with ""The Power of Kroll"" the Doctor and Romana's quest for the Key to Time segments progresses apace, although some might say this storyline is a step backwards for ""Doctor Who"" as a whole. Okay, well, it's not perfect, but in some ways it's one of the stronger stories in the Key to Time sequence, and typifies much of what I like in this show.

First off, to address the giant octopus in the room, the special effects used to represent Kroll are, well, less than convincing, true. That said, it's a bit beyond me why this particular effect draws so much flak, when the show as a whole has never been famous for dazzling effects.  Clearly the folks responsible for this one got a bit ambitious, sure; still, the Kroll model itself is pretty good, it just doesn't integrate well with the rest of the scene. Today, CGI would fix that right away, of course, but in 1978 that option wasn't available. So it goes, but to blame  ""Power of Kroll"" for the fact that SFX has progressed way beyond it seems a bit unfair.

But why do we really watch ""Doctor Who"" anyway? For imaginative, thought-provoking, and interesting science fiction stories that are also extremely fun and entertaining, that's what--and ""The Power of Kroll"" fits this bill nicely. First of all, it demonstrates that key ""Doctor Who"" strength of suggesting an entire complex environment with historical and cultural depth mainly through deftly crafted dialogue. You get a very real sense of a vast span of different human colonies in space complete with interstellar corporations, resistance movements (""The Sons of Earth"") and displaced natives with their own mythologies. Second of all, a key theme running throughout the whole series is very much integral to the plot here, that of science vs. superstition (to put it rather bluntly)--is Kroll a great god demanding sacrifice, or just a big hungry animal? This contrast in worldviews is not just handled through juxtaposing the technologically backwards culture of the Swampies (clearly modeled somewhat on Native Americans and Pacific Islanders) with the mechanistic civilization of the humans, though, but also explored within Swampie culture itself, as tensions increase between the tribe's high priest Ranquin, who can somehow manage to justify any act by Kroll according to his theology, and the younger Swampies who come to increasingly doubt Kroll's divinity and keep asking naggingly inconvenient empirical questions. Indeed, another key strength of this storyline is its underlying moral focus on the problems and issues of colonialism and imperialism in a balanced manner that is insistently ethical without being cloyingly preachy.

Finally, this storyline succeeds admirably as a ""Key to Time"" installment in ways that the prior two didn't. In both ""Stones of Blood"" and ""Androids of Tara"" the whole Key to Time element seemed extraneous, tacked on at the very end or else the very beginning almost as an afterthought. Here, though, it's an integral part of the story, responsible indirectly for the presence of the human colonists and directly for the power of Kroll, and finding it coincides neatly and seamlessly with the climax of the tale.

All of this sounds pretty heavy, but it's great fun, too, with cheesy human sacrifice scenes straight from B movies and paranoid, prejudiced refinery directors you love to hate. Tom Baker is in top form as the Doctor, full of delightfully witty lines (some a bit more sarcastic than usual) and the usual refined silliness, and Mary Tamm has finally hit her pace well as Romana with a few good one-liners of her own (what, are all Time Lords insufferable smart-alecks?). The location shots are fine, too, and it's good to see we've finally moved beyond the gravel pit in this season. All in all, then, this is a very well-written and enjoyable ""Doctor Who"" adventure, excelling where the show usually does well while dropping the ball where the show usually and understandably stumbles.

P.S. Since ""The Power of Kroll"" is the fifth storyline in the six-part ""Key to Time"" saga of the sixteenth season, this DVD is also included with five other DVDs in a box set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Key-to-Time-Collection/dp/B000067FPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Key to Time Collection</a>, so unless you have a particular interest just in this one storyline, that may be the better option both in terms of economics and convenience.",1179360000,4,4484,5.1595598349381016

""SH. Maybe it's saving you for pudding!""  I love that quip to the megalomaniacal Thawn after Thawn reasons that if the squid wanted to attack them, it would have done so already.
Here's another one, and perhaps my all-time favorite:  ""If they catch us loitering in here... they'll put two and two together...""  Then he notices Thawn had snuck up behind him, without missing a breath, (to Thawn) ""You are putting two and two together I can tell by the expression on your face you're putting two and two together...""

796240,2,6304154151,"This really is something of a disaster, and is by far the worst story in the Key to Time Series. Green coloured men running around, random tentacles grabbing various cast members - it's all a bit duff. The story tries to put forward a commentary on the bad things that happen when a country/place is colonized and it's original inhabitants (read: native-americans in this story) are ousted. Problem is, it just doesn't work due to deficiencies in script, effects, acting (swampies don't act well), you name it.
Overall, it was a poor choice for the penultimate key to time story, and you can't help but wonder whether, had they swapped the stones of blood and kroll around, it wouldn't have been so bad.",1039046400,4,703,4.723577235772358
796241,3,6304154151,"I'm going to admit to something that may not make me very popular in Doctor Who circles.  But here goes anyway.  I like THE POWER OF KROLL.  Go ahead; call me a sick man, a twisted fan, a Swampie-Lover and a reject from the Sons Of Earth.  I don't care what you think.  Yes, KROLL may be a outrageously silly adventure featuring some of the most awful special effects imaginable, but it's a story that I have fond memories of.  The biggest flaw, and I mean this in all seriousness, is that Kroll completely fails to breathe fire, stomp through downtown Tokyo, or fire laser beams out of his eyes.  If only he had, we would have been looking at a near perfect adventure.
Okay, I don't know how anyone on the production team ever thought that they could possibly get away with attempting to realize a sea-monster that's supposed to about a mile across.  Doctor Who could rarely even get human-sized creatures looking right, and the result that appears onscreen here is both far better and far far worse than one would expect.  Better, because the Kroll monster itself actually looks quite alien and strange.  Worse, because whenever this surprisingly good alien creature has to interact with the rest of the story, it does so on the wrong side of a horribly obvious special effect line.  The DVD production notes go into detail about what went wrong on the production side, but the long and short of it is that it looks absolutely terrible.  It's a pity they didn't realize how flimsy and shoddy the creature effects would being and go completely over to the side of making this a comedy.  One imagines that if the production team had tried this a season later, the monster and the Swampies makeup would have looked even more pathetic, but would have been infinitely more entertaining.
Still, while the Kroll monster is a particularly poor effect, one can never watch Doctor Who for its production values.  What I like about this one is it's effective use of the Base Under Siege mentality.  When I first saw this story, I was a young fanbaby and had no idea that this sort of thing was supposedly a worn-out Doctor Who clich&eacute;.  I liked it then, and that enjoyment has stayed with me.  The few sets and small cast help convey the feeling of claustrophobia.  KROLL is just a pure adventure.  Running around, avoiding the giant monster, getting captured by aliens, escaping from aliens, etc.  It's just simple fun.  The only downside to this sort of silly/fun adventure is that Kroll doesn't eat nearly as many innocent bystanders as he could have.  Oh well.
POWER OF KROLL works well as a simple children's adventure.  Sure, some aspects of the plot carry all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, but one shouldn't really expect subtlety in a television program featuring a gigantic, evil, angry squid as the main villain.  KROLL appealed to the part of me that enjoys Godzilla films.  So what if I'm laughing at it rather than with it?  At least I'm laughing.
The DVD commentary lacks the behind the scenes know-how that had been displayed on other discs.  Tom Baker and John Leeson don't really remember much about anything to do with POWER OF KROLL, though to their credit they do manage to make an amusing performance.  I enjoyed listening to them once, but I doubt that I'd go out of my way to listen again.  It's a pity that there are no production staff members on this commentary track; perhaps they could have jogged the actors' memories.  Still, even without any actual recollections of the story, Tom Baker manages to bring a laugh, although he did seem to get a little too excited during each of Kroll's onscreen appearances.
THE POWER OF KROLL is a story about a giant squid that made it big and decided to eat a lot of people.  Treat it like a cheap monster flick and you can have a fun time with this one.  This is pure silly entertainment, and while Doctor Who on TV could often do far more, it's important to consider that entertainment was one of its most important priorities.  But just remember what it says on that box.  If you know the adventure is featuring a giant, enraged octopus and you go in expecting a detailed, textural, tear-jerking story about Kroll seeking therapy and anger-management classes, then I'm afraid that you're going to be profoundly disappointed.  Just break out the popcorn, take a drink every time Kroll eats somebody, and you'll be fine, just fine.",1038873600,11,4397,4.658884565499352
796342,5,6304154151,"Power of Kroll, Horns of Nimon, and Meglos...  The most underrated shows in Dr. Who.  I am reviewing the three of them here as Meglos and Nimon aren't on DVD -or!!- VHS.  Sure, the special effects are paper mashe' monsters that stand still for five minutes doing nothing, but if one had half an imagination one could suspend thier disbelief.  Dr. Who is not to be watched as a Box Office movie or a deep emotional TV series with heavy serious issues. No, these stories are simply fun to watch. And the stories interesting because they are unique and sometimes surreal.  And the enjoyment they bring is the bottom line, isn't it...
Think of the sets as a play.  That is how this is done.  The opratic costume designs of Nimon and Meglos.  Ignor the fact that Kroll looks like a paper mashe'.  If you see a play the sets aren't there to be 'realistic' they are there as a simbol of what they represent.  I think the monster is quiet good in Kroll if you ignor the fact that special effects are better now than then. People are too spoiled by special effects in shows that I find pale in comparison to Dr. Who as far a story and characters.  Star Trek Next Gen, Farscape, Lexx, all a bunch of over-glorified soap opra filler with mush and sex and special FX.
Dr. Who, an entertaining story with beautiful sets, even if they aren't 'realistic' or 'believable'.  Surreal is what outer space is all about.
And on a final note:  PLEASE RELEASE MEGLOS AND HORNS OF NIMON ON DVD(or at the very least VHS.) Tom Baker, Lalla Ward, and K-9(John Leason) are in both of them.  Thank you!",1023494400,8,1573,4.416666666666667
796343,4,6304154151,"This story is from the age when the Tom Baker era was going downhill, but I'd say it's the best I've seen of the Key to Time season.  Okay, so the special effects aren't all that awe-inspiring, but who watches Dr Who for the special effects?  The story, involving tribal worshipping of a god who turns out to be an outsized squid-like beast and the invasion of a primative culture, is well-written and entertaining. Tom Baker is at his best, and the final episode is a blast.",1021075200,3,475,4.448275862068965
796344,4,6304154151,"On Delta 3, the Doctor and Romana get involved with four employees at a methane catalyzing protein refinery, the blue-green Swampies, transplanted from their Delta Magna home, and their god, a leviathan of a giant squid called Kroll.  A gun-runner named Rohm-Dutt has delivered guns to the Swampies so the natives can attack the refinery.  The Swampies capture Romana and plan to sacrifice her to Kroll.
Meanwhile, Thawn, controller of the refinery, and Fenner spot the Doctor.  Fenner mistakes the Doctor for Rohm-Dutt and shoots the Doctor's hat, narrowly missing him.  Thawn and Fenner take the Doctor at gunpoint, whereupon the unruffled Time Lord pipes up, ""Will there be strawberry jam for tea?""
A few things become apparent in the first two episodes.  Thawn immediately tells Fenner, ""You've shot the wrong man.""  How could he know?  And when Ranquin, the Swampie chief, tells Rohm-Dutt of Thawn's plan to attack them, he says, ""That wasn't what---"" before catching himself.  Things start to become clearer when Rohm Dutt calls out during the attack, ""Thawn, it's me, Rohm Dutt!""
The Doctor has his share of humorous and good lines.  Puzzled by the low gravity, he deduces that they are on one of Delta Magna's moons.  He licks his finger, holds it up, and says, ""I'd say the third.""  Romana replies, ""Doctor, sometimes I don't think you're quite right in the head.""  Romana on the Swampies' holy book:  ""A sort of holy writ?""  Doctor:  ""It's atrociously writ.""
Romana's moment of psychiatric analysis comes when she tells Rohm-Dutt, ""Emotional insultation is indicative of psychofugal trauma.""  When she tells him she and the Doctor were out hunting butterflies, Dutt says, ""Oh, I like a joke.""  Romana shoots back, ""I'll try and think of one.""
Ranquin tells Romana, ""You will wish you have died on the stone of blood.""  Pardon me, Ranquin, but that was two stories back, and it was the Doctor who nearly died on it.
The plight of the Swampies, evicted from Delta Magna and onto Delta 3, is reminiscent to that of the Native Americans, who were pushed off towards the west, only to suffer further loss with the onrush of Manifest Destiny and industrialization, what white men would call ""progress.""  When Fenner asks the Doctor, ""would you let a small band of semi-savages stand in the way of progress?""  the Doctor replies, ""Progress is a very flexible word.  It can mean whatever you want it to mean.""
Four Who-guest star alumni make their appearance here.  Neil McCarthy (Thawn) came out in The Mind Of Evil, Philip Madoc (Fenner) was in The Krotons and The Brain Of Morbius, John Abineri was in The Ambassadors Of Death and Death To The Daleks, and John Leeson is seen in human form for the first time as opposed to voicing a certain mechanical dog who doesn't appear here.
I sure hope the actors playing Swampies didn't get any skin allergies or cancer from that blue-green paint on their bodies.
Kroll is realized well, not bad for a titanic squid 140 feet high and five miles across-the only trouble is the obvious vertical line separating Kroll from the actual footage.  And the colonization theme involving a corporation oppressing a less-developed species works here.",1015632000,,3185,4.901119402985074

796346,2,6304154151,"This is by far the poorest story in the Key to Time season, a season that has long held a fond place in my memory. ""The Power of Kroll"" satisfies my nostalgia only slightly. Watching it in recent years has not enamored me to it - it is a bland story, indifferently directed and acted.  Even Doctor Who guest stalwarts like John Abineri and Philip Madoc look less than enthused. (In all fairness, Madoc auditioned for the role of Thawn; had he played this part he probably would have made the character more interesting. Being stuck with the role of Fenner certainly limited Madoc's talent for playing excellent villains.) The Swampies are also ridiculous, some might say insulting, cliches of a native people. For a story meant to be a commentary on colonialism and indigenous dispossession, ""The Power of Kroll"" shoots itself in the foot. There is also the problem of Kroll itself - when the monster rises from the swamps, the special effects are embarrassingly bad. However, the monster itself is a brilliant design, and the scene of it rising from the water to engulf the refinery IS very good (if you ignore the toy model of the refinery). The story is also fairly short, but it is not pacy - it's just a lot of running around, escaping and being recaptured, and basically going nowhere. There are a few positive points. The location scenery in Iken Marshes is wonderful and the final ""confrontation"" on the refinery platform is taut and exciting. However, it is spoiled by a boring and pointless ""post-crisis crisis"", presumably written just to fill up space.  Buy this only if you are a purist and want the complete Key to Time series.

This story, for example, is a pretty limp attempt to do a 'King Kong'.  The silly-looking natives are replaced  by (arguably) even sillier-looking men in green paint and wooly hats, who  chant 'Kroll' instead of 'Kong'.  The characters are pretty wooden and  virtually nothing seems to happen for most of the adventure.
On the plus  side, Tom Baker's Doctor is at his best and the whole thing is taken  seriously, which is certainly a refreshing change in what is mainly a  rather childish era of the series.

7863324,3,6304154151,"There are Doctor Who scripts that are so wonderful, so perfectly matched to the Doctor, and so timelessly wonderful, that they are guaranteed instant classics. The Power of Kroll is not such a story.

In search of the Fifth Segment of the Key of Time, the Doctor and Romana land on a moon that's ripe with conflict between a methane plant with four employees and a group of green-skinned natives who worship a giant squid.

Perhaps, the most challenging of this story is that writer Robert Holmes was told to play down the humor while producing a story featuring the biggest monster in Doctor Who history to date. Holmes succeeded on both accounts, however the story suffered as a concept like this is hard to play straight and have it taken seriously.

The result is an often B-movie feel, though in a less satisfying way to similar Doctor Who stories like the Pyramids of Mars or the Face of Evil.  This is brought about by generally weak acting. The worst offenders are the crew of the refinery who look quite bored through  the first three parts even while facing deadly peril making those portions almost interminable.  The script also gives short shrift to Romana which is a true shame.

The one part of the scenario that does work is Kroll himself. While modern CGI could do better, they do a good job for the time in making Kroll look truly intimidating from a distance. The close up shots of his tentacles also look pretty good particularly when compared to similar effects during the show's early years.

Of course, what makes this working is Tom Baker as the Doctor. He's a dynamo of energy, and on his game with plenty of daring do, and lots of humor. Whether Holmes gave Baker these lines or he ad-libbed them, in every scene he's in, Baker's a delight and at the top of his game. With a little help from a Giant Squid, the Doctor not only saves the day, but he carries the story and makes it worth watching despite the weak spot.",1413936000,,1943,4.531428571428571
