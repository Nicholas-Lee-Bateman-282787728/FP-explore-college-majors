8484073,1,B0012XGL0C,"This is pure release! DO NOT BUY IT if You are Elton John fan. It has very low meaning with Elton and his musical stuff. This DVD has been released also with different covers but the concert's cut is the same. This is not whole show, just few songs. From those are some played by Billy Joel, some by Billy and Elton together. Nothing from Just Elton.
If You do not see a whole show, the cuted concept of this DVD is bad.",1363392000,3,420,4.072289156626506
