2871314,2,B000ROA01I,I didn't read the ad carefully and found it was the 1986 and 1990 superbowl and not superbowl XLII.  Wasted my money.,1209600000,2,117,4.318181818181818
2871315,5,B000ROA01I,"The America's Game: NY Giants 2-DVD set is a definite must-have for Giants fans.  I have (and still enjoy) the VHS copies of ""Giants among Men"" from the 1986 season and ""True Blue"" from the 1990 season.  While they give a game-by-game replay of those seasons, the America's Game set goes into the personalities, the challenges, and the triumps of some of the key players on those teams.  The AG series is a celebration of the humanity of the players who are encased in so many layers of padding, we do not experience the personal highs and lows they go through - not only within the game, but with each other on and off the field.  Steve Sabol has rectified this with an excellent new approach to the game, its players and coaches.  Parcells, Simms, LT, Hoss, OJ and more are there to add a very personal touch to the 86 and 90 seasons.  You won't regret buying this DVD set",1206748800,5,874,4.39751552795031
2871316,5,B000ROA01I,"Great stuff here, rekindling the memories and loving it, lots of indepth looks and interviews with some of the GIANTS GREATS with plenty of highlight films and raw footage of the players and coaches during the seasons of 86 and 90. If your a Diehard fan and bleed TRUE BLUE, then this a must for your collection.",1206403200,2,312,4.491228070175438
2871317,5,B000ROA01I,"Yes, I'm a Giants fan, and after the ""Road Warriors"" Super Bowl win this year (2008), to go back and see the gang from the '86 & `90 Super Bowl wins--how sweet it is!
The videos give you a wonderful peek at the major players:  Lawrence Taylor, Phil Simms, Harry Carson, Carl Banks, Mike Bavarro (great interview), O.J. Anderson, Jeff Hostetler and Coach Parcells, who disappointingly, left NY just after the '90 championship.  Harry Carson, a Hall of Famer, is a great treat to listen to.  Imagine, he got into the Hall of Fame, despite the fact, that he couldn't even win a coin toss for the Giants.  (Ha, ha)
As a kid, I got to see my first Giants game as kid, on a free ticket from my Dad's bar, all alone, at Yankee Stadium, watching the Giants beat the St. Louis Cardinals in the snow.  Rooting for the Giants  during all those lean, Allie Sherman, years makes these DVDs, really special.  Ok, I laughed, I cried, I cheered.  So what?",1204156800,5,939,4.4186046511627906
2871318,5,B000ROA01I,Great job by NFL Films. A must have for all Giants fans. I can't wait to see what they do with the story of the 2007 Champions.,1203811200,2,127,3.740740740740741
2871319,5,B000ROA01I,"...you'll want to get this DVD set.

It's not the same old rehashing of the 1986 and 1990 seasons. It's a recounting of the events that led up to those magical seasons. Brand new interviews with LT, Parcells, Simms, Hoss, O.J. and Banks...and the little stories surrounding those drives to the titles. The 1986 DVD is especially interesting in particular because it spans the time frame between the Pisarcik fumble to Phil Simms jersey retirement ceremony.

I agree with the previous reviewer. If you're a Giants fan...YOU MUST MUST MUST own this set! There's no excuse for you not to.",1203033600,,585,4.84
2871320,5,B000ROA01I,"Steve Sabol is head of NFL Films and over the years, he has put together some incredible documentaries. But I think NFL Films' series America's Game, which debuted on NFL Network last year, could be the best thing they've ever done.

Each set recounts the story behind each team's championship season. In this case, the set collects the America's Game docs for the 1986 and 1990 New York Giants. Each documentary is narrated (the '86 documentary is done by Laurence Fishbourne and the '90 documentary is done by Alec Baldwin) and features insight from three integral coaches and players. Head Coach Bill Parcells, QB Phil Simms, and LB Lawrence Taylor are interviewed for the '86 season. The '90 season features QB Jeff Hostetler, LB Carl Banks, and RB Ottis Anderson.

These documentaries bring such insight into the runs these teams made. It's amazing how tight and yet oddly dysfunctional the Giants were under Parcells. The relationship between Simms and Parcells was rocky at first, but they both describe how close they became. The '90 Giants story is equally compelling, with how Hostetler filling in for the injured Simms. Carl Banks is particularly great here.

There also some great extras, mostly short documentaries made by NFL Films. The standout is a ten minute segment on legendary Giants TE Mark Bavaro.

Any Giants fan owes himself this set. A fan of the New York Football Giants must own this set. There's no excuse for not owning it.",1201219200,14,1452,4.914285714285715
8201762,4,B000ROA01I,"It's the Giants - how can you not love it :-)?
They have had so many mediocre seasons - watch this one a couple of times and forget about the bad, remember the good times.",1469923200,,171,3.914285714285714

8201765,5,B000ROA01I,"It was great to hear comments from certain players LT, Simms, Carson and the Coach Parcells about Super bowl XXI. Also the Prediction from OJ Anderson's Dream coming true about becoming a Superbowl MVP in the State of Florida when he was in college. That dream came true in Superbowl XXV. Hearing comments from Jeff Hostetler and Carl Banks was good as well. If your a Giants fan you will want both of these DVD's.
  I am curious when America Game DVD's will go on sale for Super Bowl XLII and XLVI. I Like to see and hear Tom Coughlin, Eli Mannings, Mario Manningham and of course the ""Catch"" from David Tyree.",1362009600,,611,4.446428571428571
8201766,5,B000ROA01I,"All of these ""America's Game"" series are absolutely spectacular.  I've purchased several sets (Cowboys, 49ers, Broncos, etc) and every single one has been simply outstanding.  NFL Network does a great job with all their stuff, but this series definitely tops the cake!  Out of all the ones I own from this series, I'm partial to the Giants because I grew up watching them, and these two Superbowls.  The NFC title games during the 80's sometimes seemed better than the actual Superbowl...sometimes.  :)",1325289600,,502,5.073170731707317
8201767,5,B000ROA01I,"The two DVD's in this package are both excellent. The format of the films is spot on in my opinion. The first disc has the 86 season and insights offered by Phil Simms, LT and Bill Parcells. The second has Parcells but with OJ Anderson and Carl Banks. All of them offer brilliant anecdotes about what it was like back in the day. There is footage from all of the important games too.
A really well put together DVD from NFL Films.",1223251200,,430,4.2560975609756095
8201768,5,B000ROA01I,I'VE BEEN A GIANTS FAN SINCE THEY DRAFTED ROCKY THOMPSON IN '71. THESE VIDEOS ARE FANTASTIC SINCE THEY TAKE YOU BEHIND THE SCENES AND YOU SEE WHAT LT WENT THRU AND HOSS'S ROAD TO GLORY. A MUST FOR ALL TRUE GIANTS FANS. I CAN'T  WAIT FOR THE 2009 VERSION WHEN THEY DEFEAT THE PATS AGAIN!!,1221782400,,287,4.218181818181818
8201769,5,B000ROA01I,"As a diehard Giants fan this is a must have DVD. To hear the perspective from players and coaches was fastastic. The NFL Network does a great job on both SBs and their ""America's Game"" series is outstanding. I can't wait for them to come out with SB 42!!",1215475200,,254,4.204081632653061
8201770,2,B000ROA01I,I am an American In Ireland. If I wanted a long winded interview about the Giants I can watch the BBC. They're great at it.,1214179200,,123,3.96
8201771,5,B000ROA01I,I have watched many shows on the Giants past Super Bowls but these two DVD's showed clips that I had never seen before.  Alot of behind the scenes (locker room) conversations that were fun to watch.  I would recommend this DVD highly.,1213833600,,234,4.5476190476190474
