7867394,2,6304294034,"It all started with the movie case.  It was visibly falling apart but I figured hey what would that matter, the treasure inside is what matters.  So I put the movie in my VHS player and voila it works... but there was a continuous blue line across the top that was clearly from damaged film. So I though maybe just maybe it was my VHS player. So I tried it in a different one hooked up to a different tv, but nope! Still there.  If this wasn't my favorite movie, there would have been no way I would have been able to ignore it.

Summary: When I got it I bought it under the idea it was in pretty good condition.  It had clear film and case problems that hindered its functionality.  I wouldn't be upset if it would have been listed in the correct condition. BUYER BEWARE",1394150400,,771,4.175675675675675

7867397,5,6304294034,"I doubt if this article is a review. Maybe it won't be useful to you,but all the words you are reading express my true feelings.  Mighty Ducks the movie is a most wonderful movie I have ever seen. It is interesting and  exciting. The story attractive,the characters lovely and the quotes  humorous. All of these are impressive. Besides,I learned a lot from this  movie,such as teamwork,determination,courage, faith and so on. Of  course,this movie isn't perfect,but it's pretty good. If you are a loyal
Mighty Ducks fan,please don't miss it!",962323200,12,541,5.033707865168539
7867398,4,6304294034,"This movie was made up of the first three episodes of the ""Mighty Ducks"" TV show, when it was probably at its best. The basic premise of this show tended to be weak, but their were moments when it showed a spark  of inspiration, such as the Duck's initial distaste for humans and the  conflict at first when Dragonas threatened Earth.  Why should we help this  alien civilization?  Once they became standard-issue superheroes, the show  lost much of its interesting parts.  It became just another  Saturday-morning cookie-cutter action cartoon.  The only interesting part  was the subplot of trying to get back to Puckworld, and with the  cancellation of show, that was left unresolved.  This show only needed a  little tweaking to put near ""Gargoyles"" in strength of narrative.",958262400,8,778,4.984375
