Having a cast of remarkable characters is a big help, and luckily this one delivers.  You have the strict and obedient Lieutenant Bobby who's in charge of his soldiers.  A news reporter/camera lady named Lisa who goes around interviewing the soldiers *while* in combat which is funny.  Corporal Dani is my favorite.  She's the tough chick who doesn't take crap from anyone, especially puny little runts who rank lower than her.  The arm wrestling match she has with Private Red Flynn is memorable!  He's one of those skinny weakling guys who can't do anything right and can't defend himself.  I like how Dani pushes him against the wall and threatens that he shut his mouth, then he cries sexual harassment to the Lieutenant based on him ranking lower than Dani, lol!  I was convinced at one point Dani would eventually beat Red Flynn up given how he wouldn't stop annoying and criticizing her.

Other characters include a perverted Italian guy named Sergeant Mike.  He fires one sexual joke after another.  Also another guy who's basically a slightly bigger version of Private Red Flynn named Private Billy.  He's... sexually shy let's put it that way, lol.  He tries to act bad but he can't, especially around women.  All 6 of these characters are awesome, as is the voodoo doll lady... and her younger bigger whiter self, lol.  That brings us to the story.  When a couple soldiers track down and kill a man for looting somewhere in the Florida swamp lands, the grandmother comes out of the house (the voodoo lady).  She's extremely angry and has a doll with her.  When she tears the arm of the doll, the soldier who shot her grandson gets his arm ripped off by some strange force.

This movie won't appeal to everyone, and horror lovers will probably express the biggest disappointment.  These characters march through the swamps in search of someone they're assigned to find and bring back to the base.  There's periods where the soldiers march for a couple minutes and nothing happens. I can't help but feel, of all the war movies I've seen over the years, it's kinda remarkable how *this* realistic aspect of being a soldier is never shown in those movies.  These soldiers sneak around and walk slowly through the swamps.  And in a movie that's not even supposed to emphasize soldiers of all things!

The soldiers split up pretty soon.  One group finds the man they're looking for... with his arms ripped off and lying on the ground. Yup the victim of the voodoo lady was the guy these soldiers were assigned to find.  A moment later they open a barn door and see an overweight topless woman.  A couple sexual jokes later much to the dissatisfaction of Corporal Dani, they bring her back to the location the other soldiers are staying.  She's a very quiet woman the whole time.  There's a reason for this later on however.  SPOILERS!  She's actually a younger version of the voodoo lady who chose to get her revenge on the soldiers since they killed her grandson!  The way we eventually see the woman suddenly switch into her older current self and holding a gun is quite bizarre, but really fun!  I can't believe she's able to strike a deal that the remaining soldiers won't report any of the murders the voodoo lady's responsible for and she won't have to kill them.  Seems fair!  I thought for sure Lisa was going to be a victim.  The lady brings up a good point too- is it worth killing someone just for stealing baby diapers, formula and food?  No it's not.  Even the Lieutenant agrees.

There's another guy who Private Billy teases and threatens with a knife.  The guy jumps around every time Billy pulls a knife at the camp site which is amusing.  Lieutenant Bobby makes sure Billy doesn't take things too far.  When Corporal Dani and Billy wash their clothes in the lake together, Dani knows that Billy doesn't want to wash his clothes in the shallow end because she'd see his ""small size"".  Awesome!  The Italian guy making sex jokes left and right is also quite humorous.  Meanwhile Lisa's growing more affectionate for Lieutenant Bobby by the hour.  She likes a big strong man who can keep her warm!  Too bad he keeps the overweight woman warm instead, lol.  All the while while these crazy characters are being silly, that overweight woman remains quiet.

No this movie won't win any awards.  It's definitely on the low budget side and I wouldn't call it anywhere near a horror, but darn is it ever entertaining!  The movie does show the devastation a hurricane can cause though.  It's very serious in the first 5 minutes for sure.  That is the story after all.  These military men and women have to make sure looters don't get out of control after the hurricane hit.  I would recommend this movie.",1500336000,,4975,4.659378596087457

8197275,1,B000QTD02K,"once again a great cover misleads into purchasing an awful movie.
the dead?plural?there is actualy one un-dead voodoo animated guy that the entire movie was howling behind bushes that comes out on the 50th minute of the film!
another fun day in the fields with the friends of the director and his fat topless girlfriend to up the stakes a bit!
some movies should be sold for 1 dollar,or with free beer maybe?then it would be fun to watch,and not feel sorry for the money you gave?at least pay for the beers?",1245456000,3,507,4.521739130434782

8197277,1,B000QTD02K,"What a piece of CRAP! The only good thing about this movie was...well, there's actually 3 good things...1) the artwork on the dvd case, 2) the plotline sounded interesting, as there aren't a whole lot of ""voodoo zombies"" around nowadays, and 3) when it was over!! There are NO redeeming qualitites in this movie whatsoever!

1) ACTING--the acting was so-so to say the least, and the stereotypical characters were disappointing. (wimpy guy, tough army chick, etc.)

2) ZOMBIES--wait...let me correct that...ZOMBIE. There is only ONE zombie in this movie and he doesn't appear until the 75 minute point in the movie! (and the movie is only 89 minutes long!) The zombie does a little bit of walking around and that's it. And the zombie looked nothing like the bloodthirsty hellion on the dvd case! A little bit of white face powder and presto! zombie!

3) SPECIAL EFFECTS--it would appear that the Halloween department at your local Wal-mart handled the special effects to this one. An occasional severed limbs pops up here and there, and the rest of the deaths consist of the victim covered in blood, with their army t-shirt torn.

4) NUDITY--here's some boobs, there's some boobs, but, nothing that you WANT to see...

5) SETTING--not sure where this was filmed, but the fact that while the soldiers are walking through this dense swampland, the viewer can see wear marks on the land where the grass has been worn down made me think it was at some type of preserve.

6) VOODOO--the voodoo aspect was minimal to say the least. Very disappointing.

Overall, a really bad movie that I couldn't even recommend to a zombie movie completist to see. It's a terrible waste of time. Save yourselves...avoid this movie at all costs.
