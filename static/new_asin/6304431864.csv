883620,1,6304431864,"At the time of this writing, there is one other review, and sadly, I agree with it.  I lost interest in the first minute, but I watched all of it, in the hope that something would happen.  It's very boring throughout, and really I had the feeling I was sloughing through mud.  Although I know from personal experience that receiving comfort from a female friend can be innocent, it's not really clear in this movie.  The entire movie is very disappointing!

Side note: It's been over a month since I wrote the above review, and to the 3rd reviewer on here: I didn't like Dallas OR Deliverance, and I most definitely wasn't expecting anything like that.  I had no preconceived notions about this movie when I watched it, and I try not to ever prejudge anything before I watch it.  This movie is a MAJOR SNORE, complete with HIDEOUS acting, and it has nothing to do with the fact that I'm from America.",1353024000,5,900,4.484662576687117
883621,1,6304431864,"At first I thought this was going to be somewhat humorous like Ann of Green Gables. However, it just plodded along with the predictable lives of students' boarding at school and their old maid looking teachers. It's not even worth telling of the details. The story seemed disconnected, and at times, the audio made it hard to hear and understand the characters. Then, toward the end, there's a hint of lesbianism with three students; one of whom is expelled for stealing and an older one, who invites the leading character into her bed.
Maybe a young woman inviting another one into her narrow bed for comfort was purely innocent. I'll never know. Regardless, the movie was just long, drawn out and dull, and I'm sorry I watched it.",1347494400,8,732,4.7265625
883622,5,6304431864,"First saw this a number of years ago when it was first released and loved it.  A wonderful coming of age flick that treads lightly, but firmly, where others might sensationalize.  Had to get it the PAL version since it's not available in US format.  Wish I knew why great films like this haven't yet been released by US companies (although The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith recently came out thankfully).",1233878400,9,400,4.685714285714286
883623,5,6304431864,This is a gem of a film from Australia. Susannah Fowle in the lead role as Laura is well acted and keeps you interested right to the end. I love this film and would highly recommend it.,1071619200,9,185,4.027027027027027
883624,1,6304431864,"This Australian film directed by Bruce Beresford was made in 1977 but not released in the U.S. until 1980, when overseas interest in Australian films was fueled by titles like My Brilliant Career and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith. However Beresford is a lesser talent than either of the directors of those two films, Gillian Armstrong and Fred Schepisi. This film is like the underbelly of Peter Weir's 1975 Picnic at Hanging Rock, also set in a turn of the century ladies college, but while Weir's title is all romantic lyricism, Beresford goes for lowbrow comedy. Beresford's out to show how schoolgirls are just as cruel as schoolboys by placing a fish-out-of-water into their ""well-bred"" environment. Of course, it's no surprise that the impoverished heroine Laura is far more civilised than the other girls. That is, until she learns that the ""wisdom"" to be got is being an opportunist. Pauline Kael put it best when she wrote ""what she learns is the principle of contagion - that you get close to the powerful, so that their power can rub off on you, and stay clear of the helpless and weak, so their failure won't infect you"". Such is the rewards of finishing schools. Beresford even gives us a freeze-frame close-up of Laura with over-bite begging for acceptance. He isn't interested in presenting these girls as beautiful or sensuous, and deliberately shows their facial pimples and awkward bodies. Even the suggestion of lesbianism in Laura's relationships with 2 girls are diffused by making one fat and expelled (for stealing from the others to buy a ring for Laura), and the other a rich older student, who cradles Laura in bed like a mother. The female staff are also grotesques - Sheila Helpmann as the schoolmistress wears an unwavering look of disdain, though when she drops it at Laura's graduation, we get a laugh, and Beresford undercuts the sight of floating black swans that Laura feeds by having them bleet loudly. The film works the best with Beresford's use of Laura's piano playing, when he edits to his comic routines, but he unfortunately indulges Barry Humphries as the school's minister in a long monologue where he denounces the thieving friend.",970099200,8,2177,4.918478260869565

883824,2,6304431864,"(by John's wife, Julie -- CONTAINS SPOILERS)

I thoroughly enjoy period pieces and, yes, have seen several that were set in all-girls' schools but this one went way too far astray of what I enjoy seeing in finishing school stories!

Instead of learning what it means to be a successful and/or admirable woman, our 'heroine' learns to lie, bully, and cheat to get ahead.  Even though she, herself, was taunted and hurt so much she cried more than once, she decided it was better to treat other new girls just as cruelly as she'd experienced because, evidently, it's more important to be liked by the bullying in-crowd than to develop a character.

Another 'wonderful' lesson she learned was that it works to cheat (on a final exam) because she was still recognized as a top student in the school. (I know the recognition wasn't for that class, but what would have happened to her life had she gotten caught?)

If this is even remotely autobiographically motivated as some here have said, I would have thought she would have been too embarrassed to confess the lousy woman she became.  Or, well, I guess she never found that out.",1383436800,5,1127,4.695431472081219

I owned a beat-up VHS copy for a long time and was thrilled to be able to have an updated DVD of this remarkable film.",1358985600,,332,4.6440677966101696
883827,5,6304431864,"What is this film, The Getting of Wisdom""?

Two other (American reviewers) found it boring.
I am extremely surprised.

Yes, it begins slowly, and oddly.

Picture a red-dusty outback village. (Think Arizona, or Monument Valley, and you're nearly there.)
Think, Wild West, without the guns or macho cowboys: about 1890.
People are calling for ""Laura ..."", ""Laura ..."".
In the distance, ignoring the voices of authority, Laura is performing for her adoring captive audience, her younger sister. Laura is about to leave the family, and the bush (the desert-like village), and go to an exclusive, expensive, big-city all-girls college. Right now she is showing off, as usual, telling her sister how some far-fetched romantic made-up adventure story will end.
(Remember how Lousia Alcott's wild-eyed heroine Jo Marsh hammed it up declaiming ""Rodrigo, Rodrigo, saaaave meee!"" Laura is that sort of over-the-top dreamer and story-teller.)
Laura is a big-fish in a little pond, about to plunge into a much larger, cruel pond.

And so it goes. Are you bored by this?
Just wait.
Later, when we have become accustomed to Laura bluffing and struggling against her dismissive wealthy sophisticated class-mates, we realise Laura has become smitten by the new chaplain for her school: a gorgeously handsome young married man (played by smouldering John Waters.)
Laura wangles a weekend as guest of the chaplain and his family.
Cue the appaling behaviour of the arrogant chaplain, and Laura's dreams shattered.

Bored?
Just wait.
A newcomer to the school idolises Laura, who remembers enough of her own early pains at the school to be slightly friendly to the newcomer.
The newcomer wants to show her devotion, and suggests buying a ring for Laura.
Unfortunately her plans go awry.
Cue the appearance of the full-time chaplain of the school, played icily by Barry Humphries, dramatically different from his often grotesque role of ""Dame Edna Everage"". Humphries can ACT!
And he acts up a storm, pouring fire and brimstone on the unhappy newcomer!

This is surely not boring!

And how about Laura, later, more self-assured, but this time struggling to deal with her own heroine-worshipping feelings for the older, beautiful student. (Laura herself is far from pretty, and knows this. What she has going for her is not looks, but brains and musical talent!) We see, in glimpses, the glances between Laura and her (naked) room-mate.

Boring? What do you want? ""Dallas""? ""Deliverance""?

For me this is a brilliantly made film.
The title comes from a Biblical passage extolling the benefit of acquiring wisdom: highly relevant both for its school setting, and for the glaring need of the central character to become more self-aware and sensitive to others.

The film is based reasonably closely on the autobiographical novel of the same name.
It is lovingly filmed in the old buildings and rooms of MLC (Methodist Ladies College, in Kew, a suburb of Melbourne, and in parks in East Melbourne close the site of the actual school the author attended and based the story on, and in a grand house in rural Victoria.

In real life the author won a music scholarship to study at Leipzig. (This event arises in the last minutes of the film.)
She (Henry Handel Richardson, her pen-name) later wrote a book about this European venture, and a failed career in virtuoso concert-music-making, called ""Maurice Guess"", filmed by Charles Vidor as ""Rhapsody"", starring Elizabeth Taylor!

Later as a matured author, Henry Handel Richardson wrote one of Australia's great novels, based on the life of her father, ""The Fortunes of Richard Mahony"".

The casting of ""The Getting of Wisdom"" is superb, and explains the plainess of the central character, Laura Tweedle Ramsbotham (the ""th"" is pronounced, deliberately, to avoid any hint of ""bottom"" in the name).

Rather than the other famous Australian school-girl film ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"", this film ought to be compared with ""My Brilliant Career"", directed by Gillian Armstrong, starring Judy Davis and Sam Neill, another outstanding Australian film about intellectual brilliance trapped in stifling rural life and class-riddled society.

While often hard to watch, because it is emotionally excoriating, this is because of the film's quality of acting, scripting, casting, and production that so vividly capture the pains of teenage bewilderment, and the era.
Imagine watching a film about Louisa Alcott's famous rebel-girl would-be-writer Jo March going to an exclusive snobbish all-girls' college; sparks would fly, and often viewers would grimace at the clashes of personality, values, and brains. That's how this film is.

Instead, our young lady learns to manipulate, lie, cheat, and treat others just like the mean girls treated her.

7871894,4,6304431864,"""The Getting of Wisdom"" is a strange little film that was apparently based on a popular Australian children's book series from the early 1900s.  If this is true, then Australian children must be very sophisticated indeed.  The lead character, Laura, attends an all-girls religious college.  She has a very vivid imagination, and wants so desperately to be accepted that she begins spinning stories about an imagined affair with the college's new young minister (married, spoiled, horrible!)  She then begins an actual affair with an older female student at the school.

The film was made in 1978, and the cinematography may seem a little dated.  The shots are fuzzy, the costumes are either boring or freakishly colorful, and the dialogue can be a bit shrill.  Still, if you're the sort of person who enjoys somewhat obscure coming of age stories from another day and time, you might want to give this one a try.",1451692800,,912,4.921568627450981

But I still felt blind sided when she climbed into bed with her friend for a lesbian relationship. If I could give less than one star, I would. The first hour I spent hoping for a better turn of events. Instead, it remained an overall dreary tale throughout. I shut the movie off when the bedroom scene started.
