4907677,5,B005ZC823K,"I'd heard many times how popular and well liked this show is but never got around to watching it.
I happened to catch the first two episodes online and immediately fell in love with the characters and the writing.
The Pilot might very well be the best written first episode I've ever seen of any show.
This is a great set with lots of extras, deleted scenes and outtakes that add to the overall enjoyment.
Not sure what price the disgruntled reviewer paid but my purchase was very reasonable and certainly less than I would have paid had I gone for the individual seasons.
To be honest, it was such a good price I was worried it might be one of those sets that includes all the episodes but no extras (I foolishly bought a 24 boxed set that disappointed like that and returned it!), but it was exactly what I hoped it would be.
I really can't imagine too many people not liking this show.
If you were considering it, buy it.
If you weren't (just as I wasn't), buy it anyway.
You won't be sorry.",1355875200,,994,4.320855614973262
4907678,1,B005ZC823K,"If you've never seen the show, it's one of the best comedy shows in a long time. If you are unsure, it's worth purchasing a couple of individual shows.

*** Buyer Beware ***
This seller who is charging twice what it's worth. You can buy individual seasons for $17 - $22 a season.",1355788800,11,279,4.264150943396227

4907681,5,B005ZC823K,"This was cheaper then buying the videos individually which is awesome. This show is amazing and one of the best shows on tv today. I think this is the Seinfeld of the next generation but instead of about nothing, you get stuff that carries over to real life. It will be a very sad day when this show ends.",1433980800,,305,4.186440677966102
4907682,5,B005ZC823K,"Amazing price!  I've already watched them all.  Received them very quickly, they were exactly as described.  Only quirk was that the inside CD holder is not attached to the case, but that's not the fault of the seller that's a manufacturer thing.  So I would definitely recommend this item.",1428537600,,290,4.857142857142857

4907686,5,B005ZC823K,"Modern Family is the best comedy on television and at $24 for three seasons on Bluray, it's a steal! Yes, this is the UK version, but as long as you have a Bluray player and it has the latest software updates you'll have no problem. This is the same episodes and same features as the U.S. Bluray version.",1417910400,,304,4.258620689655173

4907688,5,B005ZC823K,"For three seasons this was one of the best comedies ever. I've found the writing in Seasons 4 and 5 disappointing. But of course, if you buy Seasons 1-3 and like them as much as I did, you'll have to buy Season 4, hoping you won't agree with me.",1414540800,,245,4.020408163265306
