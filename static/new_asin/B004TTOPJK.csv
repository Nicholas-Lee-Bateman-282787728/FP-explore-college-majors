8440871,4,B004TTOPJK,I picked this up at the Motor City Nightmares horror convention and was quite impressed. I've never really paid too much attention to short films but this movie is making me change my mind. It was well paced and timed perfectly. This movie definitely delivered the goods and didn't leave much to be desired. I'm definitely looking forward to checking out the rest of the Poison Apple film library.,1308787200,,397,4.768115942028985
