Everything that didn't really make sense in the first DVD is all tied together, and from then on the story is very exciting! It is still about the people, and not about mindless action, but now that you understand the character's personalities, things start happening to them that challenge them and bring out their good qualities.  I like all of the characters even more after watching this DVD.  If you were slightly disappointed with the first one, don't give up yet-it gets so much better!!! The only thing I can think of to criticize is that in some places the artwork is a little bit sketchy, but the artists make up for it by adding much more beautiful, lifelike touches to the characters.  The eyes are especially wonderful.  But now I'm rambling.",1109808000,4,884,4.528301886792453
