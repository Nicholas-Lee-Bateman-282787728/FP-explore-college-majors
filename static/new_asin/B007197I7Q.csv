Rather than giving you a full review, I just have to say see it!  It's gory horror with laughs at its best.  You'll laugh while being completely grossed out.  Those with weak stomachs might even vomit, but it's well worth it! But, gore aside, there's also enough emotion in the script where you'll tear up in the end. I cannot wait to see more from Sartorio.  He's definitely a hidden gem in Hollywood. Do not miss this movie!",1395532800,2,556,4.63265306122449
