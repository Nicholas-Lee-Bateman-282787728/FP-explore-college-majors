8178491,5,B000NJLQP6,I already knew the five pentatonic positions.  I wanted to learn how to blend them with appropriate chords and how to tie them together up and down the fretboard.  The DVD did that for me.  I now plan to purchase his two fretboard DVD's.,1290643200,2,237,4.340909090909091
8178492,1,B000NJLQP6,"I know all of the shapes of the minor pentatonic scale.  I was looking for instruction that would show me how to use the tools in my box.  This video is NOT it.  This seems WAY more advanced than that, which might be what you're looking for, but not me.

Before we even start with the pentatonic scale, this guy launches into a number of obscure chords.  It appears that he believes that the viewer already knows how these tie together with the scale, but I don't know what he is talking about.  Plus, he blasts through the demonstrations so fast that it was very difficult to keep up with what he was doing.

On one hand, he wants to demonstrate the five positions of the minor pentatonic scale, which seems to suggest the DVD is intended for a beginner/intermediate audience, but then he launches into a number of strange chords without explaining how they relate to what he has just explained.  He demonstrates numerous chords up and down the neck, but it's unclear what they have to do with the C minor pentatonic scale that he has just shown.

From what I can tell, the DVD is mostly about chord pairings with scales you may know.  I was looking for instruction on how to use the pentatonic scale to improvise nice sounding solos, but bottom line, I have no idea what this guy is talking about.",1255219200,4,1299,4.443037974683544
