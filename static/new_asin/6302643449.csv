489297,2,6302643449,"How depressing to see such a talented band fall into the ""Bloated Elvis Syndrom"". Spoiled to the point of overindulgence and it shows. The stage is so big, that you rarely see the whole band all at one time or  in one spot, or for that matter anywhere near each other. They don't even  seem like a band anymore, but 5 seperate pieces floating around in  nothingness. The backup singers really bring an extra helping of crappola  to the show, complete with flutes, horns and all the cheeziness of a Poison  concert. What happened to the raw attitude they used to have? My  grandmother would enjoy this, but if your a die hard GNR fan, and you want  to see them play as a band, and not a circus act than go find a copy of  ""Guns N Roses Live at the Ritz 1988"". If your really a glutton  for punishment Ill gladly sell you mine.",934070400,2,825,4.237179487179487

His singing was outstanding until the last song. He started to lose his voice, but still hit the notes he needed to. You could tell it was a struggle, but he pulled out November Rain as the last song on the DVD as perfect as you could get to a studio recording. Slash was amazing all the way through!

I'm exceedingly picky, but this DVD manages to satisfy even the toughest critic in me.  The band plays great and Axl puts on a very energetic performance while giving great vocals to some of their best songs up to that time.  I've owned this DVD for over 3 years so far and I still love it.

If you're a GNR fan I very strongly recommend you buy it.",1241136000,,482,3.9895833333333335
489493,4,6302643449,"As a fan of GnR I wasn't at all disappointed with this DVD. It's the closest I'll ever get to seeing the original boys in action and they do rock.  This concert was filmed during the Use Your Illusion tour in 1992 and for some strange reason they chose Tokyo as the concert to film. I say this is strange because the crowd is rather subdued and consequently the band seems to be missing that extra energy or spark that they usually seemed to posses at other live performances.  Still it's a great show and the boys give it there all, starting out slow(ish) and building to a chaotic climax. It's great to witness Axl's strutting and racing up and down the stage all the while screaming with his amazing voice, and Slash hitting the astonishing guitar solos especially the one at the end of Double talkin Jive. They have even tossed in a few short interviews with band members between songs which is good for a laugh.

The quality of the video is fine and for a price of 15 dollars this is well worth picking up. It also contains an excellent selection of 15 songs including; Nightrain, Mr. Brownstone, Live and let die, It's so easy, Bad obsession, Attitude, Pretty tied up, Welcome to the jungle, Don't cry, Double talkin jive, Civil war, Wild horses, Patience and November rain.

After watching this I found myself thinking with amazement and regret that there will never be another band like Guns N' Roses...Sigh.",1240099200,2,1416,4.58498023715415

489561,3,6302643449,"It's worth owning. I've seen the band together and they were great. The disc audio is not the problem, as is the audio for Axl's mic in the beginning tracks. It's like any concert. The sound is never flawless thru-out. There is no behind the scenes, or anything special. Buy it used for a cheaper price.",1198800000,,303,4.428571428571429
489562,4,6302643449,"I remember a live review by the Australian metal rag Hot Metal of a Def Leppard gig and the point made was that hospitals have a certain smell. That sanitised smell. Well this may be a live visual document of what was billed as the worlds most dangerous band but it's also the closest I've ever seen them seem sanitised.

Luckily for the band they'd written such a stack of excellent wattage that wandered between hard rock and metal. The set list for this first of two live videos released together and later transferred to DVD with no extras reads like a rivetheads wet dream. Songs like Nightrain and Mr Brownstone, visceral and doomed workouts from the debut that work their insinuating charm onto the listener, set the scene excellently. Live and Let Die provides a lighter moment and a certain fun factor before things get downright mean with It's So Easy. The music from the later Illusion albums is more polished, less vicious but more mature in it's rawk metal attack. Bad Obsession sounds like pretty much nothing from the debut and is obviously a work of a band on a slightly different wavelength creatively, Attitude and Pretty Tied Up set the scene for Welcome to the Jungle to lay waste to your last shreds of optimism.

With Axl wailing all over the place with THAT voice and the band a very well oiled machine the gear changes come easily, really by this time the band pretty much over-rehearsed. Which leads to a feeling of safety (see my opening paragraph). Despite this Don't Cry was a hit for the band and it follows up the aforementioned rockers. Then we get the funk metal of Double Talkin' Jive which provides, along with Bad Obsession, a rock track with a change of pace from the earlier material. Civil War rips along, though the feeling that they had to include at least one of the more marginally politically aware tunes does give you the impression that the set list was picked out with perhaps too much care. Which sounds stupid given my love of professionalism in bands, but the feeling with this whole release is one of over refinement. Wild Horses, the horrid Patience (how was that a hit?), and finally the monumental November Rain close out this dose of hard rock/metal that pretty much sums up the 1992 state of the commercial art for this genre.

With good production values - I saw the band on this tour and was impressed with the sound - this live release sees one of the greatest hard rock and metal bands ever to stalk the earth treading the boards - and have a look at the size of this stage. You don't get a stage that big unless your bigger than Ben Hur, so to speak.

It's been said by other reviewers that here the band look like they're going through the motions. Dead tired on their feet and playing by rote. All that would probably be right. But it's still great music and is the only live document we have of this band before the disintegration. Unless of course we one day get a release of the MTV special gig the band did on the tour for their debut - now THAT was a gig and a half. As mentioned above, this was transferred over to DVD with no extras (typical of the band) and so obviously get that in preference to this VHS release. But when all is said and done, if your a hard rock fan then you really should get this, and fans of the band really should get hold of it because they'll love it despite it's few faults.",1195171200,2,3371,4.432258064516129

489564,4,6302643449,"My review is for the entire Use Your Illusion concert (both UYI I and II DVDs). I'm yet another massive Guns n' Roses fan. I have been for many years. I'm 24 now but back when the UYI tours were on, my parents wouldn't let a 9 year old go to their concert, especially given the lyrical content of many of their songs. Needless to say that when I saw this DVD of the concert featuring the ""original"" gunners, I had extremely high expectations. This was to be an up-close and personal view of the gunners doing what they do best (rock on!!) and we all know that we'll never see Axl teamed with Duff, Slash, Matt and Gilby again.

Before I bought this DVD I read almost all the other reviews of this concert on amazon. I instantly decided to take the plunge and buy both discs and see for myself what I thought. I agree with many comments made by fellow reviewers and disagree with many others, however I'd also like to add my own views.

Pros
* As stated earlier, this is my only chance to see a real gunners concert raw and uncut featuring the ""original"" lineup. (When I say ""original"" I'm refering to the lineup before Axl's new arrangement. Personally I prefer Izzy Stradlin as a rhythm guitarist to Gilby Clark.)

* The track selection is superp! While you can never please everyone I'd say that no critical songs were missed. Personal favourites of mine not performed include Don't Damn Me, Think About You and Coma.

* As expected, the band is amazing. Slash's solos are exceptional, both Gilby and Matt provide a great rhythm section and Duff provides the killer bass. I personally like the second half of Move to the City with the jazz section and the piano/Dizzy Reed's keyboards. I also love the raw rocking tunes. Double Talkin' Jive is amazing.

Cons
* No special features, ie bonus interviews (other than the footage at the start showing the band backstage).

* The sound quality could have been a bit better. I agree with other reviewers when they can't see why a concert from 1992 can't be remastered in Dolby 5.1.

* Axl's voice is so unpredictable (he was hit and miss with many of the notes, ie Sweet Child O' Mine, You Could Be Mine). Even back then Axl's voice appears to be severly strained (sometimes he sounds like he has razor blades stuck in his throat).

* Other reviewers complain that the band lacked energy and the crowd was rather flat. While I'd say that the band seemed pretty energised to me, I'd love to know why out of all the concerts they could have chosen to record, they picked Tokyo (where the locals are pretty passive by nature).

All in all I'd say that the concert is very, very good but the DVD production could have been better. I would gladly have paid top dollar to be at that concert.

Finally, to all the people complaining that the concert was sold on 2 seperate DVD's, think of it this way, I spent $60 ($30 each disc) for a concert I can enjoy over and over again. Sounds like pretty good value to me.",1149638400,,2952,4.419889502762431
489565,4,6302643449,"Contrary to several of these reviews, I personally think this is a great Live DVD of Guns n' Roses, offering a very solid performance on their Illusion World Tour. Far superior to the Illusion 2 DVD, this shows GNR playing classic ""Appetite"" songs with great rock fierce, as well as doing several cuts from Illusion albums and rocking out in all of them.

The show kicks off with an electrifying performance of ""Nightrain"", and the band is on the mark, with good lyrical deliveries from Axl and a good solo. ""Live And Let Die"" is also an excellent performance with the band in good sound. ""Mr. Brownstone"" and ""It's So Easy"" are heavy Appetite tracks performed with great intensity, the latter being the better of the 2 performances. Axl gives an awesome delivery for ""It's So Easy"" at the end. I consider ""Bad Obsession"" to be the worst performance on here, but it is okay. Duff McKagan pioneers ""Attitude"" giving the vocals. ""Pretty Tied Up"" has some great moments with Slash shining on the guitar, and Dizzy Reed's background piano sounding perfect in this song. It drags on too long though. Gilby Clarke (Izzy Stradlin's replacement for the remaineder of the tour) and Slash perform ""Wild Horses"" by Rolling Stones. ""Double Talkin' Jive"" is pure fiery rock, with the whole band jamming for a good minute before gearing into the track. ""Don't Cry"" is a very nice performance, with the transition from Slash's guitar to Axl's voice sounding sensational. ""Civil War"" is one of the heaviest performances in the set and the guitar riffs are exceptional. ""Patience"" is definitely one of my favourite performances on here, and was probably Axl's best performance of the night. ""November Rain"" closes out very well, and Axl begins it with a 3 minute piano impromptu.

Overall, this is in my opinion a very solid performance from the band, however simply would not appeal to casual fans of GNR. This is specifically for diehards only. You really have to appreciate the pure raspiness of Axl's voice and the ugly playing of the group to enjoy this DVD. Recommended to big fans of the group.",1143676800,8,2084,4.802228412256268
489566,1,6302643449,"OK, I am definitely a GNR fan.  But Geez, this is cheesy.  I can look past the Nigel Tufnel Shorts with the ""armadillos in our trousers"" look.  I'm totally impressed with the Richard Simmons-esque running about the stage that Axl Does - I'd be pretty damned out of breath too if I tried it.  Too bad I'd be forgetting my primary job, which would be singing.  I can look past all of that.  It's a great set list, great setting.  It's even filmed pretty decently, with camera men and an editor who don't need Ritalin.  Overall, I think the band puts on a pretty damn good performance.

My biggest gripe is the sound.  It sounds like an audience recording.  Worse, it sounds like someone recorded it from a nearby high rise (Tokyo has a lot of those) on their chicklet-sized cell phone.  After about eight transfers, it made it onto DVD.  Come on, the only soundtrack is Dolby Stereo?  From 1992?  Gimme a break!  I have The Who, Black Sabbath, and Marshall Tucker DVDs from a decade and a half before that are in 5.1.  This DVD had me checking all my wiring and the power to my subwoofer to see if everything was OK.  Wanna know what the sound on this DVD is like?  Go wear a pair of earmuffs and sit in your car and listen to the audio CD.

I guess for [...] bucks I can't complain TOO much.  It's just SO frustrating considering how good and enjoyable this could have been were it recorded properly.

--Edit-- What are you fanboys not getting?  Shooting the messenger is the best you can do?  Let me restate this again for those who are too slow to understand.  I love GNR!  But if you buy this DVD (and I'm NOT saying not to), be ready to be disappointed by the sound quality.  Not the performance of the band.  The band was awesome!  The peformance was awesome!  The video was great.  But the sound engineer needs to be shot. That doesn't mean that Axl didn't hit his notes, or that Slash's guitar was out of tune.  It means that the company putting this DVD together didn't care enough to do an even half-way decent job.  We don't get to hear what the audience got to hear, not by a long shot.  If you don't demand better and voice your own displeasure, then you get what you deserve.
Caveat - if you listen to this DVD through your TV speakers, please ignore this criticism.  This was made for you.  Rock on.",1128643200,5,2312,4.3076923076923075
489567,3,6302643449,"I was very glad to see a Guns N' Roses concert DVD come out. We all know how GN'R have been left in ruins,and it is always nice when an old band releases DVDS of them in concerts. This is a direct transfer from an original VHS tape that was released in 1992,and the producer of this DVD did a pretty good job at transferring the original VHS performance to DVD.

The DVD itself? Could have been a little better,but not bad. A little dull at times,but the good parts are really good. There are no bonus interviews on this DVD,but you do see an introduction that is behind the scenes before the actual concert starts and a couple behind the scenes looks after a performance. Good work there. The performances of ""Nightrain"",""Mr. Brownstone"",a cover of the Paul McCartney/Wings classic ""Live and Let Die"",""Attitude""(a Misfits cover),and ""Patience"" are a little bit boring,but performances of songs like ""It's So Easy"",""Welcome To The Jungle"",""Don't Cry"",""Double Talkin' Jive"",""Pretty Tied Up"",""November Rain"",and ""Civil War"" are all really good good performances. Axl Rose shows off his talent as a showman during the performances of ""It's So Easy"" and ""Civil War"",and ""Double Talkin' Jive"" leading into ""Civil War"" sounds(as well as looks) just plain awesome. Don't expect the crowd in this DVD to keep up the excitement during performances of songs on here(some of which are on Guns N' Roses' ""Live Era"" record),and while this DVD would have been better if the crowd acted excited,the DVD itself is still alright. Don't expect to see ""Sweet Child O' Mine"",""You Could Be Mine"",etc. performed live,but a DVD that shows Guns N' Roses supporting UYI2 in Japan was also released,so buying that DVD along with this one would be a good supplement to this DVD(and both of them are sort of Guns N' Roses greatest hits--hits and fan favorites--live and in concert on a DVD). The best thing about this DVD is that even though the special feautures do pop up right after a performance of a song before you see the next song that is performed,you can go to the menu,click on the song selection,and then pick the performance of the song that comes up right after the performance of the last song you saw,and then you don't have all that much to complain about. An improvement from the original VHS release that came out in 1992.

Become a die hard Guns N' Roses fan before you purchase this DVD,but despite it's faults,this is a decent DVD. I recommend getting it cheap and used,but except for the weak parts of this DVD,this is a good purchase for die hard Guns N' Roses fans.",1127260800,5,2562,4.755056179775281
489568,2,6302643449,"Hey, I'll be one of many to state that "" Guns and Roses"" revitalized rock and roll. I absolutely applaud and cherish a couple of their albums; however, this DVD is boring - absolutely boring. I became more concerned with whether or not the washer was on the spin or rinse cycle.

It took me several listens to get through this travesty. Seriously, this performance is that boring. I'll be so petty as to say,"" What the hell, Axyl? What were you thinking, when you and the band released this bull crap? You and those damn shorts. You were just so damn cute.""

Bad asses of rock and roll? You failed here.

The sound is flat. The performance is flat. I just didn't care. Maybe, just maybe, if you were all performing in some dive bar, I would have bought you a beer; then again,( I'm still being petty), I would have thought you were a wimp and had laughed at you.

Its so Easy is one of my favorite on the DVD along with Bad Obsession. Attitude is a great song unlike most GNR songs becouse its a misfits cover that Duff sings but it is really good. Pretty tied up is my least favorite song on the DVD, but still not bad. Welcome to The Jungle you gotta have its excellent. Axl sings Dont Cry perfectly here. Double Talkin Jive is another great song. Civil War is pretty good, Alot of changing in one song even for Axl.  Slash and Gilby start soloing at the end of Civil War and it carries over into Wild Horses witch is mostly guitar and really good. Then Patience thats awesome I prefer Slashs original solo to the one in this version but still excellent. And Finally November Rain probably the best GNR performance. The DVD is Excellent no need for bonus features go get it!",1092355200,6,959,4.35754189944134

489661,2,6302643449,"WEAK. That sums up this offering. Visually its an OK show to watch. Sound quality is also just OK. Performance wise...very flat. Perhaps it was the notoriously reserved Japanese crowd that failed to draw the best out of the Gunners on this occasion. Its a shame they could not have recorded a US show where the crowds are more upbeat(or flat out insane)in many cases and may have possibly elicited more energy from the band. Whatever the case...this show,sadly,has very little edge and is in fact sloppy and boring in too many spots. Many bands have done it right...AC/DC,RUSH and STEVE VAI are examples of outstanding,tight live shows caught on DVD...this one is NOT.",1079136000,10,668,4.868421052631579
489662,2,6302643449,"This is a combination review of both UYI's, and the ""Welcome to the Videos"" DVD.  I did not previously have any of these on VHS.  First of all, the music itself.  Of course the videos are classics, and it's great to finally have them on DVD.  The glaring omission is ""You Could Be Mine"", which is a shame since it is a great song and video.  They must not have wanted to pay to license the Terminator image for this release, which isn't surprising given the other shortcomings.  I'll get to those in a minute.  As far as the Tokyo concert goes, it's not bad, but it's not great either.  I saw GNR twice back in the day, and even saw them again with the new lineup in late 2002 before the tour was aborted, and ALL of those shows had at least twice the energy of this one.  The show I saw in the Tacoma Dome in 1991 was VERY intense, and to this day is still the loudest concert I have ever been to.  The show on these DVD's just doesn't compare, but unfortunately this is probably all we are going to get of Axl and Slash era GNR.
As far as the DVD's themselves go, I am VERY disappointed.  I think the entire concert and the videos could have been put on one DVD, like the Stone Temple Pilots did, or at least onto one reasonably priced 2-disc set, like the OUTSTANDING Led Zeppelin DVD.  They didn't even bother to remaster any of it in 5.1.  The whole thing smacks of a money grab to me, and that pisses me off.  If Jimmy Page could do such an awesome job of remastering tapes from the 1970's in 5.1, there is no reason they could not have done the same with these.  The other thing I hate is when concert DVD's are constantly interrupted by interviews, which completely breaks the mood of the show.  Save the interviews for the special features section, dammit!!!!
So if you gotta have your GNR then go ahead and get these, because that's all you're gonna get.  It's just very disappointing that no effort was put into the production, and that this was all released on 3 separate DVD's to maximize the amount of money that they could extract from your wallet.  Hats off again to Jimmy Page for thinking about the fans instead of his bank account, and if you don't have that Zeppelin DVD then GET IT NOW!  IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!",1078876800,8,2235,4.253554502369668
489663,5,6302643449,"Weither you are a guns n roses fan or not, you would have to admit that this dvd is everything a live dvd should be.  Everything is raw and uncut, just as if you were in the crowd watching the band. You actually get to watch the show as it was, not how they want you to see it.  Recorded live shows like these really show the actuall quality of the band, you actually get to hear the band itself instead of some studio crap thats been produced and cut till its perfect.  The GnR performance is excellent.  A must have dvd for any hard rock fan thats interested in watching an actual show of one of the best rock bands ever!  Dont forget about the Use your Illusion 2 dvd!  You need that one as well to complete this live masterpiece!",1078617600,2,733,4.126760563380282
489664,3,6302643449,"This is about the closest many of us will get to revisiting this era of the band.  Gilby Clarke does a formidable job in deputizing for the great Izzy Stradlin and the boys blow away the lucky Japanese who witnessed this live back in 1992.  Visually the video is impressive with some wicked angles and good editing.  The band's performance itself is energetic and an all out, balls to the wall assault.  Alas the audio element leaves a LOT to be desired.  In many instances the balance is off or the volume fades unexpectantly.  One would have expected this particular aspect to be stellar on the dvd but alas it merely serves to ruin the experience of some of the tunes.  Still, Gunner fans who don't already own the VHS version, will enjoy themselves.  Grade: B.",1069459200,,764,4.5661764705882355

489666,5,6302643449,"First off, if you are going to get this tape, you might as well get the second too.  It just wouldn't make sense to do otherwise.  Secondly, if you really want it on DVD, check e-bay.  They released the DVDs in other countries and that's how I got mine (although the writing on the case and in the menu is Spanish, it's not hard to figure out).  With that said, if you like Guns N' Roses and want to see them live on video, buy this DVD set.  The band plays a number of songs off of the Use Your Illusion albums, and also a few of their biggest hits from the Appetite for Destruction album.  The video quality is spectacular and the audio quality is great for what you would expect from a live recording.  Of course the quality is not perfect, I don't have any complaints with it.  It's a concert recording, what do you expect?  In fact, the only complaint I have is having to see Axl wearing those small spandex shorts the whole time.  Why doesn't he put any pants on?  Well anyways... just get the videos.  I figure if you came to Amazon to find videos for Guns N' Roses, you are slightly interested.  This is a great live set, so just do yourself a favor and buy it.",1056412800,18,1169,4.165178571428571

I was lucky enough to see them a few times back then, and can tell you they are one of the greatest rock bands live EVER!
If they could have stuck around longer, they would have gone down in history as big as the Stones or Led Zep.
Make sure to get part 2 or this tape, it's the 2nd half of the same concert - it was silly not to sell them together.",1008201600,,459,3.7422680412371134
