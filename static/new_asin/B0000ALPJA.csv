This musical DVD of the ""oldies"" in Nursery Rhymes will captivate both you and your dear little ones!  My grandson begs me to run it again and again.....which I do gladly on those days when my ""get-up-and-go-has-gone!""

You'll find yourself going through the motions, humming the tunes, eager to play it again just for your own enjoyment and sense of peace.  Don't wait! Order it to enjoy NOW!
