8625088,5,B00GNIFHZ6,The Engineering Mechanics Statics Tutor DVD is clearly presented and explained at the basic level. I was confused in my physics mechanics class at college. But this DVD answered all my questions. I just wish a Volume 2 for Engineering Mechanics was available from Jason.,1442448000,,270,5.022222222222222
