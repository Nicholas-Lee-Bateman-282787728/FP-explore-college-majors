As so, it's also a great entry in the pantheon of what can be truly classified as 'Horror-Porn'. It's also got a few bucks behind it, so it's not insulting like watching a Misty Mundae flick (can someone tell me how she got to be popular?) or most of the Retro-Seduction releases that fail on multiple levels simultaneously.  'Fantom Seducer' is a hardcore remake of the erotic horror film 'Fantom Killer', so don't confuse them. They're both directed by Roman Nowicki, and I think they're from Poland, but with an entirely new cast. The story is thin but interesting (remember, we don't watch them 'cause they're deep), the sex scenes profound, the actresses appealing and some of the sets are quite cool. The horror element is there, but we don't drown in it.  This is the director's extended cut, plus there are 8 trailers for similiar releases, 1 hour of extras, behind the scenes, bonus sex scenes - almost 4 hours of material. If you like this genre, you need to catch this one, you too will be seduced by the Fantom...",1278374400,4,1174,4.559241706161138
