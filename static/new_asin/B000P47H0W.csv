I am not disappointed in my purchase and I am now the proud owner of a personal hard copy of one of the legendary master-classes videos.
Segovia himself plays only one piece -- given that this is a video of master-classes in which the students' performances are the focal point. As the students render their pieces -- in what to the untrained ear and eye appear to be impeccable performances -- they are constructively criticised and corrected in the inimitable style of Andres Segovia.
We also see Segovia in the role of examiner -- with a team of other experts. In this session the maestro only listens attentively, without intervening or commenting, while the competitors perform. Afterwards the winner of the competition is announced and he proudly walks away as his cherished reward -- handed over to him by Segovia himself -- with a guitar built by the craftsman Ramirez no less.
One cannot help to feel on behalf of the students that it was an honour for them to have had the opportunity to be under the patronage of the great master for such a brief history in time. Their respect for Andres Segovia is palpable throughout as they embrace the suggestions given to them in an attempt to perfect their performances. Likewise, one can feel that Segovia, through nurturing the talents of his students in these master-classes, was advancing his own dream of making the guitar a major concert instrument.",1310688000,,1674,4.736301369863014
