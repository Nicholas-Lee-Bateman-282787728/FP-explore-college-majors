8681791,3,B00O33PBXG,"...as the title says! For bicyclists who own an older bike and want to know the basics about maintenance and minor repairs without needing too many specialized tools, this video is OK- go for it. The Copyright date is 1979; shown is a road bike from that era. So don't expect modern components or a crisp-sharp HD picture quality; this was made in ""early"" VHS days. But the sound is good, and every word understandable.
Those in search of more comprehensive, advanced repair procedures on modern components better skip this, and look for more up-to-date material. (And yes, there is plenty of stuff on YouTube, but I still appreciate popping a DVD in my machine, and leaning back to watch it sans WIFI dependence... I am ""Old School"" as well, LOL).",1450569600,,748,4.717557251908397
8681792,5,B00O33PBXG,A very good DIY type of the product that caters to the need of repairing the bicycle by self. Though a small issue but many times we are stuck for time to get the things done by others. The mechanics are also difficult to get for such small jobs. It will be costly and time consuming. The DVD can be helpful to bicycle owners and also the dads who have the challenge to repair the bicycle of their children.,1427673600,,407,4.1645569620253164
8681793,5,B00O33PBXG,"Bicycles are such an expensive investment, and like everybody else, I hate paying more than I have to. Its worth it to simply buy this rather than paying someone else to complete such an easy task. Have some faith in yourself! If you take a short amount of time to educate yourself on this, youll see it pay off, especially if you have kids constantly jumping on and off of their bikes or crashing them into everything in sight. Surprisingly, you can even make a few bucks on the side by adjusting and tuning bikes if you're into that sort of thing. This has been so helpful. It got the job done quickly, which is what mattered to me.",1412467200,,634,4.336134453781512
