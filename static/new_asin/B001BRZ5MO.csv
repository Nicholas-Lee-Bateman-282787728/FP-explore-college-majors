3497839,5,B001BRZ5MO,My 2yr old loves this show. It teaches about social interactions as well as the animals featured. It is also very low on the mommy irritation scale unlike some other shows. I wish that they had more of these shows available.,1297036800,,224,4.487804878048781
3497840,5,B001BRZ5MO,Mama Mirabelle videos are a great alternative to mindless cartoons. My daughter loves to learn about the new animals. I definitely recommend Mama Mirabelle.,1282089600,,156,5.541666666666667
3497841,5,B001BRZ5MO,"As a producer of children's videos, and as a father, I'm particular about content for children. This teaches children about animals, working together as a team, the worth of the individual, and appreciating differences. Each story introduces an animal and brings out a truth that can set a child free. Each character has an accent from a different part of the world. Great concept by producers. Considering how this country is split by the right and the left, this is a healthy middle that educates, informs, and in ways inspires. If only adults were like animals...what an adventure that would be!",1266796800,,598,4.930693069306931
3497842,5,B001BRZ5MO,"My 2.5 year old son absolutely loves this DVD. Even his little brother (8 months) enjoys watching it. It's educational and a good mix of cartoon and live footage. It's also nice that each episode is only about 15 minutes. That way I can allow him to watch the video for shorter segments, without having to interrupt in the middle of an episode.",1235952000,3,344,4.476190476190476
3497843,5,B001BRZ5MO,"It is great that my 3 year old daughter loves Mama Mirabelle's Home Movies, but even better that my husband and I love it too.  Mama is enjoyable, intellegent and is not one of those kid videos that makes you cringe.  A great way for you and your children to learn new and intersting facts about animals and their habitats.  Mama also teaches the importance of caring for all creatures on our planet and how living things depend on each other for survival.",1227398400,2,456,4.469879518072289
3497844,5,B001BRZ5MO,"Great short movies for small kids, and very informative too. My 5-year old daughter enjoyes this DVD very much.",1225411200,2,111,4.894736842105263
8284313,4,B001BRZ5MO,"The kids love this! This is pre- Wild Kratts, so the animal video sections are more cutesy than educational. It's a worthy kid mind candy show. It's fun and cute.",1447718400,,162,4.433333333333334
8284314,1,B001BRZ5MO,"I'm sure this is great, but I was never able to get it to play.  I tried the computer, iPad, and Amazon TV with no luck no matter what I did.  I haven't encountered this problem in the past, so it seems specific to this particular purchase to me, but I could be wrong.",1427155200,,268,3.9444444444444446
8284315,5,B001BRZ5MO,My 3 year old son LOVES this show.  We have both of the DVDs and we wish all of the episodes were available on DVD.,1425945600,,115,3.6

8284317,5,B001BRZ5MO,This was a great series that not only was fun for the boys to watch but educational. We need to order it again as I can't find ours! Highly recommend.,1372464000,,150,4.033333333333333
8284318,5,B001BRZ5MO,"Excellent viewing for pre-schoolers, in convenient format, teaching essential skills for social interaction.  Appealing characters, guaranteed to be watched often, so value for money!",1357257600,,183,6.625
8284319,5,B001BRZ5MO,"My 3YO loves loves loves this DVD!! If you're not familiar with Mama Mirabelle, it's an entertaining (and educational) show about the differences in the animal kingdom, and how each species is special in their own way, as well as the regular pre-school stuff (cooperation, teamwork, etc). Mama (an elephant) has a son, Max, who plays with his friends Bo (a cheetah), and Karla (a zebra). Whenever the segment for home movies (live footage of animals) begins, my 2YO runs to the TV to join his brother. This DVD has six episodes as well as two bonus episodes:

*Tales of the Galapagos - We hear the story of how Glennis the tortoise from Galapagos became friends with Mama Mirabelle

*Elephant Walk - Mama makes Max feel better about not being able to do all the things he wants to do yet, and how independence comes along with time and is different for everyone

*Travels with Mama - We learn about Mama's travels to Australia and her first encounter with an echidna

*Footprints in the Sand - Max, Bo and Karla stumble upon a giant footprint, and watch home movies where they identify many different types of footprints to figure out who made the giant one

*Curtain Up! - The kids decide to put on a talent show...so we learn all the different kinds of talents different animals have

*Take Me To The Water - Mama's friend Jacques the Walrus is visiting, but the kids are not impressed...until they see what Jacques can do in the water

BONUS episodes:
Super Duper Savanna Animals
Anybody Home?",1315872000,2,1496,4.643939393939394
8284320,5,B001BRZ5MO,"My 4-year-old loves this. The animal characters are fun (Carla the enthusiastic British zebra is my favorite), and they add a cool kid-friendly wrapper for the wildlife footage from National Geographic. Mama Mirabelle presents animal facts that help bring up emotional issues that are common for kids of this age. For example, there is one about wanting not to be so little, anxiety around a new baby coming, etc. This show is very well done, and super educational while entertaining.",1311984000,2,484,5.0625
8284321,5,B001BRZ5MO,"I bought one Mama Mirabelle episode to show my grandson when he stayed over one night; he wanted to watch it again, so I bought the whole season. I enjoyed them as well when I saw the appealing combination of animation and real footage of animals in the wild. Mama Mirabelle's Home Movies is almost the quality of Magic School Bus. Needless repetition as each ""home movie"" is introduced keeps me from rating it more highly, but as my eight-year-old grandson concluded, ""These are fun to watch AND I'm learning cool stuff about animals, and even about me!""",1301529600,,555,4.673469387755102
