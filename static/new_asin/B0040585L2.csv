4239035,1,B0040585L2,I wasted a prime click on this flick and five minutes in turned it off.  This is one of the worst C- movies I've ever watched five minutes of.,1389916800,,142,3.896551724137931
4239036,2,B0040585L2,Didn't make sense to me. Couldn't finish the movie. I don't believe I made it half way through.  Every one has their own taste.  I enjoy hard core horror movies and B movies to a certain degree but it has to make sense and this didn't for me.,1389830400,,242,4.020833333333333
4239037,1,B0040585L2,"the acting was very bad, the I didn't watch the entire move that is how bad it was! Very Bad!",1389139200,2,93,3.7
4239038,1,B0040585L2,"i like a good horror flick now and again, and i even dig on B movies, but really, i got through the first 2 minutes of screen time and had to stop. didn't even make it to the opening credits i am generally down with f-bombs, but this just seemed like someone's chance to see how many curse words they could cram into a script so make it seem like a ""real movie"". (12 in the 2 minutes i watched)

then i decided that id at least give it a fair shake, and sat unflinchingly through the rest of this cinematic travesty.

the graphics reminded me of 1984, the weird camera angles and odd close ups didn't add anything useful, softcore porn 15 mins in was not impressive and only confused me, i have serious doubts that all the products placed in the film were there with permission really? rite aid, coors, and guinness agreed to have their names associated with THIS?? the acting was terrible, the script was ridiculous, the effects were only moderately cool, the foley was just silly, and over all it made no sense. wouldnt show this to the kids, but thats the mentality level were dealing with here. i don't want to be completely negative about everything as i know SOMEone worked really hard on this and is probably very proud of the result. im trying really hard to find a good thing to say about this nope. cant do it. sorry..",1388361600,13,1328,4.372469635627531
4239039,1,B0040585L2,"It seems distributors of grade-Z low budget crap have now found ANOTHER way to sell their product:  on any ""read"" teaser, list what will SEEM to make an interesting story, lure them in by rating the product ""NR""--that way the viewer will think by the title and rating he/she is going to be treated to an over-the-top-something-or-other--, put some interesting artwork on your CD casing, and viola`, you've made your money.  Such is the case for this piece of garbage.

I will not go into very much detail about this movie because...I turned it OFF after 15 minutes.  But when the ""couple"" came to the hotel and found the person behind the counter having sex with a stuffed animal (not to mention showing the ""outcome""), that was enough for me.  And anyone who thinks this ""actor"" was relishing in his part, well, I'll just say I'm glad you don't have a vote to cast for the Oscars.

Absolutely garbage and if there were any way I could get my money back (watched on PPV) I would.",1374969600,4,979,4.534090909090909
4239040,3,B0040585L2,"Before I start this review, I must state that this film is a low-budget anthology.  Some of my readers have expressed an instant dislike for low-budget horror flicks, so if this is you, feel free to stop reading now.  But if you are like me and enjoy the creativity and determination that smaller films can bring, please continue on.  ROAD HELL, while far from perfect, is a mildly entertaining jaunt that many people will enjoy.

The vision that these three filmmakers had in mind when they started putting ROAD HELL together is not very evident in the execution of the film, but thankfully it is still fun to watch for the most part.  I like the premise, how the primary story is accented with the other three tales.  And some of the acting is pretty good, too, although much of it does leave a lot to be desired.

ROAD HELL is shot pretty well overall and looks good for the most part.  It is definitely low budget and that is reinforced with spotty sound and low-lit scenes.  But the production crew does a heck of a job with what they have to work with.

The special effects are both hit and miss.  The hits come from the gore.  I am impressed with some of the carnage the special effects team was able to conjure up.  But the misses come from the second segment where a tiger is involved.  The practical effects for the tiger look like a joke and the CG portion reminds me of early Nintendo days.  I have to confess that when the tiger was revealed, my interest in the story was almost completely lost.

But don't watch ROAD HELL for the special effects...instead, watch it for the colorful characters.  Granted, the acting is very bad in many cases, but there are a couple of folks that shine through, including John Link who portrays the warped hotel owner Dickey Sussex.  Link does a great job with his role and relishes every minute of it.  For a guy whose IMDB page reads like a B-grade porn movie checklist, Link shows a lot of talent in this one.

ROAD HELL will certainly not be for everyone, but I kinda liked it.  It's not perfect, but look past its shortcomings and you might just have a good time.  The film hits store shelves next week.",1373328000,,2155,4.416243654822335
4239041,1,B0040585L2,"I watched it all - every excruciating, cringe-worthy moment. I never did figure out what was supposed to be going on. There was no plot. There was a lot of bathroom ""humor,"" some gore, and not much else. I suppose it's supposed to be funny. But it's not. It might be a hit with a group of thirteen year-old boys. A group of immature thirteen year-old boys. I mean a group of boys that's even more immature than normal thirteen year-old boys. Otherwise my recommendation is to skip it completely.",1458691200,,495,4.511111111111111

4239049,3,B0040585L2,"Plain and simple.  It started out cheesy, but kept getting better as movie went on.  Don't expect top notch special effects from this movie.

Horrid, but not in a good way like the old 50's horror/sci-fi flicks, which were terrible, but fun to watch. Reminiscent of a John Waters piece of crap. I generally watch a movie all the way through whether I'm liking it or not, just for the sake of finishing something I started. Not this time! Got a few minutes into the first ""tale"" and couldn't take another second of the moronic drivel. Now I have to dig through Amazon's extensive selection of outdated, obscure, really crappy, horror movies in order to find something else to watch.

4239065,2,B0040585L2,"This is bad! I don't recommend watching this unless you're SUPER bored ha! (As I was) I Love Horror Anthologies so I stuck with it, b/c sometimes there is indeed a hidden gem. But this just goes too far (or not far enough) on all aspects. The acting, storylines, and CGI/prosthetic effects are extremely bad. They just use the common horror stories/ideas and do a horrible job with all of them. There is a little nudity as well, Of Course! Not saying thats a bad thing Haha! But seriously, again like I said they use every clich of horror movies from the 80s and early 90s in here, but in a way thats already stale and over used. And sometimes that can be funny, but everyone involved in this movie, actors, producers, etc. just don't know what they're doing. I still give it two stars as it COULD be worse... but I definitely wouldnt watch it again unless I wanted to torture a friend and make fun of it while watching, even so... not sure if thatd even be worth it. HA! Id Pass on this if I were you, but then again sometimes you just have to see it for yourself you know? Gives you something to talk about if anything, lol!",1396137600,,1126,4.291079812206573
