Intro: 5 min
Lucy talking at the beach & other close by nature, other nice places, moderate production values, lovely nature landscape, good sound from her mic. The music is very soothing, something most would use to put you to sleep which it did me. The history of yoga, touching on some of the names of different types & a lot on how it's good for your health/body.
Dawn Breathing:  5 min
Lucy sitting at the beach, breathing in 1 nostril a while, then the other only. The alternating nostril. Also slowly builds the teaching of the breath of fire.
Sun Salutations: 5 min
At the beach, Lucy in voice over, first time is slow, then another fast power speed, then 2x more fast with her telling you when to inhale/exhale...
Hatha Yoga: 27 min
Lucy in voice over. After getting all warmed up, you are now to lay down & do simple leg 90 degree stretch, both legs at 90 (no crunches), plow to shoulder stand, knee to chest stretch, single leg locust, normal locust 2x w/rest in between, sphinx (easy version of cobra), cobra, rest, bow, knees to gluts, bow again, seated popular spinal twist with knee to ribs, child's pose, fists resting in abs to massage organs while in child's pose, camel, mountain w/deep breathing, simple raised arm stretch while standing & again on toes, standing side torso bend, very modified tree, tree, stand & breathe
Meditation: 5 min
At the beach, she guides you to remind you to relax individual muscles, etc. usual stuff.
Chant Meditation: 2 min
She chants Om & in voice over she tells you what Om means & about keeping in the moment to let thoughts drift & use breath to anchor the spirit.

She really has a slow, relaxing, sleep inducing pace, she's careful/slow with movement/overly gentle speaking. This is good for extreme beginners or those with low endurance. She tells about using blocks & gives a lot of ""don't do a shoulder stand if you have neck issues, etc."" For single leg lifts, she gives the modified first w/other knee bent, then ""advanced"" which is the usual way all other workout dvds do with other leg straight.",1199404800,3,2318,4.678921568627451
