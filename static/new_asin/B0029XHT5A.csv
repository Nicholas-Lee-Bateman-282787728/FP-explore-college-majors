3882313,5,B0029XHT5A,"This is a remarkable artifact from an era when to be a man meant having respect for women, keeping your word, standing up for what's right and a thousand other qualities which are now politically incorrect but were once the hallmark of being a grown-up. This is the perfect audio-visual companion to James Bowman's Honor: A History.

Each episode has a lesson illustrating how a man should act and ends with a prayer by Walter Brennan that his grandson learn the lesson. Walter Brennan was one of the great character actors in Hollywood history and Guns is the perfect vehicle for his acting skills. Terrific guest stars and well written scripts round out the series, making this a television classic.

UPDATE: SEPTEMBER 3, 2011
I wrote that review after seeing the first one or two discs. Now that I've watched all six discs, I stand by it as much now as I did when I wrote it, but I've noticed something even more profound about this series.

We know that many TV shows in the 1960s were more profound than they appeared on the surface. The producer of Gilligan's Island has said that the show was about democracy and scholarly books have been written to support that.

In addition to providing lessons of manhood, The Guns of Will Sonnet is about myths and history and their role in our personal growth. The choice of actors is perfect. Walter Brennan was a legend himself in Hollywood by the late 1960s, having become an actor shortly after he returned as a doughboy from World War I. Dack Rambo, who played Jeff has such deference to Brennan that the viewer completely believes that he is Brennan's grandson. For an actor who doesn't appear to have had a long career, he is terrific here.

Jim Sonnet, son of Will and father of Jeff, represents the legends of the Old West. Will, the old man who has lived his life in the Old West, seeks Jim the way an old man searches history to validate and confirm his own life. Meanwhile, Jeff, the young man, looks for the legends of the Old West as a model for living his life. In a couple of episodes, Will states flatly that one should rely on his own character not on myths and peers.

Throughout their quest for the Legend (Jim), they find fruads claiming to be Jim, claiming to have killed Jim, they meet old friends of Will who disappoint and losers who pull themselves out of their rut by force of personal character. There is a rather extraordinary depth to this series. Too bad there is nothing like this on television today.",1309392000,32,2479,4.547085201793722
3882314,5,B0029XHT5A,I used to watch the show when I was younger and kind of forgotten about it over the years.

I purchased the Guns of Will Sonnet on Tuesday and got it on Friday.  My husband and I watched all day on Saturday and all day on Sunday, and I must say that I loved Walter Brennan and Dack Rambo in this western series.  I wish they would have made a movie.  I don't really remember this tv series when I was a child, but I would have loved to have seen it before now.  When I tell you it was one of the best westerns that I have watched, it was superb, ""NO BRAG JUST FACT""!!!

3882337,5,B0029XHT5A,Walter Brennan is brillant in this early western.  He portrays the grandfather who guides his grandson in search of Will Sonnett's son.  The son who you don't see until half way thru the series is known as a gunfighter.  The son is hated by some and respected by others depending the town.  Will Sonnett is a God fearing man who prays at the end of each show asking God to help find his son.  I truely loved this old western and highly recommend it to Walter Brennan fans.  He makes you believe in justice and the right way of life.,1438041600,,532,4.27

3882342,5,B0029XHT5A,Great series that brings back a lot of memories.  This set has a few problems quality wise but is to be expected given how old it is.  I read a lot of reviews of the old series and wonder why they are compared to the same quality of things being filmed today  These films are a part of out Television history and we should be happy to have them.  Given that there are no western shows being made these days we should appreciate those that we have.  If you could buy a great show like this one on Blu-ray how more would it cost?  Could you afford to purchase it?  Anyway I'm happy with set and my only wish is for it to have closed captions.,1421366400,,640,4.031746031746032

This show is exceptionally good. Produced by Danny Thomas and Aaron Spelling. This was a pretty intense series for Mr Spelling as we are used to his lighter fare like ""Charlie's Angels"".
It's  like a good book. You can't put it down. Once you have read one chapter you can't wait to read the next. It's plot is very similar to ""The Fugitive"" and I loved that series. There is plenty of action here for all western fans. Do they find him alive in the end or is he never found? The answer lies in the last bonus feature. An episode I think that was never aired in it's original run and that's why it's listed as a bonus.
Not having seen this show when it first appeared I feel I have to mention that it looks to have been edited from 25 minutes down to 21 minutes. If it has that's a pity. Then I would have to give it 4 stars instead of 5. But I highly recommend this series.

3882375,3,B0029XHT5A,"This is a great show, and the video quality's decent for a program of this vintage... the only problem is, the shows are short.  Half-hour TV shows from this time period usually run around 25 minutes, and the episodes in this set are around 21 minutes each.  In a few I've watched there are noticeable jumps in the narrative, where something was obviously cut out.  So it looks like Timeless got ahold of versions that had been chopped for modern broadcast, and to fit more commercials in several minutes of each episode got chopped out.  That may be the only versions still available, though - I've bought a lot of Timeless discs and they usually do the best they can with vintage material.

It's still a set that's very-much worth getting, because the show is excellent... I just thought buyers should be aware that they're edited versions first, just to avoid disappointment.  (Five stars for the show itself, two taken off for the edited versions)",1345507200,29,951,4.733333333333333

And....GASP...the star of the show could offer a heartfelt PRAYER at the end of each episode!!!!!!!  There is no way they would make this show today, much to our loss.

Just wanted to say I really like the show and the picture, sound, and editing of the commercials was done great.  I also got the complete Branded series.  So far with this one it has exceeded what I thought the quality of the dvd's would look like based on the reviews.

I hesitated buying these for a while because of some of the negative things I read in the reviews, but am glad I got them.  I don't notice any issues.

Also thanks for the previous reviews for giving me some help on purchasing the dvd set.

I was curious and wanted to see it for myself and after finding it on Amazon.com I purchased the complete two season set. I was not disappointed at all from the show or the quality of the dvd's.
 It is a must see for any western tv fan.",1315094400,,328,3.9696969696969697

Great acting, and stories narrated by Walter Brennen, ending with prayer of thanks to God! Wow, Where are the actors, writers and producers like this today? We desparately need them!",1312848000,3,339,5.181818181818182
3882390,5,B0029XHT5A,"Remembering when, my favorite tv western, remembering the anticipation of seeing the action, gunplay, that every kid imagines the old west to be, I'll wait no longer, ""The Guns Of Will Sonnett"" is here on this six disc box set covering seasons 1 & 2, the show aired 1967-1969 and ran for only two seasons, not a very long span for a television series starring the great Walter Brennan, who is just simply amazing from episode to episode... it seems some of the best westerns for tv never lasted, and yet still remained popular, ""Rifleman"", ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" etc... the transfers and audio are good enough, some lines and imperfections are apparent throughout, where else will you find this classic on video. The packaging consist of three thin cases holding two disc securely per case and inserted into the cardboard cover... some special features include a short documentary on Walter Brennan's film career and the guest stars who appeared on the show. The Guns Of Will Sonnett, not to be forgotten, not to be missed... buy this now while it's still available. timeless media",1312416000,4,1081,4.848648648648648

I was so excited to find this great show on DVD that I bought the complete series for myself and my son who is in college, he loves this series too. Thanks to Timeless Media for bringing this wonderful show to DVD. Great family friendly entertainment!",1311379200,16,403,4.315789473684211
