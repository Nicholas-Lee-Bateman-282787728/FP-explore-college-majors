Being lucky enough to work in radio, I did some research and was able to meet and become friends with John (the writer/director) and Damon (the producer).  Believe me, there were even more stories that did not make the movie that one day need to be told.
I have had the pleasure to do many promotions involving Blur.  Everyone who I have shown the movie to agrees that not only is the movie genius on its own merit, it is also THE most honest tale of REAL college life that has ever been produced.  I consider myself fortunate simply to own a copy of this film!!

This movie is one of the funniest college films to come out in recent years. It's a darker look at college life as five friends cheat their way to a 4.0 their sophmore year while doing nothing more than doing drugs and shooting things ... and the occasional kidnapping.
It's based on stuff that actually happened in the life of the director/writer, which makes it that much funnier. The DVD is full of extra features that add to the insanity, such as the Helen Keller version of the movie, and a documentary of actual footage of the people the movie is based on.
The perfect movie to watch during a night of drinking with friends, it makes everyone else's life seem a little more normal.",1021248000,4,691,4.492063492063492
1711701,5,B0000665TL,"Blur of Insanity is a slice of life movie that follows a circle of friends throughout their various exploits, most of which stem from boredom.  It's very much in the same vein as Kevin Smith's movies, particularly ""Clerks"".  From setting matchbox cars on fire and elaborate schemes for cheating on college exams to a romp in a whore house massage parlor - this movie has it all.  The best part is that like Smith's movies, many of the characters are based on actual people.  In fact, the DVD includes a great documentary featuring a number of the ""real"" people's exploits.  Despite the vast number of rehashed teen and college movies that have been coming out in the past few years, I still found this movie to be as refreshing as it was entertaining.",1020729600,3,751,4.616541353383458
1711702,5,B0000665TL,"I bought this DVD on the advice of friends and was not disappointed.  It chronicles the adventures of 5 friends in their sophomore year in college.  Throw in a good mix of alcohol and other sordid substances, firearms, a cabin in the woods, fireworks and, oh yes, a Magic 8-Ball and you've got the makings of one hysterical movie.
Ah, if only college was like that when I went.",1019433600,,377,4.449275362318841
1711703,5,B0000665TL,"...or how I fooled my parents into spending a lot of money so I could be a degenerate. This film has underground cult status written all over it. Far superior to the milk toast coming of age fair we have been tortured by for years, this movie pulls no punches. It is difficult to describe the misadventures of the five primary characters....suffice it to say a number of laws of state, nature, and morality are grossly violated. Unlike the usual streotype's, the characters are true to life. It's impossible to watch them and not thnik, ""I knew a guy just like that!"" This is a very funny film, punctuated by moments of brilliance.",1018828800,3,631,4.592920353982301

7961889,5,B0000665TL,Great movie. Good indie flick with great production values. I cannot recommend this movie enough.,1414454400,,97,5.533333333333333
7961890,5,B0000665TL,"Makes me realize that I wasted my time in college studying and going to classes. This is what I should have done, and who I should have done it with! Great film!",1413936000,,161,4.0625
7961891,1,B0000665TL,"One of the worst movies ever made.

Even though I fast forwarded through most of the scenes, I still want back my time.  Its not clever, original or amusing.  Protracted scenes, self-worship, self-glorification and worst of all, trying to hard to be cool.  This film meet the definition of a bad movie and for those of you who cant see through it or are giving this 5 stars, heres a hint: this is redneck humor appealing to the lowest common denominator.  A stain on the country.",1392508800,,479,4.523255813953488
7961892,2,B0000665TL,"One day, I stumbled upon the Blur's website and read some of there articles. There are a few good ones, but mostly it's filler. It really just serves as a marketing ploy so you buy there crappy movie.  So anyway, I decided to order this movie thinking it would be a movie with a lot of jokes and humor in...Sort of like ""Animal House"" or even ""Van Wilder."" You know something with an engaging story and a cast of colorful, funny, engaging characters, and something that actually set on a college campus? (There are like 3 scenes in the whole movie shot in a class room or showing a college) In reality, it feels like you're watching an old episode of ""Pete and Pete"" from Nickelodeon except you wouldn't want to erase the memory of seeing ""Pete and Pete"" from your memory. For instance, everything is bland and the story movies REAL slow. All the characters are bland and really only 2 of the 5 main characters stand out. The other 3 are just filler and are totally replaceable. There no stand out laugh out loud moments in this film or anything awesome you can quote from this movie. The dialogue is slow, boring, and pointless. Sometimes while watching this movie, you may even wonder if the film's creators just kept making things up on the spot and filming them to have an almost full story.

  One day I wrote this website and told them a story about one of my teachers and how I was a fan of their work. They liked my letter and were supposed to send me a t-shirt and hat but never did and then they ignored my further emails. REALLY PROFESSIONAL!!! Don't support people who screw over their fans. Never forget, people in entertainment work for us! There is a reason this movie was an independent release and not a theatrical release. If this were a major release, it would be up there with ""Troll 2"" or ""Quest for the Mighty Sword"" and by the time it would hit store shelves, it would be marked for a buck and sent straight to the clearance rack.",1253145600,2,1953,4.401662049861496
7961893,2,B0000665TL,"I'm a 19 year old student. I bought this movie on the recommendation of all previous reviews and I was very disappointed. I found the jokes to be predictable, the actors dull and not funny (I only laughed once), and the plot disjointed. Also, although this wasn't really a problem for me, I don't think it looks like a big-budget studio film at all. Buy this movie and you may be disappointed.",1152230400,3,393,4.472222222222222
7961894,5,B0000665TL,"This was a very big suprise. I love the website, and the movie was OUTSTANDING. If you are thinking of buying the Blur of Insanity, I HIGHLY recommend you do so. Hilarious, and great trip scenes. Buy this movie. You won't regret it. Peace.",1072310400,2,239,4.454545454545454
7961895,4,B0000665TL,"Blur of Insanity was a great movie. I just graduated college a few years ago and it brought back some awesome memories. A little darker and deeper than most ""college"" movies, it certainly wasn't your typical stoner movie. Lots of great quotes and scenes that young people could relate to.",1034726400,3,288,4.78
7961896,5,B0000665TL,"What can I say about this movie that the pope didn't cover at world youth day?  It rocks!  I still am curious as to how an independent film can be so professional looking.  Funny, well acted, great screen work, and so many great lines that you will be quoting it for life.  Please buy this film!
Ah, there's nothing like being totally loaded
and writing movie reviews.",1029196800,4,368,4.447761194029851
