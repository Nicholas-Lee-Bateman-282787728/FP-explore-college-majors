1783152,5,B00006JU7Z,"Recorded in Dallas, Texas in 2002, this live DVD finds Superjoint Ritual doing what they do best: pure, unadulturated underground metal style mayhem.  The picture quality is crisp and clean, and while the audio mix may be a bit raw, it definitely adds to the overall package of this live set.  The only real drawback is lead vocalist Phil Anselmo seems to be pretty intoxicated during the performance, and while seeing him stumbling and rambling around might take away from the greatness of this DVD, he still manages to belt out some insane vocals.  I recently attended a live show in Philadelphia featuring Superjoint, Morbid Angel, and Devil Driver, and I must say what is captured on this DVD is nothing compared to being right there in person.  All in all, this DVD is a must own for any Superjoint fan, but I strongly suggest checking them out live in person for an awesome metal experience.  The DVD also includes the music videos for ""The Alcoholik"" and ""F*** Your Enemy"".",1069459200,7,980,4.741176470588235
1783153,4,B00006JU7Z,"This DvD is awesome but don't be excited for ""backstage interviews"" because i fell there wasn't enough of that and they should have put the bit that they did have in the menu selection, but other than that it is a very cool DvD and i suggest only buying it if your a Superjoint fan or a Philip Anselmo fan.",1042502400,,306,4.116666666666666
1783154,5,B00006JU7Z,"I really liked this dvd, totally honest. If you own the Superjoint cd and like it, You will dig this! The 2 videos are fun in a underground sort a way. Support Heavy Metal!!!",1035072000,2,174,4.147058823529412
1783155,5,B00006JU7Z,"This is an essential purchase for fans of Superjoint Ritual and Phil Anselmo. The sound and picture quality are top notch, and the mix itself is very raw and violent sounding. The band is really fired up and energetic, but I think being in a club setting cramps their members too tightly as they don't move around much (I may just be way too used to seeing Phil and Pantera jump around going crazy). There are plenty of good shots and some funny moments, especially when the cameraman is afraid to get close to Anselmo. The song selection is great, though I would have liked to see them open with the instrumental opener from the cd, Oblivious Maximus. All in all though, I cant complain: the disc is well filmed and put together, and the music is great!",1033084800,7,754,4.471014492753623

7970857,5,B00006JU7Z,"Alright if you are reading this you are familiar with Superjoint so im gonna keep it sweet and simple. This dvd is a live concert  of the Joint smoking their asses off ! It was a hardcore show with bodies getting smashed in pits and some of the hardest headbanging of Hank 3 on bass. His neck should be broken but luckily not,some insane show seriously everyone was on point. They played pretty much the whole album of Use Once. Great crowd,Phil's voice was perfect as always,really screaming his ass off. It is brutal and beautiful,you really gotta love the intensity,and the heavyness of those killer chords. If you like the band you will want to pick this up. Also if you get the chance pick up the Superjoint live CBGB dvd(Ihave that as well,reviewed it and highly recommend it.) Great stuff,so go buy it !",1355270400,,810,4.5479452054794525
7970858,5,B00006JU7Z,"Great Dvd a must buy for any old Pantera fan who wants to see what the frontman is up to as of somewhat recent. Buy it!!,.,. Plus Great Camera footage,, angle shots!! all the way Heavy freakin; metal hah Peep the obnoxiousness is Phils stage presence<>",1162684800,,252,4.5
7970859,3,B00006JU7Z,"I read the review on this dvd and thought i'd be stupid not to buy it. However i was pretty dissapointed by it. Dont get me wrong. Superjoint are amazing but compared to the second (CBGB) dvd, this one just doesnt give you what you want. I know it came out before the other one but it just doesnt have the atmosphere. First off, the camera work is really annoying. It flashes continuously to make it look like the venue is packed but you can see its pretty empty so you don't get a vibe from it, also it tries to go with the music and that gets pretty annoying too. Still the perfomance is great, and unlike the other review i think phil's voice is up to scratch. The little features of the band are cool but take away from the gig because they are just stuck in between songs. On the other dvd you get to see more of the band and you get a better selection of songs, and phils rants between songs are pretty heart warming whereas the ones on here are a bit stupid. Overall, you just don't get a good vibe from the gig and its not up close and personal like the CBGB performance.",1143763200,,1079,4.118483412322274
7970860,5,B00006JU7Z,I'm jealous cause all the music concerts always be live in big cities like Dallas Texas. No concert ever come's to small towns like mine which is called Winnsboro. It's just boring.,1143072000,,181,4.6875
7970861,5,B00006JU7Z,"What a great DVD this is. I have yet to buy a Superjoint Ritual album, but after seeing this i definitely will be getting my hands on at least one of the two, or possibly both. I got this DVD as a gift for my birthday at the start of this year, and after watching it i was that impressed. I was kicking myself for not already owning their albums. Phil Anselmo's vocals are way more harsh than anything he did in Pantera, and although i wouldn't go as far to say that the music is way heavier than Pantera, it's at the very least equal in that respect..just alot thrashier, and alot faster. In almost every single song too, it slows down either halfway, or in the chorus, to a chugging riff that is absolute mosh-material.

On this DVD you get a full concert. The camera-work is great. The full set-list is as follows, for those who would like to know..

1. It Takes No Guts

2. The Alcoholik

3. F**k Your Enemy

4. Everyone Hates Everyone

5. 4 Songs (..I'm not sure exactly if this is actually one full song or 4 short songs, but there are short breaks inbetween that make me think that it's the latter of the two..)

6. Drug Your Love

7. Haunted / Hated

8. Anti-faith

9. Ozena (Possibly my favorite song on here..)

10. Starvation Trip

11. Superjoint Ritual (Possibly my second favorite song on here..Phil's throat must hurt afterwards..)

The extras here feature 2 videos.. ""F**k Your Enemy"", and the pretty amusing ""The Alcoholik"". All up, the full concert goes for just over an hour. And let me tell you, it just does not get boring. Every single song has at least one highlight in it. The whole crowd really get into the mayhem too..footage here and there of the crowd show the moshpit, and people pushing into eachother etc, etc. In and out of most of the songs, there are also interviews with each member. But don't expect 10 minute interviews or anything..they're sort of a letdown, because they go for around 3 or 4 minutes at the most. But at least it keeps the energy and intensity of the concert alive, in a way, if you know what i mean. The interviews alone are pretty interesting. Also, Phil Anselmo introduces each song as they go..making the crowd roar with approval each time.

So basically, this is easily a must-have for fans of Superjoint Ritual. I also think it's a must-have for fans of any of the band members too, because in my case..never having heard anything by Superjoint Ritual..this still paid off bigtime, probably because i'm already a pretty big fan of Phil Anselmo and of Jimmy Bower too. And whatever they seem to touch turns to gold, in my opinion. This DVD is an easy 5/5.

On a side note..i can't wait to hear new material from Down. I hear a new album is being written as we speak.",1126828800,,2726,4.413173652694611
7970862,5,B00006JU7Z,"you won't find the raw energy and intensity that you'll see here on any other dvd out there.  phil puts on a one of a kind show and it's captured here.  this man is the god of metal, and NOBODY will regret buying this dvd.  buy it.",1098316800,,231,3.872340425531915
7970863,5,B00006JU7Z,Superjoint Ritual is the heaviest Phil's band ever. You must buy this DVD to see how those guys play REAL HEAVY METAL out there. I hope they will continue to write music this way. This is the best type of metalcore I've ever heard. Listen to SUPERJOINT RITUAL!!! Satan bless you all!!!,1097280000,,285,4.5
7970864,5,B00006JU7Z,"Superjoint shows that pure metal is not dead it is alive and killing all who oppose. Phil is a metal god and poet of the underworld.  This dvd is sick and twisted and only for those true with metal. This, just like their albums packs a punch and kicks you in the face and to the ground.  Rock on and Headbang forever.",1074124800,3,317,4.096774193548387
