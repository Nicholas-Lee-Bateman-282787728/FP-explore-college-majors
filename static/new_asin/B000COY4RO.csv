2467685,5,B000COY4RO,My daughter and I watched this the other day when it was on the Hallmark Channel.  We really liked the movie.  Too bad this isn't available on DVD.  It is worth watching.,1251676800,,170,4.25
2467686,4,B000COY4RO,"I loved the message, the script (what I could understand), the music, the set...the plot development....But Why oh Why didn't the director insist that Anne Heche didn't run her words together...Her facial expressions and movements were beautiful but I had to rewind and re-listen to many of her lines...and it's not that she lacked the ability...In the interviews, she had perfect diction...It was like watching a beautiful paintind upon which someone had spilled a couple of drops of catsup...I still highly recommend the movie....",1250208000,,532,5.345238095238095
2467687,5,B000COY4RO,"Having a loss of a loved one makes Christmas emotional and a struggle.  Suffering with the loss of relationship between parent/child or man/woman is just as great a loss and struggle. Christmas brings the loss back, but sometimes with HOPE. This Hallmark Hall of Fame story, taken from the novel by Lauanne Rice, is such a story of loss and hope, of loss and struggle, of loss and the miracle of recovery. That is also what Christmas is.  Christmas is about finding ""Silver Bells"" in life when life's path is difficult.

It doesn't take a Christmas tree farmer to discover hope.  Can Christy?  Christy Byrne is the macho but lovable tree farmer with two children, trying to hide his struggle after losing his wife by her death.  Along the journey into the street of New York City, to sell his trees, with the help of his son and daughter, they all encounter others, each with a need, a loss, a relationship needing hope.

It is a love story, made delightful through the written words of best-selling author Luanne Rice.  It is also a hope story made perfect by Hallmark, who never fails to product ""the very best.""

My wife and I LOVE this movie. It is one for us to watch each year. We relate to it passionately because we have each lost a spouse, and survived, and found the hope, and eventual recovery, including our marriage to each other.  We have found our own ""Silver Bells"" in our silver years.",1234137600,28,1402,4.549800796812749
2467688,4,B000COY4RO,I do not own this own but I remember watching it on TV. This is not a light frothy Christmas romance. It has a romantic element but in fact is deeper- a serious look at both loss and love. It has some uneven moments but was well acted and on the whole well done.,1207612800,8,262,3.8703703703703702
2467689,3,B000COY4RO,"'Silver Bells' is a Hallmark Production made for television movie which is available for purchase only at Hallmark stores.

It's a story about two people who have lost their soul mates by unfortunate deaths and are afraid to try again. Christy Bryne (Tate Donovan) makes the journey from Nova Scotia every year with his two children to sell Christmas trees on the streets of New York. Despite his remakable talent for selling trees to all that pass by he has never been able to sell one to the recluse young blonde who works across the street from his tree stand. As you might guess Christy makes it his goal to sell a tree this year to the unapproachable Catherine (Anne Heche).

Meanwhile his oldest son is ready to move on and leave his old life in Nova Scotia and runs away from his Father to seek a career in photography in New York. Catherine happens to run a photo gallery and encourages the young man to pursue his dream. Between helping the son and fighting off the advances of the father things diffently get complicated and emotions run rampant.

However as you might have guessed by now eventually everything works out when Christy returns the following year and true love is discovered just in time for Christmas!",1134777600,37,1226,4.640552995391705

2467695,4,B000COY4RO,"This is one of my favorite Hallmark Christmas movies, one which doesn't seem to show up in the repeats every year, as much as some others do.
There is a sense of loss as both main characters have lost a spouse and find the holidays difficult.  The father is slow to realize his son doesn't want to raise Christmas trees and has a talent for photography. The boy takes off on his own when they are in the city, causing the Father and daughter much worry.  The art lady befriends the boy and helps him to survive.
I loved the compassion and warmth that grew with the story plot. Also, loved the architectural emphasis on the photos the boy was taking of places people fail to see in their rushed city lives.",1484524800,,705,4.333333333333333

2467724,4,B000COY4RO,"Silver Bells is a delightful Christmas movie about adults and kids finding their way to life's next phase.  The script is fairly tight except for the teenage boy.  Anne Heche is very good playing her role delicately.  Tate Dovovan plays is role well and only occasionally does the script create soft spots.  It is enjoyable to own and watch every Christmas season to remind us to look at life as some one else does so we can be a positive force for them.  The great gifts we can give are personal, in families and with friends.",1444953600,,527,4.447916666666667

2467790,4,B000COY4RO,"Another excellent Hallmark Christmas movie to add to your library. I am continually impressed with the number of superb family movies that Hallmark makes each year. This story takes place in New York where a dysfunctional family is trying to find a way to make amends and put others before themselves. A wonderful cast, great story, excellent scenery and sets, and impeccable directing make it one for the Christmas list and at least a yearly viewing during the holidays.

2467791,5,B000COY4RO,"Very good movie, it's a Hallmark made for TV. Was happy to find it so I can watch it whenever I want. Good movie about two people who have both lost someone & they are both kind of cynical. They find each other but it isn't sappy.",1324512000,,230,3.9148936170212765

2467795,5,B000COY4RO,"Silver Bells is a nice family movie for Christmastime of year.  It's about a young teen boy who wants to be a photographer and a father who wants him to be part of the family business (a christmas tree farm).  There are terrific scenes in the beginning of what is supposed to be Nova Scotia and then of course, NY, NY where most of the movie takes place.

If you're looking for a nice story that can be shared with the whole family, this is it.",1293408000,,444,4.1395348837209305
2467796,5,B000COY4RO,"I have watched this movie over and over again, because it is so good. The plot is great and the story plot is about a man with a son and daughter who had lost their mom and they are Pine tree farmers, and they go to NY every year to sell their trees for Christmas. Well, the son does not want to take on the father's business but is interested in Photography. He runs away and a lady who works in the art museum helps him get a job, in the mean time this beautiful blonde starts falling in love with this boys father. It becomes quite a plot, and you will just have to see it. The best part is where the silver bells are at the very end of the story. :-)
Wonderful family Christmas movie. Would recommend to all my friends.",1291593600,,723,4.027777777777778

2467799,2,B000COY4RO,"I do not own a copy but also saw this on the ""Hallmark Channel"" and had a hard time staying with the slowness of the story.

Tho I like things truly romantic I found this weak in length of th courtship part of the storyline and for most part weakness on the son leaving home ending in all is well.

Wouldn't recommend or buy it!",1260144000,,328,4.030769230769231
