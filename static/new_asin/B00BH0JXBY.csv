8568357,5,B00BH0JXBY,"It's too much fun! If you are a fan, though, you should start with Dabangg. Salman Khan's character, Officer Chubuil Pandey, is a completely over-the-top badass. The songs by Khan and Sinokshi Sinha are memorable, and Kareena Kapoor sizzles in her item number, ""Fevicol"", as usual. The opening number, Dabanng, is worth the price of admission, especially if you've seen Dabanng and know Officer Pandey. It's hilarious. Is the movie unrealistic, especially when you consider how many times the characters break into song throughout the movie? Yes, and thank Shiva. This is Bollywood, baby, and long may it continue. Even if you're not a Masala fan, see this movie. You will not be sorry and who knows, you might find a refreshing alternative to the crap Hollywood keeps churning out. Yes, you will have to read subtitles unless you speak Hindi and no, I don't. I'm not even Indian, just love Bollywood films.",1372464000,,907,4.934640522875817
