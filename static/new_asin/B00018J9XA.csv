8007884,5,B00018J9XA,"I started dancing about 4 1/2 years ago, and have spent a small fortune on dance lessons.  Since I come from a teaching family, and also got my teaching certification, I know how to recognize good teaching -- and I expect to receive it when I invest time and money for a class.  Unfortunately, there are lot of good dancers who are not also good teachers.

So I am delighted to report that these two instructors are excellent! And so is the quality of their DVD.  While a lot of class descriptions (for both live workshops and DVDs) state that the teachers will break down the steps, these two really do! Slowly.  So you can see what they're doing, while they explain WHY they're doing it, and give tips to remember. I learn best when only 2 or 3 moves are introduced at a time, and then are repeated at least 3 times, and then added to other moves. And this is how Yee and Mertz teach.  They are very patient and encouraging.  I felt as though I were getting a private lesson.

Also, since I now have 4+ years of experience as a dance student, I want to point out that they emphasize all the important aspects of partner dancing (such as connection, balance, weight distribution, lead-follow relationship, etc.) which become critical to incorporate if you wish to progress past Beginner status.

I recommend these teachers and this DVD without reservation.

Another DVD I've had a good experience with is the Shawn Trautman instruction for West Coast Swing.  There's a long opening sequence that's annoying, and the music is cheesy, but his instruction is good and the picture-in-picture illustrations are very helpful.",1361404800,3,1620,4.689045936395759
8007885,4,B00018J9XA,"I learned east coast (6 count) swing in ballroom classes years ago and have danced more or less for decades.  The challenge of moving fully to Lindy Hop (8 count) is not to be underestimated because although 6 count swing is considered beginning Lindy Hop by it's purists it is quite a leap to arrive there.  This product is a nice bridge into the dance and will acquaint you with the basic few patterns.  Although there are only a few lessons here you will be wise to learn these few intimately before moving to the next tape.  Hey, while you're learning mix some of your 6 count into your practices as well.  Dancing's about having fun!",1202515200,2,638,4.4655172413793105
8007886,1,B00018J9XA,"This DVD is boring and not helpful.  The ""instructors"" have no pep at all.  Don't buy this dvd.",1155945600,2,95,4.222222222222222
8007887,5,B00018J9XA,"The whole series (though Vol 3 is called ""Introduction to Lindy Hop"" compared to 1 and 2 which reference ""Swing"") is excellent.  We thought we had the fundamentals and even intermediate points of swing pretty well off - and we did - but we got a lot of ""fine tuning"" out of this series.  Some GREAT really clearly illustrated stuff on subtle hand signalling, great camera angles to illustrate what is going and good comentary will all improve your footwork, body position, leading and following.  We also got some new moves which on the East Coast USA were new to folks around here and expanded our repertoire.

If you are beginners - this series is probably the best illustrated and paced we have seen.  If you can't get an instructor locally then this is a good start and will get you putting on a great swing routine pretty quickly.

The series of DVD's really build on the previous ones - so take them in order, push back the furniture and dance with your DVD remote in your hand.  They really lend to track back and slow motion play if you want to see what is going on!",1123718400,18,1074,4.4213197969543145
