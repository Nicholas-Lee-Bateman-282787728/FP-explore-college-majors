7915128,5,B000021Y1D,"Bladie Flowness is a master of movement, music, and teaching. One of the first things he does on this tape is to put on his skates while standing to demonstrate the kind of control that can be achieved with practice. This in itself is a profound demonstration, because while extremely simple it's a ""move"" that would impress very few unless they knew how difficult it is. It's what Bladie strives for, to teach and learn the control first, then the show-stopping moves will take care of themselves. Being a tape, it lacks the one-on-one dialog you can get from Bladie in free lessons he teaches in Central Park, but what strikes me as so beautiful about his teaching style both in person and on tape is how encouraging he is. For example, he says that even after a session where you struggle, during the rest period in between sessions you continue to learn because you have a ""board of directors"" in your head that discuss among themselves what you are trying to do. What a wonderfully colorful and encouraging way to explain what psychologists call integration! And even though he doesn't teach it on the tape, he demonstrates a bit of tai chi on skates, a concept that is so profound it opens up infinite possibilities of movement. As far as one of the other reviewers mentioning laughing at him, my take is that Bladie is such a true performer that performance has become his life. What spiritually higher reaction can a performer evoke than laughter? On top of that, you'll learn enough control on skates to express yourself any way you want, even if that means to go on and take lessons from teachers who teach moves. If you think you already have the moves, go back to Bladie's concepts, because they'll probably make your moves better and at the least give you a new way of thinking about them. Included in the video are some clips of Bladie's past performances on British television. I highly recommend this tape for anyone interested in roller dancing,",1117411200,,1962,4.673410404624278
7915129,5,B000021Y1D,"I met Bladie in Central Park and he told about his video.  First, I laughed at him but then realized just how much he was having and how much joy that was bringing to everyone around him.  Even if you don't want to learn anything about Blading - the video is worth the money to laugh at  bladie alone.  You should see his bike,  This man is ridiuclous, but very  talented and almost therapuetic!",945820800,3,395,4.27027027027027
