8375673,5,B002NY7YWI,"Very lovely.  These concerts start in the afternoon and end after dark.  The transition from daylight to night is always spectacular and one of my favorite moments of every Waldbuhne Concert.  It was clearly hot the evening of the concert; both audience, conductor and performers showed significant sweat during the camera closeups.  The color was excellent.  The sound was also very good.  Daniel Barenboim's performance of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No 1 was sublime.",1467590400,,473,5.324324324324325

8375676,5,B002NY7YWI,"St. Petersburg Night from June 1997 is one of my favorite Waldbuhne concerts by the Berlin Philharmonic. Led by Zubin Mehta, the outdoor concert features music by Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Prokofiev. Two complete works are featured: Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto #1 with Daniel Barenboim on piano and Rimsky-Korsakov's Capriccio Espanol. This is a great way to watch a classical concert.",1265155200,12,421,5.806451612903226
