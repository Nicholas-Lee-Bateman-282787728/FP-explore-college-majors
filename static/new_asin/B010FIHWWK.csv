7310629,5,B010FIHWWK,A good epilogue! The whole series was terrific - both because of the gripping stories and the French language practice.,1504051200,,119,5.0
7310630,5,B010FIHWWK,"I watch a lot of WWII series &a movies. First series from the French point of view.
Enjoyed it very much. I thought that being in French, with English subtitles, added
to the realistic feel of the series. Highly recommend for fans of this genre.",1501891200,2,245,4.466666666666667
7310631,3,B010FIHWWK,"Seasons 1-4 are the strongest for this series. Season 5 went off the rails a bit; too many coincidences to manipulate the storyline as some of the more annoying characters were given too much airtime. Season 6 focuses on the characters' shame and anxieties in the aftermath of living with war for so long. Very depressing so far. The storylines dragged and wasted time. Writing this review in July 2017 - I've heard rumors that there are still 6 final episodes to come. If so, I hope the writers have put more effort into the storylines, giving the remaining characters something to ""live"" for as they complete the series.",1501372800,2,622,4.715596330275229
7310632,5,B010FIHWWK,"My husband and I have loved the French Village, one of our all-time favorite series. Season 6 is the finale and ties up most of the loose ends in the early days after the War II ends. I won't say any spoilers here about the plot, but long time watchers will enjoy the irony of it. I highly recommend the series, but, of course, begin with Season 1.",1500508800,5,348,4.132352941176471
7310633,3,B010FIHWWK,"After going through five seasons and now as we enter Season 6 the war is over, I'm bored. I lasted an episode and a half. Too many flashbacks through those episodes. Too much courtroom drama and politics. Beriot System B beard makes him look like the Most Interesting Man In The World and I half expected him to be doing a beer commercial to make ends meet. Never was really interested in the Antoine storyline although it did get better in Season 5. Hortense looks as though she's gone loopy looney tunes nutso and I already couldn't deal with her wide-eyed acting method. Honestly, I'm thinking they're just milking this as there are actually only six episodes vs. the 12 we got in seasons prior.

Anyway, I just think they could have stopped after Season 5 and been done with it. It was pretty satisfactory in my books. Just way too many good and evil characters I cared about are now dead and gone.",1500422400,,902,4.5
7310634,5,B010FIHWWK,One of the best TV series ever. This really is reality TV though the French would not be happy to look at their role in WWII.,1498262400,,125,3.8461538461538463
7310635,5,B010FIHWWK,"We thoroughly enjoyed all 6 seasons....what fabulous insights into the history of that time. Making decisions that would have such far reaching results....choosing to do the ""right"" thing makes one think about how difficult it must have been to act on decisions that were made.....truly a spellbinding view of life under siege during WWll.  Where is Season 7?",1497139200,,359,5.189655172413793
7310636,5,B010FIHWWK,"I've watched all 6 seasons of A FRENCH VILLAGE, and can categorically state that it is one of the most engaging and informative historical series ever produced.  By turns a thriller, soap opera, and history lesson, it informs even as it entertains. The actors are well cast, and many will be familiar to aficionados of French TV series seen on NETFLIX like SPIRAL, or THE RETURNED. Set in the period just after war's end, Season 6 explores the fate of the surviving characters with the same clear-eyed intensity of the previous war torn episodes. (I watched in French with English subtitles.) Highly recommended!",1496016000,6,612,4.941747572815534

7310638,5,B010FIHWWK,"Excellent acting and script...as relevant today as it is historically accurate.  A complicated, nuanced story from the first season to the sixth.",1495152000,,145,5.590909090909091
7310639,5,B010FIHWWK,Very popular with the patrons,1494806400,,29,5.0
7310640,5,B010FIHWWK,This season was as good as the previous seasons and we're hoping it won't take too long to get the newest French Village dvd with English subtitles!!,1494201600,5,149,4.555555555555555
7310641,5,B010FIHWWK,"I've watched the entire series, and it is really well done. It makes you think about how you would have acted if you had lived in a small village that ended up being occupied by the opposition during WWII. No one in the series is completely perfect and they all do things that are questionable, sometimes for more selfish motives and other times to help others. There is a lot of ""grey area"" here and you really do have to consider what the appropriate reaction would be given the circumstances. Even the German officers go against what they are told to do and work with some of the French people. Many movies/TV shows set during WWII are often fairly black and white - this one shows a lot of the grey and shows the difficult situations people were placed in, on both sides, and the choices they had to make because of it.",1494115200,6,823,4.38562091503268
7310642,4,B010FIHWWK,"Ok, but not as good as previous seasons. Basically an epilogue covering all or most of the characters remaining alive.",1494115200,2,118,4.95
7310643,5,B010FIHWWK,"A well made, captivating series. It is riveting.",1492560000,,48,5.125
7310644,5,B010FIHWWK,"A fine and deeply considered conclusion to a sometimes uneven series. [ (1) if there can ever be a genuine conclusion to events as horrific as those which took place during the second world war and (2) i'm thinking about the seemingly endless play-within-a-play that unfolded in the forest in an earlier series, as the Resistance focused on casting and staging a drama while the Nazis went about their work pretty much unimpeded. ]

At turns more lyrical, more poetic, more artful and more deliberate than the preceding series, 6 also features some wonderfully considered cinematography. Just take note of the manner in which many key scenes physically and visually separate the characters; split by doorways, halls, windows, bars, street level to basement, or the screen of the confessional, we are constantly reminded not of peace, but of the divisions brought to the surface by war's end.

Deeply affecting, and largely unflinching, 6 is the drama of history finding its best expression. Not to imply 1-5 are not worth your time and money. The cumulative effect is not unlike what Luis Bunuel achieved at the end of Tristana: the torrent of realizations, nightmares and years of abuse compressed into a few crippling moments.",1492128000,12,1228,5.044334975369458
7310645,5,B010FIHWWK,great series,1491350400,,12,5.5
7310646,3,B010FIHWWK,"This conclusion could have been more encouraging. By the end, everybody is miserable or dead. After all, we know by now that France recovered fully, actually becoming one of the wealthiest, more cultured, and industrialized democracies in the world. The script writers forgot that this is France we were talking about.",1489363200,3,318,5.254901960784314
7310647,5,B010FIHWWK,This was absolutely fabulous! Very moving...  especially at the end. One of my all time favorite series.,1489104000,8,104,5.117647058823529

8722312,5,B010FIHWWK,Exceptionally good TV series. I have watched all 7 seasons now and can't rate this highly enough. Seriously good TV!,1520467200,,116,4.85

8722315,4,B010FIHWWK,A great series that kind of let us down a bit in the end. I guess that trying to stay true to history doesn't make for the best know out punch.  It would have been nice to see some of the baddies get their comeuppance and not just disappear or get a slap on the wrist.,1513036800,,268,3.7857142857142856
8722316,5,B010FIHWWK,"Having watched all 65 episodes (seven seasons, although the 7th series isn't available yet on DVD), I'm overwhelmed by how the scriptwriters not only confronted French viewers with all the gray areas involving their parents or grandparents' collaboration with the Nazis during the time of the Vichy government but also created such complex characters that we sometimes find ourselves booing and hissing the alleged ""good guys"" and cheering some characters who have behaved in an abominable fashion. But then, the ""good guys"" can turn out to be more evil than we supposed, and some ""bad guys"" can readily accept responsibility for all their actions, no matter how monstrous. Some of the most corrupt characters are also the most pragmatic survivors.

Those who stick with the series until the end had better get their hankies ready for the final, completely heart-wrenching two episodes.

The actors are uniformly exceptional in this ensemble cast of hundreds. Most of all, I will never forget Nicolas Gob as Jean Marchetti, a French cop who obeys every command involving the rounding up of Jews or Communists for execution and deportation until he falls for a Jewish woman, Rita (Axel Maricq). But by then, he has acquired the nickname, ""Butcher of Villeneuve.""

Then there are Robin Renucci and Audrey Fleurot as Dr. Daniel and Hortense Larcher. Dr. Larcher finds himself unwillingly thrust into the position of town mayor whose scruples are compromised one by one until he finds himself compiling death lists with another official, Servier (Cyril Couton), to quench the Nazi thirst for blood in retaliation for Resistance violence done to them, an action that will later have dire repercussions for both men. As for Hortense Larcher, she finds herself attracted to a Nazi leader, Heinrich Muller (Richard Sammel) and is ready to forgive his every sadistic cruelty.

Then there's Lucienne (Marie Kremer), a schoolteacher who falls for a handsome German soldier, Kurt (Samuel Theis) but when he's about to be transferred to the Russian front and she finds herself pregnant, she agrees to marry the the headmaster, Briot (Franois Loriquet), who is willing to adopt her child as his own.

Finally, there are the major Resistance fighters: Larcher's brother, Marcel (Fabrizio Rongione) and his mistress, Suzanne (Constance Doll); and Marie (Nade Dieu), a farmer's wife, who is involved with the married owner of a sawmill, Raymond Schwartz (Thierry Godard), who initially is apolitical and gladly sells his product to the Nazis, but ultimately joins the Resistance. Then there's the young Resistance fighter Antoine (Martin Loizillon), who shamefully is forced to leave four buddies behind to be slaughtered by Nazi troops. Finally, there is Schwartz's wife, Jeannine (Emmanuelle Bach) who is determined to survive and prosper, no matter who rules the country.

For me, this is the finest, most engrossing series I've seen since the Spanish ""Gran Hotel.""",1508630400,4,2951,5.241525423728813
8722317,5,B010FIHWWK,"Haven't watched it yet, but have seen several episodes on pbs and the were very good. Bought 3 and 6 to fill out our set.",1506729600,,121,3.88
8722318,5,B010FIHWWK,"What a great series.  Need to watch all 7 seasons in order.  Lots of twists & turns and really provides an indication of what people under wartime occupation must endure in order to survive.  Good characters, well acted.  Subtitles do not detract from enjoyment and in fact helped me follow the dialogue.",1506384000,5,304,4.788461538461538
