8483657,5,B005QROFLC,"SHRIEK OF THE MUTILATED (aka: SCREAM OF THE SNOWBEAST- 1974) opens w/ a lovely decapitation, while something fuzzy watches from the bush. The scene shifts to a college classroom, where a discussion of all things yeti is underway. Dr. Ernst Prell (Alan Brock) is taking some of his students out to his rustic lodge. But first, ""the popcorn song"" plays at a very grooooovy party, where a man named Spencer Ste. Claire (Tom Grail) bellows on in hyperbolic fashion, about his terrible experience w/ Prell! About ""That beast!"" ""That abomination!"". His loony performance is a maniacal prelude to what mutton-headed madness is to come! Spencer goes completely berserk, which leads to attempted homicide, and his own comeuppance through toaster-in-the-tub electrocution! After this interlude, the students are off to meet up w/ Dr. Prell, in his remote abode, via flower-stickered hippie van. Prell introduces the students to the pony-tailed Dr. Karl Werner. We are also introduced to the grunting, shirtless, leering handyman, Laughing Crow! His appearance is a wonder of non-acting! Dr. Werner opines about his encounter w/ Sasquatch. Next day, they're off to the deep woods. Thankfully, Tom (Jack Neubeck), the crankiest of the students, is slaughtered by a hairy beast in tennis shoes! Then, Lynn (Darcy Brown) and her gargantuan, hexagonal glasses, fills the forest w/ her howls! The big ""twist"" finale is both inane and insane! SOTM hits every mark -and more- on the ultra-schlock chart! Acting and dialogue that can only be described as some sort of aimless rooting and mewling. A plot, obviously written -mostly- while the camera rolled. An absurdity factor rivaling old mondo films! Karen's (Jennifer Stock) idiot screaming is a miracle of ululation, usually reserved for holy roller meetings or warring chimpanzees! Nope, it doesn't get much better / worse than this, folks! Extra stars for the ""Dinner fork attack"" sequence! Bravo! Encore! Author! Authorrrr!!!...",1505692800,,1966,5.30448717948718
8483658,1,B005QROFLC,"Without a doubt, one of the most ineptly-made movies I have ever seen. Yet, there was something about it where I watched it through until the end. I certainly did so for laughs and eye-rolling. The actors were either complete wooden duds or they seemed like the hams of their local amateur theatre groups. Nearly every opportunity for suspense is fumbled by talky scenes, poor framing, dreadful acting... ugh. I'll say this, if you're one of the folks looking for assurance that Sinister's is a version featuring the original music track of ""Popcorn""; it is. The popcorn SEEN in that sequence is THE most unappetizing, grimy mess I have EVER laid eyes on. It's not burnt, so, I can't figure out why it's so GRIMY looking. And then there's the use of classical music for the rest of the score. Laughably bad. (except for one sequence near the end that actually works at setting a mood) SHRIEK certainly does have one of the best horror film titles ever. AND, in my opinion, one of THE best (and well-deserved) uses of an electrical appliance in a movie. And then there's the dinner scene near the end- which has to be seen and heard to be believed. How the actor kept a straight face considering what he had to say to the guests is beyond me. I think this would work best if you're watching it with a few other horror buffs with (a) senses of humor, (b) beer, and (c) something to occupy your attentions during the really dull bits, like knitting or cutting coupons or something. Also, I found it sort of charming that the print is in such TERRIBLE shape, but, I know that really bugs some people so BE WARNED. This seems to have been videotaped from a projected reel-to-reel where the projector speed varied from time to time.",1424304000,,1726,4.553054662379421

8483661,4,B005QROFLC,"Man, horror movies aren't what they used to be. This is a classic that's not so much bad as it is dated, but that's what makes it so fun. Not sure how movies like this will translate to the generation under me, but boy they used to make fun horror flicks!",1389830400,3,255,4.019607843137255

8483664,5,B005QROFLC,"Ed Adlum, the prophet/god also responsible for the decrepit genius of 'Invasion of the Blood Farmers,' is back with the iconic, hesitantly titled 'Shriek of the Mutilated;' a tatty, tacky bigfoot shocker set in upstate New York.
Adlum is from the 'gritty verite/ no-money-at-all / devoid of any talent whatsoever' school of film-making - and I admire him for it. Not for him the fickle fan's rabid disappointment at his latest squandering of millions or envious accusations of sell-out; he has carte blanche to be dreadful and a bull-in-a-china-shop philosophy to all things celluloid. A rampant, thrusting, artistic charge, unburdened by subtlety or restraint. Or indeed, talent or creativity.

'Shot Mut' tells a simple tale of anthropology, cannibal cults and rousing adventuring, with no regard given to affectations like believability, cohesion or linear narrative. Adlum knows any one coming on any level to 'Shriek of the Mutilated' won't be expecting anything but the worst of exploitation and base culture.
What it actually says about it's culture is something else again.

After a five-second pre-credits sequence - taken from a completely different film - we learn of April: angsty, pained; and her husband Spencer: survivor, cuckoo. When Spencer hears of a proposed bout of yeti-spotting by his old oppo Dr Prell, he slashes his wife with a kitchen knife, then gets in the bath with a beer. Being not quite dead, but in terrible pain, she lashes the toaster in amongst the bloody foam - and bubbles him! Those two..tsk.

With no story exposition whatsoever, we're then off to 'Boot Island' and an 'isolated mountain lodge' for the yeti hunt proper. At last. There resides Dr. Werner - the local John Carpenter look-alike sasquatch expert; and 'Laughing Cloud' - his Al Pacino look-alike, de-tongued Indian butler. These two couldn't be more suspicious if they were dripping with the blood of baby Jesus and hissing curses and obscenities.
The 'isolated mountain lodge' is simply an ordinary house on an estate, shot at such an angle that you can't see the other houses.
Dr Prell and his four 'students' are soon plunged into a nightmare of odours, heartbeats and severed limbs as the lonely outpost is attacked by a bloke in horrific white fake fur. As if all that wasn't enough, there's a jaw-dropping twist to finish off the exhausted viewer in fearsome fashion.

The best/worst performance is by Alan Brock as Dr Prell, who makes Liev Schreiber look like Peter Ustinov.
Darcy Brown plays Lynn; one of those stereotypical plain women who takes off their spectacles and lets down their hair to become astonishing Amazons. Unfortunately for Lynn - post-unfettering - she's still a shocker.
Each and every one participating in 'Shotmu' is solid oak. Make-up by Ronseal.
It operates on a similar level to 'Carnival of Souls' in that you don't really know if the characters are sinister or just plain bad actors.
An experience nonetheless, at least you know that.
And therein lies it's berserk nobility.",1344902400,6,3012,5.066532258064516
