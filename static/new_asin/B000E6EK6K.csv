8106511,5,B000E6EK6K,"The best ever if you are a fan of Lupin Sansei.
A bit disappointed with the detective Zenigata who does have no resamblance but does not affect this masterpiece.
For the year done it is quite well filmed and acted for a japanese movie which are usually steady picture with no actions...
A must to see",1416009600,,300,4.375
8106512,3,B000E6EK6K,"i'm a big fan of miyazaki's works. monkey punch, not so much.

in this movie, you get an interesting mix of monkey punch's dark comedy and strange 70s sense of humor & film techniques. however, not anywhere near the best lupin material i've seen.

i think it's worth watching once for its historic value (especially if you recognize old japanese actors & actresses), but not something you have to own.",1387324800,,401,4.714285714285714
8106513,4,B000E6EK6K,"I'm not big on Lupin III. A combination of a plot hooks that don't really appeal to me and low-budget, old school character design has never made it worth the effort or money for me. But my friends like Lupin III and dragged me with them to see this at an anime convention.

I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I laughed a great deal, and not because of its hyper-retro 70s camp but because of its genuinely amusing, tongue-in-cheek silliness.

""Strange Psychokinetic Strategy"" is like a fabulous cross-over of Lupin III and the Pink Panther films: physical gags and slap-stick, a frustrated police chief, crazy assassins (in this case, sexy nuns), adventure, skillful, sexy ladies outwitting everyone else, and the most debonair Lupin ever.

This isn't really universally appealing -- those without a taste for silliness and a tolerance for campiness, intentional or otherwise, will probably roll their eyes at most of this movie. But if you have ever laughed at something involving Peter Sellers or Mel Brooks, you should give this movie a try.",1154995200,7,1057,4.828729281767956
8106514,4,B000E6EK6K,"This film from the 70's (based on Monkey Punch's ""Lupin the 3rd"") is actually an interesting film for Lupin fans. The story is like a prequel to the mangas and animes. The movie shows Lupin the 3rd's first encounters with Fujiko Mine, Daisuke Jigen, and Inspector Zenigata. Though the film relies heavily on slap stick comedy and 1970's music, which actually works well since Lupin's plot has a very ""70's"" feel to it, it's a very good comedy. Reccomended for Lupin fans, and anyone who enjoy asian comedies ""Like Kung Fu Hustle"".

Warning, this film is entirely in Japanese, with English subtitles. No English dialoge. Just letting you know",1144022400,13,641,4.8807339449541285
