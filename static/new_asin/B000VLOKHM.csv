8219382,4,B000VLOKHM,"Garderobe Academy is about to have exams. Arika is worried about the written exam, but the wilderness survival exam is also trouble. Arika and Erstin are partnered up for the wilderness survival exam. Erstin gets injured during the test and Arika has to take care of her. The Aswald cyborgs also get in the way of the training. Arika ends up being hurt and Major Sergay save her. There is also an episode where Nina loses the watch that her father gave her. Arika and Nina end up in a big chase to recover it.

Things are starting to get more intense. The characters and story are developing  better as the series continues. I hope that this series end sup being amazing, but it still doesn't hold a candle to the original.",1356307200,,723,4.46969696969697
8219383,5,B000VLOKHM,5 STARS  because it is funny with adventure/action. It was worth watching & buying as well as creative and well done. ARIKA  makes it funny with a few others. Now what i do not like is when they speak of wars and death.,1355961600,,219,4.069767441860465
8219384,4,B000VLOKHM,"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
In its way as good as the original My-Hime. Buying from sellers of good used dvds I bought this collection for a price a little less than a collection box set would normally cost. The shipping cost can be reduced if you go directly to the sellers web site when ordering more than one item. Make sure you can trust them.",1253577600,,510,4.322916666666667
8219385,4,B000VLOKHM,"Part way thru the story and things are changing. This here is a fine show and I've already bought it all instead of waiting for the inevitable box set because of it. Some of the female voice actors where lacking, but I'm guessing the American producers have a way too small bunch of women to fill in most of the roles. So some of the dub is awful, but it's in small batches.",1218326400,,374,4.136986301369863
8219386,5,B000VLOKHM,"Im a big fan of the mai-hime/otome Series.  This anime series is great, the animation quality is great and the story is nice as well, definitely a must buy for any anime fan out there.",1198886400,2,184,4.257142857142857
