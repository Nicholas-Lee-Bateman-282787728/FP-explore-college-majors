2350363,5,B000A1OFYQ,"This movie was GREAT!  Not because it was good, but because it was so bad you can't stop laughing.  I watched it with a buddy of mine and together we were able to identify at least 3 other films they stole footage from: ""TOP GUN"", ""IRON EAGLE"" (sweet!), and ""Navy SEALS"".  Can you identify any others?  I'm sure you can--just part of the fun of this movie.  My favorite part was when this Army lieutenant (wearing his rank wrong) boards an aircraft carrier so he can fly a bombing mission in a Navy F14 (because he ""knows the terrain"").  Didn't know Infantry lieutenants could do that--sign me up!  But seriously, why does he need to ""know the terrain"" at all?  HE'S DROPPING A LASAR GUIDED BOMB THAT FINDS THE TARGET ITSELF!  No wait, they use a missile instead of a bomb; you'd think the director would have seen even a little bit of CNN to know they don't do that.  Overall I left completely satisfied with this movie except for one thing:  it's titled ""The Marksman"" but I don't think they ever called Snipes by that name.  Instead they called him ""The Painter"" all the time.  In conclusion, this movie rocks!",1127865600,6,1113,4.477611940298507
2350364,1,B000A1OFYQ,"This movie is ABSOLUTE NONSENSE! Comes complete with bad acting, unbelievable plot, bad music, low budget effects, etc. There is nothing entertaining about this film...nothing!

2350365,1,B000A1OFYQ,Perhaps Mr. Snipes talent has diminished.  This is the second movie that is totally garbage.  The other movie (7 Seconds).  Save your money and time.  This movie is not worth it!!!!,1127347200,,181,4.741935483870968
2350366,1,B000A1OFYQ,I fell asleep twice when watching this. There is very little dialog but a lot of background music. Which makes it very boring. I was surprised to see Wesley Snipes in this kind of roll. Save your money go buy some pop tarts and milk.,1126828800,,233,4.2
2350367,2,B000A1OFYQ,"This movie is simply a cookie-cutter, straight-to-video, low budget, poorly acted stinker.  I like Snipes, especially in the Blade trilogy.  To see him in this film (though you don't see as much of him as you might think - he may have 20 lines of dialogue throughout) is really embarrassing after seeing his better work.  I guess all actors take some jobs for the money, and all I can say is that I hope he got a boatload for this one.  Emma Sams, the lead female actress, does such a poor American accent, that she almost seems as though her dialog was dubbed in.  The rest of the actors are directly out of the B-list and placed in sterotypical roles that are boring and predictable.  And the military scenes?  Ugh.  This film was written/directed/produced/advised by folks with just enough knowledge of the military and operations to be dangerous.  For example, the captain of the US aircraft carrier USS Eriske (or something like that) wears a hat that says ""SSN Eriske"" - for those in the know (and many who aren't), an SSN is a nuclear powered SUBMARINE.  Not a carrier.  Screw ups like that are prevalent throughout the movie - to include the almost total lack of hand signals during tactical movement on target by the ""Ranger"" team sent in with Snipes - everyone seems to prefer to operate by the ultra-covert ""talk in your normal tone of voice when the enemy is nearby"" tactic (haha).  And the individual Rangers seem to get to follow their own orders if they don't feel like following the orders of their senior officers (""I'm outta here!"" is one memorable line)  Oh well.  It may be worth a rental if you are a big Snipes fan, or if you have 90 minutes of your life you don't need or want back.

On the one positive note - the movie location scout did a great job - the ""set"" which actually appears to be in Russia or one of the Russian republics, is actually pretty cool, and may even be the saving grace of this film.",1126742400,9,1930,4.4586894586894585
2350368,1,B000A1OFYQ,"I'm not going to bother reviewing the movie, because I didn't watch it.  The blurb claims the movie is closed captioned, subtitled in English, and subtitled for the deaf and hard of hearing.  It is none of these, so I didn't bother wasting my time trying to read the actors' lips/",1447027200,,280,4.470588235294118
2350369,2,B000A1OFYQ,"I watched the whole thing so in my rating scheme that gets it a minimum of 2 stars. It does not really deserve that and the time I wasted watching it would have probably been put to better use watching paint dry.

This thing has a a lot of shooting and explosions and ridiculous martial arts in it, which if they had been done better might have made the movie a little better.

It has a plot that is absurd. Five rangers are sent on a mission to rescue some hostages and ""paint"" a decommissioned Russian nuclear reactor before a rogue Russian general can re-core it. Apparently the general is then going to blow it up as some sort of nefarious plot. But wait, the real plot is to con the US into blowing it up after it has been re-cored so we will be to blame for the devastation that follows. Wesley Snipes is the ""painter"". It is his job to put a small disk where he wants a missile to strike. Somehow this disk guides the missile in.

There is a scene where two army pilots (yes I said army) are sent to a US carrier to fly carrier based jets to make the strike. There is a goofy air combat scene that seems to have nothing to do with the movie after they enter Russian air space.

Some minor treachery at several levels.

Emma Samms plays some kind of intelligence analyst who is romantically linked to Snipe's character. I can't say much good about her performance. I think a mannequin could have done as good a job.

There is even a spelling error on screen on a computer monitor someone is looking at.

The team consists of 5 people. A captain is in charge of the team. At some point I recall someone referred to Snipes character as ""major"". It seems unlikely to me anyone would send a five man team on such a mission with both a captain and a major aboard.",1444003200,,1764,4.232142857142857

Now drearily familiar story of terrorist and/or madman's attempt to acquire a nuclear device for a 'fill in the blank' purpose.  Wesley is the only hope to avert disaster.  It's not that there isn't effort here it's just that the execution is so amateurish.  Generally poor action sequences/performances and an atrociously repetitive music score squash any chance of success.  Wesley can't need to work this bad......and it's a shame to see a cast member from Aliens is in the mix as well (William Hope).

2350376,3,B000A1OFYQ,"I think I had more fun watching out for and finding errors in this movie than I did enjoying this movie as entertainment.  Blatant error one: The ""Commanding Officer"" of the aircraft carrier USS Okla (if I remember right) was wearing a ballcap with the markings of SSN 798.  SSN 798 would have been a submarine.  Blatant error two: The hull number seen on the ship's island was 68 which would have been USS Nimitz.  Blatant error three: One of the F-14's number kept changing from 104 to 114.

As for the movie, Snipes has done much better work than this.  The acting, if that's what you want to call it, was pretty lame from just about every member of the cast.  Heck, even the ""Russki's/Chechens"" spoke very good English.

2350381,2,B000A1OFYQ,"I haven't seen nearly every Wesley Snipes movie ever made, so I can't speak for his entire filmography, but in my experience, this is definitely the worst starring vehicle of his that I've watched. Apparently, a lot of this one's lackluster quality can be blamed on problems in production that hindered writing and shooting the flick, but I don't think it had a lot of potential to begin with. Snipes has gone the direct-to-video, shot-in-eastern-Europe track before, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/other-times/dp/B000ELL1Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">other times</a>&nbsp;he had the luck of ending up with a halfway-decent flick. As luck would have it, this time it's just a slow, dreary military-based outing that could have been made with just about anybody in the lead role.

The story: an American special ops team including a mysterious ""Painter"" (Snipes) is sent into Russia to help disarm a nuclear missile launch site commandeered by a terrorist leader (Dan Badaru,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-to-Raise-Hell/dp/B004MLEYUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born to Raise Hell</a>), but their mission does not go as planned...

It's my opinion that action heroes like Wesley Snipes should never play parts for which they're part of a team like this, military or not: these roles tend to block their natural charisma by filling scenes with secondary characters who the movie thinks are important but who the audience couldn't care less about. This is definitely one of those cases, as absolutely no one on Snipes' team is worth remembering the name of, but the first half of the movie still tries to focus on them. It might have worked out, since early on the film teases an upcoming moral about the lone wolf tendencies of Snipes' character, but in the end, the biggest life lessons the movie can offer are ""just stand back and let Wesley work"" and ""don't trust the Russians."" Additionally, the script gives nobody a chance to truly act, including William Hope (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>) and soap opera sweetheart Emma Samms in their utterly thankless, action-free roles.

And speaking of action... The film's title seems to indicate this movie is about a sniper (heck, that's practically our hero's name). However, while Snipes does show off a bit of precision shooting, the reason the movie is called what it is is because ""marksman"" sounds better than ""painter,"" which is what the main character is labeled. From another angle, the title gives you the impression that there's going to be a fair amount of action in the movie, but this isn't the case. The entire first half of the film is practically devoid of not only story development but also of shooting, fighting, and explosions. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's too little delivered too late: there's a moderately decent chase scene followed by minor shootouts, a jet dogfight that nobody could care about, and a single unexciting hand-to-hand fight for Snipes. Totally overlookable.

Luckily, Wesley appears to have learned his lesson and to my knowledge has not returned to this level of mediocrity within the last seven years. The visual production values are relatively clean, but other than that, this one's interchangeable with the worst of Seagal's, Van Damme's, and Lundgren's low-budget fare.

2350385,1,B000A1OFYQ,"Like other reviewers, I pulled this one off the shelf because I enjoy watching Wesley Snipes.

Mistake.

Usually if a movie is bad, I'll shut it off immediately. This one was SO bad that I couldn't turn it off ... it was like watching a train wreck. The editing was horrible. I've seen better stuff on YouTube. Actors would be in one position, then a moment later, they'd be in a completely different position.

The story-line had HUGE gaps in it, and spent time introducing events that had little/no relevance to the overall plot. And then there was some allusion to some romance between Snipes' and Emma Sams' characters that made absolutely no sense.

Worst of all, if I was an Army Ranger, I would sue this production company. This movie made the Rangers look little better than Keystone cops. I actually laughed out loud at two lines which I'm quite sure were not intended to be funny. (""What's your name?"" and ""I'm outta here!"")

Absolutely ridiculous movie.

Skip it.",1202083200,,974,4.7

2350387,4,B000A1OFYQ,"During recent weekends, I had spent some leisure time to watch three action movies on cable television.

The three movies shared a common thread: the principal character was more or less a lone wolf operative, with military background; trained in covert operations & skilled in weaponry.

Although they did not have the plot intensity or complexity when compared with any of the recent 'Bourne' or even 'Bond' movies, they were generally entertaining.

For me, entertainment comes first when I watch a movie.

The first one was 'Target'.

The second was 'Avenger'.

The third was 'Marksman', starring my favourite action hero, Wesley Snipes.

I had watched many of Wesley Snipes' action movies: '7 Seconds', the 'Blade' trilogy, 'Art of War', 'US Marshalls', 'Drop Zone', 'Money Train', 'Demolition Man', 'The Detonator', 'Murder @1600', 'Rising Sun', 'Passenger 57' & 'Unstoppable'.

One of the reasons I like to watch him in action movies is because he is trained as a martial artist in real life.

In 'Marksman', he played an army ranger with the code name: Painter. His job was to mark out targets on the ground in preparation for directed missile strikes.

A group of Chechen rebels had taken over a supposedly decommissioned nuclear plant inside Russia. Together with a team of army rangers, his job was to go in & rescue the scientists. It was meant to be a simple extraction job. However, it turned out that there was a complex agenda behind the rescue & the mission was unexpectedly compromised.

The rescue helicopter was blown up. A few rangers were killed on board. The remaining rangers were captured on the ground by the Chechen rebels, with the exception of Painter & another ranger, who managed to escape.

Painter realised that the original mission would have sparked off an inadvertent thermonuclear war between Russia & the United States.

The remaining segment of the movie showed how Painter, using his instincts, outsmarted & outmanoeuvred the rebels to find out the truth & also to rescue their captured buddies.

The high-octane, explosive action sequences were beautifully choreographed, as Painter made a crafty manoeuvre to elude the well-armed rebels in one particular scene, & together with the other escaped ranger, mounted a daring rescue of their captured buddies near the nuclear plant, in another scene.

The final ending sequence was also good as well as gripping, as Painter rushed, under extreme time pressures, to remark the target for a directed missile strike.

There were some aspects of the story that intrigued me: it was hard to imagine that Russia would allow army rangers from the United States to operate inside their territory, not discounting the fact that US carrier-based aircrafts had also to navigate Russian air space to reach their targets.

Nevertheless, for me, I had really enjoyed watching this action movie. Just watching Wesley Snipes doing his martial antics already made my day!",1192579200,3,2941,5.106471816283925
2350388,4,B000A1OFYQ,"For all of us [the uninitiated] in the true life of our great military men, well we couldn't tell the diference in the errors.

Once we had gotten past the gaging booty bouncers the action was in keeping with entertainment.  Not quite what was expected of an expert marksman, but there has to be a certain mind set to pull it off.

It seems like there was some double dealing in Russian military - which Samms was asked to ferret out.

The Marksman, an elite U.S. Special Forces operative [grin] decided the the rescue was just a little too convenient and then, of course, the rescued shows their true colors and the helicopter blows.  Great indication that the Americans were set up.

Greatly loved the secondary target marker the Marksman set - all he had to do was stop the first marker - did enjoy his slide into the break in the floor.

Oh, yeah, and the team showing up at the last minute - just never figured out how they got picked up at the end.

2350389,1,B000A1OFYQ,"The Marksman misses on all points. This movie was so bad that I had to prop toothpicks under my eyes to keep myself awake. Snipes has apparently signed a multimovie contact with Castel Films--the same outfit that fatso Steven Seagal now works for (keep in mind too, that Seagal now denies he makes films with Castel, he knows they suck so bad). The story was ridiculous, the combat was silly (I love the fact that military stock footage was spliced into the film--if anyone looks closely you will see scenes that originally appeared in TOP GUN and US NAVY SEALS!!), the acting was so stupid it seemed that Wesley was falling asleep himself through scenes, and where--just where did they get Emma Sams for this? What pile of washed up actors did they scrape her up from? She delievers her lines like she was still learning acting in high school. Not that the script helped either!

  Snipes ho-hommed his way through this film and obviously did it for the cash, possibly to bail himself out of the multi-million dollars he owes the government in back taxes. He really would be better off giving up acting and taking the nightjob at the 711 near my house. I'd love to speak to him and find out--just how did he fall from grace!?? Shame on you Wes!

Both of these actors do an ok job with what they are given to work with. Like another reviewer said, let us be thankful they did not try for any flashbacks to tell back-story in this film.

The story line has the U.S.A. being tricked into targeting a fully functional nuclear reactor that was captured by Chechen rebels. And as we watch the missile being launched that will cause massive chaos for the region, if not the world, the Special Ops team led by Snipes figures out a way to stop the disaster from happening in an all to convenient and simple way. Still worth grabbing a bag of popcorn and checking it out from your local library.",1168214400,,768,4.485714285714286
2350391,2,B000A1OFYQ,"`Marksman' is not as bad as you might believe after reading so many negative reviews ... well, at least, what the film is struggling to be is not that bad. The problem is, you need much more money than is spent here, to make a decent action film based on this script, which encompasses a wide variety of action film elements that have been seen in such films as `Behind Enemy Lines.'

Wesley Snipes plays ""Painter,"" a laconic, sullen, and deadly special agent who is sent to a nuke plant in Russia with other elite soldiers. He must set a homing beacon for the missile attack AND save the life of the seven American scientists held as hostage there.

`Marksman' is surely a slick action film, but ""slick"" here merely means it does not spend too much time on Painter's past activities in Bosnia, or the relation with his ex-lover and senior officer played by Emma Samms. Fortunately the film has no lengthy flashbacks or anything that might delay the actions, and I personally find no problem with their acting or casting. The idea of US military officers speaking with British accent is not very effective even in the direct-to-video actions, but you can just stop paying attention to it.

The real problem is the film's unimpressive actions. They include several explosions, air battle, shoot-outs, and a tank running wild after a poor Russian, but none of them really works. I hate to say this, but the action sequences are mostly thrill-free, with terribly edited shots borrowed from action scenes of other better films. See for example the dogfight that tries to be as exciting as summer season blockbusters, but you know it only disappoints us when the film repeats the same footage, replaying the same cheesy explosion.

Many other reviewers have already pointed out the numerous plot holes and factual inaccuracies of the film. No film can be totally from goofs, I know, but the countless goofs in `Marksman' and its badly edited sequences suggest that the film company either experienced a troubled production, or they just did not know what to do with its results. Either way, it remains true that `Marksman' marks the career decline of Wesley Snipes who needs another `Blade' very quickly.",1160611200,3,2199,4.824933687002653

2350401,2,B000A1OFYQ,"I wrote the draft for this after seeing the film, and before I read any of these reviews, so everything is genuine and from the heart, no intended copying of phrases. I was so miffed by the awfulness of it that I felt I had to commit to ""paper"". I was looking forward to this after previewing the only wham-bam tankfire action in the film in a local AV store. How disappointing it is to buy the DVD and see the rest of the grunge that surrounds this thin sliver of central action. Stilted and wooden performances from po-faced and chisel-chinned actors and actress, who genuinely seem to be enjoying their roles - NOT! Not surprising really, as the script and screenplay seem like they were written in a school project exercise (into plagiarism). The same old cliches you've seen a thousand times before in hero/military machine/incoming missile made-for-video B-flicks are just whizzed round in a blender. Why on earth there's the (literally) running theme of ""Here's Wesley darting through shrubbery again"", I'll never know. Must have fallen asleep at some point. Will the DVD player ever forgive me? Must redeem myself and put on Black Hawk Down or even Behind Enemy Lines once more. Sorry player.",1131580800,,1200,4.8019323671497585
2350402,5,B000A1OFYQ,"I Admit that it was a low budget movie and action scenes were extremely primitive. But I couldn't find anything wrong about Snipes. It was a very good movie and the story was reasonable and intresting. Remember that, many foreign adorable movies make with low budgets. comparing the quality of a movie with it's budget is absolutely wrong. I Also admit that this movie did not suit Snipes, but that doesn't mean Snipes is a falling star.

I think people who rated this movie with one or two stars, have expected Rambo out of it and got dissapointed. this was a memorable movie and the storyline was rather new. so the real and honest grade of it was 3.5 stars ot of 5. but I gave it 5 stars to increase its rating.",1130198400,5,714,4.368421052631579
2350403,1,B000A1OFYQ,"Sad to see films like this mess get the backing of the studios when little films of far greater significance and value lie in languor.  This story (bad guys in a foreign country get close to atomic capabilities that would threaten the world until one turnaround soldier man saves the day and the globe) has been told so many times that the audience can sing along.  The use of a lot of night shooting is obviously well considered as there isn't much to see anyway.

What happened to the Wesley Snipes who used to make really interesting films?  Obviously the producers felt his star power could drive this dud as the remainder of the cast is unknown (though many seem to be really fine actors without the benefit of a script).

Thought about not wasting time reviewing this film, but then on the other hand, if enough people speak out about the bad movies that just keep coming down the pike, perhaps the studios and theaters will begin to pay attention.  Grady Harp, October 05",1130112000,3,978,4.56
2350404,3,B000A1OFYQ,"Hampered by a wooden performance from Wesley Snipes and an incoherent script, THE MARKSMAN is one of those straight to video action films that manages to keep the viewer's interest.  This is largely due to some good action sequences and stunts.  A pleasant surprise to see the lovely Emma Samms (Dynasty) in a rather useless role, but she adds a little class to the proceedings.  The story is predictable, and it's unfortunate that Snipes, usually a pretty animated actor, chose to play or underplay his heroic role.  Entertaining but non-monumental movie.",1129420800,3,556,5.076923076923077

2350406,1,B000A1OFYQ,"Synopsis:
With terrorists holding a recently decommissioned Russian nuclear reactor hostage and the possibility of it being reactivated as a bomb, it's up to the elite US Army Rangers to go in and stop the Terrorists and save their hostages before the worst can happen.  The Rangers are joined by the Marksman (Snipes) a consummate professional loner as they go in.  But not everything is as it seems. When things go awry, only the Marksman can save the day.

About the Movie:
If my synopsis sounds silly, it's because this entire movie is.  I'm a fan of Wesley Snipes, so I picked this up when it came out, sight unseen. Bad idea.

Unfortunately, this is by far the worst movie I've seen Wesley Snipes in.  He's been in some mediocre films, indeed, but this one takes the cake.  Filled with hammy actors and crippled by a ridiculous screenplay and ridiculously sloppy film editing, this movie screams ""B-movie.""

First off, The whole plot of this movie was just plain silly.  Russians allowing the US Military to do an anti-terrorist operation at one of their own nuclear facilities, simply because US citizens were on location?  Russia would never allow such a thing any more than the US would if the situation were reversed.  Worse is the suggestion that they'd allow a military airstike on their soil.  And what was up with the air combat? There was no reason for it but to see stock footage of airplanes flying about.

Secondly, the acting by many of the main characters was terrible.  Undoubtedly editing and direction had some blame in this as well, but the acting overall was just atrocious.  Snipe's female opposite (Emma Sams) was the worst offender of all, her lines delivered with all the conviction of a high school stage performer. It doesn't help that her dialog is just poorly written. Most of the movie's dialog is. And don't get me started on the attempted ""romance"" between her and Snipes.

Thirdly, I hate when movies get things so ridiculously wrong. Since when have any Special Forces run around with heavy, thudding footsteps, clearly visible flashlight beams waving around and talked in full voices while behind enemy lines?  REAL special forces use night-vision, barely audible throat mikes and hand signals, and they also learn how to walk without sounding like the Spanish Inquisition. This movie had those guys running around like they were a bunch of amateurs playing paintball. Worse, their behavior towards one another was just as ridiculous. The Rangers in this movie didn't even pretend to act like a tight knit military unit.

Honestly, just a little more attention to these details and the quality of this movie would have jumped up by 3 notches.

Fourthly, in a number of spots in this film, the camera direction and film editing was terrible. The most notable occurrence of this was near the end during a firefight.  The camera switched from an inside view to an outside view of a window, and in each case, the actor was in different positions and worse, moving completely differently.  It was distracting and glaringly bad. This happened in a number of other places. Editing film is an art, and in this case, someone was using a preschooler's fingerpaints.

Yeah, this movie was just bad.  It's the sort of movie you get a bunch of friends together to watch and make fun of the entire time.  The sad part is that this movie takes itself so seriously. Wesley Snipes must be desperate for a job to take on this garbage.  Frankly, his performance in this movie is so unmemorable, that you could have slotted in just about anyone and it would have come out the same.

About the DVD:
The Marksman comes in a standard plastic snap case. Overall picture and sound were decent and really I didn't notice any major issues with either.

Other features included a single aternate language track and a complete lack of subtitles, something I found a little odd.  Likewise, the special features on this disk are not special at all, consisting only of theatrical trailers.

Clearly there was minimum effort put into this DVD release.

Bottom Line:
The DVD is bare bones and the movie, well, don't bother unless you LIKE watching turkeys.  This movie is pretty bad.  Don't say I didn't warn you. A 1 star movie and DVD release.",1128297600,18,4250,4.771545827633379

Look at the glases Wesley wears in the movie, sometimes he does and sometimes he does not. Minor mistake and i don't believe it has a negative influence on the film. But there are a few more, have you found them? I give 4 stars. Wesley Snipes has done better films than this in my opinion thats why i don't give it 5.",1128211200,,439,3.888888888888889

8072458,3,B000A1OFYQ,"Chechen rebels with a Russian commander(?) take over a decommissioned nuclear power plant and have the fuel rods from North Korea necessary to put the plant online again.  Apparently, they plan to manufacture the materials necessary to create nuclear weapons, which would likely take a lot more time and expertise than this movie suggests.  It's up to the American military to rescue any hostages that might still be alive and make a pinpoint strike of the nuclear power plant to destroy it without spreading radiation to any nearby areas.

Clearly, this is a Russian problem, so the idea that we would be the ones to take out the Chechen rebels or that Russia would welcome the United States performing a military operation on Russian soil is very hard to swallow.  The movie does attempt to explain why we're the ones who have to save Russia, but it's still completely ridiculous if you know the slightest thing about Russia and Chechnya--unlike the writers of this largely idiotic film.

Wesley Snipes straight-to-video action flicks tend to be much better than those made by Steven Seagal or the WWE Studios and their stable of action stars.  That's appropriate since Wesley Snipes is overqualified to be an action star and was a serious actor once upon a time--although it was long enough ago that younger filmgoers probably don't even remember.  The Marksman is very slick and polished and has solid production values but the script is lousy and there's not much in the way of exciting action, making this one of Wesley Snipe's lesser efforts, even by straight to video standards.  It's a barely decent time waster but no better.",1496534400,,1635,4.898550724637682
