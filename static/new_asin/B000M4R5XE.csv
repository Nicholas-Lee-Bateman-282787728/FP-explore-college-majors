2724299,5,B000M4R5XE,This Helloween Dvd puts these original powermetallers on the map. We've been waiting for something like this for twenty years. Now world wake up and see for yourself one of the greatest metal bands in the whole wide world. I just wish they did more songs of their new album than all those older songs you have to hear again and again. But for all those not familiar with Helloween come and see for yourself why this is one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Dont' be silly...this will be your best dvd in your collection!,1174867200,3,527,4.387755102040816
2724300,5,B000M4R5XE,"This DVD is awesome I had no problems with sound, metal is full of crybabies that like to complain this DVD is well worth the money, I own alot of DVD`s and this is good ,so is the Kamelot DVD, and Maiden`s Death On The Road.",1173571200,,225,3.9130434782608696
2724301,1,B000M4R5XE,"You gotta be kidding me! I was waiting for this with great anticipation. Helloween is my favorite band next to Iron Maiden. I have seen them live twice, and they totally rock on stage. So I got this DVD and fired it up. I initially thought something was wrong, because this looks like crap! The picture is so pixelated you will find better looking videos on youtube. It's presented in a 4:3 letterbox format (WHY oh WHY couldn't they have made this anamorphic widescreen??), but there is something wrong with at least one of the cameras, because at the very right end side the video sometimes seem to be wrapped around from the other side. But not all the time... The worst though is the pixelation. My GOD, how could they release a DVD in the 21st century that looks like this??

The sound is decent though, so if you turn off the TV and just LISTEN to it, it's probably OK. But then again, I guess you could just stick to the CD. It just so happens I bought both.",1173139200,8,965,4.331491712707182
2724302,5,B000M4R5XE,"Helloween has allways been a great melodic metal band; 1 year ago they released the ""Keeper Legacy"" album, in my opinion one of their best (if not their very best). This Live album couldn't come out in a better time; For those who like this band, you don't have to think about getting it. The performance was great, the sound quality simply terrific and the track selection almost perfect (excpet for some songs that you really come to miss). I had the chance to see one of the shows of this tour, and when I put the DVD on my Home Theater, I almost thought that the guys were playing in front of me again. And don't miss the tracks of the past ""Keeper"" album performed by Andy Deris and with the sound quality of these days. A great experience for a metal fan. I seriously doubt that you can go wrong with this.",1172534400,3,812,4.279220779220779
2724303,1,B000M4R5XE,"This is again a typical HElloween II concert, playing their bad music and ruining the classic tunes which they didn't even write.  Miss the real HElloween?  Check out Gamma Ray, you'll be happy you did.",1172448000,3,202,4.742857142857143
8166267,5,B000M4R5XE,Yes it met expectations,1471219200,,23,5.0
8166268,3,B000M4R5XE,"I'm unsatisfied with the lack of animorphic widescreen.  For such a nice package and well-executed footage this is inexcusable.  The extra lines of resolution would have made some footage much nicer, especially zoom-ins of guitar solos and drums.

There are also a few camera angles that were not edited correctly, leaving a black bar on the right side of the screen.  The additional angles is a nice extra, but the inability to remove the pumpkin overlay (it's embedded into the video track) is a bit distracting.

Also distracting are some of the menus, with your typical stupid animations you're forced to sit through whenever you select something (at least they are brief).  The main menu goes on for a full minute before the selection screen, but luckily it's skippable.

The audio is superb.  The 5.1 mix is great, but beware that certain players seem to confuse the two tracks.  Selecting it in the menu in PowerDVD worked backwards, but VLC player worked fine.

The extras disc is a very nice touch.  Very long and packed with footage.

So overall, definitely worth owning, but I wouldn't pay a collector's price for it.

Also, CHECK WITH YOUR SELLER FIRST!  This was supposed to be the US version in NTSC.
I received the German PAL version, so I am unable to play it in my DVD/BluRay players or game systems.
Luckily, it loads fine in my computers.

This disc is now 10 years old.  Let's hope a proper remaster happens for a BluRay release.  I'd buy it in a heartbeat!",1454716800,,1477,4.684824902723736
8166269,5,B000M4R5XE,I don't know why people complain about sound or image quality... Mine has superb sound and picture!!  This is a great show. A lot of older and newer songs. They have a good stage presence and it really shows that they're having fun. A must!,1263254400,,240,4.333333333333333
8166270,4,B000M4R5XE,"The sound was fantastic and I really liked how you could switch between venues during certain parts of the songs. The show was great and there were actually very few songs that I missed. In fact, it was a great sampling to show to a friend who had never heard or seen Helloween before.

Why is wasn't perfect? The picture quality could have been better, but it was definitely not as bad as suggested by some other writers. I have a 50"" Plasma HD TV and bad quality would have looked horrible on this TV. It did not, but I would have loved HD capability, as several others bands (albeit with greater budgets, e.g., Iron Maiden) provide for their DVDs.",1208390400,,650,4.416666666666667
8166271,5,B000M4R5XE,"I see it in my country, this DVD is teh best, two disc of music is amazing, i love it.",1201564800,,86,3.35
8166272,5,B000M4R5XE,"I'm not sure why some people are saying visually is crappy and talking about Pixel(playing this on a computer DVD may not be good). On my regular 7 inch DVD player, it looks fantastic and the Sound Quality is out of sight. The DVD is one of the Best concert I have in my collection and I LOVE Helloween more after watching this. They play so many great songs, and it is so much fun to watch this. There are three different places they recorded this, and it goes back and forth between the three places and sometimes you have a choice to watch the same song being performed at another place. This Concert really makes you feel like you are there with the crowds roaring and singing along. This has Two DVD and the second one has a couple of Videos including my favorite 'Light the Universe' with the beautiful hottie girl singer. I bought the album after I heard that song. Lots of stuff here to enjoy and I watch it over and over again.",1200960000,,936,4.293785310734464
8166273,4,B000M4R5XE,"This is the first time I see Helloween performing live: From other world! Brilliant! Outrageous!

Andi great voice, Sascha & Michael what can I say? Excellent! Markus & Dani pacing the show. On the other hand, the audience totally involved, the classics included, what else do you want?

Drawbacks:
The subtitles don't work on the second CD for the interviews and stuff, on any language. By the way, I couldn't understand why these guys do not speak english with so many years in this business. :(",1186099200,,497,4.767441860465116
8166274,1,B000M4R5XE,You've got to be kidding me!???  The video recording looks like it came from one of those the Middle East guys praising allah.  It's extremely low quality film.  I'm very pissed off.  The audio sounds great.  How and why was this sold as a DVD?????,1181001600,2,248,4.4222222222222225
