386007,5,6301967364,"I got this VHS because I'd read about it on an obscure sic-fi blog. This is a terrific story, part of the classic Outer Limits show. Well before Terminator, a man with a glass hand finds himself in the middle of a galactic battle that could mean the end of the human race. The glass hand is his guide as he plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with the invaders.

I don't want to give away any more for those who have not seen this, or are not familiar with it. It's a terrific story that sic-fi lovers will enjoy.",1394928000,,514,4.089108910891089

386015,5,6301967364,"This is the only episode of The Outer Limits that I have seen. This episode was entertaining and interesting. Despite me being 18, I still like watching black and white episodes and movies. I don't know if this is one of the weaker episodes of The Outer Limits like another reviewer said, but I enjoyed this episode very much.",1307059200,,326,4.5423728813559325
386016,5,6301967364,"""Corpus Earthling"" is a classic example of how A Really Stupid Idea can made into a compelling story. Though the script tries to make a connection between viruses and ""living rocks"" (I believe the question of whether viruses are ""alive"" has never been settled), the idea is ludicrous. (But then, one of the best ""Star Trek"" episodes was about living rocks.)

What makes ""Corpus Earthling"" so good is the outstanding direction and photography. Gerd Oswald shows restraint in telling a story that could easily slip into silliness. And the dark, contrasty ""film noir"" lighting -- which doesn't come across well on a 23"" analog TV -- shows that the producers were willing to take a chance on making a TV show that was ""better"" than it needed to be. On modern displays, you can appreciate the the high quality. (You can also see the wires animating the rock creatures!) ""Corpus Earthling"" is one of a few ""Outer Limits"" episodes that should be transferred to Blu-ray from the composite negative.

The casting is a major element in this episode's success. The late Robert Culp was an engaging and convincing actor, and it's not a coincidence that he appears in three of the best ""Outer Limits"" episodes (the others being ""The Architects of Fear"" and ""Demon with a Glass Hand""). Salome Jens is warm and appealing as his wife, making the ending all that more tragic.

I've seen ""Corpus Earthling"" at least a half-dozen times (including the original broadcast), and have found no reason to change my high opinion.",1302307200,,1504,4.844357976653696

386122,5,6301967364,"I have to admit that this is one of my favorite episodes, so my opinion may be a little bias. This is another classic episode from 1963, in times when TV was still new and the special effects where lousy at best. But what made these episodes so great was the superb story, writing and performances by actors like Robert Culp. I have watched this episode only twice: once when I was a kid and a few years ago, after becoming ""senior citizen"", and both times I felt the same excitement and awe.",1293235200,,492,4.301075268817204
386123,5,6301967364,"This is one of the classic episodes of the series (1963) but maintains its freshness and relevance for today's audiences. Don't expect sophisticated special effects, but be ready to challenge your mind with very intriguing questions about the consequences of scientist's arrogance, the possibility of time travel and the paradoxes of it. The sacrifice made by the main character gives to this episode a touch of heroism that makes it difficult to forget. Martin Landau delivers, as usual, a superb performance in this double role.",1293235200,,530,5.247058823529412

386125,4,6301967364,"This is the 47th episode of THE OUTER LIMITS, shot in late October, 1964, and initially telecast during the opening week of 1965.  Its script is from Robert C. Dennis, with an original shooting title being ""The Brain of Donald Duncan"".  While not near the top of the series popularity register, it was well-received upon its release, during a period that had seen no clear winner of the ""space race"" contested between the United States and the Soviet Union.  A highly cerebral and adept astronaut, United States Colonel Alex Barham (Anthony Eisley) is restricted to a wheelchair, suffering from advance stage leukemia, and although resentful at his fate, he has been chosen on past merit to complete one final mission, an assignment that will require his living brain being transferred into a computer controlled robotic device.  Being already patently indifferent toward his long-suffering wife, Jennifer (Elizabeth Perry), Barham begins to welcome the concept of having a wall constructed between him and his fellow NASA project members.  The mentioned mission involves delivery of an American space probe to Mars, therewith establishing a flanking gambit against the Soviet space program, with Colonel Barham's brain having control of a computerized exploration function.  However, problems arise prior to the craniotomy, no surprise to the project psychiatrist, Major Douglas McKinnon (Grant Williams), who warns that ""subconscious drives may be released"".  McKinnon is of the opinion that an egocentric Barham may be the ""wrong choice"" for the radical experiment, while the project's military commander, General Daniel Pettit (Douglas Kennedy) responds to a disabled Barham's caustic challenge ""How will I do with pretty girls?"" with a sardonic ""How you doin' now?"", as the pair discuss the future Barham's capacity to see and hear, while at the same time being free from such human physical needs as eating and sleeping.  In fact, emotions do play a role in the affair, stimulating actions of the computerized creation, and a not unexpected malformation soon appears, as it becomes obvious that neural implants connected with the video and audio segments of the contraption are vintage sociopathic Barham, extending even to jealous feelings at his wife's blossoming relationship with McKinnon, evidence of narrative irony in the event that the purpose of the project has been developed in spite of clearly stated disapproval of Mrs. Barham.  Her husband had been somewhat of a philanderer, according to an opinion offered by his wife, who does not approve of divorce, and since his isolated brain becomes increasingly megalomanic, a hazard is looming that the ""new"" Barham might somehow apply an energy force in order to control actions of nearby humans.  As a largely studio-bound episode, the work must depend upon the proficiency of the players, and for the most part these are impressive, although a surfeit of subplots calls for more script coherence than is forthcoming.  Well-directed by Charles Haas, the picture's storyline is one of a good many that have been inspired by the popular 1953 science fiction film DONOVAN'S BRAIN, based upon Curt Siodmak's novel.  Although there is little need for FX use from the plot, special effects employed here are more than acceptable.  Imagery created by cinematographer Kenneth Peach is first-rate.  Veteran supporting actor Wesley Addy garners the performing laurels for his outstanding turn as the civilian head of the experimental space project.",1278288000,,3503,5.333938294010889

386127,4,6301967364,"Similarities to Day of the triffid aside, the inventiveness of a ""bad guy"" taking the form of a flowering bulb from outer space hooked me when I first saw this as a kid.

  Looking back at it nearly half a century after it was produced, one can take amusement at the sheer recklessness in absence of quarantine measures while taking these things on board a space station and then transporting them back to earth. But as a cautionary tale of invasive species and ecological mayhem, it was ahead of its time and may even have contributed to adoption of quarantine procedures in exploration and research.

  While others have commented on cheesy production values, The Outer Limits ALWAYS worked on a shoestring budget. This episode was above par, topped off with decent direction and a truly disturbing musical score.",1275264000,,815,4.869565217391305
386128,5,6301967364,"Once again, ""Outer Limits"" has excelled in its portal of human nature. Yes we know it is a Harlan Hellison script and adjusted slightly for Robert Culp, unlike the hatchet job done to his script in ""Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 28: The City On the Edge Of Forever (1966) see my review June 10, 2000""

Trent starts his day confused and does not remember much history. He discovers his hand is glass and conversant. Trent must go through the process, as we all must, of discovering the purpose of his hand and himself.

In the process, we may also learn a little about human nature.",1258329600,,713,4.5271317829457365
386129,3,6301967364,"I just caught Wold 359 earlier tonight and found it quite frankly disappointing. It was from the second season of TOL, and had it been made the first season my sense is that it would have been done differently and been much better. The subject matter, the discovery of a spooky spirit on a small, man made ""lab planet"" and how it affects a scientist, his wife and his colleagues, is fairly typical of the show overall all, and while the budget was lower than usual and the cast of characters quite small, these were the least of my problems.

Wolf 359 just wasn't very well written, the story not well developed. The script's author, Seeleg Lester, was a journeyman caliber TV veteran, while Joseph Stefano, gone from the show's staff by the second season, author of many of the first season's best episodes, was a master. Having just seen a few Stefano-penned shows I can see the difference. The writing of Wolf 359 is prosaic, the husband-wife relationship lacking in personal conflict, rather vanilla flavored. Yes, they argued, but over plot points. The ideas aren't bad but they're developed in a graceless, ordinary way. There's little flair in the show despite some outstanding talent behind the camera, such as Kenneth Peach and Laszlo Benedek.

I wouldn't quite rate Wolf as a dog. It's watchable, moody and interesting, and yet, having just been treated to some of the cream of the first season's crop, I can see why the show didn't last a full second season. There's something missing. One thing I truly missed: Dominic Frontiere's opening and closing music behind the credits. The composer who replaced him, Harry Lubin, who did a fine job for the earlier One Step Beyond series, was the wrong man for this one.",1247961600,,1723,4.759197324414716
386130,5,6301967364,"Though the Outer Limits series features episodes of inequal quality, The Bellero Shield is probably one of the best, along with The Galaxy Being, Demon with a Glass Hand and Keeper of the Purple Twilight.

The ambience itself is unusual for a sci-fi series, somewhat theatrical and of an almost shakespearian dignity (the plot could actually be perceived as a re-lecture of Macbeth.), with a strong fairytale feeling. As far as the cast goes, veterant actor Martin Landau masterfully leads the party as Dr. Richard Bellero, along with Sally Kellerman as his power-thirsty wife ; Chita Rivera herself is awesome as Mrs. Bellero's witch-like maid ; finally, the Bifrost Alien, briliantly played by John Hoyt, is probably the most benevolent and poignant alien in the whole series.

Like any other Outer Limits episode, The Bellero Shield offers an interesting reflexion on human condition, this time choosing to denounce our species' lust for power, through the tragic story of an Angel that came to Earth in search of friendship and knowledge, but only to face human defiance, jealousy and covetousness.",1209427200,,1102,5.150837988826815
386201,5,6301967364,"It arrived in the mail yesterday.  I couldn't wait to see it again.  This is my all-time favorite episode of The Outer Limits and it didn't disappoint me.  I still got the same chills as when I saw it back in the early 60s when I was just a child.  As a matter of fact, I welled up in tears at the conclusion.  I remember I had a crush on Sally Kellerman...she is gorgeous in this episode.  Chita Rivera fascinated me as the barefoot servant.  Neil Hamilton was great as the overbearing father and Martin Landau was perfectly cast as the son who desperately wanted his father's approval, support and love.  Yes, the effects are lacking compared to today's technology, but hey, they worked for me!  The alien, portrayed by John Hoyt, was outstanding.  I liked the way his voice would ""hum"" before he said a phrase.  And the way he would learn our language by ""reading"" our eyes...brilliant!

I'm very pleased with the service I got when ordering this VHS tape and extremely happy with my purchase!",1196380800,,996,4.533707865168539
386202,5,6301967364,"Some things should not be remade -- this episode of ""The Outer Limits"" is one those timeless pieces of drama that shouldn't be touched by another production team.
""Demon With a Glass Hand"" is one of those jewels you keep looking at over and over again throughout the years. Sure it has rough spots -- the shower caps and eyeliner is one of those. To me, that makes this episode all the more endearing.
The eerie Black & White cinema photography (it was shot in 1964 when TV still had access to older film crews who had come through the studio system learning their craft on great B&W motion pictures back in the 1930s and 1940s) stirs a noir sense about the piece. It's got sort of a ""Casablanca,"" ""Lady of the Lake ""and ""D.O.A."" feel to it. If it were to be remade today, this would most certainly be out the door (unless Ridley Scott wanted to do it, but he'd probably say he's already done this type of film before).
Set in the distant future, Robert Culp is Trent, and he has a mission of protecting humanity all of whom are stored on a copper wire. He's got to recover several ""fingers"" from his glass hand, which in reality is a computer/navigation/advisor for Trent.
Stuck in the remarkably timeless Bradbury Building in L.A. (seen Blade Runner?  Then you'll know it.) Trent moves through the action of the plot in a literal up-and-down linear fashion -- unable to leave the building due to a force field. He battles beings from another time that, predictably, want to snuff out humanity. Along the way, he teams up with a woman who owns a dress making shop, Consuelo Biros, who starts to develop feelings for Trent.
I don't want to give too much away, just watch this episode.
An aside: Robert Culp is a real performer. He's not only an actor but a writer and director and a craftsman. It shows in his work. His three episode work on ""The Outer Limits"" sort of identifies him with the show to my mind. He was in ""The Architects of Fear,""""Corpus Earthling"" and ""Demon With a Glass Hand."" All excellent, individual episodes, and probably the best, if not certainly three of the top five, from ""The Outer Limits"" vault.",1194739200,2,2124,4.5168831168831165
386203,2,6301967364,"In this episode, a prisoner (Henry Silva) is chosen by earthmen to be the first man teleported to the planet Chromo, using Chromoite technology.  In exchange, one of the Chromoites is sent to earth.  The plot holes and idiocies make the episode unwatchable, despite strong performances by Henry Silva and Diana Sands.

Why is a prisoner chosen to be the first man to visit the alien planet?  We are told it's ""too risky"" to send anyone but a volunteer.  But... Other men jump at the chance for risky missions, like space flight or test-piloting new jets.  The first man to set foot on Chromo would be not just a guinea pig, but an ambassador, an emissary, the representative of all that is good in human beings.  Sending a prisoner makes no sense.  Yes, yes, cultures exchange prisoners all the time, but usually it's to get their own people back, and not as a ""first contact"" scenario.

And why is the Chromoite allowed to wander about freely, wreaking havoc and murdering and seeding one of our lakes with alien spores?  Even if he's not accompanied by guards, one would suspect he would be accompanied by scientists or journalists or politicians who want to find out all about the alien and his planet.

386206,5,6301967364,"For a child born in the 50's, the 1960's original ""The Outer Limits"" was a breath of fresh air in a television sea of westerns, variety shows, and cop dramas.  There was nothing else on the tube that offered wondering minds a place where sci-fi and social commentary blended so well.  Every week some of the best writers and established, as well as rising, stars would come together and offer audiences thought-provoking fare, mixed with great black and white cinematography and then state-of-the art special effects.

One of the best of the show in the superb first season was ""The Man with the Power"".  Donald Pleasence is characteristically meek as the man that, through a scientific ""chip,"" of sorts, placed in his head, was able to consciously, as well as sub-conciously, summon a malevolent force that could, literally, eradicate anyone or anything on which he directed it.  Pleasence's character is saddled with a shrew of a wife, an overbearing boss, and the demands of the scientific community; thus, setting the stage for his ""alter ego"" to come forth and wreck havoc.

Of course, the effects are crude when compared to today's CGI but ""The Outer Limits"" was never about the effects.

It was a show that dared to challenge its viewers with glimpses of what could be and how we should react to it.

And ""The Man with the Power"" does exactly just that.",1139011200,2,1360,4.782051282051282
386207,5,6301967364,"It's difficult to view old scifi movies nowadays without comparing their production design to what's available now. If you aren't in at least the 50-something age range, you probably never had a chance to see The Outer Limits in its native context, and the makeup and props and models can seem fatally cheesy. But if you were lucky enough to grow up with The Outer Limits,there were episodes that pushed you into mental and emotional regions, both fascinating and horrifying,that you never visited before in your young life!

For me, ""The Invisibles"" was just such an episode. I wouldn't again feel that level of horror at the hands of a scifi tale until ""Alien"" came along 20+ years later. (In fact, I'll bet ""Invisibles"" set the stage for my reaction to ""Alien"")Maybe it's the idea of a parasite that you can't just pick off of you with tweezers that gets to me.

As others on this page have said, the performances are convincing, casting is excellent, and Stefano's prose sets the usual vague, dreamy backdrop. The unlucky ""possessed"" ones walking around like torture-survivors with attached-parasite hunchbacks under their shirts was mighty powerful TV, and the scene where agent Spain is being sworn into the cult, while an unsuccessful conscript, with his new hunchback, watches from the sidelines with darkened, baggy eyes and whispers the words ""I just wanted to see if they gave you uniforms . . ."" took me to the 'Outer Limits' of what I could process. Apparently, these things didn't turn you into a blank-stare, anesthetized zombie. You were still you, free to live the horror of each moment of this godawful thing attached to you, until your new master had something for you to do. Gut-wrenching. After watching this episode, I felt as if it had planted parasitic thoughts in my mind - scenes and feelings and considerations that I couldn't shut off or get over for days. It wasn't the sight of it, it was the thought of it.

And therein lies the greatness of The Outer Limits television series. I don't remember OL for its special effects. Whatever they lacked, my practiced sci-fi watching brain would provide. What I do remember is the great writing and the human drama.

""The Invisibles"" has both - and beware!",1134086400,2,2227,4.821989528795812
386208,4,6301967364,"Great old television science fiction.  However, I need to correct Mr. Bernabo on the source of this OUTER LIMITS screenplay.  Otto Binder wrote the story used in this DVD in an issue of AMAZING STORIES magazine in 1939.  It was entitled ""I, Robot"" a full eleven years before Isaac Azimov's collection was published.  The publisher ""appropriated"" the title above Azimov's objections.  While crediting Isaac Azimov's collection, the recent Will Smith film also used the title and elements of Binder's story without giving any reference or credit.

386209,4,6301967364,"I watched this show when it was originally aired.  It left a lasting impression on my very youthful mind, and it's been entertaining and interesting to see it again lately.

The plot isn't novel--there are other sci-fi stories of combat between selected humans and aliens as proxies for their respective worlds or as entertainment for superior aliens.  This Outer Limits episode, though, pits a psychologically messed up human couple against the alien foes.  The man and woman have problems enough of their own and the man, played by Nick Adams, initially declines to fight even though that could mean the end of earth.  A hero he ain't.

But the alien Senator who's calling the shots helps persuade him otherwise.  The Senator makes the whole episode work, in fact, with his dry humor, precise English (the sure sign of a bad guy), and uncanny knack for understanding, predicting, and disturbing the humans' mindsets both on earth and on the battle planet.

The human couple sort of come to an understanding of each other near the end, and the woman (played by Nancy Malone) overcomes a personal flaw to kill the final alien, a moment before her partner dies (or so she thinks).  Interestingly there is no love story here.  She's married to someone else but apparently separated, and the Senator intimates that she'll remember enough of the trial by combat to perhaps help her resolve her personal problems with him.  The character Adams plays (who was fleeing the cops before being ""electro-ported"") picks up right where he left off when he's returned to earth, smashing out a window near the woman's apartment to use the fire escape.  She sees him, he sees her before he flees, but there's no recognition in his eyes.  Does he remember anything?  We'll never know.

  The show definitely had low production values and committed an unforgivable blooper with the two dresses Malone wore being logically inconsistent with the scenes, but if you overlook those you'll find here one of the better sci-fi TV stories.  Outer Limits did good.",1125964800,,2037,4.906432748538012
386210,2,6301967364,"The thirteenth episode in the series, this is probably one of the most senseless episodes that I have seen of the Outer Limit series yet.

John Dexter (played by Ralph Meeker), is a rich tycoon who is sailing in the Caribbean with his team, searching for something which they do not tell us about (so much for the starting)! He soon finds a strange creature swimming underwater, and is determined to make it his prized possession. Eventually he gets the creature, which is a mammal, evolved from a whale and a dolphin. Now, Mercurio (played by Henry Silva), the dictator of the island, wants to get a hold of the creature to gain his reputation (even though we see that he keeps a statue of it in a room at his mansion, proving that he knows that the creature is supposed to be worshipped, but he disregards that fact anyway). But Dexter wants to take the creature back to the United States. So the two men start fighting over it, while the creature somehow breaks free and sends signals to its kind to come rescue him. The creatures do not take what happened to them lightly and make sure that the humans pay for what they did.

In between all the above lies a love story between Dexter and his assistant Lynn Arthur (played by Janet Blair). I was a little surprised that she actually chose him in the end instead of Tom Evans (played by Jerry Douglas), the marine biologist who is in the team with Dexter, since she was displaying affections for him for thirty minutes in the episode, while insulting Dexter. Anyway, that's not the main reason I was so disappointed in this episode. I just don't see what the whole concept of it was. Does this mean that we are supposed to worship our deities, otherwise fear an apocalypse (like how the creatures destroyed the dam)? Or is it simply supposed to tell us that being arrogant and treating people like objects (like how Dexter did) is wrong? If the second option were true, couldn't the writers of this episode have chosen a much more simpler storyline to tell this, without going through such extravagant twists in the storyline and over the head production costs? Even though the creatures and the locations were good, and the cast acted well (except for Ralph Meeker as Dexter, because he didn't show all his emotions were the same), this episode just doesn't cut it.

To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""The forces of nature will not submit to injustice. No man has the right, nor will the checks and balances of the Universe permit him to place his fellows under the harsh growth of repression. Nor may he again place the forces of nature under the triple growth of vanity, greed and ambition.

386251,3,6301967364,"A machine that opens into another world, this episode, which is the twelfth in the Outer Limit series, talks about man trying to make contact in another dimension.

Dwight Hartley (played by Barry Jones) is a rich man who is trying to contact his dead son. After wasting his money on mystics (who turn out to be frauds) such as Mrs. Palmer (played by Gladys Cooper), he is introduced to Ian Fraser (played by Mark Richman), a scientist who has invented a device that can pass through the borderland from our world into the fourth dimension (which could be anything, including the afterlife). Ian shows proof of his device by showing his left hand, which has turned into another right hand, the result of the accidental experiment. The device turns the positive matter into negative, reverses the magnetic fields, and turns everything backwards. However, because of the low energy, they are unable to conduct the experiment on other devices. Hartley grants Ian and his research team full energy power if Ian will contact Hartley's dead son while Ian is in the fourth dimension. But there are a lot of complications in between, including Mrs. Palmer and her assistant wanting revenge on Hartley and the research team's experiments.

This episode was very similar to previous episodes such as `The Galaxy Being', since they both talk about new inventions created by man to make contact with another world. This episode had so much potential to become one of the best in the series (like `The Galaxy Being'), I feel like the writers overdid this one. It just seemed like they were adding too much twists into this story, such as mystic getting back at the rich man, rich man hiring scientist to contact dead son, rich man's assistant wanting power and wealth for himself, scientists using power to open  borderland etc. The ending of this episode is also a let down as Eva magically rescues her husband while the experiment is still in progress, and he is in one piece! While you feel like the story is interesting, in the end you just feel like something was missing here.

To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""There are worlds beyond and worlds within which the explorer must explore. But there is one power which seems to transcend space and time, life and death. It is a deeply human power which holds and saves us together, when all the other forces are combined to tear us apart. We call it the `power of love'.""",1122422400,,2419,4.738717339667458
386252,5,6301967364,"Being the ninth episode in the series, ""Corpus Earthling"" is one of the strangest, creepiest episodes of The Outer Limits that will make you think twice about inanimate objects.

Geologist Dr. Jonas Temple (played by Barry Atwater) and his assistant Laurie Cameron (played by Salome Jens) are examining a pair of strange rocks that are unlike any other. Enter Dr. Paul Cameron (played by Robert Culp), Laurie's husband, who has a steel plate in his head. While no one is around, Paul hears two voices talking about taking over Earth by using human bodies as their hosts. Paul cannot place where the voices are coming from, and realizes that he is in grave danger when the rocks start controlling him. At first Dr. Temple and Laurie do not believe him. However, the rocks are determined to kill Paul for overhearing their plans, even if it means going after his wife and friend to establish a host to do it. Will Paul survive and be able to save his wife as well?

The main reason I loved this episode was because it provided a `rocky' ride with a unique storyline, interesting characters, along with love, suspense, horror, drama, and a shocking end, all rolled into one. Even the special effects of the rocks wobbling while they speak were really exceptional. Of course, the amazing acting of Robert Culp, Salome Jens and Barry Atwater (especially Culp) provided a solid base for this wonderful episode.

To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""Two black crystalline rocks, unclassifiable; objects on the border between the living and the non-living are the reminder of the thin line that separates the animate from the inanimate; something to ponder on; something to stay the hand when it reaches out innocently for the whitened pebble, the grey stone, the dead unmoving rocks of our planet.""",1122336000,,1796,4.862745098039215
386253,4,6301967364,"The eighth episode in the series, ""The Human Factor"" is basically an exchange of identities, one good and one bad, and how the bad takes advantage of it. This is not one of the best episodes, but it is better than a few.

In the frozen areas of Northern Greenland stands a Military Base, in which Dr. Hamilton (played by Gary Merrill), an army psychiatrist invents a device where he can connect his mind with another person and look into their thoughts. He tries his experiment with Maj. Roger Brothers (played by Harry Guardino), a delusional man who thinks they are being attached by a snow monster. However, due to an unexpected earthquake, something goes wrong with the experiment, and Dr. Hamilton finds himself in Brothers' body and Brothers in Hamilton's. Roger Brothers takes advantage of the opportunity, and pretending to be Hamilton, orders him to be confined, so that he can carry out his own mission to kill the `monster'. There is only one person who can save him: Dr. Hamilton's assistant, Ingrid Larkin (played by Sally Kellerman), who must set everything straight because of her personal feelings for Hamilton. But will she succeed?

This episode starts off slowly but picks itself up once the minds of the Dr. and the Maj. are switched. The main reason I was a little disappointed with this episode was because of the way it was directed. They creators wasted too much time in the beginning, and towards the end, everything seems to be happening really quickly. Otherwise, the concept of the story is very intriguing, and the cast, especially the three leads, Gary Merrill, Harry Guardino and Sally Kellerman did a wonderful job for their characters.

To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""A weapon, now only an instrument, neither good nor evil until men put it to use, and then like so many of man's inventions, it can be used either to save lives or destroy them; to make men sane or to drive them mad; to increase human understanding or to betrayal. But it will be men who make the choice. By itself, the instrument is nothing, until you add...The Human Factor!""",1122336000,,2088,4.762430939226519
386254,4,6301967364,"Imagine a machine through which people can monitor your every move twenty four hours a day, without you knowing? Being the seventh episode in the series, ""O.B.I.T"" is a thrilling psychological courtroom mystery drama that focuses on this issue.

The story starts off with Dr. Anderson (played by Lindsay Workman), a research professor (at a government research center called Cypress Hill), who is suddenly murdered after seeing a monster through a strange device. Enter Senator Orville (played by Peter Breck), who is trying to investigate the murder. What follows is an intense courtroom drama where Orville interviews various people such as: 1) Clyde Wyatt (played by Sammy Reese), an investigator from the CID who seems to know more than what he says; 2) Dr. Phil Fletcher (played by Konstantine Shayne), a research consultant in astrophysics who sent letters to Orville regarding the strange incidents in Cypress Hill, but was later prohibited from further doing so; 3) Dr. Byron Lomax (played by Jeff Corey) who tells Orville about O.B.I.T (short for ""Outer Band Individuated Teletracer"" ) and although informs him there is nothing to fear, Orville feels uneasy about the equipment; 4) Barbara Scott (played by Joana Gilbert), who spends sleepless nights because her husband has been taken away from her due to some incident regarding O.B.I.T.

This episode starts with a suspenseful murder, and ends with a shocking twist that will surprise everyone. With the advancement of the Information Age, you cannot help but think that such a device could exist, and after watching this episode, you get a very troubled feeling that if such a device was created, how the privacy of each and every individual would be invaded. Coming to the cast, Peter Breck acted great as Senator Orville, Harry Townes, Joana Gilbert and Jeff Corey.

To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""Agents of the Justice Department are rounding up the machines now. But these machines, these inventions of another planet have been cunningly conceived to play on our most mortal weakness.

386255,5,6301967364,"This is the sixth and one of the best episodes of the series, from start to finish.

Joe Reardon (Karl Held) is an astronaut who somehow passes through a time warp in space, and lands on Earth during the year 2148. He is confronted by another person (Martin Landau), who is genetically mutated for his time. He explains to Reardon that a man named Bertram Cabot Jr. created a microbe that destroyed the entire planet. Reardon decides that he and the creature should travel back in time so that they can prevent Bertram Cabot Jr. from creating the microbe. But, events take a drastic turn when Reardon dies on the way back, leaving the creature to find Bertram Jr. alone. The creature does have an advantage, in that he can hypnotize people to view him as a normal being. Will he be able to find Bertram Cabot Jr. and find him in time or is he in the wrong timeline? Can he stop the events from taking place without keeping his feelings for the woman he loves?

Martin Landau did an amazing job playing Andro, the man of tomorrow with a mission for today. The make-up given for Landau to look like a mutated being looks original and creepy. You can imagine where James Cameron must have gotten the idea to make ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (since it is somewhat the same storyline: man from the future comes to the present on a mission to destroy a person). But this episode really makes you think of the fact that each and every action that man makes creates a change in effect for the future.

To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""It is said that if you move a single pebble on the beach, you set up a different pattern and everything in the world is changed. It can also be said that love can change the future, if it clean enough, true enough and selfless enough. It can prevent a war, prohibit a plague, and keep the whole world whole.""",1121904000,,1845,4.404692082111437
386256,4,6301967364,"This is the fifth episode in the series, and although a little slow at first, it quickly speeds up and becomes interesting towards the end.

Edward Mulhare plays Prof. Mathers, a cloistered scientist who has invented a device to speed up the process of evolution. He has already tried it on an ape and the results have proved to be successful, since the ape shows advanced form of intelligence. Enter Cathy Evans (played by Jill Haworth), a simple girl who finds out about Mathers' invention and asks him to try it on her, so that she can become smarter. Unfortunately her blood type is not suitable for the experiment. However, she feels sorry for her friend Gwyllm Griffiths (played by David McCallum), since he is a low-paid uneducated coal mine worker, and asks the professor if he can try the experiments on him. Griffiths accepts the offer, and the Professor starts inducing him with advanced stages of evolution. Griffiths first shows some physical changes such as his head expanding, and wanting to acquire knowledge. But, the more he learns and evolves, the more irritated he becomes towards the current human species, which seem primitive to him. With his advanced powers and knowledge, will anyone be able to stop him?

David McCallum stands out in this episode as the eerie advanced form of man. I got shivers when he started smirking at the professor, or when he secretly entered the professor's room at dawn, looking more creepy and advanced. The make up done for him was really good. This episode speaks in many levels, as people who are trying to discover anything in a new field, have to prepare for the consequences.

To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""An experiment too soon, too swift, and yet, may we not still hope to discover a method by which within one generation, the whole human race could be rendered intelligent, beyond hatred, or revenge or the desire for power? Is that not the ultimate goal of evolution?""",1121904000,,1944,4.7970149253731345
386257,5,6301967364,"You are tired and bored of your life. Nobody appreciates you. How far would you go if you were suddenly given an extraordinary power that could destroy others? Scary, isn't it? That's what this episode is all about.

Harold Finley (Donald Pleasence) is frustrated with his life. He dislikes his job working as a college professor, his wife Vera (Priscilla Morrill) doesn't appreciate him, and he feels like he hasn't done anything productive his whole life. He feels like he wants to help scientists at the higher level in some way. Even though the scientists at the space agency do not accept him as a research scientist, they accept him as a lab rat to perform experiments on him. They install a link gate in his brain to give him extraordinary telekinetic powers. However, Finley doesn't realize that his power has a mind of its own, for when he is in a fowl mood, his powers destroy the object of his unhappiness without him knowing it. But since the scientists don't know about this, they think it is a breakthrough and decide to install these devices on their astronauts as well. Will Harold realize the side-effects of his powers in time to stop it from happening to others?

I loved this episode in many levels: The acting, the story, and the special effects. Credit for this episode goes entirely to Donald Pleasense on his acting. He did an amazing job in portraying a timid man who is given outstanding powers. The special effects for the dark cloud emerging and destroying everything added well to the episode.

To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""Deep behind the kindest gentlest soul, may lurk violent thoughts, deadly wishes. Someday men may learn how to cope with the monsters of the mind. Then, and only then, when the human mind is truly in control of itself, can we begin to utilize the great and hidden powers of the universe"".",1121904000,,1853,4.695384615384615
386258,5,6301967364,"This is the third and is one of the best episodes in the series, because while keeping the strange atmosphere of the series, it also managed to incorporate a love story into it.

A group of people in a secret organization decide that mankind is on the verge of another World War. They feel that a good way of uniting everyone would be to introduce a common enemy that all of mankind will fear. In this way, they feel that men will work together when they are scared and will get used to it even after they destroy the enemy. So the group members select a volunteer, Allen Leighton (played by Robert Culp), to transform him into the alien creature. Leighton agrees, putting his life and his family values aside. Even though he loves his wife Yvette (Geraldine Brooks), he does not speak to her about the matter. One day she hears about his `death', and is heartbroken with the news, but she still feels that he is alive. Meanwhile, the members of the organization perform tests on Allen to transform him into the creature, which is successful. However, their plans go amiss when the alien is transported to the wrong destination.

Even though this episode starts off in an eerie way, you can't help but feel sorry for Allen and Yvette in the end. It just goes to show you that you cannot make something better by doing something worse. Robert Culp and the gorgeous Geraldine Brooks acted flawlessly and stole the show in this episode.

To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""Scarecrows and magic and other fatal fears do not bring people closer together. There is no magic substitute for soft caring and hard work, for self respect and mutual love.""",1121904000,,1651,4.608843537414966
386259,5,6301967364,"This is the first episode and a great start to the series!

Cliff Robertson  plays Allan Maxwell, a radio station engineer for KXKVI who is using all the power of the station for his own purposes of discovering something important. Even though his family feels that he is wasting his time on something dangerous, Allan is convinced that he will be successful. His hard work is paid off when he is able to establish contact with an alien being. He communicates with the alien and they talk about human features, death, and God. However, Allan has to leave the station to attend a party on his honor, and tells the new DJ Eddie Phillips (played by Bert Metcalfe), not to turn the power up in any way. But, Eddie wants his voice to be heard everywhere, so he turns up the power. Due to this, the alien is transported into Earth, where it unintentionally starts creating chaos for the citizens of that town.

The main reason why I liked this episode so much is because it gives a simple message: Don't feel scared about something that is new to you; instead try to understand it. Instead of freaking out by the alien, he decides to communicate with it, and finds that it is harmless. If everyone followed this message (in general situations) even in today's world, we probably wouldn't be having so many problems! Anyway, the special effects for the alien were really good and effective, especially for that time. Cliff Robertson played well as Allan Maxwell.

This entire episode is very interesting, and in the end, it makes you wonder how you would have reacted in such a situation (if one ever came up).

This is a well written 1963 episode of ""The Outer Limits"" that has a core of truth to it; as a believer in the power of the mind, and the detrimental effect of negative thoughts, there are many things in this ""mind over matter"" scenario that reflect real life. Yes, the special effects are hokey, but the acting is good, with faces that are familiar to anyone who watched TV during that era; Edward Platt (1916-1974), who did hundreds of parts on both small and big screens will be instantly recognized, and of course the perennial Donald Pleasence, who delighted us for decades until his passing in 1995 with his oddball characters, and terrific performances.

An interesting aspect to the ""The Outer Limits"" series is that one would invariably see the beginnings of someone who would go on to great heights in the film world, and in this instance it is cinematographer Conrad Hall (1926-2003), who won Oscars for ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", and ""American Beauty"", though my personal favorites for the visual excellence of his work are ""In Cold Blood"" (Oscar nominated in '67), ""Hell in the Pacific"" ('68), ""Electra Glide in Blue"" ('73), and ""Road to Perdition"" (2000).

Other cast members include Frank Maxwell, Fred Bier, Anne Loos, Paul Lambert, James McCallion, Harry Ellerbe, and Paul Kent.

The premise of the episode is a misunderstood alien visitor, a theme which had already been done (1,000 times better) in ""The Galaxy Being.""  Eddie Albert stars as an intellectual prone to making huge leaps of logic because they are in the script.  June Havoc plays his histrionic wife.  They wander out to an isolated spot in the desert (all the better to save money by the producer) and are attacked by animate tumbleweeds and irate frogs.  June screams a lot, which is odd because they don't seem to be in any real danger at all.
They meet Arthur Hunnicut who appears to be a simple old hick (as he does in all his roles).  June finds his journal and discovers he is actually an educated man.  So why does he pretend to be a dumb hick?  Why doesn't he try to work with the obviously astute Albert to escape?  And if he is hiding his education, why does he leave the journal out to be found?  Hey, don't ask questions, look at the killer tumbleweeds.
This continues until Albert opens himself up as a vessel for the entity.  It posseses him and goes into a soliloquy about how Earthlings can't be communicated with.  Apparently aliens of this sort talk to themselves in overly dramatic fashion a lot.  Then it leaves, leaving the audience to feel, sniff, so ashamed because, sniff, we humans just don't understand.
Frankly, it is hard to find an OL episode that isn't better than ""Cry of Silence,"" for intellectual stimulation or even pure escapism.

A Megasoid, killer beast from beyond, has escaped from our hero's lab and is hiding in a museum display.  Too chicken to kill the beast himself, our now reluctant hero has an illegal duplicate made.  Complete with lapel-less suit and cap gun, our duplicate hero meets, shoots, but fails to kill the Megasoid.  Meanwhile, our real reluctant hero has trouble with the wife and is forced into a confrontation with the Megasoid and his estwhile duplicate.  After a lot of stalking, snoring, and finally shooting, he stumbles back into his living room with his now happy wife.  But is he the duplicate or the real thing?

Whew, and that description does not include two sub-plots that really lead nowhere.

Although I admire the ambition shown in the story, it's just way too cluttered to really work.  Too many ideas and too much talking de-rail what could've been a classic episode had the writers kept the focus on either the Megasoid or the duplicate.

On the positive side, the Megasoid is an interesting creation and I swear it was used briefly in the Star Trek pilot, ""The Cage"" (a scene not used in ""The Menagerie"").  The fact that this beast would hide in plain sight is facinating.  There is also a 'twist' ending which is kinda nice, though nothing to write home about.

However, the limited budget shows up in the gun the duplicate uses.  It's basically a revolver with two AA batteries taped to it.

Here goes;
A cargo plane gets caught in a typhoon and is forced to ditch.  The survivors then find themselves inside a huge alien probe.  Trying to find an exit, one of the crew is killed by a monster/large killer organism that roams around the ship.
Though automated, the creators of the Probe realize that humans are aboard and they manage to get them outside (and to safety) before the Probe destroys itself.
The basic problem here is that the inside of the Probe is obviously a large set, thus killing any interest in the story (what little of it there is).  Admittedly, there is a nice forced perspective shot of the survivors 'staring up' at a large beaker and weight measuring device.
Mark Richmond of ""The Borderland"" fame tries his level best to yell his way through this tale.  The rest of the crew remains anonymous, 'cept for Tigh Andrews (I'm guessing his name) of Mod Squad fame, who has only a short scene before dissapearing after the first commercial break.
There is also a really nice blooper.  The opening shot shows a DC-3 that's all silver with (what looks like) an Air Force symbol on the side.  However, when we see the close-ups during the storm, the DC-3 is suddenly blue with a white streak down the side (not to mention, it's obviously a model).

The story is set at a government research center called Cypress Hill and opens with a scene of a technician sitting in front of a circular display screen. The technician is viewing, apparently real-time, a research professor, Dr. Anderson, who is voicing complaints about his superior, which, the technician notes, is the ""12th occurrence"". The technician's attention is then shifted to the presence on-screen of what appears to be a ""monster"", and he then is strangled to death from behind.
 In the next scene, a Senator Orville appears at Cypress Hill to investigate the murder and the general morale situation at the center. Inquisitive and intolerant of evasiveness, Orville sets up a board of inquiry and calls several witnesses, the first one being Clyde Wyatt, an investigator from the CID. When questioned by Orville, he notes only that the technician was strangled to death but that he is ""not competent to say"" regarding any morale and psychological problems at Cypress. Wyatt's evasiveness angers Orville, and he quickly dismisses Wyatt from the stand.
 The next witness is a Dr. Philip Fletcher, an elderly man who has been employed for five years at Cypress as a research consultant in astrophysics. Fletcher had sent a letter to Orville, addressing the morale problems at Cypress. Apparently he had written several more letters but did not send them, having been questioned by the military police about the letters. Questioned by Orville as to how Cypress knew he was writing the letters, Fletcher responds by saying that ""they know everything"" and speaks of rumours and fear at Cypress. Cypress is a ""ghost town"" he says, and a place where ""no one laughs"".
 After being notified that the head of Cypress, Dr Clifford Scott, was unavailable for questioning due to suffering a physical breakdown, Orville calls a Dr. Lomax. Lomax states that morale is no better or worse than any other government facility, but Orville rebuts by stating the statistics: divorce up 400%, rampant alcoholism, and three suicides. Also, reports of a ""peeping Tom machine"" have been related to Orville, but Lomax refuses to discuss the machine. Orville then demands all information on the machine, and gets a demonstration of it the next day.
 Called OBIT for ""Outer Band Individuated Teletracer"", Lomax explains its operation to Orville, and illustrates its use by spying on a draftsman who is located somewhere in Washington D.C. Lomax states that ""those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear from OBIT"", but this is dismissed eloquently by Orville, who expresses worry and revulsion over the ability to use the machine to spy on himself when engaging in commentary on the President, his wife, or other senators.
 A fourth witness, Col. Grover, is then questioned by Orville, but Grover has no knowledge of OBIT's manufacturer or who authorized its deployment. Again Orville demands all information about OBIT and its history of deployment and when threatened by Grover as to his political future, dismisses any concern with it, stating that ""morality makes its own decisions"".
 Orville then calls Mrs. Clifford Scott, who states that the morale has been unbearable at Cypress and was left completely in the dark about the location of her husband.
 Grover is later recalled, and speaks of 18 OBIT units deployed in the military as well as many more in industry and education. He describes painfully OBIT as being the most ""hideous creation ever conceived"", and one that saps the spirit, and indulges in using it himself, not being able to resist its temptations.
 After insistence from Orville, Orville questions Dr. Scott, who describes his opposition to OBIT, and how he is always at odds with Lomax, who for some reason cannot be monitored by OBIT. The reason becomes rapidly apparent, as Lomax is transfigured to an alien being, who represents a race of beings who have deliberately placed OBIT machines on Earth to create rips and tensions in society and demoralize humanity, as preparation for their eventual invasion. He disappears suddenly from the scene.
 The episode ends with the announcer explaining that all of the OBIT machines have been found and destroyed and that whether OBIT can live up to its reputation ""depends on you"".
 The OBIT machine, with its ability to spy real time on citizens within a 500 mile radius, and even then through solid rock or steel, is certainly a technological marvel. Such a machine does not exist of course, but its abilities can be emulated. Governments can now engage in data mining and Email and business transaction monitoring, coupled with citizen spies whose sole function is to report ""suspicious"" behavior, can certainly have the same devastating effects as OBIT. The resulting suspicions and extreme paranoia accompanying these strategies of spying can indeed make life unbearable and demoralizing.
 We must make sure we have senators who think like Orville, and refuse to allow this kind of privacy-robbing technology to be employed unless in very extreme life-threatening circumstances. ""OBIT-like"" projects like TIAA and its children must not be allowed to progress and must be kept in check. Thankfully there are many in government who are taking steps to insure that these kinds of projects do not get implemented. Eternal vigilance among citizens, government officials, and the military must be unrelenting in insuring that these kinds of projects never be put in place. Such an attitude should be part of our consciousness and automatized in our belief structures and in our machines, for this is the proper morality in the information age: a morality which makes its own decisions.",1050192000,4,5779,5.091869060190074

The plot revolves around the absurd notion of a queen bee assuming human form.  How is this accomplished?  Could this be accomplished elsewhere by another hive?  Neither of these issues are addressed.  Instead the bee-lady makes a beeline (pun intended) for our scientist hero. She wants him to father her brood of world-conquering children (nyah-hah-hah) and thinks that his doting wife should buzz off (pun intended).
From there the absuridites pile up.  Our ""monster"" almost dies from food poisoning.  Later she whines, ""love me"" to our hero scientist, still hoping to seduce him into fathering her brood of world conquering insects (nyah-hah-hah).  Basically we learn that our monster-for-the-week is physcially weak and has all the manipulative cunning of a frustrated toddler.  Her defeat seems inevitable less than half way through the story!  Plus, her bee-buddies ""think"" the scientist's wife to death.  Now even if I could wrap my head around that, I have to ask why they need to propagate a hybrid bee-human race if they could just think us to death.  The good OL episodes would never allow such a gaping hole in logic, but this is not a good episode.
Much has been made of the attractiveness of the lead actress, and yes she is nice to look at and gets ample screen time.  Unfortunately, her acting talents are mediocre, and when combined with a mediocre script, the episode sinks almost as low as OL could go.

This has got to be one of the strangest, creepiest TV episodes I have ever seen.  Robert Culp is the lead actor.  He plays a government scientist that has been chosen by lot to be transformed surgically into an alien.  Why?  Well, the goodguys decide that a nuclear war is eminent and believe that if an alien would land from space at the UN, the world's nations would come together to fight a common cause and put their animosity against each other on the back burner, thus saying everyone from war.  The process of being turned into an alien and all types of operations procedures take up more then half of the episode.  The 1st half is the strongest part of the 52 minutes.  The plot actually kept your interest (even though it was moronic) and just the concept of going through an operation to become an alien is very bizarre/creepy.  Then...it all falls apart, or shall I say, ""it all unravels"" at the end.  Alien Culp (after being shot up into space) does not land at the UN, but at the same place he started!!!  Then his annoying wife (a Joan Crawford wannabe) gets a hot flash and runs back to the ""top secret"" base because she just has that premonition that her hubby is still alive and is there.

The Capcom was too unrealistic looking for the 50-60's period.  What was he looking at?  A mach-5 craft would have his neck twisted trying to track it visually, even at angels 93!  Op Center was woefully lacking any credible equipment to support an X-15 test at Edwards AFB - what's with the mag-tape drive?  Where was the Eniac? The Hollerith cards? The 4"" video tape recorders?

The X-15 crash would have been quite catastropic as the real X-15 crash was in the file footage (i.e. rocket fuel explosion).  He should have ""punched-out"" way before he lost so much altitude.  He had enough time (e.g. angels 93!).  How come a fire rescue team just happened to be so close to this randomly chosen crash zone?  How come the smoke from his X-15 was moving but everything else was frozen or slowly moving?  Again no fireproof pressure suit.  No onboard fire extinguisher.

How is it his wife is allowed in an active and dangerous desert test zone with a civilian 2WD vehicle?  How come the Air Force allows a nursery on base when the base is supposed to be classified, top secret, and quite dangerous?  How could they have hired such a stupid nursey nanny?  How could the time monster-man get trapped in time if he were not an X-15 pilot himself?  How come his so-called 'black' reality wasn't the exact same as theirs?  How can a Mach-5 aircraft cause a temporal rift in time?  Too slow I would think.

Robert Culp playes Trent, a man without memory being chased by the insidious Kyban. Outworlders who conquored the Earth 1,000 years in the future, but have gone back in time to capture Trent to find out just where the 70 Billion earthlings have dissapeared to. The secret lies within Trent's glass hand. A computer that knows all the answers IF Trent can capture the three ""memory lobes"" or fingers the Kyban possess. Almost all the action takes place inside the Dixon Building where Trent finds Consuela Byros, a poor clothsmaker who eventually falls in love with Trent.
This one packs real tension as Trent scurries through hallways and up staircases to find the Kyban Time Mirror. Robert Culp is superb in what may be his finest performance. His cat-like moves through the building, the budding romance between him and the hapless girl, and the incredable music are highlights. Complete with a bombshell of an ending that's brilliantly hinted at throughout the episode, but whose revalation is still a shock.
Of course, no review would be complete without little nitpicks. The Kyban are nothing more than humans with bad eyeshadow and shower caps. While Trent's glass hand is a marvelous creation, the way it raises and lowers on the screen is not well executed. And this episode continues the Outer Limits tradition of NOT GUARDING ANYBODY, NO MATTER WHAT. Allowing the hero or villan to escape. Still, these are very minor nits and certainly doesn't detract from what is the finest episode in the Outer Limits original series.

 However, like many dreams, this episode soon becomes extremely sentimental. I found the romantic moments quite annoying because the actors playing the young couple aren't particularly good. And the final conclusion, the missing piece of the equation found by the alien is something we have heard SO many times before...

Although the plot is well described in other reviews, a synopsis really could not do this episode justice.  Although the characters do a fair amount of talking their interactions give depth to their personalities and weight to their feelings.  This allows the viewer to be drawn in and genuinely feel for their plight.  Unlike most OL aliens the Luminoids are decidedly villians, their arrogance and cynicism being made very clear.  Yet even they evoke a measure of sympathy, as viewers can imagine the horror the Luminoids must live with, knowing that once they become adults they will become immobile, forever.  The conclusion is heartwrenching, but also inspiring.  I have found few stories, regardless of their medium, which evoked such a perfect balance.

The characters are a bit cliched, and the situations and dialogue simplistic, but the small cast handle the material well.

Alien anthropologist/zoologist Ron Randell illegally imports an exceptionally xenophobic and paranoid alien creature, the Megasoid, to Earth for study.  The highly intelligent and even more lethally aggressive creature escapes, going into hiding to complete its reproductive cycle.  Megasoids reproduce in the thousands, and decimate virtually all other species on the planets they inhabit, so it's safe to say Randell is not too happy about this turn of events.  He can't go to the authorities, and isn't about to get himself ripped to bits by the nesting murderous mommy cleaning up his own mess.
So, going on the philosophy that, if one crime didn't work out well, surely two will work out even worse, Randell performs another illegal act and calls in some favors.  He gets a clone made of himself, programmed to hunt down and kill the savage alien beastie.  Clones have been outlawed on Earth for some time, because they have a tendency to want to replace their originals once their predetermined job is accomplished (you've all seen Blade Runner).
So far, so bad.  But the fit really hits the shan when the hunted Megasoid informs Randell's clone that he's a clone, and then Randell has two problems for the price of one:  the wounded Megasoid is still on the loose, and now his other self is eager to get Randell out of the picture and move in with Mrs. Randell.
This episode falters from excess business.  Too many sci-fi elements are thrown at the viewer too fast, making the world of this story hard to identify with.  Additionally, Randell is a wooden performer, and the other principals in the story seem to be acting in a completely different melodrama style, which creates some unintentionally funny moments.  And Harry Lubin's futuristic electronic score, that worked so well for ""Demon With A Glass Hand,"" in this story only further alienates the audience from this already too alien Earth.
However, the Megasoid is pretty cool.  He's overused, making his monkey suit show too much at the seams, looking rather like an eagle-headed gorilla with enormous mole claws.

The story is an overkill combination of pulp sci-fi elements:  invaders from another world, time travel, and robots.  It's performed as '40s noir melodrama, and succeeds by audaciousness and deadpan delivery.  Amazingly, its reach does not exceed its grasp.
A thousand years in the future, Trent awakens in a world devoid of all humans but himself, surrounded by alien invaders called the Kyben who appear to be dying of some plague.  He escapes through a Kyben time-mirror into 1964, and the aliens pursue him as though their life depends on it  -  which it does.  One of Trent's hands is a computer, made of glass.  And the Kyben somehow know the hand contains the answer to where the seventy billion conquered future Earthmen mysteriously disappeared overnight, as well as the solution to the plague that is equally mysteriously killing them off.  A handful of Kyben imprison themselves in the Bradbury Building with Trent by means of a ""force bubble,"" where they play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse.
The Kyben are men with dark circles around their eyes and showercaps tight over their heads (some of whom also wear nylon masks), in simple black leotards and gloves.  Their weaponry, and Trent's, is nothing more than revolvers and everyday bullets  -  presumably, though it is never explained, to call less attention to themselves in 1964.  The effects are as simple and cheap as the costumes, yet the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts.  Harry Lubin's bizarre, atonal electronic score is highly effective at providing an otherworldly feel to the otherwise seemingly prosaic melodrama.  The performances are serious as a heart attack, and generally underplayed for greater effect.

The ultra-violent and badly confused Qarlo scares the hell out of everybody, and is quickly arrested and put in a padded cell for study.
Genial philologist Lloyd Nolan and put-upon baffled bureaucrat Tim O'Connor try to figure out what language Qarlo is speaking, and by so doing learn who he is, where he came from, and what to do with him.  Once Nolan realizes who Qarlo is and where he came from, he tries to socialize him into the twentieth century by making Qarlo a temporary member of Nolan's own family.  O'Connor and Nolan's wife are not exactly happy with the idea, considering Qarlo ""a powderkeg just waiting to go off,"" but Nolan's kids are up to the challenge.

George Macready gets to play the good guy for a change, the head of a nuclear power plant gone apocalyptic.

The radiation suit-monsters and wild visuals steal the show, the suits being especially unnerving:  Frankensteinian golems, with claw-hands and literal lightning-faces, that seize fallen humans and drag them to the cyclotron to ""convert"" them, itself a cleverly-done bit of business with the suits first deflating and then slowly ri-i-ising up to become more lightning-faced freaks.

By the time they find out what's going on, they're beyond help  -  but not beyond hope.
The only drawbacks to this episode are its sheer talkiness (mostly unavoidable, since a lot of exposition has to be dispensed with in a short period), diminished suspense by the revelation from the outset of the abduction (and its purpose), and the curious lack of any children in the stolen neighborhood.
Aside from that, it's richly atmospheric and often downright frightening.  The milieu throughout is eerie as hell, shadowy figures moving in and out of a pervasive fog, odd goings-on, strange sights and sounds...the feeling of actually being on another planet is exceedingly well-done.  The performances are uniformly excellent.  And the finale is the most moving of the entire series.
The new OL remade this one, which is not as good as the original.",1017273600,2,1299,5.09433962264151
386704,2,6301967364,"Amazingly, Quinn Martin's The Invaders didn't recycle this great plot, which trips all over its shoelaces on OL.
""Mr. Zeno"" is a special ed teacher with a difference  -  he isn't from our planet, and he hasn't come to help us.  He's a fifth column undercover agent, seeking gifted boys to clandestinely instruct in the use of his planet's superior technology, in order to create a standing vanguard army for when his people invade Earth.
This story should have been fabulous, but falters.  It's horribly padded, especially during the finale.  Zeno's origin is revealed too early, ruining the suspense.  Flip Mark, as the boy genius target of Zeno's designs, is flat and droning in his line deliveries.  The ending is laughably anticlimactic, and didn't have to be.
All in all, this one is a glorious failure, a really great story idea that just didn't get the care and attention it needed  -  and really, it needed so little.  It's screaming for a remake.
The episode is still worth watching for Richard Ney's splendid performance as the urbane killer from space, Mr. Zeno, whose false friendliness belies his cold and lethal persona.  The opening scene, in which Zeno murders a man who has found him out, is the most chilling thing in the episode.  MacDonald Carey is also quite good as the boy's father, who comes to realize Zeno's true identity and is willing to fight for his son even against a terrifyingly superior opponent.",1017273600,,1430,4.815573770491803

A sneeringly superior decadent Senator of the planet Andera abducts small-time hood/prizefighter Nick Adams and true-blue do-gooder Nancy Malone, to solicit them for gladiatorial games to entertain his jaded populace.  If they decline, the Earth is destroyed in a grand display lasting about five years  -  ""like a firecracker in a black summer sky,"" as the blase Senator shruggingly puts it.  If they accept, they are pitted in a duel to the death against two primitive but resourceful wolf-like apish aborigines from ""an unnamed planet in the Calco galaxy,"" on a prehistorically-climated planet designated the ""Arena.""
Given the nature of the script, this episode should be action-packed, but in fact is rather static (and talky) throughout.  It's memorable for Robert Johnson's gleefully sadistic Senator, who remains tauntingly in the shadows with his long, Mandarin nails and scepter of power, and for the smoulderingly suffocating atmospheric Arena.  The Calco primitives are primitive indeed, OL being pretty short on budget when this one was filmed, essentially nothing more than fixed-expression masks and clawed gloves (except for one or two close-ups, where the mask's eyes roll)  -  but no one ever forgets their weapon, which was probably the most famous prop of the entire series:  saw-toothed razor boomerangs.
Great beginning, with an imaginatively filmed gangster's poker game, long, rather muddled middle, and a decent last half, but the fairly dramatic finale is too abrupt.  The performances are good, especially Johnson's hammy melodrama villain of a Senator.",1017273600,3,1624,5.485943775100401

The alien's origins are never disclosed, but what he's about is obvious on the face of it:  he's constructed a human mousetrap in the outward guise of a house, with which to catch subjects for study.  Most of his subjects are petty and venal.  Until a drifter happens on in, and stirs things up a bit.
The less said about this episode the better, for those wanting to see it.  Suffice it to say it has great surrealistic sets, dark Gothic atmosphere, and good performances by the entire cast.
Overall, this is a great deal more like a Twilight Zone episode than an OL.  It has no opening or closing narration, and no real through story-line.  But it is fascinating, and pretty creepy.",1017187200,2,925,4.557575757575758
386757,3,6301967364,"Like a lot of OL's weaker episodes, this one starts out great and then muddles.  The script and the characters aren't too well developed, and a lot of potentially interesting story angles aren't sufficiently gone into once they've begun.
Warren Oates is fine in the title role of Reese Fowler, a man who has suffered an accident at a distant planetary outpost that makes his physical proximity to others a lethal threat and also enables him to read minds.  Fowler can't bear loneliness, but his fellow crewmembers can't take him back to Earth with them in the close confines of their ship, once they realize the planet they are working to make habitable for colonists is too hostile to support human life for any appreciable length of time.  Fowler snaps, holding them all prisoner with him until they can find some cure for his condition  -  but there isn't one.  And his colleagues can't escape him, because he knows their every thought and can kill with a touch.
Fowler is a great, tragically doomed character, and the tension of his colleagues is well-acted.  Their ultimate plan to escape him  -  equally tragically doomed to failure  -  is quite clever, and manages to create some viable suspense.  The finale is believable enough, but too sudden to be dramatically satisfying.  The mutant makeup is unquestionably ""eye-catching,"" so to speak, but frankly ludicrous, and too much exposure of it on camera undercuts the drama of the piece.

This is a cliched B-movie Korean War story awkwardly grafted onto a sci-fi story. Astronauts at our moon base (you know, that famous base we have on the moon?) discover a sphere that turns out to be a spaceship containing the hairy-eyeball inhabitants of another planet. Said hairy-eyeballs are benevolent refugee scientists from a tyrannical civilization that would exploit their great wisdom creating weapons of mass destruction. The astronauts vow to protect the hairy-eyeballs and maintain safe refuge for them, when said Tyrant-Eyeballs (in a much bigger ship) show up asking for them. In the end, the astronauts sadly relinquish the wise hairy-eyeballs to the Tyrant-Eyeballs, because they simply aren't militarily up to defending them...which is exactly what our protagonist did to a village in the Korean War, earning the ire of his mates. Now, they all know better...
The non-contemporaneousness of moonbases and the Korean War somehow undercuts the seriousness of the proceedings, as does the silliness of the wise hairy-eyeballs' wise pronouncements of all things wise about wisdom.
This episode does have one great thing going for it, however: really hairy-eyeball-pleasing effects, and good visuals. As for the rest...well, don't say you weren't warned.",1017187200,,1457,5.280172413793103

Highly padded (by virtue of the overlong teaser, which is repeated verbatim in the episode), suffering from really cheap effects, but a decent enough story competently enough presented.
It's the Andromeda Strain, with space barnacles in place of a killer virus.  The barnacles grow anywhere, reproduce like kudzu, and exhale a highly toxic gas in the process.  The astronauts who discover them don't realize until too late that they are bringing a deadly organism back with them, and the government has one helluva problem on its hands.
The performances are good, and so is the suspense.  The effects are pretty cheesy.  The production team was badly strapped when this one was shot, but they did a creditable job of making-do in spite of it.

The story is terrific, but it's never properly realized.  A number of people all born in obscure, rural Spider County in a given time period are all suddenly disappearing  -  and the Space Agency wants to know why, since not only are the vanished men among their best scientists, but UFOs are associated with the vanishing acts.  One of their agents attaches himself to the remaining young man fitting the profile of the missing, in order to smoke-out whoever  -  or whatever  -  is responsible.
Damn!  Sounds good, doesn't it?  Too bad it isn't.
The suspense is shot from the start, the dialogue is trite and often unintentionally comical, there's way too much padding and repeat use of stock footage (mostly of the BEM in a business suit stomping about the woods, who gets far too much air time for such a flimsy, if eye-grabbing, mask)...it just doesn't hold together, at all.

Superior in every department. The script is polished, the suspense is intense, the story fascinating, the characters fully realized, and the finale a haunting spine-chiller.
The radiant Sally Kellerman is cast against type in her best role ever, as the Lady Macbeth wife of Martin Landau, a genuinely good man whose genius is exploited by his venal and emotionally distant father, Neil Hamilton. Chita Rivera is Kellerman's vicious maid, who has already killed a man in her past. Rivera helps Kellerman murder and conceal the body of an accidental alien visitor (John Hoyt) into Kellerman and Landau's house, in order that Kellerman may steal its technologically advanced ""anti-weapon"" in her husband's name for the sake of power. Unfortunately, Kellerman failed to learn one thing about the anti-weapon, before stealing it from her victim - she doesn't know how to turn it off, and becomes an eternal prisoner inside it.
There's a great deal more to the story than that, but any more would ruin it. Astute viewers will recognize the ""anti-weapon"" spiel used twenty years later by Ronald Reagan to sell Star Wars to the electorate.
This episode is flawless. The cast couldn't be better.  The performances seethe and sparkle. The script is poetic without becoming cloying. The cinematography and the music are perfect.

The Invisibles are ""sick, nameless nuclei"" spawned in space and fallen to Earth, looking like mutant horseshoe crabs, that attach to human hosts' spinal columns and seize control of them.  The GIA (the CIA actually refused to let their name be used for the government agency in the story) have gotten wind of the Secret Society of the Invisibles, consisting of some very powerful political names, and infiltrate it with undercover agent Luis B. Spain.  The audience accompanies Spain on his adventure of discovery into alien invasion, and gets quite a few chills along the way.
The tension and suspense in this episode are superior.  It's a nail-biter.  The possession scenes are uncomfortable, suggestive of homosexual rape.  The cast is stellar, especially Neil Hamilton as a possessed general and the ever-arch George Macready as the head of the alien Society.

Joanna Frank stands out  -  literally and figuratively, thanks to a set of enhancing falsies she still likes to joke about in interviews  -  as a Queen Bee turned human bee-ing by her hive, in an attempt to breed with man and overrun the earth with superior hybrid offspring.  (Q: How did the bees manage that?  A: What are you, some kind of troublemaker?  They just did, okay?)
Philip Abbot is miscast as the object of Frank's sinister affections, but is exceptionally effective in the dramatic finale.  Marsha Hunt is cattily effective as Abbot's wife, who doesn't like this hussy homewrecking newcomer one little bit.  Frank is simply fabulous, a stunningly cheery, psychopathic femme fatale, who dispatches rivals to death one second and unfeelingly asks ""Can we get married, now?"" the next.
The camerawork and cinematography in this one are especially good.  There's a ""starburst"" lighting effect reflecting from Frank's eyes to give her a more alien appearance  -  and her eyes are already pretty large and almond-shaped  -  and the frequent skulking-about scenes are dark and shadowy, with added good use of music.
It also has two excellent scenes in it:  the finale, which is quite powerful for a number of reasons, not least of which is that you actually feel sorry for the Queen Bee even as you're glad to see the back of her, and the scene in which Hunt discovers Frank for what she is, which is chilling.  Much of this episode works because Frank's character never comes off as evil, rather more alien to our psychology, and extremely, extremely dangerous.  She is a strangely sympathetic monster.

Still, it's got atmosphere to spare, one of the creepier aliens of the series, and Miriam Hopkins as a demented spinster in a worse-than-haunted house.
Hopkins goes crazy after her bridegroom vanishes on their wedding night, back in the Roaring Twenties.  Now, many decades later, she lives in the mansion that would have been theirs, which has become a decadent shrine.  Unbeknownst to anyone else, she is secretly in league with an alien monster seeking to abduct more cooperative help than her snatched fiance in its quest to blow up the universe.  Along come a pair of underage eloping high schoolers...
This episode has a lot going for it.  Logically, it makes about as much sense as the Magic Bullet theory, but the imagery and the story are rich and unsettling.  There are two fabulously creepy abduction scenes, Hopkins' groom at the beginning of the episode and the high school sweetheart later.  The latter is especially unnerving, since she cannot be distinguished between experiencing cosmic terror or an orgasm in confronting the hypnotic alien abductor.  Hopkins is a pre-Patty Hearst study in the Stockholm Syndrome, a woman gone round the bend in lifelong coerced service to evil.
The script is weak, especially at the end, when the rather imaginative one-eyed monster-in-a-box talks too much and comes off sounding like a bass-voiced Marvin the Martian.  The finale is rushed, and if you pay attention you can see the high school youth jump his cue before the special effect he is supposed to be reacting to occurs, which is pretty funny.

It just doesn't hold together over the space of the hour - any more than its far-too-much-seen Jello Monster. The entire last act is so padded with repeat viewings of the same stock footage chase sequence, and unnecessary and illogical fights and killings - not to mention a pretty crummy musical score - that you'll kill the time waiting for something pertinent to happen by seeking the zipper on the monster suit.

Tourist Attraction has the sad distinction of being the reason many worthier OL entries looked so [bad] -  it ate most of the production budget for the first season.

Robert Culp turns in one of his typically magnificent performances (to my thinking, his best) as an average guy who desperately wants to believe he is just paranoid and hearing voices that aren't really there.  Because he only hears the voices in the geology lab.  And there are only rocks there.  Right?  Unless  -  oh, surely not (what are the chances?)  -  some of the rocks in the lab are not what they appear to be, and are really some kind of alien super-viruses.  And the alien super-viruses are aware of the fact that Culp is listening.  And he poses a threat to their invasion plan.  Which means...well, I guess they'll just have to kill him, won't they?
This one works precisely because of the preposterousness of the idea of ""talking rocks.""  Culp's performance is phenomenal, teetering between sanity and psychotic breakdown, as he gradually learns that, just because you're paranoid, that doesn't mean they're not out to get you.  Charming wife Salome Jens wants to believe him but can't (would you?), and finds out the hard way that Culp isn't crazy, after all.  So does geologist Barry Atwater, who is violently attacked by the aforementioned super-viruses which of course can't possibly exist.  A creepy Mexican shaman, who knows from the outset Culp is sane, adds to the shudders.
For horror fans, not to be missed.  Adapted by series producer Joe Stefano and Orin Borstein from an obscure paperback original of the same name by Louis Charbonneau.  (Which I have read, and which is not as good as this episode.)",1017100800,4,1658,4.970909090909091

Gary Merrill, Harry Guardino, and especially Sally Kellerman are worth the price of admission alone, but this entry has other attributes, as well.  It's thick with claustrophobic atmosphere, has a good share of wit (the military base, TABU  -  ""Total Abandonment of Better Understanding""  -  being just the beginning of it), and excellent suspense, with a genuinely clever ending.

David McCallum, who never turns in a poor performance, practically walks away with this one, though he is nicely matched by Edward Mulhare as the Professor Higgins (he played the role on Broadway, when Rex Harrison was on vacation) who transforms him into the Six Million Year Evolved Man.  Jill Haworth is touching as McCallum's ultimate savior, and Janos Prohaska even gets to do his famous man-in-a-monkey-suit routine to good effect.
What stands out in this episode are the various makeups/masks of McCallum's transformations, first to a man evolved ten thousand years into the future, then a million, then six million.  His first appearances, out of the shadows (the cinematography in this episode is incomparably good), are especially chilling.  The ending will leave you with the shivers.
This one is marked down a star for three reasons:  one, the episode has unnecessary scenes for padding (it actually doesn't suffer in syndicated cuts); two, the actors in the padded scenes have accents that ruin the illusion of being in Wales (especially against the three principals, who are English and Welsh); and three, the direction is often a little arch and melodramatic, telegraphing too much.

People around Pleasance begin to suffer  -  and soon, die  -  as a result of his discovery, solely because he had some petty squabble with them.  This is a story about real people, not ideal ones.  If the characters being hurt by Pleasance were all heroic, the story would rapidly become comic melodrama.  The fact that they are so everyday, and not exactly noble, is what makes ""the power"" so frightening.

The commercial showed two hunters out with their dog, getting the scare of their life when the reeds part first to reveal an alien hand with a ray-gun that destroys their station wagon, and then the hideous face of the thing that fired it, all accompanied by  OL's eeriest music.
Of course, by today's standards, the ""alien"" is pretty obviously Janos Prohaska in a papier mache monster suit on stilts.  It gets seen far too much in the episode to be believable.  But, as papier mache monsters on stilts go, it's actually not that bad.
What makes this episode work are the story and the characters.  Robert Culp, in the first of his three appearances in the series, draws short straw at the government think-tank on the day they're deciding who gets to play Evil E.T.  -  for real.  Unfortunate, for him.  He has a solid marriage, and a baby on the way.  (You'd think a bunch of guys trying to make a monster to scare the world into unity might've taken that into account, before deciding who would even draw the straws.)  Wife Geraldine Brooks has a strong psychic connection with Culp, and can't believe he's really dead after said government goons fake his death in order to keep Culp out of public view.  The best-laid plans of mice and men gang oft agley, however, and rather than make a hostile world a better place, the government goons instead only destroy one of the few beautiful things in it.

Outer Limits sometimes trotted out overused sci-fi stories, but very rarely did it not make them seem as fresh as if those stories originated from the series itself, and not from often less-memorable predecessors.

The Galaxy Being could best be called a ""hopeful tragedy,"" if such a thing can be said to exist.

My favorite part was actually the first future man of 20,000 years beyond owr selves.  He looks somewhat like us and somewhat like the telekinetic dome heads of 1 million years and beyond.

386877,5,6301967364,"An army security man is strangled under mysterious circumstances at Cypress Hills, a top secret military installation where a sinister new snooping system (the Outer Band Individuated Teletracer) is being tested.  This audio-video spying device can tune in to the individualized biorhythms of everyone on the base, except for the murderer, it seems.  The frightening implications of this new device for depriving personnel of even the slightest shred of privacy and dignity are unravelled in the course of a congressional investigation conducted by young, charismatic Senator Orville.  His persona is tough as nails, but smooth-edged with dashes of wisdom and self-deprecating wit, a la JFK.  This portrayal comes across as an intriguing reflection of the Camelot era, and we know from the moment we meet him that he is going to get to the bottom of things.  Likewise, we are shown from the opening scene that the murder was committed by a Thing Not of This World, a monstrous, gangly, one-eyed creature of obviously alien origin.  Our attention is also directed early on to one Byron Lomax, a sinister character who is in charge after the rightful director of the base is sent away to a mental institution, in Kremlinesque fashion we find out.  These plot threads are woven together in a tense, moody script with expert direction and stylish noir photography, giving this episode the unmistakable first-season OL signature.  The shattering and dehumanizing effect of invading privacy, feeding upon dark, all-too-human impulses, is the moral center of this story: we must rise above our lower impulses and temptations, or be dragged down by them.  In the latter case, we become easy prey for an invading alien race that easily sets us up, and can take over without a single shot ever having to be fired.  This is OL at its characteristic, intelligent best, with solid story and thought-provoking themes convincingly elaborated (e.g., we are our own worst enemies, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance, etc.); plus loving homages (intentional or otherwise) to schlock 1950's scifi cinema, most notably Wyott Ordung's hilariously inept ""Robot Monster"".  But it bridges the lowbrow appeal of such juvenile material with the prescience of George Orwell's writings.  The kind of sheer range on display here is breathtaking, and puts to shame what passes today as scifi cinema, with its monotonous emphasis on artless techno special effects and characters targeted to audience hang-ups and attitude.",996278400,3,2498,5.2175

On the plus side are the rich characterizations, the attention to atmosphere and detail, the juxtaposition of 20's period jazz with Frontiere's evocative score and of course the grotesque, over-the-top conception of the creature-of-the-week itself - which must have been Stefano's way of thumbing his nose at the ever-intrusive censorship board. The negative side: 1. there's the explanation of the creature's reason for existence which is such an incomprehensible clash of nuclear and meta-physics that it could make even a nuclear physicist's head explode 2. the episode comes to such an abrubpt and anti-climactic end - the creature out of the blue decides after 35 or so years that ""if I can't destroy the world, I must un-create myself"" - that it isn't clear if Stephano was playing it for laughs or again thumbing his nose at the network bureaucracy for imposing production deadlines or a combination of the two.",994896000,2,999,5.024096385542169
386917,5,6301967364,"Another seminal episode in the series, like the Zanti Misfits, but this time featuring a benevolent alien. The title device is brought by the alien who arrives in much the same way as the alien in The Galaxy Being ie by accident, little knowing that it has fallen into a house of family powerplay. Written by Joseph Stefano and directed by John Brahm who also directed ZZZZZ, the episode is described in The Official Companion as a ""combination of Shakespeare, ancient mythology, pulp science fiction, quasireligion, and legitimate theatre"". Stefano is quoted as wanting to write a `haircut' of Macbeth for Sally Kellerman, as the wife of Martin Landau's scientist and the Lady Macbeth analogy is made clear from a line about ""Your ambition is singularly the most active form of violence I've ever encountered"". Occasionally Stefano goes overboard eg Kellerman replies to her description with ""Lust is what becomes of an aspiration when it is allowed to grow and become ambition"". Brahm's experience in theatre is evident in the playing of the actors, with a choice part for a barefooted Chita Rivera witch with a vaguely lesbian air, and Brahm even manages to pull back that notorious ham Neil Hamilton. Tears aren't often seen in The Outer Limits so it's testiment to the sensitivity of Rivera and Landau when their tears fall, plus Kellerman gets a great scream in closeup. Brahm also provides a funny cut from the shield to the array of utensils used to break it. DOP Conrad Hall has fun in having the alien out of focus to allow for it's vasoline-on-the-lens inner light illumination when it is circled by others, and also posing the women in darkness.",994809600,6,1657,4.879432624113475

386920,5,6301967364,"This Outer Limits episode written by Anthony Lawrence and directed by Leonard Horn, is probably as seminal as The Zanti Misfits, but while this one too features a hideous monster, it also uses Conrad Hall's soft-focus lighting to create a romantic fable. As an inhabitant of the wasteland earth of the future, a vision which predates Planet of the Apes, Martin Landau has the opportunity to travel back in time and change destiny. Landau's English accent and Shakespearean intensity is right for his futureworld character, and when he meets Shirley Knight, together they deliver what are arguably the greatest and most delicate performances ever given in the series. Landau's appearance as one suffering from the side effects of a corrupted biological microbe, with The Elephant Man type cauliflower pistules on his skin, calls to mind the mythic parallels of Beauty and the Beast, The Frog Prince, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Horn provides a smoky forest location. At one point Horn superimposes a belltower with Landau crushing a flower that Knight had held. Knight's wardrobe recalls the heroines of the mentioned tales, and also Alice in Wonderland. Horn gets comic mileage out of Landau's ability to conceal his true appearance with hypnotic suggestion, with the screen dissolving so the onlooker sees Landau without disfigurement, although a continuity error spoils the shock effect of someone opening a door we see being locked. Horn also has Landau smashing a mirror, walking into the camera in his monster guise (pre Cape Fear) for lumbering emphasis, and uses an effective hand-held camera for a chase scene. Even if the spaceship is rather clunky, Knight's wedding veil is used for some kind of ... metaphor, and the last image isn't held long enough for it's full gothic resonance, Dominic Frontiere gives us a redemptive love theme for the doomed couple. The Official Companion tells us that Lawrence final scene was cut because it made the show run overtime. This is a pity since the scene as described offers an ending still downbeat but less cruel as the existing one.",992649600,4,2093,5.0520231213872835
386921,2,6301967364,"This is one of the sillier Outer Limits episodes, written and directed by Leslie Stevens, who had done the series pilot The Galaxy Being, but is not responsible for directing the best episodes of the series. Stevens' teleplay gets swamped in scf-fi blather, in trying to explain a cluster of intensely radioactive subatomic particles pulled fresh from a cyclotron that accidently come into contact with an isotope of Nobelium-238, in a nuclear power plant's furnace reactor, resulting in a magnesium glare that kills and introduces force-creatures which threaten to cause an atomic chain reaction. As the head of the plant, George MacReady gets the bulk of Steven' verbage, jabbering about ""quasistellar radio sources"", and his wife Signe Hasso is given ""If what you say is true, or even half of it...."". MacReady and Hasso make an odd couple, with him going all Charles Laughton, grimacing and spitting over his false teeth, and her syllable-lengthening accented English. The emergency allows for Stevens to re-use the electricity that featured in The Galaxy Being, another tale of alien life form that snapped and crackled, though the animated flashes of lightning are more Frankenstein circa 1931. (The similar effect used for The Man with the Power works better because it occurs in daylight and is accompanied by a cloud formation). The plant workers use hooked gloves to access the particles source, which scores a laugh when the hook is used as a reinforcing gesture by a speaker, and the sight of numerous hooked arms connected to the source brings to mind wino's warming their hands by a lit oil drum. This contact reaches a comic climax when the workers all stand hook in hook in a daisy chain, playing a dangerous version of ring-a-ring-a-rosy. One of the lead walls brought into to contain the outbreak is toppled, but it's hard to believe that those under it have been crushed when the wall appears to have the solidity of cardboard. The sight of Signe Hasso at a control panel, turning dials frantically also gets a laugh, as does the appearance of the Frances Farmer look-alike Allyson Ames as the requisite hysterical female, who runs her hand through her hair as she screams, and needs to be carried when she faints. Stevens however provides one great image of Macready and Hasso running in long shot into a bunker of light, and uses the infamous atom bomb explosion footage complete with windstorm and shattered buildings. This episode also uses composer Dominic Frontiere's ascending scale. The Official Companion amusingly parallels the character of MacReady as a lone scientist battling impossible odds with Stevens, fighting time to produce a low-budget show at the expense of story values. This may be read as a back-handed compliment to Stevens, since other directors on the show were faced with the same predicament, in particular Joseph Stefano whose It Crawled out of the Woodwork tackles the same struggling to tame the nuclear menace idea.",992649600,,2968,5.04684317718941
386922,5,6301967364,"""A Feasibility Study"" is a finely-wrought masterpiece, one of many from the cellars of classic OL.  This episode illustrates the sadder-but-wiser, paradoxically uplifting tragedy type of sci-fi drama that typified some of the best installments of the series.  On the one hand, the ending is downbeat.  Yet the focus is firmly upon the human capacity for virtue, to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, the ability to overcome against all odds--even a powerful, implacable alien intelligence that views earthly life with a cold and uncaring eye.  Also, in the grand OL tradition, this is an excellent scare show that delivers the goods.  The Luminoids are stuff of which nightmares are made, intensified by the pathology that ultimately paralyzes them and gives rise to their designs on our species.  Story credibility is heightened by the fact that the earthlings are not the only ones suffering.  The humans' altruistic solution to the alien menace saves our species from a fate we don't even dream of as we lay sleeping peacefully, and is all the more poignant because the sacrifice of the heroic few will never be sung.  And what overcomes the aliens' malign intentions also patches up the troubled marriage of the husband/wife protagonists, a stirring and characteristically OL element that beautifully showcases the economy, humanity, and essential brilliance of the scenario.  This is typical of the kind of mature, thoughtful, and highly entertaining storytelling routinely served up each week by the greatest science fiction show ever to emerge from the land of television (--Stephen King, if I recall correctly). PS.  Weighing in on a debate among reviewers below, can we get it right?  The alien ship resembles a bronzed badminton birdie !  ""Really, Ralph!""",991872000,3,1770,5.193661971830986
386923,5,6301967364,"""I, Robot"" is an engrossing, hard-hitting OL drama in the tradition of ""Inherit the Wind"", but featuring a robot wrongly framed for murdering its inventor, rather than a schoolteacher accused of teaching evolution.  The robot itself is effectively portrayed, a bit like C3PO from ""Star Wars"", but with a less ""non-threatening"" persona.  The opening scene shows him being hunted down by a posse of locals who have concluded his guilt before any facts have been determined.  The robot pauses to help a bratty little girl whom he has stumbled upon and accidentally frightened; but alas, she perceives only that he meant to harm her, and points the way he fled to the posse.  When he is finally rounded up and jailed, marked for the junkyard, the dead scientist's sweet-tempered daughter (Marianna Hill, of Star Trek's ""Dagger of the Mind"") tries to save him, with the help of a cynical, opportunistic reporter played by Leonard Nimoy (the H.L. Mencken-like role), and a crotchety but lovable lawyer (a Clarence Darrow type) whom he refers her to.  The lawyer has had a life-long, quixotic antagonism toward ""philistines"" and demands due process for the mechanical man; and the reporter has a sharp nose for a sensational story, so both have their own motives for taking the up the daughter's cause.  In a flashback sequence, we learn the robot is innocent and even child-like.  But the cards are stacked against him because of the narrow-mindedness of the human community that tries him and can't see past its own fear and craven prejudices.  The ending is cathartic, deeply moving, and unflinchingly true to the story.  It recalls a scene from an old ""Twilight Zone"" episode (""I Sing the Body Electric""), but puts it to shame for sheer dramatic impact.  This second-season OL episode packs a full punch, and illustrates how the vision and sensibilities of the show's creators continued to inform the better episodes of the second season even after their departure at the end of the first season.  This show seems to say that despite our human failings, there is enough to justify hope that we can rise above our flaws, based on the emotion and sympathy we come to feel for the persecuted robot--its a human affair and within our reach, a persistent theme of classic OL.  This is a tragic yet uplifting powerhouse episode that builds inexorably to an unflinchingly honest conclusion.  Fans of intelligent, humane, and thoughtful science fiction will not be disappointed.  This is stirring and unforgettable stuff with a solid moral perspective and a sharp bite.",991785600,10,2558,4.974178403755869

386949,4,6301967364,"Imagine William Shatner intoning: ""...to lead the way to new worlds, new life, new knowledge"".  You might think this is a slightly skewed recollection of his famous Star Trek preamble; but in fact its a bit of his dialog from this flawed, but still enjoyable, second-season Outer Limits offering.  Did Shatner compose his Star Trek ""pre-ramble"", by ""borrowing"" directly from this OL script?  You can't help but wonder, and he has commented since that he doesn't remember his work in this OL very clearly (in TNT's broadcast of interview footage with him during their OL marathon a few years back).  Hmmmm...  But diehard Shatner fans will exonerate him with no questions asked when they get a load at his trademark hammy acting, abundantly on display here (check out the photo on the video box!).  Similarly, a scene with Malachi Throne promminently foreshadows Capt. Kirk's full-contact collegial rapport with Star Base Commodore Mendez--you can see them getting their chops down as actors here, playing off each others' style and delivery.  Special effects are low-budget, but still exert an effective mood.  As usual for the original OL, it is the sheer staging of the scene that carries it off.  Playing Shatner's wife, poor Geraldine Brooks has to keep a straight face while delivering dialog in which she talks to the planets as though calling a pet dog home; its hard not to cringe a little, especially remembering what a good part they gave her to play in a first season episode.  But the story here is solid, of an astronaut who begins to undergo some disturbing changes after returning from a space voyage, while trying to hold it together in his marriage and his space exploration goals.  The dream sequence in which Shatner re-lives his frightening adventure on Venus is a high point, and pretty hair-raising.  As with so many Outer Limits episodes, instead of being told what's going on by some lab-coated doink standing in front of a blackboard and rationalizing it all for us  (as in a lot of inferior vintage scifi pieces), we are shown--a much more dramatically effective approach, and more stimulating to the imagination.  Although not one of the best, this OL episode is nonetheless quite memorable and better than much, if not most, scifi cinema.  But those who dislike Shatner (and you know who you are) need not apply; for that audience, may I suggest a rerun of ""Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation"" instead ?",990230400,,2428,4.902200488997555
386950,5,6301967364,"Between its title, its cyclopean blob-like monster, and its plot premise, this is one of the most pulp-inspired episodes of the original Outer Limits' fabulous first season. As often as not, Outer Limits' aliens were inhuman good guys, reflecting or embodying the higher virtues of humanity, a la ""Day the Earth Stood Still"". This is one of the few occasions on which the show indulged itself (and why not?) in the luxury of a little inspiration from the lower-concept scifi movies of the 1950's and '60's: alien bad guys entering our universe (from Outside, almost Lovecraftian!) to destroy it; and not so much from malice as from just being callous--impinged upon or inconvenienced by our space-and-time continuum. But grafted onto this time-honored hokum is a much more psychologically elaborate and human-centered storyline than is normally seen in such a plot, involving the desperation and frustration of its dramatis personae. The aging bride, whose 1929 marriage was only a few hours old (and ""still unused"") when her groom mysteriously disappeared, has been slowly and steadily driven to dementia by the strain. She still makes herself up (further and further over the decades since, one detects) as a flapper with cosmetics by the trowel-full, to a horrifying extent bordering on psychosis, offering an interesting counterpoint to the alien as an object of repulsion. As for her husband, he has been snatched away by the alien, into its little dimensional craft, within which space and time seem to be suspended--exactly the opposite of the frozen ""flapper world"" of his bride's delusions, in which time has marched on against her denial. And the alien won't release him until he agrees to assist with the plot to destroy the universe--which he won't agree to, because he is a ""heartless mountain of good"" (much to the resentment of his bride, aging outside the box). She is well aware of what's going on, and concerned only with her own unfulfillment. This episode has one of the most cryptic and labyrinthine story-telling styles of all OL episodes. Because of its subtlety, one has to watch closely and carefully, putting two and two together from a trail of little clues. No character explains it all at the end. Especially, one has to recognize by facial features alone, a picture in a newspaper seen but briefly. Its of a fellow who, at the beginning, we see delivering the dimensional craft, disguised as a wedding present, to the house of the newlyweds. Likewise with the headline of the newspaper story accompanying his picture, in which we learn by implication about the character motivations that set this whole ball rolling. But these elements function almost as a mere backdrop, with the nightmarish and incomprehensible events that unfold, centering around the arrival into this weird tapestry of a young couple who have troubles of their own. This is one of OL's many ""finest episodes"", and with my attention nailed to the TV screen, I felt an uncanny identification with the poor guy whom we see from inside the alien's box, with his eye uncontrollably glued to its lens-like window. Chilling, unforgettable, and unique--Outer Limits has done it again.",989971200,5,3178,5.055238095238095
386951,5,6301967364,"""Galaxy Being"" is the superb, seminal episode of the original Outer Limits, and it still packs quite a unique wallop today--indeed all the more so by contrast with the dismal state of contemporary scifi cinema. This is a towering, all-time great portrayal of the human encounter with the alien, who is at once intelligent, wise, noble, confused and stressed-out. His final, stern lecture to the foolish, frightened earthlings who in their ignorance would destroy him, puts this film into the same class as ""Day the Earth Stood Still"", one of OL's most important thematic forerunners. But then, in a brilliant stroke, there is a strong and daring infusion of emergent parallels between the rational and the non-rational, between recent discoveries of science and ancient, intuitive, mystical teachings--way ahead of its time in 1963. Another profound theme, embodied in both the alien and the Cliff Robertson character, is the courage of the individual who would seek to investigate the unknown, against the pressures of brain-washed society to conform, and all the efforts of authorities to keep humanity subservient and under control. Should these loner, visionary scientist types who break the rules in their quest for knowledge be careful what they're fooling around with? Of course; and yet, its often by mistakes that we learn the most and advance furthest as a species. The special effects are stylish and riveting, especially the design and imaging of the alien itself, which has few comparisons. The human/alien relationship is mirrored as well by the maritally troubled husband/wife couple, who have their own differences to overcome. The lame gender stereotypes of today's pathetic, post-Cameron/Hurd scifi offerings (i.e., the men as wimps or swaggering macho idiots and foils for the obligatorily smarter, stronger, wiser but good looking female lead) are nowhere to be seen, so you might not like this if you require that kind of shallow, formulaic content. The focus here, setting the tone for the whole series, is on the timeless and recurring themes of human existence, the quest for meaning, the finding of the self in the other, transcendence versus domination, the triumph of the human spirit and hope. Outer Limits is the Shakespeare of TV/cinematic scifi, and will admirably withstand the test of time. By the way, there is one unintentionally diverting moment here to watch for which I've got to mention, because I've never seen it commented upon elsewhere. It involves quite a double handful that Cliff Robertson gets hold of in the last act. How did that get by ABC's watchful eye?",989884800,8,2605,5.1753554502369665

First, before watching this fastforward the video (or laser disc, like I have) for 15 minutes. Why? Because the first 15 minutes are just general FLUFF used to stretch this out to an HOUR!
Second, the story. The scientists will make Mr. Duvall into an alien (EXACTLY like the ones that landed) and chase him into the alien ship in hopes the real aliens will embrace him? And Duvall is supposed to say to the aliens, I do not know my origin, but I've been on earth for a while? Plain ridiculous on every count.

A lot of the Outer Limits (in my opinion) come off more like 50's B movies than legit 60's Sci-Fi television, and this ep. is a prime example. I have come to the conclusion that most have good ideas but simply suffer from the TZ's 4 season of ""one hour programs for 30 minutes of good material.""

386956,5,6301967364,"Eddie Arnold plays an urbane, well-dressed city man with a hankering to get away from it all by moving out to the country. But his platinum blonde wife isn't too keen on the idea and has to be more or less dragged along under protest. When they get out there, he finds himself surrounded by Utter Weirdness.  No, we're not talking about ""Green Acres"", but rather its science fictional predecessor ""Cry of Silence"". This is a very enjoyable, zero special-effects classic of the original Outer Limits' budgetarily-challenged second season. I've often wondered whether the creators of ""Green Acres"" didn't get the idea for that sitcom from watching this show (the chronology would be about right)! This episode targets the viewer's imagination and fear of the unknown with great skill and enjoyable results. As in some earlier OL episodes which cast such mundane items as rocks and dust-bunnies in a paranoid light, so with this one; and after viewing it, one can never view tumbleweeds quite the same again. Frogs and rocks also become objects of fear (the former possibly foreshadowing the Ray Milland film ""Frogs""). The plot revolves around an incorporeal alien intelligence that occupies and animates ordinary things in a remote, desolate canyon, in a determined effort to discover and make contact with earthly life. This episode is strong on mood and story (like most classic OL), and one of the most hair-raising moments of all is when the alien possesses a human corpse. The alien force is so different from earthly life in form and substance that it doesn't recognize it as such, just as our earthly protagonists can't easily comprehend what is happening to them. The dramatic theme is the need of separate beings to overcome the differences that divide and separate them, to relate or make contact and thus transcend alienation, or exhaust themselves trying. ""This is the only flag we can plant"". A great nostalgia trip back to a time when science fiction had dignity and appealed not only to the mind (both intellect and imagination) but also to the heart, instead of just trying to play up to the immaturity and conceits of a spoiled, tasteless mass audience via empty special effects and vacuous psychodrama.",988329600,13,2218,4.97843665768194
386957,5,6301967364,"This episode is one of the best of the original Outer Limits' second season, after the budget axe fell and the show's creators left.  Scripted by Harlan Ellison, this is one of his works that was pilfered by the makers of ""Terminator"", leading to litigation (as I read in Cinefantastique, with coverage including letters from Ellison and the folks behind ""Terminator"").  This is a great show, and reflects a sharp contrast against today's standard of big-budget special effects and vacuously stupid ""stories"" peopled by obnoxious stereotypes designed not to offend anyone's socially conscious sensibilities.  Flaws in the storyline (why are the amulets within such easy reach, as one reviewer here notes) give ""Demon"" an edge like the brute illogic of a nightmare, and thus do not diminish its mood, which is powerful, lingering, and enhanced by a great musical score and murky, almost ""artsy"" black and white photography.  Likewise, it is refreshing in today's era to have a female character allowed to be frightened--dramatic credibility takes precedence here (YES!); there is no taint of ""political correctness"" to spoil it.  This show will only gain stature as a classic with time, but you might not like it if things like ""Independence Day"", postclassic Star Trek shows, or the Ripley Trilogy (Aliens 2, 3, and 4) are more your speed.",987811200,,1339,5.123853211009174

The makeup effects (by John Chambers, best known for ""Planet of the Apes"") are spectacular, both in technical execution and design artistry, while their presentation in lighting and photography does them total justice.  The story and characters are flawlessly conceived, and put the show on par dramatically with Shakespeare.  I especially enjoy the sisters, with their contrasting personalities, and the harassment of the one by a village lunk.  The performances are deadly accurate, the direction is taut, and the story builds like an unstoppable steamroller, leading to a gripping, delicately cathartic end. If you have only heard about the original Outer Limits, and wondered what the fuss was over, you could do worse than to check out this masterpiece of science fiction--it has few equals.

Apart from idiosyncrasies of personal taste, its hard to see how such a comparison could constitute a criticism, even if one agreed with it. Also, why would her being pregnant make her character's nurturing side ""funny""? This well-conceived subplot sets up some of the most dramatically gripping moments in the show, like Culp's discovery of her pregnancy when he sees where she's been shopping, and his desperate effort to phone her at the end of his ""schizophrenic episode""--a difficult scene expertly handled by Culp, not at all ""over-acted"". And please: the fact we're given no clear, whole-suit view of the alienized Culp is an absolute strength, a master stroke, not a weakness. The viewer's imagination runs riot at the brief, partial glimpses we get, a la Ridley Scott's ""Alien"". Usually, showing the whole get-up too clearly tends to diminish the effect of any monster (""Wolfman"" 1941 could have understood that better). Nothing can match the imagination, as Val Lewton realized. This show appeals to a mature imaginative audience, not to jaded boredom. Its like an iced tea spoon that goes way down deep to a core level, and then starts stirring...""Architects"" is the original Outer Limits at its bold, brilliant best, and its a lamentable pity we can't have movies like this made anymore.

Martin Landau is terrific as ""Andro,"" the mutant human from the future who can influence present day people with hypnotic suggestion.  Landau is such a class act; truly one of the best actors of these past forty years.  His voice transmits his earnest and gentle character's conflict and confusion in dealing with his own emotions (e.g., love, duty to humanity) and the awesome choices that his situation presents.

386982,3,6301967364,"The creepiest component of this episode is the casting of Miriam Hopkins as a Miss Havisham bride who has been abandoned on her wedding night because of alien interference. Director of photography Conrad Hall abandons his trademark soft-focus glamour to expose the aging Hopkins in a Grand Guignol manner, aided by her flapper wardrobe, with knee high stockings. At times Hopkins' campness recalls Bette Davis particulary since she wears a black wig and uses big eyes, and she is too pitiful to be considered a drag queen. The jazz score also recalls the Robert Aldrich/Davis film Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? The alien plot about an invasion somehow stopped by the imprisonment of a key figure in a doomsday box is pretty silly and writer Joseph Stefano deliberately undercuts it with a non-linear narrative. We are presented with consequences before explainations which oddly works for the story. This is probably wise since the fact that Hopkins' groom could be transported into the box by the alien when it first appears, but Hopkins not, is a fatal flaw in logic. In the Outer Limits Official Companion Stefano says that he was more interested in exploring a psychology of sex, with Hopkins and then a newly married couple with the wife under the age of consent and the cob-webbed bridal suite representations of virginity, and the disgustingly feculent alien monster both male and female sex organs. The Freudian metaphors are too obscure to work, perhaps undermined by the questionable virility of Hopkin's groom and the blandness of the new one, and by setting up 3 time frames, Stefano may have over-extended himself. There is a continuity error with Hopkins closing a door then returning to find it open, an obvious overdub in the opening scene, in a supporting role Nellie Burt is hammy portend, director Gerd Oswald doesn't make enough of Hopkins in her wedding gown, and the resolution is clumsily and dismissively staged. However the human transportation into the doomsday box has a primal terror since one is attacked in the eye, with an effective cut from one person attached to the box in semi-transportation to Hopkin's laying on her bed kicking her legs in time to music, and an arresting image with the overview angle of the inhabitants of the box.",987120000,6,2271,4.963254593175853
386983,3,6301967364,"This Outer Limits is unusual to feature a courtroom hearing as a series of talking heads, when otherwise episodes feature a lot of action. The scenario by Meyer Dolinsky centres around the titular surveillance machine, which Meyer used to parallel the House Un American Committe and Senator Joseph McCarthy witchhunts of the late 1940's and early 1950's. However the Senator who comes to the defence department site where a murder has been committed, ironically acts as arrogantly (and humourlessly) as McCarthy. The only seemingly intentional laugh in the whole episode is when a doctor is heard to make a derogatory remark about his superior - ""He doesn't know the difference between a periodic table and a timetable"". The obligatory series monster here is seen on the OBIT screen, which deliberately resembles the early round TV sets, and it is the sighting which accounts for the witnesses death. The monster itself is quite bizarre. The initial long shot view has it wearing a diaphonous gown, and it's mask face is half Halloween pumpkin and half unformed baby head. When the monster attacks another witness, it is unintentionally funny. Since the hearing's talking head structure relies upon testimony it becomes a series of performances, the best being Konstantin Shayne and Sam Reese, and the worst Alan Baxter. As the administrator of the base and the one associated with the OBIT, Jeff Corey wears distortive bottle-bottom black-rimmed spectacles which give him a great look but his climactic grandiose speech is undercut by it coming out of nowhere, and the maniac way it is filmed by director Gerd Oswald. The narrative also features a few plot holes - an affair has no pay off, and the monster has the unexplained ability to be in two places at once. However Oswald provides some redemptive images - a flashing cheap hotel sign, the ominous placement of Corey's overly hairy hand, and the soft-focus lighting of Joanne Gilbert as the base commander's wife, who still manages to come off as an anorexic transexual.",987033600,,2027,5.035714285714286
386984,2,6301967364,"As the last of the 3 episodes featuring Robert Culp - the others being The Architects of Fear and Corpus Earthling - and based on a teleplay written specifically for him, this is his weakest performance. Culp benefited enormously from his costarring with Salome Jens in Corpus Earthling, and the director of that episode, Gerd Oswald managed to overcome Culp's narcissistic self-involvement. However as the director of this episode and The Architects of Fear, which had Culp ill-matched with Geraldine Brooks, Byron Haskin is not so successful, even given the nature of Culp's character. In fact the more memorable performance comes from Arline Martel as Consuelo. In other circumstances she would be critised for incompetence, but in a perverse way, this both works for her character and given Culp, who looks very odd prancing around the set, striking balletic poses. Consuelo's appearance in the treatment is but one of the inconsistencies. We are told Culp is the last man on earth, so Consuelo's presence is unexplained, something also not questioned by the Kyben's, aliens who have invaded and who are pursuing Culp for his glass hand. Consuelo seems to exist to be educated, a weak excuse for repetition of exposition. Since the narrative talks of but doesn't present multiple time frames, this only comes across as bad writing. The exteriors show cars driving and since the Kyben's travel via a mirror, we also wonder who is in the cars? The glass hand is another victim of continuity - it's form changing to suit whatever Culp is doing, and the fingers of the glove that cover it often filled out where the hand is fingerless. Since the Kyben's are advanced enough to be able to master time travel you would think they would have better weaponry than handguns. Their apparel of rubber, leather and tights, with charcoaled eye makeup has amusing suggestions of fetishism, and a scene where a beautiful young Kyben man is chained in submission screams bondage and sado-masochism. Even the condom-like hats are suspect, and one could even project something onto the way Culp pulls off a necklace they wear, to eliminate them. The episode is essentially a chase, with Culp and Martel trapped in the baroque Dixon Building which the Kybens have inhabited. Our appreciation of the beauty of the architecture of this building is fleeting since Haskin doesn't allow for this, and when the couple discover an attic with manniquins, we realise we have the wrong director for the possibilities of hiding-in-a-department-store thriller. However Haskin does pre-empt Scorsese's Cape Fear Robert de Niro walking into the camera shot, adding a later repeat with a cut to Culp walking away, as if he has walked through the camera, and I liked the way he has Martel cling to a wall when Culp is shot.",986860800,,2792,4.980728051391863
386985,2,6301967364,"Unfortunately I cannot join the chorus of admiration for this episode since the premise and execution is so one-dimensional. Perhaps the tragic element to the fate of Robert Culp's character, a scientist picked out of a hat to undergo a surgical transformation into an alien for the world to unite in defense against, might have had more resonance for me if the performance of his wife by Geraldine Brooks wasn't so Joan Crawford-ish. As it is their scenes together, particularly one where she cradles his head, have an odd mother-son tone, which is funny since the idea of her being pregant is repeatedly raised. Calling the shop they visit From Here to Maternity is a nice touch. What isn't considered is that if Culp had impregnated Brooks after begininng the transformation procedures, wouldn't that have an effect on her unborn child? Based on how Culp turns out as the alien, at least we know the kid will be damn tall. It's a pity actually that we're never given a clear view of Culp's alien get-up, since it looks quite remarkeable, and an improvement after the ludicruous amphibian of Tourist Attraction. This episode has a major plot hole, which is probably more obvious since the material is so shallow - why do the scientists need to duplicate the alien when they already have one captured which everyone seems to be terrified of, though it looks as threatening as a stuffed toy monkey? I suppose we're to think these architects are limited both by their fear, and their lack of expertise since their alien is downed so easily. Except for his awful over-acting in the ""schizophrenic episode"" scene, where he performs a dazzling jump into a wall shelf and seems to discover the method ramble simultaneously, Culp underplays and even gets a laugh when asked how he feels after surgery, and he responds depressed. There are some camp touches as well - Brooks hit with a symbiotic feeling of pain, when she is walking in the street, the stock footage of crowds running in the street in the opening movie, the way the trio of backwood hunters are framed together a la Ingmar Bergman, and the intense performance of Leonard Stone. Re the symbiotic thing, I liked a cut from panic in surgery when breathing stops, to Brooks head-tossed-back crying as she clears out Culp's office.",981763200,2,2285,4.802030456852792

The new series, by contrast, achieves exactly the opposite by making newer themes seem old and stale through cliched presentations.  Same name, very different series.
Martin Landau is superb as Andro, the sensitive and peace-loving human mutant from the future who hates the task he must carry out.  Everyone is top-notch, in fact.  The themes within themes make each viewing a new experience.

The episode clip involves a large-domed McCallum in his final phase of induced evolution staring down two motorcycle cops and saying, ""Your ignorance makes me ill and angry!""

387030,2,6301967364,"This is one of the few episodes written and directed by series executive producer Leslie Stevens. Like his Production and Decay of Strange Particles, this also centres on a lone scientist on a quest, this time to cross-over into the fourth dimension otherwise known as the Borderland. However Stevens gets so bogged down in the clunky mechanics of the experiment that when we get to the possibility of the cross-over it is a huge disappointment. Theatrics pile up with a swamp of character agendas, some pretty poor special effects - the images of the Borderland in particular (a wasteland which doesn't support a plot point of a man believing his son is there), and composer Dominic Frontiere's infamous crescendo. When the scientist played by arch Mark Richman continually calls out ""Eva! Eva!!""to his wife (Nina Foch) it is unintentionally funny because it prefigures Evita. The standard of performance is pretty low, with a special nod to the ghastly Alfred Ryder who plays his villian as if he has had a stroke. This episode was the first filmed in the first series after the pilot The Galaxy Being, but it's broadcast was delayed for 6 months, and you'll know why. The only reason to rate it higher than a dud like Tourist Attraction, is that I found the opening image of the swirl of magnetised particles hypnotic and unexplained in the Official Companion, Richman's scientist having 2 right hands after his first attempt at cross-over (though the mutation is conveniently and amusingly concealed later on), and the fact that it features no ""bear"" ie monster that the ABC networkers demanded.",976924800,2,1599,4.947955390334572
387031,5,6301967364,"The Outer Limits Official Companion is unjustifiably harsh on this episode, which I happen to think is one of the series best. The title is a bit misleading, since it is mother nature in the form of an earthquake which is the cataylst for the mind-swap that occurs between psychoanalyst Gary Merrill and his psychotic patient, Harry Guardino, when Merrill is using a skull-cap apparatus he has devised to share thoughts. (It may be a scientific breathrough but it aint a fashion one). This set-up then allows both actors a chance to chew the scenery as the paranoid one, and surprisingly Merrill is just as funny as Guardino. Perhaps having been married to Bette Davis for 10 years has made Merrill look as haggard and ape-ish as Bogart, and his thick eyebrows and messy hair add to the believability of the mind displacement. His darting eyes are hilarious in the scene when he attempts to get access to an atomic device, and at the same time keep his true identity hidden, and the biggest laugh is when he responds to an enquiry if he is sick with ""You keep your office too warm!"". As Merrill's assistant (and not his fiancee as the Companion tells us, though she wishes!), this was Sally Kellerman's first role for TV, and she adds a Streisand-like sensuality. She would later be given a better star turn in ""The Bellero Shield"" episode, but here she gets to wear a high-collared fur-lined coat, and is given a love theme and a Garbo-esque reaction long-take. Much has been made of the huge close-up of Guardino when he first sees the guilt-induced apparition of the man he has abandoned on the frozen wasteland. This is the episodes obligatory ""monster"" though here it's lack of focus gives it a Shakespearean quality. I also like the stock icelandic footage, the aerial view of the ""TABU"" base (unfortunately, never used for a pun), the snow that doesn't attach itself to those it falls on, and the shot of an avalanche of falling rocks.",976924800,,1942,4.697947214076247

387033,4,6301967364,"The Official Companion reports that this episode ran undertime so was padded out painstakingly. This padding is noticable in the prologue and the set-up of a spaceship invaded by hitherto dormant space spores who grow into plants which emit lethal vapour. While we aren't shown how the spores managed to get inside the spaceship (one isn't likely to leave the ship door open) the naivety in which they are treated is the real surprise, probably influenced by how pretty they are and what attractive decor they make pre-vapour emittance. The spores resemble mushroom-shaped muffins, and the plants have cobra-like stems and large white petals. When a young Dabney Coleman as a botanist moves his face in for a closer inspection, we know what to expect. This episode was broadcast just after the release of the The Day of the Triffids film and the similarity (and solution to the problem) is evident, though these plants are passive-aggressive. Director Gerd Oswald provides enough suspense however to make this engaging viewing. Once the Earth base has to decide whether to allow the infected-shuttle to land or to be destroyed, the tension begins, aided by composer Dominic Frontiere's use of twittery strings to suggest both alien life and the rapid maturing of the spores into flowers with deadly stigma. This moment of decision is performed like a silent movie. Although the repair of a servomechanism of the shuttle was filmed in slow-mo to add time, the acrobatics are remarkeable, and the image of a bound corpse (the first victim of the vapour) buried in space evocatively gothic. Gail Kobe, who would later be in Keeper of the Purple Twilight, appears as the wife of one of the shuttle crew, and the only female in the cast. I suppose Oswald thought that her being in peril is more potent for the audience than the space shuttle rabbit.

387034,3,6301967364,"The Official Companion tells us that this was written for the actress Joanna Frank whom Joseph Stephano had seen and wanted to fashion an episode around, because of her unusual look - with ""those strange big-almond kind of eyes"". This look is perfect for her to play a queen bee who has been transformed into human form by her superintelligent hive in order to mate and produce hybrid offspring. Since we are told that the queen bee can produce hundreds of fertilised eggs from one mating, the hive clearly has world domination as their agenda. One might wonder how it is that entomologist Phillip abbott happened to come across the very colony of bees with a plan, as the ones whom he uses with a computer translator to study the language of bees. But then that allows the queen to communicate with the bees and for us to understand the translation. Frank is always seen with her hair over her face, sometimes with only one eye visible, which is suggestive of both her other-worldliness and her sensuality. Director John Brahm gives Frank a wonderfully erotic and gothic close-up with bees in flight superimposed over her face, though the evening gown she is transformed into is odd, particularly the way it provides her with huge falsies. No wonder Abbott is slightly distracted and his wife (Marsha Hunt - who poses like a manniquin) is unnerved. Frank sets her colony onto Hunt to turn the triangle into a couple, but we are told it wasn't the stings that killed her! The Companion tells us that the original draft had Abbott falling in love with Frank, which is the reverse of the filmed version, which would seem a better treatment since as it is, the age difference between them effects the plausibility. And in spite of Conrad Hall giving Abbott twinkly eyes, his entomologist is not a candidate to fall in love with, or to be a stud. The ending too is a worry. The Companion tells us that there were 2 versions and even the one that remains is ambiguous.  This episode is also noteworthy for being made when President Kennedy was assassinated. Perhaps this gives the image of Frank in the deceased Hunt's wedding veil an added irony.",971308800,9,2142,4.681697612732095
387035,5,6301967364,"This is one of my favorite two episodes ever of the Outer Limits.  While the plot isn't the best (alien rocks taking over people) and the effects pale in the current age of technology, the *story* is incredible--it's not about the aliens, and it's not about the science, it's about FEAR.  Fear, and love, and hope, and despair, and all the things that make us people.  And in addition to that, it's excellently filmed--high production value, incredible lighting and camera work, superb acting (Robert Culp and Salome Jens are just *cute* as young marrieds.)  Joseph Stephano is quoted as saying he didn't think it would be so Scary, and it is.  But it's not scary because of the idea or the effects, it's scary because the people are scared, and that comes across on the screen.
  If you liked this one, also check out ""Demon With a Glass Hand""--again, starring Robert Culp (ok, i happen to like Culp.  Mea Culpa).  Heavy on story, well-done enough that the more obvious plot holes can be overlooked, decent action quotient, and really good characters.",970963200,8,1052,4.767955801104972

Maybe it's just a combination of the black and white film combined with the mood music. Maybe it's the way the creature looks up from its own planet into ours. Or maybe it's the thought that this ""thing"" is ruling our own planet.

387068,5,6301967364,"No single episode can match the sheer emotional wallop of this one, basically a love story with a science fiction background.  Culp, who would be featured in several of the series' best episodes, is outstanding as the guinea pig for a top-secret plan by peace-loving scientists.  Geraldine Brooks shines as his wife who begins to realize that all is not as it appears.  Leonard Stone, as Culp's friend and fellow scientist, does well in his supporting role.
But, the fourth star of the show is the brilliant and memorable score from Dominic Frontiere.  His work on the anthology was never more poignant than it is here with its obvious love themes and dramatic ""chase"" music during the last ""act.""

387069,4,6301967364,"This is one of the better Outer Limits episodes -  well written and  directed,  with Conrad Hall replacing his usual  ""glamour""  lighting with more atmospheric brightness and shade. In the Official  Companion, Joseph Stefano comments that he didn't want to air the episode  because it was so frightening, and that's what makes it so effective - the  tightness and neo-classicism of the story-telling creates an unnerving  experience. The monsters this time around are rock samples in a geology  lab, who unknownst to the geologists - Robert Culp, Salome Jens and Barry  Atwater - are alien invaders who want to control the human  ""corpus"" ie control minds. The 2 alien rocks look pretty silly  amongst the other rocks in the lab, as they resemble dog food and pulsate  when they speak, so when Culp realises he has the ability to hear them we  can't believe that they can't be located. However there is nothing silly  about the way they expand into parasite form and attach themselves to the  human face, much like the Alien on John Hurt. The 2 scenes of attachment  are particularly horrible, one invoking a rape. The treatment is noteworthy  for the relationship between Culp and Jens as a married couple. It seems  unusual to see a husband and wife behave so tenderly with each other, in  spite of Culp thinking he is going insane. And when we see Jens in her slip  after they have (presumably) made love it feels a bit scandalous to see an  actress so unclothed. It's no coincidence that Hitchcock had Janet Leigh in  her underwear, and then naked before her demise in Psycho. There are some  minor plot holes - Culp is said to be defective to the alien's mind control  because of a metal plate in his head, yet he we see him clearly following  their instrutions in a suicide attempt, and then later being pursued by a  parasite. And one parasite seems to go missing in the climactic  confrontation. The expressionist makeup used to demonstrate a victim's  invasion is too obviously vaudeville, but the use of fire and smoke  throughout the episode is clever. And Dominic Frontiere includes some  Bernard Herrmann-ish harp in the music score.",968025600,2,2146,4.778688524590164
387070,4,6301967364,"This is one of the more reflective of the episodes, as opposed to one featuring monsters. In fact, writer Joseph Stefano called it the most  humanitarian of the series. That's not to say that there aren't monsters  because there are. It's just that they are not the focus. Perhaps Stefano  should have modified his position by saying he tried to make it the most  humanitarian, for an episode of the Outer Limits, since no episode I've  seen can be taken that seriously. The feasibility study is undertaken by  Luminoids, who have stolen a neighbourhood block and brought it back to  Luminos to see whether earthlings are suitable for (consensual) slave  labor. The Luminoids have enclosed the block in a vaporous fog and the  images of rolling dark clouds are very beautiful, especially a shot of them  enveloping a church steeple. Composer Dominic Frontiere also provides some  eerie discordant incidental music, in addition to his repertoire of  bombast. And the introductory dialogue between Ralph and Rhea Cashman is  unusually funny for this kind of show. The less said about the first scene  between Sam Wanamaker and his wife Phyllis Love, the better. The tone of  the episode changes when the Luminoids themselves make an appearance. The  premise actually recalls the ""Monsters are due on Maple Street""  episode of The Twilight Zone, except here the reaction to the threat is  different. I found the idea of the Luminoids needing slave laborers a bit  odd. I mean, what for? They claim that their lack of mobility has made  their minds evolve to levels far beyond mankind, but if this is so, one  would think neighbourhood-napping and slavery to be definitely regressive  behaviour. Unless the Luminoids world, outside the area they have  transplanted the block onto, is a decidely more happening place than the  barren wasteland we see. The human response is decided upon in the church  hall, though it seems rather undemocratic, and who voted Sam Wanamaker in  charge anyway? Of interest is something mentioned in the Outer Limits  Official Companion by David J Schow and Jeffrey Frentzen. They claim that  Stefano altered the performance of Joyce Van Patten (she plays Rhea) in the  editing room because of her incompetence. Perhaps he should have taken a  second look at Wanamaker and Love, since they both give very strange  performances, even in the context of an Outer Limits episode.

It reminded me of the way John Hurt was ""hosted"" in the  film Alien. However having this procedure didn't seem to change the  behaviour of Don Gordon who behaves the same way before and after. Perhaps  the way it effected George MacReady and Neil Hamilton (later to appear in  TV's Batman) was to make them act over-the-top. This is particularly  unsettling for MacReady, who's voice is in opposition to this kind of  performance. (Who can forget him in Gilda with Rita Hayworth). His teeth  are also noticeably odd here.

Except one: The legend  of the Gordian Knot, a knot so intricate  and convoluted that no man could untie it. For there are problems so  perplexing that they are seemingly impossible to solve, when Man  ventures  to the outer limits of his experience... 
Dewey Martin, from ""The Thing  from Another World"" and ""The Twilight Zone"" (I Shot An arrow Into the Air),  plays a test pilot who finds himself alone with his wife and stuck in a  Time No Man's Land and meets a dreadful and strange negative man (a la  ""Galaxy Being"") who was once like the couple. They must return to their  proper time and save their daughter which is on the verge of being crashed  by a truck. It's a cheap, repetitive and minor episode but fascinating due  to Ib Merchior's theme of time and the look of the monster. There are a lot  of stock shots from the US Air Force in the beginning of the episode. This  is the last one directed by Gerd Oswald. For those who like the special  effects of ""The Galaxy Being"" and the haunting sound effects of ""O.B.I.T.""  with a Twilight Zone treatment about a frozen time plotline written by  sci-fi director Ib Melchior, my advice is to watch that tale right  away!

387110,3,6301967364,"If I'd written a review for ""The Production and Decay of Strange Particles"" the first time I saw it, I would have given it 5 stars - easily! However, it was also the first time this Outer Limits episode was  shown on broadcast TV (around the same time when many Americans were  searching the night sky for the radioactive cloud, made by the Red Chinese'  first big nuke, to pass over head.)
History aside, the story takes place  in a nuclear research lab. Experiments in the creation/control of  radioactive compounds lead to the birth of a new isotope which promptly  begins its own experiment - upon the lab techs. As the new life form is  busily extending and replicating itself - with all the technicians,  assistants, and janitors try to contain the 'monster' - the big-brained  project head, an aging scientist, struggles to find the answers and the  courage to help the research team and stop the monster before it's too  late!
Like all Outer Limits stories, you have to swallow hard to accept  some of the premises, still, two points make this episode special.
1. The  characters in the script were ahead of their social time. Our cowardly hero  is an educated man and knows he has already absorbed more than a lifetime's  worth of 'safe' rads - his wife, strong-willed and out-spoken. Many (if not  most) Americans at that time were quite the opposite. ""A woman's place  was (still) in the home"" just like ""Duck and Cover"" was the  best way to survive ""The Bomb""! (Few were beginning to accept,  though not fully understand, the M.A.D. (Mutually Assured Destruction)  scenario.)
2. (IF I remember correctly) This is the first of two Outer  Limits episodes in which He appeared, and (again, IF I'm correct) it was  the first time he spoke (one line, all four words) on any TV show.

An alien scientist from planet Chromo is teleported  on Earth and soon the convict will be sent out there. Forget the storyline  and focus on the characters. Henry Silva, from ""Tourist  Attraction"", is jumpy Chino Rivera, for instance : in the scene where  Chino, scared to death by the Chromoite, runs in a hurry.  We can see a  long dolly shot made with a hand-held camera  and we can hear a military  music to emphasize the tension. Michael Higgins is dead-serious scientist  Dr. Thomas Kellander : especially, after the alien's very violent murder in  the lake, he speaks of Chino to Julia while watching a shoe :  ""A  disease that walks like a man..."". Diane Sands is frightened Dr. Julia  Harrison (and a small part by Dabney Coleman). I like the friendly  dialogues between Julia and Chino, when they talk about Chromo's food :  ""I'd better bring a couple of hero sandwiches with me."" And when  they talk about the horror of the Chromoite : ""Everybody looks like a  monster to somebody."" The cinematography is dark and effective due to  Conrad Hall's tough hand held camera shots. One of the best chiaroscuro  shot is when Chino is reading near the mice' cages.  The very  science-fiction music blends with O.B.I.T.'s haunting sound effects is  okay. The Chromoite alien is evil (in the teleportation scene when it turns  insane and agressive and destroys everything) and repulsive-enough (the way  it eats)  to watch the show.

The alien's optical effects  is strange and magnificient at once and it is the best ""bear"" of  the entire series. There are two beautiful scenes with the negative effects  :  1. The Being enters a shop, with suspended instruments,  and examines  items (binoculars, musical box, bust).  2. The Being cauterized the injury  of Allan Maxwell's wife  with a blast of radiation. You have a ""The  day the Earth stood still"" reference with the army, the jeeps and the  alien's warning (""There is much you have to  learn."").----""The planet Earth is a speck of dust, remote and  alone in the void. There are powers in the universe inscrutable and  profound.  Fear cannot save us. Rage cannot help us. We must see the  stranger in a new light-the light of understanding.

He goes to the house, which is a huge brain, to get some help. Post-""The big  heat"" Gloria Grahame plays a vamp actress from the twenties, like a  soft version of Myriam Hopkins from ""Don't open till doomsday"".  She and the old and odd couple (""Shut-up Randall or I'll be nice to  you !"")  tries to corrupt Geoffrey Horne as Wade Norton  (""I feel  as if I'm having a bad dream !"") in vain. Rebel Wade Norton  (""Never interrogate the wind !"") meets  Luane Anders as shy Tess  in the most sensitive love affair of the series. The brain monster is  fascinating. It has the same voice as the Senator from ""Fun and  games"" and it is a recycled part from ""The mice"".  It  explores human condition like a mathematician  when it compares the  positive (procreation, work, faith, art) and the negative factor  (destruction, fear, hopelessness, hate [symbolized by an Atom bomb]). You  have a magnificient optical effects when the giant brain is seen with a  fast-moving clouds background just like in the work of cinematographer  Nicholas Musuraca. The music is interesting too because it is a blend of  scores  from ""Nightmare"" and the haunting sound from  ""O.B.I.T."". Only the scene of Wade Norton saying : ""No ,  Tess, come back !"" and Tess leaving the house is a new and touching  music. But the details I like the most is the maze of dark empty rooms  which leads to nowhere. A landmark episode with a subtle story,  existentialist characters  (""Close your eyes to illusion. Love is out  there !"") and a gothic approach  not shot by Conrad Hall about the  theme of dream.",928022400,12,1701,4.526490066225166

Only here, in the void of space, is there a new  source of atomic power. Above us, in the debris of the solar system, in the  meteorites and asteroids, are the materials needed to drive the reactors.

A meek and mild  professor invents a device that can control  all the sources of energy and  the forces that surround us.

I like the very quiet man who  turns angry and hysterical  as Jeff Corey in the end of  ""O.B.I.T."". Conrad Hall's cinematography is outstanding as  always. Watch the chiaroscuro close-ups of Donald Pleasence out. The mind  power test when the dials become mad is very bizarre. The dark clouds and  lightning visual effects, that symbolizes  Donald Pleasence's avenging  subconscious, are brilliant. Remember the character of Dr. Morbius/Id from  ""Forbidden planet"". All the characters are great : the shrewish  wife, Edward C. Platt as the authoritarian boss from University (the first  attempt to kill him is fun),  John Marley as the dead-serious psychiatrist.  The operating room mood is really Expressionist and you can recapture the  same scary feeling as in ""The architects of fear"". The best  episode directed by ""The wild one"" Laslo Benedek  and the single  script written by ""Mission : impossible"" Jerome Ross. ""Deep  beyond the kindest, gentlest soul may lurk violent thoughts, deadly wishes.  Someday Man will learn to cope with the monsters of the mind.

He is, in this  present year, thirty years old. This is the first time he has made this  journey alone..."" A microbe destroys humanity. Librarian Andro tries  to change the past with the help of an astronaut. First-rate actor Martin  Landau plays the nostalgic mutant Andro (""It's good to cherish old  things... Beauty is always on the edge of being lost.""). I like the  scene in the library when astronaut Joseph Reardon says : ""Melville.  Hope proves a man deathless."" And when he goes back to the  time-portal, turns negative and says : ""Find Cabot ! Kill him if you  have to ! Kill Cabot !"". Baby face Shirley Knight plays innocent Noel  who is as gracious as a fairy. I like the whole cinematic aspect of this  peculiar episode. Conrad Hall and his uncredited assistant William Fraker  makes their most  romantic cameraworks. They capture the magic sense of  nature : the chase scene, in the wood, shot with a hand-held camera through  leafs and trees.  There are many reflection shots, for instance :  the  camera's reflection in the beginning of the wedding. The close-ups of  Landau's snake eyes are magnificient when he is paying the landlady with  imaginary money. And when he tells his past memories to Noel : the stylish  montage (a chiarusco on the face,  fade overlaped to fast-moving shiny  clouds  and the futuristic barren landscape) that cinematographer Nicholas  Musuraca uses in ""Clash by night"". This is also a sensitive  tribute to Beauty and the Beast  with a sci-fi treatment. ""It is said  that if you move a single pebble on the beach, you set up a different  pattern, and everything in the world is changed. It can also be said that  love can change the future, if it is deep enough, true enough, and selfless  enough.

Landau delivers brilliant lines  against his father : ""Call, call, call whom ? The police, the leading  scientitists of the world, ...

The reference to the Scandinavian  mythology (""the trembling way"") is marvelous  and Sally  Kellerman, from ""The human factor"", is Machiavellian  when she  shoots a Champagne's bottle with a laser pistol : a symbol of power. Neil  Hamilton, from ""The invisibles"", is noble and dignified  (""Great men are forgiven their muderous wife.""). John Hoyt, from  ""Don't open till doomsday"", as the Bifrost alien,  who learns  foreign language through eye contact, is as benevolant  as the one in  ""The galaxy being"". Chita Rivera, as the barefoot servant, is  diabolical when she gives a small gun,  extract from her garter, to Sally  Kellerman. Conrad Hall's supreme cinematography is gothic and classical at  once : the wine cellar is beautiful with its high chiaroscuro look,  the  lab mood is great with the close-ups of the dials' machines and the  close-up of Sally Kellerman's hand which symbolizes her insanity. This is a  play and the best episode directed by John Brahm (""The lodger/Hangover  square""). It's all about the universal theme of greed (love, ambition,  murder and madness). Greed always breeds the best drama in every art forms,  remember Shakespeare : ""Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny;  it hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne, And fall of many  kings..."" - The Tragedy of MacBeth, MacDuff, Act IV.

His condition  drives him insane and he torments his crewmen into remaining on the planet  to keep him company.
