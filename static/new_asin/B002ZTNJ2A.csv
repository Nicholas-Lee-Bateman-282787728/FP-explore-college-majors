4042304,4,B002ZTNJ2A,I had searched for a long time for this movie because I was always intrigued by the scenario.  I first saw the trailer at the Drive-In theater when I was a kid. But never through the years had I the privilege to view it in its entirety. Well i was not disappointed by what I saw. Its a great SciFi thriller even though a little vague in theory.  Well worth the price and the time spent searching for it.  Don't expect the CGI effects in this one because they didn't have it. Still all in all it was fairly well done.,1280534400,3,516,4.089108910891089
4042305,3,B002ZTNJ2A,"This is not an easy movie to rate. Considering it was released in 1965 it's not difficult to imagine this was really something in its day. The concept and scope must have wowed people. The problem as I see it is it didn't withstand the test of time. As science and technology progress the average person's thinking becomes more sophisticated and this movie then seems naive.

Dana Andrews wants to bore to the magma level inside the earth and control it to give the world free energy forever. He drills as far as he can but gets held up at one point and figures to use a nuclear device to break through. A fellow scientist warns him that he might do irreparable damage. He does so anyway and begins to crack the earth's crust. Now the race is on to fix things before the earth splits in half.

As I said. At the time this might have been pretty good but I couldn't get into it at any level. I haven't seen Dana Andrews in too many films but he did not impress me here. Neither did the rest of the cast. The acting was stilted. The direction was hack level at best. A scene where they are lowering a nuclear device into a volcano to relieve pressure and stop the cracking bordered on boring. The production and set design was OK but could have been a lot better. The design and rendering of the logo depicting the project looked as though it were done by someone in grade school. The wardrobe didn't impress me much either. Somehow, seeing Dana Andrews in a suit 2 miles below the earth's surface, struck me a stupid.

The film industry has put great emphasis on science fiction and speculative fiction over the years and, as a result, these types of movies have grown exponentially in their sophistication. As good as this might have been in its day, it's not such a much now.",1280534400,2,1776,4.375757575757576
4042306,4,B002ZTNJ2A,"CRACK IN THE WORLD finally makes its home video debut via this new widescreen DVD from Olive Films.  Olive Films is a relatively new enterprise that has leased several Paramount titles for home video release.

I hadn't seen CRACK IN THE WORLD since its initial 1965 theatrical exhibition, and so it was great to be able to revisit it.  What seemed like pure fantasy back then now feels all too plausible, given the daily reports about BP and the events on the Gulf coast.  It's an engrossing story about scientists who have drilled too far into the earth's core, setting off a cataclysmic chain of events.  Stalwart scientist Dana Andrews attempts to reverse the process.  The film builds to a nearly apocalyptic finale, aided by some pretty good special effects.

The DVD preserves the film's 1:85-1 aspect ratio.  The transfer is very good, although the age of the film elements precludes the movie from looking ""as though it was filmed yesterday.""  I'd guess that the DVD was struck from a very good 35mm print, rather than from the original camera negative.  There are no supplements, but the home video debut of CRACK IN THE WORLD is reason enough for celebration.  Hopefully, Olive Films will resurrect other titles that have fallen through the cracks of the world of films.",1280188800,8,1280,4.825688073394495
4042307,5,B002ZTNJ2A,"I too am a great fan of this movie. I spent years looking for it, and about 3 months ago, I found a very watchable version at a site when I Googled it. The disc only cost $10....but. About half way through, down in the lower right hand corner the symbol ""AMC"" popped up and I realized that it was just a good copy made from the American Movie Classic channel.

This version that is now being released should be far superior....and I look forward to it.

If you have not seen this movie, by all means give it a try. There is not a single wasted minute in the whole film. Excellent!",1280102400,42,580,4.123893805309734
4042308,4,B002ZTNJ2A,"Interesting story about a dying scientist who plans to tap the geothermal energy beneath the Earth's crust, with dire consequences. Andrews, Scott and Moore, as well as Alexander Knox, all give excellent performances. Special effects are superb and very believable. I remember seeing this on TV when I was little, and it scared me to DEATH. Seeing it again as an adult, it is not quite as scary, but is still fast-paced and entertaining.

While the science is now dated, thanks to the discovery of plate tectonics (the Earth's crust is divided into may separate ""plates"", and therefore already has many ""cracks""), the story is still entertaining. The interaction between Dr. Sorenson (Andrews), an aging scientist trying for one last victory; his young wife Maggie (Scott), a scientist in her own right; and Dr. Rampion (Moore), the project's geologist and an old flame of Maggie's to boot; works very well, even if it is a bit formulaic.

All in all it is a fun movie, and definitely worth the time to see it. Especially now that it is finally being released on DVD in its original 1.85:1 widescreen format. A worthy addition to any classic sci-fi film collection.

(PS: *I* wrote that summary listed on the back cover when I was in college! They just added a few extra words. Don't believe me? Look it up on IMDB!!)",1280016000,78,1317,4.767543859649122
4042309,2,B002ZTNJ2A,"The plot of Crack in the World is pretty simple (and cliched): Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews) plans to tap the geothermal energy of the Earth's interior by detonating a thermonuclear device deep within the Earth despite the dire warnings of Scientist Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore). Naturally, things go wrong and the Earth's crust cracks, threatening to split the planet in half. Millions die and dozens overact as doomsday approaches. Add to that the fact that Andrews is dying of cancer and that Moore is in love with Andrews' young pretty wife Maggie (Janette Scott) and suddenly Irwin Allen and Roland Emmerich look like masters of subtlety in comparison.

I saw Crack in the World when I was ten on TV. It's pretty bad when, even at that young age, you realize just how stupid the plot and dialogue really are. At one point, the audience is treated to this exchange:

Sir Charles Eggerston (Alexander Knox): The question now is not who is to blame, but how we can stop the catastrophe.
Dr. Ted Rampion: At present we don't know any way we can stop it. First, we have to learn to understand the natural forces involved, and if possible, find some way to control them in the time that is permitted to us.
Sir Charles Eggerston: What is being done? Now?
Dr. Ted Rampion: Every university, every scientist, every thinking military leader is helping us.
Sir Charles Eggerston: Is there anything that we can do?
Dr. Ted Rampion: Pray.

Not exactly All About Eve quality dialogue, is it? I certainly wasn't unusually sophisticated or mature for my age, but even back then I rolled my eyes and laughed.

But for me, the highlight of the movie -- the scene that transformed Crack in the World from a serious sci-fi/disaster film to an unintentional comedy -- was when Moore devises a plan to stop the crack. How does he attempt to save the world? No, not by using a giant band-aid, but by detonating another nuclear weapon in the path of the advancing crack. In this sequence, Moore demonstrates his plan with a large piece of plywood with a circle cut in the center. Theoretically, Moore states, the crack will stop when it reaches the large hole caused by the second nuclear explosion. As a ten year old, I remember watching the scene and saying out loud, ""That's stupid -- won't the explosion just cause the crack to move faster?"" Not that I claim to be smarter than any scientist -- even a fictitious scientist -- but this plan seemed akin to trying to stop the bleeding by sticking a razor blade into the wound. Sure enough, the crack accelerates and a large chunk of the Earth splits off forming a new moon. Of course, I learned later than with the tectonic plates, the Earth's surface is full of cracks already and that gravity would prevent a chunk of the planet's surface to split off. However, even with the limited knowledge I had at that early age, I already realized just how ridiculous the plot was.

Andrews, of course, was in classics like Laura and The Best Years of Our Lives. Moore and Scott were together in the far superior Day of the Triffids. The director, Andrew Marton, helmed The Longest Day and was a second unit director on Ben-Hur, Catch-22, Kelly's Heroes, and The Day of the Jackal. In other words, Crack in the World isn't something that would rank high on the resume of anyone involved. In the annals of unintentional comedy, however, it's a masterpiece.",1278374400,12,3385,4.653846153846154

4042313,5,B002ZTNJ2A,"This movie is long overdue to be released as a DVD. This wonderfully fresh, innovative sci-fi movie from 1965 was a top quality movie with excellent acting. Even though it was not a US film... you would never know it to see it. I had no idea until I read it. There is no hint of this movie being made outside of the US. This movie has the same excellent quality as Forbidden Planet.

The unique storyline has scientists using nuclear detonations to drill a hole to the Earth's core to tap the geothermal energy of the magma. But the explosion was unexpectedly magnified, cracking the mantle and crust which began to rapidly spread across the planet. Efforts to stop the cracking of the crust only changed the direction of the rapidly spreading crack which eventually comes full circle and ejecting an entire section of the earth into space. There have been rare few movies made over the last 30 years with such excellent production quality as seen in this movie. Clearly, showing how an excellent movie can be made without a blockbuster budget when real talent is involved. The movie, storyline, acting and special effects are very realistic and believable.

Dana Andrews, Janette Scott and Kieron Moore did superb jobs of acting. The direction and special effects were excellent. The only part I did not care for was the portion of the storyline of the younger scientist trying to steal the wife of the older scientist... simply because the husband was older than the wife... The movie would have been even better without that triangle... and since the husband was also dying of cancer, it was just plain disrepectful of the younger scientist to be hitting on the wife in plain sight of the husband in that callous manner. That should have been eliminated from the script. Other than that, the movie was perfect and I have nothing but praise for it.

I love this movie. I have been looking everywhere for it. Up until now, they didn't even have a listing on Amazon for this movie... and I've been looking this movie since Amazon first went into business. I simply could not believe that no one has released this movie yet. It is a classic and I'm lucky that I taped this movie on VHS back in the 80's, otherwise, I would not have a copy of it, but if you haven't seen it, you are missing one of the best classic Sci-fi movies with a fresh, unique storyline unlike any other. It is excellent production quality and excellent acting. I would have loved to have seen a sequel or at least another hour of the movie. I'm amazed that these ""present day"" copycat remake directors (who can't seem to come up with any original ideas of their own) have not decided to make another modern version of this movie.

And knowing how the XGen seems to hate everything their parents loved and take such great delight in tearing down anything of quality... I can already anticipate their attempt to disparage this movie. Best advice is don't listen to the opinion of some computer junkie still in diapers who wouldn't know a quality movie if it was filmed on their doorstep.

This is a great movie and I hope they release it soon. We have waiting far too long. There was no excuse for Amazon not even having a listing for this movie all these years. I was shocked when I finally saw this entry for it after all these years. I think Amazon should include a vote counter so we can request movies we are looking for. Perhaps they can start sharing the requests and customer demand for these movies with the owners of these films to get them out on DVD for us.",1265587200,11,3539,4.549450549450549

4042341,4,B002ZTNJ2A,"First impressions....can be misleading.  Yes, this movie gets mercilessly pounded by many, who presume films made over a half century ago should reflect current social values, cultural mores and have state of the art CGI level special effects.  And because the cast is made up of actors completely unknown to most people under  40 or so, its immediately diminished  as a so-called silly old B movie.

Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.

Yes, thats both the message of this film and how I feel about most online reviews of it.  For those old enough to remember watching this movie when it was released during their childhood, the reality was different.

It scared the living you know what out of most of us.

How so?  Well unlike other previous end of the world films, this one did not base the storyline on attacks by aliens, monsters or a worldwide war.  Instead, the scriptwriters came up with a concept that was simple, believable, novel and terrifying: our planet could come to an end. just through the well- intended but inappropriate use of existing technology.  And no, at a time when astronauts were already orbiting the earth, the notion of drilling a hole into the middle of it to access unlimited geothermal energy certainly didn't seem like something outside the realm of possibility.  Albeit yes,  Ill admit the upside down rocket with an atomic warhead was stretching things a bit even back then.

The other thing to understand is that irrespective of a superfluous romantic triangle element and a somewhat dated ""world leaders in solemn discussion in fancy conference room"" scene, this show really does become riveting in the last half hour.  By that point it is clear the catastrophic side effect of the ambitious attempt to harness geothermal energy has spiraled out of control, with the the film then taking  the viewer into a nightmarish journey of desperation, heartbreak, flight and death.  That leads to a climax set in a red and black landscape where the primary characters meet their fates.  All in all, you experience one of the better presentations of a cataclysmic end-of-the-world scenario that had been put on film to that point in time (yes, even more frightening than the excellent one in the original 1953 version of War of The Worlds).

And in closing, a footnote: as of the time of this review (April 2017), a team of international scientists is proceeding with a $1 billion plan. to drill a six mile deep hole into the mantle of the earth (yes, if you don't believe me, go ahead and google it).

Not sure why the illness subplot for the main character has to be there as it really does not add much value to the story.

The film is generally compelling but the finale is hurt by ancient and sub-par special effects.

The ending could have been extended to show what the results were to the Earth in more detail.

4042432,4,B002ZTNJ2A,"Though dated, this was a fairly good telling of a disaster story. The main idea behind the plot--shoot a rocket with a nuclear warhead into the center of the earth--has a 1960's James Bond feel to it. In fact, the rocket gantry set looked like something out of Sean Connery James Bond movie, as did the Inner Space research center.

The acting was solid and the pacing was just about right.

The special effects are impressive for that era. The weakest one was the nuclear destruction of an atoll, though I suppose for viewers in 1965 it would have been impressive. I was especially taken by the excellent sound quality. I have a surround sound system with a subwoofer and for a movie from 1965, it sounded great. Actually, it sounded great no matter from whatever era.

Not only was it not scary, but was pretty good for a 60's sci-fi movie. Yeah it has cheesy sub plots. I couldn't follow them, but was not paying much attention during the movie.

4042554,3,B002ZTNJ2A,"It left me wondering why I'd bothered to watch it.  It is well produced and maybe I might have enjoyed it if I'd watched it in the 60s. but viewed from the perspective a half century later, the science and sociology are both dated, the characters are stereotypes, and the story is thin.  However the questions of the responsibility of a scientist to the world versus his own ambitions and of governments in what they do to the planet are if anything more relevant today.

The most irritating thing to me about this film was the role of Dr. Maggie Sorenson.  She's said to be a noted scientist, but she never acts like one.  Her main roles are as the wife of one scientist and the lover of another.  This of course reflects the attitudes of the era when the film was produced, and this film was in fact probably progressive in even calling her a scientist, so I'm not holding it against the film.  This was the era after all when Star Trek producers thought it was enough to put a woman in a mini skirt on the bridge of the Enterprise but not give her any significant responsibility.

Overall it held my interest enough that I kept watching, but barely.",1434153600,2,1152,4.400943396226415

Love triangle, slowly simmering female lead that quietly approaches critical mass toward the final scene where she is just about on fire!  Add one Ignorable British male hunk actor/ action hero to complete the triangle and you've got a subplot.  Plus, some artfully applied volcano b-roll, odd scenes from around the world in panic, interlaced with your average quality b-movie miniature effects, gives this movie everything it needs to satisfy those caramel corn cravings for prime quiche.

The setting off of the underground nuclear blast and the devastation that follows is charted in an intelligent and rather alarming manner and even with the limited special-effects technology of the 1960s it still leaves one feeling very shaky under one's feet, especially with the knowledge that underground nuclear blasts have been set off in reality. I was 10 or 11 years old when I furst saw this movie on the old black-and-white television and it scared me that much it pretty much sent me mute for a week! The only slow-point in the movie for me is the soap-opera luv-triangle subtext between Sorenson, his wife and Rampion but this small drawback is well-and-truly surpassed by the movie as a whole. Spookily, about an hour SW of where I live here in New South Wales (Australia), the M31 motorway that heds inland toward Goulburn passes thru countryside that was created by molten rock and there's a well-signposted side-road off the motorway there called ""Rampion Hills Road"", sh-shudders...",1425859200,,1163,4.908629441624366

4042610,5,B002ZTNJ2A,"When I was a teenager and went to see this movie I immediately realized that this was indeed a true sleeper. I went to the theater on a Saturday afternoon expecting to see the usual B-movie sci-fi claptrap and ended up being completely surprised. Here was a movie with good actors, good script, color, widescreen and exceptional special effects (especially in 1965). This movie for me was the cats meow, it was bold in its story telling and bordered on epic in its visual presentation. When I left the theater that day I definitely felt that I had gotten my monies worth.
But after its theatrical run ""Crack in the World"" fell into obscurity. I have only seen it once on television and that was late at night  back in 1978.
The era of VHS came and went without ""Crack in the World"" ever being released. Then the era of DVDs came along and I felt sure that it would finally get its well deserved release but as the years passed by my hopes were fading. Then in 2010 Olive Films finally releases ""Crack in the World"".

Moore is so genuine and Scott is so virtuous that I found myself cheering for ""the crack"" so that Dana Andrews would be humiliated and discredited.  I was not disappointed.  How many films of this genre have the courage to end the way this one does?  The good scientist fails to stop the crack, the bad scientist becomes a hero by choosing to sacrifice himself to his creation, and the earth sacrifices a big chunk of itself so as to give birth to a second moon.

Even better the two leads (other than Dana Andrews), Kieron Moore and Janette Scott are the same two actors who staved off the Triffids in the lighthouse in the move Day of the Triffids.  They have definite magnetism and I've always enjoyed watching them.

That said, don't expect Oscar performances, and be prepared to laugh at some of the histrionics.

I first saw it in the movie theatres at the age of 9 in 1965 and loved it, but never saw it again on TV in all those years since. Watching it now makes me wonder if it hit too close to something meant to stay unknown, which would explain why TV stations rarely, if ever, replayed it. The events with earthquakes over the last decade (Indonesia, Fukashima) certainly come to mind.  We don't need this classic updated,  just watch it again as is.

4042677,5,B002ZTNJ2A,"""Crack in the World"" was much better than I expected.  I assumed from the B&W picture and lack of description that this was a 1950s era movie.  I'm pretty sure it must be more mid-1960s.  It's in color with 1960s level quality.

The movie itself follows the almost cliche ""not-quite-mad scientist"" as he attempts to solve the world's energy demands by drilling a hole into the core of the Earth.  Unlike many ""mad scientist"" movies, this man isn't a typical antagonist, neither insane nor stupid.  He'd just...driven.  (No more about that.  No spoilers.)

You can guess from the title what happens.  Yes, poor Earth is no longer what it was cracked up to be.  (Groan!)

The science in the movie is somewhat weak, though it is loosely based on theories in the 1950s and 60s.  That's entertainment by itself, no slam to those who gave us the foundation of why we know now how silly it is.

Good miniature work as well as opticals for the day; and of course... the obligatory 'stock footage'. Especially charming is the dialogue which makes one wonder... Did anyone, ever, really talk like this? (Well, maybe Dana Andrews did). I remember seeing this on TV years ago when I was much younger and a lot more impressionable so I'm not surprised it left me a bit lacking in the ""WOW"" factor when watching it this time but it's still entertaining enough to spend 96 minutes 'pretending' and should be on the watch list of any serious long-time follower of the genre.",1400025600,2,945,4.468208092485549

4042692,5,B002ZTNJ2A,"First I should say that Crack in the World is a fun movie.  It's fast paced, well written, tightly edited, and reasonably well acted. (Not a lot is required of the actors, but they play their parts well.)

Second, I should confess that I originally saw it when I was 12 or thereabouts, so my perceptions may be colored by that bit of personal history. It's a good, straightforward SF story, the sort often appreciated by boys of that age.  I liked it then, and still like it now.

In some ways it surpasses what one would expect from its genre, particularly when you compare it to other minor-studio SF movies produced and filmed in the 1960s.  It's effective as a science fiction disaster movie, and also works well as a relationship drama. I have to say I like the character of Maggie, with her unapologetic and unconcealed love of two different men.

One reviewer criticized the movie for suggesting that an explosive device fired down into the earth, hitting pockets of hydrogen, could set off a hydrogen-bomb reaction.  This is a valid criticism, and a glaring weakness in the storyline. It could have been avoided by simply saying that the hydrogen ignited, as it is flammable and explosive.

The notion of scientists doing stupid (risky) experiments motivated by either ego or the profit motive is, unfortunately, also plausible.  So some of the science in the movie is borderline believable.

Apart from that, the science in the movie is reasonably straightforward. But it does have one logic problem that's difficult to overlook. Before discussing it though, here's a SPOILER ALERT: the end of this review reveals the end of the movie.  Read below the asterisks at your own risk.

***********************************

So here's the SPOILER, and the problem:

***********************************

Let's say an event took place on Earth that was catastrophic enough to rip a sizable chunk of the planet, hundreds of miles across and who knows how deep, free; hurtle it into space with the violence necessary to escape the earth's gravitational field; and create a new moon.

What effect would the event, and the loss of a massive chunk of the world, have on the rest of the Earth?

What effect would a second (burning) moon in the sky have on the atmosphere, and on the tides?

If a huge chunk of our planet were torn free, could life as we know it possibly continue?  Wouldn't oceans and continents slam in, driven by the earth's rotation, to fill the part that had been torn free, and make the globe round again?  Wouldn't the Earth gyrate on its axis, trying to find a new rotational equilibrium?  Wouldn't cities and populations be buried, asphixiated and drowned in such a catastrophe?

How could anyone survive an event like that, either on the part of the Earth that remained intact, or the part torn free?

The movie makes it clear that the new ""moon"" is molten.  No life there. And these questions are raised, briefly, but they're dispensed with when the movie ends. A huge chunk of the earth tears free, and is propelled into orbit.  The problem is that life seems to go on as usual a few hundred feet from where the even occurred. This is hard to accept, even giving the screenwriter some dramatic license. If a massive chunk of our planet, hundreds of thousands of miles across, were ripped free, ignited, and went hurtling into the sky, at the very least it would create a scorched earth effect for a vast distance around.  It's also questionable whether our atmosphere would remain intact and breathable after such an event, as appears to be the case at the end. (Though maybe after the credits rolled and the screen went black, the hero and heroine fell over dead... you never know!)

Still ""Crack in the World"" is fun.  It's also a perfect period piece, a better-than-average SF movie of the 1960s.  I'm giving it five stars mainly because it's a wild ride and a novel scenario.  It's also a valid cautionary tale, in spite of the story's scientific flaws.",1397260800,,3979,4.75801749271137
4042693,4,B002ZTNJ2A,"Give this movie a chance.

4042702,2,B002ZTNJ2A,"Dana Andrews, whose rather interesting career was winding down at this point, tries mightily to make a go of it with an absurd plot and bad special effects about a scientist who is planning to explode a bomb deep beneath the earths surface to tap into the free heat generated as you move closer to the earths core. Think of it as creating volcano, and then thinking that you can control the volcano like the spigot on a sink by allowing more or less lava flow to the surface and then tapping the heat from the lava to generate electricity or whatever. I can't imagine that technology ever being available, but whatever, these guys are trying. Of course this faction of scientists is diametrically opposed by the 'you're mad! you're going to crack the world in half!' scientists. If you can remember the name of the movie you'll be able to guess who is correct. Add to that a woman who's married to the Dana Andrews character but was previously in a relationship with the head scientist who's OPPOSED to the Dana Andrews character and you can imagine the emotional fireworks that ensue. The science is, of course, ridiculous. The special effects while, not the worst (they generally use old newsreels of volcanic eruptions) are just basic lava flows. The acting is passable but the scenery is somewhat interesting - I thought it was filmed in Africa but it turns out it was all filmed in Spain.
 As a side note, if you're looking for an interesting and actually quite frightening Dana Andrews movie check out his 1957 flick 'Curse of the Demon'.  If you still need another Dana Andrews movie after that check out his (also) 1957 movie 'Zero Hour!' which was used, and parodied hilariously, in the  movie 'Airplane!' about 25 years later.",1394150400,,1736,4.685245901639345

It was a fave on TV when I was a really young dorky kid, it was warm/fuzzy nostalgia that more or less had me jumping at the chance to see it again.  Kieron Moore overacts like no soap opera star ever, sleepy-eyed Janette Scott sure could use some of Moore's excess enthusiasm, and how a stodgy, ol' scientist like Dana Andrews managed a young trophy wife like Scott is the real mystery here.  Nonetheless, I still love this commonly overlooked sci-fi lower-tier classic.

The story is hogwash from a scientific point of view, but when this was made it was still sort of plausible. I enjoyed the pairing of husband/wife Kieron Moore & Janette Scott in ""The Day of The Triffids,"" so I was originally drawn to this film to see them team up again. Dana Andrews makes for a kind of wormy martyr as Scott's over-the-hill husband/scientist, but he plays the part nicely and he gets to go out with a bang. Pretty good F/X for the time period. Some jolts to keep your attention. All in all, a fun time-waster on a rainy afternoon and suitable for the whole family. This Olive Films DVD release looks very good, much better than any previous version I've had. Colors are lush and rich, picture is crisp & clean and the sound thunders in all the right places with no tinny hollowness that often plagues older films.

Several decades have done great damage to that opinion; the special effects seem very contrived and of course, the science laughable. Still credit has to go to the director for trying to fit a complicated and relevant story into the budget for time and resources given. That however, means some cliche'd scenes and resolutions.

Which is apparently quite deadly - no matter how much it looks like a blob of makeup.  He applies some prehistoric and extremely ineffective treatment to the rash, and then - through no fault of his own - ignores it until it spreads throughout his entire body.  Had this man been born anytime after the invention of Standing Upright, he might have survived.  They would have, no doubt, removed the hand to save his life.  But as I have mentioned, these were not modern times.  Therefore, he is heading for the Big Sleep, and since he is in charge of the world and somehow happens to have an ancient but effective 10 megaton nuke at his disposal, he decides to use it.  I mean, why not?  He's going to be dead in a few months.  And ""months"" were not invented yet.  Why should he care?  So he lets her fly.  The result, of course, is that it creates a ginormous Crack in the World, and blah blah ... the Crack eats everyone and they all live happily ever after.

Oh, why didn't they listen to Dr. Ted Rampian (Kieron Moore) instead of a daft old geezer (Dana Andrews) quick to gain immortality alongside Einstein et al?  Well, if they had this movie would have been a whole lot shorter.  Instead, we have 96 minutes of a fickle two timing hussy (Janette Scott), ex-girlfriend of Dr. Rampian, current wife to the sick and dying megalomaniac Dr. Steven Sorenson (Andrews).  Yes, this movie features a torrid triangle (of sorts), although no one seems all that keen to make it more than just ancient history.  Pity, this movie could have used a little spice.  Instead, there's a lot of pseudo-science, sheer PANIC, and some snazzy special effects.  The project, of course, goes horribly wrong and it's up to poor jilted Rampian to save the day.....or as much of the Earth as possible.
As disaster movies go, this one isn't that bad.  Although it is more of a one-character study (Dana Andrews) than anything else.  A lot of the plot centers around this one character's last stand, the rest of the cast are there to support that and to act as plot devices (few are memorable).  A bit of the ensuing catastrophe is depicted (notably, a train wreck).  A little more would have been appreciated.  All in all, it's quite effective.

4042752,3,B002ZTNJ2A,"CRACK IN THE WORLD has a somewhat bizarre plot.  Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews, looking very distinguished with silver hair) plans to drill a hole to the earth's molten center and use the magma's heat to provide unlimited power to the people of the world.  Unfortunately, he has run afoul of an impenetrable layer--and in order to get through it, he coaxes an atomic bomb out of his sponsors.  Collegue Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore, very studly with bulging muscles) thinks this might not be a good idea, and when Sorenson does in fact release the bomb Rampion is ultimately proved right: the bomb doesn't just blow a hole in the earth's mantle, it cracks it, and the crack begins to spread, causing widespread devastation and the possibility of the end of the world as we know it.

When the two men are not arguing over what to do next, they are arguing over Maggie (Janette Scott), who is married to Sorenson but used to date Rampion.  The script is very talky, the romantic subplot is predictable at best, and the special effects aren't particularly special.  The film has a few great sets, but its miniture sets are obvious, it has a lot of stock footage of volcanoes and atomic bombs, and there's a lot of red lighting to imply the proximity of lava.  Even so, CRACK IN THE WORLD isn't a bad movie.  The three leads are quite good and carry the whole thing very well, and although the romantic elements occasionally slow everything down to a crawl, overall the movie has a fairly good pace.  The DVD has no extras, but the visual and sound elements are very good.  Worth watching once; don't expect too much and you'll probably enjoy it.

4042754,4,B002ZTNJ2A,"It's awesome that the filmmakers behind this British/American co-production pegged our modern day energy crisis worries back in 1965.  Director Andrew Marton's 'CRACK IN THE WORLD'-1965 is a prophetic vision of scientists trying to utilize the energy of the Earth's interior to bypass such companies as PSE&G and CON-ED but of course it backfires.  Actors Dana Andrews, Janette Scott, and Kieron Moore form a soap opera backdrop to the proceedings that bogs down the action and would thematically continue to do so in the disaster epics which followed in the Seventies.  Andrews is dying of cancer and adapts an anything goes attitude causing the crack in the title.  The film emerges as a product of missed opportunities by concentrating on the barking back and forth between our actors as the script by Jon Manship White and Julian Harvey buries some intriguing possibilities in the science of the crisis.  Their are elements, however, which elevate the proceeding by an extremely impressive music score by John Douglas and the awesome beauty of the special effects and art direction by the master Eugene Lourie who helmed the best of the giant monster movies in the fifties and early sixties.  Director Marton who is no slouch to this type of film having lensed numerous action and war movies and would go on to direct 'AROUND THE WORLD UNDER THE SEA' the next year directs adequately especially the nail biting climax as the true horror of the situation hits home. We see a harrowing train wreck and avalanches all done with realistic looking miniatures as Moore and Scott try to get back to their lab. The climax ends with the same theme throughout, soap opera and corn.  Olive films deserve kudos for a flawless 1.85 transfer with crystal clear sound.  I did not see the Blu-Ray release but I can't see how it can improve on this DVD.  For Sci-Fi fanatics, it still is a nice diversion for a Saturday afternoon.",1330128000,4,1917,4.855828220858895
4042755,4,B002ZTNJ2A,"This was one of the very few cerebral science-fiction movies made in the 50s and 60s and although there are some scientific details to (legitimately) quibble about, and even squirm over, it is far superior to some of the other movies put out at the time (see Cat Women of the Moon). Even as late as the 1980s, you had George Lucas having the crew of the Millenium Falcon walking on an asteroid wearing only pants and shirts.

Anyway, the plot is straightforward: in an attempt to obtain an unlimited amount of metals from the earth's core, as well as exploit the geothermal energy, a drilling is carried out to the center of the planet, culminating in an atomic explosion in order to break through. A miscalculation takes place and a gigantic fissure is created which travels along a geological fault. The acting is superb all around, Dana Andrews in particular, and the film's mood is accented by its ""heavy"" musical score. When I originally saw it, decades ago, it was a white knuckle experience.

Located in the Tanganyika outback, they have managed to do the impossible: bored a large hole through the Earth's mantle; only a thin, but impregnable layer prevents them from tapping the magma in the Earth's outer core . . . .

If you are Dr. Steven Sorenson you have persuaded the Defense Department to provide you with a nuclear-tipped missile to fire down the hole.  Everything is set to go, but first you need the international commission's approval.  You assure them the risks are minimal.  However, there was one dissenter on your team, and in his absence, you gloss over the concerns of Dr. Rampian . . . .

If you are Dr. Ted Rampian you were ticked off when you got back and discovered that Steven had convened the commission behind your back.  You are old friends, he had been your mentor and professor, but he could be vexing at times with his manipulative ways of getting what he wanted.  The commission must see your data!  As you pack, Mrs. Sorenson stops by; she offers to darn your socks.  You quietly harbor old romantic feelings for her but keep them in check . . . .

If you are Dr. Maggie Sorenson you love Steven dearly, you want to start a family with him, but lately he has been acting so strangely: what's he hiding?

4042757,5,B002ZTNJ2A,"This will not be long. This is not a review of the movie, but of the Blu-Ray release.

For some reason there is very little difference in the pricing of the DVD and the Blu-Ray (BD). In which case, here it is worth the option of going for the BD.

The print is not perfect. But it does appear that it is the same one they used for the DVD release. Fortunately, there is an improvement over the DVD. Not a big one, mind you. But a definite improvement. Everything appears more clearly defined and focused. Even the stock footage that was used for some scenes appeared clearer, though they generally still looked like stock footage. Happily, the appearance of artifacts like film grain were not particularly noticeable like it has been in some BD releases.

I always thought that this movie had great sound effects. For the BD, the audio is still excellent, though the overall level appears to be lower than the DVD. I didn't have to raise the level of my center channel like I have to for some movies. Even though the original audio was mono, this movie delivers plenty of sonic impact. I found the opening to still be quite impressive. This is a movie with big explosions (the world is being torn-apart afterall) and the audio delivers; even in mono.

4042760,3,B002ZTNJ2A,"I haven't seen this film in many years but the new Blu-ray version from Olive films is surprisingly entertaining. Its your basic early 1960s end of the world cautionary tale where messing around with mother earth could destroy the planet. Dana Andrews plays a scientist who plans to exploit the planets subterranean mineral resources by detonating a nuclear bomb miles below the earth. The results of this detonation leads to the films descriptive title and the mad rush to come up with a method to save the planet. The special effects are not bad at all for a low budget 60s film and the dvd transfer is very good with vivid colors which add to the overall sense of heat since the catastrophic scenes involve lots of fire imagery. Besides Andrews, who fantasy film fans will recognize from Jacque Tourneur's classic 1956 film Curse of the Demon(aka Night of the Demon), there is Janette Scott and Kieron Moore who both appeared in The Day of the Triffids a few years earlier. Sci-fi trivia buffs will also recognize Eugene Lourie's name in the opening credits. Lourie directed three of the 1950/early 60s 'dinosaur on the rampage' films, The Giant Behemoth, Gorgo and most importantly The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. Last but not least, the film's ending is quite unique though the science is a little/a lot dubious!

Though I was ecstatic to finally see a clean DVD come out (My pathetic AMC recorded VHS was getting pretty crinkly), I was a bit disappointed to see it not given the treatment it deserves.
The aspect ratio is too tight, maybe correct width, but much loss along the bottom of the picture.  And if any strange, belated journey of an internationally co-produced ode to epic end of the world flicks of the 1950's to the screen should be told... Crack in the World is it!  Sigh...  Maybe?... Hell, no.  Seriously doubt any future definitive edition will happen, given the continued demise of physical media (damn you, digital download streaming, on demand crap!).

So, I guess this will have to suffice. It is better than anything available before and at a fair price.

4042766,5,B002ZTNJ2A,"Crack in the world. It's one of the better SF movies from the 1960's concerning itself with Dr Sorenson's (Dana Andrews) bid to discover a way to tap the geothermal energy of the earth itself as an energy source. Seems, though, that he's reached a point where conventional drilling equipment cannot get through a layer of rock so he seeks to use a thermonuclear device mounted on a rocket to burn through this layer.

Fellow scientist, Dr Rampion (Keiron Moore), disagrees with Sorenson's theory that the device will burn through the layer. He feels that it will shatter the earth's crust with the explosion because of its weakening due to previous atomic undergroud testing -- endangering the very existence of the planet.

The device is fired and initially all goes well. However, soon reports of seismic activity begin to flood in from around the globe. Seems Rampion was right after all. A crack has begun forming under the sea close to the site of the explosion. Undersea earthquakes and volcanic activity begin a sharp upswing. Now the problem is how to stop the earth from spitting in two.

The science for this is streched and has since been revised. However, that does not take away from the film itself. For an hour and a half, we are entertained by some superb acting and interesting special effects. The ending of the movie is unique to say the least and tickles our imagination.

The DVD is crisp and clear visually and has top quality sound. This film has been on my DVD wish list for so long, I'd about given up ever seeing it released (I had an old VHS copy I recorded from television). But here it is, fresh and new.

If you've never seen one of the old ""B"" SF or monster movies, you're in for a treat here. This is a true gem.

Highly Recommended for all ages.

4042767,5,B002ZTNJ2A,"The 60's had some of the best SF movies of all time, true classics.  George Pal's ""The Time Machine"" and ""Atlantis"",  ""Mysterious Island"", ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", ""Mothra"", ""Day of the Triffids"" (OK, that one was not that great), ""Dr. Who and the Daleks"", ""War Gods of the Deep"", ""Fantastic Voyage"" - the list goes on and on. These were the days of practical effects - real explosions, stop-motion, models, matte paintings.  In this mix we had ""Crack in the World"" - an end of the world SF flick - and one that really should be remade for this decade.

Remember - we're talking 1965 - one year before the original Star Trek series. Special effects were double-exposures, creative editing and miniatures. The movie still looks good, even today.  The premise - the world needs clean energy, so it's time to tap the power of Magma (basically geothermal energy) - but something goes terribly wrong - and a crack forms along a known fault line.  The world could be split in half! What to do, what to do?!

OK, you'll find yourself laughing at some of the physics involved.  Scientists set off a nuke in a volcano - and watch from a neighboring island.  No shock wave, wind, tidal effects, radiation - nothing. This type of oversight occurs throughout the movie.

The sets are really great - the details are impressive, and you believe that it's an underground facility. Kind of resembles the missile silo sets from the Stargate series.  The story line still holds up, and we have the typical 1960's stereotypes - manly men, women scream whenever danger is near, and women look like they are wearing nose-cones under their tops.

It's a fun romp and worth watching.",1301011200,,1670,4.662116040955631

4042773,3,B002ZTNJ2A,"WCBS-TV New York owned a print of this movie back in the 1960s and 1970s, and ran it (at least once a month) on The Late Show, The Late Late Show or The Early Show. Occasionally, it was on on a Saturday afternoon when people with a normal circadian rhythm were awake too. In any event, if you stayed awake long enough you were going to catch this 1965 Sci-Fi classic.

Dana Andrews (Dr. Sorenson) had been a serious dramatic actor in his early days, but in the era before celebrity rehab, his alcoholism relegated him to making a slue of ""B"" and ""C"" movies, of which CRACK IN THE WORLD is a premier example. The native-Irish speaking Kieron Moore (Dr. Rampion) and Janette Scott (Maggie) also star.

The premise is inventive, though the science is very weak. Actually, CRACK IN THE WORLD deserves a remake as one of the earliest ""earth apocalypse"" movies in the vein of 2012 and INDEPENDENCE DAY.

The secretly-dying Dr. Sorenson, in an attempt to free us from dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels decides to tap Earth's geothermal energy, and fires a nuclear rocket down into the bowels of the earth to break through the crust.

(The then-theory/now science of Plate Tectonics demonstrates that the crust of the earth is already cracked into a score of giant pieces which support the oceans and continents. The movement of these plates causes earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain -building, and other natural phenomena. Added to this is the fact that any man-made object like a rocket would simply melt once inside the Earth's magma.)

The scientific world is agog at Sorenson, all except Dr. Rampion, who insists that the rocket will not burn through the crust but shatter it, causing worldwide catastrophe. Sorenson dismisses Rampion's concerns, mostly because Rampion is carrying on an open affair with Maggie, Sorenson's wife, and secondarily because Rampion has a foreign accent (Moore's parents founded the Gaelic Language League, and Gaelic was his mother-tongue; but his accent in this film is an odd melange. ""Rampion"" is also an Armenian name, and Armenia was inside the USSR at the time. The question of whether Rampion is an enemy agent is never brought up, but the 1964 production date of CRACK IN THE WORLD places it squarely in the eye of the Cold War hurricane).

The rocket is launched, inverted (this looks odd, for sure, and since it lifts off downward with less drama than a Roman Candle, it's unintentionally funny). Unfortunately, Rampion is right, and the crust shatters, causing a disastrous crack in the world. ""The Rampion Theory is no longer a theory,"" Sorenson intones heavily.

Sorenson decides the only way to divert the crack is to launch another rocket, causing another crack that will relieve pressure on the crust. His thinking is not all its cracked up to be, however, and the two cracks join, carving out an immense portion of the Earth's surface, which then flies into space (never mind gravity), forming another moon (never mind the tidal force of this which would cause the Earth to disintegrate entirely). Sorenson chooses to stay within the danger zone, reporting on the event, which makes him the first man on the new moon.

CRACK IN THE WORLD, with all its flaws, does capture the imagination, and is definitely worth an occasional viewing.",1284940800,4,3284,4.893884892086331
4042774,4,B002ZTNJ2A,"I would rate ""Crack in the World"" a four star film that I am sorry I missed in 1965, when it was first released. What I think I enjoyed, besides the time frame of the movie (mid-60's), was that it was made with many of the production values of early sci-film films made post WWII, and had all the ingredients of good ""cold-war"" science fiction. It also had very good special effects and really pulled off many scenes without looking too shabby. The ""new moon"" created at the ending would never have happened, and would have made one quick trip up and down, or left the earth entirely(and can prove it).",1284854400,,602,4.4324324324324325

The effects work is still good, especially now I've seen it in widescreen even where stock footage is used. The quality of the image from the dvd is very good with clear colour and sound.",1283040000,2,491,4.326086956521739

4042777,5,B002ZTNJ2A,"I know the exact circumstances when I first saw ""Crack in the World."" The date was April 25, 1970. The place was Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. And it was broadcast on a local television show called ""Chiller Theatre,"" hosted by home-towner Bill ""Chilly Billy"" Cardille. Today, more than 40 years later, Chilly Billy is still going strong on the radio in Pittsburgh, although ""Chiller Theatre"" is no more, and ""Crack in the World"" has finally--FINALLY--come out on DVD.

I'm pleased to say it is ALMOST as good as I remember. It lives up to the strong impression it made on me the first and only time I saw it. I vividly recalled some of the scenes even after four decades, especially the one where the team lowers the atomic bomb into the volcano. There's a lot packed into its 96-minute run time, and most of it holds up pretty well, even for today's jaded audiences. There's a terminally ill scientist who wants to finish his life's work of tapping a new source of energy--the magma in the earth's core--before he dies. There's another scientist who fears that the work, if completed, will doom the earth. There's the obligatory romantic triangle among the two scientists and the beautiful (of course) woman they both love. There's a global disaster of epic proportions, and there's mass destruction as the fears of the second scientist come true (that's not a spoiler--if it didn't happen, there would be no story).

It's a little slow in parts, mostly when the three-sided romantic entanglements take center stage, but elsewhere ""Crack in the World"" moves at a furious pace as the scientists race against time to save the earth from the cataclysm they've unleashed. The special effects range from pretty poor (in just a couple of shots) to jaw-droppingly excellent. They're mostly pretty good considering the pre-CGI state of the art in 1965. The story holds together well, the characters are interesting and the production values are great, with crisp, clear scenes in the original semi-widescreen format, vibrant color and a sound track with dialog you can actually understand (an increasingly rare attribute lately).

""Crack in the World"" is a great addition to any DVD library of truly classic science fiction movies. Now if only ""Gog"" and ""The Day the Earth Moved"" would come out on DVD, I'd be a very happy camper...",1280966400,15,2321,4.900763358778626

The dialogue is sharp and logical and the plot builds to a stunning climax that is quite improbable, but awesome none the less. This is a film for adults; the screenplay does not pander to a young audience. I have not seen this film in over thirty-five years and seeing it again is like seeing a long lost friend. ""Crack in the World"" was a staple on American television in the early 1970s, but vanished for some reason mid-decade and has seen limited screen time since. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of extras on the DVD, hence the four stars. This film is deserving of better treatment. Perhaps in the future Paramount will provide us with a adequate special addition.",1280880000,,1014,4.670391061452514
4042779,4,B002ZTNJ2A,"Wow, after wearing out my bootleg VHS cassette, I have a chance at this great, cleaned-up DVD!

A dying scientist, who also has a gorgeous daughter and a few young guys after her (love the subplots in this thing) figures that if he sends a nuclear missile into the bowels of the earth, that he can have a controlled flow of minerals and metals to help Man.

The opposing scientist says that he's nuts and that it would be like taking a hammer and smashing glass (he demonstrates -- Crash!).

Fun science-gone-mad film, with the rush to stop the crack in the world as it migrates slowly across the planet, causing destruction in its wake.  Dana Andrews looks very much like Eddie Albert or Brian Keith as he rolls around in his wheelchair trying to stop the advance.  Old film footage of volcanoes and such are throughout the film.

The ending is interesting too [spoiler] as we witness the birth of a new moon!

There are better end of the world films out there, but this one is a lot of fun to watch!
