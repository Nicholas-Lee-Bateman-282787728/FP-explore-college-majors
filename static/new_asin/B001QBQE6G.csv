8335331,5,B001QBQE6G,I'm a big fan of Haruma Muira's. I really liked this series. I had to keep watching to see what happened next. I hope they come out with a third series of it at some point.,1374364800,,172,3.8055555555555554
8335332,3,B001QBQE6G,I watched this drama online first and loved it. All the reviews i saw said that the subs were good so i bought it The subs are good in the beginning until midway then they are not as good. They start not subbing some sentences and simplifying what there saying and you can tell thats not what they said. The last 3 episodes are the worst subs you have no idea what there saying or whats happening.,1359504000,,397,4.1688311688311686
8335333,5,B001QBQE6G,VERY Happy with purchase. Came two days early and the disks work wonderful. I found no problems with the subtitles(it's not hard to understand) and the story line was simply amazing.,1312761600,,182,4.903225806451613
8335334,2,B001QBQE6G,The series is great. It is exiting and fun to watch. but after two or three episods the texting is relly weard. it is really bad english. but otherwise it's a good product.,1240963200,2,172,4.242424242424242
