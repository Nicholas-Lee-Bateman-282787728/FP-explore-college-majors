8657887,5,B00KDQEA8E,"I have played on and in the Au Sable River for 60+ years...excellent video content and narration, thank you for producing this. I have watched it several times.  This treasured river is deserving of enhanced conservation and preservation in order for future generations to enjoy her as my family and I have. In my opinion the Au Sable River Shed should be declared a national treasure worthy of complete protection from exploitation and this video demonstrates why! My gratitude goes out to the producers...thank you again.",1461196800,,523,5.0813953488372094

8657891,5,B00KDQEA8E,"Beautiful scenery and fishing scenes. Artfully combines fishing sequences with interviews from many of the River's ""old hands"", and also delves into some of the history of the river and efforts to improve it's fishery.  A great DVD for any fisherman.",1419465600,2,250,5.097560975609756

8657894,5,B00KDQEA8E,"I suppose by now i'm a little biased because I have all of RT's dvd's but on this one he has completely raised the bar!!
The dvd is 3 hours in length and includes 3 features that could all stand on their own and all have something to do with the AuSable River...which I think is pretty cool.

The main feature The River is about as good of a documentary as you'll find on any subject. And if your an AuSable fisherman I would
find it hard to believe that you would be disappointed watching this film. This is not a fish porn type film, if that is what you are looking for you will be disappointed, however if your looking to learn a little about the river as told by folks that have a special connection to it...than this is your film, and yes there are fish caught...and some nice ones!

The Brothers Brown is a great piece about three brothers who grew up fishing the lower AuSable and was featured as part of the 2013 Fly Fishing Film Festival. Again, this piece alone could be it's own dvd because the full feature is near 50 minutes.

Summers is a piece about legendary bamboo fly rod maker Bob Summers and his relationship with George Griffith (founder of TU)
It's a pretty cool piece and a little bit of Michigan fly fishing history in it's own right.

I can't say enough about the dvd and I honestly don't think there is anyone out there creating fly fishing content as good as this guy.
The shooting, the editing, the music...it's all fantastic. You will not be disappointed with this dvd even if you've never fished Michigan or the AuSable river.",1405036800,5,1556,4.373702422145329
