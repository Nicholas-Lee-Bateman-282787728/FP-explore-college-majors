8468986,1,B005ESPVIO,"What I'm missing is the bulk of how to record using Sonar X1. For the money the video is way too short. And the author doesn't even record anything ""live"". Isn't that what most people use a DAW for? Maybe it's me and I don't live in a drum machine, techno-synthesized world like this author creating dull dance music. If I could get my money back I would!",1370476800,,355,4.235294117647059
8468987,3,B005ESPVIO,"Though a LONG time Cakewalk user (Cakewalk 4.0, Cakewalk 8.0, Sonar 6.0, Sonar 8.5), I never really got that deep into the product.  I mostly used it for sequencing hardware synths, then added vocals/guitar via a stand-alone multitrack recorder (Korg D16 for many years).  Having broken the soft-wall with Propellerhead Reason, I finally started recording, mixing, playing on the soft side with Sonar 6.0 and one of the NI Komplete packages.  WOW...so much easier to use (especially for editing) than a stand-alone multitrack recorder.  One thing I didn't like about Cakewalk Sonar was they would do a full digit increment release EVERY year, sometimes with less-than-full-digit-increment features.

Well, I reluctantly upgraded to X1, and quickly found myself flustered by the revamped user interface, and I decided to give this video a shot.  I've used (and reviewed) Hal Leonard's ""Music Pro Guides: Reason 5 Advanced Applications"" and some of the complaints I had with that product, I also have with this one.

So, let's tally up the good's, the mediocre's, the bad's and the ugly's.

Good's:
- As a beginner with Sonar X1, and only a mediocre user for Sonar 6 and 8.5, I immediately started learning stuff watching this.  If you don't know much, almost ANYthing will teach you SOMEthing.  In only a few short years (since version 6) Sonar has added LOTS of new plug-ins and stuff to help you compose, record, mix, and burn.  This covered some features I really wasn't up to speed on
- It has some example projects and explanations that Andrew Eisele (the video instructor) works through in real time to help you learn (but this positive is also a negative at times...see bullet #2 under ""mediocre's"")
- Almost 3 hours of content

Mediocre's:
- As the other reviewer pointed out, the examples and projects really have a drumming/rhythm focus.  Understandably the majority of computer based recording enthusiasts are probably working with techno, dub, drum-n-bass, hip-hop or whatever, and this is what THEY want, but the lack of at least SOME real instrument recording examples (acoustic instruments, electric guitars, etc), was a let-down
- Content focus...like in the ""Reason 5"" video I reviewed, also with Andrew Eisele, it isn't the most organized content, and he isn't the most organized presenter.  He sort of meanders at times, making mistakes, helping us LEARN from his mistakes (which isn't bad, but it's not PLANNED) and wasting video time just clicking away to see what happens.  The whole video could have been much more focused, concisely edited, and presented. Sometimes ""real time examples"" are just ""wasting time examples"" when space on the DVD is limited
- Video quality...this is a DVD video which is great because you can play it in any DVD player, but the video resolution isn't good enough for you to see some of the detail in the video of Sonar X1 (can't read the words, labels, etc), unless they zoom in to show you up close.  Which they do occasionally in the video but not enough in my opinion.  After being spoiled with 720 video resolution on quite a few YouTube tutorial videos for Reason and Sonar, this is severely lacking at times

Bad's:
- Utility to Price ratio (compared to all the free stuff on YouTube).  This costs $35 and the sad truth is there are better productions on YouTube (check out MCI Productions video tutorials with Pippin Henderson) that have much better organized presentations, just as good production quality, and better video resolution/clarity.  Well, it's the ""sad truth"" for Hal Leonard, not any of you who opt to watch those instead of buying this

Ugly's:
- Once again Andrew Eisele has modded his hairdo...

In summary, this isn't a bad product, it's just not a good-to-great one either.  If you're new to Sonar X1 and don't mind laying out the cash, you will definitely get something out of this, and it does cover some of the basics better than much of what I've seen on YouTube (going through menu options, what certain buttons do, etc).  BUT...for me, this is my second Andrew-Eisele-presented ""Hal Leonard"" video tutorial, and I suspect it will be my last.  There are just too many other better quality and lower-priced (free on YouTube!) options.",1330905600,,4216,4.937677053824363
8468988,3,B005ESPVIO,"if the instructor had spent some time working with something other than a drum track it could've been better. mind you, i needed that lesson, not being a drummer myself. being a guitar player and vocalist i sure could've used some work there. maybe if they had labeled it ""sonar x1 drum session"" it could've been better.",1327190400,,320,4.631578947368421
