7984844,5,B00008JL6Y,"Turn of the Screw is Britten's tightest and tautest opera, in 16 short scenes that build the tension step by step to the shattering climas.  Based on Henry James's famous (and much discusssed) ghost story, it is performed here with a superb cast that sings splendidly and with the full dramatic character of the piece.  Helen Field (a singer I had not heard previously) is exceptional in tracing the arc of the Governess role from innocent excitement at the job and cheerful caring for the children to the gradual realization that something is very wrong at Bly, to the ultimate catastrophic scene with Miles (and, in the background, Peter Quint).

Some writers and opera goers have complained about Turn of the Screw on account of the actual physical appearance onstage, as singing characters, of the ghosts, Miss Jessel and Quint. They argue that James's story carefully balanced the possibility that the ghosts were ""real"" with the alternate possibility that they were figments of the Governess's imagination. This DVD is a stage production filmed for TV, and it uses some camera tricks to suggest that the ""ghosts"" may not really be physically present, allowing the opera viewer to consider both possibilities.  In any case, the musical layout--with interludes beteen each of the scenes cast as a variation of the theme first heard complete at the end of the proluge, just at the moment that the Governess accepts the job at Bly--allows the story to move quickly from scene to scene with the steady tightening of the situation to the climactic final encounter

Though the production was mounted by a German company, the singers are all native English speakers, and the text is clearly pronounced (optional subtitles are available in several languages). Conductor Steueart Bedford was a close associate of Britten's, conducting many of his late works in their premiere performances; the chamber orchestra (15 instruments, as called for in this chamber opera) are superbly played by members of the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Stuttgart, each of whom is a soloist in this context.

All in all, I find this a superbly performed and presented video version of one of the operatic masterpieces of the 20th century",1447027200,,2211,5.043835616438356
7984845,5,B00008JL6Y,"... in its own right, this opera is sheer perfection. I really got deeply involved with the characters and what happened to them. They all seemed so perfect for their parts and sang superbly well. The atmosphere and tension never let up and, against all expectations, I found it - for a want of better words - a total, extremely satisfying experience.",1364947200,3,351,4.67741935483871
7984846,5,B00008JL6Y,"Benjamin Britten's 1954 opera based on Henry James's spooky ghost story, 'The Turn of the Screw,' is acknowledged as one of his masterpieces. The libretto by Myfanwy Piper is as allusive, poetic  and psychologically powerful as James's original.
This production, from the 1990 Schwetzingen Festival was a co-production of Covent Garden and the Cologne Opera. The British cast includes Helen Field (Governess), Menai Davies (Mrs Grose), Richard Greager (Peter Quint), Phyllis Cannan (Miss Jessel), Machiko Obata (Flora), and Samuel Linay (Miles). The orchestra, conducted by Britten expert (and artistic director of Britten's own Aldeburgh Festival) Steuart Bedford, is the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (well, fifteen players from that group anyhow - Britten's orchestration for chamber orchestra is a miracle of colorful economy). The stage direction, by German Michael Hampe, is suitably eerie, catching the increasing tension ['the turn of the screw'] as the story unfolds. The set and costume design is not credited in the DVD's booklet, but requires mention because the black, gray and white colors that predominate are so apt to the shadowy ambience of the story. Finally, the direction for video and TV by Claus Viller is as effective as it is unobtrusive.
The opera is in a prologue (sung by the tenor who later sings Peter Quint) and two acts comprising eight scenes each. Each scene is preceded by an orchestral interlude - a theme and fifteen variations. It tells of the arrival of a governess at an isolated English country house where her absent employer's niece and nephew and an elderly housekeeper live. She soon learns that the employer's butler and the children's former governess have both died but are now ghosts who haunt the estate, exerting a hidden but powerful and malevolent influence on the two children. The governess, good-hearted but barely more than an innocent herself, determines that she must protect the children and try to rid them of these evil influences. In the end that is accomplished, but only after young Miles has himself died. This simple bare-bones retelling of the story, of course, cannot relate the building terror of the story, nor the widening circles of its allusive text. I leave it to others to speculate about the psychological ramifications of the story; it works as a piece of theater alone without any need for psychologizing, although that can make it seem a richer, deeper work.
Suffice it to say, I found this production to be extraordinarily effective in all departments: the singers are all wonderful, both as musicians and as actors; the direction by Bedford is taut and musical; the playing of the orchestra could not be bettered; the stage direction and visual effects are fairly straightforward (none of the Eurotrashing of the opera that has become so frightfully common in German productions) and dramatically telling. I shall come back to this DVD again and again.
My highest recommendation.
