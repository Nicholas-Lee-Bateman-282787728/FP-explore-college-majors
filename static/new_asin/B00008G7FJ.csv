7982932,1,B00008G7FJ,It seems to be a great movie. But I'm not going to  purchase it. It's too expensive $58. dollars on Amazon. I hope it's a typo. Otherwise I can't afford it.,1523145600,,156,4.032258064516129
7982933,5,B00008G7FJ,"This film is a must see for all young people.  It follows a young Hispanic  immigrant who comes to America  and speaks no English.  Her struggle in her  new country shows her trying so hard to adapt to the new culture, and  to fit in at school , and finally gaining the self esteem and confidence through the help of a sympathetic teacher who realizes that the girl has exceptional talent.
This  film is based on a true story about the girl who grew up to be a famous author.
The movie  has a great cast and won a prestigious Peabody Award.",1392940800,2,540,4.2254901960784315
7982934,5,B00008G7FJ,"I teach Spanish at a local University and showed the movie to students who read the book ""Cuando era puertorriquena"" (When I was Puerto Rican) by Esmeralda Santiago.  The movie is mostly in Spanish with English subtitles.  The storyline follows the end of the novel and part of Santiago's sequel, ""Almost a Woman.""  I feel the acting was excellent and the setting was very interesting and believable.  The movie held the student's interest and gave a good insite on Puerto Rican-Americans.",1272326400,5,489,5.0
7982935,5,B00008G7FJ,Great movie that follows closely Esmeralda Santiago's book.  If you like her books this movie is a must.,1244332800,,104,4.777777777777778
7982936,5,B00008G7FJ,"Weather you're an Esmeralda Santiago fan or not, you've read her biography or not, and you're Puerto Rican or not-  This movie will capture your heart and touch your inner most feelings.  It is brilliantly made- with carefully chosen actors to play the parts, and with beautiful and well chosen images of rural Puerto Rico, including a captivating rhythmic soundtrack of some of our most talented musicians.  Although the movie is based on Puerto Rican Author, Esmeralda Santiago's biography part 2, ""Almost a Woman"", you do not need to be Puerto Rican to be brought back into memory lane and be reminded of your traditions, your culture, and the strong family ties that prevail against all odds.  The movie is short and sweet. You will not be disappointed with it.",1218931200,,765,4.861538461538461

7982938,5,B00008G7FJ,"Ana Maria Lagasca is mesmerizing and compelling, as ""Negi,"" the eldest of ten children, who emigrate from Puerto Rico to New York with their mother.  This TV-film version of Esmeralda Santiago's ""Almost A Woman,"" the sequel to ""When I Was Puerto Rican,"" beautifully encapsulates the essence of the novel.  For starters, Santiago had a first hand part in the production and orchestration of the film version.  She wrote the screenplay, which extracts the most dramatically compelling and engaging scenes from the book.  Secondly, the acting is first class and the actors are nothing short of wonderful.  Wanda De Jesus sparkles, as Negi's strong-willed and resilient mother.  The rest of the cast is of equal first rate calibre.

What I appreciate about this film is, although it focuses on the experiences of a young Puerto Rican girl in a foreign place, who, upon arrival, speaks almost no English, the story isn't exclusive to the Latino experience in the United States.  Her feeling of isolation and exclusion is a universal feeling many people have experienced, at some time or another.  What's more, her story of triumph in the face of adversity, going on to shine at the New York Performing High School For the Arts, as an aspiring actress, is nothing short of inspiring.

This film mixes warmth with the cool reality of assimilation, and manages to remain compelling to, both, a young audience and a more mature one.  I highly reccomend this.",1133654400,7,1449,4.970954356846473
7982939,5,B00008G7FJ,"I first read the book Almost A Woman by Esmeralda Santiago over three years ago and loved it.  So when I received a notice from a friend that Lehman College in the Bronx, NY was showing a viewing of the movie I traveled from Philadelphia to New York to see this film.  I was not disappointed!  Almost a Woman was a wonderful representation of the book.  I recommend that all Latinas between the ages of 10 - 45 see this film.  It's a wonderful story of coming of age, of transcultural life, of the struggles and ultimate triumph of one girl who in the mist of adolescents goes against tradition to demand access to a better way of life and education.  Bravo Esmeralda, you've done it again!",1066003200,17,690,4.393700787401575
