8133294,4,B000GKHM78,"The trailer for Three makes it look like a movie length version of the end scene of John Woo's Hard Boiled, which was already a movie length scene to begin with. Instead, Johnnie To has created a movie more akin to a Olivier Marchal or Jean Pierre Melville film. You get an actual plot that unfolds and gives you a few mysteries to figure out and some twists and turns just for good measure. It's basically made for grown ups instead of kids or tweens looking for a gangster version of superhero movies spit out by Marvel or DC. The best example of  this is To's dedication to color control. The movie doesn't look like a rainbow puked up like so many post Suicide Squad films do for super hero films, which I liked Suicide Squad but it's amazing how most superhero movies made post it have similar color ideas. Instead, the color scheme is carefully controlled to create a consistent mood and heighten tension.

It's not to say it's not without action sequences. The ones that are there are well shot. They also show a lot of interesting digital film techniques. Johnnie To clearly is not slowing down with age any time soon.

The movie has all the typical To quirks. His choice of music is a little jarring but works in the context of  his work. Some plot moments feel cheesy. I don't want to give anything away but there's definitely some goofiness. None of this gets in the way of the movie being good and for that matter it's nice to see a Hong Kong movie that feels like old school Hong Kong.",1497052800,,1498,4.416666666666667

In spite of that it will be part of my ""Asian"" movie collections as I love martial arts, mystery thrillers and history related movies ( ie. Japanese, Chinese or Korean history.)",1496966400,,256,4.565217391304348

8133297,2,B000GKHM78,"if your looking for any action from this Asian flick don't expect it till the last maybe 15 mins of the movie, and even when it gets to the action its not even worth it, dull story, dull characters and dull action. stay away.",1496102400,,225,4.136363636363637

8133300,2,B000GKHM78,"being a fan of JOHNNIE TO'S earlier work, this movie was really a let down!
the shoot-out scene looked as it would've been better in a ""NAKED GUN"" film , and the CGI in this film really
finished killing it for me. HONG KONG cinema and CGI don't mix!! (really bad CGI!! even todays video games look more realistic!!)
i highly recommend movies like ...
VENGEANCE.
EXILED.
BREAKING NEWS.
FULLTIME KILLER.
...just to name a few.
this movie was over hyped by the media.",1493337600,,464,4.535714285714286

8133302,1,B000GKHM78,"Pretentious, slow, low quality movie with no action, hateable main characters, and overall just stupid.",1491004800,,103,5.933333333333334
