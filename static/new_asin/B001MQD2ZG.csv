8321545,3,B001MQD2ZG,"If you've seen Kung Fu Hustle or Shaolin Soccer, this movie falls into the same category. About a Japanese girl that has studied Kung Fu in China and wants to return to Japan to open a dojo and teach Shaolin Kung Fu. However, she ends up playing on a Lacrosse team and teaching the Lacrosse players how to use Kung Fu to enhance their Lacrosse skills. No, that didn't make any sense to me either! Maybe it's a Japanese thing.

It's a comedy with some cute girls, but don't expect much in the way of an interesting story as there was in Kung Fu Hustle, and it's not as entertaining as Shaolin Soccer.",1247443200,2,599,4.300884955752212
