2655457,4,B000ICL3QA,"It looks as if the organizers of the 2006 Salzburg Festival did not want to take risks with a new production of Don Giovanni and chose the one that Martin Kusej directed with great success three years ago with the Vienna Philarmonic Orchestra under Nikolaus Harnoncourt's conduction, and great singers like Thomas Hampson in the title role and Anna Netrebko as Donna Anna. However, given that Harnoncourt and Netrebko were meant to participate in Le Nozze di Figaro, the renowned conductor Daniel Harding and the famous soprano Christine Schafer were chosen to take their places.

Harding is quite familiar with this Opera, having conducted a well known CD recording in 1999 and a DVD recording in 2002, both with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra and Peter Mattei in the title role. In spite of the trouble he found in conducting a larger and heavier orchestra, with tempos which are some times too fast or too slow, the final result is still quite impressive. We can enjoy hearing Thomas Hampson as a suave Don Giovanni and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as a witty Leporello. It must be remarked that given that Hampson is a lyric baritone, his voice is much milder and sweeter than that of a bass baritone like Peter Mattei and Carlos Alvarez. That makes a very special Don who does not seduce women  with a voice that sounds tough and aggressive but subtle and captivating. Hampson's voice can only be compared with other legendary singers like Ruggero Raimondi and Dieter Fischer-Dieskau. D'Arcangelo's basso makes him the perfect companion to Hampson's voice because we can feel the contrast between the refined master and his tough and funny servant .The rest of the cast does a good job: Christine Schafer is a lovely Donna Anna, Piotr Beczala, who replaces Chrsitoph Strehl in the 2003 cast, is a nice Don Ottavio, and the same can be said about Luca Pisaroni as Leporello and Isabel Bayrakdarian as Zerlina. The lowest point is Melanie Diener, who was not able to repeat her wonderful performance of Donna Elvira in 2003.

The hardest critics go to the staging, which does not seem to be the most appropriate for what most people consider the best of Mozart's operas. The scenario looks like a Victoria Secret's store with women in sunglasses and underclothes moving around the main characters. It is not that I do not approve modern productions, but this one does not seem to work well.",1181779200,13,2385,4.855036855036855
2655458,3,B000ICL3QA,"I hate to be critical of a singer whose great voice has brought me so much pleasure, but I expected much more from Thomas Hampson as Don Giovanni. After all, Hampson is known for being a bit of a ham onstage; I thought he'd channel that tendency into a memorable interpretation of the title character. But he doesn't seem to have a handle on the role, even though Giovanni can be validly interpreted any number of ways, from suave seducer to chilling psychopath. Hampson is far too casual onstage and even looks distracted at times. Yes, the voice is fine, but when he's not singing, he has very little stage presence. Ildebrando D'Ancangelo as Leporello is so much more energetic and alive onstage that it makes their many scenes together feel out of balance. In fact, D'Ancangelo's deep and expressive baritone (really a bass-baritone) made me want to see him in the title role instead of Hampson. (D'Ancangelo also plays Leporello in a 1999 DVD from the Vienna Opera.) Hampson excels in the Verdi roles I've seen him in on DVD (as the title role in ""Macbeth"" and as Rodrigue in ""Don Carlos"" to name two); perhaps Mozart is just not for him.

I've seen Christine Schafer do impressive work on DVD (e.g., as Gilda in a recent Covent Garden ""Rigoletto""). Here, she starts out strong as Donna Anna. A few minutes into Act I, she and Don Ottavio (Piotr Beczala) give a chilling rendition of the duet that follows her father's murder (""Fuggi, crudele, fuggi""). They do a tremendous job of highlighting the jarring, dissonant sound that Mozart gave this piece. My expectations were high. But then in Donna Anna's Act I aria (after she recognizes Giovanni as her father's murderer), Schafer struggles, hitting several sour notes. In Act II, she sounds labored in the difficult but exquisite ""Non mi dir."" Beczala fares better as Don Ottavio. He gives a moving rendition of ""Dalla sua pace,"" straight from the heart; and his ""Il mio tesoro"" is the highlight of Act II, as he navigates its many runs and sustained notes with great skill.

Melanie Diener as Donna Elvira is disappointing. In her first aria, she adds a lot of coloratura to Mozart's score, but then fails to hit several notes that he wrote out. This tendency continues throughout her performance. To me, Donna Elvira is the heart of the opera. Many play her as a madwoman, making her almost a buffa character which provides some comic relief in the opera. But that interpretation falls short to me because it's Elvira who steps in and, with the wild and short aria, ""Ah, fuggi il traditor,"" stops Giovanni from seducing Zerlina. Then again, it is Elvira who, in the great quartet with Don Giovanni, Donna Anna, and Don Ottavio, so rattles Giovanni that he gets too close to Donna Anna, allowing her to see that it's he who seduced her in the dark. And it's Donna Elvira who, right until the end, is ready to forgive this doomed man. In addition to her vocal difficulties, Diener just doesn't develop a character (however one thinks Elvira should be interpreted).

As Zerlina, Isabel Bayrakdarian struggles vocally too. I find her voice to be harsh and sometimes shrill, not at all suited for the charming and flirtatious arias Mozart wrote for her character. By contrast, Luca Pisaroni as Masetto does a fine job; I love his deep baritone voice.

Robert Lloyd is in fine bass voice as the Commendatore, but his final confrontation with Giovanni is strange indeed. It lacks the tension and horror that this scene should have. And I object to the rewriting of the Mozart/Da Ponte version of how Giovanni meets his death. (I won't give it away.)

The modern setting of this production doesn't make much sense to me. I know the director is trying to make a point with all the women in bras and panties, but I don't know what it is (perhaps that we're too influenced by ads for underwear - maybe it's a European thing).

The bottom line for me is that it's a disappointing ""Don Giovanni"" when the best performers are those cast as Leporello, Don Ottavio, and Masetto (but kudos to those three - a star for each). With over 50 years of this great opera available on DVD (e.g., Cesare Siepi's classic portrayal of Giovanni at this same Festival in 1954), I can't recommend this one unless you're a ""Don Giovanni"" collector.",1175040000,23,4274,4.6995994659546065
2655459,3,B000ICL3QA,"This Don Giovanni, staged at Salzburg in 2006 created alot of hype, not least because of Thomas Hampson singing the title role.

The production, a very much modernized one, focuses on sex in the media and its effect on us. A typical modern approach to a classic opera. However, although this is an interesting take, it never takes you to a level where you are totally engrossed.

Hampsons singing is fine, although he doesn't sound at all like the Hampson we are used to hearing on record (his voice sounds tired and not completely suited to Mozart). The rest of the cast are fine but with no real stand out other than the commmendatore sung by Robert Llyod. He is a true bass, and unlike alot of the 'bass-baritones'who have taken the role, you thoroughly believe his ghostly pressence when his voice rings with that typical English warmth.

I recommend this DVD to all those collectors, but if you haven't got a DVD of Don Giovanni, I would suggest the traditional version from the met with Terfel and Fleming (although the singing isn't fantastic Zefferelli's direction is inspired and appropriately theatrical). I am a collector, particularly of Don Giovanni's (over 25 complete recordings and 10 DVD's) but I am yet to find a modern production that really seems to work.",1173657600,13,1275,4.786363636363636

8145123,5,B000ICL3QA,"My first encounter with this version, early in my journey into Don Giovanni, left me unimpressed: I found it too analytical, too cool, lacking in the red-hot erotic energy that glows in the core of the opera. A dozen or so Don Giovannis later, I realize I have returned to this take many times and liked it more each time. It is, I now contend, one of the strongest versions on DVD, and this especially thanks to Martin Kusejs stage direction. Overtly political and densely packed, but also courageously fresh, it conveys both the beauty and the terror of the music. Kusej accentuates the human cost of objectification. Donna Anna in that skimpy dress, her vulnerability harshly exposed against the sterile white wallsit feels cold because it is cold! Don Giovanni is centrally about the use of human beings as objects of consumption, and this version unfolds the process in its slick icy violence.",1474848000,,898,4.837662337662338

8145125,5,B000ICL3QA,"The Don Giovanni Salzburg 2014 DVD in order of excellence: The first quality you listen for is vocal quality. The performers are all excellent, beginning to end, just absolutely solid vocal achievement, every single one of them. If for some reason you only listened to a performance, this would be the one you picked. Thankfully you don't have to limit yourself to just listening; you can watch as well. I don't know who the performers rehearse with and practice with but wow. Maestro Eschenbach and the Vienna Philharmonic--what else do you need to know? They excel. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo, handsome, perfect bass. The set is brilliant. The stairs form the perfect symbol, the triangle, given Don Giovanni forms love triangles with the women characters. During the opening scene, Don Giovanni (Ildebrando D'Arcangelo) chases Donna Anna (Lenneke Ruiten) around the triangular staircase and balcony in the same way Mozart's score chases up and down the musical treble and base clef.

Sven-Eric Bechtolf excels with stage direction. His concept is to have the performers act the libretto; they are not just singing and turning to the left and right  People in the United States look to Europeans for use of color, style, and design. The setting is a rich, deep rose (or cherry?). Black and white look fantastic against the background; for example, Donna Elvira (Anett Fritsch) comes looking for Don Giovanni wearing a bedraggled wedding gown, ripped sleeve, muddy hem a very witty and ironic costume choice. The used, muddied wedding dress is the character Donna Elvira. In addition, it's visually interesting that Mr. D'Arcangelo and Ms. Ruiten wear rose or magenta in a couple of the scenes, low contrast to the background but effective and beautiful. Herr Bechtolf creates an original, insightful answer to the question: at the end of Act I, how does Don Giovanni escape from two people holding weapons pointed at him? Finally, music sometimes provides happy coincidences: in the opening scene, the Commendatore (Tomasz Konieczny) throws his sword scabbard on the floor when he challenges Don Giovanni. The sword scabbard clangs in perfect key with the music; a detail that makes this production seem flawless.  You can imagine Mozart and Da Ponte approve of the vocals in the Salzburg 2014 production, Haus fur Mozart. Buy or download, the production should be definitive for the next decade.

The DVD provides 2 complete operas: the traditional view the audience sees; the Behind the Scenes view that an audience almost never sees. The contrasts show how professional and on-point everyone is behind the scenes, as you probably expect. There are also brief moments where you see the performers and crew enjoying, reacting to, and quietly singing along to Mozart and Da Ponte's score and libretto.",1440460800,8,2799,5.145054945054945
8145126,5,B000ICL3QA,"Of all the artists who perform, my thought is Ildebrando D'Arcangelo appeared in two productions during Salzburg 2006, this one and Le Nozze di Figaro, certainly double duty. Thomas Hampson is great. The set, white and contemporary--I change attitudes almost as many times as the stage revolves. Sometimes white seems too plain for Mozart's score. Other times, when the set opens to provide more depth, the set looks somewhat better. I support contemporary staging but I've seen better sets that are white, by coincidence, the white set of Le Nozze from Salzburg 2006. Writing as someone in the United States, I realize that a person needs to watch the Salzburg Fest every year to get the context of performances.",1428278400,,713,5.0
8145127,5,B000ICL3QA,"More than five years ago, I started to commit to review the 19 volumes of this ""M22"" Mozart Salzburg collection, but following the very disappointing ""Oca del Cairo/Sposo deluso"" and, more essentially ""Nozze di Figaro"" entries, I lost the will to do it, which is a shame in hindsight considering the ambition and the cost of this project, which deserved to be fully assessed - since even the operas in fragment forms were recorded. There were also a lot of volumes to be commended in this effort.

What drove me to continue these reviews was the fact that two other publishers have decided to honor the bicentennary of two other major opera composers: Wagner (through the complete opera cycle conducted by Marek Janowski for the Pentatone CD label); and Verdi (through the BluRay cycle of all the Verdi opera performed by the Teatro Regia di Parma).

Since the M22 cycle was pretty much comprised of new recordings taped for the occasion, I thought I'd finish what I had started for Mozart's 250th anniversary - considering that I have begun to review the Wagners on Amazon.co.uk and that I'll start with the Verdis as soon as they start being published.

This Don Giovanni is simply amazing and in my humble opinion, one of the best ones in DVD. A lot has to do with Martin Kusej's production. To be sure it is very modern, very European, and a lot of you will think very Regietheater and therefore very eurotrash. However, versus what Claus Guth did with ""Nozze"", Kusej always ALWAYS moves with the music and does not put his production in the way of the musical movement - at this point one can think whatever he/she wants of the production but it moves, it entertains and it challenges. The basics are very simple: one single moving round stage, rolling like a merry-go-round in a very austere, very dry, very white environment, pretty sterile and bland - except for the blood of the Commandatore in Act I, like a blur of guilt in this very hospital-like copybook.

Kusej takes Don Giovanni as a metaphor for the psyche of the male gender and let me tell you, it is not pleasant. There is obsession with sex, debauchery, womanizing but clearly with the one and only target of getting laid and experiencing pleasure with no sense of collateral damage. The production is in my view very strong at making the audience realise the chain reaction provoked by sex based on misunderstanding, and how compounding cheats and lies can get someone lower and lower. This obsession with sexual indulgence leads to more and more kinky experiences - some of them probably even non-consensual, as demonstrated by the obvious violence some of the woman in the opera seem to be the casualty of (Zerlina in particular).

The production is at its most successful as an illustration of Don Giovanni's very disturbed psyche (I am thinking of the catalogue aria, the permanent presence of women of any shape, any guise, any kind - always considered as pleasure objects and nothing else) and I don't know of any producer who had the courage to dig that deep into the morbidity and danger of Don Giovanni. I would even go as far as to say that this production is not unlike a morality play since it warns us males of a danger of excessive pleasure-seeking and the consequences attached to it, not to mention the tragic deathwish almost willingly anticipated by the Don, following his canzonetta - finishing in pitch dark - as if all this effort to ""get the woman"" made, finally, no sense at all.

Luckily, the cast matches this concept marvelously. Thomas Hampson remains a very physical, very aristocratic and very dark Don Giovanni, and the voice remains beautiful - some added burnish brings a bit more sensuality, if at all possible. D'Arcangelo was pretty much the only saving grace of Harnoncourt's Figaro and his Leporello is unparalleled in musicality and dramatic presence: just great. The revelation of the evening was the magnificent Don Ottavio of Piotr Beczala: his two arias show command, lyricism and class - and I though Ottavio was boring. The same goes for Luca Pisaroni, a fantastic Masetto. Robert Lloyd, as the godfather of Bass singers, makes for an impressive Commandatore.

Among the ladies, Isabel Bayrakdarian is a revelation as Zerlina: loud, accurate, agile - she is also a revelation. Melanie Diener sings a deep and magnificent Elvira - her voice reflecting perfectly the treason and also this absolute certainty that she can save the Don. The only disappointment is the Donna Anna of Christine Schaeffer. She never was, isn't and never will be a Donna Anna. The instrument is too constricted and it is a bit too close to breaking point. Harding has to take all sorts of precautions for her to go through ""non mi dir"" unscathed.

Daniel Harding is a change from Nikolaus Harnoncourt, ""the man with the dead tempi"", and he restores Don Giovanni to its epic qualities, its lyricism and, essentially, its drama. He is not re-inventing the wheel but he is very musical and shows amazing support for his cast.

Overall, this is a brilliant Don Giovanni with a brilliant cast and a production that will make you think, and which I know I will revisit times and times again. Highly recommended.",1349395200,4,5196,4.790178571428571
8145128,4,B000ICL3QA,"Classic staging of this dramatic favorite places it within the period and cast a Casanova-like spell over the narrative. Martin Kusej's Don Giovanni from the 2006 Salzburg festival is far removed from that era. Indeed, at first glance, the feeling is one of having stumbled upon a setting out of a Stanley Kubrick movie. Mobile white walls evoke a glacial, apocalyptic vacuum.

Kusej is not in sympathy with Giovanni, and he hammers that point with all the subtlety of a finale in hell. The duel between the Commendatore and Giovanni is an assassination of an unarmed man. The Commendatore's blood on the diaphanous white wall returns again and again and again. Giovanni is a product of crass, contemporary superficiality. Don Giovanni has been a staple role for baritone Thomas Hampson for nearly thirty years. Hampson's voice is certainly a tad more tattered now than it was in his youth, but this serves the still handsome actor quite well here, giving his Don an appropriate weariness. Hampson is known for his acting skills and his total conviction in this conception of Giovanni is a captivating high point amidst mixed results. Giovanni, as interpreted by Kusej and Hampson, is an existential figure, self-serving, and devouring others to enhance his own masturbatory pleasures. The sterility of that point might be seen in Giovanni's ""Deh vieni."" In the libretto, Giovanni serenades Elvira's maid at the window with a mandolin, but here, it is a solitary experience with Giovanni singing it alone, to no one, as the stage gradually blackens. It's a hauntingly subdued and memorable moment.

Commercial 21st century preoccupation with self-gratification and hollow sexuality is a not-so-subtle symbolic point, manifested by multiple appearances of nebulous, underwear clad glamour models (Kusej refers to them as Greek fertility goddesses). They strike ludicrous poses, arduously scrub floors and mechanically apply their lipstick with disturbing results. They reappear as flabby, old Wagnerian vamps (one step removed from joining George Romero's dead), and finally, revived and young again as monotonous dominatrices. Surprisingly, some critics felt it necessary to point out that the parading of the models was not erotic in the least. (Other critics compared it to the famous Robert Palmer video). The lack of eroticism seems to be an excruciatingly obvious intent.

At other points, characters periodically blindfold themselves, and each other, applying symbolic layer after symbolic layer after symbolic layer.

The interaction between Leporello and Giovanni at the imagined fantasy dinner is genuinely surprising and charming (earlier, their characters exchange recitatives). The Commendatore appears on an Orwellian screen in Hell as an arctic wasteland. Giovanni's descent is a gradual, stone-cold hardening of the arteries. Giovanni's life has been a masturbatory one (rape and murder being characteristics of that self-gratification) and this is equated with a finale of spiritual bankruptcy. On his path to damnation, his servant, Leporello, finally dispatches Giovanni.

These are all substantial, interpretive points that heighten the composer's contradictory, conflicting personality traits (the composer of Giovanni and Cosi fan tutte is also the composer of the ""Great Mass in C minor"").

Christine Schafer is quite good as Donna Anna, capturing the impetuous charisma of the heroine. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is not as vocally suited to Leporello as he was to his unique, Mediterranean Figaro. Isabel Bayrakdarian's buxom Zerlina , adorned in a tight, golden slip, is not only a scratched up, bruised victim to the Don, but, at one point she is even carried away by his army of listless mannequins. Later, as she comforts her wounded lover Masetto (Luca Pisaroni) she very clearly discovers that the way to comfort him lies between his legs. Malanie Diener as Donna Elvira is a considerable disappointment, both in her acting and singing.

Unfortunately, Daniel Harding's flaccid conducting of the Vienna Philharmonic even more seriously mars this production. Harding's direction falls far short of the insight needed for such a conceptual-minded production. Harding is clearly no Carlo Maria Giulini when it comes to his handling of Mozart's sensationally expressive language.

Ultimately, this Giovanni belongs to Hampson and Kusej.

8145129,3,B000ICL3QA,"Other more learned reviewers have detailed strengths and weaknesses in the singers and the nature of the production. I did choose to watch the Mozart 22 at this time since I wanted to see what a ""today"" take would be after seeing a more traditional version. Modern dress did not bother me, modern nearly undress did not bother me. I expected the kind of scenic design that appeared and could go along with it although it seemed to detract rather than aid the production creating too much of a hard, bright atmosphere for the action that was to take place. On the whole the scenic features seem to have a life of their own, generally unrelated to the singing and stage performance going on at the same time. Worst of all, completely unrelated to whether the staging was modern, traditional or totally idiosyncratic and abstract, having no reference to any period, was the occasional but significant violation of a fundamental theatrical rule presumably old in the time of Aristophanes: do not upstage the primary action. What I mean is most visible and painful in the unfailingly successful catalogue song of Leporello. While he was doing a pretty good job at making his accounting of the Don's exploits, hordes of young women cluttered up the stage behind him doing nothing at all significant save busy work in such manner as to distract the hardiest opera buff from the singer.  Of course, it helped not at all that one of them seemed to be bare breasted and otherwise costumed in less than the bra and panties of the others. While one cannot trust the applause meter to judge an opera audiences responses, in this case, the tepid response was right on target...not as a criticism of the singer but as a comment on the interference with his heroic attempt to retain their attention in the face of the competition of his supposedly supporting players. While other instances are not as blatant in their impact, there did frequently occur an almost knowing design to minimize the focus on the singer because one thought they were not capable of keeping it on themselves through their performance. (Any good choreographer, for example, learns to make any klutzy ""great"" star look like a Nureyev by arranging for the supporting dancers to perform miracles of Terpsichore while the Star does one-two-three, one-two-three....
At any rate, if you want to see one version of Don Giovanni as it can be done, you might be interested in this disc, the singers mostly sound good most of the time to the ears of a lay listener; however, if you want to see why Don Giovanni ranks among the most performed operas, I would commend another version.",1252368000,9,2631,4.769736842105263
8145130,2,B000ICL3QA,"As someone who regularly defends the merits of Regietheater, there are a few limits that perhaps are worth upholding, in the interest of defending music.  However clever Martin Kusej's ideas - a few of them indeed are, but not many - he finds himself only halfway unwittingly in an unenviable position, as regards Mozart's Don Giovanni here.

Much of the M22 series is presumably Mozart for the 21st century.  After watching this Don Giovanni, perhaps equally bad this way the Cosi, it does not provide any good reason for living in the still new century at all. It looks like it even suggests one without Mozart.  Yes, the notes are by Mozart, and the words he set to music, but little else remains, anymore than anyone can see as food for Leporello and Don Giovanni to eat in the final scene, except for snow on the stage floor (`snowing' idea borrowed from the underrated Marthe Keller production at the Met?).  Having Nikolaus Harnoncourt conduct this production, as at its premiere, instead of Daniel Harding, could have been more interesting; it could have also meant some clash with the production. The likes of Harnoncourt and Dohnanyi show up alongside Kusej's name on dvd.  That, in reviewing this box for now, will have to remain a mystery.

In Harding, Kusej has found a near-perfect accompanist.  For sake of Mozart's music, the forms therein, expression, note values at times, what shaping any number of phrases mean other than out of some clich&eacute;d vernacular that has nothing to do with Mozart, what ever arrives here seems to have done so half the time by a roll of the dice.  The truncated sonata form of the quartet in Act One can not be heard at all, orchestra playing and pit-stage coordination is so sloppy.  The manner of clipping note values to sound `period' winds up being effete, and even at times sounds cheaply feminized or vernacularized.  Matters improve during Act Two, but even there there are unwelcome reminders of what has happened in Act One.  Limp phrasing, rushing into ""In quale eccessi"", without any urgency of going anywhere specific by doing so, rushing Christine Schafer off a big appoggiatura right before `Non mi dir."", and others.  The best one ever gets out of Harding and the VPO is standard routine.

The most interesting members of this cast are Thomas Hampson (Don Giovanni) and Melanie Diener (Donna Elvira).  Diener, though looking glib more than half the time, seems to have about the most independence from the staging conceits and even meaningless musical conceits of this production.  She wins a little more sympathy for her character than just about anyone else in this cast, and sings lyrically, reasonably well, though early on with issues concerning the break or passaggio, and a little of an unsupported top.  Her peck on the cheek of Hampson at the end of ""Ah fuggi"",a heavily clipped one at that, thanks to Harding, is merely silly.

Thomas Hampson is as rogue a Don Giovanni as one will find, and his characterization remains quite intact from having sung it so many other times and in other setting than this.  There are no surprises here.  He is best when singing lyrically, of course, but tends to hector or shout a few more aggressive passages, with variable effectiveness.  There is little clarity in this production as to his relationship with Leporello and even as to how he is different from most other men in the world about him or at least in this group, meant to represent all the rest.  A bit unusually dry sounding Masetto of Luca Pisaroni and aging Robert Lloyd as the Commendatore, who becomes holograph or webcam of himself during the graveyard scene, make for sensible enough casting too of these two parts. An almost still (fully) lyrical Piotr Beczala (Don Ottavio) and Isabel Bayrakdarian (Zerlina), starting to get roughened up by Ottavio (why?) during ""Il mio tesoro,"" do too, but there are problems.  Beczala tends to sing a bit forced and relentlessly loud at times, according to what I had assumed was his standard, and even looks confused, uncomfortable with what is expected of him here - quite understandably so.

Bayrakdarian, a very charming Susanna on a number of the world's stages and I am sure Zerlina too, looks like something that has wandered in from a mean Puerto Rican barrio in Manhattan.  Instead of it being evident that she is being manhandled by Don Giovanni, she is being carried around on the shoulders of Prosperpina's sisters (new characters in Don Giovanni, all wearing maiden-form bras and undies only, and with no music to sing) toward end of Act One.  She leads the Don on in sluttish manner on during ""La ci darem"" a little more than usually is the case.  Though the singing is charming, especially with ""Vedrai carino"", during which she looks equally beat up and bruised as the Masetto, the charm is all gone (though that is the intent).

Ildebrando d'Arcangelo is the highly wimpy, pouty, boring, vocally very mediocre Leporello.  He tends to resort to barking instead of singing some of his lines, heavily clips a very important entrance during the finale to Act One, toward really changing the music entirely for a moment - not that any of that matters here - and offers tremulous (even guttural) singing at times, seldom ever close to very true to center of pitch.  For those readers pejorative of Thomas Hampson,

Christine Schafer (Donna Anna) is the ideal female Thomas Hampson, with a very tubular type of and awkwardly at best negotiated vocal production (such as found from Hampson at the Met recently as Athanael), is visually unsightly in hand-me-downs, and after tentatively achieved opening scenes, becomes vocally increasingly insecure as the evening progresses.  She is loudly cheered and bravoed anyway, more than Diener, at curtain call. Her leadership of ensemble in both sextets in Act Two, including Epilogue, is audibly a trial, and her slide over an entire scale of pitches during the Masks Trio in Act One is inexplicably vulgar. If there is any reason I really regret watching this dvd, Schafer, a spectacular Lulu at the Met not long before, is it.  One would not sensibly cast Cathy Berberian or Teresa Stratas as Donna Anna either, but Stratas  would have still sung it better than this.

Cast of six remaining singers cheerlessly group around for Epilogue, as in a world still dominated by men, including the Leporello (who has just stabbed his master to death, (out of motive of euthanasia?), who of course are all predators.  Witness Proserpina's sisters all clutching themselves in pain the moment Masetto gives Zerlina a really hard slap right before ""Batti, batti.""  Does not Kusej, in putting out Don Giovanni as a treatise on sexism, have more imaginative solutions than found here?  If not, he is not qualified to stage this opera. He indeed probably has more imagination, but in the context of a festival for wealthy patrons to show off their taste for innovation or radical chic to each other (Salzburg as another brothel of the arts, like Aspen on this side of the pond), it is too easy to get lazy.  Nothing here, including the set design, other than perhaps getting the cyclodome to rotate correctly, seems to require a whole lot of effort.  Kusej'z treatise, if one exists, on evidence of this relies on cheap, pop psychology clich&eacute;s.

With still face of Lloyd on rear screen, twenty babes bulging out of bras and undies from back and looking prematurely aging the other way, standing still, glaring during ""O statua gentilissima"" is the most risible moment of all, but so off-putting, the purpose of this important scene is lost. There is nothing to cheer about here.  Hold on to your money.",1230768000,6,7667,4.861644888547271

bastardize the intentions of the composer and the librettest! No matter!

and vocally flawless.  Kudos also to Melanie Diener as Donna Anna and to
Luca Pisaroni who turns the character part of Masetto into something deep.",1186012800,6,649,4.6347826086956525
