8454450,2,B00002EIZC,"As a beginner, I found this instructional video to be too vague. Ms. Glass obviously has a lot of art training so her projects look nice when finished. However, she mentions cutting the paint with thinner, but gives no guidelines. And ""tinting a glaze"" whatever that entails. She gives no tips on picking a color scheme which is something most newbies need help with. Techniques are a little out of date. What she does with rags and sponges can now be done with special rollers. I also found the resolution of the images poor and had difficulty seeing a finished pattern well. Some guidance on where to find the products she used would have been nice. Overall, this was not a very helpful video. Sorry.",981936000,16,702,4.624
