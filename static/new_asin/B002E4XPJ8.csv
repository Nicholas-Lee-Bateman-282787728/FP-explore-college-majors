8366813,2,B002E4XPJ8,"The story revolves around four guys (Shreyas Talpade, Javed Jaffery, Aashish Choudhary, Vatsal Seth).The chemistry between the guys is something to watch out for. It seems like the scenes between them have been shot without any retakes. There is a scene when all of them are drunk and cursing Asrani and he is standing right behind them, which is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Shreyas and Javed are natural actors and occupy more screen time than the other two.

The other characters in the movie give a decent performance too. Chunky Pandey plays a stuttering goon, Johnny Lever as his sardar brother and Dilnaz as Jhonny's gujarati wife. Dilnaz's dialogues have been nicely written and superbly delivered.",1300838400,,718,4.983333333333333
