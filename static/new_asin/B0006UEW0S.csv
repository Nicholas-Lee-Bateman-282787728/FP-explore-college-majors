2196357,1,B0006UEW0S,"I rented this only to see Misty Mundae run around and get naked and do cute Misty Mundae things. I got a boring viciously awful, miserable acting. And cut up watered down sex scenes, (though I think I saw the R version, check the running time for the unrated if it shows more lesbo nipple sucking). WARNING NO NAKED MISTY HERE!

2196358,2,B0006UEW0S,"I was eager to experience the Misty Mundae cinema, but was shocked when this movie that barely made sense just ended. There was a promise of Part 2, but there wasn't enough running time to make this a whole film.  And there just wasn't enough of Misty in the film. This is not a good place to start if you want to expore Misty's talent.",1128643200,7,336,4.1692307692307695
2196359,4,B0006UEW0S,"Beware Misty fans. Though she is on the cover, Misty is not in this movie that much. The movie is dominated by a really hot pair of British blond chicks. One is a bad guy, the other is a cave woman.

We also get an interesting little side story of a gay relationship between a science researcher and a Yetti (Aboninable (sp) Snowman). Not much plot here. Evil scientists are trying to unlock the secrets of an ancient caveman tribe that holds the secrets to sexual fullfillment.

Lots of sexy scenes as can be expected, and Misty is involved in a short scene with the cavewoman.

This flick is much better than Screaming Dead, but then again every movie is.

Hey it's a Misty Mundae flick. You get what you're expecting with this one. Bad lines, nudity, and lesbianism.",1113436800,30,769,4.510791366906475

2196373,1,B0006UEW0S,dumb movie...ranks crappy amongst crappiest of movies.  do not recommend even if nothing else to watch.  did not finish this.,1401926400,,125,5.2
2196374,1,B0006UEW0S,"This film comes in two versions, the 70 minute and the 77 (unrated) version.  I don't know how they could make a 120 minute version here.

I bought the Director's Cut (no run-time listed) which was a big mistake!  Usually the Director's Cut is longer and more complete.  this one wasn't!

Let's face it, we buy these films for naked girls and to watch Misty have (simulated) sex with other girls.
The Director's Cut was made by a male homosexual or a religious prude because he had cut ALL the sex scenes and most of the nudity from the film.  Yes, you get brief boob-shots but none of Misty.  And just as the girls are about to even kiss, the scene  changes and you get nothing!  He seemed to have an aversion to female nudity or sex.  Maybe he was terrified while being weaned as a baby?

Misty plays a detective or agent, it isn't made clear in this version, and the Director must like fat-jokes as he spends a LOT of time filming the cop eating and dripping food down his padded belly and showing said cop getting stuck in doorways.
Misty enters a couple scenes, has a couple lines of dialogue and vanishes until she needs to enter a room holding a handgun which she swings around in  comedic parody of every cop show ever made.  And the one time she is close to another girl, the clothes stay on and there is a another 'cut' even before they kiss.  What a disappointment.

Yes, the film had a few funny spots, but really, do we watch Misty for those?  No!

I will try another version in the hopes of seeing Misty in her trademark g-on-g, but frankly, save your money and avoid the Director's Cut version.
Unless, of course, naked women terrify you and you like watching bean-burgers drip down a fat-man's shirt.",1395705600,,1716,4.396825396825397
