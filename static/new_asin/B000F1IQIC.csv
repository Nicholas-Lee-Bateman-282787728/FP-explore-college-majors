8116325,5,B000F1IQIC,WONDERFUL SERIES WITH LORENZO LAMAS. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WASN'T PICKED UP FOR A THIRD SEASON. BEAUTIFULLY PHOTOGRPAHED. GREAT STORIES. WONDERFUL ACTING. I LOVE EACH EPISODE. VERY WORTHWHILE.,1501027200,,190,5.586206896551724
8116326,5,B000F1IQIC,"Well, I am a bit partial, My brother in law is Dr. Ramos in Heartbreak Hotel.  What's not to like??
But, I have always loved Lorenzo Lamas in everything I have ever seen him in.",1484611200,,177,4.057142857142857

8116328,5,B000F1IQIC,"Having read negative reviews for this series, I want to disagree with those reviewers and give this series the recognition that it deserves!
First of all, this series is similar in style to many of the excellent action series of the 80's. For example: MacGyver, The Fall Guy, Riptide, Simon & Simon, The A-Team, etc. If you enjoyed those series, you'll likely enjoy this one!
The series achieves what it sets out to do...ENTERTAIN the audience! If you're watching an action adventure series, you want to see action and fighting and explosions...and beautiful women...gorgeous scenery, etc....and this series gives you all of those things!
The plots may not be particularly engulfing and THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE...because this is an ACTION ADVENTURE SERIES!
I have seen worse acting...worse effects...worse plots...and overall WORSE television shows than this one!
This series should have lasted FAR beyond only one season in syndication!
'Air America' is from the same creator as 'Simon & Simon,' and it holds it's own as an excellent acton adventure TV series!
Highly recommended!",1438560000,,1079,5.206896551724138
8116329,5,B000F1IQIC,"Good quality, fast delivery. the only negative thing is, that the episodes are not chronological at the 6 dvds (episode 1 and 2 are on dvd 5 and so on). And the dvds were loose delivered and not in a plastic cover. but everything else is ok.",1434499200,,241,4.148936170212766
8116330,5,B000F1IQIC,This is a wonderful series and Lorenzo Lamas is excellent at Rio Arnett.  It is to bad that this show did not continue because there were so many stories that could have been told but they cancelled it before they could go on with the story. If you are a fan of Lorenzo Lamas then this is the series for you.  The fact that he really is a pilot himself and flies medical supplies in to third world countries is a plus.,1363219200,,418,4.085365853658536
8116331,5,B000F1IQIC,"I am a huge Lorenzo Lamas fan, and while this is not on the scale of Renegade I very much enjoyed it and have watched the series several times over.

Rio and Wiley are great working together.  ANd it was nice to see Lamas in something other than Renegade.  Highly recommend for a pretty good action series.  My only complaint on the series is that the last disc contains the ""Operation Jaguar"" pilots, which I dind't realize until after I'd watched the rest of the series, so I'd say start with the last disc first to get the background THEN go to disc 1.",1323129600,,555,4.3076923076923075
8116332,2,B000F1IQIC,I want to get my pilots license so thought this would be a good purchase but these series are just so unrealistic and fake and boring. I loved the movie though,1315785600,,159,4.161290322580645
8116333,5,B000F1IQIC,"I enjoyed this series very much. It had a lot of action, good story lines, and great actors. Glad I ordered it. Too bad there was only one season.",1275696000,,146,4.068965517241379
8116334,5,B000F1IQIC,I watched this series in 98 when it came out.. it really is good. Don't listen to the other reviews of this series... It has a great intro with great music.  Rio Arnett ( Lamas) and Wiley (Plank) make a great pair.  It should have lasted much longer than it did.. but with low budgets and the writing gets bad as it did here with this show.  Its no RENEGADE but its not intended to be.  Lamas plays a good part.. I would recommend this to anybody who is a Lorenzo Lamas fan.,1255132800,,474,4.064516129032258
