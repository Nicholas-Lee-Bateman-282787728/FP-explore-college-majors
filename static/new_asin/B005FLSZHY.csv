4682805,5,B005FLSZHY,"Watched Season 2 on Showtime and fell in love with it. Bought Season 1 thru Amazon, came early in the mail for starters. So that was awesome. I'm somewhat disappointed in Season 1 though. Looking forward to buying Season 2!!!!!",1314835200,,227,4.7
4682806,5,B005FLSZHY,"Wow is all I can say Season 2 was amazing every episode was so new and fresh they just seem to surprise me more and more. You never knew where it was going to take you. For people who love the drama they give you that, For people who love the sex they give alot of that, style for those who love the fashion,makeup,and hair its really cool to see their style in LA. What I was uncertain about were the new cast members because I was so Team Rose & Natalie season 1 i really wished they were going to be on season 2,but that didn't happen I was suprised to see the new cast members really hold their own and they were fun to watch. The last thing I will say about this season it does to me my opinion that they wanted to maybe attract a younger group that's just my opinion, but regardless of that if your are a fan of season 1 no matter what age you are I say BUY IT you will not regret it.  Spolier Alert Rose season 1 makes cameo appearances YAY. sorry about the non proper use of grammar and punctuations its just a review",1314835200,2,1025,4.0

4682811,5,B005FLSZHY,"Multiple CDs for just a few episodes. I guess that's the sacrifice that must be made when traveling. Good quality picture, no issues.",1405641600,,133,4.826086956521739
4682812,5,B005FLSZHY,"I bought seasons 1 & 2 from DvdBargainBuy. Great seller. Both seasons arrived early together, brand new and in perfect condition. I checked to see if there were scratches on the discs & there were none on any of them. All discs were there, both seasons (disks, cases) were free of any defects. I'm extremely satisfied.",1393977600,,318,4.696428571428571

Hope it runs for many more seasons.
Cheers Kerryn",1359158400,,139,4.833333333333333
4682827,4,B005FLSZHY,Not too bad for a lesbian reality show.... I must say this one wasn't as raunchy as season one though...,1355875200,,104,4.25
4682828,5,B005FLSZHY,"I love this show! It's highly entertaining and does a good job sucking you into the characters' storylines. Our favorite character is Whitney. She's hilarious and fun! There's no 'real' show out there for lesbians, so this is great.",1354752000,,232,4.9743589743589745
4682829,2,B005FLSZHY,"I bought this because I loved season one and was excited that the series was continuing.  But this was way worse to me, to the point where I can't bare to get past disc one.  Maybe this season gets better as it goes on, but the fact that I hate it that much says something.  I don't like how they got rid of almost everyone from season one, this should pretty much be a separate spin off.  And what I really don't like about it is that this show lost it's class and intelligence.  It seemed to be way more about dating drama and partying...what does that sound like, Jersey Shore?  Other than the couple that is trying to get pregnant, this season has a pretty narrow focus on the dating drama which is too much like the dumbed down reality shows on mainstream TV.  It's like how MTV's Real World started out awesome in the early 90s and then turned to crap from the drama and partying...
So if you prefer TV shows like Jerry Springer, new seasons of the Real World, Jersey Shore, or anything on VH1 this might be up your alley.  You would probably like season 2 here a lot better than season 1.  But that's not the case for me, so I guess my review balances out the glowing ones since this is season is in stark contrast to season 1.",1349481600,,1234,4.194915254237288
4682830,4,B005FLSZHY,"The show itself has made progress since Season 1; it's obviously turned into ""Whitney and her story-line"" then everyone else secondary. There are a lot of new girls - and I liked most of them. . but like S1, there are some who need to go before Season 3.
Since Season 3 has already begun (and ended) I know that again, they trimmed the fat (but of course it was all about Whitney).
I'll get Season 3; but I won't be anxiously awaiting it.",1347235200,,438,4.226190476190476
4682831,5,B005FLSZHY,service wasn't the fastest but hey came undamaged and new as i ordered!!!cant wait to watch when i get off work today..pay all my bills and i have entertainment to get me through.,1343865600,,179,4.454545454545454
4682832,1,B005FLSZHY,this show is just another show to follow suit in the reality realm. the last 2 seasons of the l word were rushed and could have been done soooo much better and then they put out this show?!?!?! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!,1335830400,,216,4.425
4682833,5,B005FLSZHY,This show is great. Will definetly be buying season three as soon as its available on Amazon.  I got it in no time and half the price.,1325548800,,134,3.962962962962963
4682834,5,B005FLSZHY,"Loved it,  this is the better than the lesbian drama on showtime...LOL... funny haha.. I know there both on showtime. Any who love Whitney who really just takes charge in most all the lesbian drama in the season. Couple of the couples were rather boring in this first season...loved the fashion dyke...she was super cliche! Wish she would have made it into season 2. Over_all I do recommend this show better than the L word season...real drama is always better than scripted...",1325030400,4,477,4.817073170731708
4682835,5,B005FLSZHY,"I know several fans from season 1 were peeved that in season 2 the original cast did not return.  While that may have been a tad disappointing for some, season 2 is a way better than season 1.  I pretty much enjoyed the balance of drama and growth of a few -- Romi and Whitney -- along with the additions of: Saj, Claire, Kacy, Cori, Francine, Kelsey, and Rachel.  Even the pairings and hook-ups are intense and hot at the same time.  I'm looking forward to seeing season 3 and what's ahead for the future of many of these women after seeing the finale episode.  I hope next though in season 3 maybe we can be introduced to a bisexual woman (yes it's called the real l word but remember Alice and Tina were bisexual on L-Word).  Anyways, great job, Ilene and her team for another fine season of the lives of lesbians!",1324598400,3,817,4.30718954248366
4682836,5,B005FLSZHY,"Love this series. Season two is better in my opinion than season one. Very sexy and hot! Once you start watching it, it's hard to stop.",1324425600,,135,4.230769230769231

8470230,5,B005FLSZHY,"a gift for a lesbian friend.  As usual with order from Amazon, it arrived on time and packaged well to avoid damage. I have seen the complete series and when this Season 2 came on sale I had to obtain the DVD for my friend.  For the most part the acting is superb and the story lines interesting.",1463961600,,296,4.086206896551724
