8552291,4,B00AIUSG4Y,"This is a very good documentary about one of the greatest photojournalists ever to live.  The film itself is not about the life of Donald McCullin.  Instead, it focuses on some of his experiences in the many wars that he was in and shows how such experiences can perpetually affect a human being.  This is precisely what fascinated me about this documentary.

To explain what I mean, I want to give you a little background on Don McCullin.  He was born in 1935 in Finsbury Park, London.  At the time, Finsbury Park was a poor neighbourhood in London.  The famous Seven Sister's Road that crosses through Finsbury Park was a magnet for criminals and scumbags.  So, you can imagine that McCullin was surrounded by crime and violence since he was born.  This man was forced to fight and stand up for himself from a very early age.  In turn, he became a man of very strong character.  If you think about it, how many people have the ""balls"" to become a war photographer and constantly live jumping form war to war?  McCullin was a kid almost certainly destined for failure until he was able to get his hands on a camera and take a picture of a local gang which he sold to a local newspaper for 50 pounds.  That was the beginning of his career as a photographer.  McCullin eventually became an employee of the Sunday Times Magazine.  As a correspondent he went to Biafra to cover the war in Nigeria and eventually ended up in Vietnam among several other places.  After covering several war zones, he self proclaimed himself as a ""war junkie"".  The result of his missions is an archive of truly amazing and sometimes devastating pictures.

For me, the most fascinating thing about this movie is how this tough young man who was almost bloodthirsty in the beginning became a completely different man after many years.  It is this transformation that mesmerised me.  I think McCullin was not to sure or did not fully comprehend what he was doing taking those pictures at the beginning.  He almost was there driven by his streetwise intuition.  However, it became quite clear to me that after he matured and experienced some truly gruesome things, he perfectly came to know what his mission was when taking every single picture.  You can tell by the look in his eyes as an old man, McCullin has given a lot of thought to morality and what his mission really was.  I think that he is is being completely honest but see it for yourself!

I guess sometimes it takes time and experience to be able to put things into perspective.  McuCullin has reminded me of the importance of this.  I would recommend watching this movie, especially if you are interested in photography, history and the tragedies of war.",1439596800,,2693,4.6147368421052635
