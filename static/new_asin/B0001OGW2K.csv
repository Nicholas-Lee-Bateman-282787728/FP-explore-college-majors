8015760,5,B0001OGW2K,I am not sure that the cartoon was called Chucklewood Critters.  All I remember is Rusty and Buttons.  The cartoons are the same as they were when I grew up.  This dvd is jammed packed with cute stories for children. These cartoons allow children to be children.  Very nice product.,1201651200,,282,4.58
