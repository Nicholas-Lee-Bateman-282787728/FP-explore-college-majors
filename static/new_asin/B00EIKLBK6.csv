5916319,5,B00EIKLBK6,"1-14 were great episodes, this is one if not my favorite fantasy series... I wish there were more.. However, I strongly caution anyone against getting the Fairy arc story after this, episodes 15-25... mmmm after all the story from 1-14, all the heartache and heartwarming teary eyed moment's... its kind of pointless to start it all over... not that that arc didn't have it's ups.. which it did, although i liked episode 25 the best of the series because it finally ends what i think Should have ended at episode 14.... nor do i think they should have bothered throwing another love (or trying to) in there.. they had already developed Asuna enough, she was skilled, determined, and beautiful, Asuna the flash.. and no one could compare. Period (my ideal woman carries a sword XD... ) but anyway.. just warning you... if you have to watch it well... can't say i didn't warn you, but... well it doesnt ruin it at least.. it does kinda damage it, but the fairy arc isn't terribly done either.. just draws the story out too long. course episode 25 will have you all teary somewhat, especially the last scene, and a chill goes through your body and you just .. almost catch your breath and smile and think.... time to go home.. oh well thats what i thought when i saw it.. it does end well though so.. oh well there ya go... Im gonna watch that moment again!!!!",1388361600,8,1357,4.542857142857143

5916321,5,B00EIKLBK6,"One of my favorite animes of all time.  In addition, it arrived promptly by the delivery date.  Anyone who's into Sword Art Online should consider buying the DVDs, though they are a bit pricy for 7 episodes.",1385510400,3,207,4.5675675675675675

As Kirito and his parter Asuna help on the front lines, their relationship grows.  But things grow to a head when they get ready to assault the level 75 boss, Kirito realizes that everyones time may be getting short as they realize they have been in the game for such a long time and how they can still be there.  But also suspicions start to rise as both Kirito and Asuna notice that the leader of the most powerful guild in the game has been acting suspicious.  Can the two stars of the world figure out what is going on and clear the game before everyone gets the big GAME OVER?

This is the final part of this story arc, the show really pulls out all the stops in story and character development.  I enjoyed watching the interactions between the two main characters, from their heart filled moments, to meeting a little girl in the woods, to the final confrontation.  I have to admit in this day of fan service anime and corny horror shows, there is at least one show that brings story and life to the characters and this is it.  Enjoy this while I go wait for the next story arc (p.s watched the rest on streaming).",1382918400,,1220,4.3201754385964914

5916353,5,B00EIKLBK6,"This is an excellent show.  I really enjoyed it.  Would definitely recommend if you are an Anime Fan.  Mild fantasy violence, didn't notice any bad language, and little to no sexual content so should be suitable for all audiences.",1431043200,,230,4.846153846153846
5916354,5,B00EIKLBK6,Amazing dvd pick up! I love this series and would recommend buying it if you want to help support the author and the shows development.,1430006400,,135,4.44
5916355,3,B00EIKLBK6,"So this the second half of SAO's Aincrad arc on two DVDs. The box set isn't anything special and with Aniplex's usual insane prices it's hardly worth it unless you're a hardcore fan and have money to blow. The seven episodes are split onto two discs for some reason with minimal bonus features. I purchased this and the first half of the Aincrad arc from a seller named Shawnek and recieved it on time and undamaged, for half of what you pay ordering straight from Amazon. Overall, I would say this isn't worth the money, but SAO is a fantastic anime so I would recommend watching it online instead of giving Aniplex $250 for the series.",1419292800,8,637,4.5
5916356,4,B00EIKLBK6,"It was shipped over super quickly, and my husband and I love watching it! It is a bit expensive, but definitely worth owning for us.",1410825600,,132,4.32

5916359,5,B00EIKLBK6,My favorite character had to be Kirito. he more of a rebel with it come to things even thought this has a kind heart.,1396915200,,117,3.9166666666666665
5916360,4,B00EIKLBK6,"Conclusion of 1st season. Nice anime, several good scenes. Dissapointing lack of any extras save textless intro/ending. If you don't mind the price, it's a good view.",1396051200,,166,5.185185185185185
5916361,5,B00EIKLBK6,Will mankind develop vitual reality for humanity someday? Amazing it would be for people to experience a world with all five-six senses.,1394668800,,136,5.2272727272727275
8605742,5,B00EIKLBK6,Fantastic item only the last episode was cutting it off when Kirito was off to find Asuna in the real world,1501113600,,107,4.142857142857143
8605743,1,B00EIKLBK6,"This is a great series, probably my favorite anime series. Im currently watching it on netflex but wanted to get a hard copy of it to have in case it ever was taken off. Unfortunatly, i recently discovered that Aniplex release the series in 8 volumes (4 for season 1 and 4 for season 2). Then they charge about $60 per volume. So if you buy them here it will be $240 investment for 1 season and a $480 for both seasons. Thats without shipping costs if there are any. I cant justify paying that much for any dvd series. Thats outragous. Im deeply disappointed in how much money they are asking for because it means i cannot get them. Alot of people feel the same. They want people to buy the series and stay away from pirated copies or illegal streaming yet charge $400 or more for two seasons. Unless you have the money to blow i wouldnt buy the dvds until prices are lowered. Unfortunatly this is very disappointing, i love this series.",1467504000,2,937,4.36
8605744,5,B00EIKLBK6,"This is the conclusion of the first season, Kirito fights the game's final boss & frees everyone who's been trapped in the game that's still alive. Yes, this part is pricey yet again for 7 episodes & all of the parts of this series so far are pricey, but it has some awesome boss battles.",1459123200,,288,4.254545454545455
8605745,1,B00EIKLBK6,"This anime has a ton of plot holes, poorly written characters, terrible writing, sexism, a Gary Stue of a protagonist, and one of the worst fanbases ever.",1447977600,,154,4.7407407407407405

8605750,1,B00EIKLBK6,"This review is to add my voice to the growing tally of people who have the moral fiber and courage to stand up and say: ""This is outrageous price gouging!"" Aniplex and the other anime distributors who've raised their prices to a criminal level need to understand something: You are not growing your market. You are killing it. And do NOT give me this rubbish about how it's so expensive to produce. Nonsense. The money to produce this was already made by sales and viewership in Japan. Don't be deceived by all the rhetoric. The money made here in the States, above the negligible disc and packaging cost, is pure profit for them. I love anime. I have shelves full of it at home. I will not, however, be ripped off no matter how much I like a show. I will not pay these insane prices. If this is the trend of the future then I will, regretfully, move on to other entertainment genres.",1438646400,8,884,4.396341463414634
8605751,5,B00EIKLBK6,"I really love how the episodes contained in this DVD set play out. I like how the relationship between Kirito and Asuna develops and becomes one of the main driving forces of the entire show. One of my favorite anime shows I have seen so far. The price is pretty ridiculous, but I guess I was willing to pay for it...",1437696000,,317,4.213114754098361
