This 1992 telenovela would have had a greater impact if I hadn't just watched Corazon Indomable with Ana Brenda Contreras. They share a similar story arc: dirt-poor seorita meets wealthy young seor, but here, Maria Mercedes (Thalia) doesn't master many new skills. She meets a young man when she washes his windshield at a stop light.

That young man had recently had his brand-new bride shot dead in his arms just outside the church where they were wed, so he is traumatized and grieving.

We are mostly focused on his evil mother who has every intention of inheriting the house where they live from her chronically ill nephew, who is equally evil. As the invalid rests on his patio, a young flower vender tries to sell him flowers...or a lottery ticket.. .she is a very enterprising young woman... and he is charmed. She is nice to him with no expectations, so eventually he marries her (on his deathbed) and makes her his heir, simply to thwart his evil aunt as a final slap from beyond the grave. The poor girl did NOT want to marry him and the promise of wealth had no appeal, but he had twisted his logic in such a way that she had reluctantly agreed. She knows she can always sell flowers, wash windshields and sell lottery tickets to support her drunken father and her three siblings. (Did I mention clichs?)

Now she is the villain who stole everything from her dead husband's relatives and the war is on! They decide the best way to circumvent the conditions in their dead relative's will would be for the grieving young man to marry the lottery ticket girl.

This goes as expected with one minor disappointment: One young man who promised to be a villain had his story line edited out of the DVD set. I recognized a very young Fernando Colunga in one of his earliest roles. This gifted actor has gone on to a note-worthy career in other, far better ...sigh... telenovelas.

Expect evil plots, conniving (but sexy) young women, a saintly sister-in-law, a Tarot card reader and lots of pretty clothes. The actor who plays the hero didn't show me much and his evil mother is too over-the-top. Oh well.",1407542400,,2139,4.630606860158311
