2240943,5,B0007TKHF2,"I Love Lucy Season 4 has always been my favorite season. The development in the show's plot seems to unfold more in this season than in any other. Ricky's showbiz career starts to take off, for example.
in these very classic episodes, which spawned many other television sit-coms, Lucy, Ricky, Ethel and Fred travel to Hollywood where Ricky will star in his first hit movie, 'Don Juan'.
During their travels, they stop at Ethel's hometown in New Mexico. She stars in a ""homecoming"" show and thinks that she's the queen---but Lucy and Co. have other plans!!!
A lot of celebrities make cameo appearances on the show during this season. While in Hollywood, Lucy throws a pie into Bill Holden's face, makes John Wayne fall into a box full of wet cement, and sets her nose on fire while trying to disguise herself from her favorite celebrities.
Great, great season! There isn't one single episode that WON'T have you rolling over laughing!
Sound quality is a bit poor, however. Too bad.",1109376000,7,981,4.776470588235294
2240944,5,B0007TKHF2,"I am so pumped about this next season, I Love Lucy.  Price does not matter, although it is a bit outrageous.  I am looking forward to it coming out, some of the episodes, I think, will transition into the California mindset, getting out of New York and into California.

This is so awesome, I hope you get this.",1109116800,2,311,4.327586206896552
2240965,5,B0007TKHF2,"My most favorite season - Trip to California! great DVD, enjoyed immensely. Nice how the dvd's are separated and each episode is clearly advised in the packaging .",1510531200,,163,4.857142857142857

2240967,5,B0007TKHF2,"William Holden will make you laugh over and over.
Lucy puts on a fake nose and catches it on fire...very funny.
You can't go wrong with I Love Lucy...she is the queen of comedy!
All episodes are funny and enjoyable more than once.",1500076800,,230,4.372093023255814

2240969,5,B0007TKHF2,"I purchased this along with the other seasons quite a while ago, but have never tired of watching.  My favorite episode of all time on this series is Hollywood at Last.  Lucy and Ricky and the Mertzes have traveled across country from New York to California so Ricky can make a movie and become a star.  When they arrive, Ricky is invited to the studio for a lunch meeting.  That leaves Lucy all peeved because she wants to hunt movie stars.  She drops Ricky at the studio and that leaves her and the Mertzes on their own.  They decide to go to the Brown Derby Restaurant for lunch and hopefully find movie stars.  They start out well enough, catching glimpses of some stars as they get phone calls and their names are announced on the PA system.  We never see any of the ones whose names are announced, but the little party swoons over them.  After they have been in the restaurant for a while, William Holden walks in and sits at the booth next to them.  Lucy can't resist staring at him and he soon becomes annoyed by her attention and leans on the top of the booth to stare back.  She gets flustered and since she has ordered spaghetti, she winds big gobs of it around her fork and cannot get it in her mouth.  Ethel gets out her manicure scissors and cuts it off.  Lucy soon cannot stand being stared at any longer and announces, ""Let's get out of here"".  They leave hastily and on the way out, Lucy accidentally trips a waiter who is carrying a tray of pie which ends up on William Holden.  She runs out of the restaurant, leaving the chaos behind.  In the meantime, Ricky is at the studio and meets who else, William Holden.  He drives Ricky home and comes in to meet Lucy.  When Ricky comes into the bedroom where Lucy is unpacking, he tells her who is waiting to meet her.  She does not want to go out, but Ricky insists.  She ""freshens up"" by disguising herself with a scarf, glasses and a putty nose which changes shape several times due to Lucy scratching.  Mr. Holden offers Lucy a cigarette and her nose catches fire!  In the end, she confesses that she met William Holden earlier, he makes excuses for her, telling Ricky she was so beautiful she should be in movies, and ends up giving him a big kiss.  I laugh out loud every time I see it!",1494806400,,2255,4.316666666666666
2240970,1,B0007TKHF2,"I received the incorrect version of the I Love Lucy Season 4 DVD. The product is advertised as the version that was released on October 9, 2012. The version I received was released back on May 3, 2005. The outside picture on the DVD case is also very different from the one as advertised. This might not be a problem for some, however, I ordered as depicted the version that was released in 2012 which is quite different from the one I received. The 2005 version has a thick paper case that holds 5 individual plastic cases that hold only one of the 5 DVD disk that comes with the season. The 2012 version as advertised contains all 5 disks contained in a single regular sized DVD case. The version that I received is much larger in thickness and takes up more room.",1494720000,2,766,4.363636363636363

2241046,5,B0007TKHF2,I am so glad that they came out with all the seasons by them selves for the longest time all I could find was season 1 and 2 and than a full box set. every store I seen those items in I always asked for the other seasons by them selves... They kept saying they where not released yet and there was no plans too. I know it would be cheaper to to just buy the box set but it has been easier for someone on a fixed income to buy the seasons indiveidualy as I am able to so when I finish one season I can have a nice thing to look forward to when I order the next. I am halfway through season 4 and I am looking forward to season 5.,1438128000,,628,3.6940298507462686

2241113,1,B0007TKHF2,"When I Love Lucy was one of the most popular shows on TV, I was 10 years old and loved watching Lucy and Ethel with all their antics and humorous escapades. My parents never liked the show and never wanted to watch it with us. Now I know why after ordering the DVD set ""for a walk down memory lane."" I was surprised to discover I don't find them funny anymore. In fact, they're disturbing to me. The I Love Lucy Show in the 1950s provided some laughs but poor modeling for healthy relationships. Perhaps some people would counter with, ""Well, that's the humor, after allit's a comedywhat do you expect?."" Well, my awareness today tells me that what we watch is what we think and what we think is what we become and what we do in our own lives. Just look at the violence in our films and TV shows today.

In Hollywood, the gang gets wrapped up in all kinds of wacky schemes including Lucy getting to become a supermodel in the Hollywood Wives fashion show, Lucy getting a part as a murdered showgirl in an MGM musical, Lucy's attempts to meet Cornel Wilde and Ricky getting the chance to get some publicity in Hedda Hopper's gossip column. In addition to all of the L.A. craziness, weird things happen on the way to L.A. such as the gang being forced to sleep in an ugly cabin next to an old, rundown cafe in Cincinnati, another meeting with Tennessee Ernie Ford and a visit to Ethel's hometown Albuquerque, New Mexico where everyone there is told that Ethel is an aspiring actress. I could go on and on, but if I do, then this review would eventually get boring. So just buy the fourth season and find out for yourself what happens next.",1352764800,,1090,4.482412060301508

2241191,5,B0007TKHF2,"In the fall of 1954 ""I Love Lucy"" was firmly entrenched as the highest-rated series on American TV. Wisely Lucy, Desi and their writers wanted to make the show even more original and involving so the scripts had the couple along with Fred and Ethel going off to California in order for Ricky to do a movie. While in L.A. Lucy met a serious of Hollywood greats like Rock Hudson and William Holden (actors who rarely made TV appearances) and would pave the way for Lucy to bring on other actors onto her following two CBS shows.

 Paramount has released the entire series again in 2012 with new packaging on the heels of the newly fully released DVD sets of ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Here's Lucy"". So now we can enjoy Lucille Ball in all her glory in all her shows for posterity! And this comes at a great low price.

2241214,4,B0007TKHF2,"CBS and Gregg Oppenheimer did a great job searching for 10 missing scenes that had been cut from the original 35mm camera negatives back in 1958.  Using Jess Oppenheimer's personal 16mm recordings, these scenes were extracted and included as bonus content on Disc 5 of the second edition of the Fourth Season set (the first edition had a ""Disc 5"" that was later recalled and replaced with a new disc).

The lost scenes in question include scenes from ""Ethel's Birthday,"" ""First Stop,"" ""Tennessee Bound,"" ""L.A. at Last!"", ""Lucy Gets in Pictures,"" and ""The Dancing Star.""

For those of you who are interested, here is a list of the newly-discovered ""lost"" scenes, presented in the order in which they appear on Disc 5:

1. ""Ethel's Birthday"": Lucy and Ricky discuss Ricky's mother's return to Cuba during dinner with the Mertzes in the Ricardos' living room, wrapping up loose ends from the previous episode (""Lucy's Mother-in-Law"").

2. ""Ethel's Birthday"": After dinner, Ricky displays anxiety about not hearing from Hollywood, foreshadowing the plot of the following week's episode (""Ricky's Contract"").

3. ""First Stop"": During the drive, Lucy reads a ""Burma-Shave"" roadside advertising sign aloud to her fellow passengers.

4. ""First Stop"": Lucy, Fred, and Ethel continue to complain about how close they are to starvation.

5. ""First Stop"": Ricky pulls up to the caf and his passengers exit the vehicle to stretch before going inside.

6. ""Tennessee Bound"": The opening shot of the episode showed Lucy driving the Pontiac down an abandoned back road in Tennessee.

7. ""Tennessee Bound"": After Ricky remarks to Ernie Ford how the Sheriff doesn't seem to be fond of him, Ernie explains how the Sheriff came to believe he was ""engaged"" to one of his daughters.

8. ""Lucy Gets in Pictures"": Ricky and Lucy are seen driving through the gate at MGM Studios.

9. ""The Dancing Star"": Lucy continues explaining how she had lunch ""with"" Clark Gable whilst sitting at separate tables.

10. ""L.A. at Last!"": Bobby the Bellboy reenacts his role in 'Julius Caesar' for the benefit of Lucy, who asked him if he had been in pictures.

These lost scenes are a treasure trove; however, a critical lost scene from Act One of ""The Business Manager"" is not included in these finds.  For that reason alone, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  The picture and sound quality are excellent, but there are no English subtitles; only Spanish.  On sets that receive Closed Captioning, captions are included in the program.",1341187200,5,2490,4.96144578313253

It's Lucy's turn to have wacky adventures in Hollywood with the Mertzes as Ricky stars in a picture. I love this season, and, as with my Waltons Season 1 review, I have one error to point out that just might prove useful if you are confused: on the episode summary of Don Juan and the Starlets, it incorrectly states that Ricky spent the evening with 'five' gorgeous starlets, when in reality it was four starlets that he took to the premire. Again, this really does not matter, but I wanted to inform you that is is, in fact, an error made by the company. I hope you will enjoy or have enjoyed this and the many other wounderful seasons, and if you liked Season 4, watch season five, where Ricky wraps up his Hollywood duties and the friends travel to Europe.

2241220,5,B0007TKHF2,I Love Lucy is a zany comedy from the 50's starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The plot is always kept simple full of painted background scenery and classic one liners. In this Season Lucy and Ricky head to Hollywood to pursue Ricky's movie career. Many movie stars of the time make cameo roles with hilarious consequences. Fred and Ethel come along for the ride and join in all the fun. This is my favourite season as all the characters have well and truly embedded  their characters while still looking fresh. The comedy is suited for young or old and is good viewing for anyone just wants to have a good laugh without all the modern day special effects.

2241257,5,B0007TKHF2,"This season contains the Hollywood storyline with classic appearances by many stars of the day, including Richard Widmark, Rock Hudson, Hedda Hopper, Cornel Wilde, Van Johnson, Eve Arden and Harpo Marx. However, to me, the funniest episode of both the season and the entire series is the appearance by William Holden.

I Love Lucy will always be a classic and one of the most influential sitcoms of all time. However, some of Lucy's schemes got to be ridiculous. That a woman in her 40's could act so childishly sometimes made the viewer wonder if Lucy Ricardo was brain damaged. It's a credit to Lucille Ball's impeccable timing as a comedienne that some of the scenarios didn't seem more ridiculous.

The William Holden episode -- L.A. At Last -- is different, however. Lucy, Fred and Ethel are at the Brown Derby when William Holden is seated in the booth next to theirs. Lucy reacts like most of us would when one of our favorite actors sits next to her -- she gawks, slack-jawed until Holden feels compelled to ""turn the tables"" on her by staring back at her. Unlike many of the ""Lucy"" episodes where we think ""I can't believe she's doing this,"" in this episode the audience completely identifies with her reaction. Of course, most of us wouldn't end up spilling a whole tray of desserts on our favorite star. And most of us wouldn't wear a fake putty nose to disguise ourselves during a later formal introduction. But I'll bet that if I saw, for instance, Scarlett Johansson sitting right next to me, you can bet that I'd gawk (and gawk and gawk and gawk ...). Add to that the great straight man support of Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, William Frawley and a terrific comic performance by William Holden (a very underrated actor) and you've got the makings of one of the funniest sitcom episodes of all time ... and my favorite episode of I Love Lucy.",1196726400,4,1853,4.646341463414634

If you're wondering why should you buy this beloved series on dvd, when you can watch it on any number of channels across the USA or on TVLAND, there are two answers: Quality and Extras.

Paramount, CBS DVD, and Gregg Oppenheimer (dvd producer) realized this and added a number of extra features to entice the buying public and it was well worth it!

EXTRAS
*** RESTORED FOOTAGE - scenes for certain episodes are added back in, which have not been seen since their original air dates

*** FLUBS - showing times when the actors messed up

*** ORIGINAL OPENING SEQUENCE - animated original opening sequence in the special features, meaning the ""heart on satin"" opening is still part of the episodes on regular playback

*** BEHIND THE SCENES - audio featurette/book reading

*** 5 RADIO SHOWS - these are complete episodes of Lucy's radio show ""MY FAVORITE HUSBAND""

QUALITY
*** DIGITALLY REMASTERED - all the episodes have been restored/remastered and perfect! The images are crystal clear and remarkable for black and white tv. There are some instances when about 3-5 seconds of footage is blurry/grainy, but it's limited to the restored footage that was cut when the series went into reruns, so it's not a problem.
And if you watch I LOVE LUCY on dvd and switch to an airing of the show on tv, the difference is really night and day. I never knew how blurry the show was on tv until I watched the dvds.

Anyhow, this is how tv series on dvd sets should be made! And all of the dvd set/seasons of I LOVE LUCY are made with this same great quality.

Edit Update: 06/22/09
I should say that season 4 & 5 are my favorite ""I Love Lucy"" seasons, since these are the ones where they come to Hollywood and then go to Europe. Since buying this set I've watched them numerous times and must say that these are well worth the purchase!",1171497600,7,1933,4.5606936416184976

2241269,5,B0007TKHF2,"Season #4 of ""I Love Lucy"" is, in my opinion, the best year of that forever-endearing (and enduring) television comedy series. The fourth season of Lucille Ball's first TV series originally aired on CBS-TV between October 1954 and May 1955, and includes most of the ""California Trip"" episodes (the last few of which spilled over into the first part of Season 5).

Paramount Studios has issued an outstanding DVD product in ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Fourth Season"", which includes all 30 shows from the series' '54-'55 TV season. And all of these episodes look fantastic on the DVDs too. I can't find any major video or audio blemishes to complain about. There might be a few here and there; but I haven't spotted them yet.

Each of these black-and-white episodes is shown in its proper TV ratio of 1.33:1; with the audio being presented in strong-sounding Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono (as it should be).

To quote from the back of the box, these uncut episodes have been ""magnificently restored and digitally remastered"". After watching them, I'd have to definitely agree with that blurb too.

This 5-Disc collector's set comes handsomely packaged in a durable slipcase box, which holds five plastic cases (the slim type). Each case features different artwork, as well as an appropriate amount of episode information.

And Paramount hasn't been stingy when it comes to special bonus features on these discs either. There is a generous bundle of bonus items here, making this set feel even more like a true ""collectible"".

Extras include --- An ""Audio Featurette"", Restored Music, Original 1950s Animated Sequences, Song Selections, Production Notes, Flubs, Original ""I Love Lucy"" Opening Titles, Spanish Audio Tracks on most episodes, Guest Information, and 5 full-length ""My Favorite Husband"" Radio Shows (starring Lucille Ball and Richard Denning).

An equal number of extra features (and sometimes even more) can also be found on the other five complete-season ""I Love Lucy"" DVD boxed sets that have been distributed by Paramount. Overall, I'd say that the six ""ILL"" sets are some of the very best TV-on-DVD collector's editions that have yet been produced for the home-video market.

Each of the Lucy sets sparkles radiantly in every respect. It's obvious that Paramount and its ""CBS DVD"" division put a significant amount of time and special care into the production of the six DVD sets in the ""I Love Lucy"" franchise, and that special care shows each time I cue up any of these discs.

Lucy's 4th season begins with ""The Business Manager"" and ends (in California) with ""The Tour"". About one-third of the way through this season, the Ricardos (along with their good friends and neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz) begin to prepare for their trip to the Golden State. There are numerous funny episodes as the foursome gets ready for their lengthy journey, but this season really switches to high gear once they reach Hollywood, where many movie stars pop up (and are introduced to the red-haired menace named Lucille).

Some of the Season-Four episodes that make my ""Best Of I Love Lucy"" list include these:

1.) ""Ricky's Contract"" (December 6, 1954) .... Ricky is a nervous wreck as he anxiously awaits a call from Hollywood concerning his movie contract. According to Ricky, this whole ""thin"" has him on ""pins and niddles"".

2.) ""Getting Ready"" (December 13, 1954) .... This episode has the gang still in New York, just prior to leaving on their California excursion. Ricky (regrettably) lets Fred shop for the car that will transport them to the west coast. Fred's choice of automobiles doesn't exactly thrill the group, to say the least. .... ""Let's get out of here before we have to ride the engine bareback.""

3.) ""First Stop"" (January 17, 1955) .... Hilarious antics abound in this classic ""ILL"" entry when the Ricardos and Mertzes spend the night in a rickety (and very noisy) motel on their way to California. The ""moving bed"" scenes always provide ample amusement here; as does the scene in the restaurant, where the only thing available on the menu is the ""special"" (i.e., cheese sandwiches that are probably as old as the aged geezer serving them up). This is a great episode in the ""I Love Lucy"" archives.

4.) ""L.A. At Last"" (February 7, 1955) .... Lucy, Ricky, Fred, and Ethel finally arrive in Hollywood, California (after their lengthy cross-country car trip, which had its fair share of adventure and funny episodes too). ""L.A. At Last"" is also the classic show which has William Holden getting smacked with a pie at The Brown Derby (thanks to Lucy). This episode has got to be one of the best-ever ""ILL"" shows. It's the one I end up watching the most, that's for sure.

5.) ""Don Juan And The Starlets"" (February 14, 1955) .... Lucy is all upset when Ricky doesn't come back to the hotel after a night of partying (or so she thinks).

6.) ""The Fashion Show"" (February 28, 1955) .... Lucy talks Ricky into letting her buy a dress at a fancy dress shop (the ""Don Loper Salon""). .... ""You cannot explain five hundred dollars for one dress! Take it back!"" --> ""I can't."" --> ""Why not? Don't tell me it was on sale?!""

7.) ""The Star Upstairs"" (April 18, 1955) .... Cornel Wilde puts in a guest appearance as the ""star upstairs"", and Lucy just HAS to cook up a scheme to see him (naturally). The ""ventriloquist"" scene with ""Bobby the Bellboy"" (played by Bob Jellison) is a highlight of this episode.

8.) ""The Tour"" (May 30, 1955) .... Lucy and Ethel's bus tour through Hollywood ends with the usual ""Lucy's In Hot Water"" mess. Richard Widmark guest stars. The funniest part of this show (IMO) is when the aggravated bus driver/tour guide shoves his microphone in Lucy's face (""...and I hear she wears nothing but black lace lingerie...what ARE you doing?""). LOL.

----------------------

""I Love Lucy: The Complete Fourth Season"" is as good as this TV series gets, in my view. It's a season that is packed with many highly-memorable episodes with Lucy and Ricky (and assorted friends, relatives, and movie stars of the 1950s).

If funds were in short supply, and I could only afford to pick up one season of ""I Love Lucy"" on DVD, I'd have no hesitation in making it this 4th-year boxed set. It's a dandy.

2241271,5,B0007TKHF2,"I LOVE LUCY ran for six seasons on CBS, from 1951 until 1957.  It is precious to me because I was born in January 1951--too early to have seen the series originally, but able to view it with great nostalgia now.  Even Lucy and Desi's incessant smoking of the sponsor's Phillip Morris cigarettes has a chilling fascination when one realizes that both actors died of lung cancer.  All six seasons of the show have been beautifully restored and remastered, and are presented complete and unedited at an affordable price at last.  Paramount Home Video has included program notes, long-banned original animated Phillip Morris (and later some laundry detergent) opening credits, restored footage cut for syndication and unseen in decades, cast lists, and five episodes of the radio comedy ""My Favorite Husband"" with Lucy and Richard Denning.  Episodes range from 30 to 39 episodes and come in five slim-pack boxes inside a bigger box--this is class all the way, a model that infamously shoddy Universal should take a lesson from.

SEASON FOUR of ""I LOVE LUCY"" has our quartet meeting Hollywood stars, like William Holden at the Brown Derby, Harpo Marx with a supposed mirror, Van Johnson, Cornel Wilde, and Richard Widmark at his home.  Actually, Ricky is there on business to play a role in some movie.  Lucy, Ethel, and Fred are just along to try and see movie actors.  It takes until the third of five disks for the quartet to reach Hollywood, followed shortly by a mother-in-law who can never remember Ricky's name.  Two of the funniest episodes are actually on disk two, when Fred first buys a car that has to be seen to be believed and when Lucy and Ethel go driving without licenses or lessons.  (Question:  Where is John Wayne's cameo in the classic episode with Lucy and Ethel removing of his footprints outside Grauman's Chinese Theater?  Since we have all 30 complete season four episodes here, it must be in season five.)

This is world-class comedy with its flawless performances; magnificent writing (by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr.); direction by William Asher; and pioneering use of a three-camera videotape, live show technique by 1930's horror film cinematographer Karl Freund and Executive Producer Desi Arnaz.  And with Phillip Morris as the sponsor, you now know why everyone is smoking so damned much during the shows.

I don't know how Netflicks rents multi-disk miniseries, like I LOVE LUCY (or LEAVE IT TO BEAVER or the original THE TWILIGHT ZONE).  There are six or seven episodes on a LUCY disk, plus an episode of ""My Favorite Husband."" from the golden age of radio comedy.  I say that if any TV show is worth buying, it is I LOVE LUCY.  Paramount Home Video has again done of peerless job with LUCY in terms of both show remastering and bonuses at a good price for collectors.  They have created the model for others to follow with TV series uncut on DVD.",1157155200,,2900,4.820202020202021
2241272,5,B0007TKHF2,"It's amazing how fresh and funny this series still seems after more than fifty years and I don't know how many viewings.  My two younger sons, aged eight and five, watch it with me and are as enraptured as I am.  Lucille Ball herself is dazzling, but Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance and William Frawley all give wonderful and hilarious performances too.  What a marvellous team they made.

This series contains some classic episodes.  'Ricky's Contract' is painfully funny, as are 'Getting Ready' and 'Lucy learns to drive'.  One of my favourite episodes is 'Ethel's Home Town' where Ethel puts on a show for her admiring friends and relatives, and the other three, relegated to backstage, take a spectacularly funny revenge that had my second son rolling on the floor in helpless laughter.  And then there's the wonderful episode in the Brown Derby, where Lucy makes eye contact with William Holden, and of course the sublime episode where she and Harpo Marx recreate the mirror scene from 'Duck Soup'.  Pure magic.

No other show comes close to matching the charm and inventiveness of this one.  Pure delight.",1146614400,3,1104,4.887096774193548
2241273,5,B0007TKHF2,"Lucy and the gang head for Hollywood in their best season.

Disc Five:

The Star Upstairs - Lucy has ""met"" 99 stars and wants to make it an even 100 when she learns that Cornel Wilde is hiding out in the hotel.  Even though Ricky forbids her to pester him, she sneaks into his room but then can't get out.

In Palm Springs - The gang has had enough of each other's ""annoying habits"" and the girls go Palm Springs to get away but they realize it's no fun without the boys.  The boys realize the same and sneak out and enlist Rock Hudson to soften them up.  If there had been a guest actor Emmy in those days Rock would have won.

The Dancing Star - Carolyn Appleby springs a visit on Lucy and is expecting to see all the stars that Lucy has been writing about.  When Carolyn arrives and Lucy finds out that she cannot see without her glasses, Lucy tells Carolyn that she will be practicing  with Van Johnson (his dance partner is a red head.)  But when Carolyn shows up to see the practice with her glasses, Lucy must find a way to make her lie truth.

Harpo Marx - After the near miss with Carolyn, Lucy opens her big mouth again and tells Carolyn about a party she is hosting with a lot of big stars.  When Carolyn postpones her flight, Lucy must figure a way out to fool her again.  In the end, Ricky sends Harpo Marx up to impress Carolyn.  This winds up with a classic scene where Lucy (dressed as Harpo) and Harpo perform a mirror act that is a true classic. (One of Lucy's first films was the Marx Brother's Room Service.)

Ricky Needs an Agent - Lucy is tired of Ricky not making a movie and decides to take things in her own hands.  Do I need to say more.

The Tour - Ricky is having lunch with Richard Widmark but Lucy is not invited.  So she and Ethel go on a tour of Hollywood star's homes.  When they come to Widmark's home, Lucy goes over the wall the get a Richard Widmark grapefruit to go with her Robert Taylor orange.  But how is she going to get out!

DVD EXTRAS: Each disc has the following extras -

Flubs - Since the show did not do retakes, there were often misread lines, adlibs or set mistakes.  Sometimes it was continuity errors with things like names changing (Ethel had three different middle names during the show.)

Guest Cast - A listing of each actor on the episode with a brief bio of the actor.

Original Openings - We all think that the satin heart is the original opening for the show but it is the syndicated opening.  Each disc has the original stick figure openings for the episodes.

Special Footage - Each disc contains either music cues that were edited for syndication and special scenes filmed for special occasions or charity promotions.

Lucy's Radio Show - Each disc has an episode of Lucy's radio show My Favorite Husband.  Many of these radio episodes inspired I Love Lucy episodes.

Script Excerpts - Discs 1, 2 & 4 have script excerpts

Production Notes - Discs 1, 2 & 4 have production notes

Disc 3 - Behind the scenes featurette

Disc 5 - Behind the scenes slide show",1146268800,22,9775,4.25734494015234

2241292,5,B0007TKHF2,"Season 4 of this classic show finds Ricky, Lucy, Fred, and Ethel traveling to Southern California so Ricky can star in a movie.  This season has some of the funniest episodes of the show with movie star guest stars.

The first few episodes start out looking like the previous season with some antics in New York with ""The Business Manager"" and ""Lucy Cries Wolf.""  But before the first disc is over, Ricky's been potentially offered a chance to star in ""Don Juan.""  The rest of the season focuses on that storyline as they wait to hear, plan the trip, drive cross-country, and finally make it to Hollywood.  Along the way, we get some truly classic moments as the three others try to crash Ethel's big solo show, Lucy hits William Holden with a pie, Lucy gets a part in a picture, Harpo Marx pops by for a visit, and Lucy gets trapped in Richard Widmark's house.

I had forgotten just how good some of these episodes are, even ones I knew I liked.  The writing and acting were in peak form this season, and the parade of well-known guest stars certainly helped.  To be honest, I'm young enough that some of these names I only know from the show, but that doesn't dampen my enjoyment one bit.  And even when you can see the ending coming a mile away, it still delivers plenty of laughs before you get there.

This show continues to get the treatment it deserves on DVD.  You couldn't ask for a better picture.  The mono sound has been cleaned up as well.  Each of the five discs contains six episodes along with behind the scenes trivia, mistakes, guest cast information, and five episodes of ""My Favorite Husband.""  I was surprised to learn that the show gained a second sponsor during this time, and enjoyed seeing the ads for them.

This may be my favorite season of the show.  Everything gels so well.  If you only get one season, this is the season to get.",1125532800,7,1859,4.452662721893491

Not a wasted frame in the entire episode and a howler from start to finish.  Desi's bravura performance where he destroys the hotel room with bric-a-brac is amazing!!  Why he was never nominated for an Emmy just shows how unjust Hollywood could be!  He was the force behind ""I Love Lucy"" while Lucy of course was force in front!  The episodes here are all gems and I didn't have any problems with any of the episodes.  ""The Fashion Show"" played perfectly on my player...no jerkiness...nothing...just superb quality!!  Other episodes that stand are LA at Last (the William Holden episode), The Star Upstairs (Vivian Vance turns in an outstanding performance in this one...watch for it!!!!), ""Lucy Learns to Drive, The Tour (With Richard WIdmark), Lucy and Harpo Marx, and non-Hollywood episodes like ""Lucy Cries Wolf"", ""Mr. and Mrs. TV SHOW (Phipps are a great big bunch of gyps!!), ""Ethel's Birthday"" (Happy Birthday Mrs. Mertz and I hope you live another 75 years!!) and Lucy's Mother In-Law!

2241310,4,B0007TKHF2,"These sets are everything all TV-shows-on-DVD should be. Great extras, uncut, restored picture and sound, bonus footage, etc. Paramount continues in that same fashion for the Fourth Season set, but for the first time, this one contains a few discouraging flaws and mistakes. Like everyone else, ""The Fashion Show"" has been transfered HORRIBLY. It's missing frames and everything moves ""non-smoothly"" like it's stop motion, but it only shows on parts of the episode. It just comes and goes.

I don't know anything about missing footage from the original versions of the I Love Lucy episodes from their first broadcasts, but from what I've read, a couple episodes in this set have some missing scenes, therefore are incomplete and are syndicated versions. Something I wouldn't notice, but others will and it's a shame because everything before season four was completely uncut. Some people really know their stuff, so I'll take their word for it.

As for the reviewer below, perhaps he can't see the problems in ""The Fashion Show."" And how can some DVDs contain missing footage and others don't, unless Paramount re-released a corrected set without announcing it. I'm still waiting to see someone else with a *perfect* set of season four.",1117324800,5,1236,5.1138613861386135

""The Fashion Show"" plays perfect for me and as for the rest of the episodes, they are pure gold enhanced by the high quality of the DVD set!  This is comedy at its best and I found no flaws on my DVD set.  I give this 5 stars and more!!",1116288000,4,333,3.8529411764705883
2241312,3,B0007TKHF2,"Adding to what the previous reviewer said about picture quality, I too just watched ""The Fashion Show"" episode, and there is indeed a jerkiness to the picture quality in this episode. I thought I was seeing things at first, but I am glad it was not just my imagination. I don't think it necessary to put this season of 30 episodes on 6 discs, when the previous two seasons (containing more episodes) fit on 5 discs with excellent quality.

My BIG gripe with this set, though, is that at least four of the episodes were not restored to their original uncut length. Both ""Tennessee Bound"" and ""L.A. at Last"" had some dialogue in them, which remain missing in this set, even though the original middle break, and end logos of those episodes have been restored. Additionally, ""Lucy Gets in Pictures"" is missing a shot of Lucy and Ricky driving the Pontiac through the gates of M.G. M., while ""First Stop"" is missing a good minute of footage (an extra scene in the car, and a scene when they arrive at the motel, before they actually enter). These pieces of footage remain unrestored and missing on this set, when it would appear that original prints were available to be used. What remains here, on this set, are the same 'uncut' syndication prints that have been around for decades.

I realize that many fans have probably never even seen this missing footage, since it's not been shown since the '50s (and so, may not miss it), but having seen the wonderful degree of care that was put into the previous three season sets, I find it inexcusable that the same care was not taken for this set. This is my favorite season, and I really looked forward to this set. Now, however, I feel (a la Lucy in ""Mr. and Mrs. TV Show"") gypped.",1115510400,34,1725,4.5256410256410255
2241329,3,B0007TKHF2,"Until now, all the Lucy DVDs have been nothing short of spectacular. The picture is as sparkling as it possibly can be and the sound is clear as a bell.

I just got my Fourth Season I Love Lucy boxed set today and have seen about half the episodes. They are as wonderful as I have come to expect.

Then, I started to watch ""The Fashion Show"", and was startled by the jerkiness of the video. It looks like watching a mpeg video on the internet, where the number of film frames have been reduced to cut down on the amount of video information. This problem was only apparent in the first hotel scenes of the episode.

On other episodes, try stopping on any frame, and you will see the picture as a clean, clear photographic still. On ""The Fashion Show"" episode (in the first section), advance the picture one frame at a time. You will find something that looks like horizontal scan lines running through the picture, giving it a ""corduroy"" effect. This is the reason for the jerky movement. Instead of 24 separate pictures per second, we get twelve (every other frame), and the frames inbetween are ""corduroy-blends"" of the frames before and after them. It's the video equivalent of diluting Don Perignon with gutter water.

What a shame.

The producers of this series have spoiled us with perfect quality...so much in fact, that now we are more apt to spot any attempts to ""cheat"". Lucy looks LOUSY, in this jerky-moving format.

I was happy with all the extra goodies on the DVDs--BUT, I would have gladly given them up to have all the episodes looking their glorious best.

It probably happened because CBS DVD-Paramount wanted to squeeze ALL the episodes from Season Four onto 5 discs and had to forfeit quality to do so. I wouldn't care if the last episode from Season Four ended up in the Season Five box, if it meant that ALL the episodes looked as stunning as they have up till now. Lucy on DVD is a testament to its great film quality--I just HATE to see that quality compromised, for any reason. Doesn't ""artistic integrity"" mean anything anymore?

Shame on you, CBS DVD-Paramount! Please go back to the great quality in the first 3 season boxes, the kind that I would gladly give a five-star rating to.",1115424000,10,2211,4.565656565656566
2241330,5,B0007TKHF2,"By now, releases of complete seasons of TV Shows fall into a familiar pattern: 22 to 36 shows, usually uncut, with little or no extras.

The I Love Lucy packages have been different.  First, an amazing amount of effort has gone into presenting the shows as originally televised...even if that means simply restoring an additional laugh from Ricky or some other relatively minor ""trim"" made for syndication.

Second, there are lots of extras.  There are ""flubs"", such as Lucy and Ricky's new Pontiac appearing in the process shot behind Lucy and Ricky, as they sing ""California, Here I Come.""  There are biographies of anyone who spoke a line in the show.  There are the various different openings (and closings) of the shows.  Book excerpts from the original producer, complete radio shows from Lucille Ball's My Favorite Husband series, script excerpts for lost scenes, or from scenes that are not that clear as broadcast.  There are even some extra scenes that were shot to frame reruns that ran in-season.  In other words, there is lots of stuff not seen or broadcast in 50 years.

And of course, this was a classic season. There are lots of classic bits, and even some less famous sequences are amazing.  In Lucy Learns to Drive, for example, Lucy explains to Ethel here disastrous attempt to take the damaged Pontiac to be repaired.  Her description of this off-stage event is perfectly timed and hilarious.

In order to star in the upcoming mvie ""Don Juan"", Ricky is whisked off to California to set his sights on the silver screen, and of course, in tow, brings Lucy, Fred and Ethel. The writer, sensing a goldmine ahead, didn't rush the foursome out to the Golden State right away, but let the momentum build up. The pre-traveling episodes are as rich as the rest of them. A particular favorite is when Ricky buys the car they plan to drive out in and Lucy needs to learn to drive it. Another, Fred packing the car a little too full. Once on the road, the foursome experience many adventures along the way, including a revisit of the hilarious Tennesse Ernie Ford and a visit to Ethel's home town.

Once they land in Hollywood, though, watch out. Viewed together, these episodes are the some of the best in the series. The acting and comedic timing of all four leads is impeccable. The writing is high quality and without fault. The plethora of guest stars that dance through the episodes are some of the brightest in the mid 50's, including a classic episode with Harpo Marx.

Were I to tell someone who hadn't ever seen one episode of this amazing show, I'd plug them into this season first. Certainly, its a great introduction to one of the greatest series ever.",1115164800,41,1532,4.51985559566787
2241332,5,B0007TKHF2,"Widely considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, show in television history, I Love Lucy signaled the ascendance of the prime time TV era. The brainchild of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, I Love Lucy revolutionized the television industry with its extensive use of a live audience and the employment of multiple camera angles. The result of true comic genius, the show's ability to entertain is just as relevant today as it was fifty years ago...

Real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz play the prominent roles of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, a married couple living in a New York apartment complex. Ricky is a Cuban-born band leader who wows night clubs with his act, while Lucy is a homemaker. Lucy and Ricky's best friends are landlords Fred and Ethel Mertz who often become intertwined in Lucy's get-rich-quick schemes, screwball ideas, and comic shenanigans. Former masters of the stage, the cast comes across as a likeable bunch, with Lucille Ball stealing the show with her goofy antics and brilliant facial contortions. If ever there were a television classic, then I Love Lucy is it...

The I Love Lucy (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Lucy Cries Wolf"" in which Lucy becomes uncertain of Ricky's dedication to her welfare and safety. Despite Ricky's assurances that he will rush home in the middle of his act if she were in danger, Lucy decides to put Ricky's promise to the test... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The Business Manager"" in which Ricky hires a business manager to take control of the Ricardo household budget, and ""Getting Ready"" in which the Ricardo's and the Mertz's decide to drive to Hollywood in a 25-year-old used Cadillac purchased by Fred...

2241334,5,B0007TKHF2,"Over 50 years ago during the early years of broadcast television, the very inspired talents of Lucille Ball (1911-1989) and her then husband Desi Arnaz (1917-1986) were showcased on their hilarious television show ""I Love Lucy"". TV execs had initially rejected the plausibility of the show because of Desi and because they intended to tape the shows. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of Lucille Ball and Desi's obvious talents, the show first aired in 1951 and quickly became one of the most successful TV shows during all six of its regular seasons. As Lucy and Ricky Ricardo on ""I Love Lucy"", Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were joined by William Frawley (1877-1966) and Viviane Vance (1909-1979) as their best-friends/apartment landlords of Fred and Ethel Mertz.

The fourth season of ""I Love Lucy"" that aired between 1954 and 1955 has 30 memorable episodes:

1. ""The Business Manager"": Ricky's hired business manager (Charles Lane) for Lucy's household budget only allows her $5/month to spend.

2. ""Mertz and Kurtz"": When Fred poses as a real-estate tycoon to impress an old vaudeville partner (Charles Winninger, 1884-1969), Lucy helps by posing as the Mertz' maid.

3. ""Lucy Cries Wolf"": Lucy's multiple phony attempts to see if Ricky will rush home to save her finally backfires.

4. ""The Matchmaker"": In spite of Ricky's objections, Lucy tries to get two singles to propose to one another.

5. ""Mr. and Mrs. TV Show"": Ricky's reluctance to do a live morning TV show with Lucy from their apartment backfires for Lucy when she tries to get back at him by sabotaging what she believes is only a dress rehearsal.

6. ""Ricky's Movie Offer"": When a talent scout comes to audition Ricky at the Ricardo's apartment, Lucy isn't about to give up her big chance.

7. ""Ricky's Screen Test"": Lucy wants more than a bit part in Ricky's audition for ""Don Juan"".

8. ""Lucy's Mother-in-Law"": Lucy tries to impress Ricky's mother on visit from Cuba by having a Spanish-speaking translator on an earphone.

9. ""Ethel's Birthday"": Fred asks Lucy to pick out Ethel's birthday gift, Ethel's reaction angers Lucy with hilarious results at a play.

10. ""Ricky's Contract"": Overly anxious to hear back from Hollywood, Fred leaves a phony message that Ricky got the part, but Ethel can't get there fast enough to prevent Lucy from telling Ricky the ""good"" news.

11. ""Getting Ready"": When the gang decides to drive to Hollywood, Fred purchases an old used car.

12. ""Lucy Learns to Drive"": When Ricky gets a new convertible, Lucy insists that she learn to drive; but when Lucy wants to teach Ethel, uh oh!

13. ""California, Here We Come"": Confusion ensues when Lucy's mother (Kathryn Card, 1892-1964) decides to join the car trip to California, but a better decision is made as Lucy, Ricky, Fred & Ethel head west!

14. ""First Stop"": With everyone tired of riding in the car, Lucy pulls over to a run-down restaurant/hotel.

15. ""Tennessee Bound"": When Ricky is arrested for driving too fast, it's up to good ol' Cousin Tennessee Ernie Ford (himself, 1919-1991) to save the day.

16. ""Ethel's Home Town"": When the gang stops in Albuquerque to visit Ethel's family, Ricky, Lucy & Fred aren't happy when the whole city thinks that Ethel is the star.

17. ""L.A. at Last"": Lucy, Fred & Ethel eat the famous Brown Derby where Lucy makes a mess of William Holden (himself, 1918-1981) in a nearby booth.

18. ""Don Juan and the Starlets"": Lucy wants a divorce when it appears that Ricky stayed out all night with five starlets.

19. ""Lucy Gets in Pictures"": Lucy finally gets her big chance to appear in a film thanks to Ricky, but the headdress is too much to handle.

20. ""The Fashion Show"": Lucy finds a way to get a free original Don Loper (himself, 1906-1972) dress; but she quickly learns that sunburns and wool don't mix.

21. ""The Hedda Hopper Story"": Lucy tries to further Ricky's career by trying to impress the rumored hotel guest Hedda Harper (herself, 1885-1966).

22. ""Don Juan is Shelved"": When Ricky's movie is shelved, Lucy tries too hard to make Ricky popular and get him another role.

23. ""Bull Fight Dance"": When Ricky lets Lucy appear with him on a TV show, she's not too happy about being a bull.

24. ""Hollywood Anniversary"": Ricky frantically attempts to find out his forgotten anniversary date and plans a huge surprise nightclub party for Lucy, who is miserable thinking that he's forgotten it.

25. ""The Star Upstairs"": Desperately wanting to see Cornel Wilde (himself, 1915-1989) whose hotel room is directly above the Ricardos, Lucy will do anything to see him and ends up trying to climb back down using bedsheets.

26. ""In Palm Springs"": With Lucy, Ricky, Fred & Ethel bored with other, Lucy & Ethel travel to Palm Springs and meet Rock Hudson (himself, 1925-1985).

27. ""The Dancing Star"": To impress the visiting Carolyn Appleby (Doris Singleton), Lucy convinces Van Johnson (himself) to let her dance with him.

28. ""Harpo Marx"": Again to impress the visiting Carolyn Appleby, Lucy pretends to be Harpo Marx, but the real Harpo (himself, 1888-1964) shows up!

29. ""Ricky Needs an Agent"": When Lucy poses as Ricky's agent, she accidentally has his movie contract cancelled.

30. ""The Tour"": Lucy & Ethel leave their Hollywood tour bus so that Lucy can pick a grapefruit from Richard Widmark's (himself) garden.

Paramount Home Video's superb job of packaging all 31 episodes of the third season of ""I Love Lucy"" onto 5 DVD's is a good indication as to how they will similarly package the fourth season.  Overall, for superb packaging and a great price, I rate the ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Fourth Season"" DVD box set with an anticipatory 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it!",1110844800,284,5693,4.854188210961738

2241337,4,B0007TKHF2,"NOTE: If you don't like Lucy criticism please move on to the next review. Thanks.

I am quite surprised that right on the heels of Season Three we are getting Season Four. I was expecting a year's wait for the next Lucy season. I just hope that this does not mean that we will be subjected to a hack job in terms of the DVD production. I was disappointed that on the Season Three set CBS threw in some poor transfers with murky picture quality (""Bonus Bucks,"" ""Sentimental Anniversary"") rather than taking the time and effort to go back to an original negative to create a new pristine transfer. We buy the DVD sets because we want quality not dodgy production.

So what about Season Four? Well, I have to admit I am not a big fan of the Hollywood or European shows. I think it was a little too gimmicky to have Lucy and the gang hobnob with Hollywood stars although I am sure TV audiences of the day were quite thrilled to see these guest stars. I also don't think that the Hollywood shows hold up very well after 50 years. Sadly, younger audiences won't even know many of the stars that Lucy gets so loopy over. How many people under 40 know William Holden, Richard Widmark or Cornel Wilde? Their only exposure to these people would probably be through ""I Love Lucy.""

Of course, some Lucy fans will be outraged that anyone would criticize any of the seasons of the series. Still others, who are fans of Season Four specifically, will be quite perturbed that anyone would criticize their favorite season. I am just laying out my subjective opinions of Season Four.

Season Four is not entirely set in Hollywood though. The first third of the episodes are set in New York, some of which lay the ground work for Ricky's movie offer and the subsequent plans for the trip out west. We also get the introduction of Lucy's ditzy mother who will be staying behind to care for Little Ricky. The four episodes involving the Ricardo and Mertzes cross-country trip are fun and find the foursome in some unusual settings including jail (""Tennessee Bound""). The remainder of the season is taken up by the Hollywood shows (which would continue into Season Five).

Of all the Hollywood shows ""L.A. At Last"" is my favorite. The scenes involving Lucy spying on William Holden in the Brown Derby are fun and the pie scene in the restaurant is funny. The best scene of all is when Lucy, in disguise, finds her putty nose on fire. This was an inspired Lucy moment and the ad-libbed bit when she dips her nose in the coffee cup is a great touch.

The other classic Hollywood episode in this set is ""Lucy and Harpo Marx"" which contains the famous mirror scene when Lucy mimics Harpo. Other than ""L.A. At Last"" and ""Lucy and Harpo Marx"" I don't care much for the other Hollywood shows in this set. The ""guest star of the week"" theme gets kind of monotonous after a while.

It may have seemed like a great idea to parade stars of the big screen on ""I Love Lucy"" 50 years ago but, ironically, Lucy's fame has far surpassed the fame of the ""big"" movie stars who guested on her series. She is still a household name while many of her guests have faded into obscurity. This makes many of the guest star appearances rather irrelevant.

I would give Lucy five stars because she deserves them but I would give the season itself three making my overall rating about four stars for Season Four.",1110240000,13,3363,4.483660130718954
