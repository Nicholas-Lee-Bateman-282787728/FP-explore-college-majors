8541557,5,B009H3LODI,"This movie is definitely a low budget, indie film so if you're looking for Hollywood quality - prepare for a disappointment!  But what you are going to get from this movie is a fun romp from someone who clearly likes to make movies.  Effects are done on the cheap and there are some actually pretty good effects for what they're working with.  Also, the cast is clearly having fun and enjoying themselves - they are engaged and playing up their characters without camping it up too much.

8541559,3,B009H3LODI,"Rich (James Balsamo) sells comic books and has trouble with women as can be expected. When the demon Az (Billy Walsh) comes along looking for a soul, Rich's life picks up. The film is low budget punk. There is little continuity in the feature, mostly short scenes strung along. The scenes are hit and miss, with more on the miss side. The zombies come in near the end and are light on decent zombie effects.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, ample nudity.",1388620800,,451,4.567901234567901
