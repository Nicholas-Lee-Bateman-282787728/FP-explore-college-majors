6601913,5,B00MU9H92G,"From the directors of ""Amer"".
That's all I needed to attract me to view this film.
I knew what to expect from ""Amer"".

It was more than I expected to say the least. It was beautiful, haunting, and full
of amazing cinematography.
It was a tribute to the giallo genre which is one of my favorite genres of all time.

This is a must for any fan of horror or giallo specific. It's done in a more experimental/avant-garde interpretation and done wonderfully.

I hope these two directors continue in the same vein of filmmaking. It's beautifully done. Don't listen to those that dismiss as pretentious. You'll miss out.",1410393600,16,613,4.657407407407407

6601923,3,B00MU9H92G,"Just as visually attractive as Bava senior or the once great Argento , but the very slight story takes forever to tell and perhaps was not intended for sober viewers .

6601924,5,B00MU9H92G,"A word or two of context.

Art Nouveau, also known as Jugendstil, was in many ways the final flourish of a European culture of hand crafted art that survived the pit of the dark ages but was not able to survive the ravages of the cruel 20th Century with its totalitarianism and military industrial complexes. It was on many levels the collective expression of hundreds of artists, artisans, poets, architects, actors, models, an organic evolution of a feminine ideal of beauty that was, however evanescently, realized in the moments before that generation of artists went off to meet their untimely demise in the trenches of the first World War. So many real lives were lost, and their style itself has become a symbol for what the world might have been if not...

Auteurs Roman Polanski and Dario Argento are both acutely aware of the beauty of Art Nouveau and each, in their own way, has used its aesthetic to accentuate their own expressions of cinematic woe, and I doubt either would begrudge the clear fact Hlne Cattet, along with Bruno Forzani and an amazing ensemble cast, has captured and even resurrected the essence of Jugendstil in all its tragic aesthetic in a way that neither male director ever did or ever could, while at the same time paying a wonderful and loving homage to those who have explored this dark, sensuous Fin de Sicle world before her.

You won't get it all on your first viewing. I've watched it at least four times now and am still discovering new things, like the split second early on in the film when a door slams and Klaus Tange's image for a split second turns into a black abyss in the voluptuous, tropical palette of the background that makes every moment of this perfectly realized work of horror art a sumptuous feast for the eye, mind and soul.",1421625600,2,1786,4.663492063492064
6601925,5,B00MU9H92G,The cinematography alone is worth the price of admission. An extraordinary achievement.,1421193600,4,87,6.333333333333333
6601926,4,B00MU9H92G,"A man returns home from a business trip to find his wife missing, the door of their apartment chained from the inside. As his search becomes more frantic, he questions the other tenants of the luxuriously baroque apartment building, before a suspicious police inspector finally gets involved. Characters recall incidents in their own lives that mirror what is happening with Dan (our protagonist), while a gloved, knife-wielding killer caresses naked flesh. With a tip of the hat to Italian gialli, The Strange Color of Your Bodys Tears quickly moves beyond that genre to become a perplexing, surreal horror story of murder and madness. The supernatural undertones are reminiscent of The Haunting: the apartment building seems to breathe, makes ominous sounds and may have a life of its own (parts of the movie also bring to mind David Lynchs neo-noir horror film, Lost Highway). The tenants, too, are suitably obtuse, with various secrets and kinks hidden away behind their doors. Dan, himself, may not be what we first think him to be. Played by Danish actor, Klaus Tange, Dan is anguished, desperate and terrified, and maybe more than a little deranged; but then, all the characters in the film including (especially) the investigating detective seem pretty far off the rails.

Theres a lot of nudity (male and female) and sex in Strange Colors but its appropriately arty and tastefully done. The bloody violence, also abundant, is graphic but filmed with a high degree of precision and elegance, incongruous as that may sound; you won't need to bring along your air sickness bag, in any case.

With its doppelgangers, flashbacks and red herrings, repetitious nightmares and brutal murders, The Strange Color of Your Bodys Tears is a labyrinth of a film, layering mystery upon mystery, enigmatic and tantalizing to the very end. Some may accuse filmmakers Bruno Forzani and Helene Cattet of putting on a show with lots of style and no real substance, but I don't agree with that. The same thing was said about the pairs previous project, the mysteriously alluring Amer, but beneath the artsy glamour and beautifully photographed interiors, theres an intriguing story being told in the form of a puzzle. You may put the fragmented pieces together and figure it out, you may notI watched it twice and Im still not sure if I figured it outbut somehow I didn't mind. This is a feast-for-the-eyes film that offers much, gives up little but reveals more with each viewing.",1420761600,,2469,5.004866180048662
6601927,2,B00MU9H92G,Very strange film,1419465600,,17,5.0
6601928,4,B00MU9H92G,"The second feature from Helene  Cattet and Bruno Forzani, ""The Strange Color of Your Body's Tears"", is an obvious and emblazoned homage to Italian Giallo filmmakers. It most notably borrows from the works of Dario Argento, with its beautifully bold color pallets and hypnotic and hyper realized visual style, and the thread bare and stripped down plots of a Mario Bava or Lucio Fulci picture. There is also a subtle undercurrent of American filmmakers. The film has the repetition of images,  rhythm and bizarre focus on eyes, necklines and other odd frames of focus of a David Lynch vehicle and the sweeping shots of an Alfred Hitchcock picture. There is the shadowy menace of the German director of 1922's silent classic, ""Nosferatu"" and the ebbing undertones of a Fritz Lang feature. All of this should come as a delight to fellow cinephiles but others may find it too repetitive, another exercise in style over substance and may not be able to finish it.

  In true Argento fashion it attempts to tell a basic story, with little character development or focus on the archetypes that dominate the screen, and awe the audience instead on the increasing outlandishness of what follows and how unconventionally the trite narrative is told.  Strangely, I found myself held between an invisible barrier as the narrative of a man who is pulled into a web of obsessive sexuality and death after his wife goes missing moved forward. Perhaps this was an intentional psychological trick from the directing team, if such is so I give them credit for achieving their unusual goal, but the emotional disconnect often unveiled me appreciating the style without ever being pulled into the main character, heralded by a suitable performance by Klaus Tange, and the underworld in which he was becoming entangled.

  Though the pace is deliberately methodical, the cinematography is sumptuous as you would expect from an Argento imitation. Thus, we can't help but feel the lack of plot in every frame and the boundary built between audience and film is a continuously interchangable source of fascination, admiration and disgusted tedium. Many of the cinematic work's slow motion, black and white images are an example of this.

  There needs to be more to hold this movie together. To its credit, the motion picture does find some of its own footing in the surreal visuals of the second half but the main character searches, as we the viewer do, for clues of what is occurring and that is all we ever receive. Often this makes for some of the most rewarding and memorable experiences in film. I've turned to Lynch's masterpiece,  ""Eraserhead"", and ""Mullholland Drive"" many times in search of what truly lies under its abstract surface. New answers and questions come with each viewing but these are original works of an artist etching his own cinematic flare in his works. Too much of ""The Strange Color if Your Body's Tears"" feels like fanatical imitation and for that the movie never becomes its own entity, the directors never step into their own realm and for that the movie suffers.

  Despite this, the movie is satisfyingly weird. It is better looked at as a whole, a puzzle where you must analyze each piece to see the bigger picture. As much of an imposter as it appears for most of its duration it does give you enough of a murky, muddled outline of what is going on near the finale to get your imagination spinning frantically to fill in the holes. Perhaps ""The Strange Color of Your Body's Tears "" is more successful than one viewing may merit.",1418947200,4,3542,4.849087893864013
6601929,4,B00MU9H92G,"Well, to an avid movie fan like me, I do consider it a good sign sometimes if after watching a film I find it necessary to run online to read both GOOD and BAD reviews to help me determine what I actually THOUGHT of the damn thing. I am a giallo fan, and a horror fan, and I'm an artist. So I have no problem with style over substance filmmaking. But I would guess that only a quarter of fans of thrillers, horror or giallo are going to enjoy this movie! It's narrative language is edited for the maximum economy, the most visual impact and is as abstract as filmmaking can get without completely falling apart. I found it very difficult to follow...thank goodness for pause and rewind...because you could miss a detail or plot point in the bat of an eye! And all this highly stylized storytelling also includes flashbacks and dream sequences. I'm still not sure if I correctly surmised who the murderer was or if I even properly understood the backstory. I left being unsure whether it's intended for me to even know who the killer is! But I instantly had a craving to watch it again. To make an astonishing comparison, I could say that I found David Lynch's Mulholland Drive more accessible.

Here are some PROS: This might be the most visually stimulating movie I've seen in a decade. EVERY frame has something to say - whether thru the edit, the color, or the crop. There are split screens. There are kaleidoscopic images. Psychedelic colors. Shattering glass. Mirrors. Photomontages. Doppelgangers. Light effects. Close Ups. Aerial views. Tracking shots. Blinding lights. Deep shadows. There are eyes, eyes and more eyes that contain fear, reflections, dilation. And mind you, all these techniques I just listed are shot in the most glossy, creative and imaginative ways possible. There is also sex, violence and gore. There are at least two visceral and exciting dream sequences/flashbacks unlike ANYTHING you will ever see in a film. There is an incredible soundtrack culled from the best scores from authentic Giallos and Italian movie soundtracks from the past. All of this action takes place in a fashionably annoited, Gaudi-esque apartment building with an attention to color and decorative detail not seen since Dario Argento's ""Suspiria.""

Here are some CONS: There is literally no reprieve from the visual stimulation. The film has no breathing room. It is an ONSLAUGHT! This in turn becomes very REPETITIVE and also distances you from any emotional stake in what's going on. You want to invest in the handsome protagonist's convoluted quest to find his missing wife - but the script gives him little to say or do but stumble into one vignette to the next. Every character is a victim of the audacity of the visual techniques imposed on the film. The film is just too abstract and chilly. If the directors would have given any type of relief for the audience by having some unbroken moments of conversation and narrative, this would have been a huge advantage to the movie. Instead the whole arc is told visually (and rapidly) making for a very frustrating viewing experience. The movie is going to be an endurance test for a lot of viewers. I can easily imagine a large swath of audience hitting eject in the first 25 minutes. I personally loved it, and was completely absorbed in it - but hopefully this review will help clarify for yourself on whether YOU might enjoy it.

To give an example of two movies that have recently been sited as stylish, arty movies that are subversions of form - ""Berberian Sound Studio"" (giallo again) and ""Stoker"" (Hitchcock) - if you didn't care for those, I might stay away. (Although I didn't care for either of those, but liked this film). I thought Strange Colours was very compelling. I understood it's method of constantly repeating, subverting and deconstructing almost every known thriller trope - from switchblades, knives and the black-gloved killer, to hidden clues and traumas buried in the past. There is the woman in red, the suave detective, the hapless hero, the dark corridor, the secret room - hell, there is even a nod to the maggot which you can always find in an italian horror pic. All these things get whittled down to mesmerizing, thriller ""BEATS.""  But the reduction might be too much for the average viewer to ride along with (or even the Above-Average viewer!). If you liked AMER, than you will probably enjoy this too. This movie had very mixed, if not below average reviews when it came out (I understand), but you simply cannot deny the style of this movie. It has to be some kind of milestone of aesthetics and editing on film.",1418688000,42,4606,4.782663316582915

6601932,3,B00MU9H92G,"The title reflects the translated titles of Sergio Martino's films from the seventies, such as ""All the colors of the dark,"" and ""Your vice is a locked room and only I have the key.""  These movies are trippy movies (all starring Edwige Fenech, a character name used in this film) overdue a blu ray release.  Martino's films are technically gialli, but really to my mind differ in that they are more about mood, visuals, and beautiful women (mainly Edwige, naturally).  This film certainly has the trippy visuals, and the soundtrack is also quite lovely, but I found the story and characterizations much less compelling.  I have watched several other movies purporting to be inspired by giallo films, and all but this one have been characterized by excessive mystification in the story (to disguise the lack of a good story) and  upping the gore quotient.  I give this film credit in the story department and cinematography, and think it is close to good (if not superb) but for the lack of a compelling female figure and the byzantine portrayal of the story, which ultimately is too frustrating to entirely enjoy.",1415750400,7,1113,4.862433862433862
6601933,5,B00MU9H92G,"I'm not sure how to even describe this movie to someone who doesn't watch a lot of movies. Maybe take a bunch of drugs and then watch it? It has everything a good neo-noir needs. Unreliable narrator, labyrinthine plot, murder, strange detectives, confusing timelines, a little girl being bribed to hand a man razor sharp candy that cuts him and distracts him from the cloaked women he was following. You know, the usual.

You'll either be completely enraptured here or you'll give up after the first five minutes. It's a very surreal, trippy, non-linear movie. A man's wife goes missing in a weird apartment building and he may or may not have killed her but it might have been the upstairs neighbor or it might have been the detective. We're thrown in and out of everyone's traumas and insanities so abruptly and chaotically that it turns into this beautiful schizophrenic experience like nothing I've seen at the movies before.

I really can't describe this movie. The filmmakers make the most of video and audio and twist it and turn it until your brain is rewired to notice every little noise and flicker of peripheral light. It was amazing. This movie is what people like Terrence Mallick and Lars Von Trier are trying to do, only this movie does it right.",1412640000,20,1261,4.7272727272727275
8674635,4,B00MU9H92G,"I purchased the DVD of this film hoping a second viewing would finally clear some things up.  However, I came away feeling more uncertain than the first time I saw it.  I fear I will never truly understand this one; and possibly that is the objective of its creators.
