8499907,4,B006JZSNHW,"(I started this review 18 months before finishing it  Ive taken a lot of time to muddle over it.)

This is my first time reviewing one of these DVDs, although I own 7 (1-6 and now 8).  Its the first to have 90 videos  before, theyve had either 50, 44, or 66 videos.

Lets understand this:  Anyone trying to put together a compilation  whether it be audio, video, or anything  has to go through getting permission.  You can only feature what you get allowed to.  Nuclear Blast can feature bands signed to them, but that only comprises about 40% of the bands on the DVDs.  The rest have to give permission, presumably from the bands AND their own labels.

So there are some bands we have simply never seen.  It becomes impossible to tell whether this is a conscious decision of Nuclear Blast, or whether they have tried to get permission and not yet succeeded.

But if you look through the booklet, it clearly reads that it is trying to please fans of many different genres (symphonic & gothic; classic and hard rockers; progressive metal; mechanic (industrial); metalcore; pagan/folk; thrash; Djent; gloomy (black); death metal; classical heavy metal, power metal, and melodic metal).

At first glance, that looks like it covers everything.  But the bands that more appropriately fit underground genres yet are often put into more common genres in an attempt to alleviate confusion don't get inclusion.

Given that, my feelings on whats on this DVD and what isn't is as follows:

LEAVE OUT:

1)  Nevermore:  Born  This ship has already sailed!  Final Product from This Godless Endeavor was the last time Nevermore was featured, and it was back on Volume 5.  This must have been some well, Nevermore hasn't done anything new in a while; we better feature them so people don't forget about them (Obsidian Conspiracy wouldnt come out for another 2 years).

2)  the stoner rock/metal - Seventh Void, Monster Magnet, & Graveyard and that cluster of videos about 1/3 of the way through Disc 1.

3)  White Wizzard (actually the humor here makes up for not having quality Edguy or Steel Panther)

4)  Triptykon  maybe its the placement, but this is a mood-killer for me after back-to-back Norwegian black metal to open.

5)  (trim the thrash revival by a band.  maybe Death Angel since theyve been featured before)

6)  Agnostic Front (Ive never felt this punk band should be on this metal compilation)

7)  Madball (again  this is hardcore, not metal).  and this is a European record label putting this DVD out.  it shouldnt be littered with talentless bands that steal fans.

8)  Videos 32-35 on Disc 2  these are screamo/rock bands!  remove them all.  one of them (forget if its Asking Alexandria or Attack Attack after it) has a techno section!  this is a METAL dvd!!!

9  Gurd  Terminate  THIS IS AGONIZING!!!  If you hate Godsmacks I Stand Alone because the name of the song is sung about six trillion times too many, you will hate this song for the same reason.  Lets face it  some metal just makes your head spin & and you helplessly ask yourself:  Why does this exist???  Reminds me of when I had to put up with watching The Agonist live before Firewind and Sonata Arctica came on stage.

INCLUDE NEXT TIME:

1)  Japan somehow!!  How can we have this new Djent stuff and all of these metalcore bands that are well on their way to being the next fad  just like the nu-metal it was born from  when the visual kei style that has been going on in Japan since the 1980s has yet to have a single band featured on a Monsters of Metal DVD?!  Not even Direngrey (who has played at Wacken) or X-Japan or Blood Stain Child have been featured yet.  This is a major gripe of mine.  Not even Galneryus  have you seen their video for Angel of Salvation?  Magnificent!

2)  Pathfinder  our problem here is that Nuclear Blast is a German label and tend towards the more rock-side of metal (think Accept, Scorpions, and later Edguy).  Its still a wonder they ever signed Secret Sphere and Rhapsody of Fire out of Italy.  Nuclear Blast doesnt seem to see a lot of brightness in epic power metal.  The Lord of the Wolves would look great on one of these DVDs in my opinion.
3)  Manticora  This band has long since proven itself worthy.  Something from Safe should have been on here.

4)  more progressive metal  Anubis Gate, Lance King, Pyramaze, Cloudscape, Pagans Mind, etc.

5)  Sirenia (theyre actually ON Nuclear Blast while Tristania is still on Napalm)  and the amazing Seven Widows Weep isn't on volume 9!  This is outrageous!  This is the return to gothic metal that purists (fans of Theatre of Tragedy, The Sins of Thy Beloved, old Within Temptation, old Tristania, Penumbra, etc.) have been waiting for!

6)  Swedish black metal, ex. Watain, Marduk, Ondskapt  even a live video of Necrophobic or Lord Belial at a festival like Party San would do.

7)  some lesser-known Finnish melodic metal, ex. Cardiants Stars Upon Your Life

8)  I don't like how the core bands are taking away from the good-clean-fun melodic death metal bands in Kalmah, Ensiferum, Dark Tranquillity, Norther, Tracedawn, Mors Principium Est, Sympuls-E, etc.  Why aren't these featured?  This DVD series is tending towards the trendy side, and thats a little unnerving.

So there really is a lot of room.  About 13 videos from my leave out list could be replaced with videos from the include next time list and youd have a representation that would be even more all-encompassing.

Id also like to put in some praises for bands that finally did make it on here.  Welcome Melechesh!  It is very exciting to finally see you on here!  >>> and you see, thats the way I feel about many other bands.  There are a lot of bands who deserve a shot at being on one of these DVDs.  I remember how excited I was a couple of volumes ago when I finally saw Brainstorm make an appearance.  I suppose the bummer revolves around the fact that Nuclear Blast Records puts these DVDs out, so naturally, they have to justice to the bands they have signed to them by putting their material on here.  There are few bands Im happy to see here for the first time  Dream Theater and Draconian are nice to see as well.

I liked what was done back on the first three volumes (especially the first).  Since it was just the first, the videos selected weren't just from the last 18 months worth of metal music videos, but some of them went back pretty far.  (The Gathering, Iron Maiden, Emperor and on volume 3, when they didn't have any new bodom or Stratovarius videos, they went back to Downfall and Hunting High and Low).  But then the series went onto Volume 4 without ever going back to fill in any of the remaining missing pieces.  For example, Im stunned that weve never seen Burzums Dunkelheit.  There could be any number of reasons, most noteworthy being permission from the band.  Its sad to see these lost videos never appear while we have to sit on watch each and every new Dimmu video flood the opening slots on the discs.

After all of this discussion, the key thing I don't know is what the selection process is.  Maybe its like March Madness  maybe theres a last 4 in and last 4 out.  And the Nuclear Blast bands get the automatic bids.

Theatrical metal continues to be the dominant selling point as Nightwish and Dimmu open their respective discs (insert Pathfinder complaint here).  Then, as is typical in the DVD series, the discs go through clusters of related bands (ex. Leaves Eyes, Tristania, and Draconian together early on Disc 1 to formulate a gothic metal cluster).  Theres also the retro cluster about 1/3 of the way through Disc 1 that I put in my leave out list.  It just totally puts to sleep any energy that the surrounding bands generate.  Im not going to phrase my complaint by saying these bands aren't metal; call it what you will.

To end on a good note, the production/presentation is top-notch as always.  This volume actually has both Blu-Ray and DVD, so regardless of what player you have, this one item will serve your needs.  The DVD digibook is housed in a slipcase for protection.  Though, I don't like how the discs on top aren't secured very well and fall out easily.  I rarely finger through the booklet for fear of discs dropping to the floor.

At the end of the day, this is a job well-done for Nuclear Blast.  90 videos is a lot more than ever before (though, this got cut in half for volume 9).  If you take out the 13 mistakes, 77 is still more than ever before.  Ill still keep an eye on this series, but I might skip 9 just as I skipped 7.",1444003200,,8525,4.568302387267905
