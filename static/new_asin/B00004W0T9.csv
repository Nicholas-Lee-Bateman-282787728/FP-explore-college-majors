1359156,4,B00004W0T9,"A tale about heroin abuse and prostitution amongst teens in Berlin, featuring snippets of Bowie in concert. Unfortunately I read the book first, and the movie disappointed, since there's very little of the character development and large parts of the plot were cut. It's probably a valuable historical document and ties in with Bowie's Germanic angst as found on his 70s albums ""Low"" and ""Heroes.""",1030233600,,397,5.123076923076923
1359157,5,B00004W0T9,"When the Region 2 version (UK) of this film became available two years ago, I jumped at it, knowing that I had set my old computer DVD player to region 2. Now that I've found that the American release is slightly shortened and is only dubbed, I'm thankful that I ordered my copy from amazon.co.uk! The UK version is in the original German and has excellent subtitles...

document of the perils of pre-HIV drug abuse

The english dubbing is ok, but the voices don't really go with the actors appearance and how you'd think they would sound. The movie is supppose to be a realistic look at drug use and how some teenagers live. The Bowie music goes great with the atmosphere of the movie. I would like to be able to hear the actor's own voices and read in english though and I hope they release another version with subtitles.",1004400000,4,487,4.4222222222222225
1359160,4,B00004W0T9,"Relatively unknown in America, the street/drug scene in Germany in the 80's. I think a lot of Americans might find this interesting, especially those who have traveled. I enjoyed it.",997747200,,182,5.1
1359161,4,B00004W0T9,"This review is for the region 2 PAL DVD.  After reading the complaints about the dubbed US version, I decided to get this version, and am probably better off for it.  The DVD picture and sound are clear; it includes production notes giving some details about the film.
The story is about a teen age girl who checks out the club scene where she can see her idol David Bowie.  She then meets a series of other fans that get her deeper into the drug scene.  Initially, her soon to be boyfriend, Detlev, tries to discourage her from doing heroin, but she insists to satisfy her curiosity and be part of a new scene.  She inevitably becomes addicted and along with Detlev resorts to prostitution to support their habit.  They hang around the seedy Zoo station dealing with clients who pretty much know they are junkies.  They are ashamed of their lives but don't see any alternative.  They try to stop but it isn't easy to kick the habit.
The film captures very well a pervading sense of tragic nihilism that must have been prevalent in Berlin at that time.  ""Yeah, everybody eventually gets hooked on heroin, and so what"".  What a sad commentary on an era.
There are also some funny scenes despite the bleak story,  e.g. Christiane trying to steal a customer from another prostitute, and then getting into a scuffle with her.  In another scene, Christiane and Detlev bicker over each other's selection of customers, as if they have any real option to be more selective.  In addition, there was a scene near beginning that showed some Biker types roughing around in a Bowie concert.  Really, Hells Angels in a Bowie concert?  That's stretching it, and they looked more American than German, but still, that was interesting for the time period.
Anyway, Christiane F is a good substance abuse film and a good time capsule of West Berlin in the 1970's.  These two qualities make the film interesting to watch.",1387756800,,1901,4.663663663663663

1359163,3,B00004W0T9,This movie is dubbed.  I believe it's only available as such and not with subtitles.  It is really hard (for me) to watch a dubbed movie.  I'd prefer to read the subtitles and listen to the movie in it's native language.  It is a difficult story to watch given the subject matter.  The Bowie soundtrack is worth the price of the movie.,1376265600,,335,4.338709677419355
1359164,2,B00004W0T9,"When this movie first came out, it made a real impression on me. I bought it to show to my teenage daughter, and she did not get it at all. I guess I am lucky.",1370476800,,159,3.5714285714285716
1359165,5,B00004W0T9,"Before I get into the review I wanted to mention that I know a great deal about Christiane's life and story. I even managed the Christiane F. Official myspace profile before it was handed over to someone else to manage. Now this film is the most realistic film ever made about Heroin addiction. Christiane F. was filmed on Location in Germany, and many of the locations where the actual events took place were locations where the film was shot. Including of course Berlin's now infamous 'Bahnhof Berlin Zoologischer Garten'(Zoo Station), The place that inspired the first track of U2's Actung Baby album, and the location where Christiane and her friends scored and used heroin. Some of them(including Christiane and her boyfriend, Detlev)walked through the station selling their bodies as prostitutes to support their drug habbit. Christiane F. as a film is masterfully directed by Uli Edel. He spares no detail, and manages to create a grimly depressing, and extremely dark story about the world of Junkies unlike any film ever has before. David Bowie makes an appearance in the film, and compositions from several of his albums are used as the film's soundtrack. This is fitting because Christiane was a massive Bowie fan at the time. By the age of 14 Christiane Felscherinow had already used Marijuana, Speed, LSD, and Heroin. By 15 she was a hooker walking the streets of Berlin. This is truly the utlimate film about Heroin users, and it is a remarkable experience. If you can get past the sort of laughable dubbing you will discover a stark and powerfull film that will stay with you for a while. Natja Brunkhorst was excellent in the part of Christiane, and even looked very similar to the actual Christiane. This is about as realistic and grim as any film about drug users has ever dared to go.",1368144000,5,1803,4.8381877022653725
1359166,5,B00004W0T9,I looked all over the place to find this movie with the original german audio with english subtitles. Finally a dvd that has it! The disc and box came in great condition and it arrived surprisingly fast! This is a must see movie about a young girl's struggle with heroin addiction (based on a true story might I add). It's obviously better than the english dubbed version because the original adds more feeling/emotion to the story. The dvd also being coded for all regions made it all the more better!,1351814400,3,502,4.588888888888889

1359168,4,B00004W0T9,"I read the book first and was pleased that this film did it justice; that so rarely happens.  I saw this movie when it came out on the big screen.  At the time, there really weren't that many true accounts of drug addiction, especially involving people this young, in the mainstream media.  This film caused a sensation in Europe, though it did not garner the same following in North America.  The acting by all of the young stars is very good.  The subject matter is intense and I suspect that in today's politically correct climate, it would be difficult to make this film.  There are scenes of teen prostitution and the film details the first intimate relationship between the two young leads. The film is based on a true story and recounts how Christiane was introduced to drugs at a popular teen nightclub in Berlin.  After some time, she saw that the cool kids were trying heroin, and like so many others, felt that she could handle it.  It wasn't long before she was standing at the Zoo Station, selling her wares.  The lines people are willing to cross once they enter that world always get pushed and this movie shows how Christiane first vomits when engaging in sex for sale and then becomes a ""curb crawler.""  Her mother tries to pull her out, yet there is never an easy cure.  The movie has difficult scenes to watch if one is easily upset (no spoiler-but there's a bit in a toilet stall), yet that's why it works.  It doesn't pander.  Fans of David Bowie will also enjoy the musical score as it features concert footage by him.",1326067200,6,1540,4.516245487364621
1359169,5,B00004W0T9,"The Region 2 dvd is the one to get; uncut, in it's original aspect ratio of 1;66.  And it includes the German audio with English subtitles.  The Region 1 dvd from Image has the stupid english dubbing, and also the german track, but there are no english subtitles for some reason, so unless you speak fluent German, you are out of luck with that one.  The film itself is a classic of drug films and of German cinema.  the only film of this subject that comes close is ""Requiem for a Dream.""",1287014400,6,489,4.282608695652174
1359170,3,B00004W0T9,"this film explores the world of 14 year old Christiane, a bored teen who is introduced to heroin through her boyfriend.  Soon heroin takes over her life.  The film's style is very straight-forward, without being melodramatic; almost like a documentary.

As the addiction takes over, we see the negative changes in her behavior and personality.  A powerful film.

I found the film, however, too long; it clocks in at 2 hours, and 10 minutes.  The editor could have sliced off about 20 minutes (at various points in the film) to make a ""tighter"" film...this is why I gave 3 stars instead of 4.",1244851200,,591,4.689320388349515
1359171,5,B00004W0T9,"It amazes me that this film isn't more widely known. It's nothing short of perfection--stellar acting, a brilliant ""Berlin Era"" soundtrack by David Bowie & gritty cinematography that perfectly captures the subject, the city and the time period.  With the exception of a couple of Fassbinder films, no other film captures the aesthetic and essence of 1970s Berlin better.

This is also one of the most honest portrayals of drug abuse that I've ever seen put to celluloid.  The director doesn't shy away from or attempt to glamorize the horrors of heroin withdrawal and addiction (and all the ugly things that come along with it), but he also doesn't demonize all drugs or the atmosphere of teenage hedonism that leads to drug experimentation either.  It's a very even-handed, honest film, which not many ""drug films"" are.

Amazing film; definitely check this one out.",1241136000,2,866,5.027972027972028
1359172,2,B00004W0T9,"This movie depicts the ease with which so many people have fallen prey to heroin.

1359174,5,B00004W0T9,"A cautionary tale for today's teen who gets bored by everything after 2 minutes.  You know what they say about the idle mind.

I saw this movie as a teen.  Some older high school kids thought it had some shock value so they invited us with the bait of David Bowie in the movie and soundtrack.  The in your face depravity created a boundary for me that my grandmother's prayers and words of wisdom never could.  I still went off full throttle off into the world a young adult, full of music, art, travel, joie de vivre, but this movie stayed as a dark warning in the back of my mind.

I'm in agreement with one reviewer who stated that a major message in this movie is that the adults were not keeping an eye on their kids.  Everyone was caught up in their own ""distractions""; very much like today's warped world of iPods, cell phones, internet, reality TV, etc.  This makes adults (and especially children's) minds, bodies and souls easy picking's for predators of all forms and levels of finesse.

There's a lot to be said for ""quiet time"" with someone close, or pet.  The happiness of just being alone somewhere appreciating nature in all it's glory.  A movie like Chritiane F will make you be satisfied with the simple things in life.

Those of us who have survived our own youth can sit back from a movie like this and say to ourselves: ""There, but for the grace of God....""",1215820800,9,1378,4.424603174603175

1359177,3,B00004W0T9,"The good: the movie itself.  Dark, depressing, gripping and well-done movie about teenage heroin addicts in late-'70s Berlin, based on the autobiography of the real-life Christiane F.  Amazing performances from a cast that, believe it or not, were mostly non-actors, and a truly magnificent job of showing the horrors of addiction.  Not to mention it's a priceless time capsule and period piece of Berlin during that time.

The bad: the DVD release, at least the Region 1 American version.  A previous reviewer was on the mark in calling this ""bare-bones.""  No director commentary, no special features, no updates on where the cast and/or the real-life people this film is based on are now, and not even subtitles.  There is literally NOTHING on this DVD except for the original movie itself in German and an option to watch it in a truly awful English-language dub.  If the dubbed English dialogue was the actual dialogue of a film, that film would rank up there with ""From Justin to Kelly"" or Vanilla Ice's ""Cool as Ice"" as one of the most moronic films of all time.

5 stars for the movie, 1 star for the DVD, for an average of 3 stars total.",1170115200,9,1145,4.685
1359178,4,B00004W0T9,"It's surprising to me that more American cinema buffs have not seen ""Christiane F."". Directed by noted auteur Uli Edel who went on to direct the simarilarily themed ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"", ""Christiane F"" brings the working class teen world of 1970's Berlin vividly to life.

Following the book ""Christiane F"" very closely, the film shows us the downward spiral of a 13 year old heroin addict played by Nadja Brunckhorst. The young actress does a wonderful job, physically deteriorating through out the story. She's in every single scene in the movie, and it's quite surprising that such a young actress who could carry an entire film did so little work in her later career.

David Bowie's music is used to wonderful effect to underscore the hopelessness of these young junkies lives. His late 70's instrumental works with Brian Eno add greatly to the emotional impact of ""Christiane F"". Only the concert scene where Bowie performs ""Station to Station"" appears slightly gratuitous; at least, Christiane making direct eye contact with Bowie is a bit out of place in this otherwise uber-realistic film.

The scenes of shooting up in filthy subway bathrooms will probably make many viewers uncomfortable with their uncompromising realism. So too, the graphic depictions of young teens selling themselves for sex to desperately lonely middle-aged Berliners. The withdrawal scene when Detlef & Christiane try to kick heroin together is a brutal sequence, but absolutely realistic.

If a film such as ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" is your cup of tea, you shouldn't miss ""Christiane F."" If graphic depictions of shooting up heroin make you squeamish, you may want to give this film a miss; it will be your loss however, because this film is a gem that any true cinemiste should see.",1134172800,15,1769,5.027303754266212
1359179,5,B00004W0T9,"This movie was so great, aside from the Pippi Longstocking-esque over dubbing.  The movie is in German so they have this emotionless woman translating.

I thought it was more of a documentary before I watched it.  Normally in a situation like this I would be disappointed to see that it's an actual drama, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The scenes were so realistic and you really got a feel for how it must have been in Berlin in the late 70's drug scene.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

I can't wait to get the book!",1131840000,4,523,4.4526315789473685
1359180,4,B00004W0T9,"I saw this movie when I was 15 and I credit it as the sole reason I avoided hard drugs.  Like any teenager, I was curious about drugs, but after seeing this film, I swore I never wanted that pathetic lifestyle.  How happy I was to see that it was in DVD format and I could watch it again. The movie still brought back all the feelings that it did then - shock, tension, sadness, etc. - but I really, really wish that it had subtitles. The dubbing was horrible and it really does take away from the emotion of the film.  I'd still recommend it to others - but I hope that they release a version with subtitles instead.  That is my only complaint.

The actors are amazing - it is hard to believe that some of them were not professionals.  The script is based on the real life exploits of a young heroin addict and her friends in 1970's Berlin.  Expect to see the usual overdosing, drama, prostitution, dishonesty and death that you see in other drug films such as ""Requiem For A Dream"".  But what makes this one different is the feeling of the relationships that people form when on drugs.  It felt very real and not phony at all.

The scene where the junkie jumps down into the toilet and steals Christiane's drug-filled needle, then shoots himself up in the neck is truly creepy.

Apparently, years later, the real Christiane struggled with drugs again but has now found happiness as a single parent.",1124064000,12,1400,4.408560311284047
1359181,5,B00004W0T9,"I hadn't seen Christiane F. for about the last 12 years until Monday just gone when I saw it and hired it from the video store. It was a film that I had always remembered the video cover and bits of the movie, like when they are running through the mall to David Bowie's Heroes(that has been my favourite Bowie song since I saw this film). This film like many for years has always been in the back of my brain, until I saw it to buy once in the city, when I went to purchase it it was gone, until now.

From  reuniting with this film after years, it has left a lasting impression om me. Like Christiane I am a big fan of Bowie and in 2003, saw him in concert, which was an cool and an experience I didn't think I'd get to have.

I definitly recommend this film, and it's a really good film even though it's in subtitles I quite enjoyed that aspect of it, there's a little charm to it amonsth the drug use and addiction. I read that these actors were ametures, well I was definitely impressed.",1112918400,5,992,4.103092783505154

1359184,4,B00004W0T9,"...as any good movie that explores the world of drug addiction should be.  Quite graphic in its depiction of the consequences of drug addiction, and the heartbreaking, and seemingly unbreakable, bonds involved.  Just when you think someone is about to break free, they get sucked back in.  Very sad, and frustrating.
About as searingly graphic, if not more, as ""Requiem for a Dream"", another excellent movie that should convince anyone who watches it to avoid the scourge that is drugs.  Another movie you wouldn't want to watch too frequently, due to its gruesome honesty and the fact that the images are burned into your brain.
Excellent soundtrack from David Bowie, including live concert footage.  Most of the songs are from his ""Heroes"" album, which was written and recorded in West Berlin, and conveys the feelings that living in West Berlin evoked in Bowie.  Ideal soundtrack then for Christiane F, being set in West Berlin.",1075420800,5,931,5.012987012987013
1359185,5,B00004W0T9,"I agree with the previous reviewers that the stark, realistic depiction of drug use is a powerful aspect of Christiane F., but there is so much more that makes the movie outstanding. It brought tears to my eyes the first time I watched it because of the way it portrays a young person's search for love, for acceptance, to find meaning. To me this movie drives home the frailty as well as the value of life.
More specifically, the movie works because it shows a variety of human emotions: Christiane's anger at her mother; her boredom in the grey concrete world of West-Berlin; her tender love for Detlef and pure desperation in the end. We really get a glimpse of her world and why she gets into drugs, even though everybody warns her about it. It's not simple peer pressure, but her own desparate need to belong and her compassion with Detlef that drives Christiane. Despite its length (130 min.) and the limited number of locations, the movie keeps you glued to the screen because it relies on competent, subtle acting rather than beating the viewer over the head with fake ""dramatic"" scenes. In contrast to most movies today, music is used rather sporadically, yet all the more effectively. My favorite scene is in the beginning when the youth gang runs through an empty mall, while we hear David Bowie's ""Heroes"" in full blast. I couldn't convey more effectively the sheer enthusiasm of being young and alive. Director Uli Edel (whose oevre includes other highs such as Last Exit to Brooklyn and lows as Body of Evidence; he also directed one Twin Peaks episode) effectively switches between fast and slow motion, dialog and image driven scenes. This is the perfect example of a well-paced movie.
Even to those English speakers whose Highschool German has become rusty, this is well-worth the effort of finding it. Once you got the gist of the story in the dubbed version, listen to the sheer emotion in the original voices. Christiane F. is one of those rare movies that haunt you long after watching it.",1073174400,5,2010,4.7457142857142856
1359186,5,B00004W0T9,"This is a movie that is incredibly powerful. I read the book in English many years ago, and it was enough to put a serious scare into me. Never touched drugs as a result of that book. When I moved to Berlin in 1987, I read the book again, this time in German (the English translation is pretty mediocre in retrospect) - the impact was brutal. I made a point of visiting the actual locations in the story, and this has made the entire story more indelible.
Now to the movie (this refers to the Region 2 German release). Although it does not follow the book faithfully in every detail, enough of the events are depicted to tell the full story. It is difficult to imagine being desperate enough to sink to such levels, but this film manages to convey it in such a way, that it is all too real. The young actors especially do an amazing job (and for you German-speakers, the accents, dialects and slang are right on!).
The bottom line is that this is a film that you will never forget.",1062720000,3,981,4.308108108108108

1359188,3,B00004W0T9,"If you are interested in the substance abuse genre, this movie is the most realistic, powerful, and disturbing I've seen.  Compare this to the likes of ""Days of Wine and Roses"", ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" and ""28 Days"", and the others all seem lame and glossed over.  The only film that I thought came close to the level of realism of ""Chrstiane F."" was ""Panic in Needle Park"".
This film takes you to the horrifying depths of heroin addiction, as excruciatingly experienced by a German teenager and her ""friends"".  Based on a true story from the 1970's Berlin drug scene, the title character is from a dysfuntional family who eventually falls into the grips of heroin addiction and prostitution by age 14.  Great soundtrack, with Bowie (I especially liked the version of Heroes that is sung partly in German), great depiction of the 70's club scene in Berlin, which was rampant with drug use.  Even though in color, has the gritty feel of a noir.  The film also captures dead-on the desperation of addiction, and how the addicts life becomes all about the next shot.  The film also does a great job of conveying the depravity and desolation of the Berlin Zoo train station, a haven for prostitues and addicts at the time.
Based on a book of the same name (unfortunately, last I checked, the book was out of print), the movie of course does not go into as much detail (what movie based on a book does?) but nonetheless, this is a brutal, accurate portrait of the ravages of drug use.
Two things, if you can find the book, buy it.  The book was riveting and goes into much greater depth of the girls family background, and her early drug use pre-heroin addiction.  Also the movie condenses her many ""cold turkey"" episodes into one or two instances, and the true horror of her withdrawals are much more graphic and real in the book.
Secondly, I would have given this 5 stars if the movie were subtitled instead of dubbed.  It takes a lot away from the film, and I would recommend waiting until it is released (hopefully) in German with subtitles.  I was fortunate enough to have seen the film in the theatre in German with subtitles, and it made a big difference.
A classic movie of this genre, a must see, even with the dubbing!",1039910400,27,2229,4.5475

Christiane F. definitely deglamourizes the drug image, showing the character's standards lower throughout the picture. First the girl makes a point of saying she would never try drugs. Not only does she do so in a few days but the following year she is addicted to heroin. But I found it amusing that she went to prostitution before she went so low as to sell her David Bowie albums on the street. (Bowie is the Elvis of Glam Rock. His soundtrack definitely works with this movie.)
Yes the dubbing is awful but even the viewer forgets this after a while as you're caught up in the picture.",1038441600,13,780,4.578571428571428

Ulrich Edel, I've known his name for some time from his work like <LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN> <BODY OF EVIDENCE> but this is the first film that he made in his country Germany and it is nothing like he made in hollywood.
It is so detailed, so precise and so perfect.

The story itself was a sensitive subject and the director never show the main charactor being totally naked to make sure that the audience will not feel like they are enjoying the movie.
The movie is about a 14 year old girl who becomes a heroine addict and ends up with doing anything to have the drug incude hustling.
She happens to meet a boy and they becomes a boyfriend girlfriend. But sadly they both are addict.
They tell each other, they will be sober tomorrow. The only thing is there was no tomorrow.
They are just getting worse.
Yes, they tried to quite and they succeded to do so. But then they did it again.
That's the nature of being addicted.
As seeing the whole enviornmnet in Germany back in 70s, you will feel how bad the situation then.
There's people-mostly young ones- who are heroine addict- everywhere.
The street is all so gloomy and the city is dead.
There must have tones of people who had no jiob back then.
It was a bad times.
People had no idea about drugs. health. They just wanted to enjoy their moment.

This girl Natja Brunckhorst just wanted to feel what her boyfriend feels. That's all.
But the boyfriend didn't wanted her to feel that since he knew how bad that is. He was kind of a good boy.
He even waited her till she was ready. He didn't made love to her even he had many chances.
They could have been a nice couple.

But the drug ruined them all.
Their future, their life and their health and mind.
They cannot think straight.
The boy even stayed with this old foreign guy and became his sex slave. He said he needed money for the drugs.
Even the girl moved in to that guy's house too. What a bommer.
When she finally sees the boufriend having sex (if it was sex), she left the house.

The story is based on a record of a girl which portrays the 70s of Germany, the real gloomybad times.

The movie ends with the narration that the girl saying she was finally saved luckily by her mother and went to the countryside but she don't know how her boyfriend ended up with.

It was quite happy knowing that the director finally went back to Germany and made another great film <Der Baader Meinhof Komplex> in 2008.
He kind of trapped in Hollywood and made not so good films like <LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN> AND EVEN WORST <BODY OF EVIDENCE>.",1465344000,,2591,4.331958762886598

Therefore the DVD was not sitting secured in the case. During the transport the DVD was moving freely in the case in the broken central clasp which was supposed to hold the DVD secured, scratched the surface of the DVD severely.
