6854649,5,B00Q5J9TM0,"As a movie, & a L.BEESON Fan, excellent A Cult movie classic for me. He takes a superb character like LEON, Fron his also excellent movie LA FEMME NIKITA. And tells us this wonderful story of the Assassin.  Also one of the performances that absolutely stand out is that of Gary Oldman You gotta love him & a young N. Portman. If you have not seen this movie do so, if you have not got this in your Collection it's gotta be there!.Now as a guy that has a diploma in fine arts, the idea of releasing these movies in POP ART form is wonderful.  This is a steelbook I would highly recommend.  It has the theatre release & the Uncut.  Nuff said,  Enjoy",1423094400,6,647,4.185483870967742

8690435,5,B00Q5J9TM0,"Leon the Professional is an excellent movie, as originally shown in the U.S. However, in viewing this U.S.- cut movie multiple times, I was not aware that an extended International version was available. This extended version, with considerable additional scenes, is provided in this SteelBook Blu-Ray release. The additional scenes provide enhanced depth and greater understanding of the relationship between Leon and Natalie Portman's character. I was not troubled by the subtle sexual undertones, as greater understanding of their love-relationship brought greater clarity and understanding for the movie and the characters portrayed. And, what can I say, Gary Oldman's performance as a drug-crazed, dangerous and volatile DEA agent must be seen to be believed. He is a genius. This is truly an excellent movie, well worth viewing repeatedly.",1478390400,5,845,5.609375

8690443,5,B00Q5J9TM0,"This Movie: The film, of course, is powerful. The acting, cinematography, and score are incredibly unique and incredibly memorable. I had watched the film once before and was so affected that I knew I needed to buy it. It was enough for a teen like me to spend what little money he has on the purchase. I watched this and introduced it to a friend. One of their family members were mad that we watched it without letting them know so that they could watch it with us. It's that good. Absolutely in my top five movies. Watch it with an open mind, but, don't be surprised when you're impressed.

This Package: The steelbook is just as cool as it appears. I'm very glad to have secured my own copy. The video quality is fantastic and clear. A note: the title on the top is just part of the packaging, no words appear on the case at all. Completely satisfied.",1427500800,7,855,4.34375
