8702352,5,B000HEVATO,"A modern descendant of Dracula lives in an old house near a cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, NY.  DRACULA III and his three brides do not kill the prey they drink from.  However, another female vampire, so evil and cruel, is ruining Drac III's reputation.  As a result, two female FBI agents harass the poor plump, bald and blue-faced ""innocent,"" Drac III.  Just when things look bleakest gentle Drac falls in love with the lovely young attorney who tries to protect him from the aggressive agents.

Why give this super-low budget production FIVE STARS?  After all, the movie is often quite silly, but it grew on me.  I found myself laughing suddenly even though I did not intend to like the movie at all.  Finally, I gave in to the simple, sick charm of NOSFERATU'S CRUSH.  The girls were beautiful, the acting was funny and cute even though overdone at times.  And the stupidity of the female lawyer's boyfriend never achieved even a two-digit IQ.

Of course Drac III's ancestor, the original Vlad Dracula, lived all of ""two hundred"" years ago--or so the characters in this film keep saying.  Any vampire fan can tell you Vlad lived a lot longer than 200 years ago.  The FBI vixens are also rather good at comedy and provide some hilarious diatribes against the evil of vampires.

The contrast between the idealistic attorney and the lustful, slavering, ass-worshipping, pointy-eared DRAC III made for some precious scenes in this ribald comic vamp flick.",1356912000,,1451,4.821862348178137
8702353,3,B000HEVATO,"I bought this film not knowing what to expect. It wasn't too expensive at the time and I love vampire films

The film synopsis is so complex I'm not even going to bother trying to explain it. I'm still left a bit confused by the ending and what actually happened in the movie. Yet I gave it three stars due to the effort made within this film. The nosferatu character was fun to watch. The girls were gorgeous. The comedy was there and was pretty good. Camera quality wasn't too bad although you felt as though the cameraman had take the day off and left the new guy in charge

I just wish they had done more with the characters at their disposal. None of the vampire victims seemed to turn and they had a cast of nice looking women who delivered their dialogue well but seemed disappointed by the quality of the film they were in

It is worth a watch if you are a vampire fan like me, but don't go out of your way to see it - there are films like this on youtube",1241136000,,963,4.111702127659575
