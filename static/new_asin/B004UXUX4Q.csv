4471718,5,B004UXUX4Q,"Simply put: this is a superb film.

Begin with a great story and excellent scenery.  Throw in outstanding performances by George Clooney and a very talented, and well selected, supporting cast, and you have a great, great film.

Clooney continues to gain just a huge amount of respect in my eyes and is becoming one of my favorite actors to watch on the big screen.  His knack for picking great stories to star in adds to this respect and his judgement as a true Hollywood professional.

That said, the real gem of this film is Shailene Woodley and how well she plays the smart, razor-sharp, yet classy Alexandra King.  Ms. Woodley is going to be a huge star in the coming years--no doubt about that.  And if her performance in The Descendants is any indicator of what is to come from her, she is an easy bet for an Oscar down the line.

The plot of the film is refreshingly clear and gripping and will pull the heart strings of even the toughest movie goer.

I highly recommend this film.  Five Stars (without even the slightest reservation).",1322092800,6,1043,4.529411764705882
4471719,5,B004UXUX4Q,"What a great role for Clooney. His character is a wealthy Hawaiian lawyer who has just learned that his comatose wife's condition after a boating accident is not improving and they may have to pull the plug. His daughters--one 10, the other 17--are acting out in ways he hasn't a clue how to handle. He holds the reins of a family trust that owns a huge chunk of scenic land and the cousins are queuing up on both sides of the question of whether he should sell and make them all rich or hold on to it. Now his teenage daughter tells him she's seen evidence that she thinks indicates Mom had been cheating on him. Here's a man who's never met a situation he couldn't handle with ease. Now his life is threatening to come undone from every direction. Yet you know he's going to somehow figure out a way to handle all this. What you may not be expecting under the circumstances is just how very funny much of that will turn out to be.

Add to all of the above a perfectly cast supporting cast. The kids who play his kids are required to play almost as wide a range of emotion as Clooney is and they play it with an ease and naturalness that is as believable as his. The young actor who plays the teenage daughter's dorky hang-around boyfriend provides delicious comic relief just when it's needed. The actors who play the grandparents are superb in small but important roles. Beau Bridges gets only a tiny bit of screen time as one of the cousins, but he makes the most of it. And then there's the marvelous Judy Greer. I've long loved her work in ditsy comic sidekick roles, but here she leaves the funny business to others and plays a serious role beautifully--both the quiet warmth and the heartbreaking bravado. And let us not forget the actress playing the comatose wife...that role couldn't have been easy either. Very highly recommended.",1321920000,,1842,4.482142857142857
4471720,5,B004UXUX4Q,"I remember about seven years ago when video rental stores were still in their prime and I frequented Hollywood Video instead of Netflix when I picked up Sideways on a whim, brought it home, and thoroughly enjoyed it but never really had the chance to talk to anybody about it. It was long before I started reviewing movies and most of my friends have the typical guy taste in movies: if there isn't a ton of nudity, blood and violence, or explosion of some kind in the first ten minutes then they essentially get bored with it and fall asleep or turn it off without giving it a proper chance. So I kind of felt like I was this closet Sideways fan for years. Up until The Descendants, it was actually the only Alexander Payne directed film I've had the chance to see as well. With that said, I'm also not the biggest George Clooney fan. His pretentiousness in real life seems to have crossed over into many of his performances and my favorite memories from his acting resume are mostly Seth Gecko from From Dusk 'Till Dawn and Sparky and Dr. Gouache from ""South Park"". There have obviously been better movies of his since then (O Brother, Where Art Thou? Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Up In the Air, and Fantastic Mr. Fox are personal favorites), but none have spoken to me the way Seth Gecko did. There has already been quite a lot of Academy Award talk with The Descendants, but Clooney's roles always seem to be associated with The Oscars so that wasn't too surprising. However The Descendants proved to not only be one of Clooney's best on-screen performances but is also one of the best 2011 has to offer.

Visually speaking, The Descendants is extraordinary. It's filmed in Hawaii after all, so it's kind of difficult to make it look bad. The scenery is almost overly-beautiful even though much of the film is overcast Hawaii's green landscapes and clear ocean water makes nearly every scene visually striking. Even when it's raining you can't help but feel the urge to visit this amazing place or return there if you've been fortunate enough to have gone to Hawaii before. There's also a staircase scene where we're looking down at Clooney while he's climbing stairs that caught my eye while he narrates about his life which mostly revolves around trying to fix a broken marriage. It sounds so simple on paper, but it's one of those scenes where the camera was in the right place at the right time and makes something so brief memorable.

This is easily the most emotional George Clooney has ever been in one of his performances, as well. He's on the brink of a breakdown the entire film and while I would've liked to have seen something a bit more expressive especially after the hype for ""his first on-screen breakdown,"" what we do receive is still really emotional and heartfelt. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are also fantastic as Matt King's (Clooney) children. They provide many of the laughs a good portion of the film and show they're also fully capable of displaying what feels like sincere sorrow and emotion. That's one of the best things about The Descendants; it provides plenty of hilarious laugh-out-loud moments but also isn't afraid to show you more tender moments that tug at your heartstrings. Alexandra's (Woodley) friend Sid (Nick Krause) is very entertaining, as well. His scenes in the car and at Elizabeth's (Patricia Hastie) parents' house are some of the greatest the film has to offer. Matt's friends Mark (Rob Huebel) and Kai Mitchell (Mary Birdsong) are also a highlight. Mark provides some really hilarious one-liners while Kai is obviously a very devoted friend to Matt's wife Elizabeth.

There are little to no faults to be found in the film. The entire cast delivers, the story unravels in a very pleasing fashion, and the film is magnificently shot. There's very little to be unhappy with. Even the Hawaiian music was a high spot. While I'm not the biggest fan of foreign music, this was generally very soothing featuring Hawaiian lyrics accompanied by guitar or ukulele plucking. The one thing that might come off as kind of silly is the Matthew Lillard kitchen scene being fairly reminiscent of the ending to Scream, but that was more humorous than anything.

I'm sure it differentiates a bit from critic to critic, but for me the best movies are not only the ones that feature talented casts, engrossing storytelling, and solid scripts but are also the ones that manage to affect a wide range of your emotions. The Descendants does all of that and then some. Every performance feels genuine and the never-ending downward spiral feeling the story gives you is resolved in a way that not only feels natural but is completely satisfying. This is George Clooney at his absolute best and it's safe to say that Alexander Payne has outdone himself. The Descendants is chaotic, charming, hilarious, and emotional. It's quite possibly the most powerful and emotion-evoking film of the year.",1321574400,10,4931,4.77725674091442

4471825,5,B004UXUX4Q,"Excellent screenplay of story by Kaui Hart Hemmings that sensitively examines the dynamics of relationships from multiple perspectives: marriage, parenthood, friendships,and broader familial obligations, while also probing the impacts and values of modernization and work, relative to traditional lifestyles and environmental stewardship.  The performances are all top notch-- this is one of my favorite performances by Clooney, but all the supporting roles are spot on, with shout-outs to Woodley (older daughter), Krause (daughter's friend), and Bridges (cousin) especially. Alexander Payne's direction, as in Sideways, proceeds at a pace that enlarges the emotional space allowing us to become more involved with the characters.  With an exceptional soundtrack (that is an awesome sampling of traditional Hawaiian music), and the beauty of Hawaii as a backdrop, this is worth watching and re-watching (I've seen it about 5 times over the years).",1508025600,2,948,5.86231884057971

I'm thinking that Nat Faxon and Jim Rash push this movie to better heights than what could have been accomplished alone by Payne. I say this because of their overlooked masterpiece ""The way, way back."" Touching and hilarious. And that's what the descendants does so effortlessly. Payne is more than capable of pulling that off alone; he's done it before. There's just something special and different about the descendants. There's a great special feature on the blu ray that explains a lot about what makes this movie feel special, but Rash and Faxon are not mentioned. However, this movie without a doubt would not be the same without their academy award winning work on the script.",1506729600,,773,4.946153846153846

This quiet film is beautifully acted, effectively portraying the confusion that can result from conflicting emotions.  At a time when he needs peace and support to help him prepare for the death of his wife, Matt is also exposed to betrayal and the stress of an impending land deal that places the hopes and aspirations of his entire extended family on his shoulders.  Clooney shows us a man who is stunned, angry, and guilty as he tries to readjust to his new reality.  The film is full of specific detail that makes us feel that we are watching real lives.  The subplot concerning the land deal never really meshed with the rest of the film, causing a key scene near the end to strike a false note, but it's not enough to derail the film.",1482883200,,919,4.648148148148148

The story of the movie was good and captured my interest, however, the movie itself was mediocre. For all the hype, it could have been a little bit better.

4472082,5,B004UXUX4Q,"I have a strange allergy to anything having to do with George Clooney but with the Oscar buzz I was curious.

I loved it. I loved the process the Clooney character goes through as he learns a lot more about his wife than he wanted to know. I loved some very prickly and honest monologues he delivers at her bedside. And his relationships with his kids. (Teach your parents well...) It's interesting to see the lights in his internal life come on (in relationship to almost everything going on in his life) at the same time his wife's lights are going out.

He was a victim of cliche that you can never truly know someone. He learns his wife's secret and that starts his journey of discovery and in the end he learns about himself.

The movie has warmth and sees it's characters through a very human lens.

No one gets life, love or relationships right. All you can do is calibrate your compass and keep trying.",1466380800,9,910,4.431137724550898

4472086,5,B004UXUX4Q,"This is a just right movie. It's sentimental without being cloying. The primary roles are very wisely cast. Direction, filming, editing are expertly refined. There's a great feel of place ( Hawaii) through music, scenery.  Exceptionally adept and seamless are the transitions from scene to scene. But the real treat is Clooney - Clooney running with some urgency from place to place with just the right degree of unesthetic and clumsy and so memorably, with an added feel of wearing the wrong shoes, that he does for running what Charlie Chaplin did for walking. His nuanced expressions ( must be more of that Alexander Payne direction) subtly going from nodding in agreement to approaching panic is so authentic. The story line is very human, weighty and real enough with the right amount of levity. So what I'm saying is there's so much brainy and pleasing detail to this film, it's a bit like standing before a successful piece of art and feeling both excited and grateful.",1465689600,,976,4.879518072289157
4472087,2,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants is a fictional story of the descendants of Liliuokalani, the last queen of Hawai'i. They have a piece of land left and have to figure out if they'll keep it or if they'll sell it to hotels. This is the backstory for George Clooney's character Matt King. Matt has a dysfunctional family who has just experienced tragedy, and he now not only has to learn to care for his family, but also figure out what to do with the land. While this movie had some funny lines, it was filled with white washing. George Clooney is the most native looking person and he is just slightly tan. Clooney's character had a bunch of cousins all of which were white, regardless that they are supposed to be the descendants of Hawai'ian royalty. In fact, almost all of the characters in this movie are white. There are a select few Hawai'ian people: whose jobs in the movie are either to look very peaceful or one woman who is meant to symbolize the entire island being upset over the potential new hotel. The only reason the movie is getting two stars instead of one, is story wise it was decent, it's just sad that Hollywood took a native Hawai'ian woman's book and turned it white.",1465084800,,1174,4.490654205607477
4472108,5,B004UXUX4Q,"Loved this movie. First because it is set in Hawaii. It was enjoyable to recognize the settings.

4472191,3,B004UXUX4Q,"Good movie but I was hoping to learn more of the Hawaiian history of this story.  As it is it mostly deals with with personal issues between the man, his daughters, and his (on life support) wife.  It does not get into the background of the story pertaining to his Hawaiian heritage and the land he controls through his trust passed down through the generations--and it is a big part of the story and partly what tales him on his journey in the movie. I also take issue with the fact that in the movie, towards the end, Clooney's character refers to himself and their family as ""haole as s***'.  As a direct descendant of Hawaiian royalty he is no more Haole than the ""Hawaiian"" with Japanese (Filipino, Samoan, Mexican, etc) blood.  Originally 'haole' meant ""one with no land"" (foreigner), not the ""white"" person that many believe it refers to today.  Clooney's character and his family (with royal Hawaiian ancestry) is as native as they come, regardless of how ""haole"" they look.",1457913600,,982,4.686046511627907

It is about two crises which occur in the same time period and cause a dysfunctional family to examine both their beliefs and behaviors. I find some parts a bit confused and things may fall together too easily at times but the framework of the father as narrator works overall. Mostly I love seeing the beauty of Hawaii, especially Kauai, and feel an even stronger stand on people's responsibility to the land and the trust we have to care for it, despite the messes we make of our personal relationships and ensuing problems could be discussed. I felt a bit that the ending was a little weak, as if someone looked at the clock and said that they need to wrap it up to make it movie length.

The bratty spoiled daughter character was unbearable. Do people actually raise their children that badly?

Movies and shows about useless and pathetic rich people do cheer up the unwashed masses however, as we have the pleasure of knowing they will be the first to go in the post apocalyptic world.

In my opinion Payne's greatest strength is to lend humanity to people I would not want in my home. There is nothing sympathetic about the characters in this movie, with the possible exception of the youngest child and grandmother.

Still, I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to anyone whose life has had what - in the first world - passes for tragedy. Few have similar resources backing us in times of trouble. Fewer would follow the path this movie takes to manage the tragedy.

4472503,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendents
 A better made, acted and written film with like intensity I have not seen this year.  I hope not to see its like anytime soon.  Stupid humans-this is an incredible film which deals with the tragic death of a loved one, not so fun.  Throw in a drug troubled teen ager, adultery by a family man, cheating spouse and a background of titanic greed vs. our better instincts and there we are.  If grand literature can successfully come to the silver screen to mangle our emotions, this is the very one to do it.  I became disturbed, appalled, sickened and at last brought to pity and a kind of peace through endurance.
 The story revolves around an extended family, the fictitious Kings.  They are loosely-I hope very loosely-modeled on the real life Robinson family.  The Kings, like the Robinsons, own a massive chunk of the Island of Kauai, the Hawaiian Garden Isle.  An old trust which has preserved the land in a pristine state will expire in seven years.  The family must find something to do with the land.  Some want to sell out for $300 million, the others to another bidder for a cool half billion.  Nice choice to have.
 The real story is that of the familial inner action.  We never hear Mrs. King speak.  As the movie opens, she is rendered comatose in a boating accident.  She surely will die, and soon.  Matt King (George Clooney in an Oscar nominated role-which he rightly deserves to win.  We knew he could act but this role is clear off the charts)  must deal with two daughters, one a seventeen year old drug damaged wild child (Shailene Woodley, beautiful, profane and shattered by life) and the other a bewildered middle schooler.
 Woodley in particular is quite good.  She is only 20 but has some 33 TV or film roles to her credit.  Also putting in admirable work are Matthew Lillard and Judy Greer as the philandering Brian Speer and his I never saw it coming wife.
 Great accolades must be reserved for Alexander Payne.  He directed this wonderful, hard to take movie, as he did About Schmidt and Sideways.  He also wrote the script as he also did for the above mentioned along with I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.  He also produced the film.  He must take the lions share of credit.  He will take home the Oscar for Best Picture (as producer) and Best Director, should the Motion Picture Academy so vote.  I would be happy if he wins both, and happy with Clooney for best actor.  This is a very rare five saw blade movie but it is rated R because it deals with the most intense of human emotions in a brilliantly realistic way.  I left drained.
 The film runs a typical one hour and 55 minutes.  I love Hawaii and the film I loved seeing it filmed so vividly and well.  Tiny things that I noticed, like the correct style of Aloha shirt to wear to a business meeting, like the proper high school for prominent Hawaiian families (fabled Punahou, the high school of one Berry Obama) make the movie even better.  Both of these items were simply part of the background, a background developed by very careful movie making.
 As producer, Payne will be happy about the $228 and counting that has crossed the ticket counter so far.  This is a classic, maybe even perfect, film.",1436745600,4,3210,4.518260869565218

4472590,5,B004UXUX4Q,"George Clooney gave one of his best performances as a man who redeems his life and reconnects with his children after his wife in seriously injured in a boating accident.  Indeed, ""The Descendants"" is, in my opinion, centered on the redemption of Clooney's character, the leader of a large clan of native and mixed Hawaiians, who has to a large degree been an absentee father and husband, and the growing up of his teenage daughter. A powerful, yet subtle, celebration of a person who is a basically a good human being, and of his not taking revenge on the people who had wronged him. Instead his enemies (the man with whom his wife was having an affair, his father-in-law, and the man who was driving the speed boat when she had her accident) for the most part punish themselves by their own personal actions.

I recommend this to all who believe that humans can aspire to being good in an imperfect world.",1428969600,,907,4.592592592592593

4472617,5,B004UXUX4Q,"Boy, this movie has a lot going on. on one hand there is a slow undercurrent of the slackness of people who don't seem to have anything better to do. in parallel, is the portrayal of family and acquaintances dealing with some turbulent events in their lives. Their portrayals show how they did face up to some of their issues and leaves you with the impression that this ""reset"" on their lives will actually have them living more fulfilled and happier lives. also, the implication is the lives that they would be living were different then they would have thought before the mother was hurt in the accident.

4472642,4,B004UXUX4Q,"After recently seeing a trailer for this movie and saying, ""Look! Shailene Woodley! George Clooney! Beau Bridges!"", I borrowed ""The Descendants"" from my local library.

Overall, I really enjoyed the story ""The Descendants"" told, and it was sweet to see Clooney's character learn to relate with his daughters, as he had never before been very involved in their lives. It was also beautiful to see Woodley's character mature and really come into her own.

Do be aware, though, that ""The Descendants"" is R for language, so it probably isn't what you want to gather your children to watch with you. But if you love Shailene Woodley, you will love ""The Descendants"", as she shines, giving one of the best performances I've seen!",1426982400,,723,4.918032786885246

4472646,4,B004UXUX4Q,"Clooney is terrific in this, as a dad and husband who's only just beginning to realize the significance of both roles, and the ways he's never really given adequate attention to either.  We find out early that it's too late for one, not quite too late for the other.  The writing, by the man who brought us ""Sideways"" and ""About Schmidt"" is solid, and in some ways there is at least a *bit* of thematic similarity to both films. (Men in search of themselves.)  Too many films have ""throw-away"" characters that are only there to set the stage for what we know about the main actors/actresses.  Not so in this one.  So many of the other players here are really intriguing.  You end up wondering/caring/empathetic with all of them, from his daughters and their issues, to his father-in-law, his oldest daughter's boyfriend, and even some of Matt's relatives (""the descendants""), including cousin Beau Bridges who's only on screen for maybe 10 minutes, if that.  Don't misunderstand, this isn't really what you would call an ensemble cast, it's clearly about George's character, Matt King.  It's HIS story. And a good one, well-told at that.  Four stars because the pacing felt (to me) just a bit contrived or clunky at times.  But a really enjoyable movie.  George needs to make more films with meaty dramatic roles.",1426550400,6,1313,4.816964285714286

The Descendants is a heartfelt movie all the way; not a tearjerker, but a story where I felt well-invested in every character. Family and environment are the two most important elements of this film and without one the other cannot prosper. George gives us a top-notch performance (his best roles are where he doesn't have full control.)

My hat is off to the director, and to George Clooney, whose performance knocked my socks off.  The two daughters are both marvelous.

There really aren't very many movies that capture the Hawaiian lifestyle and attitude that Alexander Payne so perfectly details in the Descendents.  As with rest of his excellent body of work (Sideways, Nebraska, About Schmidt), Payne uses the backdrop and environs as a character in the film capturing a lifestyle and sensibility that is truly singular to Hawaii--specifically Oahu.  It's a genuine and moving experience that not only engages you deeply with the characters (the two daughters are outstanding, specifically) but also with the place.

It was boring and I found myself fast forwarding through much of the film trying to get to scenes that were at least marginally interesting to no avail. I read about 20 of the 1 star reviews and agreed with most of what was said. In a typical and poorly contrived scene, the older daughter's boyfriend laughing at an elderly woman with dementia was unbelievable. And her elderly husband hitting him in the face even more unbelievable. The film ends with Matt King and his 2 daughters sitting on a sofa eating ice cream.

Finally, the kids move on from anger to realizing that dad is really tryin' here, and then . . . groups hugs all around, while the credits roll. Lather, rinse, repeat. It was worse in the 90's. My kids and I would see it coming a mile off, a supposedly off-handed comment ""You never know what day will be your last,"" a lost opportunity for closeness, which becomes fodder for regret for the rest of the movie, and my kids and I would finally blurt out ""Oh, no, mommy got the movie cancer!"" One fascinating feature of most of these ""I wake up each morning and remember to breath,"" films is the plot never involves a family in financial distress. Tom Hanks, the most famous bereaved dad of them all, was a successful Seattle architect. In this movie, George Clooney is a Hawaii land baron. I can't think of one movie on this topic I've ever seen that explores the way that a parent's death would utterly upend a family of limited finances. I suppose that's why the film-makers put such characters in money, so they can focus on the low-lying fruit - the tears and emotional toll of mom being gone, without the follow-up punch of the hospital and doctors coming to foreclose the house, which is what happens to real people. The Descendants is very careful to follow up each scene of life-without-mom trauma with breathtaking views of beaches and mountains, the kids are grouchy but smart and articulate, and George Clooney gets to march through the proceedings being his usual thoughtful, well-spoken and well-adjusted self. The Descendants did allow themselves one minor twist on the usual theme: Mom was not exactly a model parent or wife. Beyond that, it's a by-the-numbers Family Drama made quite watchable by a better-than-average script and very talented cast.",1411257600,,2070,4.784916201117318

Just as I was moved to tears by Jack Nicholson's character's poignant action in the film, About Schmidt, I was equally stirred by the understated dialogue throughout the Descendants - in particular, Mr. Clooney's character's loss for words during reflective and intense moments regarding his wife. His character's action, as well as other family members, depicts life as it frequently is - not every family member, who is in crisis and deserving of validation, is a jabber-mouth. Mr. Clooney's introspective character is acted flawlessly.

In a world consumed by incessant media debate, superfluous opinion, over-singing, and over-the-top acting, I welcomed the pensive discourse throughout the film. To that end, the human condition depicted was inventive and inspiring. It is one of my favorite George Clooney and Alexander Payne films.",1408924800,,969,5.410596026490066

4472931,3,B004UXUX4Q,"George Clooney is not infallible. The Oscar winner regarded by many as Hollywoods leading man has
not always picked the best projects. Last year, his one film, The American, was mediocre at best. Maybe
2009 was Clooneys best year with The Fantastic Mr. Fox and one of my favorites Up in the Air.
This year, his film offerings are The Ides of March, which was more political clich than political thriller
and his latest offering The Descendants, from Alexander Payne, the director who gave us Oscar-winner
Sideways (2004). Payne has had a successful yet somewhat overlooked body of work that includes great
films as Sideways, very good films like About Schmidt (2002) with Jack Nicolson, and admittedly some
not-so-great films like I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry (2007), where he probably like to forget he
was the screenwriter. My favorite Payne film is one you likely haven't seen. In a 2006 compilation of
short films entitled Paris, Je T'aime, his film 14e Arrondissement was truly one of my favorites (special
thanks to Terri A. for pointing out this great collection).
Paynes The Descendants ranks with About Schmidt in the very good category. This latest offering tells
the story of Matt King (played by Clooney) whose wife is in coma as a result of a boating accident. King
struggles to rebuild relationships with his two daughters and to deal with skeletons he didn't even know
were in his closet. All of this is set against the backdrop of a candid look at the Hawaiian landscape, of
which King and his cousins own a substantial piece that the family nearly all agrees they want to sell to a
property developer.
The script of this film was heavy with expository dialogue. There is a lot of lag between moments that
are truly moving but never inspiring. The film is well directed and well written with a cast that is very
good, and they give performances that are well very good. In the end, like a student with great
potential who is getting Bs, you want this film to rise from very good to exceptional. While it never gets
there, its still better than most other films in its class.",1408406400,,2097,4.716621253405995

4473059,3,B004UXUX4Q,"I had heard some hype about this movie, so I thought I would finally sit down and watch it.  The high points include the beautiful scenery of Hawaii and George Clooney's characterization of Matt King, a father who has lost touch with his family.  It is a bit slow at times, but this is a movie about coming to terms not just with grief and losing a family member, but with realizing that some things are worth far more than money.

Matt King is a lawyer who is the trustee of a huge parcel of untouched land on one of the islands that has come down in his family since they married into Hawaiian royalty, land that they are being forced to finally sell.  At the same time, his wife is in a coma in the hospital due to a boating accident and he has to deal with his two daughters, Scottie and Alexandra, something he clearly has not much practice in.  Not only that, Alexandra is clearly angry with her mother over some secret that he knows nothing about.

As the secret unfolds, Matt must deal with what his marriage had turned into along with his grief over his dying wife and the difficulties with having to tell their friends and family they all need to say good bye to her.  He also begins to struggle with the idea of giving up the family inheritance over to development that will ruin the pristine beauty of the place he is entrusted to protect.  He realizes that he had lost track of what was really important and strives to regain it.

A good movie to watch the one time, but I doubt I will keep it.  This was a very bittersweet movie.",1404777600,,1543,4.2714776632302405

4473101,5,B004UXUX4Q,"THE DESCENDANTS (2011) is a psycho-drama that centers around one family. In addition to the family, the characters include a married couple (Mark and Kai) who are friends of the family, and a paramour (Brian Speer) and his wife (Julie). The family takes the form of George Clooney, his comatose wife who is eventually taken off life-support, and their two teenaged daughters. The older daughter is Shailene Woodley (a hottie) and the younger daughter is Amara Miller (a plump girl). Shailene has a charismatic boyfriend played by Nick Krause. The film trods the well-worn themes of grief and death, betrayal in marriage, and teen rebellion. The film integrates these themes together as an exceptionally unified whole, resulting in a unique work of art. The film also has the plot element of a wife who decides to have an affair because her husband spends too much time at work, and too little time with his family (but what family in the United States of America does not have this particular problem?). What is further unique about this film, is the 1950s-style Hawaiian music that serves as a divider between each theme. Many of the out-of-door scenes take place under overcast skies, where the landscape features plants found in Hawaii and mountain formations that are characteristic of Hawaii (for example, I noticed and admired the Waimanalo region of the Ko'olau Mountains).

OPENING MONOLOGUE. The film begins with Clooney's wife, enjoying a motorboat ride in the ocean with Waikiki in the background. She is grinning as the boat bounces up and down on the waves, but she says nothing. Then, Clooney recites, ""My friends on the mainland think just because we live in Hawaii we're in paradise. Like a permanent vacation. We're all sipping mai tais, shaking our hips, catching waves. Are they insane? Do they think we're immune to life? How can they possibly think that our families are less screwed-up, our cancers less fatal, our heartaches less painful?"" (That is a great monologue, in my opinion.)

OPENING SCENES. The first scene shows Clooney's wife in a long-term coma, due to her motorboat accident. At the time, the boat was being driven by a family friend named Troy. Clooney continues his monologue, and he reveals that he spends too much time at work, and sacrifices time with his family.

AMARA ACTS UP. The next scene provides character development for Amara, the 10-year old daughter, and reveal that the mother's coma is causing Amara to ""act up."" Amara's school complains that Amara had submitted a photo scrapbook showing various photos of her comatose mother. Amara defends her scrapbook, and insists that it is ""art."" An irate mother complains to Clooney that Amara had sent her daughter a text message reading, ""WE ALL KNOW YOU GREW [bad word] OVER THE SUMMER."" Shortly after that, Amara is shown tossing lawn furniture into the family swimming pool.

PRINCESS KE'ALOHE'ANI. Clooney resumes his monologue, and reveals that his great great grandmother was Princess Ke'alohe'ani, who was a descendent of King Kamahameha. Clooney reveals that he is the sole trustee of a large amount of land in Kauai, and that he is preparing to sell the land. A continuing issue in this movie is whether he should sell the land to a local developer, to a developer on the mainland, or to donate it as a park thereby preventing any commercial development (Don't worry, I do not reveal the fate of this land).

DEALING WITH GRIEF. At 14 minutes into the film, we see a married couple (Mark and Kai) visiting the comatose wife. Kai is putting make-up on the comatose wife. At 16 minutes, Troy says to Clooney, ""I've been praying for her every day . . . last week I talked to her and she moved her hand and I was encouraged."" Clooney perceives that Troy is full of bull-bleep and he is annoyed, and snaps, ""That's enough!"" (It was not clear to me if Troy was expressing his grief, or if Troy was hoping to receive a greater portion of the sales money from the inherited property on Kauai.)

SHAILENE ACTS UP. Shailene, who is a hot 17-year old, is shown at 19 minutes into the movie, at her private high school on the Big Island. Clooney visits her, in an effort to solidify his fraying family. Clooney's narrative reveals that Shailene is taking drugs and going out with older guys. In the next scene, taking place at their home on Oahu, Shailene displays her attitude in a dialogue with Clooney: ""I have gotten my act together, I was just drinking . . . what if I got drunk on the one night you stopped by, so [bad word] you."" Shailene continues, and complains to her father (George Clooney) about his perpetual absence from his family. Shailene says, ""Maybe if you spent more time with her [Amara] she wouldn't act like a complete [unintelligible].""

HANKY-PANKY. At 25 minutes into the film, Clooney reveals to Shailene that the mother will be taken off life support. This dialogue takes place in the back yard, and Shailene is in the pool. Shailene immediately submerges herself, and we see that her face is contorted with pain, because of the bad news. Then she surfaces, and Clooney asks her to assist him in informing various friends and relatives about the plan to take the mother off life support. But Shailene does not want to cooperate and she scoffs at the idea. At first, the viewer will perceive Shailene as displaying attitude, but the viewer will be treated to a little surprise. Shailene exclaims, ""You really don't have a clue, do you. Dad, dad . . . mom was cheating on you. When I was home at Christmas, I caught her with a guy . . . you didn't even suspect, right? You were so busy . . . he had his hand on her ass, it was so gross . . . a few days later I knew what she was doing, like I'm [bad word] blind and then she got like super mad and yelled and denied it . . . I decided I didn't want anything more to do with her.""

TURNING POINT IN THE STORY. After Shailene's revelation, Clooney asks, ""Who is he?"" This is a turning point in the story, because after this point, Clooney plays detective and seeks out the paramour's identity (it is Brian Speer, a real estate developer). At 30 minutes into the movie, Clooney runs down his street to a neighbor's house (Mark and Kai), and without any words of introduction, he demands, ""Who is he?"" Mark immediately understands the question, but he just rolls his eyes. Kai defends the wife's infidelity, because of Clooney's devotion to his work, and absences from home.

PUTTING LIPSTICK ON A CORPSE. Clooney confronts Kai and demands, ""Who his he, did she love him?"" But Kai defends the cheating wife, ""I won't betray her because she is not here to defend herself . . . it's not her fault. Your marriage was not . . . she was lonely."" ""DON'T TALK TO ME IN CLICHES,"" retorts Clooney, feeling disgusted with Kai's rationalization of his wife's hanky-panky. Clooney angrily scolds Kai, ""You probably egged her on, in order to add a little drama to your life without any actual risk!"" Clooney then refers to the earlier visit by Mark and Kai, to the hospital, to see the comatose wife. Clooney refers to Kai's behavior at putting makeup on the comatose wife, and he exclaims, ""YOU WERE PUTTING LIPSTICK ON A CORPSE!"" Kai breaks down and cries. Then Clooney turns and leaves, and briskly walks back home. Marks runs out of his house and catches up with Clooney, and reveals the name of the paramour. Clooney pauses on a stone bridge, sobs for a moment, and then continues walking home. In the next scene, Nick Krause (Shailene's boyfriend) makes his entrance. Krause provides a bit of comic relief, now and then, for the rest of the movie. (I will not reveal any more of the story. As the plot continues, the film continues to reveal itself as a great work of art.)

CONCLUSION. It is rare to encounter a movie with so much dialogue, where the dialogue is so skillfully and artfully wrought. In my opinion, THE DESCENDANTS is a true milestone in movie-making. There do exist a few other artfully-wrought psychological dramas that include hanky-panky as a theme. Of these, what I recommend is NO DOWN PAYMENT with Tony Randall, and RAGE TO LIVE with Suzanne Pleshette. FIVE STARS.

By the way, it is the case that Amazon.com posted a review by Kathleen Fennessy (please see Fennessy's review above.).  Any person who has lived in Hawaii for a year or so will realize that Kathleen Fennessy is ABSOLUTELY CLUELESS.  Fennessy complains about the disheveled nature of the shirts worn by Mr. Clooney in the movie.  What Fennessy FAILS to realize is that the conventional and accepted business attire for businessmen, attorneys, and congressmen at the state and federal levels, is ""aloha shirts.""  Fennessy also fails to understand that aloha shirts are NOT to be tucked in (they are to be worn untucked, just like the Philippine barong shirt is to be worn untucked).",1404086400,2,8830,4.7024579560155235

It's a movie that caught me off guard so much that I'll have to watch it again.  The story got drawn out and confusing with the family of descendants - a little muddled, but only makes me want to watch it again to really be able to have it all sink in.  Do not watch it if you have recently had a similar life/death experience with a loved one.  Too sad. Otherwise, a beautiful movie.",1403568000,2,551,4.310679611650485

I got a kick out of the younger of the two (she was such an adorable imp!) I bought this movie because I am a big Judy Greer fan and didn't really know what to expect. It didn't take long for this movie to draw me in. Like I said ALL the actor's done a GREAT JOB and the plot just kept you maybe wondering how you would react to the situations as they unfolded. I think personally George and I would be a 180 degree off, but I thankfully have never been in his situation and George defiantly took the high road and probably done things correctly. At any rate, I really enjoyed this movie (I wish Judy Greer had a bigger part), it's a heart warming movie I think most people would enjoy...Really a nice movie.",1403395200,,852,4.33125

4473110,4,B004UXUX4Q,"Despite the multiplicity of themes, this film felt like it had been adapted from a short story rather than a novel. We have the main character's conflict in selling his family's land, complicated by an unintended benefit to the man his wife cheated with if he sells to the buyer who will ""keep the money in Hawaii."" There is the problem of dealing with a dying spouse in a vegetative state, who was just discovered to be unfaithful, along with the father-in-law who doesn't know, and cannot be told, what his daughter did. We have the excitement of the hunt as the Clooney character tries to track down his wife's lover. There's the daughter's teenage boyfriend, who first comes across as superficial, but by the film's end is revealed to have more going on. The beautiful locations and the various plot lines combine to produce a film that is engaging but thin. There is one great line where George Clooney says that you should give your children enough money so that they can do what they want, but not so much that they don't have to do anything. That's not an exact quote; he said it much better. The film is enjoyable but doesn't make any major points or offer any great catharsis. One redeeming feature is the outstanding soundtrack, featuring slack-key guitar legends such as Dennis Kamakahi, Gabby Pahinui, Keola Beamer, and many others.",1402790400,,1345,4.727659574468085

It has just enough detail to give it that Hawaiian flavor without weighing it down in too many details - just the right touch. It's directed and produced by Alexander Payne of Sideways fame.  I didn't like Sideways, more because I didn't care for the story than the style.  This time I could relate to the story, had read the book, and had lived in Hawaii.  Besides, I really appreciated his paring down and lifting up the end.  His style is existential so he is not trying to make a statement - you make what you will of it.  It speaks for itself though!  It probably helps to have lived in Hawaii, but it is not necessary to appreciate the movie.  (It might be necessary for some to appreciate the book.)

We can't hear Elizabeth's side of the story however because she's been in a boating accident, and is now in a coma. As Matt deals with his guilt over the distance between them, he winds up having to raise his 10 year old daughter alone, and brings his troubled older daughter, Shailene Woodley in a stand out performance, home to help. Tragedy and comedy ensue as the older daughter, Alex, has to quickly become an adult, dealing with the news that her mother is being taken off life support, helping raise her younger sister, and confessing the source of the big fight with her mother. Her mother cheated on her father, and planned to leave him.

To this cast of characters, add Elizabeth's bully father, a man who handles his grief by loudly bragging about his daughter's attributes, ignoring her faults, insulting everyone, and even attacking Alex's friend, and her friend, Sid, the guy who reminds you patience is a virtue.

Matt becomes immediately obsessed with the other man, wanting to know who he is, where he lives, what he does. What he does is important because Matt is embroiled in a huge real estate deal. His family are heirs to thousands of acres of virgin Hawaiian real estate, and the end of the trust is marking the sale for Matt, who is control of the estate. The other man, Brian Speers, is involved and will make a large commission from the sale.

Over the course of the movie, Matt and Alex drive by the man's home, dial his phone, follow him to Oahu and other stalkerish behaviors you can't really blame him for. In between, he becomes reacquainted with his daughters and learns to be a father all over again. At turns, sad and hilarious, Matt and the girls learn how to survive together.

Anyone who has lost someone who wasn't perfect (that's all of us) know it's quite possible to be spitting angry at someone who is dying. You feel guilty at the same time. Matt is dealing with a complex hurricane emotions that could sink anyone.

Tragically after Matt and Alex catch up to Brian, they find the whole thing was for nothing -- Brian didn't love Elizabeth afterall and had no intention of seeing her in the hospital.  But in a movie that seems to be about loss, Matt realizes, he really can control some things and he really can keep some things together. He decides to hang onto his inheritance, and the relationship with his girls, which you know from the last scene will keep growing. Matt is a luckier man than he thought, reminding us all how lucky we really are.",1398470400,2,2756,4.533199195171026

George Clooney's character is remarkable as a father suddenly finding himself alone with his two estranged daughters when their mother is hospitalized.

I was watching inside the walls, on the beach, in the airplane as a family struggled to cope and move on from 'the big tragedy' and all the small ones as well.

It would have been better had it focused more on the infidelity fallout. It didn't. I didn't understand the relationship between the oldest daughter and her friend. Were they boyfriend, girlfriend? Where did they meet? I don't think his character (Sid?) had any impact on the story line.

There is barely a storyline at all, and though the actors endeavor to save it with (mostly) inconsistent, overwrought performances, the film is still awful.  I will concede that Robert Forster, as the dying woman's father, does a terrific job overall.  Amara Miller, the younger of the two daughters, does a great hospital scene near the end, but is otherwise fairly forgettable (except for all the foul language). George Clooney is completely miscast, Shailene Woodley looks bored most of the time, and Beau Bridges just seems confused as to how his lines are supposed to be delivered.

4473359,3,B004UXUX4Q,if you watched the preview for this movie than you pretty much know the whole story. Its not a badly done movie but it is completely expected. George Clooney plays pretty much the same kind of guy you think he is in real life and the same kind of character that weve seen him play in the past like Up in the Air. This feels like a role he picked so he has a chance for an award but its nothing ground breaking nor is it challenging. Hes a lawyer who is in charge of a family trust and has to make a decision on that while his wife gets into an accident and now is in a coma. Hes trying to rein in his two young daughters and finds out that his comatose wife cheated on him. He takes his daughters around to find the guy that he was cheating with on so that he can see her before she dies. Hes generally an upstanding guy with all the right intentions and finds himself overwhelmed. Only major difference with tons of other films is that this one is located on Hawaii. You get lots of Jack Johnson-esque music and too many Hawaiian shirts a la Maui Jim. I was a bit underwhelmed.,1392595200,,1078,4.065727699530516
4473360,3,B004UXUX4Q,"Clooney has always seemed to me a latter day William Holden: glib, urbane, charming, but a bit insincere and not very deep. I think he does very well in roles like Up in the Air which exploit those characteristics, but here where deep feelings should be conveyed, though this character is rather low key and de/repressed, he fails. I couldn't help but think how good William Hurt  [brilliant at playing undemonstrative characters who have much brewing inside ] would have been in this role. Additionally, the film begins with Clooney's wife's coma and so fails to draw the viewer in, simply by not providing back story. We don't see any scenes from the marriage--and so we have no emotional investment in it or the characters.

In any case, when Clooney finds out his wife was having an affair, he takes his two messed up daughters to Kauai, where the lover is vacationing with his charming family, ostensibly to give the man a chance to say a last goodbye to the wife who is on life support. There is a subplot about a land sale on the island, a last mega million parcel belonging to Clooney's extended family which will be sold and developed into a resort.

Here the movie is stolen by both the betrayed wife [ Judy Greer ] and Clooney's cousin played by the brilliant Beau Bridges. Bridges has about seven minutes of screen time, and yet, is so good that I knew who this man was and could imagine his entire back story just with what he did with his body language, intonation and physical appearance.

The movie is okay, the Hawaiian islands are pretty, but it is neither a comedy nor an enlightening commentary on human affairs. I far preferred Up in the Air, in which Clooney's talents truly shone.",1392508800,,1703,4.592105263157895

4473362,1,B004UXUX4Q,"This film missed the opportunity at being wholesome. The ""F"" word is uttered at will with no reason whatsoever. Kids have no respect for their parents. Yes, the dying mother had an affair, but that's not the point, sadly sin is part of the world we live in and these things happen and are occuring more often. Clooney's character makes no effort at all in disciplining his kids and their foul mouths, and discovers that his youngest at age 10 watches porno at a friend's house. Was it necessary to include this filth in a script? What a disgusting piece of rubbish. Shame on Clooney, who's no big deal of an actor, the producers and the rest of those who participated in the filming of this massive loser.

The film follows a lawyer named Matt (played by Clooney) who is struggling to take care of his daughters and to maintain his personal affairs after a tragic accident puts his wife in a coma.  Although the plot of the movie is quite dark, writer/director Alexander Payne makes sure to balance the movie with plenty of comic relief.  The soundtrack is also amazing; every song in the movie is Hawaiian and every song fits its scene perfectly.

4473396,4,B004UXUX4Q,"Interesting movie played by a solid troupe in an uncommon setting. Hawaiian liberationists, if any still remain, may groan at the pastel treatment of their music to lend local colour where the culture has otherwise been erased. But, despite that, the settings are beautiful and exotic, unusual for a US movie (surprisingly: why are US films set so seldom in Hawaii?), nicely suiting this off-beat story.

Clooney's no Philip Seymour Hoffman, but in this role as a bereaved yet deceived husband he does very well - never overacting nor relying on his looks. On the contrary, aside from seeming helpless in the face of his lippy, near-feral daughters, he dares to look klutzy and way uncool while running flat-footedly to the neighbours' - nicely reflecting his character's distress and bewilderment (beaut directorial touch, that). Several other fine actors also give better-than-standard performances, each one in their own way adding to the subtle, mostly unpredictable string of scenes that result in this quirky narrative. They include Shailene Woodley as his elder daughter; her boyfriend, a half-witted but endearing lout who tags along to witness the proceedings, mostly providing (very) comic relief; the ever-reliable Robert Forster in a brief but meaty role as Clooney's cranky father-in-law; and the always charming Judy Greer, briefly adding a significant twinkle in the oddest scene of revenge you're ever likely to witness.

Fine acting all around, often hitting just the needed notes to add up to a nicely-told, rather bizarre, not in the least commercial little story. In all, provided you're patient, you will see plenty of unforced poignancy and mercifully few moments of fake splash or presumed epiphany.

Clooney is the obvious audience magnet for this film - but, as suggested, there's plenty besides him worth catching. I admit I like his fare, as I do Matt Damon's and Bruce Willis's: they make watchable movies. But when he gravitates toward projects like this, I know he's got something more than just entertainment and cash in mind. So, unless you crave only a jaw-punching, gun-toting George in action flicks that zip right along, this is recommended.",1391472000,,2177,5.214285714285714

4473398,4,B004UXUX4Q,"This was an interesting story with a clever choice for a setting. A man's wife is mortally wounded in a boating accident. Their marriage had been unraveling prior to the accident. Their teenage daughter is struggling with alcohol and bitterness. The man is on the brink of a major decision about inherited land that will make him the bad guy with either his family or the locals depending on the outcome. And all this misery takes place in paradise: Hawaii.

Clooney narrates and is a great narrator. The characters are believable and authentic. Nothing felt overdone. Shailene Woodley plays the angry teenage daughter and she is outstanding. It also had nice closure for the ending without being sappy.

Truthfully, I can't put my finger on why I wouldn't give this a 5. It is a good movie that was well done. There were many scenes that I would call great. When Clooney's character confronts his wife's lover he asks him if he loved her. The scoundrel pauses before answering (b/c clearly the truth was ""no"") and you can see the pain on Clooney's face. Even in her betrayal, he didn't want her to be used like that. Or maybe he felt even more worthless that his wife was so desperate for affection that she couldn't see the obvious. Either way, it was a surprising question for him to ask and his reaction to the response was one of many things that fleshed out his character.

Why no 5 star??? I guess overall it just didn't blow me away. I'd still recommend it, though.",1391385600,5,1473,4.593155893536122

In this one, he plays a husband of a woman who is intensive care with whom he has drifted apart and who is hooked up to life support.  At the same time, he is dealing with two acting-out daughters as well as a major land deal that is approaching a deadline and which will place a development on family inherited pristine Hawaiian land..  We find as we go along that the land issues weave into the issues between his wife and himself.  Out of the tragedy and seemingly downbeat themes, this is really a story about a family coming together and family loyalty - this in both merging plot lines.  This is a very well-acted film, not only by the Mr. Clooney but also especially by the actors playing the two daughters - Shailene Woodley and Amara Woodley, and also by others such as Beau Bridges who plays Cousin Hugh.  One of the things that really makes this film, however, is the way it transports one to its Hawaiian setting by means of both its camera work as well as soundtrack.

The acting is poor; Clooney makes a poor attempt to act like he once cared about this woman right at the end but there was no evidence of his struggle up until this point and the part that should have been tender and poignant was almost laughable at its attempt to be believable.

It is so refreshing to watch a movie where a character deals with a difficult situation with dignity.,1386633600,,269,4.4
4473460,3,B004UXUX4Q,"This movie created considerable buzz when it was released, but it's hard to see exactly why at this distance.  It's well acted and well shot, but it seems thin, and a movie about the weight of the past on the present can't afford to seem thin.  There are two pasts in question: first, the past of the marriage of Matt and Elizabeth King (George Clooney is Matt); then there's the past of the Hawaiian island, a large chunk of which Matt's family has inherited and which is held under trust, with Matt the trustee.  We never see Matt's marriage; we have to take it for granted that it's at a crisis (because we're told), but Elizabeth is in an irreversible coma when George learns, from his elder daughter, that she was having an affair at the time of the accident that has made her comatose.  If ever flashbacks of a substantive kind were needed, it's in a situation like this.  Without them, we remain a bit disconnected from Matt's inner life.  Clooney has to try to suggest a complexity that the movie doesn't underwrite, and I don't think that an actor can easily do that.  We see the past of the island insofar as it effects Matt's family in the shots of the land they own -- beautiful unspoiled land.  We can see it, and we get a connection to it that we don't get to Matt's marriage (shots of his comatose wife don't do that).  The two come together when Matt learns that the man with whom his wife is having an affair stands to profit very handily for managing the transfer of property in the event that the sale goes through.  Matt as trustee has the power of decision -- he can make his rather wastrel relatives millionaires, or he can preserve the land (at least for a while).  If he doesn't sell, what's his motive?

George Clooney has too little to work with here.  He does fine, but it's a thin role.  Matt's daughters, with less history, are more interesting, and the two young actors (Amara Miller and Shailene Woodley) are very good.  Beau Bridges, as one of Matt's cousins hoping for millions, is underused.  Judy Greer, as the wife of the man whom Elizabeth has been involved with, has a strong scene near the end.  It's credible because she plays a woman reacting to a history she doesn't really know, and she does it splendidly.

The problems, then, are with the concept (and to a lesser degree with the writing).  Obviously, it's tonally challenging to blend comic elements with so many shots of a dying woman -- and Elizabeth takes the whole movie to die.  To an extent, Payne manages the blend reasonably -- thanks partly to Sid (Nick Krause), Matt's elder daughter's surfer dude boyfriend, a character who ends up being less stupid than he looks.  Clooney's contribution to the humor -- quite well done -- is his acting the part of a father who is learning on the job, so to speak.  Still -- it doesn't add up to much.  It lacks real emotional power.  What might Mike Leigh have done with a story like this?",1386288000,2,2932,4.4680451127819545
4473461,4,B004UXUX4Q,"It must be hard for George Clooney to have people forget he's George Clooney. Hell, in the novel Scottie even walks around in a ""Ms. Clooney"" tee shirt! He comes close to disappearing into his character in this movie. There's still his occasional smirk, but for the most part, the material allows him to rise above and show a bit more vulnerability. And the story is told beautifully. It has an ease and rolling narrative that breezes from scene to scene. Hawaii is more than the setting, it's the MOOD. And it contrasts perfectly with the inner turmoil Matt King is going through. His decision whether to reveal who his wife truly is to those who love her, to spoil her memory, mirrors his decision on who to sell his land to, and both stories are given great care and affection by Alexander Payne. He finds the humor in tragedy, and knows that no matter what events are happening in people's lives, normal life still intrudes and returns them to the mundane everyday living. In a way that is a curse, to not be able to absorb the depth of tragedies in life, but it is also a blessing, and what keeps us sane in the face of sadness.",1386288000,3,1133,4.425837320574162

Take a paper thin plot, an absence of realistic character development, preposterous moments like Clooney's character going into Sid's room in the middle of the night to ask him advice, knowing this goofball's main vocabulary word was ""dude"", and you have what Hollywood considers an Oscar-nominee. It's really a strange film with strange people throughout. They are not Fargo strange, a film which is hugely entertaining. They are just strange.

4473489,3,B004UXUX4Q,"I saw the movie awhile back, was unimpressed, then got the book for a couple dollars in a KDD and read it. It's rare when a movie is better than a book, but this one is. Mainly because at least we have some decent scenery and Hawaiian music, and the book is oddly bereft of the ability to give any sense of Hawaii.  Also George Clooney is not bad.

But the rest of movie is essentially a people drama, and the people suck.  And that's my complaint.  Who ARE these people?  Not just the woman herself, who has so much but couldn't be a decent wife and mother to her family, and take joy in what she had. Apparently, the wife whined about not having thrills and shopping sprees.  So being dissatisfied, does she do the adult thing? Talk to her husband, try to work it out, get a divorce if all else fails? No, she has an affair, and worse, one she schemes to set herself up monetarily with her lover, once her clueless husband dumps a big deal in his lap. Then she'll divorce huppy to spend the $$.  Alas, she's still thrill seeking, the deal undone, with one daughter is in a residential boarding school for drug use and the other with issues, when she gets herself in a fatal coma.

The dad meanwhile, doesn't believe in living off trust funds.  That's why they'd been living on his income as a  lawyer.  Punahoe not being exactly a cheap school, with two tuitions as well the price of that house -- he worked a lot. This causes everyone, wife, kids, friends, to resent him because he works, when the rest of them seem to lay around and complain.  So I don't really see what the problem was with Clooney. I mean, the wife didn't work. She had a great life with what she had. What the heck did she have to complain about?

Meanwhile the friends are dumping on Clooney, because that his wife was a lying cheat wasn't HER fault, because he was boring, busy working. With her having all those long days free, what else did she have to do but look for excitement?  Like I said, who ARE these people?  His wife's father too -- that his daughter is in a coma is not her fault for being stupid and reckless -- no, Clooney should have bought her more toys and boats and let her shop and she would have been satisfied spending his money, rather than seeking other thrills.

Anyway, the plot revolves around their tying up the issues with the comatose wife, her relationships, the screwed up, entitled kids, and the husband, who seems like a decent straight up sort of guy with no flaws other than the fact that he spends his days working for a living, which is apparently too uncool to justify other human beings treat him with decency, not his kids, his wife, her parents, or his friends.

There are some redeeming parts to the movie. The older girl does seem to grow up a bit. The husband gets more involved with his kids. It's nice to see Hawaii on film, and hear a little HAwaiian music.  The essential plot and characterization of the movie, though, like most of the people in the movie, were just not worth the time.",1382400000,2,3012,4.338680926916221

Clooney does a good job of appearing to be a man who has been somewhat of a failure as a husband and father. He has definitely passed the sex pot, leading man role and seems to have embraced roles that fit his age and station in life. His character's life takes a hard turn and he is forced to cope with what is left. I absolutely hated the character played by the Bridges brother, but loved the setting. Kind of an odd movie.

4473545,2,B004UXUX4Q,"My wife's family is from Hawaii.  She is a descendant of Hawaiian royalty.  Her family is very much like the main character in this movie.  However, that did not sway our opinion of this film at all.  In fact, I think the only redeeming quality about this film is that it did get most of the Hawaiian heritage and feeling correct.  We recognized the feeling inside the homes, the blankets, the 'Outrigger' Club..(although they show them at what is supposed to be inside the club... it wasn't).  My wife is from a family that looks Howlie (sorry if I spelled that wrong...). Her great x3 Uncle is credited for bringing surfing back in the beginning of the 20th century.  They are very much part of the Hawaiian state.  She knows the exact feeling that this film tries to communicate... That living in Hawaii as part of it's heritage doesn't mean your life is perfect.  All that part is great...  The bad part is that the story is just horrible.  After the first 30 minutes I began to realize that the movie is never going to take off... It just goes on and on and on about his wife in a coma... Does she come out of it?  Does she die?  I don't want to give that away... Let's just say that it goes on and on and one and on and on... and then... nothing... When the credits rolled at the end... My wife said, ""is it over?""  I was blown away.  We understood the message and we noticed the blanket at the end was the same one as... (don't want to give that away either)... I am trying to say, we understood everything... We go it... It just wasn't a good plot or story.  The acting is really great.  The stars are top notch... Just a terrible script.  What a shame.  I gave the extra star for portraying the heritage pretty accurately for a lot of Hawaiian families.  They don't all look like hoola dancers or Asian people.

4473559,4,B004UXUX4Q,"I will start out by saying two things. One, this movie is not entirely fiction. What i mean is, the situation and conflict present in The Descendants does happen from time to time in the real world. Two, Despite the ONE con I have, this passively honest movie gets a solid A+ in my book.
The movie stars George Clooney as Matt King, Shailene Woodley as his daughter Alexandra, Judy Greer as his wife Julie, and Matthew Lillard as Brian Speer. George Clooney was terrific, Shailene Woodley was excellent and the remaining supporting cast did his/her job exceptionally well. I also really admired the scenery and where the movie was shot. There are just gorgeous set pieces and settings in the movie that go well with the overall tone. The story line has a strong message and shows some of the struggles of how to be a parent.
My only con with the movie is there is so much profanity. And I know there are those who will say things like ""well what about this movie?"" or ""well this movie has curse words too!'' And the movie IS rated R so obviously, I would not highly recommend this for younger children.

Is The Descendants a perfect movie? No but it is very close. To describe this movie in one full sentence: Stunningly relatable and more absorbing than you would think, The Descendants goes to show that sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are exactly the same.

4473579,5,B004UXUX4Q,"I stayed away fron this flick at first because I have been reactive to Clooney hype. I liked it just OK the first time I watched it. Now I've found myself going back to see it several tines, I''m not entirely sure why. Because I miss Hawaii? For the music?
Some poor reviews here seem to be due to having been promised a comedy. I wasn't promised a comedy and it wasn't a comedy. Neither was it 'sad'. A commenter complains that Clooney is not accurately cast as a father figure. But he is exactly cast as a father and husband who has been putting all of his attention on business, flying to different islands as a lawyer, and barely knowing his children. By the end he and his children have been through a real and painful life's adventure with each other and settle into a connective balance together which shows each one has changed and grown.
The story, of a man sleuthing out the man with whom he learns his wife has been having an affair is one we haven't seen before. He does it with the help of his 16-year old daughter, the one who knew her mother had been having an affair and had written her off because of it. The father and daughter flying to another island to find and maybe confront the adulterous man while the mother is in a coma is new and raw. Yet, all of it unfolds satisfyingly and evenly, with no melodrama orr sentiment or more or less than real feelings.
The one brief scene which marred the reality that had been set was when Clooney goes at night to spy on the man and pops his head up and down behind a hedge. This slapstick effect didn't fit.
Everything else came across as real and all the actors were superb.",1368921600,,1638,4.287096774193548

4473583,2,B004UXUX4Q,"I watched this looking for the funny best movie of the year that I was told was in store for me. I didn't find it. Here's what I got instead.

Characters I can't respect or identify with- Clooney is an out-of-touch wimp with no healthy boundaries. When his daughter tells him that his wife, who is in a coma, has cheated on him, he decides to share all his next steps with his daughter and her friend. I suppose that is why his kids don't respect him and curse in front of him. SPOILER ALERT: His wife's lover's wife comes to the hospital (flying from another island) to see his dying wife because her husband won't because he doesn't love her. Then she tells the dying woman that she forgives her. That is just not realistic. It's bizarre.

Wasted location- There are LOTS of movies where the location is a huge part of the movie. It's like a silent supporting actor. This film looks as it it were set up that way, but fails to make that happen. I don't know if it is the way it was shot or what, but Hawaii never comes across as this pristine, romantic landscape worth saving. Since a big chunk of the plot revolves around that, it's a huge disappointment.

Lack of cohesiveness- It looks like this was supposed to be a movie about a family drama, death, love, life, the continuation of life, and healing. Bubbles of those things pop up, but they never blend. They never gel. They are just elements instead of ingredients woven into the fabric of the story that create a cohesive picture. It's like telling a story by saying, ""This and this, and then that and that. Get it?""

There were funny moments that made my lips move to the side of my mouth, but nothing laugh-out-loud or even really smile cracking humor.

It's not a complete waste. I didn't feel like I lost two hours of my life, but I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anyone else. It didn't entertain me, didn't make me reflect, and didn't teach me anything.",1367625600,5,1930,4.394957983193278

And you have to get past the first half of the movie with the character of the children being extremely disrespectful. You almost wish you could discipline them yourself.  The movie is set in Hawaii, and contains a lot of traditional Hawaiian music.  It may be considered a chick flick, I'm not sure, since men vary in their interest.

I have seen this format storyline many times before and It is Ok if you have nothing to do and need something to watch, but it isn't Oscar material nor is it worth premium dollars for buying media like I did.

4473644,5,B004UXUX4Q,"This is the fourth Alexander Payne movie I've seen and in some ways it is the best. It is the most affecting, that's for sure, at least for me. I cried through a good part of it. What I found so touching was the way the characters came to grips with the reality of their lives and in the way the King family--Matt (George Clooney), Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller)--strengthened their family ties despite the tragedy and the various unpleasant revelations.

As Elizabeth King lies dying in a deep coma after a water skiing accident, it is her workaholic husband Matt who has to take care of a slightly dysfunctional family. He is the trustee of a great Hawaiian estate on the island of Kauai that now must be sold. Getting closer to his children he first learns that younger daughter Scottie's behavior needs a lot of work. Then he goes to the Big Island where his older daughter Alexandra is at school and finds her drunk. And then he learns... Well, it's better if you see the movie and see what she tells him that so sets him off.

While this is almost as funny as the other Payne movies I've seen (Election 1999, About Schmidt 2002, and Sideways 2004) it is not as satirical. Payne reaches for our hearts in this one instead of our whimsy.

Clooney is excellent in a part that emphasizes his controlled and very winning leading man style. He does a lot with restraint and subtle expressiveness. Woodley (just 19 as the film was shot) played the wiser-than-her-years teen with just enough edginess and spitfire to be believable. She is so pretty that just looking at her brought me to tears. But perhaps the most natural performance was that by Amara Miller as the foul-mouthed, chubby little girl who wants to be as grownup as her big sister.

Interesting to me personally were the settings on location in Hawaii since I watched the film not long after spending nearly three weeks on Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai. I recall driving into Princeville (as Matt and family do) on Kauai and being in the exact spot at the airport as they were. And the shot of the ocean with Honolulu in the background that opened the movie brought back memories.

The real strength of the movie for me though was in the script and the direction. The clever dovetailing of the plot and subplot (the search for the truth about Matt's marriage; and the disposition of the fabulous estate on Kauai) melded seamlessly together as Matt meets real estate agent (and not a nice guy), Brian Speer. Underlying the story is something deeper though, and that is the growth as human beings that we see the characters go through, especially that of Matt and Alexandra.

Excellent in a minor role was Judy Greer as Brian Speer's wife.

4473645,4,B004UXUX4Q,"Pros: Let's be honest for a moment. You come to this movie for George Clooney, and if we're going to keep being honest, he's certainly worth the price of admission, suiting his best actor nomination nicely. But what may be surprising to some of you is the fact that his co-star, Shailene Woodley, does her part to keep pace with the much higher pedigreed Clooney. While other characters provide welcome comic relief and dramatic foils, Clooney's Matt and Woodley's Alex give the film a very human element with whom the viewer can't help but identify. Who would have thought we would be saying that about the first Batman with nipples (part of me feels bad for planting that thought in your head... but only part) and a chick most known for starring in modern teen soap operas?

Aiding in the effort to get the viewers emotionally invested is a very deep immersion in the Hawaiian setting with the film's characters. From the stunning visuals to the quaint musical soundtrack to the constant bare feet, the movie brings the feel of Hawaii into the theater (well, I'm assuming this, since I've admittedly never actually been to Hawaii). In the end, you're left feeling as though you have actually experienced the events of the movie side by side with Matt and Alex.

Cons: I know I just talked about how easy it is to identify with the main characters, but it's actually a little difficult to identify with a lawyer trust fund baby who lives in a tropical paradise and struggles with anything. *Coughfirstworldproblemscough*. Okay, so it's not quite so superficial as that, but you do still have to kick yourself every time you're reminded of the fact that, really, these people have it alright. Well, I didn't actually need to do any kicking of myself, because I was so busy enjoying the movie, but hopefully I just planted that thought into your head.

Overall: Despite the plot revolving around a topic that traditionally makes me pretty uncomfortable, it's all actually a funny and enjoyable movie. The script made me breeze through the whole viewing, eagerly waiting to see what would happen to [us] next. On the other hand, while it is a fun to watch little movie, it isn't really all that special. Nothing about it stands out to me, and I'm pretty sure in five years I'll mostly just remember it for being nominated for best picture. But after gazing into Clooney's dark and stormy eyes, I can't help but give the movie an 8 out of 10.",1362873600,,2440,4.696261682242991

4473648,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants starring George Clooney is another winning film from the handsome actor. To be honest, I was never a fan of Clooney's earlier work. I just never thought he had real acting chops, it wasn't until I saw him in ""Up in the Air"" did I start to take notice. I truly feel Clooney should stick to dramatic roles and The Descendants is no exception. He is funny, naive, and completely charming as Matt King, a lawyer who's wife has been seriously hurt in a boating accident. Matt is not a hands-on kind of parent, his two young daugthers both have some emotional, behavorial problems and he must take the sole parent role when he gets news that his wife's condition is not improving. I also really liked Judy Greer in this film, she's so delightful and she has great chemistry with Clooney. I love this film, it's got some unexpected funny moments and it's also serious which are the kind of films that I found the most entertaining.

4473665,4,B004UXUX4Q,"This is a good movie but I don't think it's a great movie. On the plus side, the performances are great. On the minus side, the story has several threads which never really converge. The impending death of Clooney's wife, the sale of his giant beach estate, his search for his wife's ex-lover, his difficult relationship with his kids; all these themes are explored with sensitivity, but they never manage to build up into an integrated picture.

But what does stand above and beyond all this is the music. I have never listened to native Hawaiian music before and the soundtrack moved me so much that I promptly purchased it even before I finished watching the movie. I found that a lot of the pieces come from a famous islander named Gabby Pahinui. The music is just amazing; evocative, rustic and effectively conveying both bitter and sweet emotions (apt to the movie's themes). Most surprisingly, it made me nostalgic and wistful about a land I haven't even visited. It almost made me feel like I had lived in the state for years.

Something has to be said about a movie soundtrack that's so good that it eclipses anything the movie has to offer. It doesn't mean that the movie is bad, it just means that the music is extraordinary. I would recommend the movie, but I would independently recommend buying the soundtrack even if you don't watch the movie.",1362009600,,1358,4.677824267782427

4473668,5,B004UXUX4Q,"There is a lot to like about The Descendants.  First, it stars George Clooney, who has become one of the best actors of the 2000s and 2010s with convincing performances like those in Michael Clayton and The Ides of March.  This go-round adds to the list of winning and memorable roles.  All are unique, but all uniquely Clooney.

The man is a movie star, plain and simple.  He can cover the full gamut of emotions and affects from depressed to sad to annoyed to upset to angry, and everything in between.  In The Descendants he displays his acting chops for portraying sadness, confusion, rage, and remorse convincingly.  Although his protagonist is a faulted man, neglectful of his family and too focused on his finances and business, there is a reality and humanity that Clooney brings to Matt King.  With his universal winner personality and natural charm, Clooney makes King seem more burdened than burdensome.

Second, you will feel transported to Hawaii.  Hawaii plays a big role here and one that only an experienced filmmaker could incorporate seamlessly.  The distinctive ukulele music, the lush tropical landscape, the omnipresent sense of separation from the mainland, the laid-back dress--all of these elements of The Descendants factor into painting a picture of a place that is very different from anywhere.  Different rules apply.  Lawyers don't wear powersuits; they sport goofy, floral short-sleeved button-downs.

One thing that was striking to this Lower 48er is that, although Hawaii is perceived as a tropical vacation spot for most of the world, it is also a home to many people.  Along with being a ""home"" comes a number of generic and commonplace facets of the landscape that few consider.  There is rush hour traffic.  There are suburbs with cookie-cutter subdivisions.  Skyscrapers filled with offices dot the downtown of populated cities.  Most importantly, even in a green and temperate vacation climate, there are still places that its inhabitants go to escape from ""paradise.""  The Descendants does an excellent job of bringing these realities to the viewer in subtle ways, like by incorporating a mini-getaway to a beach house on another island into the plot.  No matter where you live, even in a touristy place like Hawaii, the inhabitants still like a change of scenery.  Humans try to escape their day-to-day perspective by changing scenery to contemplate, refocus, and reinvigorate, even in places where the scenery is amazing.  Hawaii is no different, and this film drives the point home.

Third, the complexities of family are incorporated effectively in a few different ways.  King's daughters are at different places in their lives.  One is a preteen, just getting a minor taste of the difficulty of growing up with peer pressure, expectations, rejections, and bouncing emotions.  Another is firmly and typically teen, exhibiting a rebellious streak that King is forced to manage and harness to his advantage.  He does so even without the help, and you could say the hindrance, of his comatose and unfaithful wife.

The Descendants also creatively explores and highlights the dynamics of extended-family relationships and wrangling over inheritances.  Without giving away the resolution, a number of different and diverse relatives have their say in a decision that King is forced to make.  The film reminds us that we do not pick these people in our lives.  They are family, and we are stuck with them.  Some we will appreciate and embrace.  Others we will merely tolerate and neglect, or even outright reject.  When those family ties also are bound up with monetary concerns, legacies, perceived wishes of descendants, and the future of all concerned parties, it gets messy, testy, and there are no easy solutions.  We see all of this in play through Matt King.

Finally, The Descendants takes a complicated story and makes it easy to get drawn in.  There is a lot going on.  An extramarital affair, bubbling teen angst, plotted revenge, inconvenient death, family strife, business ventures, not to mention lots of names to remember and cross-relationships.  In the end, you realize that the focus is Matt King and his discombobulated and imperfect life.  We only see a slice of it over maybe a period of weeks, but it is enough to paint a multifaceted, challenging, and realistic painting of the highs and lows of life.",1361491200,,4361,5.077355836849508
4473669,5,B004UXUX4Q,"Having lived on one of the Hawaiian islands for nearly four years, I could relate to many of the moments in this wonderful film.

The soundtrack of a long list of classic Hawaiian music makes the film even better, in fact, nearly perfect. And George Clooney makes the best performance of his career since The Perfect Storm.

4473718,5,B004UXUX4Q,"This is a great film; definitely one of the ten best of 2011, and I would want to see it regardless of who was in the lead role. But George Clooney's powerful performance takes this movie to a level it would not have achieved w/out him, It is his best film role ever...my opinion of course...and his Golden Globe award and Oscar nomination were well deserved. Clooney is Matt King, a Hawaiian attorney and sole trustee of a family trust that includes some 25K acres of prime Hawaiian land. He is trying to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife is involved in a tragic boating accident. She is not killed in the accident; in fact she is in a coma for most of the film....which is important to the plotline. He learns through his oldest daughter, Alex, that his wife, Elizabeth, was having an affair before her accident. He is also under pressure from the rest of the family to sell the land before the trust expires. So, Matt has a lot on his plate...a multitude of problems that would overwhelm most men. Not only does Clooney do a masterful job in portraying Matt, the young actress, Shailene Woodley, is perfectly cast as the 17 year old Alex.  The support cast is also superb. The score consists of Hawaiian music by different artists and perfectly sets the mood; and Alexander Payne masterfully puts it all together behind the camera.",1360281600,7,1348,4.593360995850622
4473719,5,B004UXUX4Q,"I have watched The Descendants about 9 times, again each time we have houseguests.  There are 3 main reasons I am so drawn to this movie:

1) I lived on the windward side of Oahu for 10 years in the seventies.  The musical score of the movie is a collection of the best authentic musicians, most of whom were entertaining and recording the music I grew to love while I was there.  I could float away on beautiful memories just by listening to the score.

2) The struggle for commercialization of the Islands is a constant struggle tainted by greed and insensitivity to the original Hawaiian culture and people.  I am so glad the movie dealt with this very real issue, and I was ecstatic about how it was ultimately handled...from the heart.  Love of the Land and the People....that is what Hawaii is really about.

3) The theme of forgiveness always touches me deeply...yes, this is how we go on living our llives with some peace.

I was also pleased that the only well-known Hollywood star in the movie was George Clooney...the rest of the cast seemed like real people.  I finally recognized Beau Bridges, but somehow, he is no longer a STAR idol to me.

I don't know what the posters who raved about this film were smoking, or the parents of the girls, who allowed them to appear in this horrible, filthy film. If you want to see a film with young girls whose lines consisted almost entirely of obscenities and treating people, especially their father, with gross disrespect, this is the film for you. I felt so sorry for Clooney's character, whose main flaw seemed only to be that he worked too hard, but otherwise loved his daughters and his family and friends. None of them seem to return his affection, blaming him for his wife's infidelities and the accident that killed her. I wanted him to stand up to all of them, especially his daughters and his wife's best friend who wailed that the ""affair wasn't the wife's fault..."" to him, and he did confront his older daughter at the comatose mother's bedside, only to have both daughters hurl obscenities at each other, a few moments later, as the younger cretin child brings a friend in to display her mother. The ""wonderfully mellow"" Sid is also a completely brainless and mannerless waste of air as he laughs at the grandmother, who has Alzheimer's. The point of the film was that Clooney had been an absent father who had failed his daughters, but I certainly didn't see that the mother had been a stellar parent, with two hoodlum, filthy mouthed daughters. I actually didn't see the end of the film, I couldn't stand any more. I gave the film two stars, one for Clooney's honest attempt to portray this character, and the other for the Hawaiian scenery.",1358726400,2,1598,4.810909090909091

4473764,3,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants, which is a supposed comedy-drama film written and directed by Alexander Payne and based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Cummings, is actually a relatively heavy drama with a few funny scenes that focuses on relatively unlikeable characters, especially the two daughters but Matt (George Clooney) has his moments as well. In deciding on whether or not I find a film good or not I focus on three key elements in my decision, whether or not it has likeable protagonists, whether or not it's boring, and whether or not the film achieves in what it sets out to do, as in being funny if it's a comedy, being serious and dramatic as a drama, and being frightening as a horror film, it succeeds at being dramatic, and it succeeds in not being boring, but it fails as far as characters go, I didn't particularly care for any of the characters and because of this I could really care less about what happened to them. In fact, it isn't surprising that the wife cheated on the George Clooney's character because he was such a prick. The acting was good I suppose and I enjoyed the setting, but it added very little to the plot or story, this film could just as easily have taken place in California or even Florida. Despite taking place in such a beautiful, paradise setting the story is too dark and serious, which further weakens the appeal of this film. The little side plot regarding the land issue with Matt's family felt forced and completely unnecessary, it seems to be there only to justify the title of the film.

4473798,5,B004UXUX4Q,"It is pretty difficult to describe what kind of a film Alexander Payne's new film ""The Descendants"" is. Some will think it is a comedy drama about messy nature of life. Others may feel the film is rather sad, dealing with life's most devastating moment. Perhaps both views are right.

The story itself is simple. George Clooney plays Matt King, a successful Hawaiian lawyer and sole trustee of pristine land on Kauai Island. His wife Elizabeth has been in coma since the boating accident a few weeks ago. Having been too busy, he doesn't know how to talk to his two daughters, precocious 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and rebellious 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley). In his voiceover Matt pleads with his wife to wake up.

Ironically it is Matt who has to ""wake up."" He learns that his comatose wife had been ""seeing"" someone. With his wife's health deteriorating, Matt sets out to seek the truths about that guy, with his daughters and Alex's slacker friend Sid (Nick Krause) only to find unexpected consequences. And Matt has to make a grave decision about a tract of land in less than a week.

With the beautifully shot on-location photography in Hawaii, ""The Descendants"" sometimes looks like a visual travelogue, but the beautiful images sometime hide uncomfortable surprises and facts Matt didn't want to know. The film is part Matt's spiritual journey that is, skillfully told by the director, is amusing and touching at the same time without relying on conventional settings. It may not be all that uplifting, but overall optimistic.

The film is in a sense a character study of Matt (played superbly by George Clooney), but other characters are equally intriguing. While Alex tends to conceal what she really feels (like her father), her sister Scottie takes things as they seem and behaves accordingly. Looking at Matt and his daughters reminds us what we understand least is often someone very close to you.

To me, the strength of ""The Descendants"" lies in these characters whose emotions seem often unaccountable (even to those who possess them), but still genuine and realistic nonetheless. Alexander Payne explores how our life could be messy and painful - and also amazing - in his own unique style.",1355529600,28,2223,4.96505376344086

And with this thing blaring in your house for kids to hear, we wonder why they talk so filthy. Robert Forster could have been good, seemed to have phoned his performance in. This one didn't have any strong scenes, just kind of limped along to the end.

On the plus side the scenery was nice.",1350432000,,616,4.491071428571429
4473850,1,B004UXUX4Q,"""The Descendants"" is to great movies what packaged rice cakes are to fine dining.
With that said, I have to admit that this is a well-crafted film.  And because of its locale (Hawaii), visually interesting, too.  The acting is brilliant, as well.  Especially George Clooney in what had to be a challenging role.  I mean, he plays completely against the grain of what he really is: a handsome, confident movie actor.  And pulls it off magnificently.
The reason I so disliked this film, I think, is because I've seen one too many movies about angst.  Or, I should say more specifically, angst in characters I don't give a rat's patootie about.
Clooney plays an oblivious real estate attorney -- really more dork-like, I think, than oblivious -- whose family life disintegrated because of his habitual inability to see what really has been going on.  We're given to believe that he's been utterly clueless as to what his wife and kids have thought, needed and felt.  All because he was too absorbed in his ""fascinating"" law practice.  Or something.
Woven into that ""melodrama"" then, is also his status as the administrator of his huge family's (seemingly a hundred cousins) extensive island land holdings.  All of which seems comprised of the last of Hawaii's prime undeveloped real estate (and worth approaching a billion).  Which, naturally, his countless cousins start squabbling over when legal technicalities are about to force a liquidation.
Anyway, I just couldn't begin to care what happened to any character in ""The Descendants.""  At its ending, had Clooney been washed out to sea by a tsunami, my reaction would likely have been, ""Oh... that's one way to end it, I guess.""
In all fairness, this film deserves more than a single star (just on the acting alone).  But  because of my antipathy towards films featuring shallow, boring, self-absorbed characters, I'm going to go with my bias and rate it as I have.  I just couldn't get interested in people who had less  depth than a toddler's wading pool.",1350172800,2,2008,4.896449704142012

Soon we learn, his wife, spurned by Matt's long absences and indifference, was having an affair. Matt and his older daughter decide to search for this man they never met dragging along the younger girl and the oldest girl's boyfriend, and, of course, the viewer.

The Descendants has many things going for it. George Clooney, for one, beautiful views of two of the islands of Hawaii, a strong story that does not shy away from reality and avoids the sugarcoating so prevalent in Hollywood movies, and great acting from all the actors including the aforementioned Mr. Clooney.

Why? Because it is a realistic take on fatherhood and marriage and, after watching the trailer, I expected something lighter.

The characters in this film are flawed, yet they don't apologize, they move on and try and make things right. The director respects us enough not to spell everything out, especially with the ending.

4473988,1,B004UXUX4Q,"I watch a lot of films.  Like three or four a month.  In my opinion the most important part of film watching is believability.  You have to be able to immerse yourself into the film, almost becoming part of the plot yourself, and live the story with the characters, feeling the happy moments, the sad and hurt when the characters do.

That is what Descendants lack, believability.

The film starts with George Clooney sat at his wife's bedside whilst she is in a coma, with his voice over telling us how regretful he is of how he has lived his life and treated her up to that point and that he will get better and make up for his wrongs.  It sounded as insincere as a child saying sorry after stealing a cookie.  His blank expression on camera and monotone voice would keep most people comotose.

There are supposed to be comedy moments throughout the film - well if you count the extremely poor direction and wooden acting becoming increasingly laughable throughout the film, then yes, it's full of comedic gems.

The weird moment when the camera pans to the daughter finding out her Mum is not going to survive whilst she is swimming in the pool and she disappears under the water to have a cry.  Is that even possible without drowning?  I couldn't help but watch the screen in puzzlement.

And the weird boyfriend of the daughter, what was that all about?!  An odd character, but there was a refreshing moment when the Grandad punched him, everyone watching will feel a huge feeling of satisfaction when this happens, trust me.

George Clooney's wife was having an affair.  When his daughter told him this, he looked like he just found out he'd forgotten to feed the goldfish.  I don't know if this was not the type of acting George Clooney should be doing, or really bad direction.

And continuity...it's not difficult surely?  If you pan to an actor in a coma and they have their mouth open, make sure in the next shot from a different angle it's still open.  That's got to be one of the first lessons in film making school right?

This film does do something I never thought possible, it beat The Cube as the worst film ever.  And that's hard work.

So if you're still hovering over the 'buy' button after reading my review, buy a copy of Ocean's Eleven as well to watch straight after this film to remind yourself that George Clooney is where he is in the film industry for a reason...and that's not for Descendants.",1343088000,,2423,4.52183908045977

But this performance was low-key and played perfectly.  I enjoyed every aspect of the flick which is something I can't say for most of the nominated movies, especially War Horse (yuck).

The Descendants losing out to the Artist leaves me with the same feeling I had when Fargo lost out to The English Patient, and Avatar lost out to The Hurt Locker.  Pure travesty.  As I've said numerous times, a great movie will stand the test of time.  The Descendants, Avatar, and Fargo are great movies.

4473992,2,B004UXUX4Q,"THE DESCENDANTS got a lot of press around awards time, and it deserved none of the accolades it received. I don't know if critics thought they had to like it since it came from Oscar winning director Alexander Payne, or if it was because it started Hollywood Golden Boy George Clooney, or if it because it had a nice, sweet, anti-business message. For whatever reason, critics got it wrong. It's unfortunate that this movie is a total bore, except for Sid (Nick Krause) and possibly Julie Speer (Judy Greer), the slacker boyfriend, because the story is a good one.

The plot is simple. A man (Matt King, Clooney) is caring for his wife who is in a coma. He discovers she was cheating on him. She is going to die. King has to cope with losing his wife, and never getting to confront her about her cheating. He also gets a chance to meet the man who she was cheating with. The movie had all sorts of opportunities to create a story about forgiveness and reconciliation. Or, it could have gone darker and crafted a story of revenge and bitterness. Instead, it takes the approach of apathy. I'm not saying King or his two daughters (the non-entity Scotty, or the foul mouthed, cute 18-year old Alex) don't care about their mom or her cheating ways. I'm saying that the viewers have no reason to care. Perhaps one of the reason I cared so little is because of the stupid side story about the descendants. It seems King and his numerous cousins have descended from Hawaiian royalty and they face a big decision on who they should sell some property to and make millions. That story line added nothing to the plot.

If this movie hadn't been lauded as one of the best of the year, I would have enjoyed it. Instead, I'm tired of watching movies Hollywood claims to be good and being bored out of my mind.  I remember reading a story about Matthew Lillard, who plays the man the wife cheats with, Brian Speer. It made it sound like his part mattered in the movie. But it didn't. He was hardly on screen at all. He didn't matter. Just like this movie. It doesn't matter.",1342051200,3,2060,4.458885941644563

Clooney has made quite a few good films in the last several years and I am glad to see that he is not loosing his stream.  His performance is wonderful, but movie itself falls a little short.

It is a story about the man who is native Hawaiian and lives somewhat modest life compared to the wealth he inherited.  He is a lawyer, specializing in real estate in charge of the land trust that his family owns.  On the surface is life is perfect: he has nice law practice, wife and two daughters.  One day tragedy hits home and his wife ends up in a coma.  It is during her hospitalization that he discovers she had a well kept secret from him that changes his entire outlook on life, marriage and family.

Like any encounter with death, family members need closure with the person that is dying.  This family goes through that process with close family members, friends and grief councelors. No matter how difficult the truth is for this man who is loosign his wife of nearly 20 years, he pulls through it and carries on with whatever is left.  It is the story of endurance, during most difficult times and story of a family capable of finding their peace once the trauma of loosing one of their own is over.",1341532800,,1306,4.381742738589212

4474042,5,B004UXUX4Q,"This ""dramedy"" (a comedy with dramatic moments) was well received by the critics, attaining  an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as two Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture - Drama and Best Actor - Drama for George Clooney (the main character of this picture). It won a number of lesser known awards so I'm not kidding when I tell you the critics loved it.

So what's it about? Focus on Hawaii and a guy named Matt (Clooney) who runs a steady real estate law practice and is also the executor for a huge chunk of land worth millions to developers. It has been in the family for generations (hence the title) and most of Matt's relatives want to sell the land and make millions. Matt is going along with it but part of him wonders if they're doing a disservice to later generations in the family.

But the real catalyst is when Matt's wife has a major boating accident and is in the hospital with a coma and Matt believes she is going to come out of it and then the doctor tells him it isn't going to happen and he needs to tell the whole family that she will be dead soon. That's when the poignant moments come into this movie which are most likely the major reason it was so well received by the critics. Add to that a dysfunctional family with secrets and you start to see everything unravel but you also get these strange moments where you can't help laughing or maybe laughing but still feeling their pain. At one point Matt tells his eldest daughter that their mother isn't going to make it (he does it clumsily at best) and the daughter submerges into the pool holding her breathe and the camera spends an inordinate amount of time focused on her facial grief. She comes up out of the pool and starts to walk away from her father not wanting to share her pain with a family member you would think she would want to do so with but that just reinforces the dysfunctional actions of this family.

Minor spoiler coming up so stop reading if you want to go in totally blind and already know you will see this picture. Matt's eldest daughter, who is at that difficult teenager/young adult transition, tells him that his wife was cheating on him with some real estate agent (she doesn't known his name or location). As to be expected this sends Matt into an emotional meltdown and you get to see him in this undignified moment in which he's running in his boat shoes down a road to confront the best friend of his wife to find out who the cheater is and where he lives. What follows is a journey with his two daughters and a guy friend of the eldest named Sid to confront the real estate man but to also come to terms with their grief, unsaid words to the mother/wife in a coma and their overall place in the universe. This is a definite soul searching movie on several levels. People who watch this casually and don't appreciate the poignant moments will wonder what all the fuss was about.

Sid is arguably and surprisingly the closest echo character to Matt. There are a few moments of clarity in which they have these revealing conversations. That said, he's kind of an insensitive jerk at times so I enjoyed it when he got face punched by Matt's father-in-law. The eldest daughter lashes out in her rage at times, especially towards what her mother has done to the family, and the youngest daughter knows something is wrong so she goes off into dramatic situations to get attention.

Themes about forgiveness versus vengeance when your spouse cheats on you are obvious. What type of person would you be and the film suggests you really do not know until it happens. Additionally, there's a definite thematic focus on how weird family can sometimes get with large sums of money as well as how a family can still be a family even though it's noticeably dysfunction (if the psychological stats are correct well over half of American families are dysfunctional).

Based on a novel of the same name by  Kaui Hart Hemmings. The budget for this film was $20M and it made a bit over $82M at the Box Office. Clooney's performance, subtle at times, pumps up the quality of this picture.

In the past, Payne so worked over his cliches that they were no longer cliches; he mined their essential reality and revealed them to us in ways that seemed new.

4474098,2,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants.  What does that say to you?  Somehow I missed everything about this movie, trailers and reviews, except for the part of it being shot in Hawaii.  I had no idea what to expect, although someone wrote it was like ""every other George Clooney movie"".  I can't say either way, even after seeing it.  To me, the title could be for a Sci-Fi Horror flick, where the Descendants are those of Martians who impregnated women five generations ago, and now, after passing from womb to female child from generation to generation, they're ready to pop out, after devouring the living woman in the most gory fashion, of course, and terrorize the audience for the next ninety minutes, and four sequels.  Or something.

This movie is not that movie.  It could probably use a better title.  It opens with a panoramic shot of Diamond Head and Waikiki environs, shot from a tower or hillside house near Punchbowl, or thereabouts.  Then there's a shot of a nice blonde woman in a speeding boat.  One gets the impression this boat ride went bad, but one never sees it.  Instead, George Clooney's voice, sounding bitter, is talking about living in paradise and how everyone seems to think that makes life better.  Instead, he asks (and I paraphrase) ""does that make our diseases less fatal?  Our families less screwed up?"".  Yep, the whole film set up right there.  It turns out that the pretty lady in the boat is Clooney's wife, and she fell out of boat and is in a coma.  She's going to die, that's not the focus of the movie, as she left a living will, so we'll move along.  I can't tell you what happens, but I can say the marriage was not going well, George spent too much time in the office;  there are two daughters, one of which looks more Hawaiian than anybody else in the film, which begs the question, who was HER father?  The older daughter has a cave man for a boyfriend, or at least that's what you think until Grandpa, father of the dying woman, punches him.  Yep, you can't tell the kids from the adults these days.  So there are family issues.

But, the Family, is also a trust, holding 25000 acres of pristine Kauai ocean front property, and the trust will expire in seven years.  Fear Not.  The movie does not cover even one year.  So, they're meeting to talk about selling the land.  The sale will make them all filthy rich, and some of them need the money.  At this point it's worth pointing out that the trust dates back over 100 years, to A Real Hawaiian Princess (we thought Hollywood was over this enchantment with native princesses, but apparently not).  She was a direct descendant of King Kamehameha, but she married a haole (a white dude, although the word, like Gringo, originally meant stranger, and was first used on the Chinese) and that's how we can have a movie set in Hawaii with almost no Hawaiians in it.  Or Filipinos, Chinese, etc etc.  (For those of you who are pineapple starved:  King Kam unified the islands under his rule in the 18th century.  The caboose end of that dynasty was King Kalakaua, who blew the wad on two world tours and a grand marriage based on that of Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie, who at least had an empire to pay for it).

So, once we establish that A) Mom Is Going To DIe.  and that B) We Must Sell The Land (we think).  The only thing left to do is to find out what they do with the land, and how George will react to the news that his nest has been invaded by a real estate geek---I'm sure the actor is a real nice guy, but if you already have George Clooney, would you really be going after a geek?  I suppose so, but I don't like it.

The older daughter and her boyfriend are developed nicely.  The little girl remains something of a pet human.  The cousins, aunts and uncles, are nothing but talking background, and Dad In Law is the Character.  George Clooney plays the sort of fatherly role once played by Fred MacMurray and Robert Young (if you don't know who they are, you ARE young, and aren't missing much, but you should ask around from time to time, in case you miss the start of the war) and while he's quite sympathetic and likeable, we never really get to know him.  No one ever seems to realize that it is HIS wife who is comatose, despite their failings.  I think the movie would have been better with a bit more of a focus on him, along with the daughters.

In the end, given that the impetus of the film is set by the dying woman, once she's gone and all the questions are answered, about her and the land (it's on his side, not hers) you've pretty much had the experience.  Watch it again?  Maybe.  I'm not so sure.  I give stars as much for watchability in reruns, and three stars is a movie I'd buy, or already own.  I give this a two.  It's a run of the mill dying person story, sharing the plot with a family business drama, and minus the Love quotient that would have made the dying part sufficient to carry the film.  So, while it's worth a first try, I'd put it half way down your list with a view towards a hurricane evacuation;  a very rainy day, or when you're snowed in, next winter.  Set in a nice Sonoma red and some cheese and do it in style.",1337817600,,5149,4.3539915966386555

The sad (and often pathetic) circumstances throughout this movie are not really all that heartfelt, do not really make much of a point, and are overly repetitious. Clooney's wife is in a coma, His daughters are unruly (the youngest wants to watch porn!?), and he spends the majority of the movie chasing after the man his wife had an affair with so that he can release his anger on him, and then invite him to see his wife before her passing. He and his eldest daughter both yell psychotically at the comatose wife, which seems senseless considering the circumstances. The eldest daughter's boyfriend is criticized throughout the movie by Clooney's character and the father-in-law though it is clear that he is not portrayed to be a lesser-than figure. The behavior and responses by characters in the movie are childish, and for the most part, unnecessary. The large chunk of Hawaiian land inherited from ancestors, which Clooney's character considers selling, is only a backdrop in the movie which isn't really referenced all that much. Not that it would have been more interesting otherwise, but the title doesn't really fit. The movie is much more focused on behavioral and situational issues such as to what I've already mentioned.

George Clooney plays a husband stricken by the grief of his comatose wife, only to find out she was having an affair.

Is it any good?

Alexander Payne of Sideways fame has crafted another brilliant character driven piece, where you don't know whether you want to laugh or cry...or both. George Clooney is amazing as the highly strung man, dealing with not only his wife, but his dysfunctional family. His performance was very worthy of an Oscar Nomination and probably should have won. With so many formulaic films now days, it is certainly refreshing to watch something that is original and genuinely uncertain as to how it would end. It's ironic that initially the film baulks at showing Hawaii only as the `tourist mecca' we have all seen, but by the end it returns to scenery we all know and love, painting a picture of paradise. This is arguably the best film of 2011.

George travels to a douchebag real estate mogul's holiday home to confront him about his relationship with his wife.

NOTE:  THIS REVIEW HAS NO SPOILERS!

What a sad, sweet movie.

Discovering your wife is/was having an affair while also being confronted by the fact that her recent injury has left her in a completely vegetative state, and that the plug needs to be pulled--how do you deal with that?  And all of this is added to the fact that you`ve really screwed up raising your kids, and that burden is now yours alone to bear.

""The Descendants"" stars George Clooney, an actor increasingly proving his depth as a portrayer of wounded souls.  Here he is Matt King, a man who is getting pressured from all sides.  He is the sole trustee of a beautiful virgin Hawaiian lagoon that most of his numerous family line want to sell to a developer.  His is the deciding vote--and the trust will expire in seven years.

First, however, must come his family, and to truly care for it he must give up his role as the ""back-up parent"" and learn how to deal with two foreign species: his two daughters, Scottie (10) and Alex (17).  Both need attention, as each is going in her own misguided direction.

Scottie is acting out in school, texting inappropriate messages in school, including insults and disturbing photos of her dying mother, and Alex is at her expensive boarding school, drinking, carousing, and filled with unresolved anger toward her mother.  And she prefers to hang out with her friend Sid, a young surfer-type whose favorite word is ""dude.""

Matt has a load on his shoulders that no one would want to bear, and in fact there is more going on than I've included here, as I don't want to provide ""spoilers.""  What is important now is his coming to terms with these problems, and doing so in a manner that will allow others to get on with their own lives.  There were times I cringed while watching, wondering if this movie was just too beleaguered to watch--but I'm very glad I stuck with it.

That Matt's last name is ""King"" is no mistake; he is indeed the patriarch of the family when it comes to this trust, and his decision regarding it will not only affect those who live, but also those who have passed on--the trust consists of 25,000 acres of land that has been in the family ever since the early 1800s when it belonged to relatives who were actual royalty on the island of Kaua'i.

""The Descendants,"" therefore, is an aptly named movie, and during this movie we will find out just how much this responsibility means to Matt.

As I said, I found this at first to be a difficult movie to watch, but increasingly easier as the plot draws you in.  What especially works is the relationship Matt has with his older daughter, Alex, and her acceptance of her role as the matriarch, if you will.  She has things to work out on her own, and it is her growth that better enables Matt to hang on.  She has a directness to her that is initially off-putting, but becomes both comforting and compelling as time goes on, and is wise that her father listens to her...she becomes a worth ally.

This is a thoughtful, gripping movie about love, and forgiveness, and anger, and redemption.  I found it to be smart but not too clever, and I believed in the characters and the story and the decisions that were ultimately reached.  I thought the acting was terrific, and apparently so did many others...especially those in charge of year-end awards.

""The Descendants"" was either nominated for or won most key movie awards, from the Oscars to the American Film Institute to the Golden Globes and on and on.  It is a good film, extremely well made and heartfelt.  Clooney's performance alone is worth seeing and he was likewise honored this year with several nominations.

However, I felt particularly glad that Shailene Woodley was also honored for her performance as Alex--I truly thought she stood out in a movie where everyone was great.",1337472000,,3820,4.594395280235989
4474129,5,B004UXUX4Q,"This is a brilliantly written movie about family, and ancestors.  If you have not seen it, you should.  I loved it on the big screen and can't wait to add it to my home collection too!

When I say it's about family and ancestors, it's not just about where your from or traditions.  It's more about that, while the main actor's (George Clooney) wife is in the hospital on her death bed, and raising their two children (one in colllege, and the other a teenager), is also an Executor of an estate he shares with his many sibling's in Hawaii.

Decisions have to be made by Clooney in both his wife's life in which he learns of a relationship that he never knew, and also a decision that affects his sibling's and future generations as well.

4474168,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The Deascendants is worth seeing for a number of reasons: good story, excellent values, filmed in Hawaii, but, above, all because Clooney is now a fully matured actor, playing a father with a wife in a coma, two daughters--one rebellious--and a host of cousins who pressure him to sell a piece of land, a beautiful beach inherited from Hawaiian natives, to turn into condos on the beach, and large revenues. He stays calm, nurtures his daughters to health, and sees himself as a keeper of the flame, with reverence to his past.

4474170,5,B004UXUX4Q,"A lot of people don't like this movie because of the way the daughters spoke to their father. NEWS FLASH!: That's how MOST kids talk to their parents now and the people who are angry at it are probably the ones that live their lives that way. Don't act like it's not happening! I didn't like it, but that's how parents are raising their kids to talk to them now and they're all in denial like they have these really good kids. That's one of the reasons why I was able to watch it and enjoy it because it was showing people for what they truly are.

So many movies try and gloss over people's actual personalities and try and come across like the Cleavers, but most families are far far from anything like that. And so are people. Get over it and stop acting like it doesn't happen because it does.

Now, as far as this movie goes, I liked it because it was different, but I loved it because of the acting and the writing. I loved it because it was shot beautifully. And I loved it because it told so many different stories in 2 hours. I just thought it was being truthful. Everyone wants to act as if mothers are just the best when it comes to movies, that they don't screw up, that they're strong now and beautiful and we're all going to die loved. That's just not true. People might love you and despise you all at the same time.

I loved this film, but I can understand how some people may not get it and I can't knock them for that. But this deserved all the attention it got in my opinion.",1336694400,,1494,4.162629757785467

4474173,5,B004UXUX4Q,"I cried off and on throughout this movie, and I am not usually one to appreciate that (I prefer movies that offer escapism) but in this case it was worth it to me. This movie is just so well-written and acted that I was willing to go through the experience. And in a way it is about anti-escapism, set as it is in Hawaii, with George Clooney's character bitterly noting in the opening voiceover that his friends on the mainland think his life must be heaven, living in paradise as he does, but don't they realize that people still suffer, and break each other's hearts, and die?

For those who don't know, the plot of this movie (although 'plot' is not quite the right word) is that Clooney's character's wife is in a coma, and soon to be dead. He has to deal with this, and the reality of their troubled marriage which he will now never get to save, along with explaining it to his troubled daughters, ages 10 and 17, other family members, and friends. There is also a backstory involving valuable land his family owns, and is considering selling. I don't want to give everything away, but the essence is that this is a rich and quirky cast of characters, where no one is perfect and everyone is struggling to understand what is happening and how to connect, and forgive.

The writing, the acting, the tone and the filming are all exactly right. It's a real film about real people, with no special effects, and grounded in the realities of life - both the harshest and most beautiful realities - and that makes it very special, and well-worth the praise it has received.",1336262400,,1571,4.489510489510489

4474188,5,B004UXUX4Q,"In the tradition of ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and ""Ordinary People,"" ""The Descendants"" is a high-toned social drama centered around the complex dynamics of familial relationships. Like those other films, it also won wide critical praise and a boatload of award nominations the year it was released.

Matt King is a wealthy, workaholic businessman living in Hawaii with his wife and two daughters, the older of whom is a rebellious teen who's recently been shipped off to boarding school on another island. As the movie opens, we learn that Matt's world has begun to crash in on him big time as his wife lies in a coma brought on by a boating accident. Matt struggles not only with the guilt of having been an emotionally distant husband but with raising two precocious and challenging children, who are deep in the throes of typical growing pains and whom he barely seems to know at this point. He also has to deal with the complications of selling some of the valuable property he inherited from his wealthy ancestors to developers who may not be as attuned as he is to the natural beauty and ecological richness of the land.

With a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by Nat Faxon, Jim Rash and director Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, the movie neatly sidesteps all the potential melodrama inherent in the material. The plot constantly wanders off onto interesting and unexpected bypaths, and characters who seem as if they could become easily pigeonholed refuse to do or say what we expect them to do or say. No one is a hero or a villain; they're all just ordinary folks trying to lead decent lives, though often falling far short of that mark, as we all do. Indeed, there is an air of verisimilitude to this film that is a rare commodity in modern commercial moviemaking. At every moment, we feel as if are watching real people acting in real ways - just as if actual life were unfolding before us. In fact, there is not a single false moment to be found anywhere in the film.

This is thanks, in no small measure, to George Clooney who has never given a truer or more deeply vulnerable performance than he does here, utilizing his innate good-guy persona to astonishing effect. Ditto for Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller who play his two daughters with unerring believability and conviction. Their interactions with one another are indeed a wonder to behold.

With admirable restraint, director Alexander Payne is content to let the drama speak for itself. He has the decency to pull back and give the characters their space without feeling it necessary to push his points or exploit the audience's emotions. Yet, there is a lovely, hypnotic flow to the movie that draws us into both the tropical setting (how many movies set in Hawaii are about people who actually live there?) and the lives of these ordinary people who are suffering through an extraordinary - yet, at the same time, utterly universal - ordeal.

A human drama that is as intimate as it is epic, ""The Descendants"" is one of the most profound and moving film-going experiences of recent years.",1336089600,,3091,4.748603351955308

4474192,5,B004UXUX4Q,"A strange film indeed echoing The Tree of Life. Has the West in its vast financial, debt and economic crisis become absolutely morbid when having to face the loss of its hegemony in the world? I believe so and there are two attitudes possible.

Either you refuse it and you get angry and you start accusing everyone and the whole world of some kind of plot against you, like in Greece and you burn the central public library. That's the choice of the wife of the lover of the dying wife-mother-daughter-cousin-relative of the main male character marvellously rendered by Clooney.

Or you start taming your anger and looking beyond this narrow-minded reaction and you try to come to terms with the situation, with death, with an affair, with so many things that should not prevent life from going on. Because life has to go on, even in Spain, Italy, Ireland, France and elsewhere in this Western world.

And the choice is personal and has to be negotiated in the film by a middle-aged widowed husband and father; by a teenage daughter that had difficult relations with the mother; by a young daughter who is still a child and does not even know what death is; by the lover who loved or did not love but used the wife before her death and implanted in her some mirage; by the wife of that occasional and indelicate lover; by the members of the fund that is supposed to take care of a big chunk of one of the Hawaiian islands, a territory that is still virginal and is greedily desired by some real estate developer whose brother in law is the indelicate lover; by so many other people around that comatose woman who signed her will to be unplugged if she was to get into such a situation.

Parting from the dying, nearly dead person is always difficult and Clooney and his fellow actors or family members play that drama, that painful trauma with the dignity and the restraint necessary to make it poignant without making it melodramatic. Just for that reason you should see that film and enjoy it. Take it as a good preparation for the traumas, personal, national or universal, that may happen tomorrow at sunrise, if not before.

It is not the Tree of Life, but the Tree of Death that goes on growing beyond death because Death is Life and Life never stopped in front of Death.

4474194,4,B004UXUX4Q,"I found this movie engrossing.

Alexander Payne once again tells a story of everyday life and in a just under two hours lets the viewer consider a variety of emotions from different character's perspectives.

Clooney was an interesting choice as the very emotionally distant father to his two daughters. To be honest, I think he was too extreme and bordered on non-believable. Perhaps his lack of experience as a father was difficult for him to grasp the sincere empathy that the role required.

Shailene Woodley was tremendous for a 21 year old with little movie experience. She was able to bring the pain, hurt, rage and sense of loss all to the screen. I hope we see more of her.

Hawaii as the backdrop to the movie was inspired. It's tranquility and beauty in complete contrast to the emotional drama being played out in the foreground. I quite liked how one reviewer suggested Hawaii was in fact another character in the movie.

So some excellent acting, a script and plot that allows the viewer to ""participate"" in the emotions played out on screen, made this a very thoughtful and strong drama.",1335657600,,1102,4.7486910994764395

Alexander Payne goes to great lengths to make Matt feel ordinary, confronted with his wife's untimely accident and the sale of the estate.  Clooney plays his character like a less dashing Miles from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intolerable-Cruelty/dp/B0026IYLQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intolerable Cruelty</a>, trading in his Armani suits for Hawaiian shirts and flip flops.

Shailene Woodley steals the show, as Matt's plucky teenage daughter who helps him sort through his failings and try to repair what's left of the family, as her mother is kept alive on a respirator.  Her boyfriend Sid provides a handful of comic moments, but otherwise seems rather useless.  Amara Miller as young Scottie King appears at first to be a major part of the story, but is all too quickly pushed to the sidelines in favor of her big sister.  From this nuclear family we meet the extended King family, which once ruled Hawaii in colonial times, Kauai anyway.

Although this film received the Oscar for Best Screenplay, it was robbed of Best Director, Best Actor and Best Film. This movie follows the book very closely, at times, word for word. It is skillfully directed, and blended into what is easily George Clooney's finest performance of his career. The cinematography is crisp and has great lighting, unlike other films that are too light or overly dark. Having the story take place in Hawaii helps too.

The scenery is fresh and tells the story with unique twists. The performances of all the main characters is first rate. It is a contemporary film of the present day so language can be explicit and it is geared for adult audiences, not for young children. There has been enough written about the plot from the book. The film does alter certain aspects of the novel, but it is skillfully accomplished without damaging the overall theme. The Blu-ray delivers a crisp and clear product, you will be pleased with the visual energy. You may want to bring a hanky, it touches the emotions on several different levels. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller, who play Clooney's daughters turn in some top-notch performances. The character of Sid is also noteworthy.

4474267,5,B004UXUX4Q,"Matt King (George Clooney) lives in paradise but he couldn't be farther from paradise than he is at this moment. He sits in a hospital room where his wife lies in a coma after a horrific boating accident that occurred off of Waikiki Beach. He goes home to care for his 10 year old daughter that he rarely has been with because of his travels and work load. His daughter is an out of control foul mouthed brat who has no respect for anyone. His older 17 year old daughter is in a private boarding school and she is even more ill-tempered and disrespectful.

Matt was so involved in his life as a lawyer and the fact that he was the caretaker of the family's trust fund of billions of dollars of pristine land in Hawaii that he rarely had time for his family. Now he is seeing the results of his self-centered life and he is facing the consequences.

When he tries to tell his older daughter that her mom is severely injured she tells him that she doesn't care. She has hated her mom since their big fight at Christmas. She tells her dad that she caught her mom cheating on him with another man and that he had no clue what was going on.....

This is a tragic story of a dysfunctional family faced with the potential loss of their wife and mother and having no relationship with each other. Matt who wants to blame his wife for having an affair, realizes that if she had been happy then she would not have cheated. If he had been a better father then his daughters would be more respectful and loving.

How they cope with the pending loss and with each other is an endearing story of human relationships and failures. The saga is a sad story of lost loves and lost family members and of trying to rebuild a normal life. In the end Matt realizes that no matter what has happened, he loves his wife and his daughters more than ever. Perhaps there is a chance for some happiness after all!

We enjoyed this movie and felt that it was very good. It is a good lesson that life is not about money and riches but of the love and the relationships you have with your family and friends. I believe you will like this movie. It is well acted and the storyline is very good.

Nothing can touch the following words of Matt to his wife:

George Clooney plays against type as a clueless father and husband with baggy eyes and a beaten-down face.  He slouches through the story and generally looks pretty ordinary. He's good in the role, but not good enough to save the movie.  My first problem with it is the constant profanity used by the two young daughters; it's off-putting, to say the least.  Second, the story is a real downer, dealing with death, infidelity, and family struggles.  Third, it's relentlessly tedious, so monotonously depressing that it gets old fast.

4474316,3,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants is a successful production. The acting was very good. The pace for the type of story told was reasonable. The emotional journey was engaging. The ending was fair enough. The music track exceptional. I think many people have liked and will like this film.

There were several points about the film that made me wonder why the film was received so well. Matt King finds that his comatose wife had been having an affair. He decides to find her lover and invite him to come to the hospital to say good bye to Matt's wife. He goes to great lengths to find him. I'm willing to go along with a character as developed, but this notion defies my reading of the world. I don't think there's more than a man in a thousand who would do this. And there was no reason, no foundation to expect that Matt King would either. Much of the film pivots on this preposterous idea.

Second, characters are shown visiting the comatose wife and mother for the purpose of yelling at her about how bad she was as a person. If she could hear what was said, it was utterly cruel to put her through these tirades, her being unable to correct the record or even apologize. It wasn't funny and I couldn't sympathize with the complainants. They went too far, all of them. If she could not hear them, what was the point? They were just having tantrums. Not appealing or entertaining.

SPOILER
In the end, the wife's lover is discovered and confronted. Matt King invites him to come say good-bye to his wife. The man chooses not to make that visit, but his own wife does. She brings her flowers. Really? Look, with proper development, any character can justifiably be made to do about anything. But this is not the case with this angry, hurt wife. She asks to speak with the comatose woman, which is pretty absurd in itself. She proceeds to ""forgive"" her in a tirade that fails to hide her angry resentments. The lady was not portrayed as mentally unstable, quite the opposite, so this scene seems so very, very improbable...and it's cruel, once again.

In spite of all this, one feels oddly moved by the movie. The circumstances themselves beg for such a response, wife and mother dying before amends can be made, the finality of death in the bloom of life and such. Emotionality carried the day. So it succeeds despite all these glaring faults. Strange thing.",1334707200,,2342,4.555819477434679

There are many synopses of the film, so read another review for the plotline.  With Alexander Payne at the helm and George Clooney in the lead, I had very high expectations for this film.  The actual product even exceeded those expectations.  The characters drawn full and as we humans are, flawed.  I especially liked that the youngest child didn't fall into the cute and precocious trap that is the usual timeworn device for such.  The plotline is well-crafted and avoids the obvious cliches that this story could have easily fallen into.  The dialog is just about perfect.  These people talk like well, ""real people.""

There are a couple of hallmarks of the Alexander Payne films that I have seen that again are evident in this film.  One, very quickly the viewer knows who the characters are - I mean really KNOWS who these people are.  Payne is able carry this through many of the supporting characters as well.  I don't know how he does it, but his characters are established to the viewer very soon after they first appear.  The other thing Payne does is create almost unbelievable situations and make them seem feasible.  If we saw them written in a story or saw them realized in less-adroit hands, some of his plotlines would be laughable - and not in a good way. In Payne's hands, we simply accept them because he makes them so plausable within the context of the storyline.

One of the most genius moves was to place this story in Hawaii. Against a backdrop most would consider the destination of a lifetime, yes, the denizens have the same problems, the same heartbreaks, the same joys those of us living in less-stunning settings do.

There are some movies that I enjoy as I would an old friend, welcoming them back again and again.  The Descendants is on its way of entering that elite group.",1334534400,,1903,4.613095238095238

4474351,4,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants is Alexander Payne's first movie since Sideways in 2004.  Much like its predecessor, The Descendants deftly mixes pain and humor with snappy script that won Mr. Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash a best adapted screenplay Oscar.  George Clooney stars as Matt King who is a real estate lawyer in Honolulu and a direct descendant of Hawaiian royalty.  He is the trustee of a family trust that owns 25,000 acres of pristine land on the island of Kauai that his family is looking to sell before the trust expires.  While this is happening, his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is left in a coma after a boating accident.  He refers to himself as the back-up parent to his two daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alex (Shailene Woodley).  He now has to step up as a full-time father. After taking Alex home from her private school, she tells him that Elizabeth was having an affair.  This sends Matt's world spiraling even more out of control.  The rest of film deals with Matt trying to find his wife's lover and the selling of the land.  Mr. Clooney shows his versatility as an actor playing Matt as a beaten down man trying to rise to the occasion.  He received a well deserved best actor nomination.  Ms. Woodley is a real find.  She could have played the part as much more of a caricature of a screwed up teen, but she adds real depth to the role.  The scenery as one would expect is gorgeous and the pacing of the film is just right.

As Matt King ( Clooney) tries to face the death of his wife due to an accident  with his younger daughter Scottie ( Amara Miller) and cope with the rebelliousness of his teen daughter Alexandra. He also has to decide the sale of prime real estate in Hawaii to developer, and the sale is causing his family to become even more hostile. If this is not enough, he comes to realise that his comatose wife was having an affair behind his back. The movie is easy to watch and is lit by wonderful performances by Sid (Nick Krause), Alexandra's friend; Matthew Lillard as Brian, the wife's lover; Judy Greer as Brian's sweet-wife; Robert Forster as Matt's  father-in-law.
Alexander Payne, finding his form again after ` Sideways"" allows all these people bare their emotions and act wonderfully while doing, amidst the backdrop of beautifully shot Hawaii.

The movie begins with Elizabeth, the hated woman of the movie, water skiing, and ending up in a coma at a Hawaiian hospital on life support.  The whole movie (which is supposedly about an impending land deal) really revolves around the dying woman's broken relationships with her family.  Her husband walks into the hospital room and rails on his pitiful-looking, dying wife for the awful life she gave him, in the most foul-mouthed sort of way.

4474389,1,B004UXUX4Q,"George Clooney.  I'll never understand the appeal.  I take that back.  I get it, to a degree, and I even buy into it, to a degree.  I just feel that the world, much like with Johnny Depp, is too late to this party.  I mean, back in the 90's, Depp was amazing.  When does the world take notice?  When he stars in that Disney `pirate' movie.  Back in the early aughts, Clooney was starring in quality films with varying subjects and smart directors who knew how to use him.  When does the world embrace him?  When he gets obnoxiously political and starts starring in a slew of pretentious films pretending to be smart.

And I thought `Up in the Air' was bad.

`The Descendants', as expected, was high on Oscar's radar.  They love Clooney now.  Sadly, this film is a complete misstep in that it just appears so surface; so miniscule.  It is trying to say so much about family and heritage and the preservation of both (literally and then again figuratively portrayed by the Hawaiian landscape).  Instead of getting into the heart of it though, `The Descendants' throws a slew of unlikable characters at us and expects us to weed through their flaws to find ourselves.  I've never in my life wanted to hit so many people.  Sadly, Alexander Payne forgot how to make movies.  I mean, `Sideways' and `About Schmidt', while not perfect, were really well done films  that haunted in certain ways.  With this film, Payne merely resorts to layering his ill-conceived drama with a bunch of poorly executed `monologues' that are supposed to amount to something in the end but wind up amounting to a lot of hot air.

The film tells the story of Matt King, a lawyer who is trustee to a lot of beautiful land his family left to him and his cousins.  His cousins (or at least most of them) want to sell the land and make a fortune.  Matt is old school and believes in working for his money and so he deprives his family of an overtly rich life.  He has lost touch with his wife, who has been having an affair behind his back and planned on leaving him.  His eldest daughter is wayward and his youngest daughter is confused.  Oh, and his wife was in a severe accident and is on life support.  This obiovusly makes him reflect on his life and go soul searching (sort of) and blah blah blah.

Shailene Woodley is rather excellent here, but the rest of the cast is so uneven.  Clooney is wooden and somewhat phones this in.  Amara Miller is annoying.  I wanted to run Nick Krause over with my car (seriously, a film trying to be this poignant should not resort to such depths of stereotypical clichs).  What is Matthew Lillard doing in this movie?  Judy Greer seemed promising and then she had that ridiculous outburst in the hospital that made me laugh out loud.

UGH, and this won an Oscar!  Seriously, the script is really skeletal and needed so much more fleshing out to make it feel well rounded.  Instead, this just became so faux important.  I hate that Clooney picks these films that attempt to be taken seriously but say so little about the subject they are pretending to know so much about.

And if you have to basically read us the book through voice over narration during the film's opening ten minutes just to get us on track with the film then maybe you should rethink your scripting approach.",1334275200,20,3286,4.486486486486487

4474406,5,B004UXUX4Q,"George Clooney is more than just a pretty face.

Just in case you didn't already know that, see The Descendants. In my opinion, this is the best film he's made to date. Clooney is a movie star who can still morph into a character, unlike some movie stars who come across on screen as movie stars just playing someone else (Tom Cruise, I'm talking about you). In this film, he's a lawyer named Matt King whose risk-taking wife is on life support, having been critically injured in a water skiing accident. He's also dealing with two daughters, both having trouble coping with their mother's absence.

Then he finds out his wife had been having an affair and was planning to leave him. As he searches for answers, he struggles to hold his family together, spearhead the sale of his family's ancestral land, and eventually make a decision as to whether or not to keep his wife on life support. When he sets out to find and confront the real estate broker his wife was seeing, with his daughters and eldest daughter Alex's dopey friend Sid in two, the family begins to bond.

Clooney, a confirmed bachelor in real life, is spot-on as a husband and father here. As his daughters, Alex and Scottie, Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are also wonderful. I especially liked Nick Krause as Alex's always inappropriate friend Sid. This guy was a genius when it came to ticking people off. Beau Bridges is good, as always, as one of Matt's cousins, Hugh, a long-haired, Hawaiian-shirted land baron.

But the real star of this movie is Hawaii, and never has it looked more beautiful. The cinematography shows off the lush paradise to the max, providing such a stunning backdrop for the family's turmoil that you'll run, not walk, to your nearest travel agent.

I confess: I've been a fan of George Clooney's ever since he played Sela Ward's love interest in the late '80s TV series Sisters...but this actor isn't getting older, he's getting better. Much better.",1334102400,,1949,4.720588235294118

In 5 months the movie has made about $83M in the States, and $171M worldwide, so it's been a success, if that sort of thing impresses us, really.... As the ""cute clown"", Clooney is entertaining, but when served up with a side-order of slice-of-life human angst, Clooney is kind of boring to many of us who also have a Y-chromosome.

Anytime Clooney wants to make a pile of money, all he has to do is shave, get dressed up, and appear in another ""Ocean's""-style movie. The women will follow him in hordes... at the theater, and on election day, where this well-known liberal Democrat serves as one of Obama's ""high priests"".

The film is another reminder that Clooney is one of the best actors of this generation--Matt's character has to make a tough decision about the land deal as well as handle thorny, complicated family relationships, and Clooney is just perfect in the role.  Woodley is outstanding in her role as well, and with her beauty and acting ability she should be a huge star in years to come.

""The Descendants"" is a well-acted drama that has believable characters attempt to deal with believable problems, but is not without a couple of funny moments as well.

This is a clever movie that accesses your emotions that somehow, when put together, are less common that other movie experiences.

The words said at the beginning of the movie, is what captured me. (paraphrasing) ""People think Hawaii is a paradise. What they don't realize is that the people there are not on a perpetual vacation. They have lives too with just as much hurt and pain as you.""

Alex (played by Shailene Woodley) reminded me a lot of myself at that age. My 'Let's Face It' attitude and 'Believe No Bull' personality got me in a lot of trouble as a teenager. I just wish I had a friend like Sid (Nick Krause) to watch him get punched in the face. That part was funny. =)

This was definitely Clooney's best performance.

Two other performances I enjoyed in this movie were the skilled portrayal of the elder daughter by Shailene Woodley (who has really grown into acting since her days as a hot teenager on The O.C.) and Judy Greer (Fatty Magoo on It's Always Sunny) in a rare dramatic role as the wife of the other man.

that live throughout the Islands.  I also thought the interiors of the homes that were photographed were a little off--especially with their very commercial artwork.  I found it particularly disturbing that the younger people portrayed (some of which were attending Punahou)  a very elite private school on Oahu, were depicted as being foul-mouthed and dim-witted.  I read some of the other reviews and was surprised that no one commented on this issue.

Not really sure how local people in the islands would respond to this movie.  I found it interesting that none of the other actors were particularly attractive people which I thought was a little odd as there are many very good looking people of all nationalities living in the Islands.  The love interest of Elizabeth hardly looked the part...and it seemed to me that having very ordinary looking people in the movie was quite intentional role casting on the director's part.

Nevertheless, after watching it again the following morning I found that I had a much higher opinion of the movie and found it much more enjoyable.  George Clooney did a stupendous job portraying the character of Matt which was very believable and at the same time endearing to watch.  You could almost feel his pain and confusion and his determination to make everything better if he could just have a second chance with his hopes for Elizabeth recovering from her serious head injury.

Although George masterfully portrayed ""just an ordinary guy"" his performance was far from ordinary--it was outstanding.  This movie definitely grows on you as it is not a typical ""eternal sunshine"" Hawaiian paradise"" movie production.  Instead much of the movie was filmed during cloudy, overcast days which helped to set the mood for the reality that the sun does not perpetually shine in paradise.

4474456,5,B004UXUX4Q,"I'll be the first to admit that after seeing a few episodes of The Secret Life of the American Teenager I wasn't quite sure about all of the praise Shailene Woodley was getting for The Descendants. Nothing against her, really. I just see the show as incredibly melodramatic (maybe I haven't seen enough) and not of the same caliber as what they were talking about with The Descendants.

After seeing The Descendants, though, I can say that regardless of what I think about Woodley in Secret Life, she's amazing in the film. Pretty much everyone is, actually.

The Descendants, stars George Clooney as Matt King a Hawaiian lawyer - and land owner - who's wife is in a coma and on life support after a boating accident. It takes his teenage daughter, Alexandra (played by Woodley) to bring to his attention that his wife was having an affair.

Alexandra, the troubled older daughter, has been away at boarding school, but King doesn't seem to know much more about his ten-year-old daughter Scottie's life, either. As he attempts to repair his relationship with his daughters, he also has to cope with the possibility that his wife may not wake up from her coma.

All of that sounds dark and hard to deal with, but The Descendants is incredibly funny. And not inappropriately so, either. It's brilliant in dealing with this flawed (almost, at times, non-existent) parental relationship Clooney's character has with his daughters.

What's also fantastic is that George Clooney looks tired and a little worn out. Right? Who would ever think George Clooney looking tired would be a good thing but it is. He doesn't have his classic, handsome, movie star look throughout this movie and it's what's needed for this character. He's a guy trying to deal with his two daughters (that he does not know how to deal with) and figure out what's happening with his dying wife. He does not need to look rested and refreshed.

The Descendants is based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and while I wasn't sure about wanting to read the book before I saw the movie, I very much do now. (Something that very, very rarely happens.)

This is a movie I absolutely recommend.",1332979200,,2169,4.722222222222222
4474457,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The single most accurate film about Hawaii that I've ever seen. Bar none. And I'm still stunned.

Too often the portrayal, without malice, falsely depicts some kind of wondrous, spiritual and exotic locale. It's not. Not really, or at least not entirely. It's a state in the Union Of The United States. No better or worse than any other of the other 49, notable only for the fact that it's a series of islands sitting in the middle of a vast ocean. The film honestly depicts the congestion - of cars, pollution and people - and the shocking amount of concrete that is paving over much of what used to be ""Old Hawaii"". Clooney's character, Matthew King, opens with a prologue that includes, ""Are...our cancers less fatal, our heartache less painful?"". Exactly.

It's a revelatory and moving film that successfully grasps subtle local themes and issues - many of which malahini won't understand. Not that any of that is an impediment to enjoying this amazing movie.

However, here are a couple of examples:

- The amalgamation of several prominent Missionary Families here in the islands represented by the fictional King clan. Some of which, like the film, are divided about their moral and legal obligations. A tarnished heritage that bestows great wealth to a select few, while simultaneously exposing their lost connection to the people and the 'aina. Often, carrying a blood lineage associated to Cooke, Bishop, Castle, etc., tends to foster a conflicted mixture of admiration, envy and anger amongst the people who actually live in Hawaii and call it home.

Interestingly, the Kings, at least from my perspective, are likely a representation of the Sinclair-Robinsons. Their internal family debate in the 1990's, regarding stewardship of an entire island, sparked a statewide discussion about hereditary landholders and their relationship to the greater community.

- Another aspect which I deeply appreciated: When Matt announces to a gathering of friends that he will follow his wife's wishes to be removed from life support - all of them are caucasian. It would've hollowed this film tremendously if Director Payne had attempted to display some shibai it's-a-small-world-after-all cosmopolitan show of skin colors to appease the politically correct. I'm grateful that it was honest.

And honesty is what this film is all about. Whether it's the cultural rift between the haves and have-nots, and the racial divide that often represent the same groups. Or the tangled human relationships we have with one another, often repressing an ugliness we would rather not confront, 'Descendants' truly delves and explores these often sublime and gray issues.

Tremendously deep, with so many layers of dramatic construction, it's almost indescribable without writing a thesis about the islands and our ohana. Every time you think you have it and the characters down, the story unexpectedly wheels and turns, and suddenly you're looking at a completely different film. Really, sincerely, this is a phenomenal movie.

Absolutely five stars.

Personal Notes:

- Regarding Clooney - '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou/dp/B0054PSY2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>' will always be my favorite performance of the man, but this comes so awfully close to topping it. His deilvery as an absentee-dad and distanced husband was about as complete a character as I've seen in a long time. Neither hero nor villain, but like most people, a mix of something in between.

- Was enchanted by Shailene Woodley, who carried the difficult and critical role of daughter Alexandra King. And along with Saorise Ronan, an impressive young actress whom I'll be watching.

- Wasn't sure who Alexander Payne was, so in doing an IMDb reference check, I realized that I had indeed screened an earlier work. As I think back on it, I wasn't particularly impressed with '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sideways/dp/B0007TKOAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sideways</a>', but I wonder now if I misjudged the film. Based on the incredible detail he captured in this film, and given that I'm not familiar with California wine country, I'll have to set time aside to rescreen that earlier production.",1332979200,,4283,5.441930618401207
4474458,4,B004UXUX4Q,"I wanted to see The Descendants from the second I knew it was directed by Alexander Payne. Sideways and Election are two of my favorite comedies. This one was every bit as good, if more drama than comedy. George Clooney's performance is genuine. The cinematography is beautiful. There are several subplots in the beginning, but Payne is competent at tying them together in the end. I really liked this movie.",1332892800,,408,4.8428571428571425
4474459,4,B004UXUX4Q,"This review is of the Standard DVD version of the film.

While this film by Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""About Schmidt"") garnered LOTS of Academy Awards nomination - and some Oscars too - I wouldn't consider it in a class with the other nominees like ""Hugo"" or ""The Artist"". This is a ""family relationship"" drama, pure and simple. And we have the dying, cheating wife to add some emotion to the story. (No, I'm not doing a spoiler alert here. The trailer tells you she was having an affair and she goes into a non-reversible coma in the film's first five minutes.).

The star of the movie is George Clooney, plain and simple. And he gives a great performance - though you'll still see him as ""handsome actor George Clooney playing a role"". Young actress Amara Miller, as the nine-year old Scottie nearly upstages Clooney in some scenes. The film is a great promotional ad for visiting Hawaii (and a geography - and history - lesson) as Clooney and his two daughters hop the islands searching out his wife's lover.

I certainly enjoyed the film - and so will you. Just don't expect to have a life-changing experience. And, oh yes, bring tissues. You'll need them.

There are well over 100 reviews here already - nearly all about the theater version of the film so you can read as many as you want. This review is focusing on the Standard DVD.

There are four bonuses on the Standard DVD: ""Everybody Loves George"" (7 min) where the cast talks about working with Clooney, ""Working with Alexander Payne"" (13 min) where everyone - including Clooney - talks about the director, ""Hawaiian Style"" (16 minutes) which covers modern Hawaiian culture and the films ""theatrical Trailer""

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4474460,5,B004UXUX4Q,"I was pleasantly surprised to find myself absorbed in this fine drama/comedy starring George Clooney in another fine performance with fine direction from Alexander Payne, who waited several years before committing to this film--but the wait was worth it.  Another plus of course is the Hawaiian background since I lived there many moons ago but again the story is the key here plus the acting especially from the Shaleen Woodley who should've copped an Oscar nom for her supporting role as Clooney's wayward daughter.  It's a shame that ""The Artist"" overtook this fine film but I think the Academy was patting itself on the back for giving it to that French film rather than this masterpiece.",1332806400,,692,4.956896551724138

4474462,1,B004UXUX4Q,"I don't understand why this movie got so much hype.  The characters are all despicable people, the wife cheats (not a spoiler), the daughters are brats and the part about the land is irrelevant.  There are no really good shots of how beautiful Hawaii really is and the history they want to preserve is poorly shown.  Everything in this movie is horrible.  It was horribly written and I hope for ""my generation"" of writers that this crap doesn't set a new [low] standard seen as the new high standard.  I went to see this in theaters with my mom and god mother and they sat there at the end and laughed so hard they cried.  Not because it was a good ending.  Not because it was funny.  But because it was so terrible and we spent $30 between the 3 of us to WATCH it and we didn't walk out (although we all admitted thinking about it several times and asking for our money back).  If I met the screen writers I would tell them they need to quit their day jobs.  It isn't that I don't love an amazingly well written bad person or person with a bad character trait or they do something that isn't terribly nice, but these characters weren't well written.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Horrible.  And proof that people pay off reviewers (of newspapers and magazines; not Amazon) or people pay for the brand.  Sorry Clooney, you sucked.

4474475,2,B004UXUX4Q,"I loved Sideways, thought it was one of the best movies in recent years, was even more amazed when I read the novel and found it was crude and dumb, and had been transmuted into something deep and true by Alexander Payne. So I was hopeful when I streamed this. But it ain't the same. A promising story is somehow manacled rather than liberated. There are several problems. First, Payne labors mightily to try to make the story be about Hawaii. But it isn't. Sideways was about wine and the wine country, because the two most important characters (played by Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen) had the love and lore of wine in their DNA, found each other through wine -- the Giamatti character was even symbolized by Pinot Noir. Wine is more than a character in the movie: it's the very language of the movie. It's also a litmus test of every character, and the wine country as mission (for Giamatti) and escape (for Haden Church) exposes their souls. But this time you could pull the main story out of Hawaii and it would be the same. It's about how a physical accident can expose the fault lines in a family - anywhere. The endless travelogue scenery is poured over the story like a bad Hollandaise over an underdone egg. Then there's Clooney. For my money this guy has elevated ""bad casting"" to a career path. What I mean is, even when he gives a fairly good performance he is always miscast, because there's something about him that defies our ""willing suspension of disbelief"". I mean, you can just never really think he's going through the events depicted. In Sideways I never thought for a moment I was seeing any acting. With Clooney you always think, ""Oh, George is pretending to be _____."" In most of his roles he has consistently looked like a man who knows he's on camera and feels smug about it. In this film he almost slips out of both those nooses, but there's just something about that face - especially the mouth - that makes us unable to take him seriously. Maybe it's vulnerability that doesn't work... think of Cary Grant at his most suave, and there's still this quality of the vulnerable - this uncertainty about the outcome, will he be okay or not? Anyway it's a fair story, and Clooney does an excellent job, as do many other cast members, but like I said, he is miscast, because once again, he's in a movie.",1332720000,3,2330,4.523696682464455
4474476,5,B004UXUX4Q,"This is a great movie.  If you can get passed the mouthy kids and the ""f"" bombs, it is a wonderful human heartfelt movie. George Clooney is a really good actor anyway.  Everyone in the movie did a great job.  A must see.",1332720000,,220,4.069767441860465

4474478,4,B004UXUX4Q,"I kept hearing how great a masterpiece The Descendants was and wanted to see it for myself. I'm not always a big fan of Oscar winning dramas. Not because I don't think they are well written or well acted movies, but sometimes I find them... well... boring.

What can I say? I tend to watch movies for enjoyment and entertainment value more than for any other reason.

The Descendants was well written and acted by the cast. George Clooney rarely disappoints me as an actor and I believed his character. The crazy gamut of emotions he and his daughters were put through due to his wife's accident were very realistic.  Not everyone grieves in the same way and this was evident in the movie. Kids may act out, family members may point fingers, friends may feel guilty... It tests a person greatly to deal with losing someone.

And not just losing anyone - but coming to terms with the fact that a loved one will never wake up from a coma.

Amidst the grieving process, Clooney is in charge of helping his family deal with their trust estate. The trust owns many acres of virgin Hawaii land. He and his cousins must sell it before the trust dissolves in 7 years. They are going through bids to find a buyer they are comfortable selling their ancestor's land to for development. While they are descendants of Hawaiian people, there are many native residents that do not want the sale to go through.

I thought the entire story was believable and hit close to home - besides the land, the devastation that swept over this family could happen to just about any of us. Any day a loved one could be in an accident that puts them in a vegetative state, leaving the rest to figure out how to live without them. What words were last said... Secrets unveiled... How do you get closure on anger with someone you can never speak with again?

The ending reflected real life too by being sort of ""happy enough for now."" it wasn't a sad ending but it was not a definite happy ending.

Some takeaway messages I found in this movie:

Some things are worth preserving as is even if it means losing out on millions of dollars because doing the right thing is always priceless.
Some things are better left unknown.
Always be honest with those you love.
Verdict: Rent it! While I thought it was a good movie, I did not really enjoy it. It was real and emotion driven, but I don't find much rewatchability in these types of movies. (Save for a few favorites).  I tend to rewatch ones that make me feel good and laugh more often than any other type of movie.

Usually busy with work, after his wife's accident and subsequent coma, he finds himself in the role of primary parent.

Also going on is a piece of inherited family land on Kauai that is about to sold, making multiple cousins very rich (and Clooney controls the trust and the ultimate decision to sell or not).

I loved this film so much as it is a unique perspective of a father and his two daughters, and the father being cheated on, not another movie of a mom and her children struggling after the husband cheated. This is by far Clooney's best film and it is easy to get caught up in his situation. I did not like the daughters the first time I saw this in the theater, it after watching it a second time, I understand. They are troubled and clearly have not had an involved parent in their lives.

George is trying to survive one tribulation after another. He's joined by his 17 & 10 year old daughters. The plot is serious, yet touching. It's comical in spots in a tongue in cheek way.

The movie shows us various parts of the human psyche. The ability to deal with the unexpected surprises life throws our way. It's not your typical tear jerker which has been done forever.

Not only was it an authentic view of what goes on, it was a view into the concerns we have for our sacred land and development that is all about personal greed and money. It was also an authentic look into the plight of our American youth who seem to have little respect for authority as there is often no one in authority for them to respect.

4474516,5,B004UXUX4Q,"Alexander Payne knows how to make a character-driven film. In his previous movies ""Election"" and ""Sideways,"" the good guys are inherently flawed and the villains have many virtues, but people constantly get themselves into trouble by making those little decisions that have major, unforeseen consequences.

""Everything just happens."" The line heard in Payne's latest film, ""The Descendants,"" neatly sums up the writer-director's philosophy. Much happens to Matt King (George Clooney) in this movie, set entirely in Hawaii, where King's life is teetering on the edge of picturesque seaside cliffs. His thrill-seeking wife lies in a coma following a powerboat accident, and her chances of recovery are slim. The couple's 10-year-old daughter, Scottie (Amara Miller), rages against the world, and King is so feckless a dad that he turns to his 17-year-old, Alex (Shailene Woodley), for help, even though he has already sent her to boarding school to wean her off alcohol, drugs and men.  The other potential source of help, King's father-in-law (Robert Forster), blames him for the accident.

King's family brings another huge piece of baggage: a piece of Hawaii's soul. The King family are Haole descendants of King Kamehameha's family (Haole is Hawaiian for honkey) and King's cousins have each squandered their vast inheritances. King has preserved his share by living a comparably frugal life and, understandably, he is the sole trustee of the family's once-vast trust. The trust owns one major asset, an unspoiled 25,000-acre plot of paradise on Kauai that most of King's cousins want to sell to a developer. Such a sale would infuriate most of the state, but Cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges) makes it clear that a few hundred million soothes a wounded conscience quite nicely.

To top it off (as we saw in the movie's trailer), King learns that his wife has been cheating on him. And so it is we see King's point when he observes, ""Paradise? Paradise can go . . ."" (Well, you know.)

Ultimately, ""The Descendants"" is about King's quest for redemption: as a father, a husband, and a Hawaiian. In a lesser movie, he would move smoothly through the steps of healing and emerge triumphant with a big speech announcing his hard-won wisdom. ""The Descendants"" does not take any easy shortcuts. While King wants to connect with his daughters, he doesn't have a clue how to do it. He, naturally, is also consumed with tracking down his wife's lover (Matthew Lillard) and finds an unlikely ally in Alex; this is hardly the traditional bonding experience for a father and daughter. Clooney, a nominee for a best actor Oscar, is a perfect choice to play King. Looking a bit more haggard than his normal Danny Ocean self, Clooney is as vulnerable as we've ever seen him. We believe it when he turns to his daughter's stoner boyfriend (Nick Krause) for advice.

As usual in a Payne movie, all the performances are first-rate, and Shailene Woodley is particularly strong as the frustrated older daughter. Ultimately a comedy, ""The Descendants"" is a rich character study steeped in the romance of Hawaii. Gorgeously shot (I watched the high-definition Blu-ray) and scored with a charming Hawaiian guitar soundtrack, the movie stands proudly next to Payne's best work, and that's high praise.

A healthy dose of extras include deleted scenes and several small documentaries, including an exploration of the real-life ""Descendants,"" an examination of the Hawaiian mystique, and a discussion with Clooney and Payne.

4474519,5,B004UXUX4Q,"There are movies that are released and then discussed later when Oscar time rolls around as being the next best thing since sliced bread. The actors and directors are talked about and make the talk show route. Almost always these incidents are nothing more than hype, trying to drum up interest in a film that is nominated but nowhere near as good as they claim. Then there are the rare times when it all clicks and turns out to be true as with THE DESCENDANTS.

George Clooney stars as Matt King, a hard working property lawyer whose made his mark while living in Hawaii. As the film opens Matt has had a major setback arrive in a speed boating accident involving his wife Elizabeth. As she lays in a coma while the doctors wait to see how she responds to treatment, Matt is faced with day to day life at home involving his youngest daughter Scottie (Amara Miller).

This is not Matt's area of expertise. It soon becomes apparent that home life has little to do with Matt of late and that he has no idea how to be involved in his child's life. Scottie has been acting up at school, presumably dealing with the life threatening situation her mother is in. With no idea how to cope with Scottie, Matt flies the two of them to another island where his older daughter Alexandra (Shallene Woodley) is enrolled in boarding school with the hopes she will help him.

But Alexandra doesn't offer all the help Matt needs. Following in her rambunctious mother's footsteps, Alexandra has shown a drug problem in the past and when Matt arrives he finds her drunk. Flying home the next day they talk about what is going on and why she fought with her mother the last time the two spoke. It is then that Alexandra drops the bomb in Matt's lap that spurs on the rest of the film. She lets him know that her mother was having an affair and that she had planned to divorce Matt. This scene displays the acting ability of Clooney perhaps more than any other in his career as he displays shock, outrage, pain and disbelief within a matter of seconds. In addition Matt is told there is nothing more to be done and that due to her living will his wife is soon to be taken off life support.

So begins Matt's quest, aided by his daughters and Alexandra's friend Sid (Nick Krause) to find the man his wife was involved with. It turns out the man is a realtor and in witnessing one of his signs in a yard, Matt and Alexandra are able to find him on another island. Soon the four are flying once more to find this man.

With little solid clues they trace him to a hotel only to find he's not there. It is by chance that Matt passes him on the beach one morning while jogging and follows him home to a cottage where he sees him with a wife and two children. Having told himself over and over again that he wants to offer this man the chance to say goodbye to Elizabeth, reality isn't quite what he expected. What does he do now?

While all of this is going on a side story has Matt trying to decide what to do with a huge acreage of land that his family owns. As trustee for the land, it is up to Matt what they finally do. One group of cousins wants to sell to a high finance man from Chicago who intends to develop the land with hotels and golf courses. The other is a local man who wants to do the same but continue to involve local people. And then there is the minority who feel that the land should remain as it is in pristine condition. In seven years the trust falls apart. If they sell now each cousin and Matt have the chance at making millions.

At the heart of the film are two quests involving Matt. One involves his discovering the family that he left behind for the office, getting back in touch with his children and rediscovering who they really are as well as who he is. The second is relating to the land he was put in care of, a land and history that goes well beyond years and property rights and involved a tradition and sense of community. Where Matt will go with either quest isn't seen until the final reel.

Clooney is amazing here. Rather than go for an over the top performance he displays so many subtle signs of emotion that you can feel each and every thing that goes through the character's mind as the story unfolds. His frustration, his rage, his sadness are all on display through the performance Clooney offers and it stands out as one of his best. Equally amazing is his supporting cast, most notably Woodley and Miller who show a large emotional depth for their young years.

This film isn't a feel good movie but at the same time it isn't a downer either. It offers true moment of humor as well as drama and tells a story that involves you from beginning to end. As I watched I wondered if this was a movie I would watch again or just place on the shelf. In the end I decided it has to be seen more than once with time spent between viewings the better to appreciate what is seen on screen. This is one movie you don't want to miss.",1332201600,4,4945,4.27457264957265
4474520,4,B004UXUX4Q,"By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Matt King (George Clooney) is a Honolulu lawyer, and the sole trustee of a family trust. He is about to sell off 25,000 pristine acres on the Island of Kauai.
He does have to get the approval of his numerous cousins who, for the most part, have already spent their share of the profits in their minds.
His wife, Elizabeth is a bit of a daredevil and given to drink, takes to waterskiing behind a fast boat on choppy seas. There is an accident which leaves Elizabeth comatose.
Matt meets with the doctor only to find that she is not going to recover and that her wishes are to pull the plug.
Matt, who has always put business first, is forced to become a full-time father to the couple's two daughters, Scottie (10) and Alex (17). The kids have little respect for him, and yet he knows he must tell them ""Mommy is not coming back."" The kids have been under the impression that their mother would recover.
He tells the oldest, Alex first. Alex has convinced herself that she hates Elizabeth and doesn't care. When pushed for her reasoning -- she tells Matt that Elizabeth was having an affair at the time of the accident.
Clueless, Matt must decide whether to find out with who and if he should confront or not. He also must go and tell his wife's parents that Elizabeth is not going to recover. Her mother has Alzheimers and her dad (Fred Ward) never thought Matt was good enough for his daughter.
The Descendants is a great film, filled with drama, humor and teaches family comes first in the long run.",1332201600,,1558,4.466666666666667
4474521,3,B004UXUX4Q,"Maybe it's my fault.  I was expecting a lot more.  From the Oscar nods to the well-woven movie trailer, The Descendants seemed like it would be a story that took you on a great journey of an estranged father reconnecting with his family after a tragic accident.  That seemed to happen in the first 30 minutes and then the film held one note for the next hour.  There were no real great personal discoveries, no real moments that tugged at the heart and connected you with these characters and the overarching backdrop of a family who were the Descendants of the first settlers in Hawaii and who owned all of this virgin Hawaiian land was just too predictable for me to be surprised at the end.

It's not a bad movie, but it certainly doesn't deserve the crazy hype that it got either.  There are one or two really great lines in the film and then the rest of it is just vanilla.  It's a film about dealing with the loss of a family member taken too soon, but it's also a film about betrayal and anger...at least, it should have been.  Clooney, again, plays one note through the whole thing except for one tender moment near the end of the film.  His anger and frustration isn't consistent, his mellow temper towards his daughter's outbursts just makes his character as plain as a a white t-shirt.  Maybe that was the intent.  At the end of the film, I felt the same way about the guy and about the family as I did at the beginning of the film.  The only character development I really saw was the older daughter's surfer-dude friend.  He has some great scenes and some great moments in that film, but he is a bit character and not who the focus of the film was supposed to be about.

Again, nothing against the film.  The acting was fine.  The script was okay.  The backdrop of Hawaii was nice...but I wanted something more.  I wanted more out of the character development and the overall story.  I wanted some real reactions and some real emotions that lasted longer than just one scene.  There is a great scene at the pool where the oldest daughter is told about her mother's condition and she submerges herself and cries underwater...but then, it doesn't phase her after that.

Many of us have experienced the loss of people that we love and it IS a roller coaster of emotions and feelings, pain and joy, sorrow and madness...this film didn't go there and I wish it would have.  It would have been and could have been one of those films like Ordinary People or Forrest Gump.  Films that will endure because of how incredibly human they are.  I don't think The Descendants is in the same league.",1332115200,2,2597,4.453389830508475

This is a  character struggling though real difficulties. But from Clooney's performance, you would never know it.

The story was sappy and contrived.

The husband (George Clooney) after living for years in a bad marriage finds out his wife has been cheating on him ~ after she's injured and put in a coma. He then invites his teen daughter along to set out to find the guy (great guidance dad ~ it's your wife you needed long ago to deal with before your daughter's got screwed up.) Anyway, they find him and via that the `other man's' wife learns about the affair.

So she comes to the hospital with flowers to meet the `other woman.' A friendly looking gesture, that turns into a one-sided hospital bed confrontation. What? It would be hysterical, except that this was supposed to be a serious scene. The woman then goes into this incredibly nauseating speech about forgiveness, because she has to. As I'm watching, I'm wondering why go after the `other person?' Isn't it your husband (or wife as the case may be) that you should be screaming bloody murder and throwing out on their a__? And for Clooney's character, according to him it was a very bad marriage so what's with the incredibly sappy `I love you' speech to his dying wife? Yes, she's dying, you might want to send her off well, but he didn't need to pretend the marriage was something other than what he had been saying all the way through the movie ~ or was it guilt because he didn't let her buy her own boat ~ as his father-in-law repeatedly stated?

4474566,4,B004UXUX4Q,"Yes, the story is worth telling (from a book by Kaui Hart Hemmings) and the study of contemporary family life with all its flaws is commendable, and yes, George Clooney submerges himself in a role that is anything but his usual romance hero roles, but it seems that the ideas presented could have been condensed into an hour long movie for television instead of spread over 2 hours of interminable Hawaiian music backed vistas of the islands. The film appeals to a lot of people and that is satisfying to note that movie goers care enough about end of life issues and flawed parenting skills to support the ideas buried in this extravaganza.

Matt King (George Clooney though looking unkempt and sloppy is solid in a an introspective and subdued performance) is a real estate attorney who happens to be the controlling descendant in a family whose ancestors date back to the days of Hawaiian kings: the family owns a large parcel of land they plan to sell to become instantly wealthy, a move the Hawaiians find disturbing as the influx of commercialism would destroy the native beauty of their island. Matt's wife Elizabeth is critically injured in a boating accident and is in a coma, not only affecting Matt emotionally but also pointing up the fact that he must assume full parental duties in coping with his two rather outrageous daughters - Alexandra (Shailene Woodley in a career making brilliant role) and chubby troublesome Scottie (Amara Miller). He brings Alex home from the boarding school she has been attending in an attempt to make her less sociopathic (she has fought seriously with her mother, drinks to excess and behaves badly) but she come with her loopy friend Sid (Nick Krause, another fine performance) who ends up being not unlike Matt.  Alex tells Matt the Elizabeth was having an affair, a note that shocks Matt and sets him on a quest to discover who gained his wife's attention. When he discovers the boyfriend was a married real estate broker Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) whose wife Julie (Judy Greer) Matt meets on the beach the attempt to bring closure to this portion of Matt's life, as Elizabeth is taken off life support machines, opens windows of communication between Matt and his daughters, with Sid who isn't as loopy as Matt perceived, with Elizabeth's parents (Robert Forster and Barbara L. Southern who embodies Alzheimer's Disease well), and most of all with himself. He gains courage to respect his heritage of Hawaiian land, dismisses his family's greed (from which Brian Speer would have benefited), and becomes an enlightened and emotionally more mature man.

THE DESCENDANTS is a worthy film with a few good performances and a star turn for Clooney and Woodley, but oh, turn off that interminable Hawaiian music that drowns the story like a tsunami! Grady Harp, March 12",1331942400,,2817,4.889121338912134

4474568,2,B004UXUX4Q,"The basic premise to this movie is a married father of two girls wife gets seriously injured in a boating accident. As she lays in a coma he finds out she had an affair.

The problem is the father is a weak man. He is a horrible father. His two daughters are wild, out of control, foul, filthy mouthed brats that he blames on his wife's medical condition. He isn't a good husband from what we are told. Yes he provides the house and material things but we learn his wife fell in love with another man. Is that his fault? Well we are led to believe that. He doesn't get along with his relatives. There is in-fighting on what to do with inherited land.  This same situation puts a rift between him and his neighbors too. He doesn't really have any friends. We see his wife's friends but not his. He even has to go pry out of a couple of them that his wife is indeed been having an affair and that she was going to divorce him. And in the end he has to murder his wife by ""pulling the plug"" as they say. So who wants to watch a movie about such a person? I don't. I saw a review that said that this movie was depressing. It isn't so much as depressing as it is icky. It is uncomfortable watching the, now, proverbial train wreck in front of you.

It isn't even sad. I mean it is sad in watching what appears to be common in America--immature parents raising out of control kids that mess up society forcing their dysfunctionalism on the rest of us. That is sad. But it is not sad in a tear jerker way. I suspect, for me, that the entire reason is not the weak characters we are watching but that George Looney is simply not a good actor in  my eyes> I think he is another born into stardom actor who can do a better job than say Madonna  or Princess Stephanie so he stays around. But in every movie I saw that he happened to be in he just stands around reading lines out loud half heartedly with the same mannerisms. In the movie he can't even pull off the ""I'm so cool and goodlooking"" mannerisms as he looks old (his age) and almost like a puffy faced drunk.

If all of this is not reason enough to pass on paying 3.99 for a VOD rental then if you are like me you would want to know the liberal propaganda the movie spews. There is the native Hawaiian subtexts. Research that and find out what radicals float in those circles. I mean why not just have a movie set in Hawaii? It is everywhere in this movie down to the cheesy Don Ho (spelling?) songs . . . scratch ""cheesy"" . . . read annoying. There is the capitalism vs environmentalists issue that we hear daily on a national political level starting in 2009 to 2012. There is the anti-bullying stuff we hear in the news where kids are set up to be perpetual victims. Etc etc etc. The profanity is not just your typical curse word here and there. This is some vile language and what is disturbing is it was almost always the kid characters saying this stuff. The male teenage kid who acts, looks, and talks like a pot head and just as matter of factly comments on it.

Weak characters. Weak political arguments/minds at play behind this movie. Weak movie.  Glad I only spent $4 and not $12 at the theatre.",1331942400,3,3156,4.187808896210873

I didn't enjoy this film for a number of reasons. First, is Hollywood's insistence on portraying teenagers as thoroughly unlikable and disrespectful. I found it irritating that George Clooney's character allowed his daughters to use the f-word, refer to eachother as ""motherless whores"", ""twats"", etc. and basically carry on like deliquents.
This is typical Hollywood: all teenagers are mouthy little twerps and the parents sigh, and seem incapable of behaving like actual adults. Instead, they are portrayed as harrassed, weary, and impotent.
The viewer is led to assume that the father has been absent for much of his childrens' lives. Oddly, though, he never seems to work once his wife becomes comatose. Where did his work load go? What happened to his legal cases? No matter, we're not supposed to wonder about that. We're also not supposed to feel incredulous when George Clooney's character allows his daughter's moronic and rude boy friend to tag along on the family's journeys. We're also not to question why a husband, who is about to lose his wife and mother to his children, would spend so much time tracking down her former lover. To what end? For what purpose? I like George Clooney, but his character in this film is flat and one-dimensional.

Actually, I'm not sure if ""lots"" is the right word either. This is one maddening film.

First off, I am more then familiar than Alex Payne. After all he did do my favourite movie of 2005, Sideways. However I absolutely hated About Schmidt. I thought it was boring tripe, but I decided to put that aside and watch it on the strength of Sideways alone. And boy, was I dead wrong.

The film follows a real estate agent in Hawaii, Matt King, whose wife has ended up in a bad accident that has thrust her into a near death state. With the tragedy affecting his already broken family, he reunites with his bitchy teenage daughter, who spends the movie with some douchebag I couldn't for the life of me care about. She reveals that his wife had an affair with a rival agent of his, which leads him to seek him out to confront him face to face, and seal the deal on a piece of land he owns.

First off, I liked Clooney. He was the film, and without him I would have been bored outright. He's the one thing keeping it watchable. Oh, and it was shot beautifully too.

But... The film just bored me.

First off, it's SO PREDICTABLE. I predicted the whole thing with the land and how Matt would decide he wanted to keep the land instead of selling it. I predicted how he'd fall for Speer's wife. I predicted that Speer had a wife and kids too. Seriously, how did you not see it coming?

The characters were boring as hell. The only memorable one was Beau Bridges and he was only in the film for 6 minutes. Speer was so clichd in terms of development.

Oh, and worst of all- it was so full of clichs. You can tell how it's going to end from the opening scene, and you can essentially think to yourself ""I think this is going to happen"" and -gasp- it does!

But, it is prettily shot. I guess that's all that's needed to constitute Oscar bait nowadays. This isn't a bad film but it has every right to be, and the fact that it is up against The Artist for best picture is just laughable, because The Artist really does deserve the award.

The latter informs Matt that his wife was cheating on him, and while on a journey to inform her family of what is happening, Matt decides to seek out this other man.

It's a rather complex plot, actually, layered with deep character development and details.  Director/screenwriter Alexander Payne holds everything together marvelously; this is a beautifully crafted, beautifully shot film.  What truly breathes life into THE DESCENDANTS, however, is Payne's way with his actors.  The film rests squarely on the shoulders of George Clooney; while at times ripping off his mannerisms from UP IN THE AIR (the narration doesn't help), Clooney ultimately delivers a very nuanced, very natural performance that probably deserved the 2012 Best Acting Oscar (but we all knew Jean Dujardin would win, didn't we?  Yes, we did.)  Woodley matches Clooney step-for-step, in what will be regarded as her breakthrough performance.  Miller also gives a solid performance (I've ranted about child actors before; there's no need to rant about Miller).  Robert Forster gives a memorable performance at Matt's father-in-law, while Matthew Lillard takes a nice dramatic turn as ""the other man"" (with Judy Greer as his wife).  Nick Krause provides some fantastic comedic moments as Sid, a teenage suitor.

And that's the great thing about THE DESCENDANTS: even at its darkest, saddest moments, it doesn't forget to be funny.  Because humor can be found anywhere, and Payne and company aren't afraid to show you.  Some viewers may be put off by the fact that a movie about a family coping with death can be so funny in spots; but such is life.

4474584,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants (2011)
Comedy, Drama, 115 minutes
Directed by Alexander Payne
Starring George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Nick Krause and Amara Miller

***Spoilers within***

It took me about two minutes to decide that The Descendants was going to be my kind of film. It happened during Clooney's opening voice-over in which he observed that, just because they live in paradise, Hawaiians aren't exempt from the usual problems people face. That statement caught my attention because it's true, but it also alerted me to the possibility that the script would be both truthful and more intelligent than most.

Matt King (Clooney) is the kind of character that I can identify with. He's a lawyer and his job is more important to him than his family. He regularly travels to neighboring islands on business and hasn't had a proper relationship with his wife and two daughters for several years. When his wife has an accident which places her in a coma, Matt's life changes instantly. He has to be a father to his daughters and he's completely unprepared.

His younger daughter, Scottie (Miller), is 10 years old. Matt last took care of her when she was three. His other daughter, Alex (Woodley), is 17 and is in a boarding school to help her overcome alcohol and drug problems. When Matt learns that his wife will never wake up, he takes Scottie to collect Alex from the school. Alex is drunk when he turns up and openly defies him early in the film.

Place yourself in Matt's situation for a moment. How would you attempt to console your daughters? What would help you establish some kind of connection with them? If you're all they have left, how will you make them feel as if everything is going to be all right?

Matt isn't happy with Alex because she argued with her mother the last time they spoke, but her reasoning is sound; she found out that her mother was cheating on Matt. Alex insists that her boyfriend, Sid (Krause), stays with her while she is home. Sid appears to be fairly dumb and occasionally stoned. Matt is not happy.

The story really takes off when Matt takes Sid and his daughters to a neighboring island in search of his wife's lover. Another story thread explains that Matt and his many cousins are descended from Hawaiian royalty and own a piece of land worth around $500 million. Matt is the sole trustee and must organize the group of cousins and decide who to sell the land to. A complication emerges later in the story which could have a major impact on his decision, but I won't reveal any more of the film's secrets.

I've watched Clooney develop as an actor over the past few years. He used to be criticized for ""always being Clooney"", but I think he's proved that there's a lot more to him. His timing is excellent and he always delivers his comedic lines well, but he has to show considerable range as Matt. Many of the scenes require him to show his feelings without the use of words. He goes through a lot of emotions during the film and pulls it off perfectly whether the situations are positive or negative. His performance is human, real, touching, emotional and understandable. I thought he should have won the Oscar for his performance in Up in the Air, but this latest oversight is a glaring error.

What I really liked about the film was the character development. We see Matt grow as expected, but I was stunned by the development shown in Alex and Sid. They both have more to them than meets the eye and I ended up liking both characters tremendously.

The conclusions that Matt reaches by the end of the story seem plausible and fit well with his development as a father and as a responsible adult. I might have reached the same conclusions if I were placed in his shoes.

You'll definitely laugh during The Descendants and you may even be moved to tears.

Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash won the Oscar for their adaptation of Kaui Hart Hemmings' book and it was thoroughly deserved. It's rare to witness a film with such intelligent writing. The characters and situations are always believable. If you were in their position, you might find yourself behaving in the same way.

The Descendants is my favorite film of 2011 and, in a few years, I suspect many will wonder why it didn't win for Best Picture when we find out whether The Artist has lasting appeal.",1331424000,3,4312,4.628272251308901

The scenery was beautiful and the concept of ""finding the important things in life"" through a family tragedy is commendable, but to us, the film just didn't rise to the level of enjoyable entertainment.  We found it to be a chore to make it to the end of the movie.  I have to agree with one of the other reviewers who commented about all the high reviews, ""what ARE people thinking?""  Must be easy to please or George Clooney devotees?!",1331337600,10,552,4.49

It is somewhat of a family picture as well with no crazy car chases, gun fights or stuff like that.  My only complaint was at the end we were not exactly sure what he did with the land.  Appeared he kept it but then again I left the theatre with that question which I did not like since it really did not bring closure to the film.  Maybe I missed something but I never got bored during the movie so would be hard for me to think I did miss something.  Nonetheless, a very fine picture.

4474587,4,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants marks Alexander Payne's return to directing after a seven year absence and before The Artist stole its thunder it was considered the Oscar front-runner in the Best Picture and Best Actor categories. In the end, it won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Critically speaking, it's quite the comeback. In almost 20 years Payne has directed only five films, all from screenplays co-written with his writing partner Jim Taylor. This is the first film the two have not collaborated on the script for, although Taylor remains a producer and Payne's consistency remains as well. As a director, Payne has displayed a unique style that functions through the acting, editing, music, camera work, and writing. That style that was so prevalent in Election, About Schmidt, and Sideways is not as prominent here. It has that quirky Payne-humor coupled with heartwrenching drama, but I wonder if Payne chose to play it safe for his comeback. It obviously worked for him in most circles, but this being his most commercial, straight-forward, and safe effort left me underwhelmed. Payne still deftly blends poignant drama with just the right dose of comedy, once again giving us one of the best films of last year. I just say this with less enthusiasm than I have had for his previous films.

The Descendants is based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings and was shot on location in Hawaii. George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer and the sole trustee of untouched Hawaiian land. With the trust set to expire in seven years, Matt is in the middle of a big deal to sell the land when his wife Elizabeth is involved in a boating accident that puts her in a coma. A dire prognosis forces Matt, who has always been the ""back-up parent,"" to take charge in caring for his two daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley). His relationship with Alex is already strained when she reveals a secret about her comatose mother that unravels Matt's entire life.

The beautiful Hawaiian setting adds an ironic contrast to the heavy material. Like any film shot in Hawaii this is beautiful to look at, but the scenery takes a backseat to the involving and touching story. There's a good reason Payne is on the short list of filmmakers retaining final cut privileges to their films. He's a master at handling heavy dramatic subjects with subtlety and humor, while demonstrating a firm grasp on characters and their development. This is a very consistent film with several wonderful scenes. Look at the beautifully acted confrontation between Clooney and Matthew Lillard. It's a bittersweet, tense scene, heartfelt and funny that reveals Lillard as an effective, underutilized talent. He plays this scene to perfection, never over-playing it and finding the perfect balance of guilt, fear, and regret.

There's a character named Sid (played by Nick Krause), who shows up doing his best Keanu Reeves impression and seemingly has no role in the story except to accompany Alex and frustrate Matt. Never one to stick to conventions, Payne builds this character to a surprisingly poignant moment with Matt that feels remarkably sincere when it would've seemed contrived in the hands of a lesser writer/director. Finally, Matt's goodbye to his wife is one of the most quietly moving scenes of any film last year. It's a brief, beautiful moment; understated, despite being the film's emotional climax.

Robert Forster and Beau Bridges do memorable turns with very few scenes, while Lillard emerges from his permanent spot as Shaggy in anything Scooby-Doo related to show off unexpected range. Miller and Woodley are terrific as the daughters, particularly the 20-year-old Woodley who gives a performance that blows many of her contemporaries out of the water. It announces the emergence of a bright young actress, who is wasting her talent on that unfortunate television show.

Clooney, meanwhile, gives his most mature performance to date and certainly one of his best. It's a far cry from the suave, deliriously handsome characters he usually plays. His performance as Matt King is quiet, heartbreaking, and without an ounce of bravado. It shows him in a completely different light. That scene between Matt and his comatose wife is real, powerful acting. Out of the five Best Actor nominees, Clooney was no doubt the runner-up.

The Descendants is professionally-made, high-quality melodrama that never diverges into new territory and only separates itself from the pack with Payne's offbeat blend of the comic and tragic. It doesn't rank too highly on the list, but it is one of 2011's best films despite the faint scent of Oscar-bait that surrounds the entire movie and its failure to make the same impact of Payne's previous work. It may not be profound, but it's hard to dislike or not be affected by. It's a melancholy, pleasing effort that I just don't foresee being discussed years from now. Even with these shortcomings, it has heart and is a welcome return from Alexander Payne and a nice change of pace for George Clooney.",1330732800,2,5060,5.017857142857143

Gregory Peck once said it's hard to make a good man look interesting.

You can probably imagine in a cinematic world peopled with antiheroes, flawed heroes, or unrealistic superheroes, how refreshing it might be, to encounter a good guy we can relate to, in situations that parallel those we might actually experience.

George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer, businessman, and hardworking mostly absent father of two girls. He happens to be wealthy because of his descent from the original landowners of Hawaii, the real Hawaiians, who own most of Hawaii. Sole trustee of the family's interests, and now because of succession rules faced with the situation of having to sell off thousands of acres of pristine land to resort developers. Despite his family wealth Doug leads a very modest life. He drives a metallic silver Honda Civic, a sensible car.

When his thrillseeking wife ends up in a coma following a powerboating accident, he is thrust into the unfamiliar role of looking after his two daughters each bringing their own challenges. The younger one has difficulties in school, the older one, well, she's a teenager.

We learn early in the movie that the wife had an affair, making a difficult situation even worse. George Clooney Alex Payne manage to create apposite emotions for the movie goer. While distressed he pads out the front door, dons flipflops and runs to his wife's best friend house. He runs funny. A comic relief followed by a dramatic confrontation. Tension, and shock artfully modified by humor make this movie an emotional wonder.

When he breaks the news of his wife's condition to his older daughter she ducks underwater and we see an invisible breakdown. Some of these scenes are tender. In the hospital there are various monologues to the comatose mother, from a cheated husband, an unforgiving daughter, and a wounded wife.

The presence of Clooney vastly elevates the movie, as does the acting performance of Shailene Woodley, giving a tremendous breakthrough performance as the teenage daughter you worry might go off the rails. Judy Greer, who you probably know from Two and a Half Men appears later in the movie.

The Descendants is among the leading Oscar nominated movies. Although nine movies are nominated for Best Picture, only three I believe are genuine contenders, The Artist, and Hugo being the other two. Nominations for The Descendants include Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay.

Previously, Alex Payne won the Academy Award for the Sideways screenplay.

4474593,4,B004UXUX4Q,"Alexander Payne has written and directed films (Sideways, About Schmidt) about men at unique crossroads in life and coming to grim, sobering realizations that cause a reevaluation of the past and an uncertain future.  In The Descendents, he focuses on a man's family dealing with grief and the hidden truths that threaten to tear it apart.  George Clooney is outstanding as a nave husband and father who must confront life after a terrible series of events.

A water skiing accident in Hawaii has left a woman in a coma and her husband/lawyer, Matt (George Clooney), grief stricken and stunned by the news that she was having an affair with another man.  It seems that everyone knew about the affair but Matt who was too busy with his work to even notice, and he must come to terms with it and rebuild his family.  Matt's daughters are a troubled ten year old Scottie (Amara Miller) and his older teen, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) who has a spacy boyfriend, Sid.  As the family realizes that their mom may never recover, they must make some major decisions, and Matt must find the truth even if it means confronting the man who stole her heart.  Meanwhile, Matt, as the primary trustee for the extended family, has an impending major land sale he must decide upon that could be a financial windfall for his relatives.  Determined to meet his wife's lover, Matt does some detective work and, with some help from his daughters, finally arranges to meet the object of his obsession which causes him to reassess his own life and his relationship with his daughters.

This is Clooney's film all the way, and he gives a thoroughly convincing portrait of a man betrayed and oblivious to his wife and his family. He is not the handsome, dashing Clooney of Oceans 11 or Ides of March but rather an unglamorous fellow who is vulnerable. The pain and realization he emotes is heartfelt. Woodley lends excellent support as the knowing daughter who helps her father's quest.

Through much of the story you wonder if Matt will exact some kind of revenge on the creep or do something impulsive.  That bit of tension only adds to an engaging plot.  In the end, Matt does the right things and brings closure for his family.  The final shot is great as Matt tries to become a dad again to his girls.  A major subplot involving the land deal gets even more complicated as surprising information is revealed when Matt investigates his wife's lover.  There are occasional moments of hilarity as when Matt is at the end of his rope and resorts to asking Sid for advice. It is a riot of a moment.

There are good details which add to our understanding of Matt's family including his cranky father-in-law (Robert Forster) and a mother-in-law who has Alzheimer's disease.  What is special about a film like this is that each major character evolves through events and changed to a degree by the end (including spacy Sid).  That marks good character development.  These are not cardboard caricature but fully etched individuals with weaknesses like anyone, and our initial impressions about each are dispelled by film's end.

The Hawaiian scenery is gorgeous but never used as a travelogue.  It merely sets the scene as did the wineries in Sideways and in some ways, the tropical paradise serves as counterpoint to the despair and angst that Matt must endure.

You could imagine a Broadway version of this story since it relies more on characters and situation.  The film makes you care for and sustain interest in the main characters (brought to life by a strong cast) and what happens to them.  In the end, there is sadness and regret but also hope, the kind of hope that strengthens and bonds a family.",1330041600,,3680,4.731974921630094

Not a single friend of mine agreed to go for this film with me. The ones who'd already seen the film seemed to have forewarned others about the film's lack of entertainment. It seems people don't go to the films anymore in search for what I would term as the truest form of a drama. Anyway, so I had to see this film at home and I really loved it. I knew I wanted to watch this film when I heard the reviews (same exact words from all my friends)

My favourite scene involves the protagonist running senselessly as if it his sense of dignity he is running after. The Descendants with it's uniquely executed well studied storyline seemed to be an imperative formula I thought despite it's DARK sense of humor that may stump most viewers.

The film is a wonderful study of superficiality and on a side note it was also interesting to watch how well the director Alexander Payne managed to catch the sheer ungratefulness of rich kids who've inherited a large wealth. The emotion or lack of is captured masterfully in a scene or two.

This was a pointless piece of film-making centered around George Clooney's character who I neither cared for nor believe exits in the real world. And that includes Hawaii. C'mon, the comic relief character for this maudlin exercise in tropical bleakness practically steals every scene he's in!

The only really interesting character the film possesses is the dead wife and she had the good sense to exit stage-left (figuratively speaking) before the opening credits were over. Maybe the film-makers realized that and that's why they kept her around in a coma until the end.

As the film proceeds, we find that the impetuous wife has done all sorts of things, some which will remain secret so as not to ruin the plot. We also find that his two daughters, age 10 and 17, are behaving in many self-destructive, neurotic ways, which the father must contend with even as his wife lies on the edge between life and death.

The overriding theme of this gem directed by Alexander Payne is how we endure suffering. You can see the weight of the world on George Clooney's shoulders as he descends deeper and deeper into misery and while tempted into bitterness and spite,  we see a man stake claim to his humanity for the sake of himself and his children.

As the father decides to be spiteful or accepting for the many betrayals he encounters, I was reminded of a Louis C.K. show where he tries to dissuade a depressed friend from committing suicide. He says, ""Your life is not your own. It belongs to your family, friends, and society at large.""

I felt the Clooney character came to this realization.  All of this is done without being bombastic and preachy. Rather, the film is mostly funny and sad, a typical duality from Payne who did the same in Election and Sideways. This is the best Clooney performance I've seen.

4474620,5,B004UXUX4Q,"MOVIE REVIEW #20: The Descendants

Alexander Payne, director of a couple of my favorite independent films ""Sideways"" and ""Election"" -  has done it again. The ""Descendants"" was a surprisingly warm, entertaining and thoughtful film. It deals specifically with a family going through a specific tragedy and dealing with that tragedy and all the secrets they never knew existed.

George Clooney pulls an emotionally charged and compassionate performance as a father dealing with his wife and her near fatal accident. (Played by Patricia Hastie of ""Lost"", basically playing a invalided accident victim - no dialogue at all.)  He needs to deal with the solitude of losing a wife and dealing with estranged children who are remarkably good actors themselves. The oldest daughter is played by Shailene Woodley (""The OC"", ""Secret Life Of An American Teenager"")  and the youngest daughter  played by Amara Miller (in her very first project ever).

What made this movie so good for me was the complexity of Clooney's character and the depth he went to in order to deal with a big family secret, an estranged daughter, a curious daughter and a dying wife. It felt real and heartwarming to see his friends and a new real estate agent and his wife literally turn his world upside down!  Try keeping a dry eye during this film.

The movie feature a completely Hawaiian underscore with classic songs and ukulele strums as well as a realistic look at life in the modern day Hawaiian Islands. The greenery, the land, the ocean and even the never seen rural areas of middle-class homes - all are woven in such detail as to only enhance the story.

The cast includes some other incredible performances by Mathew Lillard (""Scooby Doo"", ""Madd TV"") , Judy Greer (""What Women Want', ""13 Going on 30"")  and Beau Bridges (""Fabulous Baker Boys"", ""Stargate"").

Overall this movie has a lot to offer. Real-life drama and passion and the only thing that might be off setting is that the ""R"" rating for this movie is because of the language. (Which includes the kids.) I can see why it's winning all the awards and the fact it is currently up for  five Academy Award Nominations including;  Actor In a Leading Role - George Clooney, Best Picture, Directing -Alexander Payne, Film Editing - Kevin Tent, and Writing (Adapted Screenplay) - Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash.

A very well made film.",1328572800,7,2370,4.875311720698255
4474621,5,B004UXUX4Q,"Two big decisions that could forever affect your family's future are ahead of you. One of them already made, the other still being debated. Then you're hit with news you never saw coming and expected to deal with it quietly.

  Matt King (played by George Clooney) is lawyer in Hawaii and, by virtue of his profession, the sole executor a family trust that controls 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kauai that they will lose relatively soon thanks to the rule against perpetuities. In addition, he is married with two daughters and their mother has been in a coma for six months since a boating accident and the terms of her living will dictate that she will soon be disconnected from life-support. His younger daughter, Scottie (played by Amara Miller), is unaware and is holding out hope that her mother will wake up. His seventeen year-old daughter, Alex (played by Shailene Woodley), is away at a reform school, of sorts, and stills bears a great deal of resentment for her mother as a result of being sent away. She claims the motivation for that decision was her discovery of her mother's infidelity and says as much to her father. First rejecting the idea, Matt (Clooney) eventually accepts it and then decides to confront the other man in her life, bringing his daughters along under the pretense of a much needed respite.

  Hawaiian music isn't really my taste. Perhaps it's the tone, perhaps it's that I don't speak and could never learn the language. On the other hand, it does set the mood beautifully as do the many shots showcasing Hawaii's natural majesty. Clooney brings the conflict to life with a typically gripping performance and the cast all back him to varying degrees. I will say the part of Brian Speer, the man King (Clooney's) wife was having an affair with was not very well-acted by Matthew Lillard but it's a part with little screen time and few lines so it's forgivable.

...but the acting was poor, the story contrived, and the message was typical Hollywood dehumanizing, misguided, eco claptrap that insults and debilitates all.

When I saw this mess with my wife, I wondered what the big fuss was all about (getting an Oscar Nomination).

None of the acting elicited any emotional response or real enjoyment from me because the story line was obviously contrived that made this movie little more than a political statement... or rather misstatement.

Examples:
* Fortunately, the wife was an adulterer, an idiot, and a fool who had a tragic, fatal accident (all needed); or the main character, Matt King (played by Clooney), would have no opportunity to bond with his estranged (or was it really typical teen-age rebellion with that cancelling any credibility of story) eldest daughter, or there would be no story.
* Fortunately, the main character is named ""King"", so that we would give this character added, but unearned credibility.
* Fortunately, King is a howlie, so that we, evil Whites, can empathize with ""King"".
* Fortunately, King has a connection to part own AND solely manager a large piece of abandoned Hawaiian property.
* Fortunately, King is allowed to say his piece, but stopped others from having their deserved and needed ones to keep the sole focus on King and his upcoming eco decision.
* Fortunately, his wife's adulterer partner was stereo-typical, i.e. sniveling, spineless, married man; who may or may not have had the affair to make millions off of the clueless husband.
* Fortunately, the rat was a businessman so that we can hate him to help support King's emotional eco decision.
* Fortunately, the rat had a ridiculously forgiving wife.
* Fortunately, King is a lawyer, i.e. not a business man, like all of the others that King betrayed with his eco decision.
* Fortunately, all of King's relatives (whose lives King greatly affected with his eco decision) were wasteful sponges so we wouldn't feel sorry for their losses.
* Fortunately for comedy relief, the producers added a clueless, drug taking, moronic boyfriend of the estranged daughter who was allowed to tag along on this severely emotional journey.
* Unfortunately, Hollywood's (read, the Left) used this contrived, poorly acted movie to forward their agenda of dehumanizing the world by showcasing the premise that it is better to abandon the land rather than being good stewards of it - like promoting that it is better to let all trees rot into fertilizer than have them changed into something of lasting beauty (or use) that can be admired (or used) by many, for generations.

I'd rather watch Avatar... oh wait, that one is promoting an agenda, also... but, the scenery is beautiful!",1328313600,12,2739,5.013186813186813
4474634,3,B004UXUX4Q,"Matt King's (George Clooney) wife Elizabeth has been in a coma in the hospital for almost four weeks. She was involved in a boating accident. Also, Matt, one of several descendants of a Hawaiian princess, is the sole trustee of a family trust that controls over 25,000 acres of untouched land on the island of Kaua'i. Matt must decide for his family what is to be done with the land. At the same time, he's given the news that his wife will never recover and she has a living will, so all the machines will soon be unplugged and she will slowly die. So, Matt has to contact his in-laws and all of his wife's friends and notify them of his wife's impending death so that they can say farewell. In addition, Matt is getting used to raising his daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley) by himself. In the midst of all of this, Matt learns that his wife was having an affair for the past two years and decides to find Elizabeth's lover and inform him that she's dying so he can say farewell. Thus begins a mini-journey with his children (and a tag-a-long friend of his daughter, Alex) that brings his family closer together.

The film has some really beautiful scenic shots, but when you're filming in Hawaii, that's not too difficult. The movie also features the finest performance of George Clooney's career. Even though Clooney has starred in lots of tv and film, he's best known for his good looks and comic ability (see O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU) and hasn't had many opportunities to display his range as an actor. THE DESCENDANTS gives him plenty of opportunities. It's his best role to date.

THE DESCENDANTS also features the breakout performance of Shailene Woodley. Woodley is a young actress who hasn't had much exposure but THE DESCENDANTS will be her springboard to stardom. She displays the depth of emotion of a person who has lived several lifetimes.

Beyond the fine acting, THE DESCENDANTS really doesn't offer much. Directed and co-written by Alexander Payne, the film has been nominated for and won all kinds of awards and has been listed on numerous critic's ""Best Of 2011"" lists. I think the main reason for this is because this is an Alexander Payne movie. Make no mistake, Payne is a talented director. I loved ELECTION and SIDEWAYS and even though I find ABOUT SCHMIDT incredibly depressing, it's also fascinating. However, THE DESCENDANTS lacks the life and personality that make those movies so interesting. There are a few really funny scenes in the movie (I don't know why, but watching Clooney run is hilarious), but there's nothing outstanding hilarious. Close to a third of the movie is told in voice-over from King. I don't have an issue with voice-over, but you can't overuse it and it has to be done correctly. THE DESCENDANTS abuses the voice-over. Also, the movie has way too many close-up shots. I realize that it's done for affect, but like the voice-over abuse, the close-up is used way too much in the movie. However, even putting these technical abuses aside, THE DESCENDANTS isn't good movie because it's really not that interesting of a story. The audience is glad to see how things turn out in the end, but it's almost an afterthought. I was looking forward to seeing THE DESCENDANTS, but much like the way I felt after seeing THE SOCIAL NETWORK in 2010 my reaction at the end of the movie was, ""That's it?""

There's some great acting in THE DESCENDANTS, but overall the movie is a tale, ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""",1328140800,,3518,4.734094616639478

Director screenwriter Alexander Payne doesn't wait until the end of his films to pellet you with plate trembling reality shifts. No sir, he doesn't let you off that easy. If you've seen the trailer for The Descendants, you basically understand most of the plot twists because Payne lays his cards on the table early on. George Clooney's estranged wife falls into a deathly coma. Clooney enlists the courage of his troubled daughters in order to reengage decayed family dynamics only to learn that his wife was committing adultery. There, I've said it. Plot ruined.

Actually, that's where the movie begins. Payne isn't interested so much in abruptness as he is with painful realization and its curious road to resolution. As evidence, up and coming teenage actress Shailene Woodley provides a heart-wrenching performance drenched with anger from the bottom of Clooney's leaf contaminated pool. Using the alluring Hawaiian paradise to contrast his story of grief and brokenness, Clooney is burdened with the responsibility of not biting from Eden's apple, however personal and complicated its abstinence proves. Payne absorbs the screen using supporting characters quilted with composite personalities in order to deliver the complexity in the protagonist's ultimate decision for doing good.

'The Descendants' was directed by Alexander Payne, who also was a co-producer on the recently released 'Cedar Rapids'. Both films fall under the rubric of 'quirky indie dramedy' and director Payne seems to be drawn to this sort of quirky subject matter. While the 'quirkiness' and the 'comedy' are present in 'The Descendants', it's more muted than some of the other films Payne has been involved in.

'The Descendants' involves how a family copes after the mother winds up comatose, following a near fatal head injury while water skiing, off the coast of Wakikiki in Hawaii. The husband, Matt King, somewhat mechanically played by George Clooney, is a Honolulu-based attorney who refers to himself as the 'back-up' parent. The first part of 'The Descendants' involves some rather ordinary scenes of Matt attempting to reign in his rebellious daughters (10 year old Scottie bullies a classmate and 17 year old Alex is found drinking when Matt goes to fetch her at the exclusive boarding school she's been staying at).

Matt begins his journey of self-discovery when he's forced to make a decision as the head of a large family that owns a large parcel of land on the Hawaiian island of Kuau'i. The family has seven years to dispose of 25,000 acres before the family trust expires. Matt has openly backed the family majority's decision to sell the land to a wealthy developer, over the objections of many of the locals who fear that the pristine land will be spoiled by over development.

I'll repeat here my definition of the quirky indie dramedy--it's a film that features a ""quirky protagonist, who must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing with the aid of quirky allies, while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo."" The reactionary group here is the developer and the family members who conspire to sell off their land, to the detriment of the community at large. The quirky protagonist is Matt, who generally resorts to inoffensive, quirky machinations, to achieve his goals. The only real negative note that casts Matt (as well as daughter Alex) in a bad light, is when they refuse to accept the apology of Troy, who was driving the boat, when the mother had her accident. Otherwise, he can be found engaging in such quirky and harmless stratagems, such as mouthing off to his comatose wife in the hospital room or giving a passionate kiss, instead of a peck on the cheek ,to the wife of a man who had an affair with his wife, prior to her devastating injury.

When Alex reveals that her mother had an affair with a man, Matt is determined to seek him out. This constitutes the 'second act' of the film and we're curious to see what Matt decides to do. Along the way, Matt gains an unusual quirky ally in the form of Alex's tactless teenage friend, Sid, who ends up being punched in the eye by the comatose woman's father, who holds Matt responsible for his daughter's injury.

Through perseverance and outright luck, Matt finally tracks down the man his wife had the affair with; he's Brian Speer, a real estate developer, who Matt finds on Kuau'i, vacationing with his wife and kids. Fortunately there are no violent recriminations as Matt merely gives Brian a tongue lashing and promises to keep the affair secret from his wife (kudos to the screenwriters for keeping things low key and light weight!).

Things get wrapped up in 'The Descendants' also on a low key note. Matt simply changes his mind and decides not to sign off on having the family sell the land to the developer. There may have been a taste of revenge on Matt's part, since Brian was set to receive some hefty real estate commissions, had the land been sold to the developer. But Matt makes it clear that it's his love of the land that compels him to go against the majority of the family's wishes.

'The Descendants' is very light weight but has its heart in the right place. Not only does Matt get in touch with his altruistic side by keeping the land but also learns to become a better father. The family also is able to 'move on' after the mother is taken off life support. Only the quirky comedy (that's not very funny) gets in the way, epitomized by Julie Speer's rant, at film's end, when she 'loses it', revealing that she's figured it out that husband Brian indeed had been having an affair all along, with Matt's wife.

I'm not sure if 'The Descendants' deserves all the awards it's been nominated for, since a main part of the story, Matt's decision to seek out his wife's lover, turns out to be markedly inconsequential. Nonetheless, the film is mildly interesting, especially in light of the protagonist's self-discovery, where the community benefits and a family is made whole.",1327795200,4,4784,4.733493397358943

If the theme music hadn't been so inappropriately jaunty, if the themes hadn't been so schizophrenic, if the characters had been more believable and sympathetic, if the plot had been coherent, if the film as a whole had a notion of where it was going, if the alky/druggy teenaged daughter hadn't made such a dizzying leap into mental health, if George Clooney's eyeliner had been more subtly applied -- then this might have turned out to be a halfway creditable effort. But noooooo.

As it was, this movie resembled a bunch of trailers jammed together under a common title, all starring the same basic troupe of actors who had read the script months before and promptly forgotten the plot. The director/producer/scriptwriter had conflicting ideas of what they wanted. Not one of the lot seemed to really understand the grinding sadness of the situation.

4474640,5,B004UXUX4Q,"""The Descendants"" is going to be a really big disappointment to people who think that life should mirror the kind of interactions you see on ""Jerry Springer"" or that every movie should include gun fights or car chases. I'll go ahead and drop this spoiler: there is hardly a whiff of any of the above.

George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawai'i whose family is partially descended from King Kamehameha. Although they're now ""about as Haole as you can get"", the family still has the rights to a beautiful and large tract of prime real estate on Kaua'i. As the movie opens the family is contemplating a big decision: the rest of the family are not successful Honolulu lawyers and selling the land will set up the rest of the family nicely.

But the real estate plot plays in the background for the main storyline. As the film opens Matt's wife is in a coma that occurred in a boating accident off Waikiki. The Doctor tells Matt in the opening scene that it is hopeless - Elizabeth King shows no evidence of brain activity and her living will instructs everyone to discontinue life support. The Doctor tells Matt to let everyone know so they can say good-bye.

This begins an emotional Odyssey for Clooney's character. There are two King Daughters: Ten year old Scottie, played by Amara Miller, who is acting out and having difficulty at school after Mom's accident, and seventeen year old Alexandra, played by Shailene Woodley, who was apparently having difficulty before the accident. Alex has been shipped to a boarding school and she is none too eager to reconcile with Dad or cut Mom any slack just because of a little coma. Robert Forster is realistically gruff and bitter as the father of comatose Elizabeth - he blames Matt for being a neglectful husband - driving Elizabeth to the thrill-seeking lifestyle that resulted in the accident.

In his quest to let family and friends know they need to say their final farewells to wife Elizabeth, Matt discovers information that causes a seismic shift in his view of his dying wife and of the real estate deal he has been working on for months.

In this portion of the film special notice goes to Beau Bridges as Cousin Hugh who represents the ""you're not going to let down the WHOLE FAMILY are you, Matt?"" side of the King clan, and Nick Krause as Alex's friend Sid, who shows that in Hawai'i, where type A personalities are as hard to find as a snowstorm, you can't always judge a person's intelligence by their appearance or demeanor. Sid looks like any of the Beach Bums on the North Shore, but in a few telling scenes he offers Matt invaluable insight.

Clooney well-deserves his Oscar nomination for his performance. Matt was never a man of action, and in this film there are a few moments where he specifically chooses NOT to act. In the audience we can see his pain, and we know there are times that a lesser, more vindictive person would have escalated the proceedings with a ""Springer-Style"" knock-down drag-out. But this isn't that kind of movie, and I'm grateful to have not been dragged into the viewing mud.",1327363200,,3079,4.661141804788214

4474642,4,B004UXUX4Q,"""The Descendants"" is a comedy-drama genre film where the lives of the King family is shoved into a state of disarray following the critical injury of Elizabeth King, who is the wife of Matt (George Clooney) and mother to Alex and Scottie.

The tragedy of Elizabeth's injury brings the King family together, and suddenly Matt has to urgently reassess his priorities. Despite their mother's injury the children like any youths are experiencing a confusing stage in their lives and Matt is forced to find caring and leadership skills, which he for years has avoided. Matt already has his hands full as the sole trustee of a family trust, which has ownership of 25,000 pristine acres of land on the island of Kaua'i, and also his normal job as a lawyer.

The narrative is very much focused on a collective path of discovery and transition for Matt King and his daughters, which is at times tragic, humorous, and satisfying for the viewer. Matt's ultimate decision regarding the family trust is influenced by his grief experience, but more so by the clarity he receives after assessing his life.

George Clooney provides a solid performance as Matt King with a convincing screen presence, and the entire cast present as unique and interesting characters.

4474643,3,B004UXUX4Q,"While ""The Descendants"" is well acted and directed, and entertaining on, at least, a basic level, it seems to slip from memory almost as one leaves the theater.

One podcast critic expressed a view that this film is ""a mile wide and an inch deep"".  That, to me, says it exactly.  If I had seen ""The Descendants"" on TV as a ""movie-of-the-week"" I would have recommended it on that simple level, but as a feature film with pretenses of garnering an Oscar, it definitely falls far short of the mark.  (But, if it wins, it certainly won't be the first one to unjustly win the statuette -- anyone remember ""Terms of Endearment"" which I continue to call ""Tears of Endurement""?)

Clooney IS great as he always is but because of the film's shallowness his big crying scene had me thinking the whole time, ""this scene was contrived solely to be an Oscar scene"", as was much of the movie.  In a year that gave us ""The Tree of Life"" and ""Hugo"", this film winning the gold (and it might) would be an uunmitigated farce.

But, farce or not, being overrated is hardly reason enough to denigrate this film.  It's a good one that most viewers will find entertaining.  And well made.  So, I recommend it but, pu-hleeze, don't tell me this is a great film, or even a work of cinematic art!  It isn't.

4474644,5,B004UXUX4Q,"I looked at some of the other Amazon reviews and noticed some viewers found this film boring.  I am not one of them. The film is about a middle aged man who is in crisis because he has life altering decisions and events to face.  This character is played by George Clooney.  Some people when faced with immense land holdings in one of the richest real estate markets on earth, Hawaii, would be wastrels.  Not him.  He is an attorney who supports himself even though he has final power in a trust that involes huge land holdings which came from the original family.  Although these descendants all look white now, way back on his maternal end, there was a full Hawiaan great grandmother who was the heiress,

What he is facing is that all of his relatives want to sell the land and he has that power under the trust.  They do not. Also, his wife was in a boating accident, ended up in a coma and now lays dying in a vegatative state.  She has signed a living will which everyone is honoring. He has two daughters who also must be brought into the picture.  They think she's going to recover.

In the midst of all of the above, his older daughter tells him his wife was having an affair.  He decides to find the guy and tell him what has happened.  The guy is a real estate agent who stands to make a fortune if the land deal goes through,

None of this is played at a melodramatic level.  It unfolds as it would likely unfold in real life, mostly very quietly.  Clooney does a wonderful job.  This is where we all live at some point, where there are decisions and events that will follow us until our days wind down.

There is a small role of the dying wife's father which is really fantastic.  Everyone has experienced this kind of person.  Given the bad news of his daughter's coming death, his sole reaction from there to the end is to lash out and blame everyone.else in the family.  He even makes the accident their faults although the wife was with someone else who was driving the boat at the time of her accident. He never lets up, just finds new ways to continue the attack on others as the day of death moves closer.

This film has Oscar written all over it and I expect it to do very well at the Oscars.  It already won the Golden Globe for best drama.

I was going to give this movie two stars for the scenery, but I just can't muster up another star. I almost fell asleep a few times. There's no plot, it did get a little interesting when the protagonist finds out that his wife cheated on him, but Clooney doesn't do anything with that information, I mean emotionally down deep where the soul lies. Nothing. He goes and finds the guy that the wife had an affair with to give him an opportunity to say goodbye to her since she's about to die. How about punching him or ruining his life or something...it's just ""F U and you better have a better attitude towards me"" are Clooney's character's words to the cheater. Also why was Clooney's character a bad father because he worked a lot, because he provided a really nice home for his family, because he didn't have enough time for the kids. Frankly Clooney's character seems like he has all the time in the world in this movie. Also as a father he seems very approachable. I didn't see any change in the protagonist from the beginning to the end. Same note, flat. This could have been an interesting story if the wife woke up from the coma, but the way it's written it's so nice and neat. Beau Bridges was wonderful, his part should have been bigger and the teenage daughter was good. I was left questioning whether clooney's character didn't sell the land because he didn't want the cheater to get the commission instead of the sanctimonious reason that clooney's character gives. How about some truth, the real side of human nature unless I missed something and George Clooney is now a saint. There is no inner conflict at all that Clooney's character exhibits.

I have noticed in some of the other reviews that subtlety is the new boring, i.e. if you find a movie boring, it wasn't really boring it was subtle. No it was boring.",1326758400,34,1836,4.530120481927711
4474646,5,B004UXUX4Q,"""The Descendants"" is a great movie about a man named Matt King (George Clooney) whose wife is in a coma after a boating accident. Because he's always been kind of a hands-off dad, Matt is unsure of how to relate to his two daughters, 10-year old pretentious Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old troublemaker Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). He's also thrown for a loop when his eldest daughter reveals that his wife had been having an affair before her accident. Matt has to cope with the cold hard facts about his marriage, coupled with his wife's grave condition and the toll this is taking on his family. In addition, Matt's family is pressuring him to sell a large sum of land that their ancestors passed down to them, which is located along the beautiful Hawaaiian coastline. The debate over the land has unexpected connections to Matt's personal situation, and the poor guy has to somehow figure everything out on his own.

I'm not sure if Matt King is George Clooney's best role, but it;s definitely one of them. He delivers a moving performance as a man who is completely broken, yet forcing himself to keep it together for the sake of his two kids. I was also very pleased with Woodley's performance as Matt's teenage daughter. Hers is a very complex role, and the young actress tackles it with grace and honesty. The film itself is incredibly well-done, though extremely depressing. I'm glad I saw the film and I definitely recommend it, though it won't be one of those movies that I'm dying to watch over and over again.",1326672000,3,1530,4.730337078651686

4474648,4,B004UXUX4Q,"""The Descendants"" covers family relations in the wake of an impending death against a backdrop of squabbles over a massive land inheritance.  When money is involved, family squabbles are always at their most tawdry.

George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer based on Oahu with an attractive wife as well as two daughters aged 10 and 17.  His wife is involved in a tragic accident and becomes, essentially, a vegetable.  She is diagnosed never to regain consciousness.

It is during this trauma that King learns that his much-adored wife had been cheating on him.  This comes a terrific shock.  He must manage this trauma while at the same time coming to a conclusion on a family inheritance that dates back to the time of Hawaiian annexation.  The decision involves hundred of millions of dollars and he has to balance the competing objectives of his various cousins who are all potential beneficiaries.

Clooney plays the part magnificently.  He is a struggling parent who is trying to understand his daughters whilst simultaneously managing his own savaged emotions.  He is ably supported by a strong cast playing his daughters, the broader family and friends.  Clooney may well have played himself into an Oscar.  It is hard to conceive that he will not receive a nomination.

I recommend this film strongly.  Yes, it's a tear jerker but it's also a wonderful performance that deserves high accolades.",1326585600,2,1404,4.991379310344827

4474650,5,B004UXUX4Q,"This is a great family film that's R-rated. In it, even little kids say words that would have had my grandmother beating them with a stick for uttering. And yet, honest to Pete, in every other respect it's a wonderful PG-13 family film that endorses family, integrity, good parenting.

And it's a really good movie by cinematic standards, wholly apart from the values it promotes. I once heard that casting was 80% of a movie. If so, ""The Descendants"" wins big time because the casting is flawless. George Clooney sinks into his character--which is tough to do when you're such a big star (and you look like Jay Leno's handsome first cousin). You really see him as his character, and his voiceover narration actually works, unlike many voiceovers.

But the first class casting extends down to the smallest parts--the sign of a fine movie. And the second role, the hero's rebellious daughter, is played with real distinction by Shailene Woodley, previously only known as the lead in the CW network's teen soaper/weekly abstinence infomercial ""Secret Life of the American Teenager.""

The film is set entirely in Hawaii--mostly in the Oahu of those who live there and have lived there for generations, in a suburban lifestyle that looks very much like mainland suburbia except that even the wealthiest families in the fanciest get-togethers are all barefoot. It's pretty cool, really.

Hawaii is one of the best pieces of casting--casting because it comes one of the main characters, providing a backdrop for the human players who are all--hence the title--the descendants of haoles from the mainland and local Hawaiians who intermarried.

One character who has precious screen time is Matthew Lillard, who I only knew of from his role in the Scooby Doo movies--that is, as a rubber-faced buffoon. But here in a small role he does a great job portraying a quasi-slimeball who isn't quite as bad as we're led to think. And Judy Greer, playing the character's wife, does an equally great job with a small role.

The cinematography is competent if not cutting edge. It's aided by being set in Hawaii. Hard to lose with that one. I've been there several times, and the film really took me back. I could smell the warm, humid air and how it makes the main character (Clooney's) sweat when he runs for a while.

This film has gotten rave reviews from the critcs and from audiences. You will do yourself a favor if you see it based on those and this, without trying to find out all the details of the movie. You can get the whole plot easily enough, since most reviews tell the whole story most of the time. I'm trying to help preserve some element of surprise for you here, while still telling you whether you should see it, and whether in a theater or not.

As for that, my rule of thumb is to only see 3D films in theaters rather than on my 46"" flat screen home theater. This film isn't 3D, but I happened to see it in a theater. Some people I saw it with thought the Hawaiian setting was enough to justify seeing it in a theater. I dunno, but that is an argument for it. But I don't think you'll feel bereft if you wait for the DVD.

The same evening we saw ""How to tame your dragon"" on a home theatre, and it made us greatly miss how great it had looked in a theater in 3D, BTW.

The measure of a film, for me, is whether it sticks with me. This has. The characters are so richly drawn, and the actors convey their characters with so much good acting and not all the talkiness that screenwriters like to put in everyone's mouths. I'm talkative myself, but most people really aren't, and I felt the screenwriting here was true to the characters' characters.

Need anything more to decide whether to see it? Well I should add that it's a dramady that moves deftly between comic and very serous moments. At the end, you won't feel devastated. Actually, you'll have trouble not smiling--the kind of warm smile I often give my wife of 30 years after a moment of shared understanding. The film is sophisticated in its characterizations without being at all arch or pretentious. It's an honest movie with a lot of heart, yet without hiding any of the characters' flaws--or, in the case of the more or less bad guys--strengths. Ultimately it has no saints or devils. Just a bunch of people, connected in various way, doing the best they can...in Paradise.

EDIT: I realize I failed here to steer people away from ""The Descendants"" who wouldn't enjoy it. Like the viewer just above this review who gave it two stars for not being the laugh riot he'd expected--and which, frankly, the studio's marketing led some to expect. I added a long comment to his review, addressing his concerns--and full of spoilers, so be warned before you read it!

What I can say here without spoilers is that it's a dramedy. Don't go expecting a light hearted comedic romp! It's got plenty of funny moments, but it's really a pretty serious film. I mean, ""Hamlet"" has a funny Gravedigger Scene, you know?

You also won't like it if you need everything spelled out for you clearly, as TV mostly does, and Hollywood mostly does. This film is subtle, which to the unsubtle looks like bo-ring.

Lastly, you won't like it if you're looking for action. This has no explosions, almost no violence, no car chases, no sex, no horror, no gore, no talky revelations. So you have to pay attention. It's not going to beat you over the head with The Meaning. Life doesn't come with subtitles, and neither does this. It's about family life and a middle aged guy trying to restart his life without making a complete fool of himself (and almost succeeding), set in suburban Hawaii.

4474653,4,B004UXUX4Q,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Nothing new appears in the plot department in ""The Descendants"". For the umpteenth time, we have a successful, workaholic father (George Clooney as Matt King) juggling three problems: 1) attempting to be more ""parental"" with older, estranged, profane daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) and uninhibited younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller), 2)monitoring the comatose, near-death state of his adventurous wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), and 3) as trustee pondering how to dispose of prime Hawaii seafront real estate: sell it and make many family beneficiaries obscenely rich or preserve its pristine beauty. As you can see, Matt's plate is overflowing.

The movie is about how Matt methodically and gradually addresses his three problems. To some degree, ""The Descendants"" is ultimately predictable. However, what is novel is the theme that we almost never act from purely noble, altruistic motives. In the decisions Matt makes, he simultaneously shows patience and exasperation, -self-control and vengeance, reconciliation and resentment.

For example, as he tries to reestablish a connection with Alex, Matt is fumblingly, hilariously, and sadly ineffective. That is, until he learns that his wife was having a clandestine affair. Matt, of course, is fiercely determined to ferret out the slime who cuckolded him, though this ""righteous crusade"" is somewhat tempered by the fact that Elizabeth may have cheated on him because Matt neglected her in favor of work. Perked up by the prospect of this juicy, scandalous mystery, Alex slowly drops her ""sullen teen"" facade and eagerly helps her dad discover that a Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), a real-estate broker, is responsible. Therefore, at least and partially for underhanded reasons, they grudgingly get closer, though as the movie progresses, their relationship improves for more honorable ones.

As another example, Matt finally confronts Brian at his rented seaside cottage about the affair. But instead of getting into a spirited fistfight that would shatter the lawyer's reputation, Matt quietly but determinedly interrogates Brian about his tryst with Elizabeth and informs him about Elizabeth's tragic state. Again, Matt's logical way of handling this seems more humane, but it is also more searingly effective in wounding and humbling Brian, and eventually Brian's wife Julie (Judy Greer), to whom he confesses. It also exposes Brian for the cowardly louse he is, since he refuses to visit Elizabeth on her sick/death bed and sends his wife instead.

Matt displays his ulterior motives regarding the land sale. With his family members, he views the breathtaking property and realizes it would be commercially vile to condemn it to condo development. Therefore, he gathers the cousin beneficiaries together to tell them that he will not sign the land over to developers. But his new-found environmentalism is not the only reason for Matt's decision. He also doesn't want the idle cousins, who never cared for the land in any way and only acquired it through descent, to profit. But Brian, coincidentally, was orchestrating the deal, and Matt REALLY doesn't want HIM to profit.

As the final example, Matt discontinues life support for his wife when the doctors tell him that her head trauma from a boating accident will eventually doom her. Of course, this is an obvious act of charity and a concession to her ""Do Not Resuscitate"" wishes. However, it also gives the all-too-human Matt, his daughters, and his in-laws the chance to vent about her flaws and failures and infidelities without her actually hearing it. Hypocritically, Matt even tries to restrain the others' ventings, especially from Brian's wife, as if only he has the right to complain unreservedly against his wife.  Nevertheless the venting eases Matt's reconciliation with his wife, and makes the post-cremation ash-scattering into the ocean that much easier and truly genuine.

To make peace with the world, we must sort out our mixed selfish and not-so-selfish feelings as we stumble towards some kind of resolution. Even when we make the ""right"" decisions, we often do so for at least partially ""wrong"" reasons. Matt and company learn this anguished and sobering lesson in ""The Descendants"".",1324944000,5,4268,5.359701492537313
4474684,4,B004UXUX4Q,"In a similar vein to his earlier film Sideways, Alexander Payne's The Descendants is a film about people coping. The difference here is that in this film they are coping with the unacceptable and irresolvable. Based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and adapted by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, The Descendants deals with the problems of a man discovering that his wife, who is now in a coma from which she will not recover, was unfaithful to him, with all of the ripple effects that something like that can create.

Matt King (George Clooney) is a lawyer living on the island of Kaua'i in Hawaii. His wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is in a hospital where she lies in a coma resulting from a recent boating accident, and now Matt - who refers to himself as ""the back-up parent"" is suddenly thrust into the role of being the only parent to his two daughters, 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley) and 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller), both of whom are exhibiting behavioral problems. To make matters worse, Matt is told that his wife is for all intents and purposes brain dead and will not recover and, in accordance with her wishes in her living will, must soon be taken off life support. And if that was not enough pressure to be under, Matt happens to be the sole trustee of a land trust worth hundreds of millions of dollars that he must soon make a decision on regarding its break-up and disposition, a decision of enormous interest to dozens of relatives who stand to benefit enormously from the sale of the land.

As Matt begins to let Elizabeth's friends and family know of her impending death, he learns from Alex that Elizabeth was having an affair with another man. Which leaves Matt having to deal with feelings of anger, betrayal, and confusion, with no way to resolve them because the person he needs to resolve them with is in a coma from which she will never recover.

Clooney does a deft turn as Matt, making him comical in the situations where he is clearly out of his depth and yet sympathetic as a man having to deal with anger and hurt seeking answers where there may not in fact be any. Shailene Woodley is outstanding, turning in a bravura performance as Alex who is caught in between:  in between her mother and her father when she discovers her mother's affair, in between her mother and her younger sister whom she tries to protect from the truth, in between her father and her boyfriend Sid (Nick Krause) a genial slacker who unfortunately has the habit of saying clueless things that make people want to punch him in the face, and most of all, in between still being a child and being forced to be an adult by the situation they are all now in. Matthew Lillard's Brian Speer, the real estate agent whom Elizabeth was having an affair with, is an interesting casting choice, putting a likeable character actor in an unsympathetic role. Lillard gives Speer just the right touch, a guy who isn't truly villainous, just foolish. Which is part of the problem for Matt. There are no real villains in the situation, no matter how much he and Alex and Elizabeth's blunt bull-headed father (Robert Forster) want there to be. There are only people who make unfortunate choices, the consequences of which are left to others to deal with.

The Hawaiian setting is interesting in how it's presented, not showing just the usual idyllic version most people have of Hawaii as an island paradise but the current day side of things where rampant development has made much of it just like anywhere else, visually reinforcing a point Matt makes in the film's opening narration:

""My friends think that just because we live in Hawaii, we live in paradise. We're all just out here sipping Mai Tai's, shaking our hips and catching waves. Are they insane? Do they think we're immune to life? How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up? Our heartaches, less painful? Our cancers less deadly? ... Paradise? Paradise can go f[***] itself.""

Note: fair warning to parents. There's a lot of profanity in this movie and about half of it comes from the two girls, Alex and Scottie.

Highly recommended for the performances and for not submitting to the usual easy Hollywood resolution.",1324857600,25,4220,4.670255720053836

Update: after writing the above, I read the NYT movie review, which  belatedly informed me that film  was ""supposed"" to be funny!!! But, how was I to know?

It's true that I was laughing at some scenes... but only because the script seemed so inept and implausible. Bit confusing, eh?

Something is wrong here. IMHO, in many ways,at least for me,  this film does not pass the smell test. Who is fooling whom?",1324771200,8,534,4.557894736842106
4474686,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants is a beautiful film shot in Hawaii. This film showcases the beauty of Hawaii well.  I love the shots of the valleys and beaches.  I live here so this is something I see every day.  George Clooney stars as Matt King.  He is a father trying to raise his daughters after his wife goes into a coma after a boating accident.

 Matt learns from his teenage daughter that his wife was carrying on an affair at the time of her accident.  The daughter is played Shailene Woodley.  Upon learning about his wife's infidelity, Matt chooses to locate and confront the man having an affair with his wife.  An actor named Matthew Lillard plays Brian Speer.  He is  the man having an  affair with Matt King's wife.  An actress named Judy Greer plays Speer's wife.  These characters each have individual scenes with Clooney that are both dramatic and comedic.

  I have an empathy for any father facing the issues of dating and alcoholism with his daughter.  Their relationship is authentic.  The chemistry between Clooney and Woodley is the most appealing aspects of this movie.  I have an empathy for any father and daughter facing these typical teenage issues.

The music is note worthy here.  The soundtrack is filled with Hawaiian music that is playing in the background.  I don't understand a word of the Hawaiian language, but the slack key music is so peaceful and soothing.  The music reflects what living in Hawaii is like.  It is laid back and peaceful.

4474688,5,B004UXUX4Q,"As suave, handsome and debonair as Cary Grant, to whom he is often compared, George Clooney could have coasted on his looks and charm and still made a successful movie career. He's never been interested in taking the easy way out, however. In his latest film, ""The Descendants,"" he plays a troubled lawyer in Paradise, that is, Hawai'i. (One of the many pleasures of ""The Descendants"" is the pervasive but never intrusive presence, through scenery and music, of the distinctive culture of the state.)

Matt King is not your everyday attorney--he is a descendant of one of the island state's oldest and richest families, and the trustee of the family estate on Kaua'i, overseeing an impending sale that will make his and all of his numerous relatives' fortunes. In the meantime his personal life is falling apart--his wife Elizabeth is in a coma after a boating accident, and his two daughters, to whom he has, by his own admission, been ""the understudy--the backup parent,"" are both acting out in reaction to the tragedy. As he tries to hold his family together, Matt is further buffeted by revelations concerning his troubled marriage and its wholly unexpected effect on the upcoming business deal.

Directed by Anthony Payne, who helmed the sleeper ""Sideways"" a few years back, ""The Descendants"" possesses the same knack for drawing easy laughs from the viewer, then delivering sucker punches of emotion just when one's defenses are down. Clooney catches the look of old Hawaiian money to perfection, his handsome visage weathered and weary, stumping around in shorts and aloha shirts. He delivers a memorable performance both facially, in a quiet private speech to his unhearing wife, and physically, in a burst of angry speed as he runs to confront friends who have withheld crucial information from him. However fine the actor is (and the award nominations are already rolling in), he is only the primary player in a strong cast. Shailene Woodley matches him scene for scene as his tense, wary elder daughter Alex, and veteran actors Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, and Michael Ontkean (how long since we've seen him?) turn up, comfortable as old shoes, in subsidiary roles. More prominently, Judy Greer and Matthew Lillard deliver sterling performances as a couple whose lives end up colliding with Matt's.

""The Descendants"" is not a flawless piece of film making--there is a lot of exposition supplied via voice-over narration, and even so there is not enough backstory supplied about either Matt's and Elizabeth's marriage or the business deal that forms the backdrop against which the personal story unfolds. Early on, Alex gains a male friend (not a boyfriend), Sid (Nick Krause), whose presence is ultimately justified in a rather contrived, though admittedly touching, fashion. Still, the loose ends confirm one of the film's themes--that there is a lot in life that is left unsaid, sometimes until it's too late. Highly recommended.",1324425600,5,2944,5.1037344398340245
4474689,5,B004UXUX4Q,"This is Payne's best film since ""Election,"" which I think is the most sophisticated and smartest American film since ""The Apartment,"" in other words: a half-century.  Such words might be interpreted either as high praise for Alexander or simply a damning comment about the puerile film culture in contemporary America.  Some will find ""The Descendents"" sentimental and soft.  I found it excruciatingly layered.  There were scenes in which one wants to laugh and cry-- and tear one's hair out-- all in the same breath.  The characters are perverse (sometimes in ways which feel contrived and slightly cute).  Yet they all attain a kind of dignity.  Some will find this formulaic.  I found it graceful.

If comedy is the highest form of drama,  then what we are witnessing with Alexander Payne is a return to the greatness we used to take for granted in Hollywood.

The Coen Brothers are often cited as evidence that a high film culture still exists, and indeed their greatest films (""Fargo,""  ""No Country for Old Men,"") are impressive.  But (with a few notable exceptions (""The Big Lebowski""),  they substitute a high style for a light touch.  The light touch is far harder to achieve, and Payne is working his way towards it.

Incidentally, in ""The Descendents,""  Payne does pull off a couple of moments of pure visual poetry, especially when he tracks George Clooney as he stalks the grinning real estate goon with whom Clooney's wife had ""strayed.""  They are grace notes in an otherwise utilitarian visual experience (even lush Hanalei Bay comes across as somehow drab in this film)  but Payne's movies offer something far richer than eye candy.",1324339200,,1647,4.945255474452555
4474690,5,B004UXUX4Q,"""My family thinks I'm this giant loser,"" Kevin Spacey informs the audience minutes into ""American Beauty"", the black-humored saga of a man who has lost touch with his family and realizes it only too well, ""and they're right.""  This could also apply to Matt King, George Clooney's character, in ""The Descendants.""  Despite residing on a Hawaiian island, there is plenty of trouble in paradise.  He's in the midst of a real estate deal that the entire island is watching; his wife (Patricia Hastie) is on life support following a boating accident; and his two daughters (Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller) are acting out.  He's never been the family disciplinarian, and their lack of respect perpetually baffles him.  Further complicating things, King realizes that his wife has been unfaithful with someone (Matthew Lillard) who he's never met but has direct ties to the land deal.

This may sound like grim subject matter, but it's handled deftly and with more than a touch of black humor. ""If you're doing this to get my attention, Liz, it's working,"" Clooney says to his wife during one hospital visit.  When a visitor begins to have a breakdown, he takes her by the shoulders and steers her out.

Many movies begin strongly and go downhill in quality; but this film improves as it goes on, and the last 20 minutes had me blubbering (and I don't cry at movies).  The only thing is: that although pains have been taken to make Clooney look like an ordinary guy, I still had trouble believing that he was part of the same gene pool as his movie ""cousins.""  But that was a minor point in an otherwise poignant and heartbreaking movie.",1323907200,2,1633,4.75886524822695
4474691,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The Descendants, a movie starring George Clooney, is the best film I've seen all year. It is adult-themed, realistic and poignant. The dialogue seems real, the acting is superb and the photography of Hawaii is spellbindingly beautiful. The story is about Matt King, descended from King Kamehameha many generations back. He and his family have inherited quite a bit of land for which Matt is the executor and they are in the process of selling it. The proceeds will go to Matt and his cousins. Despite having wealth, Matt has lived frugally, to the point where one might question his motives. His wife, Elizabeth, has just been severely injured in a boating accident and is comatose. It is unlikely that she ever will wake up and her living will is very explicit that she wants her life support pulled.

Matt has two daughters, Scottie and Alex. Alex is 17 and a handful. As the film opens, she is in a private school that may also be a rehab facility. Scottie, about 10, is acting out at school and at home since her mother's injury. Matt is clueless about how to raise his two daughters alone and has been very distant from his family spending most of his time working at his law practice. The crisis with Elizabeth is forcing him to be a primary parent and the film is excellent in showing Matt's development as a father.

Matt goes to the big island to pull Alex from school and bring her home. She is furious at her mother, having found out recently that she was having an affair. She tells her father and the two become co-conspirators in finding Joanie's lover and confronting him. Matt is flabbergasted about the affair. The marriage has not been going well but he had no suspicions that his wife loved another man.

George Clooney is excellent in his part as are the two girls. The movie poignantly shows how the family starts pulling together into a semblance of a loving unit. The dialogue is fresh and real, not for the faint of heart or for those who mind cursing. I have not read the book so I can't compare the two but on its own merits, this film is a real winner.",1323907200,62,2079,4.494708994708994

I'm not sure if that came from author Kaui Hart Hemmings' source novel or from director/co-screenwriter Alexander Payne's pen.

Dictated by state law, he is just about to get his extended family of cousins to reach consensus on selling the land to a native developer when tragedy strikes.

Co-written by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, the main narrative revolves around a boating accident that puts Matt's wife Elizabeth into a coma. This tragedy highlights the fact that King, a workaholic by nature, has distanced himself from his two daughters, ten-year-old Scottie and 17-year-old Alex. Suddenly, he discovers he needs to step forward and confront Scottie's bullying at school and Alex's rebellious hostility. When it becomes clear to him that Elizabeth will never recover, he tells Alex they need to visit family members to give them an opportunity to say goodbye. The strenuously resistant Alex surprises him by sharing that she caught her mother having an affair before the accident. This starts a family journey that gives way to revelations and confrontations which allow him to acknowledge his own failures and make peace with what the future will bring. On the surface, the story sounds like it will turn into a straight-ahead tearjerker, but thanks to Payne's discretion, the emotions the characters express and the situations they face are far more disheveled than that and consequently more compelling.

It's not that Clooney does anything that takes him that far away from his usual screen persona here. Rather, he backseats his trademark coolness to convey a deeper level of vulnerability and confusion as a man unprepared for single parenthood. As Alex, Shailene Woodley gives a terrifically nuanced performance traversing easily between unbridled insolence and supportive nurturing. Amara Miller provides the right level of precocious honesty in her moments as Scottie. The rest of the cast makes less of an impression, for instance, Robert Forster as Matt's highly coiled father-in-law and Judy Greer as the unsuspecting wife of the realtor who had the affair with Elizabeth. The one fly in the ointment is Nick Krause, who appears to serve purely as a comic plot device as Alex's stoner-dude pal Sid. This character is the one major misstep in Payne's treatment. On the upside, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael captures the Hawaiian locations with greater variety than you would expect, and the soundtrack uses purely Hawaiian music to great effect. This is worthwhile viewing mostly for Clooney's work.",1323561600,2,3549,5.656660412757974

That keeps the movie from being simply a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker, and inserts an element of mystery as to how the man will proceed regarding his family's inheritance.

4474696,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The movie business has changed since I was an actor in the 1980s. Now it caters to the junior ticket buyers and consists mainly of car crashes a la Mel Gibson, kung fu a la Jet Li, and juvenile (or what passes for) humor a la Adam Sandler. Well hold on to your hats ladies and gents for what do we have here? Oh no! A movie that deals with adult themes and manages to do so with intelligence, sensitivity, and wit.

Director Alexander Payne (Sideways) really comes through with a winner this time out. His protagonist, confidently played by George Clooney, is a flawed man desperately striving to set his life straight in the face of a dying wife, her infidelity, two neglected daughters, and the self-serving materialism of his family. Clooney is clearly the heart of this film. It is a pleasure to watch as he develops into the finest film actor of his generation. The defining scene of Clooney's performance takes place at the end of The Descendants as he says farewell to his comatose wife. Clooney conveys the emotional depth that we expect from this scene without slobbering or overacting. What he gives us throughout this film is the definition of fine screen acting. The camera finds a diversified reality in the nuances of Clooney's face, often unfairly criticized for being too handsome, as it morphs from near perfection to vulnerability. We believe everything he does and we like him precisely because he is not above making a fool of himself when the script calls for it. Clooney is ably supported by Shailene Woodley as his wayward older daughter, a radiant performance with great variation and insight. Other actors of note are Beau Bridges as a delightfully slimy cousin, Judy Greer as a charming cuckolded wife, and Robert Forster as the grumpy father-in-law.

The Descendants deals with some pretty serious themes. How does one cope with the death of a spouse or the incessant demands of young children? Where does money fall in the hierarchy of values? How difficult is it to take an honest look at yourself? Payne tackles each of these issues with tremendous intelligence, allowing for depth of emotion without falling into the trap of becoming corny or trite. He occasionally plays it very close to absurdity but manages to stay on this side of the line. An example is Woodley's idiot boyfriend (Nick Krause in a jolly, nutty performance) who provides much needed comic relief but in the end turns out to be as real as any of the other characters in this excellent screenplay by Payne, Nat Faxon, and Jim Rash. There were many memorable lines of dialogue, e.g., ""Give your kids enough money to do something but not enough to do nothing.""

I enjoyed this film immensely and was transported by the emotional thrust of the screenplay. Clooney will certainly be nominated and I hope Woodley and the film will too.",1323129600,6,2830,4.759674134419552
4474697,4,B004UXUX4Q,"George Clooney's character, Matt King, is quick to point out that even living on an island paradise doesn't exempt one from exposure to the kinds of messed-up crap that inflict everyone else. Life in its essence is the same for the inhabitants of Hawaii. You just live it wearing colorful shirts, shorts, and sandals. THE DESCENDANTS certainly has its laugh-out-loud bits, but mostly it's a drama about loss and grief and acceptance and all that superfun stuff. And if I were to gauge this film's quality by how often I heard guffaws and sniffles in the theater I went to, then THE DESCENDANTS has earned some big bragging rights. And maybe an Oscar nod for Clooney, and maybe another one for a superb young actress, Shailene Woodley. Both of them anchor the film.

Clooney inhabits his role with a thoughtfulness and an intelligence that not too many of his contemporaries could've matched, and every so often he's not afraid to play the fool (did you check out his goofy jogging?). Mostly, attorney Matt King is just trying to keep his head above water, as he juggles several pressing issues. As the sole trustee of the family's highly coveted ancestral land, there's pressure from his sprawling cast of greedy cousins to sell. Matt is also trying to keep his two troubled young daughters in check, never mind that he views himself as the back-up parent. Most painfully, his comatose wife, Elizabeth, had suffered a grave boating accident, and it's only a matter of time before the plug is pulled, in accordance to her living will. And if you've seen the trailer then you know that his foul-mouthed oldest daughter, Alexandra (Woodley), springs a huge shock on him. In one of her frequent raging tantrums, she informs him that his wife had been cheating on him. Because even paradise sees its share of rocky marriages.

Clooney's restrained performance is compelling and I love his acting choices, the things that he does and how he expresses his dialogue (and there's plenty of dialogue). But I knew Clooney could act. Shailene Woodley is the revelation. Even more than Clooney, Woodley, angry and conflicted and forceful, provides the story's emotional impact. It's a splendid cast across the board, really, from Amara Miller (who plays Matt's ten-year-old daughter Scotty) to a surprisingly grown-up Matthew Lillard to Judy Greer who is absolutely fantastic as the wife of the man cheating with Elizabeth. Nick Krause steals several scenes as Alexandra's st0ner surfer boyfriend Sid. Sid accompanies the Kings as Matt, Alex, and Scotty go island-hopping in search of the elusive other man in Elizabeth's life. I guess it's one way to cope with the impending loss of a loved one. Sid starts out as this oblivious tool but later demonstrates unexpected levels of insight and loyalty. One of Matt King's voice-over observations is that in Hawaii ""the most powerful men look like bums and stunt men."" In a tiny but pivotal part, Beau Bridges plays one of Matt's laid back cousins, and it's worth it to see Bridges not missing a beat as he goes from affable to affably menacing.

Hawaii provides a picturesque backdrop, and it's maybe jarring that we're watching this sad family affair unfolding on an idyllic island paradise. Or maybe that's the conflicting emotion director Alexander Payne was going for. A certain askewed perception. Grief looks a bit odd when the mourners are always dressed for a barbecue. Ultimately THE DESCENDANTS is frank and honest, and sometimes brutally honest. I like that it doesn't pander or try to be cute. The story runs the gamut of laughter and tears, and there's something rewarding in watching Matt and his kids pull together. Elizabeth, the dying wife and mother, is portrayed as a complicated real person, and not put on a pedestal, or not much, anyway. We become privy to her virtues but also to her faults, and the film suggests that Matt, too, is not without blame. And Payne doesn't shy away from exhibiting the degenerative physical toll exacted on a failing coma patient. Each of Matt's visits to the hospital documents Elizabeth's further wasting away. Which sort of wends back to Matt King's point early on. There's no escaping life; it comes with heavy baggages; and death even in paradise is the great leveler. But it's hard to console yourself with that. Me, I'd probably act out, like Matt's kids.",1322956800,4,4349,4.90625
4474698,3,B004UXUX4Q,"I liked this movie - it was solid, the story was complex, the characters interesting and the director did a  fairly good job of keeping it moving.  A few minutes too many of lyrical shots of the Hawaiian landscape, flowers, butterflies...to no purpose except to slow it down so that it was about 10 minutes too long.  The best parts were the two daughters of the George Clooney character:  terrific dialogue, convincing acting and realistic reactions.  Also good were the other supporting players - the older daughter's boy friend, the realtor, the realtor's wife.  I thought George Clooney was less wooden than he was in THE IDES OF MARCH (more on that elsewhere) and he came across as very likable.  What was not so convincing to me was that he  was doing an excellent job as trustee of his family's wealth, as a negotiator with sophisticated developers and as a lawyer.  Just a little too relaxed and off-key to provide any intensity - and, after all, his intensity in work is the reason he is so disconnected from his family at the beginning.  I also liked the travelogue-like bits about the non-touristy parts of Hawaii.

Good movie; if you go with lesser expectations than I had from reading glowing readings, I think you'll like it better.  It did inspire me to want to read the book is was based on.",1322956800,2,1307,4.6347826086956525
4474699,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The enjoyable, moving ""The Descendents"" (written and directed by Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings) smartly depicts how a major development in a family- in this case, a tragedy- immediately steamrolls and negates all petty drama and grievances, and quite efficiently illuminates everyone's true colors and true feelings.

George Clooney is terrific as Matt King, a marginal parent who all of a sudden is thrust into the role of central parent and responsibility bearer when a boating accident puts his wife Elizabeth into a coma.  Things become more complicated when it becomes clear that Elizabeth isn't going to wake up, and that her legal wishes indicate that she doesn't want to be kept alive via artificial means if a situation like her current one ever arose.

Despite the subject matter, the film isn't relentlessly sad.  It's nice to see the strong bond that immediately develops between Matt and his oldest daughter Alexandra (beautifully played by Shailene Woodley), who tosses aside the usual teen issues that drove a wedge between her and her parents in recent years, and starts helping her dad put her mother's affairs in order and prepare for her funeral.

And when I use the word ""affairs"" above, I don't just mean finances and legal stuff.  Matt soon learns from his daughter that he wasn't the only imperfect spouse in their family, though he is shocked to learn exactly what his wife was up to during her last months.

With the help of his family, and one or two hangers-on, Matt puts things to rest during the course of the movie, resulting in situations that are funny, sad, moving, sometimes ridiculous, but always very human.  It's interesting that Matt's forgiveness of his wife's infidelity comes fairly early on (though residual anger surfaces here and there), because there's work to be done. Despite what he's learned, he's determined to put his wife to rest with dignity and love, and to honor her memory properly with friends and family.

Filling out the movie are some beautiful locations in Hawaii, a quirky subplot involving Matt and Alexandra trying to locate Elizabeth's secret lover (despite their negative feelings about that part of her life, they want to give the guy the opportunity to properly say goodbye to her), and another subplot involving a major land deal being overseen my Matt, which ultimately ties into the movie's theme of identifying what's really important in life.

In the end, ""The Descendents"" is an involving family drama that honestly earns the emotions it brings forth. And, really, don't let the premise scare you off.  You'll likely leave the film feeling upbeat and chatty, ready to discuss the film's humor and humanity.",1322611200,4,2708,4.995555555555556
4474700,5,B004UXUX4Q,"I'd read Kaui Hart Hemmings' excellent novel once I heard that it was Alexander Payne's newest project.  It seemed the perfect Payne vehicle: small enough to tell in whole without stripping out key parts (it's notable that Hart Hemmings' work started its life as a short story), featuring a flawed (though not deeply) protagonist at the heart of the story.  Piling this success on top of 'Election,' 'About Schmidt' and 'Sideways,' I can only say: this guy needs to work more.  I can't believe that he waited seven years after the brilliance of 'Sideways' to deliver another gem like 'The Descendants.'

George Clooney has never been better than he is here as Matt King (though I thought his work in the title role as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Clayton/dp/B0014B8KSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Clayton</a>&nbsp;was superb).  He is (as widely quoted in the trailer) 'the backup parent.'  Now, with his family suddenly reeling from a tragic event, King is thrust to the forefront - primary caretaker of two daughters who grew up quickly under his nose - right at a critical professional juncture in which he needs to make a critical decision about his family's stake in large swathes of Hawaiian lands held under their trust and jurisdiction.  How King (and Clooney) handles those two rapidly evolving matters is the crux of the story.

Whenever you read a book and then see the movie, you can't help but compare...

What I liked...

Shailene Woodley - She is stunningly good as older daughter Alexandra.  It's an awesome portrayal.  She's supposed to be model beautiful (check), a bit of a screw-up in her past (the movie gives a nod to that) and - to her father's surprise - a lot tougher and mature than he thought at event's outset.  In every scene with Clooney (and there are many of them), she's every bit his equal as a presence

Hawaii - Hart Hemmings' is Hawaiian, so she doesn't spend a lot of time discussing what makes Hawaii Hawaiian.  Payne needs to do that for his wider audience.  He does so deftly - at the opening in King's voice over in which he tells you that living in Hawaii is not like living in paradise (they have their own concerns like everyone else), in a scene in which they go to look at their property ""for one last time,"" in the houses and neighborhoods he shows (most modestly middle class).  This is the Hawaii of its residents, not its tourists.

Other casting nuggets - Laird Hamilton as Troy (sounding reedy and borderline pathetic as you would expect someone in that situation)...brilliant choice; author Hart Hemmings tucked into a little Easter Egg as Matt's secretary...loved that; Matthew Lillard (Shaggy!) as Brian Speer...an unexpected choice, but pulled off very well indeed (his frozen face when confronted with King is perfect); Judy Greer as Julie Speer (was Payne casting due to the name rhyming?)...always a scene-stealer in supporting roles, she's great here again

Pushing the the wife's story into the background - Here was the major script choice made by Payne: in the book, we come to know a lot more about Matt's wife (she's 'Joanie' in the book, 'Elizabeth' on screen).  We learn that she and Matt were vastly different.  The boating accident that put Joanie in the hospital is very representative of the way she lived her life: loud and and way up on the risk-o-meter.  One passage the stuck with me in the book.  A restauranteur tells him that he ""liked when Joanie came because her presence encouraged everyone to drink more.""  We learn about Joanie's personality in Matt's remembrances (the book is first-person from his perspective).  Payne could have done the same by going back in time and showing them together as a couple.  He chose not to do that.  I think the movie is better for it.  First, he's got two hours to tell a story that unfolded in print over almost 300 pages.  Second, the movie works better with Matt needing to go it alone...he can't be helped by his wife. Her near-lifeless presence brings that home.

What I didn't like...

Matt and Joanie/Elizabeth's relationship - They're depicted here as having been mutually unhappy (the words ""ask you for a divorce"" are mentioned at least three times).  In the book, it's more nuanced.  They were, right from the start, very different.  But Joanie ""always came home with me.""  It was a marriage of opposites that - despite what outsiders might have seen and felt - worked.  Or, rather, always had.  That's why the revelation about his wife and Speer stung so deeply.

Sid - In the book, Alex's friend Sid is a steady stream of surprise to Matt.  He writes him off at the outset as shallow.  Turns out, he's anything but.  In movie, there's a hint of that.  In the book, it's better: it's Sid that calls Julie Speer to the hospital.  In the movie, Julie says she could ""smell it on [Brian]"" (after Matt and Alex's visit). In the book, she relates that ""Sid told me.  He called the house yesterday.""  Matt's response: ""Sid,"" I say.  Well.""  You can feel Matt's respect go up immensely with that one small scene.  I liked that Sid was instrumental in letting that key moment come to pass.

All in all, those are small quibbles.  I heartily recommend this movie.",1322524800,5,5245,4.8382022471910116
4474701,5,B004UXUX4Q,"The local cinpelex was quickly ""sold out"" for an opening weekend matinee of this Oscar worthy film (""best actor"" and/or ""best movie"".)  Clooney is neither a spy, lover or intellegiecnce operative in this one.  Seems to be a wealthy but ""regular guy"" with a regular family who runs into a series of tragicomic events that ring true to the ordinary viewer.  The movie ran for about 2-hours but didn't seem to drag at all. Clearly out of the mainstream for a ""Hollywood"" production but more enjoyable than most. It most certainly deserves all of the positive buzz it's been receiving",1322438400,2,580,4.78
4474702,3,B004UXUX4Q,"The buzz about this film has been Oscar-worthy, but the actual film is a major disappointment, particularly because is was co-written and directed by Alexander Payne, whose earlier films include the brilliant SIDEWAYS and ELECTION, and whose 7-year absence from film has been deeply felt. THE DESCENDANTS feels more like Payne's ABOUT SCHMIDT, which gave Jack Nicholson a good late-career role but was still just another road movie. The film feels underwritten and too often predictable. There is little doubt where we are going, but Payne's journey to get us there is too often uncertain in tone. Scenes and incidents, some funny, others sad, are set up, and then don't pay off. Clooney gives a good, understated performance, but his character's changes, from selfish, stingy, uncaring father and husband, to loving, concerned dad and human being, are never dramatized; we're just supposed to accept it. The whole cast is good, even Nick Krause in the Keanu Reeves role from ""Parenthood"" (the scene where the dopey teen gives advice to Clooney about his daughter is the same as Reeves giving advice to Dianne Wiest in the earlier film). Some times it feels as though the film were too heavily edited, and the missing scenes would have answered all our questions and satisfied our emotional needs. Just hypothetical, but how else to explain the ultimate emptiness of an ""important"" film that just doesn't deliver?",1322352000,5,1413,5.094827586206897
4474703,5,B004UXUX4Q,"Based on the trailers, you would expect this film is mostly a comedy.  After all, it takes place in Hawaii and it stars George Clooney who we see in the trailer running with a funny gate and determined but weird look on his face.  Yes, this scene is in the movie but this isn't a comedy.  It's about a death...and life.

Matt (Clooney) is a wealthy attorney but his real nest egg rests with some large acreage than he and a bevy of cousins have inherited from their families that have roots with a native Hawaiian princess.  The land is pristine and undeveloped.  Although jointly owned, Matt is the sole trustee therefore can decide on what happens with the land.  A plan is in place to sell the land to developers which would provide each of the owners a huge fortune.

This really isn't the main story however, important as it is to the outcome.  Matt's wife is in a non-reversible coma and on life support after a boating accident. She will soon die.  They have 2 daughters, one 17 and another 11.  He's never been overly involved in their upbringing as this was the mother's role.  To complicate matters, Matt finds out that his wife had other outside interests besides boating.

Alexander Payne (""Sideways"") doesn't make a lot of movies but they always resonate.  This one is no exception.  He and his co-writers have put together a strong drama that is never heavy-handed or depressing.  This takes a deft hand at the helm and Payne provides it along with a stellar performance by Clooney and a cast of newcomers (Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller as the daughters) and veterans (Beau Bridges, Judy Greer, Robert Forster and Matthew Lillard).

Blu ray update:  I still love the story and the way director Alexander Payne manages to get great performances from virtually every person on the set.  From surfing legend Laird Hamilton to George Clooney in what must be considered the finest of his career.  One thing the Blu ray allows you to do is study the actors in a closer more personal way as they inhabit their characters.  Clooney's character Matt King runs the gamete of emotions as he tries to deal with multiple catastrophes including the loss of his wife.
The other standout performance is by Shailene Woodley as Matt's oldest daughter Alex.  She goes from a wild partying 17 year old to a mature take charge older sister.  The younger sister Scottie is played by Amara Miller and frankly I didn't pay much attention to her the first time I saw the film.  I was so absorbed with everything else.  But watch this young actress steal scenes and add a bit of needed humor at the appropriate moment.

Even small roles are played for all they're worth.  Robert Forster is the dickish father-in-law of Matt.  But Matt gives him an opportunity to grieve in his own way.  Watch the tender scene in the hospital as Forster's character says goodbye to his daughter.  Check out Judy Greer as the aggrieved spouse of her husband's infidelity.  The husband played by Matthew Lillard is likewise remarkable.  Far removed from Scooby-Doo. Beau Bridges has a couple brief scenes as Matt's cousin, but he takes full advantage.  Finally, you have to give it up for Patricia Hastie in an unappreciated and probably agonizing role as the comatose Elizabeth.  ""The Descendants"" is one of the finest films from 2011.

The Blu ray shows a perfectly presented video in 1080p.  The colorful Hawaiian landscape shows up well with sharp focused detail.  It has a very film-like quality which is appropriate.  The aspect ratio is 2.40:1.  The audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 and while not spectacular it is not distracting either.  This is a dialog centered film and it is clear and centered.  The guitar and ukulele plays in many scenes and they sound great.  Well done.",1322265600,3,3749,4.704615384615384
