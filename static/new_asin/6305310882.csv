8200532,5,6305310882,"Even a big fan of old Hong Kong style cinema should admit that most of the kung fu movies in this genre are basically similar. Kung Fu VS Yoga, however, has distinction to it and is easily recognizable apart from most others.

Our stereotypical, dopey but good-at-fighting protagonist wins a local fighting tournament, and the nobleman hosting the event offers the guy his daughter in marriage. This isn't the suitor the lady was hoping for, so she hits him with a laundry list of epic quests he has to complete before he can bang his new wife, all while she assumes it will be an impossible series of tasks and she won't have to honour the agreement.

The hero and his equally goofy buddy go off on the quest together, getting into all kinds of corny, kung fu comedy style situations along the way. The objectives are to find 3 special items: a book full of mystical Shaolin kung fu techniques, a necklace made of fine pearls and a precious ruby. Each of these respective items are guarded by boss characters. The book, by a Shaolin abbot; the pearls, by a cross dressing hooker/madam; the ruby, by an lndian yogi/guru. The best scenes by far are the attempts to get the ruby from the yogi. 'Singh' is a true contortionist and he pulls off some insane moves while fighting the 2 main characters.

SPOILER ALERT: At the end of the movie when the quest is complete, the protagonist finds out his friend was secretly screwing his wife all along. Big lols, the end, roll credits. Not a happy ending at all, but l guess the brutally smug Chinese directors found humour in it. Definitely one of my favourite kung fu movies after all, though.",1499212800,,1636,4.557823129251701

8200534,5,6305310882,An instant classic. Typically cheesy plot but funny and entertaining. Mind-bending yoga at the end of the movie. I recommend it to any fan of the genre.,1249862400,,152,4.666666666666667
8200535,5,6305310882,Yuet Sang Chin is just awesome in every flick ive seen him in. i don't think anyone gives him credit for how gifted he was. maybe cuz hes so damn ugly. but regardless this flick is great. fight scenes are perfect and when they fight the yoga dude its probably the most amazing fight scenes you will ever see!!! must be part of any collection if you call yourself a collector..especially at this price...,1229644800,,403,4.45945945945946
8200536,5,6305310882,"Ok, so this movie is basically about a buck once alls said and done. You can find that on the ground or between the cushions anyday. That said, this movie is simply the best value martial arts film you'll ever buy. I guarantee you haven't seen a fight scene quite like two guys battling a guy that likely has playdoh for bones. Just buy it so you can say you've got the most far out kung fu movie ever made.",1193788800,2,407,4.1
8200537,5,6305310882,"This movie, which I originally found on VHS back in 1994 at the 99cent store, is quite simply the best kung fu movie of all time. the final fight scene with the yoga master truly must be seen to be believed. ever seen someone fight 2 dudes with their leg behind their head, standing up? didn't think so. thats one of the yoga masters more unremarkable feats. possibly the best twelve dollars or whatever you could ever spend",1155859200,4,424,4.448717948717949
