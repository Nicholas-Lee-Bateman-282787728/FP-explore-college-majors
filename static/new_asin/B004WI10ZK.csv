8445105,3,B004WI10ZK,"A Brazilian / French production ""The Famous and the Dead"" (""Os Famosos e os Duendes da Morte"") follows the story of an unnamed boy (Henrique Larr&eacute;) living with his mother (&Aacute;urea Baptista) in Teutonia, a small town in southern Brazil with a large population of descendants of immigrants of German origin. The townspeople are all looking forward to the upcoming festival, but the 16-year-old boy (whose online name is ""Mr. Tambourine Man"") dreams of going to a Bob Dylan concert that will be held in the city, or leaving this place in any way, even though he does not know how to do it.

One day he encounters Julian (Ismael Caneppele, whose book serves as the basis of the film), a young man who has returned to the town. The boy is attracted to this forlorn-looking guy coping with sad memories of his love ""Jingle Jangle"" (Tuane Eggers).

Sao Paulo-born director Esmir Filho's feature debut film may remind of Gus Van Sant films and his minimalistic approach to the subject matter. The film is distinguished by its poetic beauty and the touching performance from Henrique Larr&eacute; as the young boy feeling that he is stranded in this quiet town. Though set in a rural Brazilian community (that sometimes looks like somewhere in Europe), the film's theme is universal.

In spite of these merits, however, the film feels too slow, and the lingering camera shots, stylish as they are, become almost pretentious. The back stories of Julian and Jingle Jangle (as somewhat timeless existence, whose images the boy watches on the internet site) seem too forced to me. After all we don't know much about Jingle Jangle, so why should a 16-year-old boy be interested in her so much?

Beautifully shot and well-acted, ""The Famous and the Dead"" tells you a story of someone whose life he thinks is going nowhere - a story you heard many times somewhere before.",1334102400,5,1867,4.843260188087775
8445106,5,B004WI10ZK,"I had never heard of film maker Esmir Filho until I caught this little gem of a film at a recent film festival.  I now know that Filho is a noted short film maker in Brazil and The Famous and The Dead is his first feature film.  He creates a truly bleak atmosphere for his main character, showing a life where personal and social growth are stagnated by the situation he lives in.
His work with the young cast is brilliant, showing a deft hand at telling difficult story lines.
A great film, worthy of any art house film collector.",1303171200,2,531,4.3
