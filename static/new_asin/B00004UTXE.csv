1357595,5,B00004UTXE,"Me? I absolutely HATE the English version of Card Captor Sakura... What did they do to it? How can you change one of the best anime/manga out there  into THAT? I own the Japanese version with English subtitles, which I have  been getting from a fansubber, and hopefully this DVD will be much much  better. I heard that this DVD is going to be uncut, and the same original  verision I fell in love with.
The first few episodes revolve around, when  Sakura first finds the magical Clow Cards and meets and guardian Keroberus  (Kero-chan ^_^) and then on to capturing the Shadow card, then a trip to  the aquarium for watery, then on to her ""exhausting Sunday"" when  she is stuck with all the chores.
I hope the new more  ""proffessional"" DVD will be better than my fansubs!",965174400,5,770,4.482014388489208
1357596,5,B00004UTXE,"Cardcaptor Sakura has got to be one of the best animes going for CLAMP besides Magic Knight Rayearth.  Cardcaptor Sakura is a Shojo anime which means it is  meant preferably for girls.  This is the subtitled version and  very different from the WB! dubbed version of Cardcaptors.  These DVD's/  Videos start form the begining of the series and not from the 8th episode  like the dub.  Even if you like the dub I highly recommend this movie even  to those of you who like the Dub, you just might want to see what the  original and you just might like it better.  But to sum it up Cardcaptor  Sakura is a great anime and deserves more than 5 stars!",962496000,12,646,4.336134453781512
1357597,4,B00004UTXE,"Sakura Kinomoto, a 10 year old elementary school student, has been having some strange dreams of a caped magical girl and what looks like a plush lion doll with wings. What a surprise when she finds out she's been dreaming of her own future! Sakura has lived with her father and harassing older brother since her mother passed away. Alone at home one night, Sakura begins to hear some strange noises coming from her dad's basement library. Getting some strange psychic emanations from a book called ""The Clow"", she opens it and reads the words ""Windy"", upon which a ton of cards contained in the book fly out into the night. And what's more, the lion plushy emerges from its empty pages! His name is Kero and it was his duty to contain the Clow Cards, living cards whose power is so great that if left to their own ends, they might destroy the world. He enlists Sakura through guilt and shame, to recapture the Cards, using her newly awakened magical powers. She will also be aided by Tomoya, her best friend, who is her ""Q"", supplying Sakura with costumes and technological gadgets. She also is a bit of a camera otaku and takes it upon herself to videotape all of Sakura's exploits. In a bit of a disturbing touch, Sakura has a crush on her older brother's high school classmate, Yukito, even though nothing legal can ever come of it.

The first thing that you notice about Cardcaptor Sakura is that it is beautifully animated. There is not even ONE shot of a static character with a moving background on this first volume. Something is always moving, whether its Sakura's hair or the wings on her staff. It gives a realistic feel to it that is missing from most anime. I also liked the soundtrack, which combines symphonic music with pop flourishes. As for the characters, once you get adjusted to their annoying little girl voices, they are quite funny. Sakura is quite admirable in that while showing some fear, when it comes to the business of trapping the Clow Cards, she shows exceeding bravery. Kero threatens to steal the show with his Osakan accent and gung-ho spirit which get most of the laughs. All of the male characters show a tendency towards castrati except for Sakura's brother who shows a little more masculinity. What I don't like about the show so far is its episodic nature. Unless it picks up a stronger story arc, it could get trapped into the ""monster of the week"" circle. But I enjoyed this first volume, and knowing this show by reputation, I expect it to evolve.

Just a few extras here: Character info on Sakura, a non-credit opening for the Japanese version and for the lame WB bastardization of this great show. I would also recommend the anime and manga series Ultramaniac.",1136505600,2,2706,4.635416666666667
1357598,5,B00004UTXE,"I LUV this volume, even though Shoaron isn't in here, it will show you how it all started and Sakura even dating with her own crush!
Ep. 1 Sakura and the Mysterious Magical Book
When Sakura comes home from school, she figures out that her brother and her Dad won't be home for a while. When she heard a weird sound in her basement, she looked down there and no one was there untill she found a book. She called out the ""Windy"" card and scatered all the 51 cards! Keroberoes tells her she needs to capture them all back to save the world from Chaos.
CARD USED: WINDY
CAPTURED: FLY
Ep. 2 Sakura's Wonderful Friend
I really like this one about her best friend Tomoyo. Shes a great friend and you wished you had her as your friend!
When Sakura relizes that desks are piled up on each other for some strange reason and Kero calls it as being a Clow Card. One thing for sure, she cant do it alone until Tomoyo is with her! But can Sakura tell her about Cardcaptoring? All the clothes and styles that Sakuras and even Kero recieves. Everybodys shadows start to become stolen when it has to have a weakness. Light!
CARD USED: WINDY + FLY

Ep. 3 Sakuras Heart Racing First Date
O.M.G! It shows Yukito with Sakura going out on a date! Its so Kawaii! They go to the aquarium out on their date. Yukito even waited at the park earlier so he won't be late for their date! But, before they went on the date, some strange whirlpool was at the aquarium when Sakura went on the field trip with her classmates. Sakura needs to figure how she needs to stop it.
CARD USED: NONE (USED AN AQUARIUM FREEZER)
CAPTURED: WATERY
Ep. 4 Sakuras Tiring Day
The title gives you an idea. Its because Sakura has to do the chores today when Touya and her Dad is out. Sorry Kero, you will have to help Sakura with it to. Some parts just make me laugh out loud. Sakura found two Clow Cards! But when the phone rang, she didn't have time to sign her name! Thats when things started to become a disaster.

CAPTURED: RAIN + WOOD
IM TELLING YOU ITS NOT WASTE OF MONEY!! MAKE SURE YOU GET THE MOVIES AND OTHER VOLUMES!",1086566400,13,2109,4.275
1357599,5,B00004UTXE,"Before anything else, a word on the content of the disc:  ""Cardcaptor Sakura"" is a subject of much passion among anime fans, because of the existance of ""Cardcaptors"".  I will refrain from trying to assess and pass judgement on that series here (there are others who do, both in these reviews and on websites, neither of which are hard to find if you want opinions); suffice to say that although CardCaptors is derived from Cardcaptor Sakura, it is not the same program.  This disc (""The Clow"") is presented completely uncut and unedited, with only the Japanese language track and optional English subtitles.  (Hint:  the subtitles are hidden under the Extras menu, and are turned off by default.)
Now, the review proper.  I like Mr. Solomon's characterization of the series as ""sweet but never sacchrine"", for this is really the heart of the matter.  Many anime fans who consider themselves ""mature"" (or for that matter, if they are male) may be turned off by the focus on elaborate costumes, the relentlessly pink cover, and the fact that most of the cast in this series consists of ten-year-old girls.
But, speaking as both a male and someone who watches ""mature"" anime (Cowboy BeBop, Evangelion, Haibane Renmei come to mind), I implore people who might think these things to stop and reconsider.  Despite an outward appearance that may be called ""childish"", ""Sakura"" in fact contains a strong and interesting story with strong and interesting characters.  Sakura herself manages to be an engaging heroine, while still seeming realstic in her tussles with her own day-to-day affairs.
Now, granted, in the world of ""Sakura"", no plot line (especially on this first disc) ever goes completely beyond the ability of the characters to ensure a happy ending.  But at the same time, the anime (the scripts for which were supervised by Ookawa Nanase, the writer of the original manga series) never fails to create tension and suspense even as you're assuring yourself that this show would not let anything truly terrible happen to its inhabitants.
There's even reason for those who have faithfully read the ""Cardcaptor Sakura"" manga to check out this anime--although the basic plot is the same, the actual execution is quite different in both forms.  Cards Sakura catches in the manga appear in different orders and are conquered in different ways, and the anime also involves a number of Cards that don't appear in the manga at all.
The animation is crisp and bright, and the voice actors do an excellent job all around.  But above all, it's next to impossible to watch this series and not feel good.  The energy and upbeat personality of the series comes through everywhere, and is thoroughly infectious.  Not the simple or even shallow show it may seem at first, Sakura can be enjoyed by anyone of any age, and all fans of anime (and of fun cartoons and good storytelling, for that matter) owe it to themselves to give this series a chance.

1357600,5,B00004UTXE,"I've just relized that they changed alot of things in CC. They changed the dialouge into a dorkier way, when Sakura releases her key or card it always ryhmes and sounds stupid, in the end of season 2, Li just said that he goes back to Hong Kong and Li doesn't even give the teddy bear to Sakura! The love is cut out and etc. Perfer getting CCS.
  This story is about an energetic, 10 year old girl named Sakura Kinomoto who is great in baton class and is great in cheerleading. Sakura comes home and heard a noice in her Dad's libary downstairs in the basement. She found a book full with mysterious and wonderous cards. She picked up the first card called the Windy and said it in a clear voice as the cards scatter! Ceroberos or Kero told she has to capture them back with a Key called the key of Clow. Despite her getting into this, Sakura Kinomoto is now the Cardcaptor!
  These are one of the best animes that I've seen. If Nelvana just kept everything just like Cardcaptor Sakura, made a way better opening song, and gave better actors, I would of probably liked it and buy both Cardcaptors and Cardcaptor Sakura.",1081209600,6,1119,4.365384615384615
1357601,5,B00004UTXE,"I was so bored always watching the dubbed version. But this version is so much better. And I have no regrets for wasting my money!! The theme song is so great{a million times better than the Cardcraptors one}. And the ending theme song is great too. I just wish the scenery wasn't so boring, since it's just Kero running around the world. The Saint Tail scenery was even better{not that I'm saying the ending theme of ST was better than the ending theme of CCS}.
In the first episode:
We meet Sakura Kinomoto, a was-normal 4th grader, her father Fujitaka and her brother Toya. Sakura finds a book called The Clow, which is filled with cards, in her basement. She says a card name{windy}and all the cards fly away. Then a little plush toy named Kero tells Sakura she must capture the other cards. Sakura faces her first challenge in capturing the fly card.
In the second episode:
Sakura's friend Tomoyo finds out about kero and Sakura's magic. The shadow card is up to no good in Sakura's school.
In the third episode:
The Watery card is causing mischief at an aquarium by trying to drown people.
In the fourth episode:
Sakura can't go on a picnic with Tomoyo because she has to stay home and do chores all day. Sakura finds two Clow cards that cause some damage around her house.
This series would be great for teens to start getting. Highly recommended.",1076457600,2,1354,4.55327868852459

1357603,5,B00004UTXE,"When I looked at the differences between CC and CCS, I relized that they ruined the show. Cut scenes, love is cut out, changed the dialouge into a whole different story, I relize too that Sakura is anoying in CC. Get CCS version. If your a CC fan get CC then. I don't care who gets what. Anyways, this video contains 4 great episodes of Sakura capturing the Fly, Watery, Wood and Rain, Shadow. Its so cute when Sakura and Yukito go to an aqarium like a little date. Atleast not to Sakura. The best! This is so Kawaii! Funny, full of love, action, and school life.

1357605,5,B00004UTXE,"This entire un-American edited series on VHS can get expensive but if you liked the edited version, you may really like this uncut stuff. Is it edgy?  I guess if one is uptight about sexuality and does not understand this is made in Japan for a Japanese audience.

1357607,5,B00004UTXE,"As you probably know, CardCaptor Sakura is the original TV show from Japan. Those of us who live in USA and Canada have the inadvantage of watching the butchered version of this wonderful show CardCaptors. If you want to see the original, you can buy the volumes seperately, but I recomend you buy the TV series set.
For this volume we have episodes:
1. Sakura and the Mysterious Magic Book
2. Sakura's Wonderful Friend
3. Sakura's Heart-throbbing First Date
4. Sakura's Tiring Sunday
1st episode explains the plot of the story. Sakura Kinomoto is a normal 10 year old girl living it Toemeda, Japan, She is a cheerleader in school and her best friends are Tomoyo, Rika, Chiharu, Naoko and Takashi. She lives with her Big Brother Touya and Father, Fujitaka. Touya has a best friend, Yukito, and Sakura has a bit of a crush on him.
Sakura is coming home from school and notices that both her Dad and Brother will be staying late at work. She is just getting a snack when she hears strange noises from her fathers studies. Armed with a baton, she goes downstairs to investigate. She finds no one downstairs, but when she turns to leave, a book in a shelf starts to glow. Sakura opens it and finds funny looking cards (which kind of look like tarrot cards.) She picks up the top one and reads the name ""Win...Wind... WINDY?"" Suddenly a wind picks up and all the cards blow out of the book, going through the roof and scattering all over the town.
Sakura drops the book in astonishment. While she is looking at the card still in her hand. the book starts glowing again and a small teddybear with wings comes out from the cover. He introduces himself as Keroberous, Gardian beast of the seal. Sakura tells him what happened to the cards, and he tells her thst she has to help him get them back. Keroberous names her a CardCaptor and tells her all about the clow cards. As he is saying this, a huge wind comes through the window. Keroberous tells her it is the FLY card, and as he is saying this, a huge bird flys overhead. Sakura is scared at first, but over comes her fear and captures the FLY card.
2nd episode is basically about Tomoyo finding out about Sakura being a CardCaptor and Sakura goes on to capture the Shadoe card. This is also the first episode for battle costumes.
3rd episode is about Sakura going on a date with her crush, Yukito. There is also continuous trouble with the water card...
4th episode is one that made the lame Cardcaptors dub. Sakura is stuck at home doing chores when she finds two clow card that have been blow under furniture in her house. But what is this tree sprouting from the basement...
Do me a favor and buy this volume or the CardCaptor Sakura TV series. It is definently worth the money. Episodes are subtitled in english and all the voice acting is really good. I really appreciated Tange Sakura preformance, although all the rest were good too. An excellent TV show that unfortunatly was not shown here in North America.

1357608,5,B00004UTXE,"This is one of my favorites! ""Cardcaptor Sakura The Clow""! This is what its about. A 10-year-old girl named Sakura Kinomoto who broke the seal on a magical book called ""The Clow"". She opened the book up, picked up the first card called ""The Windy"" and all of a sudden she said the word windy and poof!! All the cards shoot away! Keroberos (Guardian Of The Clow Cards) told Sakura that she had to capture all the fifty-two cards back before the world gets destroyed! Sakura did not want to at first but she has to and if she doesnt then who is going to capture them and bring the world in piece and harmoney? This includes four  episodes.
1.) Sakura and the Mysterious Magic Book
2.) Sakura's Wonderful Friend
3.) Sakura's Heart-Racing First Date
4.) Sakura's Tiring Sunday
This is a cute video. This is probley in japanese but I think there the best of them all.",1053820800,,862,4.455696202531645
1357609,5,B00004UTXE,"When I got this video I was mad at first because this was in japanese and I didn't know what subtitle meant. Then when I started to watch it and started to relize that this is much better than dubbed, I started to watch it over and over. It is so funny. I like Kero, he is funny. Get this! (If you want) I am a big fan of Cardcaptor Sakura. Also, did you know that I watch it in my bedroom and act like a Cardcaptor.;) Well this is about Sakura who scatered this book of cards. So, Kero The Guardian Beast tells Sakura she had to capture fifty-two cards before they destroy the world! Sakura had to use a staff called The Clow. (I think thats what its called) Anyways, this is a nice video! Also, your children can read the english subtitle down on the bottem of the screen. This includes 1-4 videos.
1. Sakura and the Mysterious Magic Book. 2. Sakura's Wonderful Friend. 3. Sakura's Heart-Racing First Date. 4. Sakura's Tiring Sunday. Each video contains Sakura capturing a card. For the first video she captures the Fly Card with the Windy card. The second video Sakura captures the Shadow Card with the Windy card. The Third episode Sakura captures the Watery Card by going to the aquarium and going in this freezer place. (Its hard to explain) The fourth video is where Sakura captures two cards called the Wood Card and the Rain Card. Sakura uses the Watery Card to capture the Rain Card. For the Wood she doesnt use any card because it is a gentle card. Well thats all I can say. Enjoy!",1050105600,3,1492,4.351254480286738
1357610,5,B00004UTXE,"I tryed to be cool and resist cardcaptor Sakura but in the end I fell in love with it and nothing would stop me from buying this DVD.  That aside, CCS is quite possibly the best anime in years.  The animation is livey and vibrant while the story itself is cute and simplistic. Do not be fooled by its apperence Cardcaptor sakura is much more sophisticated than it seems.  Do not miss this title, I assure you it is worth every dime you pay for it.",1045008000,,447,4.174418604651163
1357611,5,B00004UTXE,"I watched the dub on TV and own them on video. I didn't know about the Japanese version until very recently. But when I found that you could buy the DVD from Amazon.com, I decided to try it out. The first four episodes of the sub version were brilliant! Way better then the dub!.
My favourite characters on the sub have to be Kero-Chan and Sakura!
I love the Osaka accent of Kero-Chan which he says he has at the beginning when he comes out of the Clow Book.
Is he a male in the sub version? He sounds like a she.
The first thing I noticed about the difference between the sub and dub is that the dub had loads of scenes cut out from the sub. And the original Japanese words were changed to make it as though it sounded like a competive and a more boy like show. But the sub is really for girls!
And CCS is now one of my top favourite animes!",1041292800,,842,4.017857142857143
1357612,5,B00004UTXE,"I was first exposed to matters of the Clow through the Kids-WB (Saturday morning Cardcaptors) and wasn't impressed. I felt that it was a series worth watching (which I did on a regular basis by the way) but not spend money on. That is until I ran across a few fansubbed episodes of Cardcaptor Sakura then realized that there was much more to it after all and immediately fell in love with the series. I was horrified to learn that Nelvana took a wonderful series with charming characters and a coherent story and turned it into a faint shadow of its former self.
After running through the fansubs, I immediately bought a few of the Cardcaptor Sakura DVDs and over a span of a few weeks got all the rest of the DVDs that I could lay my hands on.
Do yourself a favor. Get Cardcaptor Sakura and forget about that other pretender. It may only be subtitled but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It might even encourage your kids to better their reading skills :)",1038960000,,967,4.468926553672317
1357613,5,B00004UTXE,"If you're a fan of the show when it aired on KidsWB, then you'll love this undubbed, uncut, original version as it was seen in Japan. The voice actors and actresses portray these characters extremely well and Kereberos (Kero) is so kawaii, (Kawaii means cute in Japanese). The best part is that there is an option to display the English subtitles, so you can understand what the characters are saying. All in all, this is a must have for all anime fans out there.",1034553600,,463,4.523809523809524
1357614,5,B00004UTXE,"It seems completely unrelated, but Cardcaptor Sakura reminds me of the famous letter that goes, ""Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.""  There is no content in common but it's not the content that brings about the similarities - it's the refreshing innocence and joy that comes with each episode that you watch.

THE CLOW is the first DVD in the series and leaves you wanting more and more.  Sakura is an adorable little girl who finds herself the Cardcaptor after she accidentally releases the Clow Cards.  Though she doesn't really want to at first, Sakura finds herself a good choice and gradually starts to get better at it, especially with the encouragement of her guardian, Kero-chan.  When her best friend Tomoyo finds out about the secret, she gains another ally - though sometimes Tomoyo can go a bit overboard.

Sakura's brother, Touya, and his best friend, Yukito, also help round out the main cast of this DVD.  Sakura has a crush on Yukito, and the episode where they go to the cafe together is absolutely adorable.  We also meet Sakura's father and it really becomes evident just how much Sakura loves her family and her friends as she upholds her responsibilities towards them.  As Cardcaptor Sakura is shoujo, the relationships are just as important as the action and while they're easy to understand, they never fail to make you smile or even laugh.

Cardcaptor Sakura has rapidly become one of my favorite animes because it makes me smile without fail.  There's always something new or cute to see and it doesn't matter how many times I've seen it - it doesn't lose its charm.  I fully recommend this series to anyone who likes anime and those who don't know if they do or not.  It's a must see!",1032134400,,1714,4.6923076923076925

1st EP. You meet all of Sakura's family including the boy she has a crush on Yukito and her best friend Tomoyo. Then she goes home from Cheerleading practice I beleive and she hears something in her dads study and she goes down to see then she sees a mysteriouse book glowing and she picks it up.

Yes,i am ashamed to say i was one of those brainwashed people who thought the sub and dub were the same thing. In fact,i heard of Cardcaptor Sakura shortly after 'Cardcaptors',the butchered dub of CCS,was aired. Soon,i started to find out all i could of the sub. I decided to order this video to see if it was as good as everyone said it was. And,that was one of the best decisions i've ever made.(Yes,i AM that obsessed `-___-;;;;;)
I recomend Cardcaptor Sakura to ANY anime fan. I guarantee you will not regret your decision in ordering this video.
This video consists of the first 4 CCS episodes:
1)Sakura and the Mysterious Book
2)Sakura's Wonderful Friend
3)Sakura's heart-Racing First Date
4)Sakura's Tiring Sunday
If you are a fan of the dub,i'm SURE you will like the sub even more.
The only problem would probably be if you don't like reading your anime(The show is in Chinese *well,DUH* and though i can understand most of it,people will probably NOT understand it,because you're probably new to Chinese?)But,a little kid can learn to read while watching this wonderful anime! And,if you're used to watching fansubs,and are used to reading your anime,you really haven't got a problem ^^;;;;;
So,i repeat,i recomend this video for anyone.
So sit back and enjoy!^^;;;

1357617,5,B00004UTXE,"Cardcaptor Sakura is, without a doubt, one of the best Anime shows on the U.S. market today.  It involves a 10-year old girl named Sakura who just happened to open a mysterious magical book containg powerful objects known as Clow Cards.  With the help of that totally cool, flying dude known as Kero she becomes the Cardcaptor so that she can capture all the Clow Cards.  One of the many things I like about this series is that Sakura doesn't instantly know everything about being a Cardcaptor.  She actually 'learns more' as the series progresses.

There are a few very funny moments, and a lot of jokes that might just get a smile.

1357619,5,B00004UTXE,"This is the anime that shows why there are so many anime fans.
The animation, the artwork, and the storys told in the best animes always go beyond what passes for entertainment here in the states, and this one shows just how bad some of the translations to american can be.
This series is known as ""cardcaptors"" here in the states, and after having seen the japanese originals, and can say that this one was literally BUTCHERED during the translation.  In episode one for instance, you see scenes that appeared in later episodes of the american version, and it's now obvious to me that the very heart and soul of this great anime was gutted in favor of trying to 'boyify' it.  Since the show is about a little girl and mainly follows her exploits, the powers that be that tried to translate this show saw fit to re-edit the entire series, taking bits from totally unrelated episodes and making an almost unrecognisable mess.  I had watched the nelvana american version and most of the time I was totally bored with, but someone suggested that I get the original series, and I am surprised at how much more fun it is to watch.  From the japanese 'wild takes' (with the tradmark sweat and curly Q eyes), to the music and artwork, as well as a much richer and deeper story, (not to mention longer).  If you are now just getting into Cardcaptors, chances are you are getting intersted in this version, and you will not go wrong getting it.

1357620,5,B00004UTXE,"One of my favorite things about mahou shoujo is the consistent attention to the feelings and issues around children and emphasis on friendships.  In CCS there is no exception and in the tales about Sakura, a typical 10-year old, these wonderful themes are presented in spades.  Sakura discovers a magical tome in her father's downstairs study she unknowingly releases all the clow cards, except one.  What follows afterwards, and throughout the series, is the adventure to return all the Clow cards, which are powerful magical entities, back to the Clow book.  Sakura learns a great deal in these--and all upcoming--adventures and experiences, and, as with most anime, the human equations are very well expressed.  This is definitely an anime worth adding to your collection.",1012521600,,775,5.217741935483871

I myself introduced my nine-year-old cousin to the series (I refuse to let her watch the WB's ""Cardcaptors""), and she has become a devoted fan.  More than just a silly cartoon about capturing cards, CCS has endearing characters of all ages, drama, humor, romance and some heartbreak- more towards the second season, when the series becomes less episodic and more dramatic.  While appropriate for children of elementary school age, older shoujo anime fans will find ""Cardcaptor Sakura"" just as entertaining.",1009152000,2,672,5.261682242990654

""Cardcaptors"" is the mangled, cut up, mutated version of this very, very good anime.  OK, let's get down to the details.  Basically, it's about a 10-year old girl named Sakura Kinomoto, who released 52 ""Clow Cards"" and has to capture them all with Keroberos, guardian of the Seal.  The extras on the DVD aren't great, but when you think about it, it is the best they could do.  There is the option of turning the subtitles on or off, you can see the opening song ""Catch You Catch Me"" without credits, a small biography of Sakura, the WB opening (Stupid), and DVD credits.  There is no English version on this DVD because it is so cut up and messed up that there's no way these four episodes are even IN English.  All in all, a great DVD, and a unique anime.

Well I bought the first two DVD's and I loved it, so did my husband(which says a lot because he usually doesn't like anime) RIght now the series is more comidic than serious, but it's cute. I love Kero, and even though this DVD doesn't come in English dubbing it was still worth it, in fact I think it was better, you just have to get used to watching the subtitles and watching the picture at the same time, but it's not too bad.

Even though I was first introduced to this anime by the English dub, I immediately checked out the anime in its original version to compare the difference. Much to my surprise, Nelvana mixed the episodes all around and made 2 main characters instead of 1. The reason I think that they did it because it was showing on the WB where little kids watch Saturday morning cartoons, and some of the episodes had not so kiddish topic like same sex attraction, but that was resolved later on in the series. Ok now for the review on the DVD. Pioneer did an excelent job bring the series to the States in it's original form. Although the extras didn't have much except the Japanese intro and the English intro. The DVD has the first 4 episodes on it and during each other intro, they show the romanized of japanese characters in the subtitles and the other intros they had the translation. Episodes were clear and sound was crisp. I would recommend this for anyone who's a fan to the series, and would like to see it in it's purest form.",1006473600,5,1115,4.41747572815534

I was frankly dissapointed when he pulled it out of the package in his gift offering. I had unfortunately seen the horribly mutilated american translation, and despite knowing that most anime is butchered when released statewide, I never realized how badly they could ever mame anything as sacred as this show has become to me. Clamp's animators weave the most beautiful story of a little girl who has the typical hopes and dreams of every little girl. Why, in gods name, Nelvana believes the American public cannot accept a female heroine is beyond me. Because this anime hits you where suprisingly few girls anime hits you, in the dead center of your heart. I won't get started on Kero. I steadfast Mokona of Rayearth fan, I had to bump the little marshmallow puff for the bearcub eared Kero and his famous Osaka accent! But in a final statement, anyone with even a glimmer of an interest in anime.

Luckily, the episodes on this DVD weren't butchered up and thrown together into a worthless DVD. This is full of great stuff.
The first CCS episodes are by far, the best. You get to see some of the cutest faces on display that are usually drawn in the CLAMP manga. Kinomoto Sakura (pronounced Sah-ku-ra) is a normal grade 4 student with a meanie older brother (Kinomoto Touya) and a caring father (Kinomoto Fujitaka-san). Her mother (Kinomoto Nadeshiko) passed away when Sakura was 3 years old. One day, Sakura opens a book called the Clow (pronounced like ""clover"") and accidentally unleashes the Clow cards. A little creature named Kerberos pops out. Surprised that the cards are gone (well, he was supposed to guard them, but fell asleep for 30 years), he tells Sakura she must become the ""Cardcaptor"" and find them. Amongst some of the cards highlighted are WINDY, WATERY, WOOD, and (gomen!) I forgot the other ones. Luckily, she's got her best friend (Daidouji Tomoyo) for support. Syaoran Li isn't introduced into these episodes yet, but you won't be disappointed.
The extras are slim, but they are worth a look. There's the subtitles option (built especially for non Japanese speakers), a non credit opening of ""Catch You, Catch Me"", the disappointing opening to ""Cardcaptors,"" and a Character Intro.

1357629,5,B00004UTXE,"Hmm...where do I start? For those of you who don't know, Cardcaptor Sakura is the TV series based on the CLAMP manga series of the same name. The skeleton of the story is that of a 10-year old girl who finds a mysterious book of card called the Clow (pronounced like ""Clover,"" not like ""Cow"" as they do in the god-awful American ""Cardcaptors"" version). These cards are much like real people in the sense that they have personalities and desires. After escaping, a small little creature called Keroberos (not Cerberus, as some people think) tells her that she must become the one-and-only Cardcaptor Sakura to capture them before they mess up the world beyond repair. After capturing them, they become Sakura Cards.
  Along the way, Sakura accepts help from her slightly insane friend, Tomoyo (NOT MADISON!). That's right. Insane.
  She also has an innocent crush on her brother's ""friend,"" Yukito (not Julian Star.) Well, let's just say that Yukito doesn't decide to reciprocate romantically
  Sound like another ditzy shoujo anime? Yes, we'd all like to think that. Below Cardcaptor Sakura's fluffy, girly exterior is an incredibly deep and understated series. Seriously, CLAMP has redifined the word ""subtlety."" Although the serious complexities are not shown particularly much during the first 4 episodes, this is a very good DVD and you should definitely get it, unless you saw some ... ""Cardcaptors"" commercial and think that it is an action cartoon.
  Well, that is it. What a breathtakingly incredible series this is, so you should really get it (trust me, things really pick up by even the next DVD). Cardcaptor Sakura: Buy me! Buy me!
PS: Whatever you do, do not confuse Cardcaptor Sakura with Cardcaptors. The latter really is a pathetic dub in which all of the relationships are twisted into different things. Sakura is the ONLY Cardcaptor (sorry, I am quite jaded when it comes to dubbed anything).",1001203200,7,1910,5.003154574132492

In the first four episodes, the characters develop nicely, from an unwilling Cardcaptor Sakura to her best friend Tomoyo. And there is just something about watching a subbed anime that makes it sooooo much better. The voices are definitely a better suit.
Basic storyline? Sakura is a relatively normal 10-year-old girl, in fourth grade at Tomoeda (sp?) Elementary. After breaking the seal on the Book of the Clow (pronounced ""clue"" not clow), she speaks the name of the Windy card, scattering the rest of the Clow cards all over the city.

1357633,5,B00004UTXE,"I found the dub ""Cardcaptors"" on Kids' WB and started watching it just out of curiosity - imagine my surprise to find that this cute show was also thought-provoking, mature beyond its appearance, and just GREAT! Even so, right away I could tell we weren't getting the whole story - they introduced Sakura & Li right away and talked about the Cards, but didn't even bother to give us the back story?! I kept waiting for it, but it never came...
...and then I found the series on DVD - the original, UNCUT version! Finally, I could find out what I'd been missing! ""But I have to watch it in Japanese?!?!"" I rebelled. Last month I finally broke down and got Vol. 1 to try out (same purchase, I started collecting the bilingual ""Escaflowne"" discs - HIGHLY recommended); it took some getting used to, but now I'm loving it! Nothing is cut, I'm getting the whole story, the show is even better, and I may even be learning some Japanese. ;-D I even now *prefer* the Japanese voices of Yukito & Toya, who I originally got to know as Julian & Tori, even though I don't understand them without the subtitles. LOL
I wouldn't say the dub ""totally ruined"" the show, but yeah, it is a BIG difference - take ""Sakura's Heart-Racing First Date"" (originally Ep. 3, called ""Allies"" in the US): because the dub eps are being shown totally out of order so they can *try* to focus on Li, they totally rewrote this episode! Not so bad in and of itself, but in the process they completely cut every scene having to do with Sakura's totally cute and realistic (as in, ""every ten-year-old has one"") crush on Yukito (Julian), her brother Toya's (Tori) best friend! After I'd seen the sub version 2 or 3 times, WB reran that ep on Saturday morning, and it was down right painful to watch, knowing what they'd changed.
I still watch the show Saturday mornings on WB, but now there's always a nagging thought in my mind - ""I wonder what I'm missing? What will be different when I see this on DVD? How will it be better?"" - I still enjoy the dub, but the anticipation for the sub may drive me nuts. ;-)
Oh yeah, and this is coming from a 22-year-old, so the show is definitely enjoyable across many ages. It's so refreshing to see a strong, intelligent, not-so-whiny female lead, even a 10-year-old.
Don't be like I was and let the language barrier hold you back - get the sub! You will not regret it!",997056000,,2370,4.425629290617849
1357634,5,B00004UTXE,"... although I have to say that ""Cardcaptor Sakura"" is not strictly for the kiddies (Harry Potter, anyone? C'mon, I know a bunch of your 30-somethings read those books, too!). Sakura is your average Japanese fourth-grader, until she unwittingly releases some troublesome demon-posessed cards from an old book, along with its familiar protector, Kero-chan (a smart-mouthed and decidedly cuter sidekick than ""Sailor Moon""s cat). What follows is a delightful romp as Sakura tries to re-capture all the cards. She gains allies along the way with her friend Tomoyo (""Madison"", in the US dub) and Li Shaorun (although sometimes Sakura's not sure whether or not he's a real ally; the kid, who's been raised a cardcaptor by his family, has a real ego).
The series boasts top-notch animation for a TV-series, even by Japanese standards (and I've watched a lot of anime), and the dialogue is neither stale nor repetitive. Even though each episode deals with a card capture, the writers managed to make each day new and interesting rather than a repeated ""Oh, lookie, Sakura's going to capture another card"". In fact, some episodes feature a capture as just a brief side-plot with the focus on Sakura's relationships, worries, or other points of pre-adolescence. This is everthing ""Sailor Moon"" should have been, but wasn't.
""Sailor Moon"" was a cute show, but really one-dimensional in a way only six-year olds could really enjoy. I admit, ""Sailor Moon"" is cute and I watched it when I was little, but it doesn't contain the depth of character, plot, and animation as ""Cardcaptor Sakura"". What makes Sakura so endearing is that she's quite capable, and even when she screws up she fights it out. One of the most annoying habits of ""Sailor Moon"" is how the lead character is saved or at least aided practically every time by the dashing male lead, Tuxedo Kamen (""Tuxedo Mask"", in the US dub). Sakura proves that a girl can kick butt thoroughly.
Also, in Sakura's world, people are not perfect or one-dimensional. Li Shaorun can be a brat (and eventually evolves to crushing on Sakura as the series progresses), but he's that way because of his background. He's been ingrained by his family to capture cards, and at first he sees Sakura as an amateur rival who he doesn't need (he actually feels threatened by her presence in the beginning). Tomoyo, an amateur film freak, drags her videocamera everywhere to film Sakura's captures, and has a few stints of her own. Even Kero, with his sharp mouth and love of video games, and Sakura's older brother, a true pain in the butt (in an endearing and entirely lifelife way), makes the series all the more realistic and worthwhile. Unlike ""Sailor Moon"", here there are no ""throwaway"" characters, even Sakura's band of clueless schoolfriends. Nobody and nothing here is fluff.  Also, all the ten-year olds have the quirky youngster bodies we all hated having at that age: skinny, with gawky big legs (whereas in ""Sailor Moon"", everyone is gorgeous and all the girls weigh 72 pounds).  Plus, there aren't any fuschia-haired characters in ""Cardcaptor Sakura"", something I like; the ""realism"" factor in this show is quite high.
This series is a definite recommendation to everyone, but my advice is to buy the DVD volumes rather than watch the American TV version. Unfortunately, the American dub doesn't even include the first eight episodes, so you don't even see Sakura accidently freeing the cards!!  Volume 1 starts the whole series off, and it only gets better from here.  I HIGHLY recommend them.",995760000,4,3530,4.95777027027027

Kero -guardian of the cards- in his smaller form comes out of the book to aid her in the recapturing of the cards. Her father has no magic in him, so he couldn't open it - but Sakura does! She has a father (Fujitaka), brother (Touya) who is ... although the American version cuts that out, best friend (Tomoyo) who is very rich and makes Sakura outfits for every card capture, and deceased mother (Nadeshiko).

This is one of my most favorite anime titles of all time. Not only does it have cute, original characters, but the storyline and subplots are cute and original as well. The series starts off simple: A newly found magical girl and her cute animal sidekick. Having to fight strange creatures inorder to keep peace in the world... But no sooner do you get to the eighth episode does the story get REALLY interesting. Honestly, I was *most* compelled by this series when it got to the second season (episode 36), when the storyline is more intense and less ""cute"" as the beginning is... What unfolds will keep you interested up till the last episode.
The animation is top-notch, and the music is just as good. This DVD provides us with the original japanese track with subtitles, and really not much more than that...

The first episode has how it all began, with Kero-Chan's snoring grabbing the attention of young Sakura, leading her to the ""Clow Book"", which she manages to open, and no sooner does she read the name of the first card, ""Windy"", do the rest of the cards zip away! A moment later Keroberos arises from the book, and explains who and what he is to Sakura, only then noticing the cards are gone(""Well, I read the name, Windy, and there was a big gust of wind, and they all flew away."" ""Oooh. WHAAAAT!!!!""). Sakura must now be the Cardcaptor, and clean up her little mess. This leads to to the capture of the Fly card.
  In episode two, Sakura must catch the Shadow card at her school, and deal with the fact that her best friend Tomoyo(Madison in the Dub) caught her first flight on Fly on film! Tomoyo is actually quite undisturbed by the concept of her friend being a Cardcaptor, going so far as to ask, ""Do you have a trademark pose yet?""
  In the third episode Sakura gets to go on a ""date"" with her long time crush Yukito(Juilian in the Dub), but gets disturbed by the machinations of the Watery card! Sakura has to put all her brains to the test when Kero strongly states that the cards she has so far will be useless against this elemental spirit!
  To finish the disc, Sakura faces the ultimate horror - SUNDAY CHORES!! During which she finds that two of the cards, the Wood and the Rain, never actually left the house! Unfortunately, Rain wakes up and decides to play with Wood, and...
  So for the serious and horribly addicted Anime junky, do not miss this DVD! It's a hoot and shows how one of the most unique ""Magical Girls"" got started, and why! Kudos!

I love this anime; it is very kawaii (meaning ""cute"" for those of you who can't understand Japanese).  The story is about a 10-year-old girl named Sakura who ends up scattering these magical items called Clow Cards.  After the cards gardian wakes up to find out that the cards are gone, he assigns Sakura with the job of recollecting these cards before a great catastrophe occurs.  Lots of cute things happen in this anime, hence the reason why this review is called ""kawaii"".  I love the cutness of this series, and it has a delightful sense of humor.

1357649,5,B00004UTXE,"Wow. To start off, I'll say that when I first say CardCaptors (english-dubbed) on Kids WB, I loved it. Everyone and everything was so magicial, cute, and well-drawn (thanks to the all-holy skills of CLAMP)! But I was feeling a bit leftout (did you know that Kids WB's CardCaptors started at episode -8- of CardCaptor Sakura? Nothing goes in order at all, in their version!) so I bought the Japanese subtitled version.  Oh. My. God. If, on a scale of 1 to 10, I liked CardCaptors at a 1 before that moment, I was automatically moved up to a 10. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ANIMES YOU -MUST- SEE IN IT'S ORIGINAL FORM. It is truly awing. The voices are just heavenly, the music is beautiful... And the DVD quality makes CLAMP's artwork sharper and more lovely.  To put it shortly, no one should NOT see these episodes.

1357650,5,B00004UTXE,"Eh, yeah...Cardcaptor Sakura can be summed up in one word all otaku can understand fully....KAWAII!!! I rented the tape from my local anime store (as I read the manga and have seen the horrible US version), and I fell in love. The animation is great and the dialogue is original. CLAMP's characters are easy to fall in love with (especially Kero-chan!), and the storyline is too. And, of course, CCS has all the love-triangles you'd expect from CLAMP. I find myself watching this tape over and over again. This series, unlike many, makes you want to watch more episodes, new or old to you.
Oh, and if you enjoy quality entertainment, DO NOT get the American version. I turned it on today, and the episode ""Sakura's Heart-Racing First Date"" was on (not the English title, obviously), and after watching the uncut, I was horrified. The English company put in scenes FROM OTHER EPISODES. It made absolutely no sense at all. Kero-chan isn't helping Sakura out, Sakura reads the cards like the Tarot to find out which three would be her best bet in capturing The Watery (yet she really only has three), Sakura doesn't have a date with Yuki to go to the aquarium, yet she just meets him out front and they go get ice cream. Oh, and when they're in the restraunt and telling Touya-san what they want, ""Julian"" says they'll have two chocolate sundaes and two lemonaids, not that he'll have a strawberry-milk snow cone. Touya asks him if he wants the extra-large, not if Sakura would be able to eat the rest......

As she went on-line to learn more about the series, she saw that there were some edits and was dying to see the real series.  As I sat down to watch with her, I became a little intrigued as well.
Sakura is a cute series without going overboard.  I expected something along the lines of ""Sailor Moon"" and was pleasantly surprised to find a good storyline, with refreshing and funny characters.  The only part that was a little frustrating was the art itself, being a little on the basic side compared to some of the other series that I've seen.  Other than that, this is a great series, and is a must for any child who enjoys Cardcaptor.

1357653,4,B00004UTXE,"I had seen an episode of this series while I was in Japan but, not speaking the language, I didn't have any idea of its name, or even what was really going on.  When my twelve year old brought this DVD home from the mall, the two of us sat down to watch.  What a hoot!
Sakura unwittingly unleashes powerful and magical cards when she breaks the seal on a book she discovers in her basement.  She also awakens Kero, who fell asleep on the job of guarding the Clow Cards, and who makes Sakura into a Cardcaptor to save the world from their destructive powers.  Kero, who calls himself a guardian beast, is anything but beastly; he's cute, small, and often described (as an insult) as a plush toy.  He is as hapless as 10 year old Sakura.
The funniest part of this (for me) is the costumes Sakura's friend insists on designing for the captor battles - and the fashion commentary Kero provides at the end of each episode.  But the  humor does not end there.  My daughter and I laughed throughout these episodes at the small moments of comedy interpersed with battles reminiscent of both Sailor Moon and (to a lesser degree) Pokemon.
In my opinion, the humor sets this series apart from others imported from Japan.  Although I can't comment on the translation of the subtitles, I was a little put off by the Americanisms at first.  The decision must have been made to make Sakura sound like a school girl in any language.  As always, I much preferred the subtitled track to the English language.
I recommend this series for all ages.  Young children will love cute Kero while older children, especially girls who like Sailor Moon, will appreciate the concerns of Sakura.  As for adults, indulge!",979862400,2,1690,4.556291390728477

I think the translation is a little off as I've seen all 70 episodes.  There are only slight differences but it's overall nicely done.  The DVD acutally keeps the episodes in order, ex. the dubbed version showed the Firey card too soon as it was supposed to be the last episode of season 1 (3 seasons in total).  Hopefully in the DVD's they'll show how Li starts falling for Sakura, the rebirth of Clow Reed, Kero's real form, Guardian of the Moon Yui, etc without any altering like the WB.

I got this tape and I was VERY, VERY happy! The theme song is catchy, the voices are cute, there's a complex web of love which the dubbers didn't seem to like. (especially Tomoyo's very GREAT fondness for Sakura... ;) --I probably spelt her name wrong, sorry.. >_<) At first, I thought CCS was a copy of Sailor Moon before I got this tape, but I was dead wrong.

1357658,5,B00004UTXE,"Now here comes the REAL Card Captor Sakura.  (Card Captors on WB is NOT the same series.  And what I mean by that is lots of content was cut in the U.S. version.  They also started on on Japanese episode 8, which was not a good idea.  Good job Nelvana!  Thanks for butchering it and making it ""kid-friendly""!)  These are the ORIGINAL Japanese episodes.  Also regular opening and ending, with the nice little ""Leave it to Kero"" sketch, in which Kero describes the costume Sakura is wearing in that episode prior to it.  The DVD contains few extras, but the four episodes in it make up for the extra shortcomings.  If you want to know what the extras, buy the DVD!  Find out for yourself.  But once you buy it, anime fans and especially CCS fans shouldn't be disappointed.  Briefly, for the uneducated, here's how the series starts out.  Here we have a normal 10-year-old schoolgirl (aren't they all) who stumbles upon the Clow Book in her father's basement ""library"".  She's innocently opens the book and takes out one of the cards, which was the Windy.  She accidently activated it's powers and blew all the cards away, not realizing the damage she has done.  Here, she meets Kerberos or ""Kero-chan"", who looks like a talking stuff animal.  He's the supposed guardian beast of the seal.  When he realizes the cards are gone, he then concludes that Sakura must recapture the cards and end the coming destruction.  Well, is that good enough?  Good.  The animation is excellent and is done by am all-female group in CLAMP.  The animation is done by Madhouse.  But most importantly, they have the original personalities.  (I can't believe Nelvana and WB changed some of the personalities, especially Tomoyo! (Madison).  You'll see what I'm talking about.  So anyway, happy viewing!",977616000,14,1777,4.782178217821782

It falls into the Mahou Shoujo (Magical Girl) series that Sailor Moon Minky Momo (The Magical Princess Gigi in the USA), and Magical Knight Rayearth do.  It's very pink, has top of the line animation (it's from CLAMP, of course it's great!) and is just overall adorable.  It's one of the few Mahou Shoujo series that revolve around younger girls (girls up to about 10-12 years old) that really held my intrest.  Some of them are just too child-like to intrest me for a very long period of time (I'm a girl, and I do watch a lot of kid's stuff, but I do have my limits).  The good points for me were - NO BLOOD, NO EROTIC STUFF, and NO BIG ROBOTS!  I hate big robots.  But I did give it a four, since after owning Japanese volumes up to volume #4, I honestly don't feel the desire to buy any more.

Later on, Li (which is his last name, not his first!) and Meling are introduced.  This also doesn't cut out the complex web of crushes that the dub does.

I saw the kids WB version and my stomach turned with digust. They got rid of the quirky little jappannese customs, that add character to the tv show in addition to adding voices that are best reffered to as an atrocity that has only been excelled by the dub of sailormoon.

1357667,5,B00004UTXE,"I must say that nothing beats the real thing when it comes to anime. If you've been watching horrifically edited and altered version of Card Captor Sakura that's broadcasted in the U.S. (even the title's edited to Cardcaptors), or if you're just looking for that next anime title to fill you're growing collection, the UN-altered, UN-edited, UN-Americanized version is something that you shouldn't pass up.
With this DVD American audiences and anime fans finally get to see the real program that so many in Japan fell in love with. All the humor and lightheartedness that the edited-Cardcaptors took out is back, including the small end segment ""Leave It To Kero-chan!"" And of course, Sakura's usual task of helping Kero-chan retrieve all of the missing Clow Cards is there for your enjoyment. The only real problem with this DVD is that it includes the, well I'll be kind, crappy Cardcaptors intro and song. But not to worry, it's safely stowed away in the EXTRAS section of the DVD, so if you want to watch the original intro, you'll see it everytime you start a new episode.
Why do I say that people watching Cardcaptors in the U.S. should get this DVD instead of the dubbed version (that's right! Only the subtitled version with the Japanese track is on this DVD! *smile*)? Because with the dubbed version you don't see the original work, the one that was so popular in Japan. What you see instead is a heavily edited and Americanized version that basically tries to take every element of Japanese society out of it. While this reigns true for nearly every dubbed anime title out there, Cardcaptors is by far one of the most prominent examples of this.
And why should you die-hard anime fans get it? Well, it's just a really good series that, while yes it is designed for kids, can appeal to nearly everyone if they just sit down and watch it.
By just watching the first four episodes contained on this DVD one can see just why this series was so successful in Japan and how enjoyable it actually is. And if you're already a fan of Cardcaptors? Hey, nothing beats the REAL thing.",975801600,48,2083,4.678474114441417

1357669,5,B00004UTXE,"The Cardcaptor Sakura series (it will soon be unnecessary to explain) is one of the finest children's stories in any artistic medium.  An artistic achievement on the level of other great stories such as the Harry Potter novels, it approaches the quality of Lewis Carroll's Alice books, which they strongly resemble. It combines a keen understanding of child psychology, a dense plot that operates (like Alice) on both literal and symbolic levels, beautiful animation, and a lively sense of humor.
Young children will identify with the plucky main character, Sakura, and be enchanted by the irrepressible Kero-chan, the flying teddy bear who guides her through the magical world to which she is drawn.  They may need some time to get used to a Japanese-language version with subtitling, but the vitality of the voice acting and the luminous music make it far superior to the frequently incoherent dubbed version shown on the WB Network.
Those 14 and up (including parents) will find Cardcaptor Sakura by turns amusing, entertaining, compelling, and at times even frightening.  Sakura's magical adventures are played out against a realistic background of a single-parent family situation.  It frequently references real fears, and there is a dark undercurrent to many of the episodes (like many in Alice in Wonderland) that makes them gripping even for a 50-something viewer.
Pioneer is also to be commended for providing an economical four episodes per tape.  This is important, as most viewers who buy this first volume will certainly want those that follow.",973036800,8,1558,5.216

(Brian Drummond always rocks! Although I like  the new Vegeta better. ^^)
Rather pointless name changes run rampant.  Probably the two main examples would be Li Shaoran, (Which I have also seen  spelled Syaoran) which I believe was changed to Lee Showran, or some  similar mockery. And Rika, who was changed to Rita. Come on.
They  started at episode eight and bounced around from there. Enough said.

Of course I  love both comic and video versions, I prefer video better, since the plot  is well reorganized and scenes are vividly beautiful.
For example,  forseeing dreams of final contest appears many times. Even before Sakura  meets Cerberus, she met him in the forseeing dream.
Plots are slightly  different between comics and video versions. In Video version, it has new  character, Mei Ling, Lee's ""fiance"" from Hong Kong, who adds  extra entertainment to the plots.
CLAMP is a Japanese manga artist group  (consists of four lady artists) well known by their work, ""Magic  Knight Rayearth.""
One thing it differs from Sailor Moon is that  Sakura always tries to solve the situations by herself. Sakura's  never-give-up and do-my-best spirits always affect those friends who  support her.
This is the story of growth of a girl, and the main theme  is love and sympathy. Some episodes made me deeply think about love and  friendship deeply.

1357674,5,B00004UTXE,"Cardcaptor Sakura is a great show and manga. I own Mixx vol. 1 of the manga and watch the dub on tv. The dub is very disappointing. There's all this  episode skipping just so Li can be the main character. And in all the  commercials his name is mentioned first. I will definitely be buying this  movie(if my allowance can ever recover from my sister's present and  pre-ordering Pokemon silver!). This story has a great plot and is fun for  kids and teens alike. It is about a girl named Sakura who opens a book of  magical cards with incredible powers(These are nothing like Tarot cards.  This show is very kid friendly.)All the cards escape from the book, the  Clow. A cute animal comes out of the cover. His name is Kero and he tells  Sakura that she has to find the Clow Cards and save the world. So Sakura is  appointed Cardcaptor and with Li, Meilin, and Madison(Tomoyo in the manga  and Jap. version)to find the cards. I totally recommend this movie to any  one who likes Magic Knight Rayearth and Sailor Moon.",966211200,7,1016,4.461956521739131

This story is excellent, and I highly suggest  it for those who enjoy shojo (girl's) anime.  I also suggest that those who  have only seen the dub view it as well.  Save yourselves.  If you don't  know much about typical anime, however, be prepared for a few surprises.",965779200,3,443,4.6103896103896105

7924075,5,B00004UTXE,"Sailor Moon may have been the first real 'magical girl' anime but Sakura showed her how it's done! This series is funny, exciting and dramatic. It makes you think (as all CLAMP productions do). Great fun for everyone but most perfect for 3rd-6th grade girls.

I've loved Cardcaptor Sakura since I first watched it in grade school. I'm collecting the whole series, now, in hopes that my kids will love it, too. Even better, while I buy them I'm getting to enjoy re-watching them on my own and with my grade school cousins. It's new and nostalgic all at once!",1405900800,,557,4.57
7924076,5,B00004UTXE,"The grand original! Sweet and compelling, this is the saga of a little girl who finds herself enmeshed in a magical world of cards! Magical cards which have escaped their bonds, and now flash about in many different guises, wreaking havoc. Young Sakura must re-capture the entire deck, using the powers of the cards she already has: with a little help from her magical sidekick, Kero-chan. His name is a bit of a joke; it's really Cerberus (""Keroberos""), but Sakura calls him by an affectionate diminuative construction of it.

The Americanized version,released as ""Cardcaptors,"" was heavily edited and even had dialogue re-written to make it more of a boy/girl show instead of primarily a ""Magical Girl"" series, even ""dumbed it down"" a bit in some ways. Appropriate for any age, the stories are easy to follow but tense and dramatic. Parents, you can enjoy watching them with the kids! In fact, I'd already been an anime fan when my kids got me into this! The stories and characters really drive this series, and put it several cuts above the average ""monster of the week"" anime in the Pokemon model.

The only thing I could list as a possible downside are the obligatory ""transformation"" scenes which turn little Sakura-chan into Cardcaptor Sakura. You do get them every episode, occasionally twice, if I recall. But this is standard for the genre and I think an ""anchor point,"" especially for the younger viewers. I don't mind it, but other older viewers might find it tedious, especially if you are watching a few eps at a time, and not just once a week, as originally intended.

Just a cautionary word -- Japanese culture has its own set of mores and taboos, as does the Western world. Sometimes the characters seem to express affection for each other in a way that Western ears might find suggestive. Remember, the main cast are only ten years old! For example, Sakura's friend Tomoyo who videotapes her adventures seems to have quite a crush on Sakura, although Sakura herself seems rather puzzled by this,and Sioran Li, Sakura's classmate and rival Cardcaptor, seems to have a crush on the same teenage boy Sakura does! Not too much should be inferred though, as this in part reflects another convention of anime, showing that a character (the older boy) who seems to be secondary is actually much more important than he seems at first. There is no suggestive activity at all, just the occasional expressions of fondness. This is further complicated by the fact the Japanese word ""suki"" (pr. ""skee"") can be translated as either ""like"" or ""love,"" depending on the context or even on the translator. In any case, I doubt it anything startling enough that a younger viewer would even pick up on it, but if it is a concern, watch through the eps first and decide what bits (if any) you need to FF through! I'll say this, I AM a particular parent regarding this kind of thing, and I have NO problem with this series. It never even occured to me until I saw remarks about it elsewhere, and I was like, ""Surely you can't be serious!""

But bottom line -- this is a terrific series, full of heart, one of anime's real landmarks. It's a cliche`, but this really IS a ""must-see.""",1369180800,,3176,4.717117117117117
