6680440,5,B00NUTFLXE,"This is a nice documentary with beautiful footage of many authentically reproduced airplanes from both sides of the first world war.  If you want intricate detail about the first air war, it might be best to rely on books, but this is a very visually appealing and interesting program that maximizes the video format both in the air and on the ground, including some fun experiments in the air to get an authentic feel for what the aviators experienced.  It's great to see that there are passionate people, these ones being in New Zealand, who have taken such care and invested so much in reproducing these important historic aircraft.",1435795200,2,635,4.81651376146789
6680441,5,B00NUTFLXE,"Nova does its usual good job of exploring war from a technical point of view.  This episode follows the work of a New Zealand outfit that has been rebuilding World War I airplanes and flying them to see how they really worked.  They used the original plans, as best they could, though some information was not available to them.  They did this, not only to reproduce the aircraft as closely as possible, but also for safety reasons.  As one of them explains, when you try to make something better sometimes you find out the hard way that it changed the performance in ways that you really don't want.  They trusted the original designers and builders to know what they were doing.

They rebuilt a number of WWI craft, not all certainly, but a number from throughout the war, so we can see how quickly and profoundly they changed.  The first were underpowered, neither fast nor very good airplanes.  By war's end they were able to fly faster, carried bombs, cameras, machine guns and had invented many of the techniques still used to today in aerial warfare.

They flew them in simulated combat to see how well they performed and there is some very nice footage of them in the air.

Overall I thought it was a very good episode, about as much as you can expect from 50 minutes' or so worth and intended for a rather general, if technically inclined audience.  If you want a lower price, I would suggest buying it in Amazon Instant.",1430611200,4,1430,4.546875

6680443,3,B00NUTFLXE,"I admit to being disappointed by this DVD. I was expecting so much more than what was here. But, what was here was fairly good. So...good and bad.

This is really the story of Vintage Aviator, a New Zealand based group that restores and manufactures vintage WWI aircraft. It has less to do with the ""first air war"" than their efforts to experiment with a few types of British and German aircraft. They give a very brief thumbnail sketch of the air war in WWI and how air technology advanced by leaps and bounds in a few short years.

I think they do a good job of looking at how difficult it was for the early pilots to shoot each other down. On the other hand, that wasn't really in doubt or important. I mean, I think anyone would know that it would be difficult for pilots to fire pistols and rifles with any hope of hitting anything - a waste of time and testing effort. Better was their exposition of interruptor gears and the ""Fokker Scourge"".

They do a good job of looking at a very few aircraft: Fokker Eindekker, pusher configurations, Albatross, SE5A but that's it. It's very British-oriented with no mention of excellent French aircraft such as the Nieuport and SPAD. No mention of the Fokker Triplane either.

Good and bad. They did some things well, others not so well. Three stars and not worth the asking price.",1427673600,12,1327,4.4937759336099585

6680445,2,B00NUTFLXE,"A nice little documentary of reconstructed aircraft in New Zeeland. That's all there is. So I think the title is misleading and it's a short documentary. Given the title, the length of the documentary, and the price I can't recommend it much. There are several WWI documentaries that actually give more information on the historical subject than this Nova program. Even given the limited scope of the material, there are quite a few aircraft that have been rebuild that there isn't any information on at all.",1422921600,7,508,4.9186046511627906

6680448,3,B00NUTFLXE,"Excellent cinematography!  The beautiful footage of the WWI aicraft recreations is almost worth the cost of the DVD.  It would be an excellent $9.95 or $14.95 value... however the $24.95 price of admission that I paid was way to high in my opinion!  As I write this I see that the price has already been lowered to $16.79.  For the enthusiast that would probably make it ""worth your while"".  I watched it once... that will probably be the only viewing of this DVD for me.",1420416000,5,471,4.4941176470588236
6680449,4,B00NUTFLXE,"NICE PERSPECTIVES FROM MODERN REPRODUCTION AND REENACTMENT OF WWI AIR COMBAT TEQNIQUES

With only a 1 hour run time, this show touches lightly on many of the crucial air war advancements in WWI with a little historical footage and great perspective from modern exact replicas of famous war planes.  When I say reenactment, I am referring to air reconnaissance and light air combat techniques in the early stages of WWI.  There are no specific battles recreated on a large scale.  A chunk of the short run time is also expended following a team of New Zealand based air buffs that are manufacturing their own exact replicas and retracing the advancements as they build pieces from scratch.  This is very interesting, but appeals more to those who have an interest in the very basic manufacture or reproduction of mechanical devices.  The strictly historically minded individual will still find a great deal of useful perspective from the show.  Watching identical planes in modern footage trying to attempt maneuver-and-fire with laser rifles to simulate first attempts attacking each other with hand guns and rifles was amusing.

I was interested to see that some of the top brass had absolutely no concept of the usefulness of aircraft until they were actually used (battle of the Somme being an important illustration).  That negative opinion was biased because of the flimsiness of the aircraft before improvements.  However, it's still ironic that army leaders, trained to seek high ground or gain intelligence, couldn't picture how aircraft are a combat multiplier in those areas to say the least.  As I said before, the program is very useful at touching many of the important advancements.  However, it is somewhat unpolished and skeletal in it's coverage.  Perspective is it's strongest point in my opinion.  I suggest a rental or very cheap purchase price.

8680317,5,B00NUTFLXE,"As pointed out in another review, this video shows a New Zealand group, called ""Vintage Aviator"" which, build replicas of WWI military aircraft to the finest detail and then, flies than in simulated air combat and reported first hand, the positives and negatives of each machine, instead of repeating what was stated in some old book.
Contrary to the other review, I see this as very positive because, it is impossible to find 100 years old, lumber and canvas war airplanes in flyable condition to do this performance evaluation.
I applaud the effort and dedication of this group of people, to re-create these historic WWI military aircraft as equal as possible to the original ones. This is a must see for the aviation enthusiast!",1472342400,,731,4.903225806451613

8680322,2,B00NUTFLXE,"As other reviews here have mentioned, this was a biased ""documentary"". It discusses in length how the British finally out-engineered the superior German airplanes, but then they fail to compare the German comeback with the Fokker DVII. They also don't do a good comparison of the French planes. I had to research it online to find out that the DVII turned out to be an even more superior plane than what the British had come up with.
