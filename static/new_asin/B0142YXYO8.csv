8729576,5,B0142YXYO8,"Being a part of country music we absolutely knew about The Louisiana Hayride program and right off the bat, Robert Mugge reminds us why this institution was of such importance to our genre in Rhythm 'n' Bayous: A Road Map to Louisiana Music.

But Mugee doesn't stop there with his exploring of the musical contributions of the state of Louisiana in this travelogue.

He takes us through the state from north to south finding the ways that each region connects to one other through their versions of blues and Gospel, while also exploring the many distinct sounds that make each region different from one another that includes an in-depth look at Zydeco music.

He allows room for plenty of performances to speak for themselves, whether it's from headliners such as Merle Kilgore and Frankie Ford, or the underground artists such as jazz trumpeter Kermit Ruffins and Nathan & The Zydeco Cha Chas .

When this 2-hour trip through the music and culture of Louisiana rolls it's final credits, you will be rushing to your favorite online booking agency to book your trip to Louisiana  to check it all out yourself!",1458691200,,1109,4.815789473684211
8729577,5,B0142YXYO8,"Director Robert Mugge has been making documentaries of Americas roots music since 1993. (A quick look at Internet Movie Database shows that hes made 34 to date  and I think Ive seen most of them at one time or another). This film  produced in 2000, but only now coming to DVD  may be one of his best.  The two-hour film is loaded with music performances that cover every faction of Louisiana roots music.

As you learned right off the bat, Mugge was hired to follow a tour group  run by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (headed at that time by Robert Santelli, bow Executive Director of the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles) to parts of Louisiana. But Muggee got so involved in the non-rock and roll musical culture that he left the tour group go and followed his own trail covering every corner of the state. He found an expert in each place to provide an introduction.

Its been way too many years since I saw, and heard, Frankie Ford (Sea Cruise was his bif 1950s hit, but he performs the B side in this film. And I don't think Ive ever seen Swamp Rock king Rod Bernard (major hit was Can this go on Forever?) perform. Other names youll recognize if you are over 60 are Dale Hawkins, Dale & Grace (Im Leaving it all up to you) and Claude King. In the old-timey genre we see (and hear) the Hackberry Ramblers, who have been playing since 1936 and still has two original members!. There Zydeco and cajun and gospel and Im sure another genre Ive left out. Oh yes, Blues. We see and hear Henry Gray who played piano for Howlin Wolf, Willie Dixon and Muddy Waters!  Theres even a new young Zydeco rap musician/singer.  Its not all old folks either. We hear a terrific 15 year old Cajun fiddle player/singer perform with her brother and parents.

I could go on and on but  trust me on this. If you like Louisiana music of any style and time, you get more than two hours of material (nearly all are full performance) with great camera work and sound!

There are bonuses too  not listed on the package. These are great sounding LIVE audio performances by five of the performers, including Henry Butler and Rosie Ladet plus one audio track by Bill Morrisey (not from Louisiana) that was recorded when Mugge made his documentary on the founding of Rounder Records  also now being re-released on DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
