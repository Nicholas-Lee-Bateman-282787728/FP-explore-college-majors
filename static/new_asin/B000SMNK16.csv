2887863,5,B000SMNK16,"Father Knows Best is being released next month so maybe Marcus Welby will not be far behind. Marcus Welby, MD was truly an excellent show; great characters and story lines. So far, others I've wished for have been released so maybe Marcus is next. I mean don't they have to release it before everyone who knows it leaves the planet?",1204848000,16,332,4.55
2887864,5,B000SMNK16,"I was only a teenager when this show came on, but I liked it and watched it most every week.  Ol' Dr. Marcus gave each and every one of his patients his utmost care and professional attention, and his credentials, ethics and medical knowledge were beyond reproach.  Today, we have all sorts of assorted bozos coming out of medical schools who I wouldn't let care for a pooch I didn't like.  Bring on the DVD's guys!!
And I agree with one other poster that today's TV is unmitigated trash...poor writing, acting, the whole bit...never watch the junk myself.",1203206400,18,556,4.653061224489796
2887865,5,B000SMNK16,"I am saddened to find that you can't buy the seasons of Marcus Welby on DVD yet when so many other shows are available.
This was such a wonderful heartwarming show. Robert Young was ahead of his time with this show.",1199664000,23,215,4.2682926829268295
2887866,5,B000SMNK16,I have been checking Amazon hoping to find Marcus Welby on DVD for a long time now. It was a great show and I am hoping to see it offered in the near future. The shows on TV today are not even worth watching. I think that it is wonderful to purchase the old shows and let my son appreciate how good TV used to be. I don't know what the writers are thinking today most of them have their minds in the gutter and it does not set good examples for the younger generation.,1199318400,69,468,3.9368421052631577
2887867,5,B000SMNK16,I feel that Dr. Welby was before his time. This was cutting edge drama. This was a well thought out show.,1198540800,31,105,4.0476190476190474
2887868,5,B000SMNK16,"Back in the day, medical dramas were primarily soap operas with a focus on people's multitudinous troubles and the occasional rare, but life-threatening ""are-we-gonna-renew-his-contract-next-season-or-not"" disease thrown in for good measure.

Marcus Welby, MD was different. It was the first network program to have more of a true medical focus, and yet it kept a good balance, interweaving the medical theme with the drama of people's storm-tossed lives. I've read that medical professionals thought highly of this show, because of its fairly accurate depiction of a general practitioner's day-to-day life.

And Marcus Welby was such a likable character. And the show's writing was stellar. I still remember so many wonderful quotes from the show and I could probably sit down and recite a dozen of the story lines - just from memory. It made *that* kind of impression.

The show first aired on ABC in 1969 and one year later, actor Robert Young won an Emmy for his portrayal of Dr. Welby. In 1972, he won the Golden Globe Award. Interestingly, another medical drama, ""Medical Center"" (remember that hunky Chad Everett?) also hit the airwaves in 1969.

I came to this site, hoping against hope that Marcus Welby, MD had been put onto DVD but am saddened to see that it hasn't happened yet.

If you think it's time to get Marcus Welby, MD onto DVD, how about a ""yes"" vote for this review and let's show them how many people are paying attention and better yet - ready to pay *money* to see this show again (and again).",1196640000,239,1518,4.868217054263566

2887891,4,B000SMNK16,The writers of the show must have been futurists.  Robert Young still at his best.  A really cool watch.

2887892,5,B000SMNK16,If you are into classic television and Marcus Welby then you will not be disappointed. I have found a DVD containing about half of the first season at the neighborhood dollar store. If you participate in Amazon Prime then you can purchase individual episodes  as well as the season there. The quality of the DVDs are old school but then  when watching a program made 40 plus years ago that old school feel adds to the nostalgia.,1472860800,,428,4.545454545454546

2887921,5,B000SMNK16,"How much fun to see Dr. Welby and that young sprout, Dr. Kiley, putting their medical minds together once again!  So glad this made it to DVD! We were in trouble, even 'way back then, as young medical residents spurned general practice for high-paying specialty medicine. The very first episode points this out.  Dr. Welby to resident Dr. Kiley:  ""Have you ever considered General Practice?""  Dr. Kiley: Sure! And I've also considered having my leg broken in three places and joining the Foreign Legion!""  See, our healthcare problems were bubbling up even back then!  Dr. Welby looks at patients, not as percentages, or chances of survival, but as people--people for whom he has cared, often, since their birth.  It's amazing that anybody ever thought of medicine that way.  But, once upon a time, doctors visited people in their homes, knew their histories--not through computer screens, but through their actual, lived lives, and built trust and confidence the way that Dr. Welby did.  Sure, he would have had an automatic lawsuit dealing with that aphasic guy in the very first episode, but, golly, times were different back then.  Maybe not.",1426550400,3,1146,5.015873015873016

Her blather about wanting to be ""free"" certainly rings hollow, seeing that as a direct result of her ""freedom"" she is about to face the very real confinement that motherhood provides.

2887942,5,B000SMNK16,"Marcus Welby was a show that we all watched because Robert Young was the star and we had only a few channels and one TV. It was great to remember how it was and good to see how far we have progressed in technology as well as in the manner of how we treat people. (Dr. Welby's treatment of a female overweight patient (sub plot) is rather harsh and his words most unkind . Of course, some would say that the truth hurts.) The plot is obvious and the outcome predictable - the main sympathetic character has a problem and is assisted by the doctors and all is well at the end of the episode. I especially liked that I could buy the one episode and did not have to purchase the whole season. I hope that Amazon would consider this option with other shows (Medical Center).

Unfortunately, my hearing impairment has progressed to the point that I no longer can enjoy these shows without closed captioning.  I have found that many of the rereleases of the old shows do include subtitling of one kind or another, but Amazon's technical description sometimes doesn't indicate that fact.  Does anyone know if Marcus Welby is available with subtitling?  Also, this is a plea to Amazon to please let us know whether any type of subtitling is included on DVDs and if it is not, please say that.  And, to the companies which produce these DVDs, please know that your target audience primarily is made up of older people and many of us have hearing impairments.

In it was David Cassidy before he became famous . . . the alienated child of divorce . . . the beach at Santa Monica . . . it's funny how certain TV episodes, and the images in them, you saw as a kid just stick in your mind.

The series itself is even better than I remember it.  That, of course, is not always the case with shows you watched when you were growing up.  Robert Young is in many ways exceptional; he's not only compassionate, as we all remember him, but also very intelligent in his dislike of stereotypes and simple-minded thinking.  (Unfortunately, that doesn't always apply to women; there is definite sexism in this series!)  Elena Verdugo is the sweet Consuelo I remember.

2887979,5,B000SMNK16,"Before medical dramas like ""ER"", ""Greys Anatomy"", and ""Private Practice"" filled up our TV screens there was ""Marcus Welby, MD"". The series debut on the ABC television network in the fall of 1969 and became an instint hit not just for its remarkable acting, but for its writing of topical issues that other TV shows were afraid to touch on. Mental issues, alcoholism, and even homosexuality (although the writers did a sloppy job in portraying gays) were discussed when the series originally aired. The first season was a huge success with the series finishing at a respectful #8 in the national Nielsen numbers.

 The series starred former film star Robert Young as Marcus Welby and James Brolin as his young partner. Brolin is now known as Mr. Barbra Streisand.

 The final episode on this set entitled ""The Daredevil Gesture"" was directed by a young Steven Speilberg who directed multiple television episodes for Universal during the late sixties, including one on ""Night Gallery"" featuring Joan Crawford

 The first two seasons have seen releases on DVD by Shout! studios, but now consumers can purchase this great individual set with ten episodes from season one.

2887981,5,B000SMNK16,"This was an excellent series and brought back a lot of memories. Considered old-fashioned by today's standards, the practice of medicine was all about doing whatever it took to help people, bottom line.

2887984,5,B000SMNK16,"Brilliantly written and acted, Marcus Welby, M.D. is the 'ultimate' television medical drama.
Long before the trash currently hitting the airwaves, there were 'good' family shows for people to watch.
This show is one of those shows. Guaranteed to stir emotions within you...as well as bring a smile to your face!
Even in the face of tragedy, Dr's Welby and Kiley help people to know their own self-worth and see them through whatever illnesses that may be affecting their lives. I truly wish that I had known my own personal 'Dr. Welby.'
If, in fact, doctors were like the show portrayed at the time...I'm curious what happened! Now you're lucky if your doctor even talks with you for a few minutes.
There have been numerous medical dramas that have shown up on television, but none with the heart and soul of this series!
You are easily lost in this program for 49 mins. Although I wasn't even born yet when this series originally aired...I am enjoying the series ever-so-much now!
This is classic television at it's best! Excellent Series!!!",1280448000,5,1043,4.832402234636872

It takes you back to a time when life was less harried and family values and good morals were still the norm. Dr Welby is so caring and level-headed and Dr Kiley (James Brolin) is quick-to-judge and often arrogant (but oh so nice to look at!). If you want to forget your problems for a while buy this DVD and sit and enjoy.  You'll love it!",1280448000,,457,4.3023255813953485
2887986,5,B000SMNK16,"I remembered Marcus Welby, M.D. from seeing repeats on Cable TV in the mid-1980's, and from seeing ""A Matter of Humanities"" around 1980 as a movie on KHTV-39, an independent TV station, in Houston.  I was impressed on the compassion of this physician who took the time to know his patients so he could better serve them.  Dr. Welby was a simple man, and it's impressive that he made house calls.

I'm glad to see this series released on DVD.  TV Land carried it briefly in 2001. I have watched most of the DVD's, and many episodes I watched more than once.  While there are many actors I recognized (such as Richard Thomas, Julie Adams, Heather Menzies, Susan Clark (wow - she was pretty), Joanna Cameron (she was pretty too - I remember her as Isis),  Don Stroud (with a full head of hair) and Barry Williams), I was more impressed with the story content and the exploration of medical issues.

One of my favorites was the one on the high school boy with hemophilia.  I wasn't aware that the advances in treatment were made less than 40 years ago.  I know a guy who was born with hemophilia and he had to have a liver transplant because a clotting medication was infected and taken off the market.  I also liked the one on leukemia, where advances were being made through research.  I also wasn't aware that the detection of the RH-factor (discussed in one episode with a pregnant woman) was only post-World War II.  Dr. Welby told a story to Dr. Kiley about witnessing a baby's death due to the RH-factor ""complication"" as a young doctor.

While much of the story content can be applied today, I do have to admit that I like seeing the old cars on the streets, like Welby's blue Chrysler New Yorker - an antique land yacht - and the old Cadillac hearse type ambulances.  Rotary phones and electric coffee percolators make for an occasional laugh, and I recall one episode where Dr. Welby has medical records sent to him from out-of-state on what looks like a huge fax machine.  It took up a whole table, and the phone has to be connected by hand to the modem.

I'll have to order Season 2.  Glad to see quality shows like Marcus Welby, M.D. found a home on DVD.  Season 1 must have sold well. In my opinion, Marcus Welby, M.D. was much better than the last medical show NBC made called Trauma. I'm glad Trauma was canceled, particularly because hundreds of EMT's and paramedics sent e-mails to NBC after the first episode aired, saying they didn't appreciate the portrayal of their profession on TV.",1278633600,3,2501,4.52
2887987,4,B000SMNK16,"""Marcus Welby, M.D. - Season One""  stars Robert Young as kind and caring family practitioner Dr. Marcus Welby and James Brolin as his young, motorcycle-riding associate, Dr. Steven Kiley.  The highest-rated medical drama on TV for seven consecutive seasons, ""Marcus Welby"" aired on ABC from 1969 to 1976, paving the way for such popular hits as ""House, M.D.,"" ""Grey's Anatomy,"" and ""Royal Pains.""

Week after week, Dr. Welby encountered devastating disorders but confronted them with honesty and dedicated compassion.  He even made house calls.  The show reversed the common formula, with the older and wiser Welby embracing unorthodox treatments while younger Dr. Kiley had the tried-and-true, straitlaced approach.

The seven-disc set contains 26 episodes including one -- ""The Daredevil Gesture"" -- directed by Steven Spielberg, and the original two-hour pilot movie, ""A Matter of Humanities.  Guest stars include Anne Baxter, David Cassidy, Robert Guillaume, Vera Miles, Butch Patrick, and Richard Thomas.",1278201600,4,1009,5.642384105960265

The three major players (Doctors Welby and Kiley, and Nurse Lopez) are among some of the greatest television characters I have ever seen, and they were played to perfection by Robert Young, James Brolin, and Elena Verdugo respectively. I am glad that Shout! put out this first season's worth, and I am truly looking forward to #2 (the one where the series went into first place in the ratings and held that ranking-- the first ABC series to do so), when and if that next one comes out, and if we're lucky, the series in its entirety. The $40 that I spent in the purchase of this release has most certainly been a well-spent $40, as it was previously with ""Hawaii Five-O,"" another late-'60's classic.

The writing, story development, acting, and superb cast are genuine, not a false note anywhere. Thanks to Shout Factory for a beautiful presentation of Season 1 episodes.

Robert Young, who had a medicore film career, but became known as the dad on ""Father Knows Best"", starred as Dr. Welby, a sensitive, yet intelligent family physician whose job week after week was to help those in crisis. The series also starred Mr. Barbra Streisand himself James Brolin, a hunky, motorcycle driving doctor who worked with Dr. Welby in his practice in Southern California. The series tackled many issues including rape, impotence, veneral disease, depression, and many others, and by the show's second year (1970-1971) the drama hit the top spot in the Nielsen ratings and became the first series on the ABC network to become the #1 show of the season. Both Young and Brolin won Emmys for their work and ""Marcus Welby M.D."" would win the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. The show was not without controversy, however,  as two episodes the series filmed were aimed at basically demoralizing homosexuals. One of these episodes called ""The Outrage"" dealt with a gay teacher sexually assaulting one of his male students. Gay rights groups picketed the ABC studios, and ultimately 17 network affiliates refused to air the program marking the first time such an incident happened on one of the big three U.S. networks.

2888003,5,B000SMNK16,"Words cannot express how happy I am to see that Marcus Welby M.D. Season One is planned for release this coming May. MWMD was one of my favorite TV shows when I was growing up and I hoped that it (like Hawaii Five-O and Mary Tyler Moore Show before it) would eventually be available on DVD. But after years of hoping, I thought the show was simply lost in the noise of the vintage/retro TV landscape probably never to be found. So imagine my surprise when I did a ""drive-by"" search for it today (as I had done for years) and found there was actually an item listing with a release date?!

I was fortunate to have a few episodes of MWMD on video and they served as constant reminders of how good the show was, and how much I wished I could have had Dr. Welby as my primary care physician :-). But what really impressed me was how honestly the show portrayed real life, everyday people with health and human issues. And yes, occasionally kindly Dr. Welby had to be stern and put his foot down (rarely unsuccessfully) when a patient was not doing the right thing, wouldn't take his advice, etc. And sometimes, things didn't end happily, just like in real life. But in today's world of corporate medical practices, manic hospitals, insensitive and/or incompetent doctors, etc, who wouldn't want to visit Dr. Welby, Dr. Kiley, and Nurse Consuelo at their peaceful suburban office-residence, providing their personal and humane medical care? AND they even made house calls!!!

I look forward to this release and hope that Shout! Factory will commit to following up with every season of this wonderful TV series.",1265155200,10,1605,4.647887323943662
2888004,5,B000SMNK16,"It stars Robert Young, one of the best all-time actors. The story lines were sensitive and compassionate. The writing on this show was excellent. The series was broadcast in color. All of these add up to a very great TV show. What more do we need to know, except to say PLEASE RELEASE SEASON ONE now! I'll be the first one to buy it. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!",1254268800,4,350,4.4
2888005,5,B000SMNK16,"With all the trash that's available out there on DVD you would think that they would bring some of the classic TV back! Sure - it may not have the glitz, glam & CGI that's available now - but this was a great show. I have seen a few episodes this week on RTV - at home on vacation and found it totally by accident - and just hearing the theme song after so many years was great! But since I work, unfortunately I can not watch it regularly. Good times. Good memories. Great TV show.",1249603200,7,482,4.03125

2888007,5,B000SMNK16,I can say this that the SHOUT factory is looking into this but I think the hold up is rights issues as to who owns the show...at least thats the story I have. Theres alot more left in 2009 so lets hope!,1238112000,7,202,3.8333333333333335
2888008,5,B000SMNK16,"Marcus Welby, M.D., which ran from '69 - '76, was lauded as a landmark medical drama for its time and garnered multiple Emmys for its well thought out and acted story-lines. Robert Young as ""Dr. Marcus Welby"" effectively portrayed the critical yet sympathetic physician who never hesitated to act in the best interests of his patients, sometimes going above and beyond the call of duty. The supporting roles were admirably portrayed by James Brolin as ""Dr. Steve Kiley"" and Elena Verdugo as ""Consuelo Lopez"". The fine quality of this show set the tone for medical dramas to come. I can think of no more deserving drama to be released to DVD -- all seven seasons, uncut and restored. This classic TV drama deserves its place on the library shelves of discerning viewers.",1206921600,25,769,4.833333333333333
2888009,5,B000SMNK16,"If you liked Robert Young as Jim Anderson in ""Father Knows Best"", then you'll just adore him in this long overdue to DVD As Marcus Welby, the kindly old time doctor whom every family would like to call their own. Imagine, a doctor who actually cares about his patients. Whooda thunk it. Try that today! Anyhoo, why is it not on DVD yet? Come on guys. Lets get the ball rollin' and show the folks what real TV was like. Not like today's stuff, let me tell ya!",1206576000,61,458,4.215909090909091
8206005,1,B000SMNK16,"If I was allowed to,  I would give zero stars. Excitement quickly turned to anger when I saw the Marcus Welby, Season 1 box set.  I was hoping for the best,  but got the worst.  As I looked at the set, it looked like the paper that had the photo of Robert Young along with the title of the DVD  was damaged by water. It said that this is a return, resold as new. It is sad to see. I am not happy, nor will I go through the hassle of returning it.  I will order it,  but through the secondary market.  Mr. Besos should be embarrassed to let something like this happen.  In addition, Disc 7 is scratched beyond use. I immediately went to check out the other volume of the show,  that is ok.",1525737600,,688,3.9926470588235294
