7904614,3,B000006QFB,"Along with Lucille Ball and Betty White, Mary Tyler Moore is one of TV's most famous women! This A&E Biography starts at the begining [of her life] until when this biography was produced. There are many intimate photographs of Mary in her childhood and adolecents, and even emotional stills of her and her late son, Ritchie. There are many interviews with Mary Tyler Moore Show, and Dick van Dyke Show cast mates, along with personal friends. There are many clips from various series. One dissapointment was this should have been 2-Hours to accomidate more footage from various roles! (That's what nocked it down to a 3!) For die hard fans only, otherwise tape it on an A&E re-run!",978393600,,681,4.779661016949152
