865745,4,6304411405,"The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight has very good acting; and although it's funny it's still not quite as funny as I hoped. The gags are, for the most part, good but the acting is better still; we get a rare comic turn from a very young Robert De Niro and other actors including Jerry Orbach are wonderfully convincing in their roles. In addition, the cinematography and the choreography really lack nothing; these two things are done very well. The movie flows along at a good pace, all right; but there are just not enough really big laughs to bat this out of the ballpark and make it a true classic comedy.

When the action starts, we quickly meet several people: there's Mafia boss Baccala (Lionel Stander) with his buddies including ""Water Buffalo"" (Frank Campanella). There's also Kid Sally (Jerry Orbach), who is working on a bicycle race project for Baccala (don't ask) and Kid Sally is on pretty good terms with other members of Baccala's group including Beppo (Herv Villechaize). The bicycle race brings many contestants from Italy; and one of them is the incredibly streetwise Mario (Robert De Niro).

However, all does not go well. The bicycle race is canceled after the wooden indoor track is not completed; and Baccala tells Kid Sally that from now on Kid Sally will only be his chauffeur--and nothing else, no chance for climbing the ladder inside the Mafia world. This certainly does not please Kid Sally's mother Big Momma (Jo Van Fleet, who does this role wonderfully); although his sister Angela (Leigh Taylor-Young) doesn't seem to care.

To make a long story short without spoilers, Mario from Italy strikes up a relationship with Angela; and Kid Sally recruits some of Baccala's men to organize an all-out gang war in Brooklyn where Baccala's offices are located. The scenes between Mario and Angela are funny and sweet at once; and Mario's desire for all things American quickly comes to light. In addition, once the gang war starts there are opportunities for funny moments as things don't always go exactly as planned despite the fact that Kid Sally and his men have a lion to terrorize people!

Look also for good performances by Philip Sterling as District Attorney Goodman; Jack Kehoe as a bartender; Irving Selbst as ""Big Jelly"" and Roy Shuman as the Mayor of New York City. Dorothi Fox has a cameo as a meter maid and Fran Stevens also has a cameo as Baccala's wife.

The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight may not be the funniest film I've ever seen; but it's far from being an absolute dud. I would recommend this for fans of the actors in the movie; and people who like dark comedies might also want to consider this for their collections.",1267228800,4,2673,4.752155172413793
865746,5,6304411405,"loved this movie. I remembered it from the time it first was in theaters but never saw the DVD anywhere. The stereotypes are hysterical. Pay attention to the actress playing the italian grandma, she steals the whole movie.",1222819200,,222,4.868421052631579
865747,2,6304411405,"I've read Jimmy Breslin's book on which this movie was based. The book is at least 10 times better than the movie. The book, which was great, has been so dissected here to make this very bad film. I cannot begin to understand how such a good story could result in such  tripe. Robert DeNiro was very young and naive to agree to be any part of this, and it pains me to watch such a great actor be involved in this .
Here are a few things in particular that make this such a disappointment. First, when you read the book Breslin goes into great detail about what happens in certain parts of the story. You'd think whoever wrote the screenplay would have taken this into account, but neglects to for some kind of convenience, or thinking that whoever sees this won't appreciate it. Second, DeNiro's character in the book decides to stay in New York to pursue an art career. They forego this aspect of his character in the movie, and you wonder why. This gives his character some added dimension in the book, and he encounters some interesting people because of this. Instead Mario (who DeNiro plays) is just made out to be a petty thief. Third, the Kid Sally Palombo character is diluted in the movie. In the book you really get a sense of who this guy is, and his importance in the story, as with some of his cohorts. In the film they're all just a bunch of keystone cop kind of wiseguys.
I don't know if this review will help anyone. If you don't believe me, read the highly entertaining book then watch this, or vice versa. If you read the book first, prepare for disappointment when you see the film. This story offered a lot of potential and was dumbed down to make a film.",1203206400,,1675,4.3514376996805115

865750,4,6304411405,"This flick is getting panned by reviewers who measure it with the yardstick of DeNiro's other work and Orbach's later greatness as Lennie Briscoe in ""Law & Order"", but if the truth be known, it's a precursor of ""Johnny Dangerously"". Orbach plays Kid Sally Palumbo, a ""young Turk"" of the Mob, resentful of his boss Baccala (Lionel Stander), who has the cliche ""moustache Pete"" old-line contempt for Kid Sally's small faction. Urged on by his grandmother Big Mama (Jo Van Fleet), he follows her advice not to take anything from anybody. When the Palumbo faction is finally rounded up by the cops, she has a lot to say to news cameras after Kid Sally just flips them the bird. Her first two bits of invective make broadcast as they watch themselves on the news, but then censors start to bleep her out. At that point, she leaps to her feet and shakes her fist at the screen, denying that she'd ever said ""beep"". The later work ""Johnny Dangerously"" was dismissed as ""puerile"" by reviewers and so it was. So's this one, but there's a certain entertainment value to ""dopey fun"", as you see every night of the week on TV's ""reality shows"". But they don't get slammed very much. I wonder why.",1164585600,6,1184,4.589622641509434
865751,3,6304411405,"Another one of De Niro's early film performances being released on DVD, following last year's release of The Wedding Party (De Niro's first film made in 1963 but only released in 1969) and Hi, Mom! (1970, the sequel to Greetings, 1968).  As in the case of these three De Palma-directed films, The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight featured De Niro in a comedic performance, shortly before he would become better known, later in the decade, for brilliant dramatic performances in landmark films such as Mean Streets (1973), The Godfather Part II (1974) and Taxi Driver (1976).  This is probably also the first time that De Niro appears in a gangster film and his first performance as a priest at the beginning of a career in which he would regularly feature as either a doomed gangster (Mean Streets, Godfather II, Untouchables 1987, Goodfellas 1990, Casino 1995) or a compromised priest (True Confessions 1981, The Mission 1986, Sleepers 1997), mostly wrestling with his demons or struggling in a bleak environment of moral ambiguity. Here we see De Niro at the beginning of his career in a spoof about gangsters - three decades before De Niro himself spoofed his gangster persona in Analyse This (1999), Analyse That (2002) and Shark Tale (2004, the latter film collaborating with his old mentor Martin Scorsese, who directed eight top-notch De Niro performances from Mean Streets through to Casino).

De Niro's mock, money-seeking priest has traces both of his equally deceptive character Jon Rubin in the earlier Greetings and Hi, Mom! and his irresponsible, clownish, debt-ridden, small-time gangster Johnny Boy in the later Mean Streets.  However cliche'd this may sound, De Niro's sweet performance, two years before he would make his major breakthrough with Johnny Boy, and his relationship with the one gangster's sister is one of the few moments in the film not undermined by the film's propensity for exaggerated Italian accents and mafia caricatures, instead showcasing De Niro's ability to make the most of a very modest role and (in contrast to his later performances in blockbuster comedies and the likes of Rocky and Bullwinkle 2000) put in a remarkably subtle and believable performance.",1157414400,4,2203,5.128133704735376
865752,3,6304411405,"This hood comedy is a decidedly mixed affair.  Most of the film's broad humor is hit or miss, usually miss.  There are some moments of inspired comedy here to make it worth your while.  What distinguishes the film is a young Robert DeNiro's inspired turn as an Italian thief.  DeNiro's work here towers over anything else in the film.  His performance here seems to inform his later role as Johnny Boy in Martin Scorsese's classic, ""Mean Streets'.",1153699200,4,447,4.753246753246753

The movie version, now on DVD, follows the book closely.  One of the movie's selling points now is the early look at the work of a very young Robert Di Nero, who had just been turned down for a role in the origional [b]THE GODFATHER.  It's full of raunchy humor, ethnic digs aimed at laughs, and it achieves that goal.
