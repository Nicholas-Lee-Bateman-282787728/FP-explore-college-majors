8160902,5,B000LC4620,soo... I believe there was rape but I don't think either person knew so would it be considered rape??? In my opinion no...,1435017600,,122,4.3478260869565215
8160903,5,B000LC4620,"Billy Corbin always puts out a great product , and he did not disappoint. I remember hearing about this story, so it's good that he got it out there.",1342224000,,149,4.172413793103448
8160904,4,B000LC4620,"Wow really shocking. I don't think the rape is as ambiguous as the rapists err alleged rapists claim it to be. The victim is clearly very drugged and drunk throughout the whole ""consensual"" encounter. At various points in the video, she is clearly forced to go through with the sex act. Not too mention that are several instances in the video where there is definitely some premeditation before the attack.

She does engage in sexual acts, but they all across forced in some way, and she is clearly not in her right mind doing it.

At one point one of the frat boys even gets on top of her when she is struggling and wants to get away(Tony Marzullo is one of the creeps name and is the one that fills up the bulk of the movie from the university's side as the rapist in question Mike Yarhaus is too cowardly to be interviewed)

Then there's an obvious coverup attempt by the police who never bother to secure the tapes showing the alleged rape tapes for more than a month (we learn in the last minutes of the documentary that the University of Florida's police department under orders from the State Department orders the victim's case file to be destroyed along with the rape kit, and two dozen polaroids of her injuries, and oh yeah the investigators with ties to the case have been ordered to keep quiet on any inquiries about it).

Then there's scummy politician Rod Smith who never seems to care about the case and immediately just wants the case to go away (he is shown approached by the filmmaker many times but runs away like a coward).

Not too mention that early on with the ""investigation"" we hear about the Chief Assistant State Attorney offer immunity to the frat boys (something he later recants on).

I think what the documentary shows is that you are a naive woman who comes off as promiscuous and has a shady past (it didn't help that the victim was an ex prostitute, and was a stripper) then you are easy prey for guys out that will take advantage of all that to get away with something that wouldn't be as easy to do with another person. I really doubt if Lisa had a different background that any of these lowlifes would come at her after the attack with as much gusto as they did.

None of the frat boys ever come very authentic or honest. Their attorney as well comes as very dishonest and vile. The victim or alleged victim Lisa King is the only one that legitimately comes off very believable.

In the end, it's a good documentary. You definitely understand why rape victims do not feel like coming forward with their stories when some of them are demeaned and dragged through the mud while their attackers walk away free.",1314316800,3,2645,4.484407484407485
8160905,5,B000LC4620,"I can see why there is much disagreement over the events depicted. This really demonstrates the ambiguity of rape cases. On the one hand, the frat boys cheerfully, and repeatedly say that it's rape while we can see their buddy in the background on top of her, forcing her arms to the floor, but then she appears to be so drunk she never explicitly tells him to stop. She also makes no attempt to leave that we ever see. We do see her almost constantly struggling, trying to keep her knees together and pushing away his hands. Next she's egging him on. He also does seem to be choking her into submission at one point, but it's off camera and it's hard to be sure. As long as we're taking a vote, I say yeah, rape. It seems impossible to prosecute though. There is just too much ambiguity. Nobody really comes off looking well in this video, particularly the cops who seem mean and incompetent.",1282608000,2,893,4.418181818181818
8160906,5,B000LC4620,"I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Billy Corben & Co's documentaries. I believe all documentaries should be produced and directed how they do it. You never get bored watching one of their films. The documentary shows both sides of the story equally. The individuals involved are interviewed and share their stories and the actual video depicting the alleged rape is shown as well. You are left to decide for yourself who is guilty, if anyone. Beyond that, it brings to light the difficulty of defining the word rape and shows that even if there is real evidence (like a video) it doesn't always mean that it is an open and shut case because perception of the victims actions differs from person to person.",1231804800,9,716,4.6015625
8160907,4,B000LC4620,"Ok so you have to make your mind up when watching this if she was raped or not...NO IT WAS NOT.....watch this documentary with an open mind, as i did. i did not judge this untill the end...then i came up with ""no it as not rape"" that girl could have left at any time, and never made an attempt to do so...make you own mind up but do watch this..very interesting.

no it was not rape.
she got scared and cried rape...i would say she regrets that now.",1225756800,10,449,4.044943820224719
8160908,5,B000LC4620,"This is a carefully constructed account of a contested event which some people see as rape and some people do not. What is interesting is that there are two videos showing the event and yet still, opposed interpretations are possible. It shows how foolish is the idea that if we could only see something then we would know what really happened. We would, but our ideas of what really happened would not be the same as anyone else's. By the way, I think it was rape.",1175299200,13,465,4.4186046511627906
