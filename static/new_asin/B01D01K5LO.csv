8754465,4,B01D01K5LO,A good story that uses stop-motion animation just not to the clarity of its predecessor movies and others that followed. Still very enjoyable for those who like the genre. The product as delivered from Amazon was delivered safely and as described.,1533600000,,247,5.048780487804878
8754466,4,B01D01K5LO,"A great movie for children with an engaging story line for adults as well. The special effects are outstanding for their time and if the special effects for some of the fantasy beasts were better, I would have given this movie 5-stars instead of 4.  Probably one of the first movie made in which contact lenses were used to change the appearance of the actors eyes which makes them more believable as fantasy creatures.
I highly recommend this movie and will purchase it again as a gift for others.",1526860800,,498,4.595505617977528
