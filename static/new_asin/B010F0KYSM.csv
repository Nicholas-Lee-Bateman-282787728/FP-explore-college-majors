7310571,5,B010F0KYSM,"The film of Alfred Uhrys Pulitzer-Award-Winning play Driving Miss Daisy is an American classic and both Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman were iconic in their roles. In 2010 a production was mounted on Broadway with Angela Lansbury and James Earl Jones in the leads as an older woman in Atlanta in the late 1940s who was told she can no longer drive and the African American who is engaged by the womans son to, well, drive her. It got great reviews. Lucky for us the show  with this cast  traveled to Melbourne, Australia where it was filmed (well, tape recorded) at the Comedy Theatre. PBS aired the 85 minute performance in the US in July and it is now available on DVD. (Actually it will be released on September 29th but I was provided with an advance screener for an objective review. ).

The two lead actors are wonderful, as is the third  Four-time Tony Award winner Boyd Gaines  as Miss Daisys son. The play begins in 1948 when both Miss Daisy and Hoke (Mr. Jones character) are both 71 years old. Over the next 85-minutes the time frame extends nearly 20 years to 1963 and parallels the racial tension and civil rights issues of that period. (By the way, Miss Daisy is a fairly wealthy Jew, which adds to the theme of racial and ethnic prejudice.)

The stage setting is much different than the film and a sparse (and often too-darkly lighted set) are no real replacement for the openness of the original film version. When the camera focuses on the actors its fine, but the long shots can sometimes be confusing.

I am really glad I saw this production on DVD  the acting is superb  but I found myself having an issue with the aging of the characters. At the beginning Ms, Lansbury ( 84 at the time of this recording) looks much older than 71 years old, as the play progresses, she doesnt look like she aged to nearly 90. Mr. Jones (1 year Ms. Lansburys junior) also seems older than 71 at the beginning but does age better  based on his body movement. Had the years not been projected on a screen throughout the play, I would not have known that time had passed that much. Ill give credit to the fact that  in a film  makeup can be applied to age a character which is not possible in a stage production. But I guess thats why  despite the great acting here  Ill always prefer the film version. Again, its just my take on this.

If you want to see class acting, and you missed the TV broadcast, I highly recommend seeing this version. Its a shame that most  if not all  Broadway plays are not recorded with their original award-winning casts  before they close so that those unable to visit New York, as well as future generations, can experience these classic productions. In this case we have the Australians to thank.

The DVD contains no bonus features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7310572,5,B010F0KYSM,"After seeing the first film of this play years ago, which we felt was superb, my wife and I thought we would not enjoy this version because it could not be as good and because we remembered the original, and because this was a stage performance. We decided to give it a try. We were very surprised to enjoy it immensely. The acting of all three actors is very good, as is the filming of the stage, the movements on the stage, and the story itself. In a somewhat subtle manner, it explores family and racial relationships and stereotypes.",1438560000,7,537,4.434343434343434
7310573,2,B010F0KYSM,"I rented this instead of bought it, and was glad I did. It was not something I would find myself watching again...once was enough.

James Earl Jones on stage lacks the depth and warmth he portrays in movies. The subtle nuances into a character cannot be revealed in a stage production. I felt his rendition of Hoke to be brash and stiff and distant, thus making the ending scene not nearly as touching or important as it was portrayed in the film.

Angela was good, but again it just lacked something that I easily found in the film version.

Boyd Gaines was the best part...he was more natural and flowing with the character whereas James seemed like a yelling General devoid of emotion...

I enjoy all these actors in many films and TV shows, but honestly prefer the film much more and watch it several times a year.

I gave it 2 stars because, like the movie with Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy, this show used a lot of the Lord's name in vain dialogue which I do not find funny nor do I find it necessary. The English language has plenty more options than just blaspheming God.

Thank you.",1490832000,,1095,4.45

7310579,4,B010F0KYSM,"This is a fantastic production of a fantastic play.  I won't bother with a synopsis as there are tons of those available.  I was familiar with the film version, starring Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy, and had never seen this performed on stage.  After having seen this stage version, I have an even greater appreciation for the well written script and the acting chops of Jones, Lansbury, Freeman, and the late Ms. Tandy.  The most noticeable distinction between the two is that the stage production has only three actors:  Ms. Daisy, Hoke, and Boolie (who doubles as a few other minor roles).  Angela Lansbury and James Earl Jones, both living treasures and true masters of their craft well into their 80s, are still quick, sharp, funny, and thorough in their interpretations.  Mr. Gaines surely holds his own with these titans. Because of the pacing & staging, there are definitely a few laugh lines here that were missed in the 1989 film.  We still adore Idella and grimace at Florine even though they are never visible. The only reason that I give this production 4 stars instead of 5 is that I am a stickler for accents.  All three actors use a noticeably different southern accent. God bless Ms. Lansbury, but she relies heavily on the similarities between the ""American southern accent"" and the general British accent. At times Miss Daisy sounds as though she spent her first 50 years of life in the UK.  One final kudos for this production is that it was filmed by someone who obviously loves live theatre.  It doesn't mute sounds from the audience or linger too long on close-ups, which allows the viewer to feel as though they are actually enjoying an evening of theatre.  I wouldn't throw out my copy of the 1989 film in exchange for this, but I have certainly put this on the shelf right beside it.",1470096000,5,1813,4.684542586750789

7310590,5,B010F0KYSM,"I saw James Earl Jones in this play on the London stage, and was so excited at the thought of seeing the great Angela Lansbury's performance opposite him.  I was not disappointed.  This is a glorious production, with Boyd Gaines completing an exemplary cast.",1447632000,,258,4.840909090909091
7310591,5,B010F0KYSM,"My wife and I are fans of Angela Lansbury. James Earl Jones always, always offers up a stellar performance. Thus it was mandatory that we give this stage presentation of Driving Miss Daisy a try; and we were pleasantly surprised at the delightful performances of all three stars. Boyd Gaines plays the Miss Daisys son who hires the black chauffeur needed when him mother begins to have auto mishaps. It is a story of years that pass with Hoke (Jones) at the wheel but Daisy (Lansbury) back seat driving. Even if you have seen the cinema film version of this timeless story, it is definitely recommended viewing. It was to us more than a reminder of a great story and mixed racial and religious relationship, an aging process, and historical events touching life, but this stage presentation is a crowning achievement of 3 great actors.

So entertaining that after the 90 minutes are over, we went looking on the shelves for the other version. No finding it easily, we opted for an immediate second viewing of this stage presentation. It is that wells done.",1447286400,4,1056,4.739130434782608

8722287,3,B010F0KYSM,"Just a quick warning, I am writing this as I would a regular movie. Filming a play is fraught with many problems such as theatrical makeup versus movie make up, all gestures are over done to be seen by those in the back of theater and likewise words and inflections are exaggerated to carry in a theater. Even taking that into consideration, I found the acting to be almost yelling and the movements of the actors around the stage to be very awkward with no notable chemistry between Miss Daisy and Hoke most of the time. It was worth watching but not nearly as good as the earlier movie version. The movie took full advantage of its medium to make a more natural interrelationship and the use of actual outside scenery and so forth. I did not feel that this was any better than the movie in any way.",1527638400,,800,4.375838926174497

8722295,5,B010F0KYSM,"This documents a truly superb performance (recorded in Australia) with the always excellent James Earl Jones. Angela Lansbury reminds us what a truly great actress she is (for those who short-change her on the basis of Murder, she wrote). Boyd Gaines completes the company as the son. If you already have the Jessica Tandy-Morgan Freeman version, don't hesitate to add this one to your collection. They are worthy companions on anyone's DVD shelf.",1494028800,2,447,5.136986301369863
8722296,5,B010F0KYSM,"The stage version starring two legendary performers; Angela Lansbury and James Earl Jones. I say again, this is the stage play, not the (wonderful in its own right) motion picture. But it is brilliant! Lansbury gives the role of Miss Daisy a bit more edge, a little more toughness, and is luminous in the title role. James Earl Jones brings a delightful gravitas to a more street-savvy Hoke. The scenes between the unwilling, Jewish, Southern white matriarch and the aging but enduring black chauffer in the pre-Civil Rights south are simultaneously hilarious and thought-provoking demonstrating without preaching their differing views of events, life, and quite frankly, getting older. It's a performance that is nostalgic, often riotously funny, sometimes tragic, and profoundly moving. Best of all, it gives the two stars the chance to square off like the heavy-weights they are, and go toe-to toe in a delightful and memorable collaboration.",1491177600,2,945,5.306666666666667
