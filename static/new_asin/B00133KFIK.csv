This workout is way above my fitness level - I am in my 50s and quite overweight- but I did about 40% of the workout and really felt it. Something about Angie Miller makes me want to keep working at this until I can do the whole thing. She does have one person in the group working out at a modified level, with no step, and no ""one footed"" balance moves. Even so, it was tough. I think this is a superior workout for someone in the intermediate to advanced range. I am in the beginner to intermediate range, and honestly, I can't wait until I can do this entire workout. The workout itself requires two lighter dumbells and one heavier one; an X-ertube with handles that can hook around your feet, and an optional step. I found that I could use the step for some moves and not for others, so I kept it there and just got off of it when it got to be too much for me.",1230681600,3,1008,4.121827411167513

3101747,5,B00133KFIK,"Wow, this is tough.  It's good tough, but tough none the less.  This is a new instructor to me, and she's very good and pushes you hard.
While it's toining, you're working out so fast that your heart rate will be up there at most times.  That also helps burn more fat which is one of the reasons I really love this workout.  I also love how you go from working one muscle (like your legs in a lunge) and then that move becomes two muscles (the lunge with an arm row) and then that becomes three moves (lunge, arm row and butt kick).  It keeps this interesting and fresh and makes your muscles work.  You practically work every muscle you own and some you didn't know you had.
She's not too over the top but is outgoing and friendly (although does talk a little too much) and all you need are dumbells, x-ertube and a step if you have it.  I really enjoy doing this - it's hard but worth pushing through it.  The results will speak for themselves.  The near 70 minute workout absolutely flies by and you have fun while you're at it.  I highly recommend this.",1214265600,14,1057,4.24

8248959,5,B00133KFIK,"This video is a must for your collection!  I have over 200 workout dvds, but this is my first Angie Miller, and I will be buying more!  This video is a perfect balance of cardio and weight training, and works every muscle in your body.  It is not at all repetitive or boring.  Angie has some excellent moves that I have never seen before.  She also works you hard at a particular exercise, then gives you a tiny break by switching to a move where you can catch your breath, but still keep working out.  Then Angie starts you again on a movement that is more challenging.  For equipment, weights are needed and a stretch band.  In addition, Angie uses a step for several movements, but she has a modifier who does not use one.  If you don't own a step, you will still definitely get a strong workout.  I do have a step and own some step workouts that have such complicated choreography that I doubt that I'm getting a good workout because I have to frequently stop and rewind the dvd.  Angie's use of the step is more athletic.  It would be impossible to get confused, and so the step serves the function that it should, by making your movements more intense - you get more ""bang for the buck"" of your exercising time.  Anyway, you get the idea - this is just one terrific workout.  I found Angie Miller by accident on Amazon, and I'm so glad that I did!",1453593600,,1353,4.296442687747035
8248960,5,B00133KFIK,Totally under-rated instructor. I love her and all of her work-outs.,1448841600,2,68,5.2727272727272725
8248961,4,B00133KFIK,"I have had this workout for some time and did it this morning for the first time in awhile. I found it in the circuit section of my workouts and realized while doing it that it's not a circuit workout, but rather a strength workout.  I think this miscategorization happened because I definitely get a cardio effect from the strength moves in this workout.  Many of the moves in this workout are compound moves where do an upper body move with a lower body move.  You even add in another component to those two sometimes.  So, if you like compound moves, this is a workout you might consider. Also, she puts a twist on traditional moves, which helped to keep the workout fresh for me.  She's innovative without making the moves seem unsafe or ""out there"".  Finally, she incorporates balance moves throughout the workout giving it a functional fitness twist.

She does build the moves, starting with the lower body usually and then adding in the upper body move.  She also has two background exercisers with her, one of whom does not use the step and who modifies for impact.  I thought the modifier was pretty good. You need two lighter weights, one heavier weight, a band, and the step is optional.  She says that they are using 5 pounds for the lighter weights and an 8 pounder for the heavier.

The biggest con of this workout is that she talks A LOT and then talks some more (and more and more and more).  All of her talk is appropriate to the workout - form pointers, counting down, encouragement, etc.  But, for those who do not like chatty instructors, this workout is NOT for you.  Because she focuses on the core in this workout, there are a number of twisty type moves.  For those with lower back issues, you might want to be careful when doing this workout.

I keep this workout because once in awhile it is just the right workout for me to do.  I find Angie to be encouraging and motivating and I do more with this workout than I often do with other workouts.  For example, today, I matched their weights. Since I am coming back from a really bad fitness year, this meant challenging myself to go up in weight.  I feel really worked out after having done that in a very good way.",1428537600,,2190,4.443609022556391
8248962,5,B00133KFIK,"I love Angie Miller's exercise DVDs. I currently rotate this tape with her Kettlebell Bootcamp as my daily exercise. One day I do Kettlebell routine and the next day use the free weights and cords for Core Strength and Fusion. I especially like the modifiers (she uses one in each exercise routine) as I am not strong enough yet to do all the exercises the way that Angie does them so I follow the modifiers on these. There is a learning curve for the routines as well as strength, stamina and endurance must be increased to do the entire workouts. I have been doing these routines for 6 months now and can see a tremendous change in my hips and legs. I am an older post menopausal woman that did very little exercise until my retirement in 2013.",1407024000,6,746,4.413043478260869
8248963,4,B00133KFIK,"This is the third workout I have tried from Angie Miller; I also own her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kettlebell-Bootcamp/dp/B001GIJRP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kettlebell Bootcamp</a>&nbsp;and have recently acquired&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bedroom-Body/dp/B008SCD6F8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bedroom Body</a>.  One of the things I like the best about Angie's workouts is that she always incorporates core and balance work throughout the ENTIRE routine.  She does this with the inclusion of many twisting moves plus lots of balance work on one leg.  I also like how Angie includes dynamic stretching in the warm-up and incorporates timed holds into the final stretch.

Equipment used for this workout includes two sets of dumbbells (Angie says she is using 8s & 5s), medium-resistance tubing, and an optional step.  Angie has two background exercisers with her, Michelle and Heather (who shows modifications, including working out without a step).  The DVD is well-chaptered, so you can easily mix-n-match segments to form your own premixes (e.g., Warm-Up, Dumbbells, & Stretch = 39 minutes; Warm-Up, Tubing, & Stretch = 29 minutes; or Warm-Up, Core, & Stretch = 25 minutes).

The Main Menu of this workout offers the following options:  Play All--Introduction--Warm-Up--Weights--Bands--Core--Cool-Down--Stretch.  I have broken out each segment in greater detail below.

WARM-UP (7 minutes)
Includes knee-ups, side-steps, hamstring curls, grapevines, v-steps, and knee-ups & lunges on step.  Finishes with dynamic stretches for hamstring and calf.

WEIGHTS (26 minutes)
Uses step for various squats, adding in knee lifts, bicep curls, and overhead presses.  Also curtsey lunges, side lunges, and lunges with lat rows.  Deadlifts with variations, included 1-legged and twisting.  Finish with squats off the step, adding shoulder press and leg abduction; end with balancing french press.

TUBING (16 minutes)
Lunges with reverse flyes and lat pull-downs.  Plie squats with tricep presses.  On step, bicep curls and squats.  From all fours, leg extensions, kicks, and raises.  Conclude with push-up variations, including side planks and slow push-ups.

CORE (12 minutes)
Start with standing side bends/reaches.  Move to floor for v-sits and then into various crunches, including oblique twists, reverse curls, and leg extensions.  Lying on the side, perform hip lifts and oblique crunches.  Finish with supermans and bird-dog.

STRETCH (6 minutes)
1 minute hold of lunge (hip flexor stretch).  Moving through standing forward bend, forward bend with twist, and brief upper body stretches.

Because the workout IS quite long when done in its entirety (about 68 minutes), I did the Core on one day and the remainder of the workout the next.  Each of these portions left me sore for days!  I actually liked Angie's core work here better than on her newer Bedroom Body.  Overall, this was a very good strength workout.  What makes it more unique is the addition of moves to address core and balance as well as the use of tubing to provide the muscles with a different type of challenge.  I think this workout is appropriate for intermediate-level exercisers who enjoy performing compound moves and using different types of equipment.  I recommend this DVD, and I'd rate it 4 1/2 stars.",1354406400,9,3379,5.789046653144016
8248964,2,B00133KFIK,"Only occasionally do I purchase a dvd on reviews alone... usually I go to the library, borrow from a friend, or watch clips online.  I borrowed this dvd from the library and gave it a try today.  Sadly, I found it boring and repetitive.  With little exception, it was made up of moves I'd seen before, all strung together.  Additionally, it requires a step, a resistance tube with handles, and two sets of weights.  Though there are modifications if you do not have the step, there are not for the tube or the weights.  I find this a bit of an inconvenience when there's so much available that requires no equipment at all.  Part of my boredom could come from the fact that it's quite long indeed -- over an hour even though I skipped a brief portion for which I did not have the right equipment (the resistance tube).  Occasionally, there's a hidden gem, like the oblique crunches in the ab sequence or the rowing motion in the weights portion.  But for the most part, this workout is made up of squats and lunges, lunges and squats.  It's certainly a workout, but not at all knee friendly!  And though I appreciate Ms. Miller's enthusiasm, her cuing is neither clear(She refers frequently to ""singles"" when there's no 'double' to compare it to... or says ""two singles"" while she does three) nor inspiring (she sounds like my grandma every time she says ""I'm glad you've joined us today"" and ""Make it worth your time"").
Finally, the stretch portion is entirely useless.  She has you stretch in a lunge position (again with the stress on the knees) for an entire clocked minute per side, and virtually nothing else!

If you're a newbie who hasn't seen everything yet, give it a try!  If you have zero knee sensitivity and are looking to improve your buns and thighs, give it a try! If you have a lot of time to dedicate and money to spend on equipment, give it a try! But if, like me, you are an avid home exerciser looking for a fun new workout, you'd best keep looking.",1349654400,3,1971,4.484593837535014

Her voice is very odd. Pitchy and weird with an upswing after every other word and if that's not enough, she talks way to slowly, as if talking to a child, there is no motivation in her voice and it doesn't match the exercise pace. I have never heard an instructor talk like that. However, after a few times, it doesn't matter anymore because this workout is so great.
Very challenging and not boring at all. Very advanced, excellent exercises, it makes you sweat, takes your heart rate up and makes you feel great and worked over! If you're serious about strength training, this workout is a must-have. She recommends a set of 5 and 8 lbs, I used 7 + 12 and was very challenged. I also used 3 lb ankle weights throughout.
