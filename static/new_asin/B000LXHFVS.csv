8165231,4,B000LXHFVS,"This one-man show is an entertaining and mostly factual account of Doc Holliday's years on the frontier, presented in the style of Hal Holbrook's ""Mark Twain Tonight."" Kit Hussey plays the West's most famous dentist in a script he also authored, which follows Holliday from his beginnings in Georgia to the shootout in October 1881 at (near, as he corrects the legend) the OK Corral in Tombstone, Arizona, alongside the Earp brothers - a shootout which is reenacted not once but twice.

His performance is a worthy parallel (and a corrective) to all the screen portrayals we have seen over the decades. The only fault is that Hussey is somewhat old for the part of a man who died at the age of 36. In all other respects, including his appropriately Southern accent, he seems to be a faithful reincarnation of the man. The play is performed before a live - and appreciative - audience. Recommended for those with a historical interest in both the era and the man who was Wyatt Earp's best friend.",1264118400,5,995,4.685714285714286
8165232,5,B000LXHFVS,"Outride The Devil is a treasure for Doc Holliday and Tombstone fans. So well done, one almost believes he has met John Henry Holliday! If their is a negative about this DVD, it is that it ends with Doc telling his audience ""that he will return for another session to discuss the Vendetta Ride."" Unfortunately....he passed before he could return for that session. Kit Hussey was incredible in his portrayal of Doc at the end of his days. I highly recommend this DVD to all students of Tombstone, Doc, Wyatt and the gunfight in Tombstone!",1253664000,3,536,4.652631578947369
8165233,4,B000LXHFVS,Being a student of Western History I thought the story was very well done and true to fact. If you are looking for an action flick this one is not for you. This movie is a stage play on the life of Doc Holliday in the interest of truth it was very very good.,1250640000,2,258,3.7962962962962963
8165234,5,B000LXHFVS,"VCI Entertainment present ""OUTRIDE THE DEVIL - A MORNING WITH DOC HOLLIDAY"" (2005) --- (Dolby digitally remastered) ... This critically praised original one-man show presents highlights of the last fourteen years of the life of Doc Holliday the frontier dentist, gambler and gunfighter and culminates with a re-enactment of the gunfight at the OK Corral ... from the Fort Worth Star Telegram review: ""Kit Hussey...may well own the definitive portrayal of the dentist turned gambler and gunfighter""... ""Hussey...provides a thunderous enactment of the nine-gun shootout ...John Henry ""Doc"" Holliday (August 14, 1851 - November 8, 1887) was an American dentist, gambler and gunfighter of the Old West frontier, who is usually remembered for his associations with Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral ... In a (probably ghost-edited) article in 1896, Wyatt Earp had this to say about Doc Holliday: ""Doc was a dentist whom necessity had made a gambler; a gentleman whom disease had made a frontier vagabond; a philosopher whom life had made a caustic wit; a long lean ash-blond fellow nearly dead with consumption, and at the same time the most skillful gambler and the nerviest, speediest, deadliest man with a gun that I ever knew.""

Doc was once asked if his killings had ever gotten on his conscience. Holliday is reported to have said ""I coughed that out with my lungs, years ago"" ... Big Nose Kate, however, remembered Doc's reaction after his role in the O.K. Corral gunfight. She reported that Doc came back to his room, sat on the bed, and wept. ""That was awful-- awful,"" said Doc ... the Gunfight only lasted 30 seconds!

Life-long lawman Virgil Earp, interviewed May, 30 1882, in The Arizona Daily Star (two months after Virgil had fled Tombstone after Morgan Earp's death), summed up Holliday ... ""There was something very peculiar about Doc. He was gentlemanly, a good dentist, a friendly man and yet, outside of us boys, I don't think he had a friend in the Territory ... tales were told that he had murdered men in different parts of the country; that he had robbed and committed all manner of crimes, and yet, when persons were asked how they knew it, they could only admit it was hearsay, and that nothing of the kind could really be traced to Doc's account. He was a slender, sickly fellow, but whenever a stage was robbed or a row started, and help was needed, Doc was one of the first to saddle his horse and report for duty.""

In 1887, now prematurely gray and ailing badly, Doc made his way to a hotel (the Hotel Glenwood) near the hot springs of Glenwood Springs, Colorado, hoping to take advantage of the reputed curative power of the waters. However, the sulfurous fumes from the spring may have done his lungs more harm than good, and Holliday eventually died in his hotel room, after being bedridden for two months ... In the end, it was tuberculosis that got Doc Holliday, at the age of 36. Fifteen years after the doctors gave him only months to live, he died peacefully in his hotel bed ... Kate helped care for Doc in the last months of his life, and was with him at the end ... Dying, Holliday asked for a drink of whiskey, and his reputed last words were ""This is funny."" Perhaps he was looking at his bootless feet. No one ever thought that he would die with his boots off, or in bed. Doc's dying words, however, are also a matter of speculation, and they are not reported by Kate or any contemporary account of his death ... Doc Holliday's grave is in Glenwood Springs cemetery. There is dispute about whether he is actually buried in his marked grave, or even in the cemetery itself ... he died in deep winter when the ground was frozen and was buried the same day in what was probably a temporary grave. This grave may not have been in the old cemetery, which was up a difficult road on the mountain. It is thus possible his body was never later relocated, but the truth is not known, since no exhumation has been attempted. If Doc is not in Glenwood Cemetery, he may be in somebody's back yard in modern Glenwood Springs city, at a lower altitude.(as noted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
