8201565,5,B000RNWE6I,I showed this to 8th graders for years in preparation for SS test in KY.  The video is good enough to hold their attention even when played by a substitute.  I have a viewing guide for it posted on teacherspayteachers for a dollar! =),1315699200,,234,4.295454545454546
8201566,4,B000RNWE6I,"This documentary, like the entire Schlessinger series, would be great for elementary and high school classes, especially during Black History Month.

I learned much about Ms. Truth.  This documentary exposed how entrenched slavery was in the North, not just the South.  I didn't know Ms. Truth learned Dutch as her first language.  I loved learning that she used the courts to her advantage, especially at a time when the courts were even more racist and sexist than they are now.

The documentary shows a Dr. Painter discussing slavery and her same quote was in the series' work on Harriet Tubman.  I guess when documentary makers have a good thing, they run with it.  Still, there will be many viewers that may see the Tubman and Truth works simultaneously and may resent this re-hashing of interviewers.  Who knew documentary makers cut and paste just as much as Microsoft Word users.  A male griot begins every installment of the series.  Though I'm sure the makers didn't intend it, but it was very gender-transgressive to hear a Black man saying/repeating, ""Ain't I a Woman?""  Like the Tubman installment, they interview a high school sophomore who I am sure is not a learned scholar.

I have a grave concern with this work.  The documentary implies, ""Wasn't it so great how S. Truth brought abolitionists and suffragettes together!?""  The work implies that anti-racist and anti-sexist activists of the time worked well with each other.  Second-wave feminists of all stripes have admitted how racist many 19th-Century, white feminists were.  When Ms. Truth says, ""Ain't I a woman?"", the work implies that she was responding to conservative men, but I heard she was responding to white women that did not want Black women anywhere near ""their"" cause.  When bell hooks used that phrase for his seminal text, it again was meant to highlight the monolithic ideas of many feminists.  People use Ms. Truth's famous phrase to begin discussion of how women are impacted by race and class, just as much as gender.  I think the documentary makers want white females and Blacks of all genders to admire Ms. Truth, but they were cowardly in not addressing the serious schisms that Ms. Truth was trying to address or cure.

At one point, the documentary shows a painting, possibly a photograph of Ms. Truth and President Lincoln.  It may be two pictures that they threw together.  Still, given the prejudice against interracial coupling in the 19th Century, I doubt this portrait was real or was not controversial.  He may have ""freed"" the slaves, but I'm sure President Lincoln did not embrace Ms. Truth the way Dubya could now embrace Leezy Rice.  This photo is conspicuous, but the documentary makers do nothing with it.",1167177600,,2716,4.931718061674009
