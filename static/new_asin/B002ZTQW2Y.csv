8523040,4,B002ZTQW2Y,"This an interesting documentary about a man who fought and won for everyone the early battles against censorship in the U.S. I was hoping for a bit more history of his early years in Chicago but I also realize that this story really focuses on the censorship struggle and his valiant work with his publishing company, Grove Press. Well worth watching for sure.",1443916800,,360,4.73015873015873
