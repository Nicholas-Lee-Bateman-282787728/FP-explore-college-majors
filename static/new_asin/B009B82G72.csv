8539143,4,B009B82G72,"Only 4 stars  because of her songs from Jack White's CD: ""The Party Ain't Over"" & the Chicago Brass back-up.  Not the real Wanda & a CD that I will stay away from. Her plane was late so she didn't have time to rehearse with a group that was new to her, but except for the lead singer, their music was good. The group had to entertain until Wanda finally arrived & they played some good R & R, too bad that Heath Haynes was such a lousy singer, but when Wanda came on, she came on strong. She never was a great yodeler and it showed when she did her yodel song.  The worst song was ""You Know I'm No Good"" and seeing how it came from Amy Whitehouse & Jack White, explains it all.  I wouldn't be surprised if she was the oldest one there as I saw some young ones, teenagers & a lot of 20-30 years old and only a few white ""caps"" in the audience and they were having a party to say the least.  For Wanda fans, this is for you.  +JMJ+",1390953600,,929,3.9148936170212765
8539144,4,B009B82G72,"The DVD shows a live Wanda Jackson Chicago stage show in 2011.  She performs most of her best material including, of course, Let's Have a Party.  The DVD includes her between song monolog, which was a standard during these touring years.  It's a big plus for those of you who want to hear her tell her legendary story in her own words.

I didn't find any sound level problems with the DVD (as mentioned by another reviewer), although some of you could certainly find fault with the recording and mix.  The vocals are a little too heavy in most of the mix, the lead guitar is often too weak in the mix, and the bottom end is too thin.  But I don't consider these major issues given the subject matter.  She performs four of the songs on her Jack White produced album ""The Party Ain't Over"" (2011) - including a three-piece horn section.  These are the best sounding songs on the DVD.  In all, her show portion of the DVD runs for over 90 minutes!

The Nashville-based backing band, Heath Haynes and the Hi-Dollars, seemed under rehearsed for her 1950's-'60's material.  They were OK, but not as good as I've seen from more country-western rooted bands that have backed Wanda at shows, such as Minnesota's Hillbilly Voodoo Dolls.  too bad they weren't the backing band on this DVD.

The DVD extras includes about 25 minutes of the Hi-Dollars opening set and, more importantly, an additional seven minute interview with Wanda.  Grab the DVD - Wanda's not getting any younger.  If a better DVD comes along, grab it too!",1390348800,,1515,4.600746268656716
8539145,5,B009B82G72,"Live In Chicago with Wanda Jackson is fine entertainment. She does 17 incredible numbers, and the crowd loves her. Particular favorites are Shakin' All Over, Rip It Up, Funnel Of Love, Right Or Wrong, I Saw The Light, Mean Mean Man, Let's Have A party, and Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On. I have met Wanda and she is very gracious to her fans. Her show in person is unforgettable, and this is as close as you can get to that, if you can't get to a show in your area. She is the Queen of Rock.",1382486400,,490,4.114583333333333
8539146,3,B009B82G72,"As a life long Wanda Jackson fan (and I'm only 32) I could not wait to own this DVD. Sadly, it's a disappointment. My biggest problem with this DVD is the audio. Wanda comes in loud and clear (and sounds great, as always) but the band is awful. I know this band can rock right along with Wanda, but for some reason, the audio on this DVD is so low that it ruined the whole show for me. I think if the band/audience audio was enhanced, it would be a pretty good DVD, but with the low sound, it's kind of hard to get into it. A release like this was something I have been waiting on forever. I wish whoever filmed the show took notice of the audio. I give this DVD 3 stars simply because it's Wanda Jackson...the Queen of Rock n Roll. If you have never been to a Wanda Jackson show, do yourself a favor and go! Don't rely on this DVD. If you want to really hear Wanda Jackson LIVE (with great audio) I'd recommend ""Wanda Jackson: Live and Still Kickin'"" or Wanda Jackson ""Live at Mr. Lucky's."" Granted, those are only recordings and not video, but you will still get to hear Wanda ROCK live.",1361577600,,1089,4.165876777251185

8539148,5,B009B82G72,"Having seen Wanda Jackson in Adelaide, South Australia at the ""Gov"",I really wanted this DVD to be as good as her gig. And it is!! Amazing performance both here (in Chicago) and live (for me) in Adelaide. What a voice, can't believe how good it is for a lady born in in 1937!! Maybe she doesn't move around on stage as much as earlier years, but this lady still ROCKS big time. Hard to believe that none of her hits reached the Top Twenty in the US, but in Australia ""Let's Have a Party"" made it to #3 in January '61 and stayed in the top 10 for 8 weeks. Simply put, she's a living legend. Rick Drewer, Adelaide,South Australia",1356998400,,627,4.233333333333333
