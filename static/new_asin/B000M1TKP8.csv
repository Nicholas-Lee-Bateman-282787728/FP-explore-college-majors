8165643,3,B000M1TKP8,"DVD footage is excellent! I like the way the DVD footage is organized by each airport. On the down side, I did not see any TYO 747 1988 cockpit footage; also I did not hear ANY air traffic control interaction with aircraft in the DVD. The product description is a little misleading, but overall the DVD is an excellent buy. Picture quality is perfect and the sound is ""out of this world""!",1176854400,2,388,4.402777777777778
