7938264,3,B00005IAQU,"Nothing like Shaloin Vs Lama which also stars Alexander Lou.  I didn't like the the frequent use of semi nude women, I mean I love seeing naked chicks, just not in a Kung Fu movie.  Then they threw in a zombie and that was it for me.  I had to turn it off.  I was hoping this film would have a more traditional feel to it like how a good Western could capture that era using authentic weapons and clothing.",1344211200,,406,4.0375
7938265,3,B00005IAQU,"Well, the film is good but once again its reflect the typical chinese movie makers time-life case: Chinese Kung fu is better and stronger than all Japanese arts ! in chinese films you can see Kung fu player can beat Karate ,Bushido , Ninja ,etc....... moreover you find in this kind of films one kung fu player can beat ten Karate ,bushido or Ninja !!!!!!",1306454400,,355,4.476923076923077
7938266,5,B00005IAQU,This is a lesser known and very underrated martial arts film. Im still waiting for the Complete Uncut version. Very fast paced with great fighting Choreography. Shoalin temple is destroyed. The evil Abbot white along with his 3 Ninja cohorts are responsible. Will the 2 surviviing warrior decsendants be able to get revenge or is Abbot whites Wu Tang style along with the Ninjas be too much for them?,1266796800,,400,4.811594202898551
7938267,4,B00005IAQU,"This is a really fun movie. It is quite cheezy, 70's style kung fu with terrible dubbing but if you don't take it too seriously (the movie does not take itself seriously) you will really enjoy it. Hardly a minute passes without either some crazy kung fu action or some unbelievably bad acting, costumes, or hair to make you laugh. There is actually quite a bit of impressive movie style kung fu here, but the real joy of this movie is the campy old school attitude. Recommended, especially if you are going to watch with friends who also enjoy this sort of thing.",1010707200,3,563,4.475728155339806
