1899331,5,B0000A02TX,Just received word from Jon Mulvaney at Criterion that the upcoming release of The Silence will be Bergman's unedited version of the film and not the compromised American edit.  The same goes for the other films included in the box.  This will be an astounding DVD set and I encourage all of you world cinema fans to pre-order it.,1059523200,11,330,4.576271186440678

1899338,5,B0000A02TX,"First I want to point out: whether you agree or not with Bergman's religious outlook in these films, please don't mark reviews unhelpful based on bias.  These are not 'atheist' films as others have said.  Bergman did not intend these films to be a trilogy.  Many people link them together for their dealings with belief and spirituality, but Bergman himself ties them together in retrospect for their dealing with 'reduction' (in his own words).  In fact, the Silence doesn't specifically deal with the nature of belief, but it is implied.  The first two films directly question belief and though they do not push a message of atheism, they show the difficulties people in modern (then) times have with faith.  Also a note: these are the first three films with Sven Nyquist as his cinematographer.

The first film, Through a Glass Darkly, has only 4 actors.  Bergman himself laments on the frequent lighting 'mishaps' but insists that in referring to the pace and editing of the film calls it a nearly perfect film in those regards.  The film was awarded an Oscar for Best Foreign Film.  The film explores Karin's mental illness, she is played wonderfully by Harriet Andersson.  Gunnar Bjrnstrand plays her father, a writer struggling with writer's block who uses his daughter's illness as inspiration.  Gunnar Bjrnstrand had issues playing his role in the film, and his acting is not quite up to the level as it was in earlier films.  Also, the actor playing Minus was fresh out of acting school, so his performance was sometimes wooden.  Max von Sydow was great, but Bergman lamented that he didn't include him in more scenes.  Throughout the film we see the duality of things, up to the duality of the God/Spider creature.  Bergman isn't saying God is a spider, but he just brings up the question, 'Why can't Karin believe that God appears as a spider?'  There is also major insinuation of an incestuous encounter.  And another note: the final scene was forced on by the studio.  Bergman had wanted to end with the previous scene.  It is a totally awkward finale, and it makes sense in retrospect since it was against his better judgement to add it.

Some spoilers ahead:

The second film, Winter Light, is probably my favorite of the 'trilogy'.  In it Gunnar Bjrnstrand plays a priest grappling with faith.  But what the film is really about is the death of two people.  The death of the priest (metaphorically) and the death of Jonas.  The film is about each man's relationship with the woman nearest to them.  In the priest's case it is the schoolteacher who repulses him at times, yet he is unable to push away.  Jonas' poisoned relationship is with his wife.  Bergman and Nyquist got the lighting right in this film.  The only scene I wasn't mad about was the outdoor scene where the priest is guarding Jonas' body.  It seemed disparate from the rest of the film.  The train crossing was actually one of the BEST scenes in this or almost any Bergman films (Dance with Death in 7th Seal was pretty great also).  It really was the most powerful image from the film, the tanker cars passing by, black with an appearance evocative of coffins.  In the end the message is: things might happen, but Communion must go on!  This was a message Bergman took from his father while scouting churches for filming.  Also, Gunnar Bjrnstrand was very ill while filming, and Bergman worked this into the film very well.  The hunchback in speaking to the priest near the end delivers a great little scene.

The third film is The Silence.  This was really a film that is more important as a precursor to Persona.  In this we see two women, but really it seems they are each half of the other.  The setting is in a country nearing war, it takes place in a hotel as the women and the son are returning home.  What is interesting is the use of sound in this film.  Inside the hotel all is very quiet.  There is very little dialogue in the entire film.  When one of the characters leaves the hotel we hear the bedlam of the busy street.  The only other noise we really hear are from the midget performers and then the tank in the street.  This is a film of images, some startling.  Some people have called it 'pornographic' but Bergman wasn't trying to shock people with two sex scenes (both were pretty tame by modern standards).  This is the one film of the trilogy that I don't see myself re-watching multiple times.  I find it interesting to read about, and the imagery is great, but it seems to give me less from repeat viewings than the previous two.

If you are a fan of Bergman, then this is a great release.  Criterion has performed their light handed touch up mastery and everything is in crisp and clear glory.  The set itself also includes many special features, including a great documentary of Bergman making Winter Light (146 minutes).  There are also the usual essays, which were all included in the original Criterion releases of these films (before they decided to put them together).  If you own each of these films on the individual Criterion Collection, then you would be paying a lot for the extra documentary and the box, so I might recommend passing in that case.  These are all the EXACT same films and booklets as the individual releases, down to the special features on each disc (mainly Peter Cowie interviews and some commentary).  If you are looking to add these to your collection, this set is a splendid purchase.  I highly recommend these films for any Bergman fan.

I would warn however, if you haven't seen a Bergman film, perhaps start with Smiles of a Summer Night, 7th Seal, or even Wild Strawberries (my personal favorite Bergman film).  These films are a transition from the earlier works with more obvious metaphor and often lighthearted touches towards the later films marked with pain and self loathing.  I would also say watch these films before watching Persona or Cries and Whispers, two of his greatest achievements, but they are better understood after watching more of his catalog.  I would also recommend reading:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Images-My-Life-in-Film/dp/1611450411/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Images: My Life in Film</a>, an autobiography of sorts about Bergman's films and his meanings behind each.  Of course it might ruin a film with a 'surprise' ending, but Bergman doesn't really have any of those types of films, so pre-reading won't really spoil much.",1346198400,,6452,4.814376706096452
1899339,4,B0000A02TX,"I found Bergman's film of Mozart's opera neither the unalloyed masterpiece of some critics,
nor the failure of others. To me it represented a perfectly enjoyable attempt to bring opera
to the masses (remember this was made for TV), while not quite being a masterwork.

There are a lot of moments of just plain fun; in the story, the singing, the costumes, the images.
But there are failed ideas as well.

Operating on a small budget, Bergman tries to walk a fine line of keeping the opera set in a theater,
while 'opening it up' with camera angles, and sets that would never work in a real theater. Not
a bad concept, but the constant cuts to audience reactions (especially those of his own daughter)
becomes increasingly distracting, and there are times where some of the theatrical artifice, seen
up close, just seems clunky, not magical.

As a result, you never can 'believe in' the story, but you also don't get the grandeur and magic of
a great stage production. You DO get an intimacy with the characters and their feelings, which is great
where those are interesting, not so good in those moments where the story itself (as opposed to
Mozart's sublime music) is a bit silly, contradictory and shallow.",1336521600,,1208,4.7156398104265405
1899340,5,B0000A02TX,"Perhaps the most amazing thing about Bergman's huge body of work is how his style continued to grow and evolve, even
as he was drawn again and again to the great questions in life; is there a God?  How do we face death?  What is the
meaning of being here?  Can we be happy?  Can people be kind to each other, or are we doomed only to cause harm?  Is love real?

Yet, while the themes stay consistent, how he approached them varied wildly over 50 years of film-making, from the uber-experimental,
groundbreaking poetic surrealism of ""Persona"", to the highly symbolic ""Seventh Seal"", to his later works, more grounded in naturalism and
day-to-day realism, but no less profound for it.  Pieces like ""Scenes From a Marriage"", or ""Cries and Whispers"".

These three films, which I've heard referred to as ""the Faith Trilogy"", ""The Silence of God"" trilogy, or simply ""The Trilogy"" as Criterion labels
them, represent a paradoxic step forward from his earlier work.  On one hand they are more poetic, subtle, works - even the highly surreal
""The Silence"" is more fragile and etherial than, say, the earlier ""Virgin Spring"".  The film making is more stylized, from the never moving camera
of ""Winter's Light"" with it's very self conscious framings, and six minute long monologues, to the almost Fellini-esque ""The Silence"".

On the other hand, the performances themselves are even more grounded in the kind of  understated hyper-realism that was Bergman's ever
growing trademark.

While not my personal favorites of Bergman's work (I am most attached to his later pieces) these are still must-see, if not 'easy' films, for any
fan of grown up thoughtful film-making.  The direct depth with which they ponder the meaning of existence, and the depths of despair that
struggle for meaning can bring is breathtaking, if sometimes hard to take.  The work of his actors is consistently amazing, and the images are unique
and unforgettable.

These are films that only grow with time, and re-visiting, so owning copies is worth-while. There's no way to get all the levels of these
existential explorations at one go.  And the Criterion transfers - as is almost always the case - are first rate.

Some specific notes on the films from my 'film diary':

Through a Glass Darkly (1961)
My personal favorite of Bergman's earlier works, I find this tremendously moving and haunting in equal degree.

Bergman is still dealing with some of the same big issues (Is there a god?, What's the meaning of art?, etc.) but now on a much more human
level. The preachiness is gone, and the characters are no longer archetypes. Just human beings struggling with the difficulties of living.

Phenomenal, understated performances all around, and beautiful cinematography more than compensate for occasional hints of staginess in
this chamber drama with just 4 characters; a father, his son and schizophrenic daughter, and her husband who loves her in spite of her illness.

All the characters are human, identifiable, occasionally ugly, and always true. This film led to me thinking much more deeply about my own
life then the impressive, but more on-the-nose cosmic questioning of 'The Seventh Seal' or even 'Wild Strawberries'.

Winter Light (1962)
I was slightly less affected by this than by `Through a Glass Darkly', which opens the trilogy, though a number of critics rank it higher, and
a couple call it one of the greatest films ever made.

Certainly, once again the acting is terrific, and the cinematography superb. More even than `Through a Glass Darkly' this film mines
the subtle shadings of the human face to an almost supernatural degree.

But this film returns to Bergman's early tendency to be more on-the-nose with his themes. It's the story itself. A pastor has
lost his faith, in the face of God's silence at the dark things of life. But in this story, just about everyone has surrendered to that
sort of hopeless depression, so the film feels more one note, more talky and `heady' than `Through a Glass Darkly', if more quiet
and subtle in its approach than the early Bergman works.

It's not just that the characters don't change that bothers me, its that it feels clear from the outset there is no hope of change, which
made me feel I'd already gotten the power of the film's questioning and aching loss (which is still considerable) long before its final moments.

None-the-less, how rewarding to see any film that is about the big questions, and addresses them in a serious, beautifully made way.
And I do find it haunting me since I've seen it.

The Silence (1963)
My first reaction was the same I've had to many of Bergman's earlier films: deep admiration, but not personal
adoration. In this case, the more extreme, self-conscious surreal style threw me off. This feels more like
something by Bunuel, Fellini, Beckett or Lynch (all of whom I love).

Two sisters, polar opposites - one sensual, emotional, promiscuous, self-centered, representing the body, the id.
The other, intellectual, sickly, sexually isolated stands for mind or super ego. The child of one, perhaps 8 years
old, is accompanying them on a train trip, heading home. We never know where they're coming from or why
they went. They stop in a city clearly preparing for war, or under some sort of military occupation. They stay
in a baroque but almost abandoned hotel, unable to communicate with anyone, since this unknown land has a
language none of them speak.

While one sister picks up lovers, and the other languishes ill in bed, the boy explores the creepy hotel (""The Shining""
was definitely influenced by this), making friends with a circus full of dwarf performers, who, pointedly, are the most
normal people in the film.

All of this is done with very little dialogue (to the point where the effect feels forced and self- conscious at times). I
had a hard time clicking in while watching the film, but images and moments have really stuck with me, and there's
good reason why so many intelligent critics think it's a masterpiece.  And certainly the exploration of surrealism here
helped prepared him for the leap to one of his greatest achievements, ""Persona"".",1335312000,3,6127,4.901258470474347
1899341,1,B0000A02TX,"All three movies have a point to make.  You are isolated and alone in this life and there is no hope.  There's pretty much nobody that can help you.  What a message to share, so much better than the Gospel of Jesus Christ, wouldn't you say!  Bergman had a shabby existence, so he wants to prove God doesn't exist, as though he is the spokesman for all mankind and all of our experiences relate to these three stories.  These movies are a diatribe against Jesus Christ, whome he mocks in Winter Light in several scenes.  He mocks God and calls him a spider in two movies.  From what I've read of Bergman, it makes sense that he would write such garbage.",1324252800,7,652,4.338842975206612
1899352,5,B0000A02TX,"In the early 60s Ingmar Bergman made a series of three films which have been called his ""chamber films,"" meaning that they each involve a very small number of characters in an isolated location during a short period of time. They deal with themes of religious doubt due to God's apparent silence as well as the difficulties of finding solace in other human beings. I do not recommend these films for the viewer who has never seen a Bergman film. However, if you have enjoyed his religion-themed films such as the Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, and the Virgin Spring, then these films will concentrate and intensify ideas and themes brought up in those films. These works are stark pieces that use little action and minimal dialogue to express very strong emotions. They are not at all difficult to understand, but they lend themselves easily to differing interpretations from each viewer. The films are Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light, and the Silence. Criterion's boxed set has few special features, but each film features an approximately 10-minute introduction from a film critic. I found these to be very worthwhile introductions to help me understand the films I was about to see without giving away any plot spolers. There is also a 4th disc: a 2 1/2 hour documentary by Bergman collaborator Vilgot Sjolman (who later went on to direct the political and sexual coming of age semi-documentaries I Am Curious-Yellow and I Am Curious-Blue&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Curious-I-Am-Curious-Yellow-I-Am-Curious-Blue-Set-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00007L4I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Curious... (I Am Curious Yellow / I Am Curious Blue Set) (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;[you can read my 4 star review]) about the making of Winter Light called Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie.

THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY reuintes Gunnar Bjornstrand and Max von Sydow from the Seventh Seal. Bjornstrand is a novelist who has been away from home for a long time trying to write a book. Von Sydow is married to Bjornstrand's daughter Karin who is suffering from an extreme case of schizophrenia. The four of them (including Karin's younger brother) are vacationing on an isolated island. The family deals with the father's long absense and Karin's deteriorating mental condition. In Karin's hallucinations she is part of a group of people who wait expectantly for God to come through a door. God's absence is frustrating until Karin has a very unexpected and disturbing vision of him. Her father has no real reason to believe in God at all but is desperate to hold on to the idea that God is love. This is a fantastic story, character driven, simply told through sights and sounds with little expository dialogue. It is both a powerful drama about coping with a loved one's mental illness and a damn fine exploration into difficult faith and honest doubt. I give this film 5 stars.

WINTER LIGHT takes Through a Glass Darkly's already concentrated themes and makes them even starker. The idea of God's silence no longer takes second place to mental illness but is now front and center. Gunnar Bjornstrand and Max von Sydow are together again. This time Bjornstrand plays a widowed Lutheran pastor who is losing his faith, having relationship-threatening problems with his sometimes girlfriend, and struggling to keep a dying church afloat -- all while fighting a bad flu. Von Sydow plays a member of the church who goes to the pastor for counselling when he is terrified and depressed over the threat of nuclear war. Sydow is one of my favorite actors. Usually he plays fairly authoritative, strong men, and I have never seen him as despondent and helpless as the role he plays here. Great performances and tight cinematography drive this film which asks if God is silent because he does not exist and forces each viewer to answer the question for oneself. I give this film 5 stars. If there were more than 5 stars it would get them all.

THE SILENCE is kind of the odd one in the trilogy. It is about two sisters Ester and Anna. Ester is dying from a chronic illness. She, Anna, and Anna's young son Johan take a train to an unspecified foreign country where they don't understand a word of the language (and is apparently on the brink of war) and stay at semi-deserted hotel where apparently the only other guests are a group of little-people actors. It is not specified why they have taken this trip, but it seems like they felt the need to go somewhere and do something before Ester became too ill and it was too late. The trip does not go as planned.  Ester's illness gets worse, Anna seeks meaningless sex with whomever, Johan is mostly ignored and left to walk the hotel halls, and all of their relationships fall apart. Through a Glass Darkly and Winter Light fit together very nicely with similar themes and even some of the same actors. The Silence, however, does not seem like it belongs. Aside from the filming techniques and intensified alienation it has very little to do with the previous two films. In fact God is not mentioned once in the entire film. It is as if Bergman, having already established God's silence, now silences the discussion of God's silence and proceeds fo focus on interpersonal silence and alienation. This is a worthwhile film with interesting visuals and powerful emotion. It is also infamous for its controvercial (for the time) nudity and sex/masturbation scenes. The sex scenes are good, but they do tend to be more creepy than arousing. That's possibly the point. Although I enjoyed this movie, I found it confusing and relatively pointless. I give it 3 stars, which is the lowest ranking I have ever given a Bergman film. (Every Bergman film I have seen has been 5 stars [Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Virgin Spring, Fanny & Alexander, Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light] except for Persona which I consider 4 stars because it is so weird.)

INGMAR BERGMAN MAKES A MOVIE is the best making-of documentary I have ever seen. It is possibly the best DVD special feature I have ever seen. It is 2 1/2 hours of the making of Winter Light; an hour longer than the actual movie. It covers every aspect of filmmaking from script and rehersal to shooting, editing, and even Bergman's response to the reviews. The very best part of this documentary is Vilgot Sjolman's extended interviews with Bergman. Sjolman knows how to ask interesting, thoughtful, and hard-hitting questions. Bergman answers candidly, hides little, and never evades a question. This isn't just a documentary about making a movie. This is a documentary about ideas and how they evolved in Ingmar Bergman's head. What I found to be the single most interesting thing about this film is the realization that my interpretation of God's silence in Glass and Winter is completely different from Bergman's interpretation. I see it as more pessimistic, skeptical, agnostic. Bergman has a more religious outlook, seems convinced that God does exist as love, sees the films as more positive and full of hope. And that is the beauty of great art - it leaves itself open to different interpretations based on what the viewer brings to it. 5 stars.

Two outstanding movies, one good movie, and an amazing documentary in a fine-looking boxed set with perfect picture, detailed booklets, and video discussions of the films. Highly recommended for all Ingmar Bergman fans and anyone interesting in hard-hitting movies that deal honestly with faith and doubt. I recommend this series unreservedly to those who are skeptical of religion, but I think many sincere religious people will find it to be a valuable experience as well.",1315353600,2,7668,5.010196078431372
1899353,5,B0000A02TX,"I found this to be a magical rendition of one of my favorite operas. As the previous reviewer noted, Bergman does somewhat deconstruct the opera. However, I did not find this in the least annoying, but rather found it increased my enjoyment. Opera is a highly artificial art form, and showing it in a lighter vein I found useful, for it emphasizes its artificiality. So, I highly recommend this version, especially for those who have enjoyed works of Bergman such as Fanny and Alexander.",1288224000,4,487,4.809523809523809
1899354,4,B0000A02TX,"Each of these films stand on their own, but they are really remarkable when viewed as a trilogy. Although the mini-documentaries on each film are nice, I always like it when Criterion does commentary tracks, so I miss that here. These films offer an essential bridge between the world of Seventh Seal with the world of Fanny And Alexander. Essential to understanding this seminal director.",1267660800,,389,5.0
1899355,5,B0000A02TX,"After ""Four Masterworks"", this is definately the best Bergman boxset. Some veiwers may find the few, very brief, sexual scenes in ""The Silence"", a lttle offensive, or possibly pleasant- I can't resist saying that when Gunnel Lindblom uses a wash-basin in the hotel room for a few seconds, that, (although completely innocent), it's still one of the sexiest things I've ever seen. One of those simple things, that far outweighs anything that goes way out of it's way to be sexy! But really, it's the story here, and her little son's curious adventures around the big, old hotel, (and some of it's characters), which hearkens back memories of earlier, classic Bergman.
  I enjoyed the other movies, in the set, and am looking forward to checking out ""Eclipse 1"".
  A word of warning.... Stay away from the boxset that features ""Persona"", etc. ""Serpent's Egg"" is almost good, but just gets too crude, in spots. There's a differance between ""crude"" and ""sexy"". To use some sophisticated intellectual terminology,that set is just plain: ""poopie"".",1230681600,,1041,5.0701754385964914
1899356,5,B0000A02TX,"Ingmar Bergman's three films between 1961 and 1963 have often been grouped together as the ""Chamber Trilogy"". Smitted by his newlywed wife, the Estonian pianist Kabi Lareti, Bergman compared the simple plots and small casts of SASOM I EN SPEGEL (Through a Glass Darkly), NATTVARDSGAESTERNA (The Communicants, released in the US as ""Winter Light"") and TYSNADEN (The Silence) to chamber music. He even linked the three together, calling the first two meditations on religious certainty and the third their ""negative imprint"".

As SASOM I EN SPEGEL opens, we see four people coming in from a swim in the cold Baltic Sea. The novelist David (Gunnar Bjornstrand) has returned home after a sabbatical in a distant country, reuniting at their summer home with his son Minus (Lars Passgard), daughter Karin (Harriet Andersson) and her husband Martin (Max von Sydow). Karin has suffered from some time from schizophrenia, though she had regained lucidity to a degree. Four characters is all it takes. The plot is driven through Karin's illness, Minus' awkward budding manhood, and David's self-centeredness and uninterest in his family's plight. Though wracked by delusions, Karin ultimately provides a key insight about Man's place in the world. The superb quality of Andersson's acting can be judged by how uncomfortably close to home it hits this viewer, who had a loved one suffering from schizophrenia. This was the first Bergman film where Sven Nykvist was principal cinematographer, and there's a certain purity to the shots, as if they were sculpted from marble, compared to his later work.

Things are pared down even more in NATTVARDSGAESTERNA, perhaps the smallest Bergman film in scale as it takes place between noon and three o'clock on a wintry Swedish afternoon. As the film opens, the priest Thomas (Gunnar Bjoernstrand) presides over Sunday services with a meagre congregation. In a bold extended scene, Bergman captures the entire Lutheran liturgy from the ""Lamb of God"" to the dismissal. While the parishioners are mainly bored or distracted, Thomas seems iron-cast in his faith. But subsequent events reveal his tormenting uncertainty on the existence of God and the meaning of life. He proves unable to comfort a parishioner (Max von Sydow) consumed by fear of nuclear war, nor is he able to sustain his long but rocky relationship with the village schoolmarm Marta (Ingrid Thulin). Bergman broke new ground in cinematic storytelling in NATTVARDSGAESTERNA, and not only in the opening scene. When Thomas reads a letter from Marta, the text is delivered by her in soliloquy, speaking directly to the camera in two long shots. Indoor scenes are driven by dialogue, while in outdoor scenes, reflecting the grim Swedish winter, there is little talking at all.

While the characters of NATTVARDSGAESTERNA experience great pain due to their inability to see God and relate with their fellow human beings, this is not an entirely bleak film. I have always seen an element of reconciliation in the closing shots, the one time in Bergman's oeuvre where hope is still clearly alive.

But that sudden peace with God was not to last, for in the last film of the trilogy He is completely absent. As TYSNADEN opens, two very different sisters sit in a train compartment. Anna (Gunnel Lindblom) is scantily dressed, animal in her sexuality with her profuse sweating and panting and unkempt hair. Her young son Johan sits beside her. Esther (Ingrid Thulin) is prim and polite. As Esther coughs up blood, we discover that she is also terminally ill. These three are travelers returning home through a foreign land, a country on the brink of war to judge from the train carrying tanks which passes by in the opposite direction. The three check into a hotel while Esther can rest in bed. Anna explores the city as if shopping for meat, while Johan is left to wonder around the eerily quiet himself, running away from the eccentric caretaker and briefly hanging out with a circus troupe of Spanish dwarves. Anna's escapades torment Esther, who can do nothing but drink and writhe in pain.

I take Bergman's comment about ""the negative imprint"" to mean that against the previous two films, we can see in TYSNADEN this is really what life is reduced to when religious faith is unsustained. TYSNADEN is the first of Bergman's films to focus mainly on psychology and human relationships, inaugurating a style which was to continue through the 1960s and early 1970s.

The key to TYSNADEN, increasingly clear on repeated viewings, is that these two sisters, the one Apollonian and the other Dionysian, are but two parts of one personality. But once that became clear, I have to admit my evalution of the film suffered. While even a poor Bergman film is light-years beyond most cinematic efforts, TYSNADEN now seems to be like a clunky prototype for 1966's PERSONA, one of Bergman's greatest achievements. Indeed, one wonders all the more if Bergman considered PERSONA a more advanced take on these themes when book Johan reads while sitting in bed is Lermontov's ""A Hero in Our Time"", the same book read by the older boy in the stunning opening montage of PERSONA.

Other reviewers have commented on the extras. While not as a extensive as one could hope for, personally I'm just grateful these films are available at all. And the addition of Vilgot Sjoman's documentary INGMAR BERGMAN MAKES A MOVIE is a nice touch, allowing one to witness not only the creation of what I consider Bergman's best film, but also the general phenomenon of the auteur filmmaker in action.",1228521600,,5555,5.0119176598049835
1899357,5,B0000A02TX,"A God steps down from the mountain:  ""Through a Glass Darkly""

Although Bergman considers ""Through a Glass Darkly"" to be a failure (and, to a certain extent, I agree), it was an important step (he says) in liberating himself from the gloomy Lutheran theology of his childhood. Ostensibly, the story is about the relapse of Karin (Harriet Andersson) into mental illness--a relapse, one suspects, which is incurable. Karin is convinced that a god lives on the other side of a strangely papered wall (in fact, Bergman's original title for the film was ""The Wallpaper""). It's a god of darkness and sensuality (at one point, Karin orgasms in solitude with her god; at another, she fancies that the god has entered her younger brother Musin [Lars Passgard] and she seduces him), but ultimately it's a god that reveals itself as a horrible, devouring spider.

Bergman's point seems to be that the gods which attract us ultimately reveal themselves to be monstrous destroyers--or, perhaps, that humanity can't survive in the presence of the absolute it so craves. While Karin's godlust drives her into madness, her novelist father (Gunnar Bjornstrand) discovers toward the film's end that the only real god is love, the only safeguard against madness is companionship, and the only chance of fulfillment in this life is learning to love and be loved.

The ending, as Bergman himself notes, is overly didactic (although Musin's ""Papa spoke to me!"", the final line in the film, gestures at the ending of the later and better ""The Silence""). Moreover, as Bergson notes, the father character never quite seems authentic, and even a fine actor like Bjornstrand can't breathe life into him. But flawed as the film is, it's still a thoughtful (and perhaps Jungian-inspired?) exploration of the human yearning for gods and what happens when the gods honor our yearning and step down from their mountains. And Harriet Andersson's performance throughout is absolutely breathtaking.

When God goes silent--what then?:  ""Winter Light""

At one point in this best of all Bergman films, the despairing pastor Tomas (Gunnar Bjornstrand) realizes that life would be comprehensible if there is no God. All the paradoxes and dilemmas of faith would vanish, and evil, revealed to be meaningless and nonpurposeful, would at least no longer be mysterious. This realization immediately leads into Tomas' final loss of the last shreds of his faith. The silence of God which has been tormenting him is at least seen to be a necessary silence, and that realization gives him a momentary sense of liberation.

But it also leads to a troubling existential quandary: when God goes silent, once and for all, how does one lead one's life? How can broken, lonely, and frightened people make meaningful contact with one another? How can long-held habits of relying on what Tomas comes to call an ""echo God""--an imagined deity who tells you exactly what you want to hear--be broken? How does one manage not, as Marta says, to ""hate yourself to death""?

Bergman's ""Winter Light"" is an exploration of these questions (and surely is as autobiographical as it is philosophical). There are no definitive answers here. A life liberated by God's silence is still a life full of ambiguity and suffering, disappointment and unfulfillment. The silence of God--of ultimate meaning and purposefulness to the universe--is still a Christ-like passion many of us must endure in our own Gethsemanes. But the end of ""Winter Light,"" with Tomas acknowledging the hear-and-now presence of Marta, offers some hope, filtered even as it is through the winter light of a new and godless world.

The Long Loneliness:  ""The Silence""

I can think of no better portrait of alienation and loneliness than Bergman's ""The Silence,"" which I think is one of his three best films. Everything about the film suggests silence, emptiness, aloneness: the huge, baroque, but strangely empty hotel; the silent lonely crowd that fills the streets; the ominous preparations for war; the inability of Anna and Ester to speak the language of the country in which they're stranded; the loveless, desperate coupling of Anna and the waiter she picks up; the frigid, despairing masturbation of Ester; the hotel porter's nostalgic but sad fondness for photographs of his past.

The essential thing is that the sisters Anna and Ester, for all their estrangement from one another, really are kindred. Bergman seems to be suggesting that they represent two irreducible aspects of personality, sensuality and intellect, and that individuals suffer from an inner sense of fragmentation if the two are unreconciled. (In this regard, the message of ""The Silence"" is not unlike Hermann Hesse's in Narcissus and Goldmund.) So the exterior loneliness in his film is mirrored by the interior loneliness personified by the sisters' feud.

At the end of the film, the silence is broken by Ester's final note to her nephew, Johan, a ""translation of words in a foreign language."" Words are what create communities. They bind humans together. As such, the end of the film offers a possibility that the long loneliness can be ameliorated by a human invention. In the last analysis, that's all there.

The acting in ""The Silence"" is superb, from beginning to end. Ingrid Thulin's Ester is frozen, emotionally blocked, but yearning for connection. Gunnel Lindblom's Anna is a sullen carnality that occasionally breaks out in despairing loneliness. Jorgen Lindstrom's Johan is inquisitive, innocently absorbing the world around him. And Hakan Jahnberg's porter, while silent for most of the film, masterfully and poignantly expresses all he needs to in his gestures and face.",1215388800,,5664,5.141304347826087

Bach's cello suite, Harriet Andersson's performance and God's presence as a spider will shook you for life. Masterpiece.

**** 1962. WINTER LIGHT. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Three hours of a pastor's life in the Swedish countryside. Gunnar Bjrnstrand doesn't manage to find the right words to prevent Max von Sydow's suicide. Note also the 6 minutes long close-up of Ingrid Thulin reading the letter she sent to Gunnar Bjrnstrand, a scene that has nothing to envy to the then recent innovations of the French New Wave. WINTER LIGHT is an austere and ascetic film worthy to stay in your library. Highly recommended.

***** 1963. THE SILENCE. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Three Swedish Academy awards (Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress). Two sisters argue in an hotel room while Johan, a 10 years old kid, is discovering the corridors and the strange guests of the hotel. The train compartment, the hotel room and the town, three claustrophobic places that Ester and Anna can't leave while Johan seems to be the only one able to open doors and communicate. THE SILENCE is a huge film which, like some books, can be enjoyed again and again. In my opinion, one of the most beautiful films ever made and one of my most intense experiences in a theatre, ever. Masterpiece.

The fourth DVD presents an indispensable documentary about Ingmar Bergman shot by the Swedish director Vilgot Sjman.

This happened not once but several times during the opera.  It was so annoying and distracting that it killed my enthusiasm for this rendition of The Magic Flute!

1899361,4,B0000A02TX,"These three films from the early sixties have often been characterized as Bergman's religious trilogy.  In a somewhat enigmatic introduction to the published screenplays, Bergman stated that the films deal with reduction.  ""Through a Glass Darkly - conquered certainty, Winter Light - penetrated certainty.  The Silence - God's silence - the negative imprint.  Therefore, they constitute a trilogy.""

Well, maybe.  While there are some unifying elements, such as the music of Bach, Christian religious imagery, and the reuse of certain actors, these films explore many issues other than man's search for a God who has disappeared.  In fact, even though Bergman felt that he had to clear away the underbrush of his religious upbringing to see human nature more clearly, it's not his connection to the harsh Lutheran god that oppresses him, but his relationship with a harsh Lutheran pastor father.  His spiritual doubts are about the possibility of true human connection.  The attempts to make this connection, and the failure to do so, constitute the true thematic thread here.

In Through a Glass Darkly, we watch Karin (Harriet Andersson) sink into schizophrenia while her husband Martin (Max Von Sydow), brother Minus and father David (Gunnar Bjornstrand) look on helplessly.  We find out that David, a writer, has been secretly observing his daughter's madness in order to use it in his next novel.  Harriet discovers this and tells Martin, who verbally flays his father-in-law.  In a great line, Martin says to David, ""Your faith and doubt carry no weight.  All that's apparent is your ingenuity.""  This seems to be Bergman dismissing his own attempts to grapple with the religious dimension of life through his movies.  Religion is actually not a big part of this movie's plot.  Karin is the only person who sees and wants to get close to God, and she's literally mad.  Her psychologist husband Martin represents a bloodless humanism, Minus a kind of callow intellectualism.  At the end of the movie, Minus asks his father about God and David says that God is love of other people - this delivered by the most self-absorbed, emotionally isolated character in the movie.  Bergman has thought himself into a corner here, and, despite the strong performances by Andersson and Bjorkstrand, what results is a facile display of spiritual nihilism played out in a summer cottage by the edge of the Baltic.

Winter Light explores religious faith more directly.  Gunnar Bjornstrand is Tomas, a pastor who has lost his connection to God: he literally can't ""hear"" him any more.  Over the course of three hours (12 to 3) on a gray Sunday afternoon, Tomas fails to save the soul of a despondent fisherman who needs answers to stave off his mushrooming despair, and confronts the anger and frustration of his former mistress, Marta (played by Bergman regular Ingrid Thulin).  Tomas both needs her and is repulsed by his own need.  Marta understands (and Bergman wants us to understand) that Tomas' inability to give over to human love is directly connected to his inability to experience divine love.  At the end, Tomas is preaching to a church empty of any parishioners. Only Marta is there to hear him, but he insists on doing the service anyway.  Here Bergman is on firmer and more optimistic intellectual ground.  What's important is human striving, and it's only in the striving that we have a chance of discovering our true purpose in the world.  Told with a masterful economy of words and images, and featuring a magnificent performance by Bjornstrand, Winter Light is one of Bergman's strongest films.

The Silence gained notoriety not for its bleak tale of two sisters trapped in a deserted hotel in an unnamed country, but for a couple of fairly gratuitous sex scenes that were lurid for 1963.  Gunnel Lindblom is Anna, the younger sister.  Anna is all physicality and carnal need; she sweats, paces, bathes, has sex with strange men.  Her sister Ester (Ingrid Thulin) is her opposite, a sickly translator. Ester's illness has forced them to stop in this unsettling foreign country where tanks clank through streets whose names the sisters can't decipher.  Ester smokes, reads, types, masturbates, takes to her bed with a mysterious respiratory malady.  Anna's young son Johan is with them, and it's Johan's innocent perceptions that provide some warmth to the schematic struggle between the two women.  God isn't mentioned here, and seems completely absent.  What's left is the human need for connection and our inability to connect across the abyss of our separate natures.  Ester's one spark of emotional warmth comes when she and the foreign hotel waiter both recognize that the music on the radio is Bach, and speak his name in their respective languages.  Art, predatory and ""weightless"" in Through a Glass Darkly, is here the hope of communication across cultures.

Bergman's intellect took him to bleak, life-denying places that he had to feel his way out of.  The visceral aspects of theater and film - sets, lighting, music, voices and especially faces - grounded his struggles to understand how humans can function is a world where God's silence is deafening and they can't fathom the promptings of their own beating hearts.  His refusal to abandon the emotional path to truth even as his intellect was trying to undercut it puts tension and passion in his work, and keeps it fresh almost half a century later.

Criterion does an excellent job with the packaging and film transfer for these three films.  Peter Cowie supplies an enlightening commentary.  Another extra is a documentary by Vilgot Sjoman on the making of Winter Light.",1143936000,15,5647,5.031216361679225
1899372,5,B0000A02TX,"Through a Glass Darkly

The first theme of the film is the isolation of the individual in the world, and the individual's communion with his fellow human beings. The second theme, resulting no doubt from the strict Lutheran upbringing of Bergman that caused him so much pain and anguish, is the Christian notion, and also a modern idea, that only a broken spirit can find a new life. According to this thought, each of the characters in the film must first go to their ruin before being ""reborn."" In the cases of David and Minus, they found their salvations through the concept of ""God is Love,"" which Bergman will debunk in his next film. Nothing is said about Martin, and Karin by choosing, in spite of herself, the spider-God, is obviously not redeemed.

All four characters in the film are alone within themselves, insulated from the outside world. David, the father, has taken refuge and isolated himself through his writing, to the exclusion of his now-deceased wife and then his children. He could not be more explicit than when he confesses to Karin: ""One draws a magic circle around oneself ... Every time life smashes the circle ... one draws a new circle, builds up new barriers."" Tragically, he is well aware of his isolation and suffers immensely from it, as Bergman shows us symbolically, through a long shot. In this shot, David, who has gone his room under the pretence of getting his pipe tobacco, is seen his arms extended, staring into space, as a Christ-like figure, reaching out into the empty air.

Martin's communication with his wife is mannered and superficial. He is locked up in his role as a ""good"" husband. Although he loves Karin, he is too busy with his work and his everyday life to be able to understand, and therefore help, his sick wife. He only goes through the motions of caring for Karin, like David's ""caring"" for his children when he brings them ill-chosen gifts.

Karin lives equally between her two worlds. The first world, the world of her schizophrenia where she hears voices, is of course totally incomprehensible to others. This world, at odds with her second world, the world of realities, results in her being also misunderstood. Out of desperation, she will eventually choose her schizophrenic world. Karin is the only one of the four characters looking for God. Is it only because she is weak and needs help? If this is so, this selfish relationship with God only serves to save and heal herself. This theme will be explored in Winter Light, Bergman's next film.

Minus also lives in his own world, tormented by his awakening sexuality, which leads to his ambiguous attraction to his sister, the only female with whom he has any form of intimacy. He has no male guidance, as his father has abandoned him. He cannot handle the difficult transition from puberty to adulthood and has locked himself out to the realties of the outside world. His mixed-up feelings, aided by his sister's mental problems, lead him to commit incest.

Regardless, the film shows that in some instances hope is still possible, and these barriers can be broken down. We see David undergoing a transformation following his attempted suicide, opening up to his children and to Martin with love. By the end of the film, as he encourages Minus to face the future, he offers his son a real gift, his simple belief that ""God is love, and love is God."" Minus has confronted his fear of love, but he is too ashamed of his ""sin"" to comprehend his action's power of redemption, until his father explains it to him. David asserts that every sort of love proves God's presence: ""The highest and the lowest, the most absurd and the most sublime. All kinds of love ... Suddenly the emptiness turns into abundance, and despair into life. It's like a reprieve, Minus, from sentence of death."" This is an implicitly Christian message. When Minus finally says, ""Papa spoke to me,"" it's like an absolution from the lost father he has regained, along with his belief in God.
I believe it would be a mistake to assume that Through a Glass Darkly is Karin's film. Only Karin's slide into madness is central to the film, as it forces her father, brother and husband to confront themselves: their experiences, not her illness, shape the film. And of the four characters, Minus is the pivotal figure of the film: it is his consciousness that organizes the film. His struggle, with the coming of adulthood and his desire to create a bond with his father, is the major story of the film.

Winter Light

Winter Light is the most unequivocally religious of all Bergman's films. It deals with the God-Man relationship, but also with human relationships in terms of the divine. The basic theme of the film is the failure of everything to communicate with everything else: God with humans, and humans with humans. It is what Tomas describes as ""God's silence."" From the beginning, Bergman had been somewhat dissatisfied with the ""security-God"" who popped up at the end of his previous film, Through a Glass Darkly, and felt the need to correct it. In the film that followed, he intended to repudiate David's ""God is Love"" as he answers his son Minus's fear and uncertainty. The ""love"" in ""God is Love,"" implies communication, and since communication between God and Man does not exist, that statement cannot be true.

The first fifteen minutes of the film, a religious service officiated by Tomas, underscore the human disconnection, through the image of eight people widely scattered throughout the church pews. Tomas's first words, ""Our Lord Jesus Christ in the night when he was betrayed,"" points toward what he feels is his own betrayal by Life. Following the communion at the altar, the communicants' demeanors, except for Frovik's, leaves no doubt as to the utter failure of the liturgical act to communicate with the tiny, detached congregation.

Following the service, Tomas meets his first challenge in the person of Jonas. Tomas is totally unable to connect with Jonas's torment, and therefore to be of any solace to him. He hopes for a second chance when Jonas returns to meet him face to face, but again fails miserably at soothing Jonas's anguish. It is as if Tomas is trying to heal himself, rather than Jonas. Tomas talks about his disintegrating faith. The god of his beliefs is ""an improbable and private image of a fatherly god. Picture my prayers to an echo-God."" When Tomas held up his God to the lens of reality, his God ""turned into something ugly and revolting. A spider-God."" Tomas concludes that God does not exist: ""There is no Creator."" Tomas is stunned by his own revelation and loss. The room is suddenly filled with sunlight, underscoring this revelation. He utters Christ's last words on the cross, ""God, why have you forsaken me?"" He rushes out into the chancel, falls to the floor in a paroxysm of coughing, mumbling, ""Now, I am free...free at last."" His body is sick and so is his soul, as he now finds himself alone. However, he soon reverts to his echo-God upon hearing the bad news from the old lady. It is also Bergman's conclusion, according to which one must do one's duty, even if one feels it meaningless.

Tomas's encounter with death by the river rapids only reinforces his feelings of emptiness. The roaring of the river covering the speech and overwhelming the human presence, shows Nature's indifference to Man. This directly contradicts Tomas's pronouncements to Jonas that when God is taken out of the human consciousness, ""life becomes something understandable"" and death just"" a dissolution of body and soul.""

Tomas's second challenge comes in the form of Marta's letter. Tomas's relationship with Marta is also a failure. Tomas had married a woman who, like his mother, protected him from everything evil and ugly in the world. After she died, Tomas took up with Marta, who, probably not coincidently, physically resembles his deceased wife. When Tomas, alone in the vestry, takes out pictures of his dead wife, we see that he holds pictures of Ingrid Thulin, and they are stamped ""rakopia"" (i.e. ""proofs,"" or literally ""raw copy""). However, Marta does not behave as the protection-wife, and his obsession with his memory of his dead wife prevents him from connecting, or opening himself to Marta's love for him. Tomas reads Marta's letter, but he still has not understood her. She is simply smothering him with her demands, as he so ""eloquently"" will tell her later at the schoolhouse.

Marta herself is also incapable of real communication with Tomas. She resorts to writing a letter to him, trying to explain herself, her feelings and her love for him, rather than speak to him directly. In her letter, she displays a self-assurance and aggressiveness that she is unable to project in Tomas's physical presence. Marta is a self-declared atheist. She tells Tomas unequivocally, ""God has not spoken because God does not exist."" But it would seem that she has a connection to God in spite of herself. Having been born and raised in a joy-filled non-Christian home, she is perplexed by Tomas's neurotic, narcissistic relationship with God, and by his ""indifference to the gospels and Jesus Christ,"" which is the main part of the Christian religion that she understands (for viewers to get this point, Bergman has Marta wearing stigmata for a while). She ends her letter with, ""I love you and I live for you. Take me and use me...I have only one wish: to live for somebody,"" which is of course the true Christian creed.

Frovik, on the other hand, has no need for God to talk to him. He knows through his faith that God is present. Frovik is able to connect with love to others, as he shows in his exposition of the Passion of Christ. He understands that Christ's suffering was not so much physical, as it was psychological. Christ's mental agony was being misunderstood by his disciples, and later on denied by them. ""Yet this was not the worst. When Jesus...cried out, 'God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' He thought his heavenly father had abandoned him...in the moment before he died...Surely that must have been his greatest hardship? I mean God's silence."" This is the same ""God's silence"" that Jonas has been experiencing.

Through Blom's sarcastic remarks at the end of the film as he quotes Tomas's leitmotif, ""God is love and love is God. Love proves the existence of God,"" Bergman underscores precisely which certainty, the one achieved in Through a Glass Darkly, he wanted to expose as false in Winter Light: the identification of love with God.

The Silence

Ingmar Bergman's The Silence is arguably the most abstract and nihilistic film of the trilogy. The silence in this film goes beyond God's silence of Winter Light: it is now absolute silence, including the complete cessation of communication between human beings. The atmosphere is claustrophobic and suffocating. The film has for its setting Timoka, a strange city, in a strange land on the verge of a war. War is by definition the end result of total, absolute breakdown in communication. The war setting also symbolizes the feelings of antagonism, separation, and fear which engulf the two sisters. The language of this country is totally incomprehensible to the three travelers, even to Ester who is by profession an interpreter familiar with linguistics. Although it is reported that Bergman fell on the word ""Timoka"" (""pertaining to the executioner"" in the Estonian language) by accident, the other identifiable foreign word in the film, ""kasi"" (hand), is Estonian, a Finno-Ugric language. Estonian is not related to the Indo-European family of languages, but has direct links to Sanskrit. As such, Bergman probably could not have found a more remote language from Swedish.

The communication breakdown in the film is universal. The three travelers can scarcely communicate their basic needs to the porter, and they must resort to hand gestures, grunts, etc, to express themselves. Attempts at communication between the two sisters are merely lacerating verbal jousts. The mother and son are worlds apart. Johan is repeatedly left to himself, as his mother goes about her business of arguing with her sister or fornicating with her lover. Anna and her lover cannot communicate except in a physical way, which Anna finds convenient. ""How nice it is we don't understand each other.""

The characters of the sisters could not be more dissimilar. They are the opposing elements of a single psyche. Anna is sensual and instinctive. Ester is an intellectual, afraid of her instincts, and pathologically driven by a need to control. She loves her sister, and feels responsible for her, yet needs to control her, as their father once controlled her [Ester] with his love. But Ester is also unable to express this love, which can be misconstrued at time as incestuous, to Anna. Anna loves Ester, but is unable to effectively express her feelings to her. She is overwhelmed by Ester's need to control and restrain her. Regarding Anna's attitude toward her son, she is at once caring and rejecting. Obviously, these mixed signals from his mother are both disturbing and overwhelming to Johan. She is the closest human being in his life and she is unable to communicate unambiguously her feelings to him. Clinging desperately to his mother, he is rejected and forced into the ""real"" strange and bewildering adult world. The only incident where Johan feels somewhat unthreatened is when he is accepted in the company of the dwarfs. The dwarfs are adults, but they are Johan's size, so he feels at ease with them as he would with children of his own age. Otherwise, Johan is an outside observer of the world around him.

The old floor porter is also struggling to communicate with his guests. He shows his genuine concern for Ester's welfare, but he is still powerless in establishing a real communication. With Johan he also fails, because of the language barrier, because of the age gap, and maybe because his friendliness is instinctively misunderstood by Johan (and I am sure by many viewers).

There is a brief moment of communion between the protagonists provided by few bars of one of the Goldberg Variations (the 25th). They are heard on Ester's radio and result in an instant communication between Ester and the old porter, but also with every one else present, as we see through the large doorway a ""Pieta:"" Johan is on Anna's lap being caressed and kissed. The old man pronounces the name of the composer ""Johan Sebastian Bach,"" with a stress on the name ""Johan,"" implying everyone's connection with and through the young boy.
God has totally disappeared from the scene. After a prolonged, suffocating attack, Ester implores God to allow her to die in her own homeland. But God is silent and she is left to die alone and abandoned in a strange land.

Although a rather depressing film, The Silence nevertheless ends on a hopeful note: Ester and Johan have been able to communicate with each other. Before leaving, Johan hugs his aunt, in the only display of love in the film, and Ester is able to translate few words from the strange language of Timoka into Swedish, which she passes on to Johan.

Notwithstanding his other masterpieces, these three films, Through a Glass Darkly, Winter Light, and The Silence, represents the best that Ingmar Bergman has ever produced.",1141344000,8,15291,4.879476318829418
1899373,5,B0000A02TX,"There are good summaries and critiques of this trilogy (and the fourth DVD documentary) that I won't simply repeat what other people have written.  I agree with almost every review here. I saw these films many years ago and only recently have I viewed them again on DVD.  To me this trilogy is the centerpiece of Bergman's films.  I can see Bergman's artistic trajectory leading up to ""Through a Glass Darkly"" and where his films would go beyond ""The Silence.""  The heart of this series, Winter Light, was actually the film I liked least until I saw it again last week...and finally understood it.  My two cents is simply that Bergman was in search of much more than his issues with religion.  I believe that this film trilogy does not separate the ""religious"" issues from ""psychological/familial/secular"" issues that many critics claim is so.  This trilogy to me is not the point where Bergman went from religion to humanism.  The Silence and Through a Glass Darkly are not different.  They both both question sources of meaning and sources of inspiration.  They both illustrate stuggles of individuals who seek meanings to their lives.  They both deal consequences.  Darkly concentrates on the horror of the woman who is the witness to the revelation of meaning and God, while Silence shows us the innocent boy who, quite unaware, embodies the love of God that the adult world around him has failed to embrace.  Winter Light is the core, the film that I believe is not only the heart of the trilogy but also a film that one can use to translate any of Bergman's films and ideas.  Where a priest is a failed craftsman/artist who cannot inspire with his art/preaching of God because he feels abandoned by what he stands for.  The woman who loves him is a teacher who cannot teach.  She fails to instruct him that she loves him and is painfully aware of her awkward and mute efforts.  Even her letter to him is monologue, not conversation.

  Secular and Spiritual aspects of people are side-by-side with Bergman.  I feel it is one of his greatest frustrations that many have separated these issues in his films as being issues apart from each other.  They are entwined seamlessly.

I too was convinced that Bergman's ""religious"" films and his ""secular/psychological/familial"" films were different paths of a great film maker and that they were related only in intensity.  Let me correct myself now.  They are the same.  Bergman was thinking outside of the artistic cinematic and personal spiritual box by merging them as a grand understanding of what humanity is.  In that sense, these films are not depressing or bleak.  They are almost the opposite to me.  I feel elated and intelligent when watching them because I do not feel lectured, dazzled, or talked down to.

Yeah, I'm the reviewer that had problems with The Seventh Seal.  I'll have to pull that one out again.  Apparently Bergman used a different cinematographer for the Trilogy.  It is very austere, barely furnished rooms, walls with lose plaster, and the sea, the rocks in black and white, all to emphasize the nature of spirituality. The Seventh Seal was far more dramatic, splashing blacks against the grim reaper and the knight.  I know the Swedes are known for austerity, but this Glass Darkly is The Wasteland. There are only the four characters, a Bachian cello for a score, and the barren coast of an island somewhere on the North Sea.

Harriet Andersson had me convinced that God was a spider in a closet.  What a spectacular bit of acting, nerve wracking really. Young Lars Passgard is the greatest sixteen-year-old actor of all time.  Max von Sydow is the quintessential stoic Swede in love with a burden.  And finally, the Bergman stalking horse we find in many of his films, the novelist played by Gunnar Bjornstrand has picked the bones of all, including his ill daughter, for fiction characters and themes. He is not forgiven easily for this discovered transgression.

How can God, if there is a God, let us down, or test us so cruelly.  That's the theme; Bergman unlike so many that try to explain the meaning of life, (Saul Bellow comes to mind) Bergman actually delivers.",1134345600,2,1434,4.741935483870968
1899375,4,B0000A02TX,"A Criterion Collection DVD set with three of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's early-1960's films, which have come to be known as his, ""Trilogy Of Faith"", in that all three films question and philosophize the existence of God. Each features a striking sharp and brisk black and white photography conveying isolation in the midst of familiarity, and desperation in the course of change.

1963's ""The Silence"", the strongest and most ambitious film here, has a notorious history of being the first general public theatrical film to feature graphic pornographic images. The buzz of frank adult sexual content on the big screen made it a box-office success in the United States, one of the few global movie markets to neither ban nor censor the film. Look for waves of an inspired Stanley Kubrick's work in ""The Shining"", in the story of two adult sisters and a child who interrupt a train ride to take residence in an old Gothic and spacious European hotel in a mid-urban city. Bergman experiences with a hand-held camera for the first time as the sisters reveal an impenetrable wall of distance from each other. One is sickly, the other looks for excitement and sexual companionship in a city that offers their own isolation back to them on a silver platter. The child meanwhile, exuberant with innocence, explores the mostly vacant hotel, amuses himself with a cap gun, and strikes up a friendship with a troupe of David Lynchian travelling acrobatic dwarves. Bergman severs the familial tie that bonds in a closing sequence aboard the train with two of the characters returning to lives we never learn much about, while the third remains, as if trapped in the dying hotel. As Bergman is, the film is dream-like yet mundane, with a morale concerning the distance we insist upon one another.

Bergman himself is prone to inspiration and 1961's ""Through A Glass Darkly"", is reminiscent to, of all things, Tennessee William's ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", in it's depiction of a tragic and possibly mentally unbalanced heroine. Four family members converge to a seaside home for a holiday weekend and again, the familial bonds shred as one resorts to mentally unhinged behavior as the others seem to helplessly encourage her psychological breakdown. Suggestions of childhood rape, and incest, and unsettling victimized pathos like the character Blanche in ""Streetcar"", make this a grim profile of degradation amidst the support and misplaced love of family. Here Bergman leaves you helpless, pining for release from the mental trappings of a troubled past.

1962's ""Winter Light"", is more stark and impersonal than the other films, creating a cold detached godless universe in the story of a priest (Gunnar Bjornstrand, who also stars in ""Through A Glass Darkly""), losing faith and questioning the worth of his own life. Like cold water through frozen plumbing, the film trickles it's spotty information, long time frames, and deadening snowy images, as if it's slowly breathing pace will simply cease at any moment. It's Bergman at his most stoic.

The DVD set includes a documentary on the making of ""Winter Light"". In Swedish with English subtitles.",1126310400,,3146,5.079303675048356
1899376,5,B0000A02TX,"I knew from the first few shots of 'Through a Glass Darkly' that my money had been well spent - Sven Nykvist's cinematography has no comparison. As for the subject matter - this is very deep stuff. The existence or nonexistence of god, a major Bergman theme, is taken up again, but never so quietly effective as these three rather disquieting films. 'Winter Light' is probably my favorite of the three movies - it feels more direct and personal than the other two movies. 'The Silence', as many have said, is one of Bergman's most difficult movies - it is indeed quite unnerving and at times very different from any other Bergman movie. I feel very challenged by this movie, and yet unable to deny its power - the film, perhaps, has its own foreign language that needs to be solved like a puzzle.",1122768000,,796,4.534722222222222
1899377,5,B0000A02TX,"As with Beckett's trilogy of novels _Molloy, Malone Dies and The Unnamable_ this trilogy of novels seems to imitate Baroque music in its structure--at the time, through Bergman's marriage with Kabi Laretei (sorry if this is misspelled), Bergman became even more interested in Baroque music, especially the music of Bach. Bach was a master of chamber music--that is, music with few musicians that give the viewer/listener a sense of intimacy. And the trilogy seems to have, in its three films, the three movements of a traditional chamber concerto. And Bach's music figures prominently in at least two of the films--in the first, with the soundtrack lifted from Bach, and in the last, with one of the few moments of communication centered around Bach's music. (I am not sure if the organ music in the second film is also Bach; it seems a reasonable hypothesis.) The trilogy represents a cinematic break for Bergman from the large, intricate productions exemplified by _Wild Strawberries_ and _The Seventh Seal_.
But the trilogy seems to represent a transition for Bergman from problems of theology to those immediate problems people experience. This is the reason for the necessity of cinematic intimacy--to be close to these people's problems, one must first be close to the people represented.
I have attempted, here, to avoid obscurities. The interpretation of such details has gone on apace, as with all Bergman's films. But these obscurities are often not too dificult to understand, as Bergman often uses the same themes of religion and despair in all his films. The point is that these three brilliant films represent a complete change in structure and technique for Bergman--he even began, here, to use more radical cinematic methods (an example is the revolutionary six minute close up on Ingrid Thulin's character in the misnomered _Winter Light_). The importance of these films from an historical standpoint is their evidence of a paradigm shift for Bergman, as discussed above. That, and their thematic genius.",1081814400,5,2021,5.18348623853211
1899378,5,B0000A02TX,"A Film Trilogy by Ingmar Bergman probably considered one of the best cinematic trilogies ever, if not the films alone are considered to be some of the best film ever made.  Criterion gives this trilogy an appropriate treatment as they release all three films together with a documentary.
Through a Glass Darkly is the first installment of Bergman's Trilogy that takes place on an island off the coast of Sweden where a family is having a vacation at their summer home.  The father, David (Gunnar Bjrnstrand), has recently returned from one of his many trips and his closest family is present.  His family consists of his daughter Karin (Harriet Andersson), who is struggling with a mental illness that is gradually getting worse, his son Fredrik (Lars Passgrd) who is in the middle of his scholarly diversion, and Martin (Max von Sydow) who is Karin's husband and a medical doctor.  As the siblings rediscover the family home, they recall blissful moments from their childhood, however, the happiness brings back a strong sense of melancholy that threads their memories.  These depressing memories of an absent father and his shortcomings as a care-giver have resulted in deep scars in the sibling's psyche. Reminiscence of their agonizing past affects Karin's mental health as it is deteriorating at a much faster pace, which brings the family members regret and grief.  This then causes anguish among all the present family members as they are all affected by Karin in one way or another.  Through a Glass Darkly is the beginning of a trilogy where grief and pain commence, which will be followed by Winter Light and Silence.  Bergman demonstrates a thorough understanding of the human consciousness as he directs Through a Glass Darkly where he dissects the social structure of a family and its affects on its members.  This results in an outmost brilliant cinematic experience.
Winter Light is the second film after Through a Glass Darkly.  Pastor Ericsson (Gunnar Bjrnstrand) is suffering an enduring cold and he must hold mass for an ever-shrinking congregation as he is facing a spiritual crisis of his own.  After the mass, Pastor Ericsson attempts to withdraw due to his cold, but is confronted by Jonas Persson's wife.  It appears that Jonas (Max von Sydow) is suffering from severe anxiety and depression.  However, Pastor Ericsson is inept in helping Jonas's emotional distress and instead addresses his own divine doubts about God.  The pastor is also pondering his current affair with Mrta (Ingrid Thulin) that he is thinking of ending, but Mrta insists that they should continue to see each other.  As a result, Pastor Ericsson is meditatively squeezed in between God and Mrta as he has difficulty deciding on what he wants.  He desires Mrta's love as he knows it offers him comfort on a daily basis, but it goes against his ideal perspective of how to serve as a minister.  Winter Light is not as grandiose as Bergman's earlier films (e.g., Naked Night and Seventh Seal).  It is apparent that he has taken a new path as he is directing this film in a much smaller milieu.  The setting is a personal place where catharsis is permitted without interruptions as Pastor Ericsson is facing his own demons.  Winter Light serves as an enlightening and purgative link between Through a Glass Darkly and Silence.  In the end, Winter Light offers an ultimate cinematic experience for self-reflection as it opens doors where questions must be asked.
Silence is the third film after the succession of Through a Glass Darkly and Winter Light.  The sisters, Ester (Ingrid Thulin) and Anna (Gunnel Lindblom), are stranded in a foreign city with Anna's son, Johan.  Ester is a neurotic over-achiever that often attempts to look at the rationality of things and Anna is a careless thrill-seeker that acts on her impulses.  The two of them have unresolved issues that reach as far back as their childhood which have left them in an emotional turmoil.  These issues cloud their judgment on how to approach each other as if they were lost within the emotional confusion caused by these issues.  This confusion is left in a vacuum where their bitterness is growing in silence.  Johan is placed in the middle of this silence as a compassionate shadow between the sisters, which encourages them to maintain a civil harmony.  The sisters' only hope for healing is the innocence of Johan's curiosity which is untouched by the worldly cynicism that controls most of the sisters beliefs and values.  Johan's innocence is full of acceptance, understanding, life, and love, which is something that Ester and Anna have difficulty in sharing.  In addition, the silence between them sets their minds and thoughts pessimistically adrift and is elevated through their personal cynicism.  Silence uses cinematography that is unmatched as it enhances emotional turmoil that the sisters are experiencing through the use of provoking camera angles, close-ups, and pans.  In addition, the frequent play with light and shadows boosts emotional situations of the characters and enhances how they are perceived by the audience.  The lack of sound enhances moments when sound is utilized.  Overall, Bergman has manipulated elements of cinema in Silence to perfection as he leaves a brilliant cinematic experience for the audience.
These three films are perfectly summed up with the fourth film, which serves as a documentary for the Trilogy, by Vilgot Sjman (I Am Curious Yellow and I Am Curious Blue) who served as intern during the 50s for Bergman.
In the end, I appreciate these films as they develops an understanding of why Bergman belongs with the cinematic geniuses of all time such as Antonioni, Chaplin, Clouzot, Fassbinder, Fellini, Godard, Kiarostami, Kieslowski, Kurosawa, Lang, Powell, Pressburger, Renoir, Truffaut and many others.",1075939200,10,5818,5.070304302203568
1899379,5,B0000A02TX,"The three films in this box set represent some of the best of Ingmar Bergman's work in the 'chamber drama' format. As the director's interest in classical music grew, the art house scene saw more and more films from Bergman with just a few characters interacting within one location, like the instruments in a string quartet. In __Through a Glass Darkly__, __Winterlight (aka __The Communicants__), and __The Silence__, Bergman exorcises the spiritual demons of his childhood within a very modern, every-day context. The themes that he deals with are the same ones which drove such classics as __The Seventh Seal__ and __Wild Strawberries__; however, while such movies were theatrical and featured archetypical characters, the films in the trilogy (and most of Bergman's subsequent works) are realistic and feature psychologically nuanced and complex characters.
In __Through a Glass Darkly__, a vacationing family is forced to deal with its own disintegration. The daughter, Karin, played masterfully by Harriet Anderson, battles schizophrenia and attempts in vein to stay in touch with consensual reality, while her father David, played by the stoic Gunner Bjornstrand finds himself unable to resist the urge to use her illness as a means to drive his artistic and intellectual work as a novelist. Max von Sydow plays Karin's loving and simple husband, while her brother, Minus, played by Lars Pasgard, comes to represent the anxieties and insecurities of the family's next generation. This is a difficult film to watch. Emotionally, it is overwhelming (though Bergman never strays too far from his characteristic subtlety).
The next offering in the trilogy is __Winterlight__. Here Gunner Bjorstrand plays Tomas, a mid-aged priest, whose own crisis of fate fails to save a parishioner in his church from committing suicide at the thought of nuclear holocaust. Meanwhile, in a superb performance, Ingrid Thulin plays Tomas's mistress, an atheist who attempts to save him from his own spiritual and personal failings.
Finally, __The Silence__ is the controversial third move in the trilogy. While traveling through a mysterious foreign country, two sisters, the intellectual Ester (Ingrid Thulin) and the sensual Anna (Gunnel Lindblom), and Anna's 10-year-old son, are forced to stay in an almost abandoned hotel. Sexual tension rises as Ester and Anna (presumably intimate) cannot come to terms with their own diverging desires. Anna's son Johan, played by Jorgen Lindstrom, must discover the hotel, while attempting to understand the uncertainty of the world around him.
I will not go into the deeper symbolic structures of each film and allow viewers to discover for themselves. __The Silence__, the most bleak AND most optimistic film in the trilogy, is my favorite, though __Winterlight__ will probably compel more viewers.
The era of Bergman's auteurism is gone. Just as Antonioni, Dreyer, and other masters of high modernist cinema have lost their once immense popularity in the American and European art house scene, so have Bergman and the 'Bergmanesque' been long in decline. However, it is definitely a good idea to view these films. Even if the singular existential angst portrayed by Bergman is no longer the anxiety of the postmodern era, Bergman's technical abilities and his skills in drawing incredible perfomances from his troupe of actors are a wonder to behold.
Each DVD contains a short discussion with film scholar Peter Cowie. Also included is __Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie__ on a separate disk. Bergman fans will enjoy more than two hours of interviews and behind-the-scenes footage from the making of __Winterlight__. The box set contains just the right amount of extras. It is packaged elegantly and is a great buy.",1075507200,38,3743,5.324324324324325
1899380,5,B0000A02TX,"Of late, I have developed an interest in Bergman movies.  I can't seem to get myself away from them, as the ""artfullness"" of Bergman's movies transcend time and even Bergman's weightly ""popularity"".  When he was allowed to pursue his ""art"" by being given the  ""poetic license"" of his popularity i.e. he could write, direct, attract stars that he wanted, I feel he produced what one would hope, all he was capable of as an artist.
 Yes, this sounds grandiose on my part to give such an uninhibited glowing review of what would seem to be such stark movies.  But folks, these DVD's are worth it, because the viewer is given the opportunity to see the behind the scenes making of the movies, and more than a peek at Bergman himself.  Bergman appears to be an artist  not afraid to look at himself beyond the curse of  Narcissus.  What he was able to see and show through these movies is remarkable.
I bought these DVD's with some trepidation, thinking that I may be pursuing my interest to nurture my proclivity to wallow in depressive affect or worse to try to in my older middle aged years imbibe as much art as I can tolerate as the trash that is produced and maketed by the media is exponential.  I'm afraid to say that much of the ""art"" sits on my bookshelves or in a pile here or there, gleaned once and put away for another time.  I could not do that with these movies, or any other Bergman DVD's that I have watched.  I bring up the DVD issue, as the VCR versions are nice, but do not offer the ""extras"" of the DVD's i.e. interviews with Bergman, etc.  I have VCR versions of some of his movies, but will buy DVD as well of some of them i.e. Persona when they are available.

7994730,5,B0000A02TX,"This is a good collection of 3 very different Bergman films with 3 different styles. My favorite of the 3 here is thew silence just due to the more artsy approach.
These 3 films seem to be dealing with philosophical questions in relation to Gods silence as well as the nature of what God is. This trilogy is often called the atheist trilogy.
Winter light deals with questions about the nature of an omnipotent being such as the common Catholic example due to the God of that religion being an all loving father type of being.
Through a Glass Darkly deals with mental illness and accountability for an illness that changes a persons character. I enjoy the argument in Glass the best but Silence is my fav because is has that Persona/The Rite/Hr of Wolf/Passion of Anna feel to it as opposed to the Seventh Seal or the Magician style.
As a philosophy grad each of these films would be great for a discussion style class.
Even though as a whole The Silence is my fav, Winter Light has the best acting and it is great to watch the making of doc to see how amazingly professional Bergman was at work I always think of Bergman as more of a playwright. You can see i the doc included the amazing chemistry between Gunner as well as other regular Bergman actor/actresses.
Winter Light is the heaviest and prob technically the best but i just love The Silence. Not to leave out Glass which has great performances by several regulars such as Max Sydnow.
Ingrid Thulin's performance in the Silence is great as well as her role in Winter Light. I have always thought Thulin was the most intense of all Bergman actresses and 2 good examples are 1. The Silence 2. The Rite
