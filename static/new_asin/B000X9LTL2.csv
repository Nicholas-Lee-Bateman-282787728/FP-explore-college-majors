2999470,1,B000X9LTL2,"I rented this movie with the expectation of learning something new about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his most famous creation, Sherlock Holmes.

I was bored after the first ten minutes of the film. I continued to watch it later, became bored again and paused it. This kept happening over the course of the film for me. At no time did this film grab my attention and hold onto it.

The soundtrack of this film varied between different genre of music, from instrumental, to classical to a type of modern rock. No consistency whatsoever.

Likewise, the visuals of the film seemed disjointed. For example, there was a scene, repeated several times throughout the movie, of a group of phantom children playing in a room. A man comes in, not seeing the children playing in front of him, who stands in front of a fireplace and lights a pipe. I waited for an explanation of this scene and why it was repeated several time through the film, but none came. It seemed to just be there for no reason. There were other scenes in the film which seemed to have no purpose and I was left wondering what they were about. One particularly annoying scene was near the end of the film, where some one is holding a copy of a Sherlock Holmes book and is flipping backwards through the book. Again, another scene that was there for no apparent reason.

The whole film consists of the narrator speaking. No one is interviewed by the narrator, so all you hear is his voice, along with some recordings of an interview Doyle did some years before his death. Nothing special about them and they add nothing to the film.

From what I gathered, the film is supposed to be an expose of Doyle's personal beliefs about the supernatural. His links to the Theosophists and Freemasons are continously mentioned. The identities of other acquaintances of Doyle's, who were also members of those groups is likewise brought-up, as if being a Freemason or Theosophist is some sort of black mark against these people. Early on in the film, the Jesuits are painted as if they were some sort of diabolical agency, instead of a religious order. We can freely disagree with the beliefs of others, but I personally don't hold Doyle in any lower regard due to his own ties to these people and organizations. Further, Doyle's gullibility in believing in fairies is mentioned at length. Anyone who has read a biography of Doyle's life would already have known this.

So, Doyle was a spiritualist, a freemason and believed in things that most people today consider strange. So what? Anyone who knows anything about famous authors would realize that odd behavior and beliefs are often part and parcel of the very talented. Edgar Allen Poe, Hunter S. Thompson, Truman Capote and many others had aspects of their personalities that most other people consider to be odd or even frightening. But, that did not make them any less talented. Neither does it prevent us from enjoying their works today.

Despite the Product Details Synopsis' claim that ""You will never see Sherlock Holmes in the same way again"", it didn't even begin to explore the characters of Holmes, Watson and Moriarty, in comparison to Doyle's personality, until near the very end.

For me, there was never a moment in this film where I was astounded by a new revelation. It was just a long and boring lecture about secret socieities and Doyle's involvment in them. So what? This film did not change my view of Sherlock Holmes or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the smallest way.",1194825600,12,3485,4.701639344262295
2999471,2,B000X9LTL2,"A simplistic documentary that, oddly enough, relies on psychedelic visuals and an eclectic soundtrack to carry a lesser Wikipedia article. Sorry, but by the weight of the title, I was expecting more. It wasn't all bad. The narrator's voice was smooth and consistent, and some of the information covered was interesting, such as the Cottingley Fairies, but other mediums have done it much better. My biggest gripe was the long musical interludes between the narrative. I love my music, and if used with the right visuals and context can make for a profound lasting impression. Sadly, this wasn't the case here, the music interludes were merely mechanisms to stretch this documentary to a credible length. Another problem I found was the mastering. The volume levels were all over the place.

With a series of entertaining stories as well as a successful movie starring Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, many have grown fond of the characters created by Doyle - Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The only remaining mystery was Doyle himself. This documentary unveils that mystery by thoroughly exploring his life and how his peculiar interests in secret societies as well as other conspiratorial endeavors influenced his work. While some of the scenes and music seemed a little unnecessary the photographs and narrated content were essential and informative.

2999473,4,B000X9LTL2,"I'm a fan of Philip Gardiner since he will venture where most men fear to tread.  He explores and brings to life people, places, groups, and happenings that many of us wonder about but can't find enough information on or may have never thought about before.  This documentary is no different.  I've read a lot of Sherlock Holmes books and knew that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had an ""odd"" personality and life.  Mr. Gardiner introduced loads of information I wasn't even aware of.  In this film we follow Doyle from his time at a Catholic Jesuit school and into his interest into the occult and membership into secret societies. As with all Gardiner films, the amount of investigation he does is phenomenal and he shares it all with us, from well-known facts to curious speculation.

Throughout The Madness of Sherlock Holmes we see many photos of the author and his life, which I found quite interesting in and of themselves.  Yes, Doyle was eccentric, there's no doubt about it.  When you read a Sherlock Holmes book it's like taking a walk through the author's mind, and it does seem that Holmes and Watson are really both sides of the author himself.  Like most geniuses they're also plagued by madness, and Doyle is no exception.  This film was truly fascinating!",1288483200,,1264,4.730593607305936
2999474,1,B000X9LTL2,"I'm a fan of some of Gardiner's work.  Not this!  I am so glad I did not buy it.  Not only does the movie not make any attempt to provide a concise trip through its material, but it provides it in such broken fashion that you never know where it is going or why.  Also, a large amount of the 75 minutes are nothing but unrelated pictures and music.  Seriously, the narrator will take a pause while blurry images of old lamps are shown and rock music played... then more nonsense rambling.... then more pointless, unrelated pictures of household items with piano music...

Philip majorly failed here.  Did he have something to say?  Who the heck knows.  There certainly are not any hidden messages or subtext either.  This is either a blatant attempt to make money from previously satisfied customers or evidence that Philip's opinion of his own work is not in alignment with his actual skills.  I personally believe he needs to check his compasses.",1276560000,2,948,4.650602409638554
