8366259,2,B002DY9KO8,Didn't care for this movie because it made no sense and did not have a good storyline.  You are left wondering what are they doing and what is it really about.  The only good thing about this movie is it has Olivier Martinez in it.  He's a great actor and should not be in this movie.,1360540800,2,284,4.035714285714286
8366260,4,B002DY9KO8,"This movie had me laughing, then crying. Olivier Martinez is fun to watch, and the actor who plays the young boy is charming and believable. Yves Montand didn't quite pull off the ""enigmatic forest spirit"" thing, however, and the movie does have some problematic flaws. (Why are they taking those gnome things to Grenoble?) Enjoyable over all.",1265414400,4,343,5.035087719298246
