I am amazed that with his knowledge, speed, ability, and power, that he does not have one of the largest Shorin Ryu organizations in America. If I trained in Shorin Ryu, this would be my teacher. GREAT JOB TSUNAMI, I sincerely hope you produce more videos featuring Oshiro Sensei.",1034294400,3,382,4.632352941176471
7888930,5,6305435316,"This video is of the highest quality, both in content and production value.  As a Karate teacher of 27 years experience, it is a pleasure to view such a fine video as this.  Toshihiro Oshiro is a true master, and all  serious martial artists would do well to study his technique.  He explains  things clearly, and shows how even basic techniques can be improved upon in  awesome ways.  A must have for your martial arts library.",924998400,4,428,4.552631578947368
