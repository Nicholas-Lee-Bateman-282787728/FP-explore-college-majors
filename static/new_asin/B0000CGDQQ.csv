1919255,1,B0000CGDQQ,"Our family has watched Capote's excellent color film ""A Christmas Memory,"" originally taped from a TV, for years.  This ""new"" VHS version is a black and white, low-quality, grainy version that no one who has seen the original would want to buy.  Having dealt with Amazon for years, I am shocked that they would offer such a shoddy, overpriced product for sale!",1074729600,44,360,4.790322580645161
1919256,1,B0000CGDQQ,"My husband copied this program way back when in COLOR. When I saw this offered, I figured I could give it to him as a present. Not only is this reproduction in black and white but the quality is very poor. My husband's old copy on VHS is of better quality than this.
Perhaps Amazon should stop offering it?",1073260800,33,306,4.203389830508475
1919257,1,B0000CGDQQ,"""A Christmas Memory"" (ABC 1966) and the companion piece ""The Thanksgiving Visitor"" (ABC 1967) were films by Frank and Eleanor Perry. Geraldine Page won an Emmy for each production. The films were shot in Alabama in color and have rarely been seen since the original broadcasts.
This version is a very poor quality black and white kinescope . It does not include any special material such as Stage 67 title sequence or commercials, extras which sometime distinguish a kinescope. Excellent color prints were shown on the A&E cable network in 1993. See also ""Truman Capote's Trilogy"" (1969) for a slightly edited version of ""A Christmas Memory"" and the companion book by the Perrys (1969).",1071100800,49,686,5.026315789473684
1919258,5,B0000CGDQQ,"A whole generation has missed out on this TV movie (last shown over 30 years ago) yet it is memorable.  Although set around the time of the great depression, it speaks of something that all of us, once we reach a certain age experience - a Christmas/holiday where it all came together and when the holiday is mentioned later the image explodes in our memory -this was Capote's verions of this experience and it touches the soul - my parents - well into their 80's truely enjoyed seeing and remembered this film, even after it's 30+ year hiatus.  Just wish it were on DVD",1069027200,11,570,4.471153846153846
1919259,1,B0000CGDQQ,"READ ALL THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY! This is a very poor quality B&W bootleg copy. I bought this hoping to replace our VHS copy which is frankly in better shape and is in color. Returning it ASAP. The absence of any cover art, notes, extras, etc -- all that would be forgiven if it were an excellent transfer. This is anything but that.",1482883200,3,336,4.265625
1919260,5,B0000CGDQQ,"Truman Capote's ""A Christmas Memory"" is one of my favorite Christmas stories.  This is the best video, with Truman Capote reading his own story aloud.  There is a later dramatization of this story available on Amazon, which gilds the lily with a bunch of extraneous characters and is not nearly as satisfying.  This version, to me, is the most heartfelt and wonderful.",1480896000,,368,4.903225806451613

1919263,5,B0000CGDQQ,"I had seen this little film many years ago, and simply loved it. It is narrated by Truman Capote himself, and one can hear in his voice not someone just reading copy but someone recalling a time in his life which can  never be replicated  in the future. Hence the title of ""Memory"". There are newer versions out there, but this is special . Geraldine Page is remarkable, hard to take your eyes off her, she captivates. I purchased this, because I wanted to create it as one of our traditions at Christmas. Remembering another time when things were so very different, and yet so impactful, and beautiful in their simplicity.",1454716800,,623,4.603603603603603

1919266,5,B0000CGDQQ,"If you love the book, you will LOVE this version.  It is narrated by Truman Capote himself.  And is almost verbatim from the short story - nothing extra, no bells and whistles.  Just a perfect story.  The black and white film makes it so dream-like and Geeraldine Page is EXACTLY what I imagined Sook to be like.

1919269,4,B0000CGDQQ,"It was a pleasure to watch what had always been a Holiday classic in our home many years ago.

I've taken off one point because the producers did not bother to either clean up the scratches from the old film or add closed captions.  As a  release of a 'new' version, they could have made it better.  All the same, I'm happy to have found it at all, I just wish all my family members had been able to enjoy it (with captions) as much as I did.",1449446400,,442,3.9886363636363638

I bought the black and white version, but miss the color. I'm sure the Patty Duke version is good, but the Geraldine Page version is a classic.

1919274,3,B0000CGDQQ,I always liked this movie. But I really wanted the color version of this great story. Black and white doesn't do much for me theses day. I feel all the old ones done in black and white should be redone in color so folks could really get an idea of what it was like back then.,1436745600,,275,3.9285714285714284

1919279,5,B0000CGDQQ,"What a beautiful memory. Not a huge Capote fan but this takes me back to Christmases of my rural, southeastern childhood. I did NOT appreciate how fortunate I was. Had both parents and a somewhat better lifestyle. I recall helping mother bake her fruitcakes and going out in a neighbor's pasture to cut 'our very own' red cedar Christmas tree.

Geraldine Page digs out every nuance of her character. And Capote does the voice over track.

A 1997 Patty Duke subpar remake added a mysterious uncle to the household where there was none. ...Hmmm? Trying to hide Capote's sexual orientation?",1426377600,,587,4.86

1919286,1,B0000CGDQQ,Uuuugggg I'm at a complete loss at what to do! This is a fond childhood Christmas movie. But the one I remember was a beautifully filmed color version but this is a grainy b&w. I should have known something was up when I pulled it  from the box and found this precious film in a clear plastic case that was Scotch taped shut. Crushed and broken! Without the cover. No insert at all. Not as pictured at all! The DVD itself is viewable and i watched it and really enjoyed it. I guess I'm mostly just disappointed in Amazon  cuz I kinda feel tricked. Why don't they say Black and White version...and without cover. Sorta feels like a pirated copy!? Seems beneath Amazon! So return or keep???? Frustrated!,1419033600,,701,4.46875
1919287,5,B0000CGDQQ,"Loved it! I saw it once so long ago but remembered this treasured moment in a young boy's life.
Yes, it's grainy and black and white, but they did a good job of it and I'll treasure it always.
If you remember this short movie, don't hesitate to add it to your Christmas movie collection.
It's a keen part of American life in the 1930's, something that our children will never know.",1418947200,,381,4.305555555555555
1919288,2,B0000CGDQQ,"Better than nothing, but not much. Poor quality black and white. I agree with other reviewers. Why isn't this restored by the powers that be?

1919293,1,B0000CGDQQ,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. Being that Truman Capote's A Christmas Story was my sister's favorite movie, I bought this for her birthday, to replace her aging VHS copy that she taped from TV. I meant to surprise her with something special for her birthday, so I didn't bother reading the reviews. Her taped VHS version was in color. My assumption that I was getting the real deal turned out to be a big letdown for both of us, and I felt ""ripped off""  when we discovered this was a poorly made black and white copy of the movie.  If Amazon described it as a B&W copy, I missed it. I'm asking Amazon for a return authorization.",1406851200,,641,4.378151260504202

1919297,5,B0000CGDQQ,"As so many have already said, this is an exquisite film.  Geraldine Page is wonderful as always, but her performance here is stellar; and Donny Melvin, who plays the young Capote, seems more comfortable after the first scene.  Everything about this dramatization captures the bygone era in which the story is set.  If you can find an online copy of this dvd (or Capote's other story, The Thanksgiving Visitor, do not expect superior quality in either the film or audio.  Ms. Page also stars in the Thanksgiving film, but the young boy is played by another actor.  In a way, however, the ""soft-focus"" appearance of the scenes and the ""scratchiness"" of the narration and dialogue - due in part to being copied from a distant television broadcast - adds to the  enchantment of both films.  I'm not sure how young people would enjoy these these films, but if you were born as late as the 60s, you should enjoy the journey back to a distant, more simple locale and way of life that is far removed from today's.  I love watching these films every year; they help re-focus my attention and keep me more centered during the holiday madness.",1403913600,,1132,4.653266331658291

1919311,5,B0000CGDQQ,I've watched this film since I was a small girl and was thrilled to find it on DVD. It's a lovely story from Capote's childhood and recounts a part of his life with a distant cousin wonderfully portrayed by Geraldine Page. Many parts of it are narrated by Capote himself. This is truly one of my favorite films of all time.,1395532800,,323,4.311475409836065

1919314,5,B0000CGDQQ,"This heartfelt Christmas offering from my chidhood has always remained in my own memories of Christmas. I own a VHS copy, but wanted a more stable copy on DVD, so I could enjoy this Christmas Classic for many more years to come. I love that Truman narrates the film, so you get the authentic inflection of his own voice telling this story. It comes straight from his heart to your ears. Geraldine Page is heart rendering in her performance of his special childhood 'friend' and of the impact she had on his life. Get you keenex out, this is a tearjerker. Love, Love, Love it!",1393804800,,575,4.485714285714286
1919315,5,B0000CGDQQ,"This was exactly, exactly the way I remember it from when I was a kid in the sixties.  Both actors are at the top of their game.  This version has not been ""cleaned up;"" you can tell it was made from actual film, which adds to the charm.  I like this film even better than the story in print, which is one of my favorites.  It's not Christmas until Geraldine Page tells us that ""It's fruitcake weather, Buddy!""  She's the biggest fruitcake around and I adore this movie.",1392681600,,470,4.295454545454546

1919318,5,B0000CGDQQ,"Truman Capote personally loved this version and I agree, Geraldine Page is wonderful as Sook! The time period and the place are captured in detail and the black and white world of the 30's is spot on.",1389830400,2,200,4.4324324324324325

1919320,5,B0000CGDQQ,"Although the technology of the sixties is absolutely evident in this misty black-and-white offering, it is the real thing! I viewed this presentation on our small-screened black and white TV back when it was originally aired ( I was not yet thirty years old). Loved it then. Cherish it now. I read the short story every year as the holidays approach. However, I now have so much more appreciation of the story and Truman Capote's talent as I soak it all in once again through the author's own distinctive voice and reflexivity. And absolutely no actress living or dead can match Geraldine Page's performance in her leading roll as the aging child-like distant cousin.",1389484800,,667,4.859649122807017
1919321,5,B0000CGDQQ,Loved the DVD...thank you for having it for my purchase.  I saw this show many years ago and tried to access the DVD.  Only AMAZON had the DVD.  I purchased 2 and the 2nd DVD was for a Christmas gift.  Thank you AMAZON for giving me a new Christmas memory.,1389052800,,256,4.06
1919322,5,B0000CGDQQ,This is a classic old gem from Stage 67.  It is a meaningful story of the holidays that took place during the depression era when people had no money to spend.  The acting is excellent and Geraldine Page's performance is terrific.  I watched A Christmas Memory  during the sixties when I was just a little girl.  This DVD brought back fond memories and it is a very welcome addition to our family DVD holiday classics!,1388707200,,418,4.52
1919323,5,B0000CGDQQ,This  is  one of  my  family's all- time  Christmas  favorites.  The  story  and  acting  are  wonderful  and  exactly  as  remembered.  Unfortunately  the  sound  quality  is awful.  I  assume  this  is  probably  due  to  the 1966  technology.  However  it  is  the  only  way  to  appreciate  this  amazing  story.,1388361600,,317,4.8936170212765955
1919324,5,B0000CGDQQ,"The gritty resolution of this black and white film only adds to its enamor.  Set in Alabama during the depression It is Truman Capote's autobiographical account of his childhood and of the spiritual love he had for one of his aunts.  She is a tragic figure with no worldly possessions.  But she is completely innocent and in her innocence, there is a profound saintliness.  It is at once a heart wrenching and a heart warming story.  I first saw it in the sixties when I too was in my childhood.  I discovered it when I was flipping through the channels.  Half a century later, it came to mind one day and I had to buy it.  It is a haunting story.",1388275200,,647,4.289256198347108

1919326,3,B0000CGDQQ,"While Capote's story and this screen version is DELIGHTFUL, the quality of this dvd is a disappointment!  It arrived in a plain plastic box without label or picture or anything. The title was printed on the dvd. Looks like a home-job. The recording quality is VERY poor. Grainy picture. Sound is bad -- either very high and harsh or very quiet. No modulation on the sound. I do not know who is mass-producing these dvds but I would not recommend them.

It's a shame, because this little film is a gem and I cannot understand why it is not still in circulation with a higher quality label/producer. I ordered it because it is hard to find. I used to see it occasionally on PBS. It is Truman Capote's bio of a time in his childhood that was sweet and innocent, full of love and acceptance. Colorful characters and Geraldine Page is THE quintessential eccentric ""special friend"" for whom the world was made less bleak and more magical for the lonely little Truman's boyhood days before he was eventually sent off to boarding school. Read the book! And then, if you can find a better copy of the movie, by all means get it to add to your Christmas spirit!",1387497600,3,1151,4.502392344497608

1919330,5,B0000CGDQQ,"The poignant story of a young boy his elderly, child-like aunt lovingly caring for one another while gather ingredients with their saved pennies, and preparing fruit cakes for others for Christmas is delightful.

Oh joy again--so I thought until I played it. This copy is so bad I couldn't watch it. Faces are indistinguishable, picture is blurry and wavy. So disappointed!

However, I was very disappointed with the packaging and remastering quality of this film. It deserves so much more.

 While the video quality is fine, nothing was done to the master. All the scratches and holes of the original black and white film are still there, along with audio distortions now and then. The DVD is obviously a + or -R burn, it's purple, and it came in a typical CD case with nothing else.

I suppose I should be happy to have the movie in its ""natural"" form, though. But when buying the DVD, I do expect a professional production job. I didn't get that.

For those who've seen the more modern remake, forget it and have a look at this one. Truly Capote's masterpiece, especially for anyone who has lost someone so special in their own lives as Miss Sook was in Buddy's.

Still, I give the film 5 stars, and the packaging /mastering 1.",1355616000,2,1071,4.383838383838384
1919350,5,B0000CGDQQ,"A Christmas Memory, written by Truman Capote and adapted for the screen here is perhaps my favorite of all Christmas movies - there's just a certain poignancy and nostalgia about it that warms my heart and makes me yearn fiercely for days long past, and the years appear to slip away, taking me back to my own childhood, sitting at the kitchen table while my grandmother baked fruit cakes for her family and friends. So you see, this movie holds a very special place in my heart.

The film is narrated by Buddy (voiced by Truman Capote himself, and the story is based on his own childhood experiences), a young boy who is being cared for by his eccentric old cousin Sook (Page). Christmas is approaching and Sook has decided it is ""fruit cake time"". The pair go off on a pecan gathering expedition, and later scramble together their meager savings to purchase the necessary groceries. There is obviously a genuine affection between the two - Buddy loves his Cousin Sook and the feelings are mutual. Sook may not be the typical older relative, she gives Buddy a little whisky left over from baking, something that would get the old lady a prison sentence these days, but this was long ago, and the way it is narrated on screen, makes it seem like a harmless little eccentricity more than anything else. There are other memorable characters such as Mr. Ha-ha who is the go-to guy for dispensing liquor, and whose hardened visage is softened by his suggestion that Sook keep her money and trade one of her fruitcakes for his bottle of whisky.

Geraldine Page not only delivers a compelling performance, she lives it. Having read the book and watched the screen adaptation, Page was Sook, in all her glorious eccentricity. Sook bakes the fruitcakes out of kindness and love, often for complete strangers she connected with over a short encounter - a couple heading to California who stopped over one day, and many others. She even mails one to the White House! There are little nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout this delightful classic, and at the end, one is left feeling nostalgic for bygone days, and craving a slice of homemade fruitcake:-) I found both the B&W and the full color version of this movie on Youtube. I would buy the color version in a heartbeat if the DVD were available.",1354492800,,2291,4.696517412935323

I was happy to find that someone had finally put it for sale. There has been a coloured movie of this story with new actors, which I also bought here but we like the original. It is a story of a part of Truman Capote's life when he was a young boy. The story tells of the closeness and understanding between him and his aunt that he lived with. She makes fruitcakes for many people at Christmas as she has to save up her pennies all year to buy the ingredients that are needed to make the cakes. It was a different innocent time and the movie is delightful.",1327881600,2,684,4.150375939849624
1919357,5,B0000CGDQQ,"The best Christmas movie ever. The story is set in the Depression-era South and centers around two people--a 7-year-old boy and his elderly, eccentric cousin-- and one dog.  I know, it sounds sappy, but believe me, it's not.  I defy the most hardened cynic to watch this without being moved.

Virtually ignored and unloved by the relatives who give them grudging shelter, the boy and his cousin form a bond, shielding one another from the casual cruelty of the other inhabitants of the house. They are inseparable and make the most of the very little they have.  Their annual milestones are building the kites they will exchange and fly at Christmas, and preparing the Christmas fruitcakes.  Baking the fruitcakes means spending their savings...acccumulated nickel by painful nickel and at great sacficie to both. The fruitcakes are their shout out to the world, and are sent to favored film stars, world leaders, President Franklin Roosevelt -- all the people Buddy and Sook admire.  It doesn't sound like much of a plot, and it's not. The beauty is in the simplicity and the interaction between Geraldine Page (who won an Emmy for this one-hour television production in 1966) and Donnie Melvin who plays Buddy.

Written by Truman Capote and Eleanor Perry for ABC Stage 67 and based on his own ""christmas memories,"" this fragile and unforgettable story puts to shame all those sappy, syrupy movies about Christmas Miracles and the endless rehashes of ""A Christmas Carol"" starring television's latest heart throbs and has beens. It is the antidote to the seasonal onslaught of crudely animated cartoons.  The word 'heartwarming is thrown around like magic fairy dust over every ""family"" movie Hollywood churns out.  ""A Chrismas Memory"" is the real thing.  The only heart it cannot melt is a heart turned to stone.

Several other versions have been filmed, including one with Patty Duke.  This is by far the best.  Make it an annual tradition...a cup of eggnog, a box of tissues and ""A Christmas Memory.""

Gratuitous Question:  Didn't the town in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" look a lot more interesting in the version without George?",1324512000,3,2128,4.9886685552407934

Her Christmas gifts are special cakes she makes every year, and the story includes character studies in the connections between the old woman and the young boy during very hard times for both.  The story is very moving, and an absolute perfect replacement for the worn-out Christmas Story seen on every channel almost daily during the holiday season.
Gives very good insight into how hard times were in the depression, and also how difficult it was for people who lived in a rural setting back then.

The colorized version is beautiful, but it tricks you into ""forgetting"" what a tough environment it was that Capote was raised in. I think I actually prefer the black and white version - and I still can't watch it without sobbing at the end.

Capote was a strange bird, no doubt about it. But his early work - novellas and short stories - are just amazing. A Christmas Memory remains one of the best Christmas stories ever and maybe explains a little bit how he turned out the way he did.",1293753600,3,763,4.45

Capote based the story on his own childhood experiences and even narrates the telefilm. Geraldine Page won a well-deserved Emmy Award for her beautiful portrayal of Sook, the elderly cousin. Page would go on to recreate the role a year later in THE THANKSGIVING VISITOR and garnered another Emmy. I have to say that I am very surprised at all of the negative feedback that has been left about the DVD of A CHRISTMAS MEMORY. Yes this is a black and white print of a color broadcast but the picture quality isn't half bad and at least the DVD offered here features the program in its entirity.

I remember seeing this the first time, running to buy the book the next day and always think of the story at Christmas.  I once copied it on a video -- it was  a very bad copy in the early years but it still was a blessing to own.  Now I have no video or VCR and I have longed to find a DVD.  To find A CHRISTMAS MEMORY today was wonderful.  You have made my CHRISTMAS even more Merry!

I saw Patty Duke yesterday (again) doing the part on TV and she is great, no doubt about it, but no one will ever be Geraldine Page.  It is cold today and I can hear Geraldine Page saying, ""Buddy, it is fruit cake weather.""  Buddy truly was Truman Capote as a child.

I will wait and come again to tell you how wonderful the story is and update my review;  I know I will burst into tears, as I always do, when I see the video or read the book.

Capote and his narration, the other half, seems to be a ""mere"" reporter, including very little of his own emotional involvement, but his detail and his timing make this a bright and tear-stained journey back into childhood for anyone.  The video quality is abominable, and seems worse than I remember from our original VHS copy taped years ago, and recently lost.

I was ecstatic to finally find a copy of the movie to have for my own.  How sad that these days you cannot find this type of movie on television anymore.  Oh sure, the networks will play to death ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and rightfully so, but what about gems like this movie, that deserve to be in the category of a Christmas Classic?

My copy is better than any copy I have seen and I don't understand why the licensee or ABC or who ever owns the rights can't get a color copy from the FAMILY CHANNEL ( which is no longer the FAMILY CHANNEL - Is it TBS now?) or some PBS channel which also use to show the film around Christmas time! Maybe ABC could restore it to its original form. My copy is excellent compared to others I have seen but certainly not a restored copy type version.,1190073600,51,726,4.0137931034482754

Geraldine Page, who won the Emmy, is mesmerizing as Capote's eccentric cousin Sook - though we never hear her name in this movie version.  Capote's distinctive voice provides some of the most emotional moments of the film - underscored by an enchanting musical score that is woven into the scenery.  The relationship we come to experience in A Christmas Memory is its most memorable aspect - and you will undoubtedly make this a seasonal event, as I have for over 20 years.

1919437,5,B0000CGDQQ,"Truman Capote's ""A Christmas Memory"" is, perhaps, my favorite short story.  I re-read it each Christmas.  In 1966, at the height of his fame, Capote wrote this adaptation and provided the narration for this hour-long film.

Geraldine Page IS Sook Faulk.  She's NOT acting.  She simply IS her - and always will be as far as I am concerned.  This film gets my vote for the most perfect hour of television - ever.  The performances, the story, the narration - nothing could be improved upon.  The final scene with the spinster and child flying kites becomes almost unbearable when Miss. Sook reveals her heart: ""I've always thought a body would have to be sick and dying before they saw the Lord.  And I imagined that when He came it would be like looking at the Baptist window: pretty as colored glass with sun pouring through, such a shine you don't know it's getting dark.  And it's always been a comfort: to think of that shine taking away all the spooky feeling.  But I'll wager it never happens.  I'll wager at the very end a body realizes the Lord has already shown Himself.  That things as they are, just what they've always seen, was seeing him.  As for me, I could leave the world with today in my eyes.""  I feel that same way when I watch this little film.  It communicates so much, so simply.

Now, as for this black & white copy - what's up with that?  This was filmed in color.  The print I recorded is in color.  It's beautiful.  I've haven't yet seen ""The Thanksgiving Visitor"" - why doesn't some company release these two films together on one DVD - fully restored????  It would make a perfect Christmas gift for anyone who considers themselves a fan of either Truman Capote or Geraldine Page.  Trivia:  Did you know that Capote and Page each won Emmy Awards for their work on ""A Christmas Memory""?  True.  Page won a second Emmy for ""The Thanksgiving Visitor.""  All the more reason these should be preserved on DVD.

Update: 11/19/2006 - I've had two more people contact me about this review and this very special little movie - it's still NOT out on DVD - A&E if you're listenting, please rebroadcast this.  ABC is you still own the rights - put it on DVD now!",1131926400,110,2176,4.479591836734694

unforgettable. The authentic Southern setting looks so real that it
hurts, at least to one who raided a pecan orchard or two in his own
time. The color photography of the entire picture is muted and excellent.""
-- from Howard Thompson's review of A Christmas Memory (in its
theatrical release) from the November 7th, 1969, New York Times.

It's a rare pleasure to watch this dramatization of a piece of great
American literature, and it has become a ritual in my home to watch
this movie with friends and family each year. Donnie Melvin and
Geraldine Page work so well together, they truly bring the story to life.
Hard to imagine, but the original short story was written while author
Truman Capote was vacationing in Hong Kong.

A Christmas Memory was filmed in direct collaboration with Mr. Capote,
and it won many awards, including a Peabody and three Emmys, after it
first aired on ABC Television's Stage67 series.

One problem: This VHS cassette is in black and white and thus offers a
diminished experience from what was created in the 1966 color original.
The story still shines through, but this small gem deserves
better. A color copy of A Christmas Memory of equivalent quality to the
above can be found online elsewhere.",1130371200,98,1370,4.821276595744681

It is a low budget, black & white film produced by the then fledgling network ABC, but this does not detract from the wonderful performance by, especially Geraldine Page, as well as the rest of the troupe of actors. In fact, I think the whole thing could have been done on a blank stage without distraction because of the depth of the Truman's story, his presentation of the little things of that period in his life and of the gifted performers.  Let me also recommend A Christmas Memory, One Christmas, & The Thanksgiving Visitor (Modern Library), also available here.
