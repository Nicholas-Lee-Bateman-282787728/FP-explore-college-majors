8745265,3,B019HOVQQ6,This rating is for the disappointing print used by Warner Archive. Nothing remastered here. The film itself is a nice musical with several good and tuneful numbers. But why Warner Archive were not able to get a better print I don't know. In Germany we had a very good print. But the Warner Archive one has a lot of scenes with a very soft or out of focus picture. However mostly the picture is very sharp . Also the Technicolor is not very good. I can not understand that as Warner should have access to their own Archive where a better print should exist.,1456876800,3,556,4.355769230769231
