8543854,5,B009RJRHEM,"Elizabeth Taylor is a collection of great movie clips, and interviews of Elizabeth Taylor, and tells the story of her life. It is very good. Elizabeth Taylor fans will like it the most.",1435708800,,185,4.636363636363637
8543855,5,B009RJRHEM,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this documentary about the immortal Elizabeth Taylor. So much footage I have not seen, the colorization was top notch, and this is a great gift for anyone who (like me) adores those stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1395619200,2,251,4.8604651162790695
8543856,5,B009RJRHEM,"Good Documentary...A little on the cheaper side as far as the making of it, but good documentary for her fans..I enjoyed it.",1391558400,2,124,4.681818181818182
8543857,2,B009RJRHEM,"I think the reviewer who gave this title a 5-star rating must have seen some other work. It surely could not have been this one.

The downside - there is absolutely nothing new. Elizabeth's life story is told in a most elementary 1,2,3, manner. Most of the footage consists of film clips and trailers, the majority of which look like third-generation copies; scratchy, somewhat blurred, black and white (while the originals were in color), etc. I had to laugh out loud when the narrator pronounced her famous pearl, ""La Peregrina"" (""Lah Pair-uh-GREE-nah"") as......oh my Lord........Lah Purr-GEE-nah!!! For Taylor fans, that's as bad as calling her Krupp diamond (now the Elizabeth Taylor diamond) the Krip! Worst of all is the fact this ""biography"" was produced in very early 1993! Receiving the Jean Hersholt award, a career milestone awarded her in March 1993 is not mentioned. NOTHING of her life after the Fortensky marriage is mentioned. Her death received only an ""after-the-fact"" caption that was obviously added recently. This is clearly a re-released work, the producers of which decided it wasn't worth their time to update.

The upside - there are a precious few vintage and in-person clips. A few, actually, quite good. These clips are the only thing that kept me from giving this a 1-star rating and the only thing that makes my purchase tolerable.",1364342400,4,1361,5.044444444444444
8543858,5,B009RJRHEM,"Not sure what movie the other reviewer watched, this documentary was surprisingly good.  It is full of interview clips, some scene out takes, and tells a really good and accurate story of her life.  I enjoyed it very much.",1361232000,2,222,4.666666666666667
8543859,1,B009RJRHEM,"This is one of those exploitation videos.  It consists primarily of scenes from various movies.  To illustrate how bad this is, the producers could not even spell Eddie Fisher's name correctly on the back cover.  I adore this remarkable woman, but this dvd  is just junk.",1361145600,4,271,4.826086956521739
