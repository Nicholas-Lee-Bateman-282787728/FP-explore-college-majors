6478645,5,B00LAHVQ78,"This DVD gives a variety of workouts.  The best part that I like is that she gives instructions that are clear, and demonstrates the different moves so you can understand exactly the proper form you need to achieve the movement.  It was a little challenging; however, if you are working out regularly, this would not be so difficult.",1440374400,8,333,4.724137931034483
6478646,5,B00LAHVQ78,I love this workout.,1431648000,2,20,4.25
6478647,5,B00LAHVQ78,"Have only been using this for a couple of days but I love it already.  first off there is a workout calendar included.  simply go to the calendar and it will break down which videos you should do.  you can pull up week one and will give you the daily breakdown and play those videos for you.  If you would rather put together your own daily workout it allows you to pick and choose as you would like.

I love the stretching at the beginning.  there is a clock to give you countdown of how much time till you are done.  its set up so that you do 3-4 moves x3.  there is a lot of getting down on the floor and then getting back up again..... so you will be moving!  she really pushes the fact that you should do the moves at your own speed and really get the technique done.

day one for instance of week one you do an upper body stretch and then HIIT training for upper body.  abs at end.  day two focuses on lower body.  there are a couple days of yoga.  you are set up to work out 6 days per week.

I researched a lot before buying this one and the great reviews that I read appear to be all true.",1431302400,28,1098,3.9272727272727272
6478648,4,B00LAHVQ78,Good set up- the calendar is easy to follow.  And if you are not quite there yet she offers a lower impact choice.,1430265600,5,114,3.9565217391304346
6478649,5,B00LAHVQ78,On week 5 and this is an intense workout that changes daily and produces results. I feel stronger and am not bored. It's a manageable time commitment - workouts ranging from about 20 min to about 45 min so perfect for a busy lifestyle. Highly recommend. I will probably repeat the program later in the year.,1427846400,19,307,4.5
6478650,4,B00LAHVQ78,"Loved the workout. However, there's no information included with the DVD on how to use it for the 6 weeks. Beach body does a much better job with the Tony Horton P90, P90X, etc.,. DVDs giving you everything you need to start your program without having to go online...",1426291200,,268,4.489795918367347
6478651,3,B00LAHVQ78,"This may be a great workout for young athletic people, but it was way too strenuous for an older exerciser, even one accustomed to P90X!",1424304000,4,136,4.48
6478652,3,B00LAHVQ78,I like the exercises. Perfect for an intermediate exerciser. Was a bit disappointed that I had to search the website for the exercise calendar. Figured it would be in the packaging since it was advertised as being included.,1459900800,7,223,4.894736842105263
6478653,5,B00LAHVQ78,If you do the workouts in the sequence shown on the calendar for the 6 days a week for 6 weeks you will absolutely see results. I was super excited to see muscles in my arms that I never had before. The workouts are short and effective. I honestly think anyone that is in somewhat decent shape could do this workout just vary the amount of weight you use. I used 5lbs the entire time and will increase to 8lbs next time around. I like that you can mix and match workouts on your own too. If I'm running late in the morning I can do an 8-10 minute HIIT workout or quickly do the 6 minute total core workout after a cardio session. Also the yoga is a great bonus for a day you may need a little break but still want to get something in. Very happy with my purchase!,1458259200,14,763,4.026315789473684
6478654,3,B00LAHVQ78,"This program is good if you are just starting out to work-out at home. But videos aren't exactly for 30 mins in first few weeks. Plus I found them less challenging after 2-3 weeks because it was the same set of exercises but with more repetitions.
Good for a beginner level but not advanced",1457913600,2,290,4.388888888888889
6478655,3,B00LAHVQ78,"Quick workout but did nothing for my lower body. I completed all 6 weeks and my upper body was very strong & lean. I'm pear shaped, so I hold most of my weight from the hips down. It just wasn't enough to strengthen & tone my hips, glutes, & legs.",1457481600,4,247,3.96

6478658,5,B00LAHVQ78,"I did not think I would like this video--when I received it, I saw that all of the segments are short, and I am used to longer workouts--these HiiT workouts are just around 15 minutes, so I just put two together.  I workout all the time, and with difficult DVDs (Cathe Friedrich, P90X, etc) but I was actually sore after using the lower body HiiTs.  My husband likes the ab workout (because it's just 5 minutes!) and I love the foam roller bonus.

I would say, though, that the only drawback is that there is no cool down--at all. She has a yoga segment, and a roller segment, but none of the cardio or weight segments include any type of cool down or stretch, which is odd.  I have to do my own thing, or pull out another DVD and skip to the cool down and stretch.",1451433600,11,765,4.183673469387755
6478659,5,B00LAHVQ78,Great workout dvd! Enjoyed the workouts and saw definition after the 6 weeks!!,1445817600,4,78,5.076923076923077

6478661,4,B00LAHVQ78,The DVD is good but not great in my opinion.  Some of the workouts do not have music and I need music in the background.  That's just my preference.,1440720000,,148,4.068965517241379

8664866,5,B00LAHVQ78,I have a large collection of exercise DVDs and I love this one.  The calendar is already setup for you. You select your week and day and it will play automatically.  I love that you don't need a printed calendar.  I stretch and foam roll after every workout. You will see definition in your muscles if you stick to this program.,1515542400,,328,4.344262295081967
8664867,5,B00LAHVQ78,"I love how this DVD is set-up with different options. As a busy mom, I like that the exercises are in smaller groupings so I can pause in between sets if needed. I saw several comments that people did not receive the 6 week training calendar, but easily found the icon on the home screen. I also Googled ""Ashley Borden 6 weeks to  Sculpted Training Calendar"" & downloaded a PDF.",1509148800,2,378,4.4
8664868,2,B00LAHVQ78,"I can't believe this DVD got such good reviews.  She basically does 4 different exercises, all variations on lunges and squats, and repeats them in all the different workouts.  It is really boring.  I've been looking for something similar to Physique 57, which has varying, effective workouts toning all your muscle groups - sadly, this DVD isn't it!",1491177600,4,350,5.0

8664870,3,B00LAHVQ78,"First off, I hate working out, let's just get that out there. I try but I just don't find much that I like anything. I tried this based on all the great reviews, both personal and professionals. It's not bad but I don't jump for joy when it's time to work out to this. I actually hate her warm ups, they seem pointless and too long. The workouts themselves aren't too bad and they are honestly really short, that's how I convince myself to use it. I love that you can go to the day in the menu and select it so it will play all the workouts for that day so you don't have to go back and forth on the menu. You will need a foam roller to roll out. I did like this part, as I'm new to rolling out and felt like that helped. Honestly I haven't made it through all six weeks so I guess that's why I'm not sculpted yet, ha ha. I didn't really notice any change in my physique while doing this even when I was on Whole30 and lost 10 pounds. I'm sure it takes longer but I was secretly hoping it would literally only take a few weeks. The one really bad thing for me is that this workout has a lot of squats! Pretty much every segment, except warm ups, yoga and rolling out have several varieties of squats. I don't have the best knees and partly the reason I haven't gotten to week six is that my knees start aching after a week or 2. I've researched squats and realize I'm probably doing them wrong and have tried and tried to fix my form but haven't been able to. So if you have great young knees or proper squat technique then this might be better for you. If not maybe look elsewhere.",1482278400,,1582,4.04140127388535
8664871,4,B00LAHVQ78,"It's been a lot longer than 6 weeks and I'm still not sculpted, but it is hardly her fault.  These exercises are pretty hard on my knees, so I didn't rally stick with it very long...",1480550400,,182,4.055555555555555
8664872,3,B00LAHVQ78,"Purchased 6 Weeks to sculpted to follow 2 rounds of the 21 day fix by beachbody.  The workouts on this dvd are good and I think effective.  However, you can definitely tell that the production aspects of the DVD are lacking.  For example, in the Yoga session as well as one of the upper body HIIT sessions, the background music abruptly stops half way through the workout.  Further, and this just might be my disc, the workout just stopped playing for full body resistance training B.
I really like her roll-out stretch.
If you are already working out, the first week (maybe two weeks) is going to be easy and short.  I took it as a mini-break.  But, the DVD is definitely setup for beginners in the first two weeks.",1477872000,7,716,4.469230769230769
8664873,5,B00LAHVQ78,"I wish I could give this a 4.5.  I do love the workout, but I have a few cons that would drop it from a 5 to a 4.5. :)

I bought 6 weeks to Sculpted after reading a review in Fitness Magazine.  I was debating between this and the P90 program, and went with this one because it had good reviews and because it was cheaper.  About me: I am an avid fan of Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner, but I found myself struggling to lose weight (post baby and now in my 40s) and I wanted to try something different.  I am a working mom who gets up early to exercise, so my time is limited.  I read good things about trying HIIT workouts, and this program sounded like a perfect match.

Pros
1. You will definitely sweat
2. Results! I feel stronger and can see my arms and thighs toning up (I'm on week 5)
3. Rolling out - this was new to me, and I love it.  I feel like it loosens up my tight (ache-y) muscles
4. Time saving - the first 4 weeks the workouts are under 30 minutes.  By week 5, expect to kick it up a notch in your time planning.

Cons
1. This workout is rough on my knees.  There are many lunges and squats in all of the workouts, regardless of whether it's cardio, hiit, or a strength building workout.
2. Someone in one of the reviews mentioned that there's no stretching after the workout, and she's right.  Sometimes I remember to do it on my own, and sometimes I don't.  On the days when you end your workout with the rolling out, that seems sufficient to stretch tight muscles.
3. I would like if the calendar was printed and included as an insert in the DVD, but I just took a picture each week on my phone and knew what I was in for. :)",1464825600,14,1648,4.0184049079754605
