8534750,4,B0092HOMO2,"This is a native 3d nature film. Where we follow the journey of the monarch butterflies. It's a pretty 3d adventure , and it's typical of this type of nature film. HOWEVER it's about butterflies, so don't expect action or adventure here.  The 3d is very good and that's about the whole deal here. It's a good one for 3d collectors and a average nature film , with lots of beautiful film shots here.  The 2d version is half the film and is there any doubt that all nature films would benefit from a 3d release?  2d is flat , nature is NOT 2d.",1450224000,2,541,4.1826923076923075
8534751,2,B0092HOMO2,"We bought this DVD because we thought it would be to the standards of the PBS DVDs or other such wildlife documentaries.  What we received looked like an amateur student project.  First, there were some wonderful scenes of the overwintering grounds in Mexico that were repeated and repeated throughout the entire DVD.  The 3D technology was not done well and often looked cartoon-ish or 'off'.  There was a narrator who would use the wrong words such as using ""cocoon"" instead of using the word 'pupa' or 'chrysalis'.  Moths and other insects use a cocoon, not monarchs.  The professor being interviewed seemed tired and bored with the interview and he spoke for long periods of time which was quite dull.  They showed graphs of the three countries where the migration takes place - Mexico/U.S./Canada and would show the migration by using crude models of two or three monarchs going up or down the country.  You could tell that the models of monarchs were being guided through a cut in the back with someone's hand doing the guiding.  It was just crude and unprofessional.  I give it 2 stars instead of one because it was decently packaged and arrived when it was supposed to.  The quality was not to standards of other documentaries though and if I had known this I would not have bought it.",1421193600,7,1293,4.727678571428571
