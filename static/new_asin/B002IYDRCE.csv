8371303,1,B002IYDRCE,"This is the first negative report I have ever written.

Other products may not have been very good but they were not sold under misleading pretenses.

This CD is simply a recording, and a poor quality one at that,  of a radio program where the interviewer, not a very skilled one, asks rather mundane questions of a so-called palmist. One senses the latter has material to share but the unsophisticated interviewer never gets around to critical points.

I am hard pressed to think of why anybody should listen to this CD  -- much less buy it.",1330387200,3,542,4.604166666666667
