2344570,1,B000A0D1QK,"Absolutely terrible, this is the worst I have ever seen on DVD.  They took three great movies and watered them down so bad that you cannot even see them.  Not even the newest one, Tarzan and the Trappers came in watchable.  This is very unusual for something that Amazon sells.  It's not their fault but that of the idiots who put this mess on DVD!!!  I have old Sword and Sandal movies from the 60's that come in 100% better than these.  Please don't purchase this DVD!!!  Sorry Amazon!",1170806400,13,487,4.404494382022472
2344571,4,B000A0D1QK,"There are several sets of Tarzan DVD's available. Unfortunately, many share the same movies.

The Johnny Weismuller set, (The Tarzan Collection Starring Johnny Weissmuller), with six movies on 4 discs contains the best movies. The DVD picture and sound quality are good for movies that are over 60 years old.

The purpose of my review is to compare this set, (Tarzan: King of the Jungle), with a comparable set, (Tarzan 5 Movies on 2 Discs). Both sets contain the following movies and actors:

""Tarzan and the Trappers"" - Gordon Scott

""Tarzan the Fearless"" - Buster Crabbe

""Tarzan's Revenge"" - Glenn Morris

""Tarzan and the Green Goddess"" - Bruce Bennett

This set contains a second Bruce Bennett movie, ""The New Adventures of Tarzan.""

The other set (Tarzan 5 Movies on 2 Discs) contains an Elmo Lincoln movie, ""Tarzan of the Apes,"" in lieu of the second Bruce Bennett movie.

The difference in costs between the two sets as of the date of this review is over $15. This set, (Tarzan: King of the Jungle), is priced over $25. The other set, (Tarzan 5 Movies on 2 Discs) is priced under $10.

If price is a concern, the other set (Tarzan 5 Movies on 2 Discs) offers the better value.",1151712000,19,1184,4.649038461538462
2344572,3,B000A0D1QK,"The TARZAN, KING OF THE JUNGLE set is probably of lasting interest only to Tarzan completists, but it does nicely complement THE TARZAN COLLECTION.  The latter comprises Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's six Johnny Weissmuller/Maureen O'Sullivan pairings -- the name-brand Ape-Man flicks of the 1930s; KING OF THE JUNGLE showcases the same decade's Brand X Tarzans, Buster Crabbe, Bruce Bennett, and Glenn Morris, as well as one of Weissmuller's successors, Gordon Scott.",1142121600,13,459,5.75

8071019,5,B000A0D1QK,It seems silly I know but my boss and I got to reminiscing about tarzan so I bought this series because he told me there were different leading men.  Wow this series brought back so many childhood memories and gave me some good trivia to take back to work for our discussion.,1423526400,,275,4.288461538461538
8071020,3,B000A0D1QK,"These videos are classic, old, kind of corny, he is always in a crisis.
He whips through the jungle with no problem at all, while everyone else slugs along, I will probably watch them and then wait a while before watching them again... but I am not disappointed with the product, it was filmed in the 1930's after all. The bad guy is really a monster, killing everyone that crosses him or gets in his way, including innocent people.
The film quality and sound is not great, just what you would expect from 1930.",1229299200,3,511,4.446808510638298
8071021,5,B000A0D1QK,I shall enjoy this feature and serial for some time to come. Thank you for the timely delivery at a reasonable price.,1220745600,,117,4.363636363636363
8071022,3,B000A0D1QK,"These films are all old black-and-white Tarzan films which have come into the public domain which means that anyone can copy and sell them.

This is about the nicest packaging I've seen of these great old flicks but, as others have pointed out, you can get the same films of equal print quality in a two-disc set at a much cheaper price. Here is the deal that will get you the same set of films:

If you enjoy the old black-and-white Tarzan films then you'll really enjoy these particular selections -- but don't be fooled by the colorful packaging into thinking that this is something new or improved!",1213833600,4,788,5.717948717948718
8071023,3,B000A0D1QK,"These old Black-and-White Tarzan films are in public domain -- none of the available prints are all that good.

BUT, if you go here, you can get the same Tarzan films plus two more for about the same price in nice packaging. You can read my full review there:

8071024,1,B000A0D1QK,N. Donvito's review was absolutely accurate. I only wish that I had read it in time. Poorest quality transfers that I have ever viewed.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD!  (You have been warned).,1207353600,2,187,4.636363636363637
