8638823,1,B00I3SW2YI,"CFS releasing should be ashamed of this sham DVD release. Interesting that the DVDs come with zero info about the company (no address, email, website or phone to complain about this) on the release. All 3 are full screen, grainy copies of poor VHS dupes.

Looks absolutely crappy on modern flat screen TVs. One would think they would attempt to make the quality a bit better since tube TVs are almost gone. But greed over having to spend cents more on multiple discs in a set influenced CFS to put 3 features on one DVD.

I still have my VHS copies of these 3 movies (""Snow Beast"", ""The Curse of Bigfoot"" & ""Beauties and the Beast"") and all 3 VHS tapes look better on my TV than this DVD. The images from the back of the box are taken from sources other than the movie. The grain is so bad on all 3 that this may be the most unwatchable DVD I have ever seen.

Do yourself a favor and do not by this set. I know there are completionists out there but this will only take up shelf space and there are better copies out there of all 3 films.",1403740800,16,1038,4.154228855721393
