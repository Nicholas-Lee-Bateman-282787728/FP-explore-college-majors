8424858,3,B004D7SBK2,"After Bound for Glory 2010, TNA had a major face-life in their main event. Hogan and Bischoff turned on the fans and started the Immortal faction and conspired to make Jeff Hardy their champion. During this time, Immortal employed Jeff Jarrett to take out Kurt Angle and Hardy disposed of Ken Anderson. At the same time, Immortal joined with Ric Flair's Fortune to form a super heel group that would dominate TNA... which is kind of sad actually. These guys needed higher aspirations.

Anyway, these two events happened directly after all this nonsense, and both events are largely forgettable place-holders. Both feature uninspired main events between Jeff Hardy and Matt Morgan, who turned face to cover a legit injury to Anderson, in which both men came away looking terrible. They were bad matches with schmozz finishes instead of building Hardy up for his feud with Anderson.

There were some good matches, though, and I would say they saved these shows from being completely forgotten. Turning Point features one really good match between Team 3D and the Motor City Machine Guns for the Tag Team Titles in what was billed as Team 3D's last match. Final Resolution does much better with a stronger overall card and two great matches: AJ Styles vs. Douglas Williams for the TV Title and The Motor City Machine Guns defending their Tag Team Titles against Generation Me in a Full Metal Mayhem match. Both matches are fantastic and at least make the in ring action worthwhile, which is better than the whole promotion putting their story lines in neutral for two months.

Sadly, too many talents are wasted on these shows: Samoa Joe, D'Angelo Dinero, Matt Morgan, Jay Lethal and Rob Van Dam are wasted in bad match ups with guys like Jeff Jarrett, Abyss and Rhino. Either through inane story lines, stupid gimmicks or poor booking, none of these guys are given credibility in their matches here.

If you want to see a time in TNA's past where it seemed things were gearing up to be interesting but they hadn't gotten there yet, then check out this twin pack. Otherwise, skip to Genesis 2011.",1408838400,,2093,4.821727019498607
8424859,4,B004D7SBK2,"Turning Point 2010:

Unfortunately this show is not very good. Immortal takes over and that does not make the ppv good. Team 3D's retirement (which just let them to break up instead of actually retiring), the non-sensical end to the Abyss/Dinero match, the continuation of the ECW guys legit being fired from TNA, just ugh. But there were 2 good things about this show. While the show lacks the, Hardy/Morgan main event does remain awesome and the Mickie James/Tara (particularily the brawl afterwards) is just awesome. But overall the show lacks.

Final Resolution 2010:

This show is a HUGE improvement. It feels more like an Extreme Rules ppv because there are so many different hardcore matches. Falls Count Anywhere Match, Full Metal Mayhem Match, Casket Match, No DQ Match, First Blood match, and the matches are great. This show is great from start to finish.",1404432000,,866,4.958620689655173

Joe/Magnus TV Title - this was a rematch from their great bfg match and this was a "" no dq "" match but only no dq moment , was usage of the chair but to be honest this delieverd as this topped their bfg match and was freaking great prob 2nd best tv title match behind the best witch was ""AJ/Williams"" from fr 2010 but this was a great opening match and really set the stage for the rest of the show with joe retaining

I would not pay for a pay per view like these only because i only order BFG and Wrestlemania but i wish i had ordered final resolution, my personal fav.

8424862,3,B004D7SBK2,"This is the fifth ""Cross The Line"" set from TNA but continuing to follow the pattern of the previous set in that this is a double pack of two PPV's.  These events happened after Bound For Glory & so much changed inbetween that time.  Hulk Hogan & Eric Bischoff were now in complete control of TNA with Sting & Kevin Nash walking out of the company as a result, the ""THEY"" that Abyss was talking about for months turned out to be the group now known as ""Immortal"" with himself & Jeff Jarrett & Jeff Hardy while also forming an alliance with Ric Flair's group of Fortune.

Turning Point '10
X Division Champion Jay Lethal vs. Robbie E - After attacking Lethal after his match at Bound For Glory, Robbie got his title shot here with Lethal in control early on before Robbie got control by blocking the Lethal Combination.  Robbie tried to ground & pound Lethal working over his stomach area.  Lethal got the upper hand on an exchange & delivered a series of punches on the floor but it was Cookie who kept causing distractions that worked against Lethal to the point where it was just too much to distract Lethal for Robbie to gain the victory & the championship in what was a solid match.

Mickie James vs. Tara - Just based off the prematch interview from Mickie & their confrontations on Impact, you got exactly what you expected here as Mickie walked right up to Tara & slapped her twice to open the match leading to both girls being in a very physical fight with Tara was constantly bad mouthing James & made it clear that she was more focused on just beating her up than winning the match.  They both kept fighting in & out of the ring to the point where they fought through the crowd & towards the stage where they were throwing each other into the stage & brought weapons into the fight such as a broom & trash can.  Security kept trying to break it up with no success as they brawled back to the ring with the crowd yelling to ""LET THEM FIGHT!"" before they were finally able to separate each other for the time being.  This was a very entertaining brawl that looked like an actual shoot more than your normal wrestling match that just built & built during the match until it finally broke lose after the match.  A couple of side notes here but pay attention to J.B.'s ring introduction as he was just having an off night for this match & this fight definitely didn't end here as it continued later on backstage.

TNA Tag Team Champions Team 3D vs. Motor City Machine Guns - Win, lose, or draw...this was the retirement match for Team 3D.  Anyone who's seen their matches in the past (which the Guns referenced to leading up to this match) knows that you were going to back a competitive match with both teams trading momentum throughout the contest & that was no different here with various moments such as Brother Ray going headfirst into a post & bleeding, Ray delivering an impactful Bubbabomb from a top rope, Ray & Shelley having a exchanging chops vs. kicks before Ray delivered a cutter/RKO on Shelley in midair, close near falls from both teams, Ray setting up the table in the corner & having it backfire on him, and Sabin kicking out of the 3D that caused the downfall for one of the greatest teams in history.  For the way this match was setup with it being a normal match & not any type of hardcore rules match (minus a table getting involved), this was a great quality match.

Rob Van Dam vs. Tommy Dreamer - After Eric Bischoff warned RVD that a member of his EV2 group had sold out to Immortal along with a bunch of incidents where it looked like each member of the group was a suspect, RVD went as far as to accuse Dreamer of being the ""mole"" leading to this match where Dreamer promised to beat some sense into RVD.  Even though this match wasn't labeled a ""hardcore rules"" match, they did go extreme here with various weapons coming into play such as a ladder & chair with RVD missing an apron leg drop on Dreamer but hitting a chair instead, Dreamer delivering a bulldog on a ladder, both Dreamer & RVD missing impactful moves & landing on the ladder, RVD missing a split legged moonsault onto a chair, and a 5 star frog splash on a chair.  The most impactful move of the match was Tommy delivering RVD's own frog splash but landed on his wrist wrong to the point where you could see the bone popping out of place to the point where RVD even hesitated to continue the match showing heavy concern for Dreamer.  This was a good match but gets more respect from me with Tommy Dreamer working how he did with a heavily visible broken wrist.

Fortune (A.J. Styles, Beer Money, Kaz, Douglas Williams) vs. EV2 (Sabu, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Brian Kendrick) - The stipulation for this match was that if EV2 loses this match then whoever lost the fall would be fired from TNA.  This started out as a brawl early on with Kendrick being taken out of the match with an injured knee.  While EV2 was able to get some shots in, this for the most part was a very dominate performance by Fortune with the team working over any EV2 member in the ring with quick tags & isolating them in the ring for a long period of time ending with Sabu's attempted Frankensteiner being turned into a Styles Clash to lose the fall & leave TNA...not before EV2 gave a nice tribute to Sabu before leaving.

Lumberjack Match: D'Angelo Dinero vs. Abyss - Due to Abyss attacking The Pope's fans on the previous Impact, the lumberjacks for this match were friends of Pope including his brother.  This was your stereotypical lumberjack match where Abyss was constantly thrown out into the lumberjacks to get thrown back into the ring quickly.  Pope came into the match with his ribs taped & Abyss targeted that with moves such as the bearhug while Pope kept fighting back with dives & headbutts off the top rope that still ended up hurting his own ribs as well.  This big story in this match was when Eric Bischoff made an appearance & gave a signal for the lumberjacks (including Pope's own brother) to turn on Pope helping Abyss get the victory.  Abyss & Pope tried her but this match just didn't seem to click while the lumberjacks turning didn't really seem to matter to me since we never saw these guys before this match...and have yet to see them again since.

Samoa Joe vs. Jeff Jarrett - Aside from Joe looking for revenge after being betrayed by Jarrett at Bound For Glory & everything that's happened since then, the new story that developed here was Jarrett playing off him mocking Joe's (and Kurt Angle's) own MMA background by wrestling a different style than we're used to as far as being more physical with moves such as the chops while even applying the anklelock submission at one point.  The finish involving the security of Gunner & Murphy was a little crooked but it did it's job in Jarrett gaining the tainted win so continue the Immortal's clean sweep.

World Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Morgan - With Mr. Anderson out with a concussion, the former ""insurance policy"" for Fortune in Matt Morgan stepped up & got the title shot here.  Morgan clearly had the power advantage by tossing Hardy around early to the point where Hardy was hobbling a little bit on the outside & kept trying to stall & break Morgan's momentum on the outside.  Hardy went to work on Morgan's legs by ""chopping the tree down"" to keep him down on the mat while Morgan was still able to recover with his power.  There was a point where Morgan had Hardy beat but the referee got hit with Hardy's foot so the referee assumed it was a kickout when it wasn't which came off real bad to the crowd & on the camera angles.  Eventually Hardy was able to retain the title after hitting his Twist Of Hate on Morgan for the third time throughout the match leading to a post match celebration with Fortune & Immortal.  It was an average encounter but at the very least made Morgan look strong as it took taking Hardy's finisher three different times to put him down while Hardy was a beaten man & would have lost the title if it wasn't for the referee's mistake.

Final Resolution '10
Ink Inc. vs. Beer Money - This was the match to determine the next challengers for the TNA Tag Team Championships.  This was areal solid opening match with both teams working hard as Neal & Moore looked very great & dominating the first half while Beer Money were their usual entertaining selves while putting up a fight in the second half.  One thing I have to point out is the reference Taz made to Jesse Neal's red hair that old school WWE fans will get a laugh at.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Mickie James vs. Tara - In the past few weeks, this has turned into possibly the most physically intense feud in the history of the Knockouts...or at the very least in a year since Tara vs. Kong.  Just knowing the nature of their past brawls, Tara demanded that Mickie start the fight on the floor & it started there before going into the ring, back to the floor, through the crowd, onto the outside of the Impact Zone, and ended up with both teams taking a page out of the ""Chris Benoit/Kevin Sullivan"" series by this ending up in the men's bathroom (complete with people at the urinals & in the stalls).  Both women used whatever they could get their hands on leading to this being a very entertaining brawl that was fun to watch.
As a side note, look for their steel cage match on the following Impact as that was quality as well in what I consider the feud of the year when it comes to the TNA Knockouts.

X Division Champion Robbie E. vs. Jay Lethal - Due to Cookie constantly getting involved in matches, the stipulation here was that she would be put in a shark cage for this match but since she refused to go in, we were treated with a special appearance from someone who loaned them the SHARK cage according to Taz.  Lethal gained control early on controlling the action with his fast paced style including some high flying like a top rope dropkick while Robbie was more concentrated on grounding Lethal with moves like the side headlock.  Despite being hung from the cage, Cookie still tried to get involved by tossing objects into the ring but Lethal was able to catch one of them & use it himself causing an disqualification...however Cookie's actions afterwards wouldn't go without notice as she was given a ""stunning"" consequence for her actions.  This match was better than their previous match at Turning Point with the only thing that hurt the match was the ending.

First Blood Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Rhino - After Dreamer & RVD fought the previous month, Rhino revealed himself as the ""mole"" in the EV2 group based off the fact that his contract expired & he was doing what he had to do to keep his job to support his family.  As usual in a first blood match, both men focused on each others head with various punches.  Rhino resorted to tactics like ramming RVD's head into the railing & steps while drilling RVD with a DDT.  During one point, RVD was focused on trying to go for internal injures by working over his stomach area to have him coughing up blood but in the end, it took his ultimate finishers of the Van Daminator & Van Terminator using pieces of a trash can to get the victory.  I thought it was an average match as I'm not a big fan of First Blood matches since they always seem very one dimensional with wrestlers heavily focusing on the head & just think this would have been a better contest if it was a normal match or another gimmick such as ""Last Man Standing.""

TNA Television Champion A.J. Styles vs. Douglas Williams - Before I get started, I suggest paying attention to the Kazarian promo before the match as it was the best promo I've heard from him in his career & he's association with Flair has payed off in that respect as it's done for A.J. Styles as well in the past year.
Both men came into this match with the crowd doing dueling chants early as both men attempted their finishers only for them to be countered early.  Douglas strayed away from his usual technical offense to pull off some various moves like a rolling cannonball from the apron to the floor on A.J. while later on going for another top rope move only for A.J. to throw him to the outside.  A.J. worked over Williams knee after Douglas was caught up in the ropes at one point with various holds like the figure four leading to both men rolling outside of the ring while still in the hold.  Williams was able to recover by throwing Styles into the guardrail before delivering his ""Rolling Chaos"" on the floor before defeating A.J. with his own Styles Clash to win the Television Championship.  This was a match that was back & forth action with some nice & unique spots that made Taz described this match perfectly, ""A purest dream match.""

Full Metal Mayhem Match: TNA Tag Team Champions Motor City Machine Guns vs. Generation Me - After going through so many matches throughout the year including Ultimate X & an empty arena match, the final battle here would be contested under TNA's version of a T.L.C./Tables & Ladders & Chairs match & you knew this match would be intense the moment the Guns came out & headed straight for Gen Me.  As expected this was filled with various crazy spots & moments such as Shelley doing a dragonscrew legwhip on Max while his leg a caught inbetween the steps of the ladder, Max being sandwiched between the ladders before Jeremy was suplexed & bulldog on top of that same ladder, all four men fighting on top of three ladders, Sabin delivering Chris Jericho's ""Codebreaker"" on Max forcing him to go face first into a chair, Shelley delivering a slice bread off the apron through a table, a dueling chair fight on top a table setup on top of two ladders, and the final crash through a table that long term fans will remember happening over a decade earlier in another famous ladder match.  This match lived up to the standards expected from this type of match with both teams coming out strong here.

Casket Match: D'Angelo Dinero vs. Abyss - For weeks dating back to before the previous month's Turning Point PPV, Abyss was always pushing a casket around proclaiming to shove & bury Pope's career in it.  Pope came out more serious than we've seen him before here to the point where the fans were chanting what he had written on the back of his tights in ""Monster Killer!"" as he resorted to a street fighting style with Abyss relying heavily on punches while also at one point bouncing Abyss' head between knee shots & the guardrail.  Abyss was able to catch Pope at various times such as slamming him off the top rope onto the top of the casket while doing a heavy amount of headbutts & power throughout the match even to the point where he punched through the casket to low blow Pope.  This was a solid match but was just like the previous month where they were just missing something to make this match really click.

Submission Match: Samoa Joe vs. Jeff Jarrett - After the way Jarrett ""choked out"" Joe at the previous PPV along with Jarrett's new found ""love"" for MMA/submission wrestling, this was made into a submission match complete with Jarrett wearing MMA style gear of his feet being taped, wearing MMA style gloves & shorts instead of his usual ring attire.  Before the match in the backstage area, Gunner & Murphy attacked Joe causing him to injure his ankle in the process going into the match.  At various points early in the match, Joe was off his feet sitting on the mat daring Jarrett to attack him causing Joe to be able to reverse Jarrett's attacked into various holds like a keylock & armbar.  Jarrett resorted to ramming Joe's injured ankle to get an advantage then going for an anklelock but it wouldn't work for long as Joe was able to keep working over Jarrett with various moves like Dean Malenko's Texas Cloverleaf while also going back to Jarrett's arm with keylocks.  Gunner & Murphy came back out causing a distraction for Jarrett to again work over the anklelock to the point where Joe had no other choice but to tap.  This was one of those matches were if you aren't a big fan of submission wrestling then it's not for you as Joe was able to live up to his name of the ""Samoan Submission Machine"" by showcasing his various submission style while Jarrett got his character over in that he really didn't know as much as he throughout & put over that knew much when it came to MMA/submission wrestling (yet how many years has he been using a figure four leglock?) & had to resort to the heel Jarrett of old in relying on heavy outside interference to get the victory.

No Disqualification Match w/Special Referee - Mr. Anderson : TNA Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Morgan - After the issue with the referee in at the Turning Point PPV, Morgan won the right to pick Mr. Anderson as the referee for this match.  Morgan dominated Hardy early with his power & size with moves like the discus clothesline & side slam before he hurt his leg after a carbon footprint & further hurt it when blocking Hardy's swanton.  Hardy tried walking out of the match (since No Disqualification doesn't mean that he still couldn't get counted out) & physically provoked Anderson to throw him back in into the ring & later taking his time when attempting to count Morgan.  In the end, Anderson was taken out of the contest thanks to both Hardy & Bischoff before the same referee that Immortal has been having problems with for the previous month was forced to make the three count after a third Twist Of Hate but this time on the steel chair.  This match was better than their match the previous month with Morgan again showing the he was so close to the TNA Title while the story of Mr. Anderson being the referee playing out well.

Turning Point had some good matches (Mickie/Tara, 3D/Guns, RVD/Dreamer) but for the most part was about pushing & continuing storylines with as Immortal's dominance throughout the night.  The first two hours of Final Resolution was one of the strongest performances from TNA this year with the gimmick matches providing better quality overall than the previous contest.  Overall, this is something I'd check out.",1292803200,,18065,4.49877750611247
