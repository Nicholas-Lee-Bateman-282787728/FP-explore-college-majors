8283288,3,B001BJ0UJA,"Starring: David `The Rock' Nelson and cast of dozens of quasi-celebs !
Chris Kahler and Franklin Wales bring us insight into what makes ""The Rock' tick.
David Nelson is unique in drive and ambition and mind you `Makes No Excuses !'
Gotta admire this man's camera shooting and `Hutzpah' to attack celebs for their cameos in his Poverty Row projects on video.
Nelson loves to talk and could be considered a `Verbal Train Wreck' of film knowledge.
The editing and patience are very entertaining and make him almost `Linear'.
The rift between Conrad Brooks and Nelson is hinted at,But never discussed.
Amazing documentary of a filmmaker who doesnt piss any different than Ed Wood or Larry Buchanan.",1271376000,,694,4.94017094017094
