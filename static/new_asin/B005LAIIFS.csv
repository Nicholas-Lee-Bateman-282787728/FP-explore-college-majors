4791250,5,B005LAIIFS,"I took my grandchildren to see this movie at the theater and they were completely taken in by it! We, adults were captivated as well. Awesome movie!!! I want to see it again and again!!",1354838400,43,185,4.314285714285714
4791251,5,B005LAIIFS,"You know that moment when the reporter tells Virginia that there is a Santa Claus, because it's the belief in goodness and love and togetherness that matters, not what the other kids in the playground are saying? That's where this movie lives- in that time when you know that nothing bad will ever happen to you because of the guardians out there, be they religious, mythical or familial, between you and the monsters.

Jack's adventure is nothing particularly new, and I found Chris Pine's voiceover a little jarring at first because he has such a deep voice for such a young creature, but that changes through the story as they add a little darkness to him. Also, this movie is NOT scary, and if your kid is scared by it you should probably expose him or her to more than they're being exposed to now. Just as Pine's voice grew on me, I came to love the multiculturalism represented by the other voices.  The fact that the guardians are not all American makes the story a little more universal.

My favorite touch? Definitely the elves.",1354752000,3,1038,4.6
4791252,4,B005LAIIFS,"I went to the multiplex with no expectations...having been generally disappointed with Hollywood offerings this year.  I was very pleasantly surprised how outstanding this film is.

It is among the most spectacular computer generated animations ever created...every time the multi-colored tooth fairy shows up on the screen (or her baby fairies) I smiled.  And that is the point of this movie..it makes you smile. ""Wings up, Ladies!"" (Yes, this is one of those movies that the BIG SCREEN and HIGH DEFINITION enhance enjoyment).  I believe that the astonishing look of the film has something to do with Guillermo del Toro, executive producer - because he is the man responsible for ""Pan's Labyrinth"", the film that changed the rules on Computer Animation in movies and made an indelible impression on world wide audiences.

A perfect movie for children - with no annoying bathroom humor - a (religious?) battle between good and evil that is not too dark. No one gets killed or wounded because the matter in controversy is the quality of dreams.  My favorite character is Santa Claus - with gang tattoos of ""naughty"" on one arm and ""nice"" on the other. Instead of the usual stereotype, he turns out to be Russian or Ukrainian.  We know this from his accent and expressions (When upset, he will say something like ""Shostakovich""). And...part of the fun is that Santa uses Abominable Snowmen to make the toys rather than the elves who don't do much work at all. The purpose of the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and Santa Claus is to bring hope, cheer, and wonder to children.  Enter  - - - Jack Frost --- who has not taken sides yet. Like so many of us, he is seeking the answer to why he is here on earth... his spiritual journey is the core of the film and his quest will determine the childrens' fate.

The characters are adorable, perhaps even the villain (The Bogeyman) was once himself.  The reason he has decided to change happy dreams to frightening ones derives from his loneliness.  He believes dark dreams is a way to achieve recognition....alas, an unhappy characteristic that is a dangerous one in our times.  Our heroes, or shall I say superheroes, won't allow that since their mission as GUARDIANS is to protect the children always.

Hey, let's get a real family movie for the kids..not ""Bad Santa.""  This is a wonderful choice. Friendly warning:  The beginning of the movie is very important so don't miss the first few minutes.",1354579200,2,2454,4.793349168646081
4791253,4,B005LAIIFS,"Reimagine Santa with a Russian accent and sleeve tats, the Easter Bunny with lethal boomerang skills, and a Tooth Fairy and a Sandman to match. Pit them against the evil Bogeyman, in his attempt to replace them all and permeate the world with his own dark influence. Now throw in Jack Frost - the unknown, suddenly promoted from the minor league.

Well, it's enough of a premise for an exicting kiddie flick, with plenty of heroics and very little in the truly frightening vein. Happy ending, of course. Not much for the grownup who paid for the tickets, though.

4791254,5,B005LAIIFS,"I would recommend it for anyone of any age! It was entertaining, funny, and very memorable. Also, they artwork and animation was impossibly fantastic.",1353888000,8,150,5.291666666666667
4791255,4,B005LAIIFS,"What if Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and Jack Frost teamed up to defeat an evil force that conspires to corrupt the children of the world?  The answer is something close to ""The Avengers, but with Holiday figures"" and is just as entertaining, leading to one of the year's most surprisingly good films.

In a world where the world's most famous holiday figures work to protect children and keep them happy, a great threat has emerged...a mysterious figure known as Shade, who seeks to destroy the guardians and the children they protect.  The guardians' only hope is to enlist mythical figure Jack Frost...but even together, can they turn the tide against a world that may no longer believe in them?

Despite the marketing campaign that portrays Guardians as a typical, sugar-coated cartoon for the kiddies (and in some ways it is, with lots of jokes, bright colors, and a message about the magic of believing), what's most surprising is the adult themes hidden within the rather-simple story, revolving around an exploration of faith and belief in things you can't see.  The main character, Jack Frost, is the perfect anti-hero: he may be mischievous and fun-loving, but beneath it all is a confused individual who spends most of the film begging an unseen deity for answers: Why am I here?  What's my purpose?  Why did you create me?  His search for answers provides Guardians with a powerful emotional core, one that anyone who has struggled with faith can perfectly relate to.

While the story is simple, and at times isn't exactly clear on the rules of it's universe (such as what happens to individuals when nobody believes in them) kids will no doubt be excited by all the action and jokes on screen, and adults will find a lot to keep their interest with the grown-up tones, making Guardians one of the biggest surprises of 2012.  Don't let the kiddy look fool you: this is a film with charm, and some genuinely heart-warming moments that stand equal with Pixar at their best.",1353715200,5,2009,4.797101449275362
4791256,4,B005LAIIFS,"You probably expect to see Santa at Christmas, but the Easter Bunny? Why not. Rise of the Guardians is a fun, behind-the-scenes look at the brotherhood of mythical creatures who protect and bring joy to children. In a way, their protection of kids is for their own good, too: they need the belief of kids in order to survive.

There are fun moments in the movie: we learn that the Yeti make the toys at the North Pole, instead of elves. In a funny clip during the end credits, we even learn the one of the Yeti's given names is ""Phil."" Sandman is one of the funniest characters in the film, despite being mute.

There are also scary moments: The Boogieman sends nightmares into the world in an attempt to take away children's hope. He is visually striking: nearly monochromatic in an otherwise colorful world, and accompanied by swarms of black horses worthy of the Ringwraiths.

*Spoiler Alert*

There is hope: Children are able to defeat the Boogieman by facing and acknowledging frightening circumstances, and choosing not to be afraid of them. This is where the ""wishful thinking"" part of my title comes in. Bravery is a good virtue to commend to children, but some kids have been through traumatic circumstances in real life. They might not be able to just ""choose"" not to be afraid.

*end of spoiler*

Overall, Rise of the Guardians is a fun movie; it's worth your time, and will probably make your young kids laugh, shriek, and laugh again. Just make sure you're there for the scary parts.",1353628800,3,1496,4.669201520912548
4791257,5,B005LAIIFS,"""Rise Of The Guardians"" is an uplifting movie revolving around how child-like wonder ties into the various holiday themes of occasions such as Christmas and Easter. Obviously, many people are going to come away with different interpretations of the movie.  For me, I saw a positive message of how beliefs play a powerful role in life and that every person has a spiritual purpose to fulfill in their life (regardless of their level of popularity and/or prestige).  ""Rise Of The Guardians"" is a good film for those who enjoy cheerful animated movies with prevalent holiday themes.",1353542400,8,579,5.020833333333333
4791258,4,B005LAIIFS,"Ever since ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" comic (not the movie), I've been intrigued by the basic premise: legendary characters from other genres are given the superhero treatment and then brought together under unlikely circumstances to face a global threat.  This structure is the standard plot of just about every Avengers and Justice League comic, but only recently -- perhaps a sign of the times -- has cobbling together a diverse cast of characters become movie entertainment.

""Rise of the Guardians"" continues the trend by turning the dial on iconic characters like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman up to 11. Each of these characters gives a gift to children, which in turn causes the children to believe in them and bestows a form of immortality. It's an oddly parasitic relationship that was prominent in Wizard of the Coast's ""The Primal Order"" supplement, in which deities need worshippers to gain power. Our heroes may not be all that powerful, but they are certainly popular.  At least some of them are.

One of the questions weighing on my mind in bringing my five-year-old to this film was how ""Rise"" would deal with Santa Claus. It's one thing to question the existence of the Tooth Fairy (I never liked her anyway), the Easter Bunny (does anyone believe he exists?), and the Sandman (pretty sure NOBODY believes he exists)...but Santa Claus?  That's some tricky turf right there.

Parents needn't worry.  Santa is a jovial, dual saber-wielding slavic warrior full of wisdom, jolly humor, and generosity.  As voiced by Alec Baldwin, this is a Santa I can get on board with!

The Sandman doesn't speak, but he pantomimes through thought-forms that lend themselves well to 3-D viewing.

The Easter Bunny is voiced by Hugh Jackman, which seems oddly natural.  He's a combative, boomerang-wielding humanoid rabbit that can throw egg-smoke bombs like a ninja.  He's also pretty adorable.

Isla Fisher (yes, the nymphomaniac from ""Wedding Crashers"") plays the Tooth Fairy as a neurotic workaholic who has been ""out of the field"" for so long that she no longer knows how to relate to kids. She also moons over Jack Frost (Chris Pine, AKA Captain Kirk).

Frost is the teenager of the bunch, frustrated by his lack of fame which makes him literally invisible to children.  Frost is on a personal journey to discover how he became who he is and in doing so, accepting his role as a new Guardian of children.

And that's what ""Guardians"" is secretly all about: aging gracefully into parenthood.  The older adults (the existing Guardians) worry about being forgotten, uninvolved in their children's lives.  Pitch the Boogeyman (voiced by an unctuous Jude Law) craves attention so much that he would be happy to just be feared because it means he will be remembered.  And Frost has to deal with his own childhood before he can become a parent.

There are some amazing set pieces, plenty of clever quips, and enough magical battles to keep the movie clicking along.  But Frost is something of a bland catch-all for every rebellious ""cool kid"" in the history of movies (he wears a hoodie, he MUST be cool!) and his big revelation about his past isn't much of a revelation at all. ""Rise of the Guardians"" is clearly just getting beginning to launch a franchise, and this is a good start. But I'll take a movie about just good ole sword-swinging Claus any day.",1353456000,115,3400,4.878260869565217
4791259,4,B005LAIIFS,"It seems Holiday films can be seen almost anywhere, but few are as fun and heartfelt as Dreamworks, 'Rise Of The Guardians'. I was attending a Dreamwork's screening and it was director Peter Ramsey (Monster Vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space) who took the book by William Joyce and the wonderful screenplay by David Lindsay-Abaire (Oz The Great and Powerful, Robots) and made a really passionate film about the various Holiday Icons and their familiarity with each other and why they are all forced to save the children of the world in one night or two.

Leading the cast, and explaining his backstory, is the voice of Chris Pine (Star Trek 2009, Unstoppable) playing the always present but never noticed Jack Frost. The story begins and ends with him learning about who he really is, what he is capable of and what lies in the center of his being that literally saves all the children of the world.  Jack has a very real emotional arch that I think kids are really going to sympathize with and understand why the Man In the Moon chose him as the next Guardian. (Of the children of the world.)

Producer Christina Steinberg (Bee Movie, National Treasure) says, ""Working with the cast was amazing. The time and creativity they put into their characters brought them colorfully to life. Really better than what we expected. These actors transformed themselves into these characters.""

Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, Rock of Ages) is the voice of North (otherwise known as S. Claus) who has the task of convincing not only Jack of his purpose in life and meaning for becoming a Guardian for the children of the world, but he has to convince his fellow teammates that Jack is worthy of the Man In The Moon's choice - to be another Guardian.

Ilsa Fisher (Wedding Crashers, Rango) is the voice of Tooth (or the Tooth Fairy) who really needs help from all her fellow Guardians and especially Jack who sees the real meaning of each tooth that the Tooth Fairy takes. She is so warm and friendly and there is an effervescent charm in her and her little fairies that help her.

Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Le Miserables) plays Bunny (or also known as the East Bunny) who has an accent, an attitude and a real issue with Jack joining their exclusive group. However, by the end of the film - Jack and Bunny end up being truly the very best at what they do.

Now add the element of the bad guy, Pitch Black, voiced sinisterly by Jude Law (Sherlock Holms, I.E.) and you have one of the scariest and meanest villains in the realm of animation films. He's mean and hurtful and he and Jack have an amazing showdown at the end that will warm your heart. There is even the character of The Sandman that has no dialogue but speaks through pictures made by piles of sand and he is hysterically funny doing it.

Executive Producer and creative consultant Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labrynth, Hellboy) says, ""I loved what the story was developing into. It was really alive and filled with great visuals. The details from the cast and their passion were amazing to watch. I think kids of all ages will love this film!""

`Rise of the Guardians' is a real adventurous film with color, style and the most amazing animation which works well both in 2D and even better in 3D. Most importantly it has an excellent story with a real heart at its center and it will make you feel good after seeing it. Bring everyone in the family to see this one.",1353369600,6,3409,4.575409836065574

As a mom, I appreciate the fact that this film is free of the crudeness and potty talk that most kids' movies are riddled with.

By way of caution, the ""bad guy"" in this story could be a bit too scary if your child is very sensitive.  Nothing gruesome or violent, but could still be scary for little people nonetheless.",1521158400,,441,4.826666666666667

4791547,5,B005LAIIFS,"These days to find a movie with comedy, action,and magic is hard , but the Disney Pixar movie, Rise of the Guardians has it all. Long ago, there was a boy. And the first thing the boy remembers is the darkness. That is, until he sees the moon. The moon tells the boy what his name is, Jack Frost. 300 years ago, not one believe in him, so to them Jack Frost was invisible. 300 years later, after the moon told the four guardians Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, and Sandman, that the villain Pitch Black or the boogie man wanted to be believe in. Which is bad because he wanted to scare the children of the world. The moon said that they need help and said Jack Frost has to be another guardian, but Jack refuses to be a guardian. Pitch Black first strikes the tooth palace and makes the tooth fairy not believed in, then he goes for the Sandman because the Sandman was the main reason why Pitch  was not believed in. The guardians started to get weak as the kids stopped believing in them. But at the end, Jack Frost finds a way to defeat Pitch, save the guardians, and make the children believe again, and becomes a guardian himself.

Rise of the Guardians was a movie with many surprising moments as well as many laughs. I enjoyed the movie because it kept me laughing and in suspense, I also love a movie with a little magic as well. The comedy scenes had me laughing and giggling a lot.

I had a lot of fun watching this movie and reminded me of my life as well. The movie was also showing that when you believe in something, especially in the guardian, people will think you're childish, but if you stop believing, not only does it affect you but may affect someone else as well.(such as the guardians). This movie was amazing and anyone who watches this movie will have fun and will be laughing a lot.",1519603200,,1815,4.316715542521994

4792172,5,B005LAIIFS,"You know all of those movies which try to do some sort of council of immortals, like Santa, the Easter Bunny, etc.? This movie actually does it WELL. The acting, the plot, the animation--everything about this movie is first rate. The only thing they did wrong was the marketing. I can't believe it took us so long to hear about this movie. It was a hit with little ones as well as adults in our household.",1500681600,,405,4.342105263157895
4792173,5,B005LAIIFS,"I fondly remember all those holiday cartoons and movies as a kid. And that joy I felt watching them unfold and delight in the stories and they joy, well of being a child. I was suprised at how much this movie brought that back. I'd give it more then 5 stars if I could. This was a treasure, and I'm sure I'll be watching it many more times in the future.

Hope? check. Joy? check. Laughs? check. I can't think of anything more you want from a movie. This was simply awesome. Young and old alike. pull off those tethers of time and responsibility that weigh on the shoulders are you get older, and just enjoy the delight in this show.",1499731200,2,633,4.231404958677686

4792249,5,B005LAIIFS,"We LOVE this movie.  I have 2 boys (5 and 7) and we just watched it for the first time 3 nights ago.  We've now watched 3 times since then.  Every few minutes, my 5 yr. old says, ""this is my favorite part!""  And he means it.  My boys generally don't like movies where there's no ""action"" and this one made them very happy.

The characters are the best thing about this movie.  Not exactly your typical representations of people like Santa and the Easter Bunny, but great depictions, nonetheless.  Santa's workshop is as magical a place as you would want it to be, and Santa retains all of his joy- but adds a significant helping of old world warrior on top of that.  Hugh Jackman's Easter bunny is also great.  My boys didn't love the tooth fairy as much as they loved everyone else, but they still liked her.  Sandy (Sandman) is another favorite, and Jack Frost is Peter Pan with ice powers.

They balance the story's conflict with a great deal of humor- my boys ADORE the elves and the yetis.  Overall, this is a great movie for family movie night and while we rented it to begin with, we now own it. (I predict many, many more viewings of this for our family.)  So sad that this didn't get the attention it deserved when it first came out in theaters and that there's no sequel.  Give it a try- you'll love it.",1498435200,,1313,4.302040816326531

4792322,2,B005LAIIFS,"A very unremarkable movie. My youngest children liked it and it was appropriate for all viewers but story-wise it was lame is most respects to anyone over age ten. Plot had too many holes that left no sense. For instance, if no one can see Jack Frost because no one believes in Jack Frost where did people get the expression ""Jack Frost nipping at your nose,"" to begin with? I mean, wouldn't someone have had to seen him to learn his name and associate him with Frost. Where did Frost come from before he showed up since there obviously was winter before him? What about santa, Easter Bunny and tooth fairy, were they all humans who died saving someone and was rewarded by the moon with immortality? Did they also wander aimlessly around d the world until people realized they existed? Is there some unknown face of April Fool's Day?",1493164800,,833,4.56

4792468,5,B005LAIIFS,"As a full grown adult, I still love watching Pixar and Dreamworks kid movies. This one is an insanely creative approach to all of your favorite childhood myths. I love that Santa is a giant Russian with full sleeve tattoos, that the Tooth Fairy actually resembles a hummingbird, and that Jack Frost is just a kid. The Sandman is one of the coolest characters I've ever seen in terms of his powers, and it's always impressive when there is a character that is beloved but doesn't say a word. I love the animated movies that think about the little details too. I get a serious kick out of the Easter bunny when he shrinks because you can see his tiny quick breathing, and it adds a really amusing touch. The story is refreshing and has the perfect mix between scary, funny, and hopeful. It leaves you feeling like you should be a kid again and believe in all of these myths.

4793057,3,B005LAIIFS,"I don't know what I don't like more... the character models or the story.

I will say the saving grace is totally the Easter Bunny but outside of that ... the rest of the characters are poorly designed (Jack Frost is a homeless bum, the Tooth Fairy looks like something out of Peter Pan's nightmares)... seriously, the main villein is the Boogy Man and his face just looks like a muppet and Odo from Deep Space Nine had a love child.  The opening where he is trying... So somehow the main plot is the Boogyman has somehow convinced every kid in the world to stop believing in Santa, Easter, Tooth Fairy ... and this somehow causes them to lose their powers ... except ... it doesn't ... as Jack Frost has been forgotten and he is doing just fine when he is called on.... so yeah, that doesn't make much sense ... I get that they were messing with the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny .. but somehow this cascades into children not believing in all the rest of the guardians as well???  I could forgive the nonsense plot if the character designs weren't so distracting to look at ....",1482796800,,1083,4.378109452736318

4793169,4,B005LAIIFS,"Having no relation to Legend Of The Guardians which came out just two years before this, Rise Of The Guardians was a film adaptation of The Guardians Of Childhood book series by William Joyce. It's basically an imaginary characters version of the Avengers with Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy protecting the children of the world from evil.

We open up with the creation of Jack Frost rising from a frozen pond, learning he can fly and control ice, but that no one can see or hear him. Cut to three centuries later, Jack is brought to the North Pole by Santa's hired good squad of yetis to be inducted into the group of the Guardians, individuals chosen by the mysterious Man in the Moon to defend kids from the newly arisen Pitch Black(aka: The Boogeyman). Pitch learns how to manipulate the Sandman's power to create dark horses called Nightmares to torment children's dreams, while at the same time attacking the Tooth Fairy's domain and stealing all the collected children's teeth which contain all their earliest memories. Jack is tempted by Pitch who bribe's him with his old teeth to recover the memories of his past life, but ends up loosing to him in a fight after Pitch had sabotaged Easter(we had to give the Bunny some reason to be in this story aside from whining about how more popular Christmas is!). Jack recovers and brings the Guardians back together with the last few children on Earth who still believe they exist to have a final conflict with Pitch and rescue the world from darkness.

This was a fine addition to the Dreamworks catalog, although it was the last one so far that they did for Paramount. Background painter Peter Ramsey did a fine job directing this as his first full-length animated feature. The voice acting is okay, although Alec Baldwin does a lousy Russian accent as Santa(you know, like in the storybooks!), and for some reason the Easter Bunny is an Aussie played by Hugh Jackman. It does feature some unique character designs, and above average CGI animation. For sure makes for a good watch for the kids at any given time of year, although to show it at X-Mas or Easter doesn't hurt either.",1482364800,,2159,4.693931398416886

After borrowing it from the library several times, I decided it was a new classic movie that we just need to own. The whole family enjoys the magical experience you get from watching it. The animation and plot are great. Even after multiple viewings, it still keeps us engaged throughout the whole movie.

I would not consider it a seasonal movie as it covers holidays such as Christmas and Easter and other childhood characters such as the Tooth Fairy, Mr. Sandman (awesome btw), and Jack Frost. It does have a boogeyman scene that may be too much for some young viewers. When my daughter was four she felt a little scared through that scene during her first viewing but once she got passed that part of the movie she was just fine. She did not experience any boogeyman dreams afterward either. (She had never heard of the boogeyman before this movie).

Undeniably a classic, watchable all year long though definitely timely during the fall and winter seasons, and renews the wonder and magic in all who watch it.",1479686400,6,1187,5.376344086021505

Unfortunately he has regrouped, and is corrupting the Sandman's dreams for his own purposes.  They are informed by the Man in the Moon that they will require help from a fifth Guardian - Jack Frost.  This is fine with all of them except Bunny, who still has a bone to pick with him for causing an Easter blizzard back in '68.  Getting Jack on board will not be that easy though, as he has been abandoned for 300 years without a clue as to his purpose and prefers goofing off with children to any serious work.  With Pitch on the move, they don't have the luxury of much time to integrate Jack into the team...

The visuals are stunning, from North's workshop which doubles as the team's situation room to Bunny's Miyazaki inspired warren and the special effects of Jack's frost and the light and dark dream sand utilized by Sandy and Pitch respectively.  Just as good are the story and voice acting.

Imagine the Jack in the old Rankin-Bass special injected with a sassy attitude and you'll pretty much have Chris Pine's take on the character.  He's a prankster who adores children but has also been deeply scarred by being a naturally gregarious person suffering an enforced isolation - eternally caught in a physical age where he isn't a boy anymore but isn't quite a man yet either.  Isla Fisher plays Tooth with alternating girlish hyperactivity and maternal empathy, with something vaguely hummingbird-like thrown in.  Alec Baldwin clearly has a ball running with the concept of Santa as an over-the-top wild and jolly Cossak.  Sandman is voiceless (can't wake the children, nach), but his big scenes pack a huge punch.  The children they interact with are not irritating, but on the contrary quite effective proxies for the children watching the movie.

The two characters who really steal the movie, however, are Pitch and Bunny.  Pitch is reprehensible, and does at least one thing we see that is unredeemable, but is also sympathetic and almost reasonable in some ways.  He's emphatically what Jack could be should he choose to go in another direction - which will cause half of the movie's tension.  Jude Law's smooth delivery makes him all the more creepy.  Finally there's Hugh Jackman's exasperating but wonderfully endearing Bunny who alternates between being a kick-butt Aussie bruiser and an embodiment of fragile yet powerful nascent regeneration and warmth who occasionally displays a skittishness reminding you that he's a rabbit.  Jackman's affection for the character shines through, and he gives Bunny the strongest character development save Jack himself.

I would probably caution parents of younger children to preview, as some of the scenes involving Pitch and his Nightmares can be scary and the big reveal of Jack's blocked-out memory - hinted at in the prologue - is quite disturbing in spite of being presented as tactfully as possible.  In general though, this is a wonderful movie for animation fan of all ages.  If the power and quality of the writing could be maintained and the voice cast reassembled, I would look forward to a sequel or two.",1472515200,,3336,4.919642857142857

I vaguely remember a preview for this when it came out, but it largely flew under my radar.  On its own, it is as good as some of the better CG animation.  Its funny, it has good story telling.  The visuals augment these to great ability. This is all to be expected with Pixar or Dreamworks.  What really sets this apart is the 3d.  Lots of panorama, tons of perspective.  Explosions and little magical sparkles pepper the foreground. The movie has lots of movement and action, BUT not jarringly so. If you are purchasing with 3d in mind, this movie will be one of the ones that will put a smile on your face and remind you what it is to be a kid again.

4795621,4,B005LAIIFS,"Watched this movie last night, and then rewatched it twice. Will probably watch it again tonight as well. This is a very enjoyable, heartwarming story with fun characters, a good protagonist, and a very creative story.

It's not perfect, by any means - the animation, while often a joy to look at, is hardly on-par with Pixar's. While Santa and the Easter Bunny, and later Jack, are revealed to have really important things about childhood that they represent and guard, that actually make sense given their historical meanings, and the Sandman doesn't state his reasons (naturally), but you can kind of guess, the Tooth Fairy's justification for being a Guardian was clearly just cobbled together by the writers. And...

...Ok, I really need to say something about the ""Snow Day"" that they show us in Jack's first post-credits scene. :) Admittedly, it's been a long time since I was a child, but I remember the term, ""snow day,"" meaning, ""a day with no school because the administration closed schools, either because the roads were impassable, or because it was deemed too cold for children to go outside for any length of time."" What we were shown in the movie could, with great generosity, have been called, ""light flurries."" They showed barely a half an inch of snow on the ground. This was in the northern US (we saw it on the map later on, and Jamie talks about Michigan not being too far away)... how is that a ""snow day?"" If administrations anywhere north of Oklahoma called off school for that little snow, there would be no school from November through March! And even if they're just referring to a day where there is snow... it's nearly Easter! How is that teensy amount of snow, which is barely enough for a child to even do anything with, grounds for celebration? Right now, as I write this, we've had a heat wave here, and snow has been melting all day, and there's more snow left on the ground right now than there was in the movie right after the snowfall!

(Sorry... that was just something that leapt out at me when I was watching. I imagine it leapt out to children watching as well, provided that those children don't live south of Oklahoma. It was actually *confusing* to me... I couldn't figure out why those kids were calling it a snow day.)

But that's just a minor nitpick, at the end of the day. :) All told, this was a great story with great action, story, and heart, and I'm glad I saw it.",1455840000,,2419,4.5796766743648964

4795995,1,B005LAIIFS,I would give this more stars but--yet again--we're showing our children that the way to solve problems is through physical violence. I would have been more impressed by a Santa Claus that brandished clever solutions rather than twin dueling swords or a tooth fairy that kills with kindness rather than punches teeth out. This could have been a clever device to illustrate how evil is destroyed when met with compassion (the only way evil truly is dispelled). Violence is evil; violence + more violence (even from the Easter Bunny) = more evil. Boo.,1453939200,,548,4.903225806451613

There are some scenes that might scare little ones who have bad dreams and in that case I would preview it. These scenes didn't bother my children at all...I think the Guardians are so powerful that they out shined the ""evil"" of the villain (the boogie man - named Pitch Black)).

Our childhood stories were not just to entertain us and help our parents to instill good habits in us.  They meant something deeper.  Something that we, as adults have forgotten, even as we pass it on to our young ones.  The power of wonder, hopes, and dreams, memories, and fun are all the things we left behind as we grew up.

When the evil spirit Pitch launches an assault on Earth, the Immortal Guardians team up to protect the innocence of children all around the world.

What did I think?

While very clever, the storyline in this animated flick is more for adults than children. Not to say they won't enjoy it, but its not something theyll rave about or even remember a day or two later. Interesting but not engaging. Grown-ups should find the plot intriguing and name-the-voice good fun.",1432166400,,483,4.795180722891566

4798479,4,B005LAIIFS,"I bought this for my 6 (nearly 7) year old daughter. Several of her classmates have seen it and their parents recommended it to me. She had 4 baby teeth pulled and I wanted to provide her with a treat that would keep her quiet for a while.

It is an animated super hero team movie with Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Sandman & Jack Frost as the ""Avengers."" It is fast paced, almost frantic at some points. The BoogieMan is the dark and sinister villain and he is scary! In the end, the good guys win with the help of children.

My daughter loved it but at some of the intense scenes she kind of hid her eyes. The ending is uplifting. I don't think I would show this to a child younger than 6 (first grade). I don't think a child younger than 3 could process the action enough to follow the story. Between 3 and 5 I can see this as something that nightmares are made of. But by 6, alone or in a group, the kids should enjoy it.

I also suspect that at 6 they will have things they want to talk about after seeing it. My daughter & I chatted a little after the movie. I suspect there will be more discussion on it soon (along with a repeat viewing).

Lots of extras and most of them are on the Blu-ray disc.

At $9.99 it is a great value. My digital copy code didn't work with Flixster or Ultraviolet. When I read the full text on the code paper it said something like, ""may not be valid after April 15, 2015."" I was able to redeem it directly into iTunes.

My husband and I didn't exactly like that Santa was tattooed all over his arms and carries swords and the Easter Bunny seemed a little scary but my son liked it and asked to watch it again. He will tell us if he thinks a movie is too scary and he doesn't want to watch it. I like that it includes the Tooth Fairy, Sandman, Jack Frost and reminds kids and parents to enjoy the magic of childhood. The Boogey Man was a bit scary too but he is defeated in the end and I like that my kids see the message that good defeats evil and that the bad guy doesn't win because they often want to play the bad guy in their imaginative play and I sometimes worry about that.

4800746,5,B005LAIIFS,"Rise of the Guardians is a very unique twist on modern myths.  The characters are a little more gritty than you would expect but it offers something new.  We found some parts a little creepy in regards to the villain, but very mild by comparison to some of the more recent fairy tale adaptations.  In just about every scene there is something to keep it lighthearted while maintaining a good moral center.  It is a movie you can definitely watch over and over and the kids and adults will love it just the same.",1418774400,,511,4.404255319148936

4801213,4,B005LAIIFS,"I didn't expect to like this as much as I did.  The story of Jack Frost being an impish Guardian in a host of fairy tale mythic characters (Santa, the Easter Rabbit, the Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy) who doesn't know who he is or why he's so important was artfully and vividly told.  The animation, especially on Blu-ray, is full of deep color and contrasts and the voice acting is decent.  The surprising scene stealer here is the silent and surprisingly powerful Sandman but the different take on all of these well-worn characters (especially Santa--what a bruiser!) makes this a memorable movie and fun for adults.  Pitch is an okay foil for our heroes to show their caliber and I can't help but believe that they can do better with a villain.  Maybe next time?  It may be a tad too dark for especially younger children (up to 4 or 5 you'd want to check it out yourself to see if your kids would be alright with it) but most should enjoy and even hope for a sequel.

4801215,5,B005LAIIFS,"I thought this was going to be hokey, but it turned out to be quite a treat. My young son is totally intrigued by this film, and his mother and I are, too. We talk about the messages of the movie--mostly that bad dreams can only scare you if you let them, and it seems to work for him. He does sleep well after watching the movie, so the message seems to work.

I think the takeaway for adults is that you need to be around kids to understand kids. Santa Claus' line sums it up, ""We are busy bringing joy to children. We don't have time for children!"" Maybe the upshot is that we need to spend less time worrying about our kids and more time actually being with them. It's something that we should think about every day.

All in all, this is a good movie so something for both adults and children.

Note: there are some scary parts to this film. The first time my son (5 yrs old) saw this, he was a little scared by the Boogey Man. Once we talked about it, it doesn't scare him any more. He watches it with fascination and even roots for the good guys now. Just beware that your child may be a bit frightened by it at first.",1416614400,,1124,4.076923076923077

4801530,3,B005LAIIFS,"There's a lot of action, and somewhat out of place moments of epic fighting that remind me of anime classics like dragon ball z.  Visually, the movie is impressive, as most Dreamworks movies are.  The voice acting was good, and there were some funny moments.

The plot and character stories aren't as good.  The fighting is a new twist on Santa Claus, the easter bunny and sandman; I never envisioned Santa as a warrior swinging a pair of swords around.  The main theme of defeating fear and nightmares gets kind of lost and wanders around from scene to scene; the focus shifts between that, Jack Frost's true identity and one child that still believes in the guardians.  And in between these mixed plot elements, there are long sequences of collecting teeth for the tooth fairy and trying to help the easter bunny get easter eggs hidden.",1415145600,,838,4.705479452054795

I want to mention that at times, the theme can be somewhat dark and I would wonder if it might scare some kids. Mine weren't bothered but I have two boys and their attention span is pretty short so I doubt they really ""saw"" all of the movie. They also have a portion of video where you can see someone dying, essentially. Again... maybe this is more my perspective as an adult and I'm more effected than a child would be.

4801581,4,B005LAIIFS,"2012s Rise of the Guardians represents the middle of three William Joyce books that were turned into CG animated feature films (the others being Disneys 2007 Meet the Robinsons and Blue Skys 2013 Epic) and is the only one to come from DreamWorks.

Unfortunately the film has the dubious distinction of losing money for the powerhouse studio- to the tune of an $83-million writedown for the quarter and the layoffs of 350 employees.  This sad event would occur a year later with release of the film Turbo.

Perhaps the biggest tragedy is that by no means is this trend the fault of the film itself.  Rise of the Guardians is a masterwork in the CG medium with remarkably interesting (if slightly miscast) characters, slick narrative, and a worthy moral inter-weaved tastefully throughout.

The story is primarily told through the perspective of an amnesic Jack Frost (Chris Pine) as he happens upon an ancient struggle for the power of belief from human children. When Pitch Black AKA The Boogeyman (Jude Law) resurfaces after being absent since the Dark Ages, humanitys last hope, The Guardians, must reunite to prevent the balance between fear and hope from becoming forever lost to darkness.  However, these Guardians are no mere mortals- comprised of Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and Sandman; the power of magic that comes from the belief of children everywhere is certainly on their side.

There has been some public dismay with the portrayal of some of these iconic characters here; particularly the Santa (Alec Baldwin) figure; given forearm tattoos (one arm representing naughty, the other nice), a Russian accent and a pair of swords and the Easter Bunny as indicated by a sarcastic, boomerang wielding sharp-tongued Australian (Hugh Jackman).

I would counter such complaints by reminding that we are being treated to a view of a rare side to these icons; that the core of this story is their value as resistance to the fear and darkness of doubt.  The jovial and good halfheartedness of each of the characters is never discounted here, so much as were simply given the added perspective of their no-nonsense sides in times of crisis.

That being said, the film paces magnificently well and delivers its narrative with conviction.  A few action segments feel a bit contrived so as to show off the muscle of their pixel-processing power/ potentially dazzle moviegoer with 3D effects, but as a whole the pieces of the film come together beautifully to make suspension of disbelief a very naturally occurring affair.

Then there is the look of the film.  While impressive visuals do not a good movie make; Rise is proof that they can make an already good film amazing.  DreamWorks accomplishes a feat here thats only been attempted successfully a couple of times in the past even by masters-of-the-art Pixar: Life-like human models.  So wonderful are the facial expressions and visual emotions of Jack Frost that at times it becomes easy to forget that what you are gazing upon is in fact just a computer graphic.  Additionally texture work is impeccable from the spreading of ice crystals to the golden and black grains of dream sand, truly this is a piece that could only have been done justice in CG rendering.

There is no getting around the fact that this is a DreamWorks film, though, as unlike say Pixar; who make it a habit of crafting intricate plots out of the simplistic and mundane, this one requires loads of exposition and dialog across nearly every frame to get its message through.  However, this is also only a film that DreamWorks could do properly; the weight of even one of the characters involved here is enough to send most filmmakers running, much less all of them bunched up into one tale.  Yet somehow the piece finds a pretty interesting balance between them all.

I would like to conclude this review on a slightly higher note than it began- while its true it was considered a financial bomb in the box office, it did eventually overcome its initial budget (though failed to make a return on the money DW sank in marketing & promotion).. It did, however, end up bringing in a very lucrative return once it came to small screens in DVD and blu-Ray form.  In fact, having cleared well over 5-million DVD unit sales by the end of 2013 alone, theres a good chance many of the laid-off employees were once again able to return to work.

All in all, Rise of the Guardians manages to deliver a lush and genuinely interesting fantastical world for adults and children alike to escape to for a solid hour-and-a-half.  A shame that its lackluster box-office performance is the most common association with the film because, when judged on its own merit, Rise of the Guardians is certainly a worthy entry in the CG animated feature film genre.",1414195200,,4784,4.83578431372549

4802047,5,B005LAIIFS,"There's something in this story for both adults AND children.  It was my favorite animated 3D film the year it was released.  Hugh Jackman, Chris Pine, Jude Law and Alec Baldwin lend their voice talents to an impeccably animated tale involving Santa Clause, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy and Jack Frost try to save the earths children from Jude Law's formidable ""Pitch"" (short for Pitch Black) who is out to steal the innocence from the children of the world.

4802095,5,B005LAIIFS,"It took me forever long to see this movie, and I blame the movie title. I'd sworn up and down I'd seen it before, the one about the owls, yeah? Rise of the Guardians underperformed at the box office. In fact, at the time, it was the lowest earning animated film debut for DreamWorks since Flushed Away. Released in November of 2012, Rise of the Guardians got buried in the box office onslaught of films like Skyfall, Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2, and Wreck-It Ralph. And maybe the marketing for it was too edgy and kept away the meeker families. What, a Sons of Anarchy tattooed biker Santa Claus? Back away, family.

Many, many years ago the mysterious Man in the Moon gazed down upon a drowning boy and plucked him from the icy fathoms. 300 years later, today, that eternal boy, Jack Frost, is still around. Jack, long stricken with amnesia, has no one to believe in him and this renders him invisible in human circles. Within the community of fables, he's garnered a rep for recklessness and irresponsibility. Jack is dedicated to having fun. What else is there when you walk the world unnoticed? Yeah, son, the film is far from subtle about laying down his emotional arc. He's our window into the story.

In the North Pole, three days before Easter, North's mind is on the Bogeyman. North - a.k.a. Santa Claus - frets that the malevolent Pitch Black - who's been kept at bay since the Dark Ages - may finally be on the move. The Bogeyman doesn't want much - just for the world to reflect the darkness and misery of what it's like to lurk under the bed scaring children. North looks to the Man in the Moon for guidance and so assembles the rest of the Guardians, those fellow avatars of imaginary folklore whose primary function is to watch over the children of the world. The Guardians comprise of North, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman... and, just now, Jack Frost. Yeah, someone should tell Jack Frost.

Except that Jack - grabbed by North's yetis, dumped in a sack, and abducted to the North Pole - ain't having it. Jack thinks being a Guardian is hard work and, remember, he's all about the fun. Still, when the Bogeyman launches his assault, he goes along for the ride. Sucker.

It's Edge of Tomorrow all over again. Someone seriously dicked around with Rise of the Guardians' advertising campaign. The title similarity to the owls movie aside, I think, more than anything, families who were thinking about seeing this took in the trailers, eyeballed the unconventional character designs and that Santa has tattoos and could pass for a bare knuckle brawler, and said ""No, thanks. We'll go see Wreck-It Ralph for the fourth time."" You can't tell me that the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and the Easter Bunny don't look weird. Moms and dads, when taking their kids to the theater, prefer to play it safe.

The thing of it is that, once you get past the daring concept designs and the postmodern takes, it's a traditional picture trotting out age-old family themes. And, it turns out, these are fantastic takes. The voice actors are familiar names, and while I still prefer a cast of no-names to handle the verbals, this bunch makes their characters relatable and fun. Alec Baldwin tries on a Russian accent for North, and it works and fits the expansiveness of his character. Hugh Jackman as the 6'1"" Australian Easter Bunny with a chip on his shoulder? Yes, please. And who knew Jude Law - as Pitch Black the Bogeyman - could inflect such velvet elegance into his vocals?

I love this shared universe and the fresh new mythology the film creates. I love that the Tooth Fairy treats her barter-tooth-for-coin as if she's on the NYSE trading floor, and yet she still has it in her to coo over a child's adorable lateral incisor. It's cute that Santa and the Bunny have a long-standing grudge stemming from which holiday they think is superior. It's a cute touch that it's the yetis who actually make the toys, and that Santa allows the elves to think they're the ones making them. The Sandman is the most loveable character. He's sweet and whimsical and doesn't speak ever but instead communicates by manifesting dream images over his head.

The pace is breakneck. The animation is nearly flawless. (I had some issues with how how the characters' hair was rendered stiffly.) Jack Frost in action may be my most favorite thing. Jack is breathtakingly acrobatic and is often carried aloft by his friend, the wind. And it's Jack - terrifically voiced by Chris Pine - who delivers the strongest emotional beats. Jack's moments of discovery - when he recovers his memory, when he finds his center - make for striking dramatic scenes.

I guess we'll never get a sequel now, and that sucks. I want more Jack Frost and company. I want more of this mythology. Piss-poor advertising has guaranteed a sequel will never see the light of day, and the Man in the Moon has called it a night.

Stick around for a fun stinger in the middle of the end credits.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- Filmmakers' audio commentary with director Peter Ramsey and producers Christina Steinberg and Nancy Bernstein (with optional commentary sub-titles in English, French, or Spanish)
- ""Dreamers & Believers"" - casting the film (00:10:46 minutes)
- ""Sandy's Dream Guide"" - a guide to interpreting the imagery in your dreams",1408924800,,5308,4.690655209452202

The Jack Frost character is a bit bland.  Jude Law does a good job as Pitch Black, as does Alec Balwin with Santa Claus as a Russian warrior type. As the original Santa was based on Odin anyhow a warrior makes sense.  As Santa was played as a Russian, I think we would have preferred to see him voice-acted by an actual Russian actor though (or would that make too much sense?).  Some of the action scenes with Frost early on are shown in too fast a speed, wiser to slow down the action to human levels so it can be better enjoyed.  Storyline was average.

4802712,5,B005LAIIFS,"Rise of the Guardians is a movie that truly stunned me.  After seeing the trailers for the movie, I had little interest in seeing this and only went with my little sister when she begged me.  But from the opening scene, I was absolutely hooked.  The trailers do this movie no justice and I strongly recommend not judging it on the trailers alone, because they portray a completely different movie than this turned out to be.

With a colorful and memorable cast of characters, giving new twists to figures we recognize from our childhoods, it's an experience that really reaches out to the child in us all.  These were characters I really connected with, especially Jack Frost who gives us that ""outsider's"" perspective of the world and introduces us to it.

Pitch Black is easily one of the more memorable villains in recent animated films, with a level of depth and complexity I don't normally see in bad guys for media aimed at children.

The movie is by no means perfect and the ending itself falls a little flat in some areas, as well as never really explaining how some things happened.  But the journey up to that point and even through it is really spectacular.  The script, voice acting, characterization, and animation are all top notch.

4802716,5,B005LAIIFS,"A very good kids movie- deals with loneliness, feeling invisible/ bullied, finding your purpose (only to discover you had been fulfilling it all along), and standing up to fear- literally.  I highly recommend this movie, but do be prepared to talk to your kids about some stuff afterwards- this movie presents santa, the tooth fairy, and the easter bunny as real at the same time it is presenting the boogeyman as real.

*Some Spoilers* This is the first kids movie I have seen in a long while in which I was really really hoping that the bad guy turned out to be... not good, exactly, but maybe an anti-hero.  I think they could have easily done it.  He can be easily identified with (his ultimate motivation behind his actions is to be believed in again, which incidentally is the same wish as the main character- Jack Frost) and, though his methods leave something to be desired, the idea of Fear being 'evil' is not actually true.  Fear is a motivator and a warning sign- and very necessary in a child's life to help prevent the reckless behavior that Jack seems to embody.  Really, Pitch and Jack are the most perfect opposites (fear and joy, cowardice and bravery) that I think it would have been very interesting to see them work together, though the story would have been very different.",1402876800,,1295,4.633187772925764
4802717,4,B005LAIIFS,"I wasn't prepared to like a story that has a sword fighting Santa with a Russian accent nor an Easter Bunny with an Australian accent, but the character of Jack Frost with Chris Pine gave a lot of humanity to this cute story.",1402704000,,225,4.255813953488372

4802799,4,B005LAIIFS,Rise of The Guardians Is amazing. Where else would You find a B A santa and a group of amazing beings coming together? Jack Frost had a neat background but I have to say the plot was a little bit weak. It needed more of an explanation about the moon because the ending statement jack made made it sound as if destiny was the main plot when it seemed to be more about finding oneself.,1400630400,,383,4.12

4802863,2,B005LAIIFS,"This is a strange mixed bag.  It's so unsexual that it's kind of perverse.  It's as if they worked really hard to take any kind of sensuality out of the characters because they deal with kids, so much so that it's noticeable.  The lead character's voice, Chris Pine, has the sexiest voice in the world.  Jack's face is beautiful, I mean, prettiest male face in an animation EVER.  However, he has the body of Jack from The Nightmare Before Christmas.  The tooth fairy is hideous.  She's more of a fish than a fairy.  Come on, FAIRY... I want to see big flowing hair and gossamer gowns and huge luminescent wings.  Nope, basically she's a fish bug in a leotard made from scales.  We won't even talk about the Sandman.  Jude Law as the villain?  I don't enjoy.  He's too good of a person to sound evil.  Baldwin and Jackman give excellent performances even though the writing is awkward.  I rate movies on how often I watch them, I LOVE to watch my favorite movies over and over... this one I've seen twice in over a year.",1400371200,,1020,4.408602150537634

4802944,5,B005LAIIFS,"My expectations for this movie were very low.  The story sounded completely silly, I had never intended to bother watching this.  But I kept seeing things online (mostly about Jack Frost) saying it was great.  So I rented it on AmazonPrime, hell, it was only a couple of bucks.  Only thirty minutes in, I looked down from the TV screen to my Amazon account and purchased it instead.  I've watched it twice in the last three days.  I had watched it the first time in a marathon of Dreamworks and Pixar movies on my day off, including 'Tangled', 'Brave', and the recent hit by Disney/Pixar, 'Frozen'  (why are all of Disney/Pixar's movies named with a adjective these days?).  'Rise of the Guardians' was my favorite by FAR.

The story is incredibly original, and the way the characters were portrayed is so incredibly unique.  Your antagonist, the Boogeyman, isn't your disgusting monster, but Pitch, whose demeanor kind of reminds me of Hades, from Disney's Hercules, only less...  flamboyant.  For your team of heroes brought together by the Man in the Moon, each representing a crucial piece of childhood, you do not get what you expect, either!  Forget your jolly old man in red, your fairy in a pink tutu and your fluffy white (or pink) Cadbury bunny.  You get a tough, Russian, scimitar-wielding Santa (Wonder), a very creative hummingbird Tooth Fairy (Memory), and a massive egg-bomb dropping, boomerang throwing Australian Easter Bunny (Hope).  The Sandman (Dreams) is endearing and Jack Frost (Fun) is such an incredibly executed character with a very touching (albeit sad) story, you can't help but love him and his flawed, eternally teenaged, humanity.

It's really a shame that this film underachieved at the box office, it truly is a magical masterpiece of ingenuity in its reinvention of such old, classic faces from our childhood.  It is now one of my absolute favorite movies, and Jack Frost, one of my absolute favorite characters.  It truly inspires you to believe again, in the greatest things in childhood...  Beyond the Fear, there is Hope, Memory, Dreams, Wonder...  and Fun.",1398470400,,2096,4.951289398280802

4802946,5,B005LAIIFS,"I love this movie, the comedy is just right, the story is perfect, and the design of this movie is AWESOME!!! My favorite character is Jack Frost not only can he control winter he also has a very dark background story. He dies saving his sister and they just say he died, THEY SHOW IT. He froze to death, which is a pretty depressing. And then he's brought back to life as Jack Frost, no memories of his family, sister, and his past. The Pit Blacks villain plane was flaws and for a moment I would have liked to see him win but only for a moment. The only problem I had with it was how Pit Black looked liked. He's spouse to be Oogie Boogie but he doesn't look scary, I thought he would look a little like Nightmare Before Christmas Boogie Man but he looks like a high, pedophile vampire who walked on to the wrong set. Every one else was designed wonderfully. Everyone looked like they took there time even for simple characters like the kids and the dark sleeping dust well created. You could tell they put a lot of time and effort in to all that. But Pit Black's character was simple and boring. And don't give me this ""its a kids movie, hes not spouse to look scary"". May I remind you that Jack Frost was killed by falling in to a frozen lake and freezing to death. That's pretty dark even for a kids movie. So why didn't they make him look a little scary. Not only that but what's with the Pitch black Name. Was Dark Heart (Care Bears movie 2) and black Heart (Ghost Rider movie 1) taken? I think you should have sicked to the Boogie Man. Besides all that its till a great movie the sound tracked was well composed and the plot especially Jack back ground story and his present story was well thought of. I recommend  that you buy this movie and watch it. You will not be disappointed.",1398384000,,1790,4.233918128654971

No spoilers here!!Just my opinion...totally worth the money for this movie!!!",1396051200,,263,4.076923076923077
4803071,5,B005LAIIFS,"That's the moral of this story in a nut-shell.  Religion is a controversial topic, but this movie manages to speak of the power of faith without bringing in the controversy.  Here  the Guardian angels of earth are not the various religious prophets of the various religions of the world... or even the ""guardian angels"" of Christian Faith of one wishes to see it that way.. no these guardians are Santa Claus, The Sand Man, Jack Frost, The tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny.  They have all come together to defeat doubt and fear- in the form of the Boogie Man.  Who of coarse is played by a Brit because as we all know by know by know every villian must be British. :)  Since most religions do not have a devil it makes more sense to see the Boogie Man as simply a representation of doubt.

Jack Frost like we humans, wants to know Why he is here.  He asks the Moon (which can easily be thought of as God) why he put him there, but the moon, like god does not answer him.  Instead the few times the Moon does speak it does so using signs rather than words.  The Guardians try to recruit Jack.  Their main function is protect the world by instilling and maintaining faith which helps to combat the doubt and fear that would otherwise rule people's lives.  Jack doesn't see how he can instill faith in others when no one has faith in him.  Santa tells him that he doesn't get to choose his role in this life because it is the moon that chose it for all of them including Jack.

At one point someone asks Jack how they can keep believing in the Guardians when they can't see them and Jack replies by asking 'When clouds cover the sun do you stop believing in the Sun?  Just because you can't see us doesn't mean we won't always be there.  And now we will always be inside of you... and that in a sense makes you a guardian too.'  This is a great film for teaching kids the power of faith and believing regardless of your religious affiliation.",1395792000,,1940,4.285714285714286

4803229,5,B005LAIIFS,"When I originally saw the trailers for this, I was underwhelmed. It wasn't until I saw more of the clips that I changed my mind. While I love animated movies, it isn't every movie that I am willing to see. I was actually moved by this one especially the scenes where Sophie accidently invaded the Easter Warren when she finds one of North's snow globes, and where Jack managed to keep a young boy from losing his belief in the Easter Bunny or the other Guardians. What surprised me was that none of the characters were like the standard beings that we have ever seen in all of the Christmas movies and holiday specials. Santa AKA North, is Russian, and a powerhouse with twin swords and tattooed arms, and with an army of Yetis to do his toy making while the Elves performed the lesser tasks. The Easter Bunny throws boomerangs, egg bombs and is 6ft 1"" tall with aboriginal markings and an Australian accent. The Tooth Fairy and her entourage looked more like hummingbirds while the Sandman was a silent golden mute who ""speaks"" in symbols and signs but wields a pair of sand whips when he fights. This is more a story of Jack Frost finding himself while helping the other Guardians confront and defeat Pitch Black, a villain who intends on filling the entire world in darkness and fear by harnessing the dreams of children and turning them to nightmares. Pitch is indeed a menacing figure, one who tries to convince Jack to join him in his conquest, preying on his doubts and fears while Jack realizes that only by fulfilling his destiny as a Guardian can he find what he's really seeking within himself. While this concerns Santa and Jack Frost, I do not consider this a Christmas movie, but a good holiday picture, one that speaks a little more to the heart than most.",1393632000,,1771,4.554858934169279

4803232,5,B005LAIIFS,"Santa, The Easter Bunny, the Sandman, The Tooth Fairy all in one movie defending childhood dreams with their new recruit Jack Frost. Not bad and a nice way of writing about these characters that isn't clich or trite. I like this movie if only for Jack's journey discovering who he is and why he matters, a journey we've all made.
This is a good solid fairy tale that doesn't talk down to kids, especially when they show children have more power than they think, especially when it comes to protecting their right to dream.
Good voice cast, and for many, Jack is a hottie.",1393372800,,571,4.5
4803233,3,B005LAIIFS,"I had rented this before but wanted to have it in my collection.  The illustration in blu-ray was gorgeous, and all the actors' voices were in tune with their characters' quirks.  Fast paced and great fun, except Pitch's extended ""little boy lost - why am I here"" theme dragged on too long.",1393372800,,290,4.5576923076923075

4803282,5,B005LAIIFS,"This is SUCH a great film....artistic, well plotted, and technically superior to most animated films.  It is as much a message to adults as to children as to our responsibility to be ""guardians fierce and true!"" LOVE it!!!",1392595200,,222,4.842105263157895

4803378,3,B005LAIIFS,"It was a decent movie. Fairly clich, but what kid movie isn't? I usually decide how good these are based on how well it keeps the attention of my three year old. This one didn't really captivate him. I think I had to end up buying it because it wasn't available for rent. I'll have to see if my five year old likes it better.",1392249600,,325,4.015384615384615

We didn't have any problems playing it the sound and video quality were all where they should be for a Blu-ray and it comes with the 3D and DVD version so if you don't have a Blu-ray player yet you cant watch the DVD version.,1391904000,,341,4.029411764705882

4803443,5,B005LAIIFS,"I'm not going to go on a rambling spiel about why this movie is so good, but I will say that you would be hard press to find another animated movie that has so many layers to it.  It's happy, it's sad, it's beautiful, it's fun, it's touching, it's inspirational.  I know the author of the books deserves the credit for the interpretation of these mythic figures, but the movie really brings them to life in an excellent way.  They are both familiar and yet strangely odd and refreshing in ways you might not have thought of them before.  Enjoy!",1391212800,,544,4.41

4803445,5,B005LAIIFS,"i've seen this movie a few times and finally decided to buy it. it's so beautiful! the graphics, the re-imagining of the characters... EVERYTHING! it's a beautiful movie with delightful designs and i was more impressed with how they changed up classic characters so much.

although this isn't a christmas movie (hell, it's set a few days before easter) i feel like it was an excellent movie for the holidays. scratch that, it's a perfect movie for anytime of the year. the villain was lightly in the story enough to set up suspense and often times they used his shadow as a use for fear. the protagonist is a loner looking for his place among his lost existence. what i love is how similar the two characters have alike. jack loves having fun and good times with kids (that doesn't sound as bad as it reads, i swear), and pitch loves having a fun and good time with kids in his own twisted way (again... not that way). in an odd way, the movie leads you to think that these two are in an odd yin yang formation and for a moment leads you to think that they could possibly enter a cycle of seeing him pop up.

in a way, i hope they never make a sequel for this movie. it's perfect the way it is. santa with his tattoos and accent, the sandman and his plump and silent ways, the toothfairy and her... well, her bird looks? i honestly didn't get the idea behind this. i understand humming birds are quiet and quick but to have them as tooth bringers? that's weird. still, the more i watched it, i got really into the toothfairy's look and design. even the easter bunny looked masculine and almost daunting until you realize that he's just a big mouthed tough guy who really has his own fear and weaknesses. in a way, i think of him as the cooler version of scrappy do (you know, that annoying little dog 'scooby doo where are you' stuff?). he was more toned down and his chemistry with the other characters all felt strong and realistic.

the personalities and story all felt real in the sense that it was whimsical and it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy in your chest. gets me all ramped up to see it again!",1391126400,,2107,4.329113924050633

I originally saw it in 2D, and really enjoyed it, and kept thinking about how good it would look in 3D, so we bought it and it was fantastic.

The character designs are great, personalities are fun, and animation is gorgeous. Another thing I love is the deeply meaningful story underlying the protagonist in a way that is fitting for young children, but only truly comprehensible and appreciated by the more mature audience, keeping teenagers and adults entertained along with the children.",1390435200,,623,4.724770642201835

4803677,5,B005LAIIFS,"Wonderful movie adaptation of the books by author William Joyce.
We are introduced to the fun spirit of cold and winter Jack Frost in a beautiful movie that is both funny and moving. Basically the Man on The Moon calls upon the Guardians of Childhood: Santa Claus, The Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, and the Sandman to have Jack Frost aid them against Pitch Dark AKA The Boogeyman, who is loose again to threaten children's dreams.

Everyone will love this movie not just children but many adults and even teenagers too. The story is engaging and is well balanced between the action and dramatic and funny parts, there is NEVER a dull moment in the movie, that's how well paced and well edited it is. Movie storytelling at its best!

Dreamworks Studios has created a true masterpiece that can be enjoyed again and again and proves that is not necessary to make a musical out of every children's story in order to be enjoyable.
DVD includes interviews with all main actors talking about their roles, (all well known celebrities) commentary by the producers and director.

Having not the read the books previous to watching the movie, the movie still gave the background for all the characters, including the least obvious ""Man in the Moon"" one, who started off the entire series to begin with! It's great, even if you haven't read the books, because Jack Frost is not in those, he's his own entity. This movie really shows the difference between the ""light"" and the ""dark"", with a wonderful moral at the tail end. I completely recommend this movie!",1389484800,,519,4.6521739130434785

4804062,3,B005LAIIFS,"I am pretty picky about animated movies that I buy and keep and watch again and again.  This one was worth watching once, but is not one that I aim to keep.  It had some funny and cute moments and the animation was good, though not as good as in Brave or the Toy Story series, but overall it just wasn't as appealing.  It was good, but not great.

The Guardians are a collection of familiar figures who are chosen to protect children's beliefs.  They are born of the belief of children and are maintained by that belief.  They include Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy.  But when trouble stirs, another Guardian is called to join their team, Jack Frost...in whom there isn't enough belief to make him visible to kids.  He is kind of footloose, fancy-free, and wild and refuses to join their team, but gets dragged in anyway.  They face another figure that is familiar to kids--the Boogie Man, who plans to turn all children's beliefs into fear and nightmares and so take over the world.

Pluses in the movie include Santa Claus's Russian-style accent, his assortment of goofy bell-like elves, and his army of Yeti.  Also, having the Easter Bunny with an Australian accent and being so far from fluffy as you could get was another high point.  We get to visit not just Santa's shop at the North Pole, but the Easter Bunny's headquarters where all those pretty painted eggs come from.  There were genuinely funny moments in this movie, and the message was a positive one in the end, but I doubt this movie will ever become an animated classic.  It just didn't have enough adult appeal, such as you find in animated movies like Toy Story and The Incredibles.

Not so much for the very youngest kids due to some scary moments, but slightly older ones will probably enjoy it.",1388620800,,1800,4.56386292834891

4804066,5,B005LAIIFS,What a great movie. I loved it so much I bought a copy for my nephews. It's about never losing that magic of childhood. And it's surprisingly funny. Don't let the odd-looking Easter Bunny turn you off; this is a surprisingly awesome movie.,1388534400,,239,4.5813953488372094
4804117,4,B005LAIIFS,"Despite all the positive reviews posted here, this film was a box office failure.  Reviews were mixed.  Few people went to see it (putting the question of a sequel in doubt).  It was based on a series of books I've never heard of (by William Joyce).  It supposedly features the icons of childhood (whatever that means).  The plot follows a well-worn formula of a bad guy (Pitch) who rises up and overruns the world, efficiently disabling the good guys until the very last second when goodness rallies and overcomes.  Yadda-yadda-yadda.  There's nothing new in that except for the team of good guys being the Easter bunny and Santa, et cetera.  Otherwise, you can plug in any assortment of characters and use this same old plot.
But.  It is cute and earnest and well crafted.  The voice talent does a good job.  It's fast paced.  It is entertaining and fun in its own way.  But there's nothing particularly original about it.",1388534400,,924,4.7

4804412,5,B005LAIIFS,"Rise of the Guardians is a sweet, strange, and highly imaginative movie for people of any age. My one regret is not seeing it when it was in the cinema last year.  It's not at all what I expected.  It has action but no real violence.  It talks of the importance of childhood virtues such as wonder, hope, dreams, memories and fun.  And there seems to be a surprisingly spiritual overtone.  There is humor and ample creativity.  The film was beautifully made and Jack Frost is a sweet and endearing protagonist.  I think this is a highly under-rated movie that deserves more attention than it has received.  And if you like it the film is based on the childrens' book series The Guardians of Childhood.

It's odd that here on Amazon the DVD is currently 10.99 yet to stream it is 13.99.  It's usually cheaper to stream a movie to a computer than it is to buy it on DVD.  This is the first time I have seen this with a movie listed here on Amazon.  So don't bother streaming it.  Just buy yourself the DVD.  It's worth it.",1386720000,,1020,4.328042328042328

You really feel for the characters and bond with them. The art from the original books doesn't really look like the art in this film, but you can still tell that they're the same characters.

I don't remember Jack Frost being a thing when I was a kid, but my daughter is really into him and to find him at the center of this movie is a real treat.  From my point of view, this movie just teeters on the line of being too scary for young kids, but my children handle it well enough.

I really enjoyed how the characters are portrayed--Alec Baldwin as North is probably my favorite.  I don't know if this is going to be a franchise or not, but my kids just want more of it!",1385856000,,536,3.9813084112149535

4804517,5,B005LAIIFS,This is the cutest movie! I love the way it combines all of the classic holiday and children's' characters and has them join together to fight the boogeyman. They executed this very well and is one of my favorite movies to watch with the kids.,1385251200,,243,4.4222222222222225

4804525,2,B005LAIIFS,"While I enjoyed many of the cute characters in this movie, and thought the overall concept was creative, I felt many of the scenes were far too intense for young viewers, especially the ""nightmares"". When you take characters some children believe in, such as Santa and the Tooth Fairy, and create an extremely frightening world they could also consider as real, I think it becomes too much. We didn't let our seven year old finish watching it.",1384473600,7,443,4.766233766233766

I liked all the characters and the way the story was done, and know my nephews will enjoy it, too. My 16 month old nephew won't understand it just yet, but I know he will like all the bright colors.

Lets hope they make the rest of them.

The Blu-ray looks awesome and the kids love the features, pick it up when it's on sale! Gotta love Amazon!",1383782400,,452,4.345238095238095

I yawned a few times... kinda corny. I wouldn't bother watching it again. Kept kids attention half-way or so. Good animation though.",1383436800,,274,5.395348837209302

The movie itself I would definitely recommend. I recorded it when we had free movie channels with DirecTV and it quickly became a family favorite in our house. My daughter even pretends to be playing with Jack Frost and Sandy, but she says her favorite is the Tooth Fairy. It just brings all the magic of these Guardians to life in a way that I never imagined. It really is a wonderful movie.",1382486400,,560,4.2924528301886795

IMO every one of these purchases was worth it. The movie itself is funny and very enjoyable to watch. The 3D on this movie is up there with how to train your dragon, and is definitely worth taking note of. This is a great movie for any time of the year, especially the holidays. Rent it, or buy it.

4804904,5,B005LAIIFS,"As an aunt with a toddler niece & nephew, I have seen my fair share of animated movies. This  one is at the top of the list, trust me! You don't see many animated movies with a deeply rooted meaning that can both entertain & move you, but Guardians delivers. Aside from being ridiculously cute & funny (no naughty words or innuendo), it teaches children that fear is a poison that can only discourage you & keep you from achieving your goals in life. It teaches that hope & faith are at the center of success & happiness. It isn't about the Boogie Man & fictitious childhood heroes like Santa Clause & the Easter Bunny. It's about so much more. With all the political & social unrest in the world, children need more movies like Rise of the Guardians for positive encouragement. I highly recommend this for all ages!!!",1380326400,,818,4.489932885906041

4805004,5,B005LAIIFS,"I find that ""Rise of the Guardians"" is a film for everyone to enjoy, including adults. It tells the story of how the Bogeyman creates a chaos by turning children's pleasant dreams into nightmares and by tricking them to stop believing in Santa Claus, the easter bunny, and all of these beloved characters we all know of. As kids continue to stop believing, innocence and magic begin to disappear, weakening the guardians and earning the Bogeyman more strength to continue with his madness. Does he win? Are innocence and magic finally lost? That would be for me to keep and for you to find out. Also, don't forget the popcorn, because the movie experience will be great. Yes, this is my way of saying that the film rules!",1379376000,,721,4.640625

Some of the magical beings that we believed in when we were kids take on the Boogie Man when he tries to crush childrens hopes and dreams. Great cast for this movie.

4805168,5,B005LAIIFS,"I bought the digital version from Amazon and it always plays nicely with no stops or buffering.  I've watched this one over and over with my little one (you know how that goes) and could watch it over and over some more (can't say that for many of them).  The premise of this movie is that our mythical icons such as Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy are actually real and they protect the children of the world.  My little one talks about the Sandman now when she knew nothing about him before. My favorite part every time watching with her is when they win over darkness and the Sandman makes some beautiful, golden creatures for the children like full-size dinosaurs walking through town and every time my daughter squeals ""DINOSAURS!""  So great.  Try this one if you haven't. I think you'll like it, even if you don't have a little one to add extra enjoyment.",1378684800,2,879,4.50314465408805

A few scary bits if your watchers are very young and easily scared, but even the scary bits were bearable (and the way they were portrayed was a lovely bit of animation)",1378339200,,317,4.389830508474576

4805257,5,B005LAIIFS,"I admit that I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. We have family movie nights with our 8 and 4 year old and I'm always looking for movies that my wife and I will enjoy too.  This movie has a decent rating on commonsensemedia.com, so we gave it a try.  I usually temper my expectations when it comes to animated films, but this one was really quite enjoyable.  My wife and I both enjoyed it as much as my girls did. I wasn't sure they could do so much to bring these fantasy characters ""to life"", but I am impressed at what they came up with.  I would highly recommend this movie.  It's not something you should be too worried about sharing with your kids, although there are some scenes that are a little bit scary...but so are a lot of other kids movies.  This one is not over the top in comparison to others I've seen.",1377475200,,833,4.175
4805258,5,B005LAIIFS,"A friend told me this was a very good movie but I didn't want to see it. I thought:  Great! Now they're just making these wonderful story book characters into warriors or action heroes corrupting the culture with even more war worship or glorified violence. I didn't let my kids see it until I rented it and was pleasantly proved wrong.

So there is fighting here but in my opinion it serves the story well rather than supplant it like many other senseless movies do these days. The movie has a message, it's authentic unlike so many of those tired happy endings in much of the Disney movies which are so superficial they do not reflect the lessons the original stories were teaching kids long time ago. I'm talking The Little Mermaid as one of the examples...

Well regarding Rise of the Guardians, I say it's definitively worth renting and having in your collection.",1377475200,,868,4.623376623376624
4805259,5,B005LAIIFS,"I freaking love this movie. Every time I see it it makes me smile and I just fall more in love.

4805262,4,B005LAIIFS,"I actually enjoyed this movie enough to watch twice - it's a cute story and well done.  I love how the ""guardians"" are all different than what you'd expect.  Santa is semi-Russian, the Easter Bunny is Australian, and the Sandman is mute and speaks in symbols.  The story is about Jack Frost and his life after the Man in the Moon selected him for his role in the world.  He is happy go lucky, fun, and loves life and making kids happy - he embodies the ""fun"" that kids see in wintertime.  He isn't thrilled to be selected as a Guardian, and kinds of balks, but once he realizes his power and that he wants to help keep the world safe from the Boogeyman, he embraces it.",1377043200,,669,4.2362204724409445

4805308,5,B005LAIIFS,"I am a 31 year old man that does enjoy the animated films that have humor to be interpreted for any age. The previews and commercials for this film did not do it justice. When I saw them, I wrote them off to yet another holiday-themed kid's film with seemingly no real story-line. Since it came to HBO, I gave it a shot one afternoon. I'll sum it up in three words - ""I WAS WRONG!"" This film completely blew me away. The characters and storyline were incredible and well imagined. There is an underlying theme of believe in the good of other people, and the film portrayed that in a very touching way. One of my favorite concepts is that our childhood memories are saved in our teeth. Once the tooth fairy takes them, her fairies keep them and remind us of those memories when we need them most. I don't normally take the time to write reviews for movies, but I felt I needed to for this one. I've since watched it THREE times! I was disappointed that the movie studios have written it off as a failure due to box office results. Again, I blame this on the advertising. My recommendation is to see it, and I guarantee you'll want to watch it again. Hopefully, there will be enough interest in the after-release that the studios may reconsider a sequel.",1376697600,6,1252,4.377682403433476
4805309,4,B005LAIIFS,"This was one of the first items I ordered for my kindle, because lets face it, its epic.

I can gush and coo about the story line for ages, but Ill leave that to people who actually reviewed the movie rather than its adaptation for the kindle like this, so here is my opinion for the adaptation: It was super neat, I love the x-ray feature. I have very little knowledge of actors (celebrities are not so interesting in my opinion, ha) but it really helped when a voice came on and Id sit there and think I know that voice! WHY do I know that voice?! That did save my brain several times, so Im very happy with it. (:

My bummer note to this epic adaptation is that it can get pixilated at times, grainy or whatever. It did make me kind of sad since some of what makes this movie so awesome is that the animation is so well done, but hey, what can you do I guess. It didn't happen a ton of times, but it did make me twitch a little anyway.",1376697600,2,938,4.010695187165775

4805651,5,B005LAIIFS,"I really hesitated buying this movie. I am an animation junkie and my children follow my lead.  But, I found it a little difficult to understand the premise. That is, until we rented it. My young daughter fell in love with Sandy.  My son was riveted by Jack.  I thought the group of characters was richly drawn, especially for a movie aimed at a young audience.  There are so many discussions that can be had with your children--faith, love, anger, friendship, dreams.  The final scenes were even a bit more emotional than I expected. It has become a major favorite in our house. Keep in mind there are some rather dark scenes, but I do believe they are handled well overall.",1375142400,,675,4.545454545454546

4806134,5,B005LAIIFS,"I'm pretty 'old school' when it comes to traditions like Santa and the Easter bunny and I can tell you, these aren't the same ones I told all my kids about BUT, now that they're grown with kids of their own, they're certainly having fun with the concept!

The idea of Tooth Fairies, Easter Bunny and Santa as 'Superheroes' is a pretty neat concept. And introducing stories about Sandman and Jack Frost, about whom so little is known anyway, really gives them personality. As an adult (a really old...OLD...adult), I appreciated this movie on many different levels, but most especially it gave me an excuse to still believe!

In Rise of the Guardians, Santa is still jolly but he's seen to really be involved in INSURING the innocence and goodness in children, rather than just rewarding them by chance. It makes Santa seem more personal, to me.

As for the Easter bunny, well, fluffy bunnies are cute, but to have a 'tough guy', Australian hopper who is in cahoots with Santa in keeping the ""child"" in childhood is pretty cool, too! I mean, I love Peter Cottontail to death, but as an adult I can appreciate this version!

Sandman has always been a vague, benign sort of tradition. I like that this character is all cute and squoodgie...with a piece of iron at his core when provoked. The Tooth Fairy (and all her little 'Baby Teeth'!) make me wish I could put my false teeth under my pillow to see if I could fool them and catch a glimpse in the wee hours!!!  But Jack Frost...wow. There's a whole new story for us all. Or maybe that story is from a different cultural tradition, I don't know. What I do know is that when he caught up with his former life memories, I cried.

All in all, I really loved this movie. I watched it with my two of my granddaughters, ages 4 and 2 1/2. They were spellbound! However, I think this movie is best left to the older children who are on the verge of losing those beliefs to impending adulthood. Not because little kids won't enjoy it, but as a little incentive to hang on to the dreams.",1373500800,,2026,4.44743935309973

I've always loved Jack Frost as a kid and every Christmas watched (and still watch) every Jack Frost Claymation movie that was out there!

Yeah, it is okay ... watch it and most will come away with a good feeling in their belly.  Finer details, its all about how you grew up with the tales on the Guardians, but I did like seeing Jack Frost get a lead role with lots of screen time...been awhile.

4806722,5,B005LAIIFS,"I was aware of this movie's existence long before I bothered to watch it.  i picked it up for my kid brother, and we sat down on a Friday evening just to watch the first half-hour.  As it happened, not only did we watch the entire film, but so did half of my family!  We were all starstruck by this amazing movie!
The Rise of the Guardians is definitely the most advanced and beautifully animated film I have ever seen.  The level of detail and artistic vision in each scene was absolutely incredible, more so when I know just how much painstaking effort goes into making animated films.  Besides the design, the screenwriting was excellent, which says a lot in an age where most animated films are written for young children, and so seem very immature-borderline-idiotic.  But even adults could be entertained by the banter and the dramatic flair in RotG.  Also, the storytelling was flawless--the plot was tidy, the characters smart and winsome, the settings interesting and visionary--the story pacing never lagged and the action flowed smoothly.  Lastly, the voice talent was especially great.  The actors really sold the characters; Chris Pine was brilliant as Jack--he brought so much energy and emotion, and his narration was beautiful.
For me, the bright moments were seeing where each character lived and how they traveled (like Santa in the North Pole--love his sleigh!) and watching the comic elves.  Perhaps the first thing to make me laugh was Sandman--to get much-deserved attention--picking up a tiny elf and shaking him to make his hat's little bell ring!  And definitely the best humorous comeback belongs to the Easter Bunny, as the heroes race through the ice tunnels on Santa's sleigh...
  Santa (enjoying himself): I hope you like the loop-the-loops!
  Bunny (with a death-grip on his seat): *gulp* Hope you like carrots!
If you have any appreciation for fun animated films, please give this one screen time at your house.  You will definitely enjoy it.  Have fun and believe!",1371254400,,1997,4.948948948948949

This is an amazing movie. It is rewarding to watch this movie just to see the incredibly beautiful animation. We first saw pieces of this Blu-ray movie playing at the store. It was so amazing, that it was this movie that finally convinced us to buy a very large, high definition TV.

Special effects aside, the plot of this movie is brilliant and uplifting. Each character has his or her own personality and is highly and creatively developed. I highly recommend this movie masterpiece for the young and old alike. This is a very special, unforgettable movie!",1370736000,5,783,4.75

The film puts a creative spin on childhood heroes, or guardians, of special holidays and events like Santa, Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy, etc. The Guardians team up to fend off the evil force of darkness that brings fear and bad dreams. They actively recruit the young Jack Frost to meet the challenge. Jack's memory about his past is sketchy, but when it does finally return, you understand why he is the perfect complement to the Guardians.",1370390400,,564,4.76530612244898

The Easter bunny through me for a bit of a loop, but I was charmed in by the end of the first scene with him.  The story was totally appropriate for children and engaging for adults, without the tiresome ""adult"" innuendos, implications and not-so-cute comments so many animated film writers include in an effort to engage adults.

4807549,5,B005LAIIFS,"Every once and a while, a truly special film comes along that defies expectations about what a film can be, and also makes you wonder why no one ever thought of doing something like it before.

A worthy effort from first time director Peter Ramsey, ""Rise of the Guardians"" is at once epic, touching, exciting, heartwarming, at times quite scary; in short, everything that makes a good movie. Truly, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, animated or otherwise.

Being someone who, at 19, still believes wholeheartedly and without shame in the ""Big Three"" (Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny), I quickly became a fan of William Joyce's excellent series-in-the-making ""The Guardians of Childhood"", which attempts to give a history to some of the most beloved legendary figures, including the lesser-known Sandman, Jack Frost, and of course, the Bogeyman himself, named, what else, Pitch Black. The film occurs some 300 or so years after the books, and deals with the Guardian's need for a new member to help them in their fight against Pitch as he attempts to corrupt the children of the world's dreams by turning them into nightmares and in the process squelching their belief in the Guardians at all, in an effort to take over.

While on the surface an adventure film, at its heart, it is a tale about discovering who you are, what gift we as individuals can contribute to the world, the awesome power of belief, and the importance of keeping our childlike sense of wonder alive. No, this isn't like your typical DreamWorks picture, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The storyline is superbly well crafted and never once loses its focus, and the avoidance of humor that relies on crude and suggestive humor and already-dated pop culture refererences gives it an irresistibly timeless feel. While there are many serious moments (I was brought to tears many times), the film is also just plain fun, a delightful joyride that deserves the designation of a family film more than most others produced nowadays.

All of the characters are wonderfully unique, with their own distinct personalities, further enhanced by the fabulous acting jobs of all-star actors including Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, and Hugh Jackman. While they might be tweaked a bit from the original stories, they retain the overall essence of each Guardian (For example, the Easter Bunny, instead of the stuffy, egg-obsessed Pooka he is in the book, is now a tough, no-nonsense Aussie).

It's a real shame that this gem of a movie was considered a box-office failure upon its release and was subsequently made a scapegoat for DreamWork's current financial difficulties, because it is so well done and has so much to offer. With a great story, a beautiful message, gorgeous animation, and a great voice cast, I can't think of a way to possibly make it any better than it is.",1369094400,,2873,4.879098360655738

4807636,5,B005LAIIFS,... you'll love this! Saw this at the theatres the same day I saw Wreck It Ralph. This was the more surprising of the two. I rarely expect Dreamworks to match Pixar when it comes to story. This was the best Dreamworks flick since How to Train Your Dragon. Couldn't wait to own it.,1368748800,,280,4.203703703703703
4807637,5,B005LAIIFS,"Animation has sure come a very long way.  This film is incredibly beautiful.  The texture, color and depth of the scenery is astounding and the detail in all the characters is miraculous.  What is even more astounding are the characters themselves.  ""Santa"" is not the jovial rotund bearded and non-threatening old man portrayed forever by a popular soft drink's advertising but this ""Santa"" is based on a Cossack warrior and has the attitude to go with it.  The Easter Bunny is rough and tumble and an Australian.  The Tooth Fairy suffers from AADD.  And Jack Frost is not quite sure of himself.  All in all this is a great film that mom and dad won't mind watching with the kids.  Also the jumping eggs in the Easter edition were a nice touch.",1368748800,,745,4.583333333333333

4807714,3,B005LAIIFS,"Interesting to see North(Santa) with tattoo's, the Easter bunny is a hybred bunny/kangaroo and  the sandman, as a short pudgy mute. I'll give the creators credit for coming up with a very different take on these charters, and that's really where the fun of the movie is. The plot/story is basic and has been done many times before.
Watched the movie with my kids age 5 and 8, needless to say they didn't get all the jokes, and were actually bored at certain parts of the movie.
Not bad but not worth owning.",1368662400,,507,4.451612903225806

4807718,4,B005LAIIFS,"Critics suck sometimes... I should know, I'm a film graduate and so I often fall into that ""critic"" category. But this movie is honestly a blast and I'm sad it didn't do better in the theater. It was just poorly advertised, poorly released and critics are tired of almost every animated movie anymore. So yes... this isn't going to change your life or take over Pixar or make animation-haters suddenly realize what they've been missing all these years. Its story is good, nothing epic like Toy Story... but the visuals are gorgeous, the world is fascinating and alive, and if you're even looking at this review, it's because that's kinda what you were looking for anyway, I bet.  (Also, it's nice to finally have a movie that is based more around Easter for once so we can have an annual Easter movie.)

My 5 year old LOVED this movie. I had a ton of fun in it too and bought it on day one after seeing it in the theater. It's comparable to How to Train Your Dragon in quality of visuals and storytelling, so if you liked that, you'll like this.

Some of the darker scenes can be slightly frightening to younger viewers as the villain is Pitch Black (the Boogey Man) but the movie teaches a good lesson for kids and can be a great teaching tool for some of you with scared-of-the-dark children: (Spoiler Alert!!!) Darkness can be scary and the Boogey Man can be frightening, but in the end, he can't do anything to us if we don't give him the power to. It's also empowering for your kids to see that the human children in this story turn the tide of battle, not those with the super-powers. It's not TOO frightening though- my daughter climbed in my lap to watch the rest of the film but never covered her eyes.

Now I don't mean to be offensive- but if you are one of those that looked at Santa in the trailer or posters and said ""I can't believe they gave Santa tattoos,"" you should probably just skip this and move onto something else (though I'd never get a tattoo myself- just a personal choice). It ruined the whole movie for my mom, my kid's grandma (who was also mad that in UP! they killed the main bad guy (""You can't do that in a cartoon!"")). This world is based on our most beloved holiday ""guardians"" being a warrior/superhero team when they are not covering their own responsibilities. The premise alone is probably too much for traditionalists... but I personally loved the designs, and the characters embody a sense of adventure as much as a sense of awe and wonder.

Action-packed, constantly moving (where did my last 90 minutes go??), heartfelt and attention-grabbing... this movie really does need to be seen to understand what I'm talking about.",1368576000,,2666,4.534303534303534
4807719,5,B005LAIIFS,"Anything to do with the holidays are a treat for us!  No matter what time of the year, this movie is a strong contender as one of those animated movies you can see over and over again!  This is the perfect movie to introduce some of the not-so-well known characters like Jack Frost into the lives of children...even the adults in the family enjoyed this great story.  I am always fascinated how writers can come up with new storylines for timeless characters and still make them wonderful to see and hear!

The idea that the fabeled Santa, Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Easter Bunny team up with Jack Frost to take on ""The Boogie Man"" is a great plot line.  It is well executed, fast paced and packs a few great lessons in along the way (Jack Frost needs to find out what he really believes in so that he can realize his true potential and the kids are taught that believing in somebody helps them succeed...a great lesson for business, leaderships and relationships!).

This is watched monthly now, and our toddler will regularly grab sticks and be ""Jack Frost"".  This is quite a feat given he is usually only Iron Man.  He asks if Sandman will come give him good dreams.

At this age, i don't think our son was getting the whole ""believe or not believe"" or the power of faith.  He understood something bad was happening, but to him it was just the bad guy stopping the good guys from doing their work (not how that work affected all the kids).

Still - he will watch it for the entire length, and that is the hallmark of a great movie to me.",1368489600,,720,4.368421052631579

As he did with ""Oz, the Great and Powerful"", writer David Lindsay-Abaire tries to compensate for his total inability to write believable characters with trite platitudes -- in this case, wanting people to believe in you. Believe in YOURSELF, for God's sake! Designed within an inch of its life, ""Guardians"" is watchable, but oh SO familiar! Hollywood has forgotten how to write fantasy. These days films scream ""wonder"" and ""awe-inspiring"", telling you what you ought to be feeling. This film never shuts up about the ""wonder"" of childhood, mouthed by adults who have forgotten what that is. As that old writer's maxim goes: ""show, don't tell.""

4808381,4,B005LAIIFS,"Since when are Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy superheroes?  As children, it's not like the majority of us put Batman, Spider-Man and the Tooth Fairy in the same conversation - but, who needs Captain America and the rest of The Avengers when Jack Frost and The Sandman are watching over you?  As it turns out, novelist William Joyce believes folklore characters from our childhood would make for interesting superheroes.  His popular book series, The Guardians of Childhood, are the basis for the 2012 DreamWorks Animation film, Rise of the Guardians - which turn Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and the Sandman, into heroes.  Not only does Santa and the rest of their characters bring children presents on the holidays, they are also collectively members of a super group that protects children (good or bad) - known as, ""The Guardians.""

Adapted to screen by David Lindsay-Abaire (Robots) and directed by Peter Ramsey (Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space), Rise of the Guardians stars Jack Frost (Chris Pine), a super-powered young man (but at least 300 years old) with the ability to control the winter elements - including snow and ice.  Struggling to remember the person he was prior to becoming Jack Frost, he is reluctant to become a new member of ""The Guardians,"" a group that protects children.  The Guardians, led by Nicholas St. North, aka Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), are alerted that the Boogeyman (Jude Law) has returned to fill children with fear.  Along with Santa, the rest of the Guardians - E. Aster Bunnymund, aka the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) and the voiceless Sandman, aka Sandy - take on the task of convincing Jack Frost that he must become a member of The Guardians to help them stop the Boogeyman before he makes the world's children forget about all of them and force them to live in fear, forever.

The Rise of the Guardians plot features the typical good vs. evil conundrum, with colorful characters and a slew of laugh-out-loud moments.  These characters stay true to their reputations and are wonderfully written and charming.  Alec Baldwin is the most notable in the voice acting department since he does such a stunning job of disguising his voice for the role of Santa Claus.  Hugh Jackman is clearly recognizable (and the rabbit/kangaroo references are quite funny), as is Jude Law in his role as the villain, the Boogyman - a dark and dastardly `avatar' look-a-like.  The third tier supporting characters are quiet, yet effective - which include a large group of tooth fairies, elves, walking eggs, and wookie-looking creatures.  As it turns out, the elves are relatively useless in Santa's workshop, with the majority of the work being done by these Chewbacca-like wookies (that also speak in a similar manner as a wookie).

In principle, this film feels like the animated holiday version of Marvel's The Avengers.  Santa is the leader, and it takes a major super villain to bring the entire team together in order to fight for the same cause:  protecting the world's children.  Aside from the plot, this film is simply one more film, like Toy Story or any other children's film that centers around one specific character, where the main character is inevitably surrounded by a wide-range of supporting characters with very different personalities.  However, in the case of The Guardians, you really couldn't find a group of characters with less in common (different jobs) and more in common (children) all at the same time - which is the dynamic that makes the premise of this film such a unique idea.

It's difficult to find any outstanding issues with Rise of the Guardians and overall, it's a very well-rounded film.  Not only does this film feature a majority of the beloved holiday characters - it's a film that everyone can easily enjoy.  The film makes for a comforting trip down memory lane - a trip that the whole family should sit down and enjoy together.  There's a bit of humor, a handful of action scenes, and some of the most recognizable names in Hollywood doing the voice work - all collectively creating a memorable movie experience.

Overall Film Grade:  B

4808780,5,B005LAIIFS,"Good movie for kids and adults! My four year old got a bit spooked of the boogy man, but overall loved it and watched it several times!",1366934400,,135,4.037037037037037

4808783,5,B005LAIIFS,We enjoy this movie. Might be a little scary  for really Little Ones. The Boogyman can give a little fright.,1366848000,,108,4.4

4808785,5,B005LAIIFS,This is a great movie. The CGI is great but the story line is hilarious. I was rooting for Jack Frost from the beginning. What a likable character. Hilarious movie.,1366848000,,164,4.5

4808920,5,B005LAIIFS,We saw this in the theatre and I knew I would be buying this for my kids because it is one of those movies you want to watch over and over. Story and characters were well developed and the animation was amazing. Highly recommend.,1366848000,,229,4.2272727272727275
4808921,5,B005LAIIFS,"Saw this movie twice in theaters with my son who loves it.  I'm no movie critic, but the movie I thought was very entertaining.  It does seem a little rushed at the end, but it's a kids movie and you can only hold their attention for so long.  The voice acting was great.",1366848000,,271,4.0754716981132075
4808922,5,B005LAIIFS,This is a very cute kids movie and was a perfect gift for my neice and nephew who each have 2 children of their own now. Gotta try to find them a little something besides sweets.,1366761600,,178,3.9722222222222223

4808925,5,B005LAIIFS,"This movie flows well from scene to scene.  Each of the characters is deep and real, having problems each is dealing with just like any of us.  The characters have character flaws which make them more real but they try to put aside their own problems for the benefit of the innocent of the world, the children they protect.  Even though it is sad that one of the guardians dies, I feel elated every time I watch the scene where he is resurrected.  Also, the guardians never give up, no matter what circumstances they find themselves in, particularly when hope seems lost for the guardian, Tooth.  The guardians rally around her and circumstances improve immensely due to their combined efforts to help one whom they deeply care for.  This movie can teach us that no matter how dire our situation or the situation we find our loved ones to be in, if you just believe, show a little faith, and try your hardest, the bad can be defeated in the end.  This is a must-see movie for anyone feeling depressed and hopeless.",1366761600,,1014,4.538461538461538

4808963,5,B005LAIIFS,"Watched this with my 11 year old granddaughter and we both loved it.  Had a good moral message to it.  I would have preferred Jesus to help out along with all the mythical characters, I think that would have added to the storyline.",1366761600,,231,4.348837209302325

4808965,5,B005LAIIFS,"This movie was unexpected, and cute. I hate christmas and all that hoopla, but this movie provided an interesting spin on the holidays and my daughter loves it. The 3D is more about depth than popping out at you so that was a bit disappointing, but the movie was enjoyable enough I wasn't too bothered.",1366675200,,302,4.509090909090909
4808966,5,B005LAIIFS,We ordered this as a present for my 11 year olds birthday. I appreciate the message it was trying to teach all of us.,1366675200,,117,3.9166666666666665
4808967,5,B005LAIIFS,Great movie! I still watch it even if the kids fall asleep.... Will become a classic along the lines of Nemo & the Toy Story movies. It never gets old & I notice new things every time we watch it,1366675200,,195,3.9

4809031,4,B005LAIIFS,"Not up to These guys standard, or maybe nothing can be better then Dragon trainer. I had some bad luck that the disc was faulted in the middle of the film, like hacking, when reading",1366675200,,182,4.228571428571429
4809032,5,B005LAIIFS,Reminds me of the JRPGs I used to play an a lot of the anime movies and shows I used to watch,1366588800,,93,3.272727272727273
4809033,5,B005LAIIFS,"My kids loved this movie.  It did have some ""scary"" parts but they weren't too terrible and the over all story was just great.  Loved the characters and the meaning behind it all.  Great movie.",1366588800,,193,4.457142857142857
4809034,3,B005LAIIFS,It was good but it felt like more could have been done.  I can't pinpoint what I think should be changed or elaborated on but it left me a little wanting.,1366588800,,154,3.967741935483871
4809035,5,B005LAIIFS,Our whole family loved this film.  Great all around family flick.  Only disappointment was the wind-up eggs that came with it.  They didn't work too well.,1366588800,,154,4.846153846153846
4809036,3,B005LAIIFS,"This movie was cute, but not very funny. I would recommend it for small children, but not enough adult humor for adults to enjoy.",1366588800,,129,4.416666666666667
4809037,5,B005LAIIFS,"The story is simple but moving! There is a lot of great action! Color, texture, soundtrack are perfect! Voice actor fantastic great job!",1366588800,,136,4.956521739130435
4809038,2,B005LAIIFS,"I'm the kind of guy that won't tell my daughter that there is no Santa until she asks.

I think it's absurd to spend a lot of energy trying to really convince her that those pleasant white lies about the Easter Bunny, Jack Frost, and Santa are really true.  This movie depicts a battle between fear and these ""guardians"" and promotes the view that the greatest danger is children not believing.

In spite of being non-religious myself, it's a little disconcerting to see Santa and the Easter Bunny as characters totally divorced from Christmas, Christianity and the religious context for those holidays.",1366588800,5,603,4.892156862745098
4809039,4,B005LAIIFS,Thought it was a good movie for the grandkids. They all seemed to like it. Taught them about standing up for what they believe.,1366588800,,127,4.333333333333333

4809121,5,B005LAIIFS,"We all loved this movie. I took the kids at Christmas time and was dreading sitting threw another boring, silly kid movie. The last movie I really enjoyed watching with my kids was Tangled. So I really don't get into many cartoons, but this movie I loved! My 15 year old down to my 3 year old sat at the edge of their seats threw the entire thing. So I bought it for them all for Easter and they have all watched it now several times.  There is some scary horses in it that mine younger two found frightening but if you have seen Sleeping beauty's dragon this is along the same scaryness:} Very clean, very uplifting fun movie!",1366588800,,627,4.26890756302521
4809122,5,B005LAIIFS,"Every kid should watch this movie. It's okay to explain that this is a human's idea of what all the ""Guardians"" are like, but it helps explain why some kids get $5 from the Tooth Fairy and another gets $.50! It brings Jack Frost into the discussion and that is awesome when you live where there is real winter :)",1366588800,,312,4.216666666666667
4809123,4,B005LAIIFS,Good story and the best part is that there is no merchandising to go with it. Think of that just a movie!,1366588800,,105,3.8181818181818183
4809124,5,B005LAIIFS,We saw this movie at the theatre and new instantly we would have to buy it when it came out on DVD. I would recommend for 6 and over because there are a few scary scenes.,1366502400,,170,3.75
4809125,5,B005LAIIFS,"Story, writing, art design and direction.

I can't believe it took me this long to finally see it.

4809126,5,B005LAIIFS,i went to see this movie several times in theaters and am glad to own it now. despite the changes from the books it is still a wonderful story and one of my favorite movies.,1366502400,,173,3.9714285714285715
4809127,5,B005LAIIFS,the twist on the players from seet and innocent to tough and protective was a good way to show that while you can  be good you can also stand up for yourself,1366502400,,157,3.90625

4809183,4,B005LAIIFS,When I first saw the trailer for this movie I had my doubts.  But with such bug name voices such as Hugh Jackman and Chris Pine I had to watch it.  Throughout the movie I could not help but laugh and aw and the right moments.  This movie is not only great for kids but for adults who enjoy a cute movie once in a while.,1366416000,,319,3.803030303030303
4809184,5,B005LAIIFS,Fun movie for the kids although a it may be a little scary for 3-5 year olds.  Overall fun movie for all.,1366416000,,105,3.772727272727273
4809185,4,B005LAIIFS,"Throughout your childhood you are told of incredible persons that bring hope and joy. Well, what if I told you they were real, and they were like a super-hero team defending the children of the world? 'Rise of the Guardians' is an amazing story featuring a stellar voice cast, incredible animation and something for everyone.

I was not surprised that some of the events that take place are a little non child friendly. Guierrmo Del-Toro, has a way of turning the tamest of fantasy, into a action packed epic and still a ton of heart. This is a movie that children and adults will love and I really hope there are more to follow. Hopefully new guardians as well.",1366416000,,662,4.563025210084033

4809187,2,B005LAIIFS,"I rented it for my grandchildren ages 3, 7 & 9.  They watched the first 20 minutes or so and didn't want to watch anymore.",1366416000,,122,3.88
4809188,3,B005LAIIFS,"For me, this was a very predictable and overly long movie.  It may play better for children as the animation is good and they are already familiar with some of the characters.  It is basically a good versus evil story with all of the good guys coming together to battle evil.  It's an okay movie.  One question, why does Santa Claus have a Russian accent?",1366416000,,355,4.415384615384616
4809189,5,B005LAIIFS,"I didn't go into this movie expecting much but I really enjoyed it, its great for the whole family and if you do any kind of animation you'll love the effects they've put into this.",1366416000,,181,4.2

4809420,4,B005LAIIFS,"At first glance, Rise of the Guardians (ROG) appears to be a rather odd concept.  Santa has tattoos and a thick Russian accent, the Easter Bunny is Australian and not particularly cute, and the Tooth Fairy looks like a hummingbird rather than a typical fairy.  I'll admit, when I first saw the advertisements and the trailer for it, I instantly dismissed this as a box office bomb working too hard to target a family audience.  Oh, how I was mistaken.

This film is amusing, touching, has a message as well as characters you can relate to.  The film follows Jack as he struggles to find his ""center"" or purpose.  People hear his name from time to time, but nobody really knows who he is nor are they able to see him as they can Santa, ect.  With the help of his other guardian friends he is able to remember his past life and discover why the man on the moon created him.

There what I would describe as ""dark"" scenes that might frighten younger or more sensitive viewers.  If adults are looking to watch this with the hope of some laughs, like Despicable Me, Monsters Inc., etc. they may be disappointed.  As I stated before, this film is more charming and amusing than funny.  I would recommend this to everyone.",1366243200,,1214,4.472727272727273

It was fun to watch for children and Adults. Fun little family adventure movie. Enough Adventure to keep adults and older children's attention into it as well. Can't go wrong with this movie, if looking for a movie for the family to watch together. However if your children are a little afraid of villains or alot of action, or even possibly the idea of Santa wielding two swords may upset someone in the family. May want to keep on looking for another family movie to enjoy!",1365984000,,629,4.338983050847458

The characters were a little ""darker"" than I expected but this work. Great story line which flowed easily for kids to follow. Enough there for a yearly comback",1365811200,,300,4.901960784313726

4809878,5,B005LAIIFS,"My 8 year-old and I both loved it! Before it was even over, he asked if there was a ""Rise of the Guardians 2."" There should be. The characters and their environments (Santa's North Pole, the Easter Bunny's lair) were so imaginative - like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Wonderful message of hope, friendship, and the power of believing - similar to Polar Express. The graphics were like nothing I've seen, GORGEOUS!! A lot of laugh-out-loud humor and oh-my-gosh! surprises. I have a feeling that we'll be watching this again and again and again. . .",1365811200,,551,4.810526315789474
4809879,5,B005LAIIFS,"This movie have all the ingredients to be a blockbuster although it depicted the regular  kids heroes in a new (and I have to say very different) light from Santa to the Easter bunny, The tooth fairy, the sandman, etc.

for those who like to see more in a simple kids movie it teaches the concept of believing in yourself and find your ""center""which is  what makes you who you are is it ""joy""? ""hope""? ""courage""? The new guardian needs to find out his before becoming a ""Guardian""

Like in all Disney type of movies there always have to be a villain and in this case it is the Boogie man played in my humble opinion masterfully by Jude Law. It also reinforces the concept of team work  ""be a part of the team"" and not only individual an some times egotistical feats something in vogue nowadays. The guardians are a team the Boogie man stands alone so who do you think will  end up losing?

My son - in my opinion a very good critic for children movies - enjoyed this movie a lot even though he got a little bit frighten by the Boogie man.  I took  advantage of his natural fears  to reinforce one of the focal points of this movie which is that  we will  always feel fear and that's a normal and healthy feeling but we have to overcome those fears because they make the situations and the things or people that oppose us stronger and bigger while taking our confidence away.

That's in my opinion the value of this movie aside of the entertainment factor that in the end is what take you to the movies.

It is a good movie with beautiful and well directed animation and a surprisingly good script and of course a happy ending.",1365811200,2,1626,4.305921052631579

It also reiterated to my children that darkness is always there but that does not mean you should fear it. You are your own Guardian. I fell in love with the characters and my kids also loved them.

4810025,1,B005LAIIFS,"This movie was creepy, and inappropriate for children.  It's as if they were trying to help kids with their nightmares, but all I saw was a potential for more nightmares and a lot of confusion! Definitely not a feel good movie!",1365811200,4,227,4.536585365853658

4810097,5,B005LAIIFS,"I don't always enjoy watching children's movies with my kids, but this one is different.

Finding his core is Jack Frost's goal in proving why he was chosen to be a guardian.

Kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole film.  The characters were excellent, and easily lent themselves to empathy from the viewer.  Part of great films is drawing the viewer in, and allowing them to feel.  This movie does this ""par excellance"".  If I could give it six stars, I would",1365724800,,456,4.69620253164557

I generally like to have a physical copy but was amazed at the quality of the picture when I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire HD.  I used an HDMI cord to connect it to my television.

We make it into a movie night when my daughter takes an early bath and we sit back, have some popcorn and watch a movie.  This movie had a good story and was very pleasant to watch. If it means anything, my daughter did not want to go to bed after watching this movie.  She was really into it.  My wife and I also liked it so it is good for adults too.  Overall, I liked the movie a great deal and would rent it again if someone in my family wanted to watch it.",1365638400,,537,3.8454545454545452

4810275,2,B005LAIIFS,"I really wonder what was going on in the heads of the Dreamworks people who came up with this thing.  The characters are abrasive (especially the Easter Bunny), the basic story is depressing and it is, overall, a waste of time.  Who thought that having the Easter Bunny, Jack Frost and all the others hack Santa open was a good idea?  There seems to be a trend in the computer-made movies to go for splashy effects rather than story and it seems as though, in every case, the characters dislike each other.  Cartoons used to be fun but not any more. Compare this travesty to ""Tangled"", ""Megamind"" or ""Shrek"" and you will see what I mean.",1365552000,5,637,4.4655172413793105

4810329,4,B005LAIIFS,Wasn't sure how the story and/or action would be.  Purchased this because it was 3D and wanted to see in theaters.  Wish I would've seen it there as my 3D screen is small at home.  Overall effects were masterful.,1365552000,,212,4.384615384615385

4810331,5,B005LAIIFS,"Excellent movie for my little man! At 3 years old, I worried he might be frightened by the villain, but he didn't seem bothered by him. Parents, as with any movie, you may want to pre-screen this film and consider your child's threshold for spooky characters.

Love the Easter Bunny character!",1365552000,,293,4.745098039215686
4810332,4,B005LAIIFS,My wife and I purchased this DVD for our grandchildren as an Easter present.  We always screen any DVD we purchase for them.  We found this particular video to be delightful and feel that it's destined to become a classic.,1365552000,,222,4.525

4810334,5,B005LAIIFS,"This movie was cute, adorable, touching, and just overall I loved it. At first I didn't really like the choice of Chris Pine for the main character's voice, but after a while I changed my mind. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1365465600,,233,4.441860465116279

4810336,5,B005LAIIFS,I really enjoyed this movie. I originally opted from seeing this in the theaters with regret. Seeing this in the big screen would have been great with all the animation this movie offered. The story and content were very kid friendly.,1365465600,,234,4.7317073170731705

4810381,5,B005LAIIFS,"Loved this movie. I love all dreamworks animated films and this just topped the list of best family/kids movies ever! My 5-yr old loved it too, but my 2-yr old was not into it",1365465600,,175,4.176470588235294

4810384,3,B005LAIIFS,"This was a cute movie. though it had too much violence it also had some good messages.  I'm not sure what kind of messages we are giving the children, with all the competition and fighting between the ""Good Guys"".  The idea that all the holiday characters were all working to save belief in them was interesting.  I think in the end it redeemed itself .",1365465600,,353,4.4

4810386,5,B005LAIIFS,"This movie was original and refreshing.  Our kids (7 and 3) enjoyed it, as did mom and dad.  We actually watched it again the same day because we liked it so much.  It was a little scary in parts for our little one, but she still wanted to watch it again, so it must not have been too bad.",1365465600,,289,3.864406779661017

4810429,3,B005LAIIFS,"I love William Joyce's work in The Fabulous Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore.  I wanted to see this BECAUSE of that.  I was so disappointed.  Santa... given an accent... I guess to be worldly but a bit too heavy for someone who is to be jolly.  I loved Jack Frost and the tooth fairy... Easter Bunny.... nope... not what he should have been... I think the characters had a bit too much darkness to them.  There seemed to be only one bad guy if you looked at the story.  But if you listened to the characters, their personas and size... of the Easter Bunny... just held too much heaviness inside to be loving.

Maybe the combination of Joyce and his partner in this... took Joyce to the other side... more like something... that should have been made .... maybe with Neil Gaimon or ... Tim Burton.

Not what I expected or wanted.  )-:",1365465600,,836,4.376623376623376

4810432,5,B005LAIIFS,"A lovely story about having belief in the magic of life - dreams, fairies, the Easter Bunny, and Santa. It isn't about the religion behind any of this, but rather the results of believing and supporting the good in others through a sense of wonder and joy at everyday happenings around you. It is told in a very lively manner with great action and bits of comedy with a shot of tension from the threads from the bad guy. A whole lot of fun.",1365465600,,440,4.25
4810433,5,B005LAIIFS,"My kids (11, 9, and 5) love this show. The animation is fun, as are the characters. There are no off-color jokes (passing gas, or talking about people's butts). It has a great message that kids can make a difference.",1365465600,,216,4.425

There was enough action to keep my teenager interested, it was boyish (no princesses) enough for my youngest and funny enough for me to watch it a few times.

The story line is well written and the characters are very entertaining. I never would have guessed that Alec Baldwin played the ""Russian"" Santa. He does a fantastic job! All the characters are interesting and likable - even the villain.

I would recommend this for all ages - but it might be a little scary for 5 and younger.",1365379200,,644,4.4033613445378155

I am somewhat technical, but now i have to create an account at Paramount... oh wait, now I have to install Silver light, oh wait, now I have to download the digital copy... which dumps itself in some obscure spot on my hard drive.  Wait... now what.  They're 4 cab files, encrypted.  So now what.  I want this on my kids kindle.. or atleast my ipad.  Oh no, not that easy.  Itunes will not recognize it.  Then I notice that I could have downloaded it as a digital copy instead of the ultraviolet copy.  Oh ok, so try download it there, assuming in apple format.  Oh wait, won't let me download said its already been redeemed.  Are you KIDDING ME.

Life is better at any age and at all ages if you believe in stories of hope and goodness and if you pass that on to others.

You can ""believe in"" nightmares but just not be afraid of them.

The animation is barely better than Polar Express, the story is weak, the dialogue is even weaker - so much so that it requires constant background music to fill in the otherwise awkward lines. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that my kids didn't hate it as much as I did.

4810715,3,B005LAIIFS,"Rise of the Guardians is a movie based on the characters from William Joyce's Guardians of Childhood books. In fact the movie is set many years after the books and introduces a new guardian in Jack Frost, the other four (The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Santa Claus each having been introduced in their own books).

The movie is clearly intended for children and the guardians picked because they will be recognizable to that audience. The storyline is similarly straight forward too. The Bogeyman has a new plan that will have the worlds children stop believing in the guardians. And when that happens all that will be left is his nightmares.

On top of that plot we have the layer of Jack Frost who has to learn who he really is and come into his own as a guardian. And again this is familiar territory, though reasonably well executed.

Visually the movie is a treat. The character designs while not entirely faithful to the renditions in the books are clearly inspired by them. They are distinctive and full of character while being different from most other animation. The particle effects used for both Sandman, and Jack Frost are quite stunning too.

Voicework is a mixed bag. None of it is terrible, but Alec Baldwin as Santa Claus stands out amongst the Guardians themselves and Jude law is pitch perfect as... well... Pitch (the bogeyman).

That does leave the workmanlike script as the weakest element over all. It's not bad, but it lacks any particularly distinctive spark. From an adult perspective there are points that could really have benefited from more time. particularly the Guardians loss of powers which is very abrupt. But the running time is 97 minutes and you have to wonder if younger children would have the patience for much more than that.

Set your expectations appropriate. This is fun and it doesn't require much in the way of concentration. It looks pretty and kids should enjoy it. Adults will know what's coming but if they can turn off the snark they can enjoy it too.",1365206400,,2018,4.751428571428572

Something about Jack's story of not being seen and not knowing your purpose in life, until you're called into action, that really spoke to me.  Was it the music pulling at my heartsrings?  Was it Chris Pine's terrific voic acting?  Was it the amazing character design and animation?

We gave it to them for Easter, which was perfect timing considering the storyline.  I love how the story has enough tradition in it as well as some flexibility for parents who may have their own twists, if that makes sense.  It is visually appealing, though dark at times.  One daughter was a bit afraid of the boogeyman in the story, but we took the theme from the movie and used it in our own home about how only kids who believe in him can be afraid.

4811100,3,B005LAIIFS,The twin 5 year olds loved it; they want to buy the movie. It was barely tolerable for the parents....,1364947200,,102,4.15

4811104,5,B005LAIIFS,"We saw this in the theater and it became the must own movie in our house! No children under 20 live here so if you love animation and twists and turns in the storyline, you'll love this movie. It may rate as the Indiana Jones of animated movies!",1364947200,,245,4.125
4811105,5,B005LAIIFS,"No offense intended, but British guys ALWAYS make the best bad guys.  I don't feel like it was a big character stretch for Chris Pine to take on Jack Frost either.  You'll find other reviews that go through the storyline and discuss the premises behind the movie, but if you watched the trailer, found yourself intrigued by it, snickered inwardly, then you'll enjoy the movie.",1364947200,,376,4.769230769230769

4811162,3,B005LAIIFS,It was OK for small children but children older than 10 would find it boring.  It wasn't the best animated film I have ever watched and I have watched a lot of children's animated movies.  Kinda of hokey even for a child's film.  Would not recommend for family night.,1364947200,,267,4.408163265306122

4811227,4,B005LAIIFS,"Hey, we originally reviewed this movie back in April before we started Bowling for Movies!  This is the new and improved review:

Rise of the Guardians Bowling for Movies Score: 231.188 of 300

What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

Rise of the Guardians - we own the Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy + UltraViolet

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
Nimble-footed trickster Jack Frost is called upon to rise to occasion and join the ranks of the Guardians (including Santa, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman) when Boogeyman threatens to destroy childhood by changing dreams into nightmares.  Will this diabolical plot be upset by the Guardians... will Jack grow up and take his place among them... or will Boogeyman snuff out childhood dreams and belief??

In a day and age filled to the brim with spectacular computer animation, witty dialog, spin on classic characters, and feel good endings - how can a children's film stand out from the crowd?  The answer - you don't.  Why mess with a formula that's working?  This movie certainly didn't break any new ground in those departments.  (Whoa, movie dude - what gives???  You gave this movie a pretty high score to start out like this - where is the love???)  If you're Big Hollywood, here is what you do - if you're not going to INNOVATE, you IMITATE.  And this movie did just that.  Reluctant hero, called upon to save the day; gives up on the task and himself; only to come back triumphant in the end and finding his true place in the world... is it Shrek or Jack Frost - same story, different location - insert holiday theme :]  (hey, Shrek saved storybook critters, Jack saved Holiday belief!!  That's different!!)  Is it?  I know I didn't see this exact same thing in Polar Express or The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause; oh wait - I did.

That said, I did in fact give it a significant score, well above 200 and in bowling terms, that's a great game.  It was well written, I enjoyed the spin on Santa (or North as he is known), I more than enjoyed the cinematic majesty laid out in rich, un-ghosted 3D.  What this movie lacked in originality it made up for in bringing vivid animation to the big screen.  The story is been-there-done-that but solid, beautifully told, and brings you quickly from the mundane world we live in, into a world were Santa has tattoos (and you don't mind) and the Sandman doesn't say much (out loud) but WOWs with his presence.  The crime of copy-cat-idous is nothing new, especially in this genre - a more imaginative and original story might have seen this movie ""bowl"" a perfect game because it had everything else in place to do just that.  How the technical end of this flick didn't garner at least a nod from the academy is simply beyond me.

What I loved:
-  Spectacularly animated - wonderfully rich world in vibrant color palette and jaw dropping 3D
-  Standard issue story, sure, but told with heart
-  I personally appreciated a much more naturalistic view of not only the holidays but the Guardians; what a great break from the battle between religious and commercial interests, at the end of the day these traditions started in veneration of nature (despite where people try to take them, regardless of what they are peddling)

What I did NOT like:
-  The story itself is a little tired but hey, new audience wouldn't really know that and let's face it - most of America is asleep on their feet and haven't even figured out Star Wars is really just Lord of The Rings (in sppppaaaaacccceee)

Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",1364860800,3,4723,4.456344586728754
4811268,5,B005LAIIFS,"My kids loved this movie, watched it over and over.  It was magical and funny and kept the parents interest.",1364860800,2,108,4.4
4811269,1,B005LAIIFS,I downloaded two movies onto my Kindle Fire Saturday for my grandson to watch in the car while driving home from the beach house and could not pull up either one without WiiFi.  Paid $4.99 each for nothing.  I am pretty upset with Amazon right now.,1364860800,2,248,4.369565217391305
4811270,5,B005LAIIFS,My kids really enjoyed this movie. Would definately recommend for kids of all ages.  My teenage son even enjoyed watching.,1364860800,,122,5.1
4811271,5,B005LAIIFS,"We really enjoyed this movie, and Mom is typically hard to please (who, me?).  :)

It had a great concept.. I would definitely recommend.",1364860800,,137,4.666666666666667
4811272,4,B005LAIIFS,"This movie was pretty good for a lot of different ages. My kids found it hilarious for the most part, but they don't believe in the tooth fairy or Easter Bunny or Santa (so no disappointments).",1364860800,,193,4.388888888888889
4811273,5,B005LAIIFS,"I absolutely loved this movie in the theater - knew I had to have the dvd.  Excellent story line, animation & character depiction.  Love!",1364860800,,137,4.666666666666667
4811274,5,B005LAIIFS,"My son and I love this movie. Its adorable and heartwarming and perfect for a child to watch. The special edition hopping eggs are super cute. This will likely be one of our favorites for a long time.

my only complaint is that the free digital download does not work on my Kindle, there is some app or software that needs to de installed and its not compatible with the Kindle OS. It would be awesome if they could get that fixed up...",1364860800,,436,4.253012048192771

4811276,5,B005LAIIFS,"A must-see for any age, this has to be one of the best animated films ever made. Alec Baldwin as Santa is an added bonus.",1364774400,,121,3.88
4811277,5,B005LAIIFS,"I thought this movie was great, the kids will love this one. I would rate this movie a AAA for a super show.",1364774400,,108,3.739130434782609
4811338,3,B005LAIIFS,"I was very disappointed to find out that the (ultraviolet)digital copy of this wonderful movie is only viewable on a desktop or laptop computer.

You cannot save it as a true digital copy usable on a ipad or other portable devices.

If you don't want 3d don't purchase the version that has ultraviolet digital copy.

Other movies don't have such restrictions so beware.",1364774400,2,369,4.825396825396825
4811339,4,B005LAIIFS,I enjoyed the movie; loved the animation/graphics. I think anyone who enjoys animation would like this movie. The hopping eggs gave me a laugh.,1364774400,,143,5.0
4811340,2,B005LAIIFS,"I suppose I could tolerate a sword wielding Santa Claus, a miltant kangaroo-like Easter Bunny, and a fairly dull tooth fairy for the sake of a really good story. Unfortunately, the story is very thin, and the theme is uninspiring. On the good side, the animation is superb, there's plenty of action, Jack Frost is fairly likeable, and the concept is very creative. Overall, I didn't really care for the movie, and I don't believe my three-year-old grandchild would like it (were she given the chance).",1364774400,,501,4.837209302325581
4811341,5,B005LAIIFS,Great movie. My kid loved watching it and playing with the wind up eggs during the movie. More kids movies need to be like this. Enjoyable for parents and kids,1364774400,,159,4.333333333333333
4811342,4,B005LAIIFS,Great movie -- very watchable.  Our 6 year olds had no problem with the movie.  Our 4 year old needed to understand that it was just a movie and that the Easter Bunny will be fine.  We watched this movie the weekend before Easter.,1364774400,,230,4.181818181818182
4811343,4,B005LAIIFS,"This was entertaining for kids and adults can enjoy it as well.  It was sugary and sweet but struck the right balance with enough humor, discovery, and wonder as to not be inane for an adult audience.  It doesn't have as solid a story or message as many from the Pixar collection, or How to Train Your Dragon, but it was good enough to be better than OK.",1364688000,,354,4.1911764705882355
4811344,5,B005LAIIFS,Great movie. My six year old and I really enjoyed it.  Good story and some  really funny parts which helped to offset the darkness of the bogeyman.,1364688000,,147,4.407407407407407
4811345,5,B005LAIIFS,This was watched at our house on Easter day. The kids 5 & 8 loved it. Just a little cheering going on at the end...,1364688000,,115,3.64
4811346,5,B005LAIIFS,"I saw this movie when it was in theaters (not the 3D version) and it's AMAZING!
If I could, I would have gone back to see it over and over again. So lucky that
my birthday just passed and someone got it for me!

This movie is for all ages. I'm in my mid-twenties and just love this so much.
The kids and parents in the theater all laughed together and it's such an enjoyable
movie. You can't go wrong getting this!",1364688000,,414,4.048780487804878

4811408,4,B005LAIIFS,"I didn't expect too much from this, but I really enjoyed it, as did my whole family.  Lots and lots of laugh out loud moments, appropriate for all ages, held even the little ones' attention.  Would recommend it!",1364688000,,211,4.526315789473684
4811409,1,B005LAIIFS,I bought this special Easter dvd pack for my 5 year old son. It was supposed to be something the Easter bunny left for him. How disappointing to my son that the Easter bunny would leave him 2 hopping eggs that do not hop. How does one explain that to a 5 year old? I could have and should have bought local or not spent more for the special Easter pack.  And to exchange just the eggs seems impossible since my son loves the dvd and would not understand it being gone for awhile. Great! What a way to take a great day and make it one with a very sad little guy.,1364688000,,561,3.9646017699115044
4811410,5,B005LAIIFS,"Finding great family movies for everyone to watch when you have kids around 8-10 years are hard these days, but if them have the studio DreamWorks on them, that's a sign of quality. Their latest run of release is only rivaled by Pixar. This and ""How to Tain your Dragon"" have been a couple of the best movies ( not just family animation genre) that we've seen in a long time. I highly recommend it and its great purchasing on the Amazon on demand. It always available on our iPad or Xbox, I'm starting to love the convenience and pricing of the movies on Amazon, and having them in movie collection, and it everywhere you go. Very cool",1364688000,,635,4.389830508474576

4811548,4,B005LAIIFS,"Its like the super friends but with presents. Enjoyed most of the characters, but the Easter bunny was not that likable. Really liked the fact that Santa was Russian with tatts. Good for the kids and just enough innuendo for adults to snicker at.",1364601600,,246,4.613636363636363

4811553,5,B005LAIIFS,"IIt was a hit for a 3rd grade sleepover! The kids played the Guardians after the movie. Made us appreciate Jack Frost a little bit more after a winter of almost 70"" of snow and an unheard of 4 snow days.
I would recommend in HD, but I am only a novice in this area.",1364515200,,265,3.8363636363636364
4811554,5,B005LAIIFS,"If you want a warm, cute, action packed animated movie then look no further. Rise of the Guardians is a great movie. It is really clever in its plot lines and is really cute.

4811555,5,B005LAIIFS,"My almost 6 year old loves this movie more than any other we've watched together, and I have to say that my husband and I do too.  It's got engaging characters, excellent voice acting, a compelling story, lots of side humor, a good message and it's really visually stunning.  I'm so often just bored or annoyed by children's films.  For this one we were as engaged as our son.  Our family highly recommends this film!",1364515200,,417,4.52

Amazon defines ""Digital Copy"" as being the iTunes download and NOT the Ultraviolet download.  Be aware that this is labelled incorrectly, and that this version includes the Ultraviolet download and not the iTunes download.  This matters to me.  I was specifically looking for the iTunes download and do not want the Ultraviolet download.  I lost a little confidence in Amazon.",1364515200,6,463,5.12

Quite simply one of the best animated movies I've ever seen.
Santa, Jack Frost, The Tooth Fairy, The Sand Man and The Easter Bunny take on their arch nemesis The Boogie Man.
Some of the best fx I've ever seen bar none.
A brilliant but simple story line.
I liked it so much I ordered the 3d version and I CAN'T wait to see the 3d on my tv.
An amazing movie and a must see.

4811620,5,B005LAIIFS,"I fell in love with the movie during the trailers that's how cool it is.
The graphics and realism of this movie are beyond awe inspiring. Dreamworks definitely reaches higher levels with each movie that they release and this one is a prime example.

I would say that you'd have to have a really stiff mind to not feel like a kid again while watching this fantastic story unfold. Feel the real emotions during the ups and downs. Cheer when the guardians win a battle. Cry when their hearts are crushed. I dare you not be moved by this story while watching it. And I recommend getting the blu ray and DVD pack so that you can watch it with either system. I watched the blu ray on an HD TV and had my mind blown again it is so beautiful.

The little eggs that come with the limited edition are so simple that they are cute, even for adults. I don't have little kids but, I'm sure they would enjoy them just as much or more as I do.

A great collectors item, and if the other movie Hotel Transylvania is anything to go by, then getting this set will be a good idea, as soon as possible, because it will become increasingly harder to find the BR/DVD/Digital Copy sets with Easter Eggs.

Then I started hearing from alot of people that they had enjoyed it and they recommended it to me since I love animated films.  For the most part recent animated movies have been lackluster for me, ROTG  was not only enjoyable but very funny too. The storyline was great and creative and put a nice spin to characters we all know.  The voice characterization was phenomenal, and I fell in love with Jack's character. The movie had it all: comedy, adventure, but best of all it had heart.  Hopefully a sequel will me made, but I don't know how they will be able to top this one.",1364428800,,743,4.355072463768116

4811784,4,B005LAIIFS,"I want to first state how upset I am at Dreamworks subterfuge in their packaging of 3d version. It states up to 8.00 off the Croods movie ticket. That's it. I plopped down 30.00 big ones at Walmart the other day ONLY because of the 8.00 discount. Once home I was astounded to learn that it is only for a KID's ticket. Straight subterfuge slick tricks. WOW. Buyer beware. I would have waited for the price drop and will now be alert for other future releases by Dreamworks. OK enough ranting. The animation is simply superb, the picture amongst the very best CGI animes I have ever see. The True HD 7.1 is astoundingly good. This movie is all about lots and loads of eye candy. The voice talent as well is phenomenal with each actor from Baldwin to Jude Law and other greats really inhabiting their characters. Hugh was really perfect as an outback Bunny. The movie is great for younger viewers, but for adults I personally feel Wreck it Ralf, while simpler to a point, had a bit more heart but that's only my opinion. At the same time Wreck it's premise is much thinner than even this one...e.g. video game character compared to icons of folklore legend and their impact on children (almost everywhere).
  Still this is a great buy at 19.99 or less. A true keeper, especially if you have youngsters. Hats off to a terrific animation team and cast and director. Bravo.",1364428800,,1367,4.530364372469635

4811885,5,B005LAIIFS,"Overall I personally liked this movie a lot. Watched it with my 17-year old son and we both enjoyed it equally.

Just feel that I should warn folks that maybe don't know that there's a bit of violence in it. No blood or gore of course, but Santa is walking around with 2 swords and ""killing"" scary horses made out of the stuff of nightmares, the Easter Bunny is doing the same with a boomerang and so on. It also touches a little bit on death in the story line, but I won't post a spoiler with the details.

The gist of the story line is cute if a little formulaic. The boogeyman (named Pitch Black) is trying to get kids to not believe in the Guardians (Santa, Easter Bunny, Sandman and Tooth Fairy) by giving them nightmares. The Man in the Moon (or, as I see it, their representation of God) suggests that the Guardians let Jack Frost (a mischievous teenager who can fly, has various abilities around ice and cold and who has no idea of his past) join their team to help them. I'll outline the characters below so you can see how different they are from the norm:

Santa is Russian and has tattoos on his arms (""Naughty"" on one, ""Nice"" on the other). He also has Yeti working for him in the shops as well as elves (tiny critters who generally aren't as helpful as generally believed). Not your typical Santa as he's more of a ""tough guy"" but they do point out his gentle side and love for children and the ""wonder"" in all things.

The Easter Bunny is over 6' tall and has a bit of an attitude. He travels by making magical tunnels in the ground that lead to wherever he wants. He wields a boomerang and has an Australian accent. He starts off the movie not liking the idea of having Jack Frost join them (thinks he's just a trouble maker).

The Tooth Fairy is a bird-like woman who has thousands of little birds actually taking teeth and leaving rewards for children. These teeth hold the memories of the children in them so she safeguards them closely.

The Sandman never actually talks, communicates with his ability to shape magic (sand/the stuff of dreams/whatever) into different forms. Like when he is curious about something, a question mark will form above his head, etc. Interesting character, probably my favorite of the Guardians.

Jack Frost has a magical staff/stick that he uses to fly with and to shape/manipulate cold, ice, snow, etc. He likes to roam around and be mischievous, but he also has a strong love of children and enjoys giving them snow days, making their sled riding more fun and adventurous, etc. Nobody can see Jack Frost though, like they can see the other Guardians if they aren't careful.

The Boogeyman (Pitch Black) is a tall, dark, brooding character that can manipulate children's dreams and make them nightmares. His arch-enemy, while he of course works against any of the Guardians) is clearly the Sandman for obvious reasons. His goal is to get children to stop believing in the Guardians because if nobody believes in them any more then they lose their powers.

Overall the characters are well done and interesting, but quite different from the ""norm"" as you can see. If they weren't it wouldn't be a movie!

I recommend the movie, just suggest you consider the non-bloody violence if you are concerned about your child(ren) watching that.

We saw it in the theatre first and then got it through Amazon Prime for my 10 yr old's sleepover birthday party. Pitch is scary but not too scary.

4812008,5,B005LAIIFS,"When my family first heard about this movie, we were a little skeptical.  After seeing Dreamworks progress from pop-culture-laden parody flicks (such as the ""Shrek"" films, ""Shark Tale,"" and ""Bee Movie"") to well-done story-and-character driven films that could hold their own against Pixar's empire (""How To Train Your Dragon,"" ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and ""Megamind""), this somehow seemed a step backward.  Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy?  Somehow that failed to appeal to me.

On a recommendation from a friend, however, I brought the movie home from our library.  And our entire family was blown away.  This wasn't a fluffy kid's flick -- it was an epic fantasy with a boldly realized world and characters.

Based on William Joyce's ""Guardians of Childhood"" books, the world of this film is watched over by the Guardians -- immortal beings who protect and watch over the children of the world, fueled by their belief and in turn preserving the hope, wonder, dreams, and memories of childhood.  Said Guardians -- Nicholas St. North (Santa Claus), Bunnymund (the Easter Bunny), the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman -- are less than thrilled when their governing entity, the Man in the Moon, appoints a fifth Guardian... Jack Frost, a young trickster with no memory and no desire to be roped into a new responsibility.  But when a sinister threat rises to spread fear and darkness over the world -- Pitch Black, the Boogeyman -- it just may fall on the newest Guardian to stop him, help his new friends, and quite possibly save the world.

This film is one of the most visually impressive Dreamworks films yet.  The worlds of the various Guardians are imaginative and lushly depicted, with vibrant colors and memorable, dreamlike visuals.  And the characters themselves have been re-imagined quite well -- instead of fitting to the commercialized looks most people know, they've been modeled to fit right into this new fantasy world.  North is more reminiscent of an Old World Father Christmas, the Tooth Fairy wears an elaborate hummingbird-like ensemble, and Bunnymund looks more like a creature out of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" than a fluffy pastel-colored bunny, which is a good thing.

The re-imagining of the characters isn't just in their physical appearances -- they're each given their own unique personality, and they play well off of each other.  Jack, while mischievous and  frequently at odds with the others, is unexpectedly vulnerable at times, and is quite protective of those more helpless than he is.  North is an enthusiastic warrior, still jolly but also quite willing to deliver a smackdown when needed.  The Tooth Fairy is quite eccentric but well-meaning, and has an almost maternal attitude toward her comrades and charges.  The Sandman, mute but friendly, mostly plays straight man to the others, while Bunnymund is a gruff snarker with a well-guarded softer side.  (On a side note, Bunny is voiced by Hugh Jackman, officially making him the most awesome incarnation of the Easter Bunny EVER.)  Only Pitch is somewhat one-dimensional, though he's an effectively creepy villain and it's quite obvious that Jude Law thoroughly enjoyed voicing him.

Above all, though, I loved the concept of this movie -- that these familiar childhood icons not only make children happy, but protect them from the malevolent forces of the world.  It takes these icons and makes them into something epic, re-weaving the folklore into something worthy of mythology.  It may not do this perfectly, but it does it admirably and imaginatively, and I for one appreciate seeing a new side to some of the most beloved childhood figures in the world.

In short, this is what a Rankin-Bass holiday special would look like if directed by Joss Whedon and Hayao Miyazaki.  It's epic and badass, but still retains a sense of wonder and fun, and sets it in a uniquely beautiful, imaginatively designed world.  Probably a little too scary for young children (Pitch can be quite terrifying to the little ones -- I'd say age 7 and up), but even adults will find something to love and admire in this film.",1364169600,,4101,5.001472754050074

4812014,4,B005LAIIFS,"This movie is cute. Id say it leans towards adults and older children though. All the characters are edgier than in other stories surrounding them. Easter Bunny is a tough guy with a mouth,Santa is a tad strange,and Jack Frost is a misunderstood kid with a bad additude who doesnt remember who he is. Then,add in the BoogeyMan who wants to bring FEAR to every childs heart and destroy these Guardians of goodwil and its a little much for a toddler to watch. We had to turn it off and wait until my Granddaughter fell asleep to finish it. It was cute,just not a little kids movie.",1364169600,,579,4.420560747663552

The characters of the Guardians are interesting variants on the usual Santa Claus and Easter bunny types and all the more enjoyable because of it.",1364083200,,316,4.833333333333333

My roommate and I went to see this movie a couple of times in the theater, just because we liked it that much. As goofy as it sounds, it reminded me of the stuff I used to believe in as a child, and that it really never hurts to continue believing in stuff (within reason, of course). Either way, the movie is good, it's funny, it's emotional. It's a good family movie.",1364083200,,534,4.095238095238095

4812204,4,B005LAIIFS,"The story idea is interesting and its cool to see how the mythical beings for the days of yore are shown in todays light.
This may help to educate children on the existence of these stories, if they never heard of them.
The villain, though, is a bit too predictable and I think they could have refined him.
Adults will find some hidden adult humor in the story too.",1364083200,,365,4.304347826086956

Much like Wreck it Ralph this was a surprising hit.  We need more films like this with great animation, humor that all can appreciate, and story lines and characters with enough depth to keep you interested.  This one is also watched many times in our home.",1364083200,,497,4.358695652173913

We just shared this movie with friends who have children ranging from 2 to 6 with rave reviews as well. It reminds children to BELIEVE as well as encourages them to conquer their fears. It shows them that THEY are in charge of what they are afraid of, fear is not stronger that belief. I just love the animation, the fun spin on traditions and ideas...who ken that, THAT was how all those eggs were hidden at Easter?!

Every so often, we rent a movie where the streaming is so on and off again that eventually we end up leaving the room or switching on our Hulu or Netflix. We never even got to enjoy this $5 movie for a full 15 min without an interruption!!!",1363910400,,356,4.25
4812335,4,B005LAIIFS,"I bought this movie for two reasons:
1. 3D
2. Need a movie to watch with the kids.

The 3D was great! It wasn't abused like in some movies where they push 3D for the sole sake of selling the movie.  The storytelling was decent and the acting was reasonably done.

I don't give it 5 stars because I don't think it will become a children's classic as many other believe.  However, I do believe it is worth watching and owning.  The characters have unique personalities and provide for an interesting combination. I personally found Santa Claus a little too unconventional. Alec Baldwin made him far more aggressive than I believe Santa would ever be.. but perhaps I am guilty of years of cultural indoctrination.  Regardless, I still found Santa amusing and worth watching.

I also liked that the movie was not too scary. If you are looking for a ""scary"" children's reference, I would say Disneys, ""The Black Cauldron"" was far more foreboding. I would rate the level of creepiness from the villain (The Boogie Man) as mild. I found other characters such as Cruella de Vil and the witch from Snow White far scarier.",1363910400,2,1112,4.642857142857143

Santa is funny, well voiced by Alex Baldwin (and I'm not a fan of his, so that saying something) Hugh Jackman as the Easter Bunny is my favorite, he's got that little attitude that is funny to me.  My only concern for parents with little kids is the Boogie Man.  I don't want to do spoilers or anything like that, but I can see where some kids may find his character scary, I thought for sure my daughter would be as a 6 year old but she wasn't.

My husband and I were laughing and just having FUN!!  The only negative I have to say, and it isn't even truly negative, is that after watching it once, I wanted to watch it a second time because I felt like there was a lot going on.  But we watched it again the next night and were delighted once more...plus we picked up on some stuff we missed the first time.  Anyway.  Awesome movie.

From an adult perspective, the storyline is intriguing in that these guardians are out there to protect children from fear. There were several scenes where the characters discuss the importance of protecting the children because they are the future and no one wants to live in a future filled with fear.

4812603,5,B005LAIIFS,I loved the movie.  I watched it with children who ranged from ages 14 to 2 and they laughed and enjoyed this movie a lot.  The message was very uplifting and the characters were great.  No foul language or sexual innuendos.. Finally a great family film that has a message and offers great laughs for every age in the family. 2 thumbs up!,1363737600,,338,4.333333333333333

4812605,5,B005LAIIFS,"Such a great movie! We watched it (two 58 yr old grandparents) with our 5 year old, 9 year old and 11 year old grandsons.  We ALL loved it!! We had one small discussion about having bad dreams when my 5 year old grandson said HE had bad dreams too, after watching Pitch change the adorable unicorn dream to a pretty scary black stallion! At that point I said I'd give him the Dreamcatcher that hangs in his room at my house to take home, between the really good feelings you get from the movie and the dreamcatcher, he's bad dream free since!  Each character was so well thought out, so many small details that made it a complete experience, the best Movie I've seen lately!",1363737600,,674,4.341269841269841

4812704,4,B005LAIIFS,"My five year old and I sat together and watched the movie from beginning to end with minimal interruptions, which as anyone that has had a five year old can attest, is no small thing. There was enough adult humor hidden in the subtext to keep it entertaining for me, and my five year old loved the spin placed on Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman and the Tooth Fairy. Overall, a great family movie.

Word of warning - - be prepared to talk about whether all the characters are real or not, and whether or not YOU believe. I do, so it was no problem for me, but for all you skeptics/haters out there who are just letting your kids believe because that's what you're supposed to do, get your response ready before playing the movie, because the topic will come up.",1363737600,2,765,4.34965034965035

4812776,1,B005LAIIFS,"As an adult that loves kids movies and cartoons, I was hoping this movie would be one for all ages. But great graphics and an excellent cast couldn't keep this flick from anything but mind-numbing and slightly annoying. It's 'warm' message takes you and the family all the way to the bank- believe in anything sensational regardless of plot and originality.  This is a big budget, twisted ADHD version of Peter Pan. Kids of the world must believe or the main characters will die, all the lights have gone out so everyone clap their hands and waste your money renting this film. I would rate it age appropriate 0-5. If you want a great animated movie, with a great plot and message, spend a buck less on Wreck it Ralph. Btw, did anyone catch the Jurassic Park reference complete with a trumpet rip off of its theme song in the second to last scene? That and Santa using the word ""epic"" dropped my score from 2 stars.",1363651200,8,915,4.479041916167665

4812780,5,B005LAIIFS,"I loved this movie, got it on a whim after the tumblr backlash that came with it. Movie was just what Dreamworks is really good at very family friendly with some darker material thrown in for the ""bigger kids."" The animation was astounding I loved it they did a really good job with the detail. I will be watching this a lot.",1363651200,,325,4.258064516129032
4812781,2,B005LAIIFS,I will probably send this back. Had trouble with both discs. The Blu-Ray disc would not play in our player but the regular disc did. The next day we took to to someone's house to play it and the regular disc would not play all the way through. Such a shame since the movie is actually a good movie.,1363651200,,298,4.067796610169491
4812782,5,B005LAIIFS,My kids loved this movie when it released so I decided to add it to my blu ray collection. Great Special feature that my children enjoyed like the two games and to top it off we love the movie.,1363651200,,193,3.9743589743589745

4812784,3,B005LAIIFS,I only gave this movie 3 stars because (in my opinion) it had TOO MUCH action in it and not enough humor and plot!! I did not like the characters...the Easter bunny- from Australia? And the tooth fairy looked like a peacock!! I am a 34 year old and I had a hard time staying engaged in the movie!,1363564800,,296,4.033898305084746
4812785,5,B005LAIIFS,"This movie is fantastic!! Most holiday movies always depict the characters the same way. A fat jolly Santa, a small white easter bunny, a frilly pink tooth fairy. So this version is amazing. It's so different. Also the graphics in this movie are incredible.

It's super fun to watch for both kids and adults. Hilarious movie but also touching. Highly recommend this movie!!",1363564800,,373,4.920634920634921
4812836,4,B005LAIIFS,"the moon told me to write this review.
The real star of the movie was the yeti. I think the yeti should have it's own movie.
The movie was kind of sappy, but in general it was okay.",1363564800,,181,3.789473684210526
4812837,5,B005LAIIFS,"We got this movie for our family movie night, and it was really great! My four-year-old son loved it, and recognized Santa and the Easter Bunny. Our teenage daughter enjoyed it as well, and my husband and I liked it enough that we didn't protest when our son wanted to watch it again the next day. There are some inside jokes that just the adults got, but they weren't offensive at all, just funny. I loved that the story wasn't just empty entertainment either, but had a good message about hope, wonder, family, and overcoming fear.",1363564800,,533,4.5625
4812838,5,B005LAIIFS,It had a good story line - good vs. evil.  My son is 16 and even he enjoyed it and thought it funny.  Young kids may be frightened by boogeyman and his black horses.,1363564800,,165,3.823529411764706
4812839,5,B005LAIIFS,"Our family (including the 3 year old) really enjoyed this movie. A new twist on all the familiar holiday characters keeps this movie fresh, and the humor is spot on. We rented it this time, but will be purchasing soon!",1363564800,,218,4.475

4812842,5,B005LAIIFS,"When this movie came out at the theaters I was turned off by the ""strange"" appearance of the beloved Easter Bunny and Santa Claus.  My mistake missing this one on the big screen.  We recently rented it and we all fell in love with Jack Frost, the bad*ss Easter Bunny and especially with Baby Tooth.  Seriously, there's a reason this movie has so many 5-star reviews. Where was the buzz?  Not sure why this wasn't bigger at the theaters.  Maybe other people were turned off initially like I was.  Watch it.  You'll love it.  And remember, it's a PG movie, not G, so expect some excitement that might frighten a small child.  Mine are 10, 8 and two 7s.",1363564800,,650,4.394957983193278

4812901,3,B005LAIIFS,Too scary for my children - 5 and 8. I didn't care for it. Didnt like the way some of the characters were portrayed. Didnt like the scary dream theme.,1363564800,,150,4.033333333333333
4812902,5,B005LAIIFS,The Rise of the Guardians is not you normal Santa Claus story. Great character development for a children's movie. Nice action. My 5 year old boy enjoyed it. You will love Sandman.,1363564800,,180,4.65625

4812958,5,B005LAIIFS,"Russian, sword-wielding Santa, Australian outback Easter Bunny, a very powerful sandman and a tooth-fairy hummingbird? This movie does not hold back when it comes to being unique and original. Create a portal by wishing into a magic ball -toss- and then fly through your creation. Take a ride on Santa's insane sleigh.

But watch out because the Boogie Man, Pitch Black, is tired of being a figment of people's imagination.

In his quest to be acknowledged, the Boogie man has found a way to harness and manipulate nightmares. His plan is to rule the world and then (must watch movie) yada yada yada its all good and there is a new guardian to thank.

With a new twist on old characters, this has something in it for older and younger folk.",1363478400,,740,4.633587786259542

4812963,5,B005LAIIFS,"This is an excellent computer animation film from the minds of the artists of Dream Works. The storyline and graphics are nicely done and it is a very enjoyable film to watch with your children or grandchildren. Evil has returned to the world as the Bogeyman (Pitch Black) returns and he wants the recognition the way thinks he deserves it. He is jealous of Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman and all the attention they receive from the children of the world.

His new weapon is using his nightmares to give the children bad dreams and to slowly steal the powers of the Guardians so he can become a major force in the lives of children. Jack Frost is called upon to become a guardian and to help stop the Bogeyman. He doesn't want to help as he himself is not really recognized or appreciated by enough kids and he struggles with the concept of helping those Guardians who are loved by children. Jack has to choose sides, does he want to be loved or feared? What is his center of life about...

This is an excellent story and the animation is just top notch. We watched it with our grandson and he enjoyed it a lot. We had recently watched several movies and this was his favorite of the movies we have just seen. We rated it as a 5 star movie for the family and your younger children will love it. This is great family entertainment; children and adults will appreciate the story and the beauty of this film.",1363478400,,1431,4.39622641509434

4813136,5,B005LAIIFS,"Arrived on time and as expected; package had been abused a bit but the contents were in perfect shape.  Good job on the packaging, Amazon!

The good parts of this review: The eggs are too cute. The movie comes with Blu-Ray, Standard DVD, and a Digital copy unlocked by using Ultraviolet.  While i don't use Ultraviolet because their system was still buggy when I first bought something that used it (Green Lantern) and I still have problems getting through their system, I don't need the digital copy at this time.  Because it's not necessary to my enjoyment, I only detract a half-star and cannot 'round down' here, so.  This is generally a good packaging of a very good movie.  I'm not going to review the movie itself... well, OK, a little.

The cultural characters of Santa Claus, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, all came from a series of beautifully illustrated, fanciful children's books, by William Joyce, which are described here at this website: [...]

Joyce recreates the characters completely from their embed in real human historical things - there is no Saint Nicholas of Myra in this Santa, there is no rabbit of the Goddess of Spring in the Easter Bunny, there is no analysis of why Christmas or Easter deserve prominence, because it's not about the religious background.

For some people this will be bad. For others this will be good. Until I knew that this was from a series of stories, I didn't know that it wasn't just a deliberate removal of the religious background from two of these characters, but the focus of the movie was on the extremely engaging character of Jack Frost, voiced by Chris Pine.  So far as I know Jack Frost is not part of the books (yet).

Jack Frost is intangible and inaudible except in the way he exerts his power of cold, because nobody believes in him. He's a ""bad boy"" - a very mischievous youth (at 317) who was changed by the Man in the Moon - another character from the original books, who appears in the movie only as the full moon, and never speaks aloud so that we can hear him.

The movie tells three stories.  The first is a story of Jack Frost - the young man whose delight in the fun of living is being eroded by the constant reminder that he is not 'real' to the people around him.  He knows he was made by the Man in the Moon, but doesn't know anything about himself from the moment he awoke underwater in a partially-frozen pond, dragged out of the fear and the dark by the brightness of the moon. His coming into himself is the first story; the second is his becoming, and being accepted, as a Guardian of Childhood, one of the elite mythical beings who inspire the positive feelings of childhood.
The third story is that of 'the boogy man' - Pitch, the Nightmare King, ruler of darkness of fear and doubt and pain who wants to spread them over the world, who has slowly grown stronger since his last defeat. He has returned, and he has everything he needs to overcome the Four Guardians... except for this interloper Jack Frost, who isn't sure he wants the job of Fifth Guardian.

Even if you don't like the secularization - the story is filled with positive, uplifting narrative, with strong moral values.

The packaging is cute, though a bit disposable, and the eggs are amusing.
Now for the less thrilling aspects, the production of the Blu-Ray disk and the content wrapper.  You may skip this if you don't enjoy rants, because I do rant a bit there at the end.

There were two ""interactive games"" and a number of language subtitle options, including director's information, which I will be exploring later.  For now, though?  The movie was good, and all I needed was to make popcorn to make it as enjoyable as the movie theatre experience.  Playback was not as simple as it should have been.

Fortunately, I watch blu-ray movies using a blu-ray drive on my personal computer.

As happens with many Blu-Ray products, I once again had to upgrade my commercial Blu-Ray software because in the never-ending paranoid attempt to explain to us how we're all thieves, the movie industry has made it yet again a format incompatible with my previous software.  At this point, I suspect that any Blu-Ray player I would have purchased before last year would be worthless to play this movie.  Further, they hammer the viewer with several mandatory warnings, threats, and bluster-fests wherein they explain that the world is ending because people don't respect copyright.  It must be fun living in a world where everyone caters to your whims and terribly upsetting when they stop putting up with you (and I'm talking to the Studio people here) but in the real world, people don't respect people who start out by showing their own disrespect in the first place.

Make stuff available that people want and they will pay well to see it. Make crap and people will probably pay what it's worth.
Make good stuff unavailable, and people will find a way to get it.  That's been true for as long as recorded civilization.

The FBI warning? Unnecessary, reading it doesn't make me do anything but resent you.
The bit at the end with the earnest message of  ""how you can go educate yourself (because you're obviously an ignorant pirate) about how PIRACY has been destroying our ECONOMY"" ... uhm, yah, no.
What's been destroying our economy is a combination of things involving greed and overreaching, but one big part of it has been fraudulent acts on the part of banks that grossly inflated then collapsed a major part of our economy to below the point before the inflation was started.  That's an entirely different kind of piracy.

But I promise that I won't take the DVD and Blu-Ray disks that I just PURCHASED for MONEY and make copies of them for everyone else, if you promise to start looking at realistic ways to make piracy not worth it, by making it easier to get your stuff and by making it easy for people to pay you what they feel it's worth - and that's usually more than you'd get otherwise if it's any good.

Momma's response: She really does love this movie and asks for it constantly. I have to say I love it too.  The animation is awesome and the music works perfectly.  Jack is a reluctant hero, but absolutely a hero.  The balance of what each Guardian brings to the world is lovely, and the balances of the different Guardians across the world interesting, though that aspect went right over my little one's head. And I want to be careful not to spoil, but Jamie/Frost's interactions rock - esp near the end.  I don't know what the plot would be, but I hope there's a Rise of the Guardians 2 in the works somewhere. We would absolutely buy it.",1363219200,,838,4.265822784810126

However, I still really, really wanted to see it and I'm glad I did.  Rise of the Guardians is an amazing movie.  While some of the dialog is a bit cheesy, it is excusable because it is a kids' film.

4813243,5,B005LAIIFS,"This film is pretty much fun and entertaining, Rise of the Guardians had a sad misfortune of being a Box Office disappointment at losses at $87 million which makes it Dreamworks Animation's rare box office disappointment as the first unsuccessful financially since Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas despite a promotional selling that it would be a hard sell for very younger children and the getting of Santa being Russian with tattoos and swords with the makings of being the next How to Train Your Dragon and Award season buzz. It's much better than the critics say about it!

I really wanted to see a sequel of this it had the makings of a franchise, it's a amazingly underrated film that they tried really hard to make this a brand new franchise. This film will go down in one of the underrated and under-seen animated movies like Treasure Planet and Titan A.E. and The Black Cauldron as a cult favorite in the next ten years.

This is one the best Dreamworks Animation movies that has seen outside Shrek ever! Let us get out and buy this so we can still get the chance for a second film!",1363132800,,1091,4.532994923857868

4813286,5,B005LAIIFS,"Disney films for the last 10 years or so have just been awful.  Well, the animated ones anyway... and with only 3 exceptions that come to mind.  (Wall-e, Bolt, and Monsters,Inc.)  Thankfully, we have Dreamworks, who has not only picked up the slack; but has vastly surpassed them in both Quality and Entertainment for ALL Ages, and left Disney Animation coughing on their pixel-dust!  (no, not a type-o... Pixel Dust, haha)  (and did Disney even own Pixar when Monsters, Inc. came out???)

The last 10 years for Dreamworks however, have been awesome, with only a couple ""misses"".  They've brought us Kung-Fu Panda (and a Super-Killer sequel)... How To Train Your Dragon... Monsters Vs Aliens... Megamind... Puss In Boots (loved it / didn't like the Shreks personally)... and many others... And now they've added this Disney-knock-out punch, Rise of The Guardians.

Kind of makes you wonder what the Hell is wrong with Disney... And why they can't ever seem to get their act together, for more than 3-4 films, out of every 30 they release.  Aside from the ""classics"" (which I never really cared for all that much), their BEST films, ever, animation-wise, are unquestionably, The Little Mermaid (#1), The Lion King (#2), and Wall-e (#3)... Though obviously, many will disagree with the placement with 1 or all... But... Story, Originality, FUN (EVERY TIME), Engaging & Entertaining FOR ALL AGES... When looked at through that lens, I'm sure most will agree.  (Sorry; but Beauty & The Beast, is not top 10... way too many story/plot holes -- The ""age of the prince"" being the most glaring, with ""convenient (sloppy) writing"" throughout, and most of the songs are neither catchy, nor even good.  The Little Mermaid should've won the award(s), w/o a doubt, not B&TB... but since TLM didn't; and the co-composer who did both, died (of aids), they gave him the posthumous-pity-award to make up for it, plain and simple.)

Rise of The Guardians, is the kind of film, you'd expect (or at least, USE to expect) Disney to create... something that speaks to the child in all of us, yet is still greatly engaging & entertaining for all ages...
-- These days, Disney can barely put a decent story together, let alone, create something with the above characteristics.  And while, many of the Dreamworks films (like Monsters vs Aliens, Megamind, H.T.T.Y.D., etc.) are certainly not going to be on anyone's ""top 10 list""... they still kick the butt of anything Disney has made in recent past, w/ the exception of Wall-e of course, as that is in my ""top 3"" obviously.

Best of all, regarding this film... IT'S ORIGINAL.  They didn't take some ""classic fairy tale"" & put a weird twist on it, then take all the credit for the story (as was Disney's custom & how they built their 'empire').  Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-Disney... Hell, I'm a member of their Reward Program; and LOVE more than a few of their movies; and have upgraded (most) to 3D!... But, that's not going to keep me from calling a spade a spade... And honestly, Disney has Sold Us Out For Far Too Long... whether that be through bad Managers, or complacent Animators... I'm pretty sick of it either way... So, THANK YOU, DREAMWORKS!!

PS: I'm rather urked that they made Santa Claus RUSSIAN???  WTF!?
-- Making the Easter Bunny, Australian, is one thing... Whatever... You want the ""cast"" to be ""International""... I get it... But when you think of Christmas, the LAST Country that comes to mind, is RUSSIA!! _ Plus, you'd have to completely discount the actual, GERMAN, beginnings/heritage of Santa Claus... (CLAUS, HELLO!!)... which would've lent itself to your ""International"" theme... and therefore makes NO sense, and no explanation is even attempted, as to why he's Russian, or why the Bunny is an Aussie.  (or why he has Russian-style tattoos all over his arms)
--I don't know... that really, really bugged me... But, by the end of the film, I was so pleased with everything else, I figured 'why get hung up?'.  A lesser film, and that definitely would've been a coffin-nail (no-sale)... So, if you can get past that (and try not to think about it), you should enjoy this film, immensely... so, Enjoy!",1363132800,,4159,4.839210155148096
4813287,5,B005LAIIFS,"We took my daughter almost five to see this in the theaters around Thanksgiving and she loved it.

After getting it today and watching it again with her she had a blast with it, cheering at the end, a little scared in the middle but enjoying the story.  Since we originally saw it, I have read the Guardian books to her and she loves them.

  It is your typical good vs. bad story and overcoming something to find out who you really are.  The animation was good, I don't have a 3d Tv so o idea on that, but the blu-ray had a great picture.  Haven't checked out the bonus features yet.

4813367,5,B005LAIIFS,"While it is true that this is a great film for younger children, allow me to speak on behalf of the older generation.

I'm a theatre major in college who has done many a script and character analysis. The biggest thing that sticks out for me is Jack's story.

The way it is told is not the cheesy kid's movie cliche of, ""Oh, woe is me! I must find where I belong even though it seems to the audience  that I already know who I am for the most part. But I'll act sad and longing anyway because that's what's needed for this plot line to carry forward.""

This poor kid woke up out of the blue knowing NOTHING about himself and had to make up the rules as he went along for 400 years.  He had to live 400 years as a lonely soul who no one knew existed. And although he managed to make the most of it during that time, there was always a part of him that wondered why he got stuck in his situation in the first place. Only later, does he realize that the answer was always there to not only HOW he got where he was, but to his life before that he ever even knew existed! But just when he realizes he had a childhood, the answer gets taken away. OF COURSE he wants the truth! OF COURSE he'll be willing to fight for it. And then to finally be recognized by that little boy for the good he does in the world? Goddammit, that's gotta feel good.

Pretty complex stuff for a kids movie.",1362528000,,1377,4.0256410256410255

4813414,4,B005LAIIFS,"When 'Rise of the Guardians' came out in theaters, my 10 year-old daughter and 16 year-old son declined the chance to see it...despite being animation junkies. The reason was simple: all of the studio's ads and marketing made it clear that this was aimed at little kids. Funny thing, though...when those little kids and their parents went to see it, they weren't too pleased; and, the movie underperformed at the box office.
After watching it at home, its easy to understand why:

This is an action movie, with some serious themes (death, self-image, resurrection, revenge), and a particularly scary villain.
As such, it would have scared the daylights out of most tots. However, my kids and I found the animation imaginative, the concept of Holiday-Icon-As-Superhero to be refreshing, the voice acting superb and the action set-pieces to be stirring.

That said, there is a real problem with the film's own self-image. It veers wildly from giddy/silly into (very) dark/dangerous and back again; and, often without a logical reason why. Had the film spent more time telling its story, instead of trying to simply entertain, it might have been a classic.

Regardless, this is a worthwhile investment for any fan of good animated movies and/or their kids (ages 10 & up).
Chris Pine and Jude Law (as Jack Frost and Pitch Black the Boogieman) bring depth and emotion to their characterizations; and, both Alec Baldwin and Hugh Jackman are a scream in their roles of North (Santa) and the Easter Bunny.

I strongly recommend 'Rise of the Guardians'",1362441600,3,1543,4.992217898832685

To make it even a little more magical, it snowed last night and my daughter was soooo excited to wake up and realize that Jack Frost had come to visit. The overall moral of the story is that there is fear in the world, just there is no need to be scared of it.

Everything was going well, but then it felt like they just ended the film in a sudden moment. For what was suppose to be the climax of the film, the final battle was a bit too quick and lackluster for my taste.

Despite the rushed ending, it's an enjoyable family film, and kids will have a great time watching it.

Writers:  David Lindsay Abaire (screenplay) William Joyce (book)

Cast:  (voiced by)

Hugh Jackman, Alec Baldwin, Isla Fisher

An evil spirit named Pitch plans to destroy the hopes and dreams of children. For the first time, the Guardians (Santa, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, The Sandman and their newest member, Jack Frost) must work together to save themselves and the future of the world.

2012 was a banner year for animation. ParaNorman, Hotel Transylvania, Frankenweenie, Brave, just to name a few. Rise of the Guardians, which is based on William Joyce's multi-book young adult series, is one of the best. I can't say that I have every kid's anime film made, but my movie collection includes plenty and I've been known to watch them on Saturday mornings instead of the cartoon fare.

Casting was well done. The voices fit their characters and it's obvious the actors were into their roles. Animation brought life to the screen. I saw this film in the theaters and immediately went searching for a pre-order. I've actually started reading the books as well. I'm so fond of Rise of the Guardians, I'm adding the film to my annual Christmas viewing.

Overall, I seriously hope to see more films from this franchise in the future.

4813591,5,B005LAIIFS,"On Thanksgiving week-end, my ten-year-old nagged me to go see ""Rise of the Guardians"".  My response was ""No way, I didn't like that first owl movie"".  But he persisted and I so I grudgingly took him to a movie I had never heard of and which turned out to be not about animated owls at all.  Two hours later I left the theater thoroughly enchanted.  An animated ""kids"" movie had made me laugh, had me sitting at the edge of my seat, gaze in wonder and ultimately moved me to tears.  Since then I've taken my sons three times and counting - and we keep enjoying every minute of it.

""Rise of the Guardians"" is visually and creatively stunning.  The story of our childhood icons battling fear seems so simple, but it is told in a way that not only captures kids' imaginations, but also helps cynical adults get in touch with that inner child hiding somewhere inside.  This is not just a kid's movie.  This is a movie for all ages...  In our house it's already a classic.

4813646,5,B005LAIIFS,"A great and ancient evil is rising in the land, and it is up to the guardians-Santa Claus, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny-to convince the reluctant Jack Frost to fight for the innocence and imagination of the children of the world

The quirky premise leads into an enchanting tale of faith and self-discovery. Jack Frost, whose heart is as warm as his magical powers are cold, is the reluctant Guardian-elect. Invisible to children, bereft of memories, and unclear as to his purpose, he wanders through life making mischief (the Easter Bunny is still deeply unhappy about the blizzard on the Easter of '64) and racking up more naughty than nice points. But when Pitch Black, the boogeyman, schemes to wipe out the faith of children in Santa Claus and the other Guardians, Jack Frost teams up with the Guardians to bring laughter and joy back to the children of the world. In the process, naturally, he finds himself and his innermost gift.

The premise and plot, though simple, is beautifully written and wonderfully presented. The animation is dazzling and exciting (I'd be first in line for the ice-slicked roller coaster ride through the town, as seen in an early action scene) and the characters are charming and international in their appeal. Santa Claus speaks with a Russian accent and wields double blades. The Easter Bunny is over-sized at eight feet; he wields a boomerang and speaks Australian-ese. It would have been too much, I suppose, to hope that the Sandman would look like Morpheus from Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, but little Sandy kicked some serious booty with his Indiana Jones-style whips. The Tooth Fairy smiles too much; she raves and swoons over pearly white teeth. Jack Frost is at turns whimsically charming and heartbreakingly lonely.

Rise of the Guardians will appeal to any young child who still believes, children/adults of any age who want to believe, and cynical adults (like me) who don't believe but who can appreciate a great story and awesome animation.",1359158400,58,2013,4.949704142011834

This movie barely made over 100 million domestically and that is just sad. The trailers had me hooked from the beginning with a great concept. Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy, and Jack Frost all team up to take on the Boogy Man. It's basically an animated version of the Avengers, with childhood heroes instead.  And the movie worked. 2012 has been a really good year for animation, Pirates: A Band of Misfits, Brave, Hotel Transylvania, Madagascar 3, and of course Wreck it Ralph, were all very entertaining animated films this year. I believe Rise of the Guardians is up there with Wreck it Ralph as the best of the lot. Hopefully the movie catches on  on Blu Ray and DVD because this will be a Blu Ray we will watch quite frequently in our house. This is going to be a great Easter present for my 7 year old daughter.

I was entertained by the whimsy of the story, the ""I have a purpose"" storyline, and some of the Russian-Santa gags were pretty funny. Enjoy!",1357776000,,376,4.514705882352941

I just love how they made the mythical beings from my childhood become awesome butt-kicking superheroes!

Watch this movie to find out! Yes Santa has Tattoos and welds big swords, and the Easter Bunny is a Bad-A** but the characters are done perfectly. We all have layers to our souls and we are all perfect the way we are. Beautiful Movie- Perfect for the Family.

4813742,3,B005LAIIFS,"It was 'ok' for me. Think I expected a bit more. Watched it with family.
Believe for family also was 'ok', based on reactions and laughs.

The artwork and animation are superb. Really really good. Vibrant colors, vibrant characters, vibrant scenes,... lot going on for art and animations. Story was also good. But for me the movie misses on humor, jokes and laughs, we use to get from other movies. There are some, maybe several, but for mu just not enough, and not as good. Also, my mind couldn't stop wondering about the accent of the characters. Especially Santa's accent.

I don't know. I wasn't so exited with this movie. I suppose that's basically because I like other animation movies more. Most of Pixar for example, but also others, prior to Guardians, a few weeks ago we saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hotel-Transylvania-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy/dp/B0034G4OYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hotel Transylvania (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)</a>. I liked Hotel Transylvania much more.
The Guardians was just 'ok' for me. But I'd say enjoy the good parts, sit back, relax enjoy the good parts, especially the artwork and animation.

Our 8 yol liked the characters, I think he liked Sandman the most.
I think because Sandman seems the fun character between the guardians, while still being able to kick #ss! (battle with Pitch). He liked the scene where Sandman and Pitch were battling (me too, great animation right there). And I think also because of the glittering sparkling dust. It's kind of captivating.

He also liked the joke of the giants coloring the robots blue, and later the eggs red, and later,...",1357171200,5,1660,5.3486590038314175
4813743,5,B005LAIIFS,"What can I say about this movie that explains how amazing it is? I don't think words can even describe how amazing this movie is. I am a 15 year old boy and love animated movies. I can't get enough of them. I love what Dreamworks has done in the last 4 years. They have stepped it up and brought us Megamind, How to Train Your Dragon, and now Rise of the Guardians. I think they really captured each character perfectly. Jack Frost, Santa (North), Easter Bunny, Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy. This movie made me believe in these characters and made me feel like a kid again. It was dark a certain parts, but that is what is different about Dreamworks movies. They always have a sense of darkness in their new movies, that I really love. I don't really call them kids movies, I call them just animated movies. Labeling them as kids movies to me would be wrong. The story in Rise of the Guardians was fantastic and sad at times. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say be prepared to be surprised and shocked. This movie was visually stunning in 3D. If you are going to go see it, see it in 3D if you can. You will not be disappointed. The voice acting is brilliant and each actor and actress fits the role perfect. Many people thought Chris Pine's voice would not fit Jack Frost, but I think it fit perfectly. All the actors brought the characters alive and gave them a since of realize that make you believe they are even more real. Why do I give it a 10 out of 10, well because it deserves the best rating for making me believe and feel like a kid again. Not any other movie has ever done that before. Go see it for sure, even if you don't have kids to bring with you.",1357084800,2,1679,4.185185185185185

Usually she fidgets, needs to go to the bathroom several times and talks through the whole movie. We had to keep checking that she was still next to us she was so quiet. She was just mesmerized and when we left she told us we needed to buy this movie when it came out. Wow!!! Great movie",1356998400,28,420,4.072289156626506

It was so nice to see new charcters, The Sandman was an amazing stroke of imagination. The Easter Bunny played by Hugh Jackman with his real Aussie accent was amazingly funny.

The second you see Jack Frost your heart melts for him and you fall head over heels in love with this enchanting young boy voiced by Chris Pine.

Santa was great as well as the Tooth Fairy and her little helpers.

There was nothing in this movie I wasn't in awe with. The little girl and her strewn about hair seemed so REAL!!!!

I believe it was Dreamworks, right? They hit it out of the ball park with this one and into the bay (think Giants stadium, lol)

I am preordering it so we can watch it the day it comes out.

4813828,3,B005LAIIFS,"Saw this movie today because my family wanted to do something different for the holidays. I expected to hate it primarily because I was never raised to believe in any of the characters in it(That's not to say I wasn't familiar with the supposed lore behind at least four of them) and never could understand why parents would ever tell  their children about them but even things you consider stupid can be weaved into a beautifully depicted story. SPOILER ALERT! The main Character is  called Jack Frost, Originally he was a young man born in primitive (Not prehistoric) times who saved his sister from falling through thin ice at the cost of his own life. He is reincarnated  into Jack Frost  but loses his memories of his previous life. All he knows is his name which he claims to know because  the man in the moon told him so. He causes all sorts of mischeif around town with the powers of frost he weilds but can never be seen or felt by any of the children or adults. Later  he discovers that he cannot be seen by  the children because they don't believe in him.  Meanwhile  an ancient evil  reawakens  and begins his plot to eliminate his rivals  by causing children all over the world to cease believing in the easter bunny, Santa, the tooth fairy and the sandman as well as start believing in the boogeyman again. In light of this the man in the moon  elects a reluctant Jack Frost to be a guardian.

Enough summary. Now for the reasons I gave this movie three stars amnd not five.

Firstly, It blatantly contradicts itself over and over again. The gaurdians  and all other  fairytale helpers are specifically said to exist only as long as they're believed in but both jack and the boogeyman haven't been believed in for over 300 years so why didn't  cease to exist after all that time???. We see immediate  effects when just a few children stop believing in the Easter bunny and the tooth fairy but the boogeyman and Jack have existed pretty long without anyone's belief. I know that people are going to tell me that the belief rule only exists as long as you're a gaurdian but even when Jack was a guardian nobody believed in him until the movie was almost over.

Secondly, the movie contradicts it's own supposed message if it even had one. If s something needs to be believed in to exist then it really doesn't exist at all aside from in the mind and yet Jack Frost  and the boogeyman really exist but they don't.  It makes no sense.

Thirdly, I like the moon and stars and all but making the man in the moon a diety was a bit much for me. I didn't really care until Jack adresses the audience at the very end of the movie and says.  ""My name is Jack Frost. How do I know? because the moon told me so. So when the moon tells you something, listen.""

Really?!!

Fourth. The tooth fairys design. Ick. Looks like a cross between a hummingbird, a peacock and a beetle.  She's the tooth fairy for pete's sake. This isn't ex men or fern gully.

Aside from that the story is entertaining, the graphics are beautiful and it's a great film.",1356393600,10,3042,4.412926391382406
4813829,5,B005LAIIFS,"Ok....so I am not a kid, nor do I have any. I am an aspiring artist who happens to love anything that is animated. which is sad I know, but Que Sera Sera. I loved this movie a tad bit to much for my age lol. If you have liked movies like ""how to train your dragon"" or ""hotel translavania"" (very funny movie btw) then you will like ""Rise of the Guardians"".",1355875200,4,355,3.9444444444444446

Santa-- or ""North"" as he was in this movie-- as a Cossack Warrior (Alec Baldwin)

Jack Frost as the star-- kind of the teenage rebel of the group (Chris Pine)

The Easter Bunny as a badass Aussie (Hugh Jackman)

The Tooth Fairy as a hummingbird-like creature (Ilsa Fisher)

It was amazingly creative, and the story was at once touching, adventurous, and funny. And, down at it's core, it had real HEART, with a clear and blatant MESSAGE, that as long as there is hope in the world, it can outweigh the fear and darkness in it. 10 out of 10, I gotta say...",1355529600,3,610,4.315789473684211
4813831,5,B005LAIIFS,"I have seen a lot of movies and this movie has the most amazing graphics and best 3D I have ever seen. I felt like I was in the same room as the scenes. The snowflakes come right at you and make you feel like it is really snowing on you. The man in the moon needs the help of The Guardians to defeat the evil pitch. The Guardians are amazing. The animators and writers do a stupendous job of creating believable characters. The Guardians consist of Santa, who is from Russia - He is jolly and lives in an amazing castle. He has the cutest elves with jingle bells on their heads. They are very funny and helpful. The Easter bunny - who is tough, from Australia and has a boomerang. His adorable eggs actually have legs and can run around. The Tooth Fairy is very different; she is a bird. She has pink wings and blue and green feathers. Her baby birds that help her are the sweetest little creatures. The Sandman is the one who makes all your dreams come true while you are sleeping.

The graphics for his amazing talents are fabulous. Jack Frost is one of my favorites. Everything he touches turn into frost. The animation of the frost covering everything is absolutely beautiful. Pitch wants the world to be dark and sad and to lose all hope. The children keep the world safe by having hope. Santa has a magic globe which is bright with lights as long as the children believe but once they stop believing their light goes out. The intricate design of the scenery is the best I have ever seen. Everything, from smallest detail to the large wondering dinosaurs, is breath taking.

This movie is humorous, adorable and magical. My favorite scenes are when the Easter Bunny goes on a sleigh ride with Santa Clause and when the baby eggs are running around. The Sandman's magic makes your heart glow. The message is to stop and find out what makes you special. You have to find out what it is that you do best and find your center so you know how to make yourself and others happy.

I loved this movie that mixes up holidays so you can watch it year round and get into the mood for the seasons. I recommend this for ages 6 and up. Pitch is frightening. The oversized Santa might be too much for the little ones because I am not joking he looks like you are right next to him. I give this movie 5 out 5 twinkling stars. Morgan B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

A magical movie with all your favorite childhood Guardians who come together to protect the children. Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Sandman and Jack Frost (Chris Pine) are chosen by the Man in the Moon to guard the children. They make sure that all children have wonderful dreams and faith. The more the children believe in the Guardians the more power they have. However, the Boogieman (Jude Law) rises to take over the sweet dreams and create nightmares and children begin to lose faith in the Guardians. Without faith or belief, the Guardians will disappear, the lights will turn off and the earth will be filled with darkness. This is when the Guardians join forces to fight the Boogieman. However, Jack Frost does not join forces to fight. He just wants to have fun and not worry about anything.

There are so many funny lines in this movie. My favorite part is when the Tooth Fairy looks at the collection of teeth; she knows which one flosses and exactly who it belongs to. I did not like the Boogieman because he seems so real and I don't want to see him when I sleep. The 3D special effects in this movie are so clear; they are unbelievable. When Jack Frost is flying it feels like you are flying with him and you can actually feel the cold air. The rivers of colors are so bright and clear. However, the music is so-so - not very exciting. The lesson in this movie is find your passion and you will know your purpose in life. The costumes are so awesome, especially the Fairies and Santa and his elves. The message in this movie is that joining forces can be more powerful than being by yourself. My favorite character is Jack Frost. He's very fun.

I rank this movie 4 out of 5 stars. I give this age range 3 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

This movie is awesome. It has a lot of action, a lot of funny parts, and I guess there could be some parts that can be seen as scary too. This movie is all about a guy named Jack Frost who came out of the ice but no one believes in him and so no one can see him. So he is turned into a guardian because the moon chooses him. Kind of strange, right? Well he was chosen to help save the world. He meets a lot of other guardians too but they aren't very nice at first so he isn't sure if he wants to be a guardian! Some of the main characters in the movie are Jack Frost, North, Tooth, Bunny, Pitch, and Jamie.

My favorite characters are Jack Frost and Jamie because Jack Frost doesn't want to be a guardian at first but then he fights Pitch and decides he would like to help the world which I like. Jaime is a good boy who believes in the guardians no matter what. He loves to have fun like me, so that proves he is a good character. I hope you like them as much as I do. My favorite part in the movie is when Jack Frost sees his memories because he learns that he had a sister and he saved her from falling in the ice. Sadly he didn't make it and fell into the ice. I felt so bad that he didn't make it but it was good that he saved his sister.

I would recommend this movie for ages 4 and up. Pitch can be a little scary at times but I love the movie and there isn't too much to be scared about. Go out and see this movie in theaters on November 21. Anthony A, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",1355443200,2,5657,4.220887245841035
4813832,5,B005LAIIFS,"""Rise Of The Guardians"" is a fantastic film based on the ""Guardians Of Childhood"" book series by Bill Joyce and it features top-notch animation, storytelling and voice acting. It has plenty of heart and a few mildly funny moments and quite a few tear-jerking moments as well. (You probably want to bring a box of tissues with you to the theater, just in case.) This movie is quite a departure for DreamWorks Animation due to the fact that there are no pop-culture references or crass potty humor whatsoever. This is a truly wonderful timeless film that will be enjoyed for many generations. Hopefully DreamWorks will make a sequel and a T.V. series like they've done with some of thier other franchises because these characters deserve to have more stories told about them on screen!",1355356800,4,783,4.850746268656716
4813833,4,B005LAIIFS,"""Rise of the Guardians"" is a fascinating reimagining of some familiar childhood fairy tale favorites as superhero guardians of the wonders of childhood.  It features Jack Frost, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, Santa, and the Sandman in stunning animation, along with the Bogeyman.  There is lots of comedy, lots of action, and some dark moments that may be disturbing for really small children.

As the story begins, Jack Frost is born, rising out of a frozen pond and given his name by the Man in the Moon.  Jack discovers at least some of his powers, and his ability to have fun, but his real purpose only begins to become clear when he is summoned to the North Pole.  There, he will be invited to join his fellow childhood characters as a Guardian.  The ocasion is the return of the Bogeyman, a nasty character who wants to replace childhood dreams with nightmares.  The struggle of the Guardians with the Bogeyman is the core of the movie.  Jack will have to discover the secret of his own origins, just in time to save the day.

""Rise of the Guardians"" has some name talent behind the excellent animation, and an imaginative storyline that audiences of all ages will enjoy.  Highly recommended.",1355011200,,1202,4.708133971291866
