7820896,5,630206242X,What a sad time in our world's history. The execution of the Romanov family including the children is a testament to what Communist radicals will do to have power and to extract vengeance. A fascinating documentary that is well worth showing to high school and college history classes. This is a warning to people who wonder what Communists are capable of. They are capable of heinous crimes against humanity especially children. Nothing has changed with America's love and tolerance for mass genocide of the innocent young in a woman's womb. Sad isn't it?,1398470400,,556,4.989247311827957
7820897,4,630206242X,I am a huge Romanov fan and never get enough of the Romanov tale and the nights at Tsarskoe Selo with Lavish balls. This shows how the Russian Revolution erased the Tsars forever. From the Family life to the First World War and the brutal assassination of the last ruling family of Imperial Russia.,996969600,18,298,4.537037037037037
