323250,5,6301302990,"When ambitious waitress Carole Landis reaches for Hollywood fame, she is found murdered in the apartment she shares with sister Betty Grable. Suspicion falls on Victor Mature's, Carole's promoter, but Betty believes  in him and helps, through devious ploys, to unmask the real killer. Plenty  of twists to keep you guessing in this exellent film noir, based on the  book by Steve Fisher. Grable had one number to sing in this but, in order  to  sustain the dramatic content of the film, it was cut and Grable's  occupation changed from songplugger to stenographer.
When previewed,  this film (then entitled Hot Spot) was given the thumbs down by the  audience - they thought they were in for a Grable musical treat. Zanuck and  director Bruce Humberstone, re-edited the film and added new key scenes,  working day and night to have it ready for its premiere. Reverted to its  original title, it soon became a success and is a highly rated movie in its  genre.
Laird Cregar steals the acting honours as the sinister detective  investigating Landis's murder. And that excellent supporting actor, Elisha  Cook Jr., is one of the ""red herrings"" under audience  suspicion.
Cameraman Edward Cronjager does much to add to the atmosphere  of this classic mystery with some fine low-key lighting and imaginative  photography.",935280000,27,1316,5.046511627906977

However, the story was pretty good, the acting likewise, especially by Laird Cregar as a hulking and lurking policeman.  Carole Landis died mysteriously (ruled a suicide) seven years later and only had a small part near the beginning, but she was quite the looker.  Too bad her career was so brief.  The soundtrack was a bit disappointing.  Over the Rainbow had just appeared two years earlier in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and it seems strange that they would use it in this movie too, especially so soon after the former movie.  I could even go as high as 4 stars... maybe (to be decided after another viewing some years down the road).

PRECISION: this is a Region 1 NTSC DVD. It will NOT play on Region 2 PAL European equipment.

Two young beautiful sisters soldier on through life in New York in early 40s: Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) is a waitress and her sister Jill (Betty Grable) is a typist. One day a kind of slightly shady smooth operator named Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), who is a promoter by profession, notices Vicky and bets with two of his friends, that he can quickly make her into a renowned model or maybe even more... Vicky trusts Christopher, but Jill is very suspicious about him and doesn't hide it... Then tragedy occurs and when the police shows the film really begins... I will not say anything more about the story.

This film impressed me for many reasons. The scenario is strong. The mystery is well preserved but once we know the truth, the whole thing makes perfect sense. Dialogs are brilliant, witty and even if it is a dark movie, frequently funny. The ""film noir"" unique atmosphere is as dense as clouds on Venus. Characters are well designed, each having his own story to tell. And the story is simply great!

This is a rather short film (82 minutes) but every single second was well used, without even a single one being wasted. Because of that the director was able to ""pack"" the things so well and so tightly, that you would never think that only 82 minutes passed! It is an impressive management of time!

This film is also a very succesful mixture of many genres: ""film noir"" of course but also some romantic comedy and a more classical whodunit - and somehow it all works together perfectly!

Actors did VERY well. Betty Grable doesn't sing or danse here as in most of her movies - but this being her, the director simply HAD TO arrange two scenes, in which she shows her legs...))) Victor Mature is equally excellent in a role very different from his later Biblical dramas... As for Carole Landis, she simply SHINES! But possibly the best performance is that of Laird Cregar, who plays a very menacing and very HUGE police detective, named Ed Cornell, a remarkably complex and interesting character.

Another thing which I appreciated a lot is the use of ""Over the rainbow"" theme from ""Wizard of Oz"". I would never believe that you can use such a sweet song as the main theme for a very dark ""film noir"", but here it was used wonderfully! Kudos for the idea!

I LOVED this film and it impressed me. I will absolutely keep the DVD for another viewing! ENJOY!",1452902400,,2732,4.606995884773663

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

'I Wake Up Screaming' came out around the time 'The Maltese Falcon', which is considered the first true film noir. 'Screaming' has some noirish elements including some dark lighting, a femme fatale of sorts and a man falsely accused of murder but it can't make up its mind whether its appeal is slanted toward the lover of a good mystery or romance. Indeed, the occasionally insufferable soundtrack features one too many tidbits of 'Over the Rainbow', occasionally ruining the dark atmosphere of menace that a true film noir should engender.

'I Wake Up Screaming' disappoints on many levels. First there's the murder victim herself, Vicky Lynn (played by Carole Landis, who tragically took her own life approximately seven years after this film's first release). Vicky is a waitress turned would-be actress, after being discovered by sports promoter, Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature). One wonders why these high society types (who are friends of Christopher), fall head over heels for the unconnected Vicky, who has nothing to offer except maybe her looks. The way they fawn over this unproven neophyte is truly embarrassing. Not all actresses at that time got ahead simply because of their looks--there was something also called 'personality' but unfortunately the films' scenarists here chose to present the requisite go-getter as a generic bimbo.

Maybe this is the reason why Vicky's sister, Jill (Betty Grable), along with Christopher, fail to emote when they learn of Vicky's murder. Yes, this bothered me but then again, when you intentionally create such generic characters, it stands to follow that real emotions will invariably not end up on display. I also found Victor Mature to be hopelessly miscast as Christopher, who should be a more hardened, streetwise character. Mature is simply too much of a 'nice guy' to play a tough guy sports promoter. Betty Grable is more fitting as the goody two shoes sister but too much time is taken up with Grable and Mature canoodling, and taking us away from the aforementioned atmosphere of dread (it should be noted that the DVD extras feature a song that Grable sings that was cut from the final print; that only goes to show the mindset of the films' producers before they decided to turn 'I Wake Up Screaming' into something a tad bit more grittier).

The 'Screaming' plot is really nothing to write home about. Yes there's a nice little twist when Jill recognizes creepy Detective Ed Cornell (menacingly and finely played by Laird Cregar who also met a sad demise at an early age), as the guy who had stalked Vicky earlier, while she was working as a waitress. Cornell is the bad cop who breaks into Christopher's apartment, misappropriates evidence without a warrant and ultimately still attempts to arrest Christopher, even though he has already obtained a confession from the real killer. We get the idea early on that Cornell is both a bad guy and pushy to boot but things really fall apart at the climax when it's revealed he's a pathetic sad sack stalker, who has pictures of Vicky plastered all over his apartment. Instead of killing Christopher (which of course would not have worked well for a 1941 audience but would have been a better ending today--I'm thinking of John Houston in 'Chinatown', the real bad guy pedophile who gets away with it), Cornell, sheepishly and pathetically, takes his own life.

The real killer turns out to be a big let down: Harry Williams, the bellhop, whose obsession with Vicky was even worse than Cornell's (Elisha Cook Jr. provides the proper histrionics, as the noted 'B' actor was always good at playing neurotics and petty criminals).

Oh yes, there are two other characters, an over the hill actor and cynical Broadway columnist, who are the 'red herrings' designed to distract you from figuring out who the real killer is. Again, when we do find out that Harry Williams did Vicky in, he just seems so tangential to the main story, as if it were an aside in a play (also, please clue me in how the police can call Harry a ""suspect"", simply because he went missing for a day or two--later they discover the was visiting relatives in Brooklyn, and have to let him go).

The 'I Wake Up Screaming' denouement is wholly appropriate, as we find the two lovebirds, Jill and Christopher, once again canoodling in the 'ritzy' night club which both sisters found so exciting. The lightweight ending might be good for the family friendly aficionados who dig the happy endings and the silly romance, but film noir has clearly taken a back seat, in this puppy love, pseudo-thriller.",1415750400,2,4642,4.896946564885496

323380,3,6301302990,"Inexplicably, Betty Grable is cast as the sister of Carole Landis, yet it is Carole Landis who portrays a waitress discovered by publicist Victor Mature in a coffee shop on 8th Avenue, then wined and dined and promoted to stardom.  Grable and Landis should have switched roles, and it would have been far more believable.  Grable comes across as far more beautiful and desirable.  At any rate, Landis is mysteriously murdered on the eve of her departure for Hollywood, and the rest of the movie is given over to Laird Cregar as a cop determined to frame Victor Mature for the murder.  As it turns out, Laird Cregar has an adoration complex for Landis, and is jealous of Mature's role in her life. The true killer is probably the most unlikely suspect of all, and doesn't enter the equation until the very end of the film.  Cregar's motivation for trying to frame Mature comes across as unconvincing at best. The movie lacks suspense, the dialogue is overwritten, the plot clunks along, and the action is marred by incessant treacly strains of Harold Arlen's ""Over the Rainbow"" (I hope he got plenty of royalties), and some faux-Gershwin.  All of this is an attempt to make the film seem sexy, but very little of it rings true.  The casting of Landis in the central female role was a great mistake.",1402963200,2,1297,4.662280701754386

In any case, I'm willing to grant that I Wake Up Screaming ought to be granted membership as an early example of the genre -- I just happen to think it's a film that truly squanders its potential, no matter what category you put it in. One aspect where it can hold its head up high, however, is with respect to lighting and photography. Mysterious interiors and interrogators in shadow have rarely been displayed as skillfully or with as much atmosphere as in this movie. And the plot structure is both typical and engaging: At the outset we know a woman has been murdered, and that the protagonist is a major suspect. Various characters involved relate past events through brief flashbacks, and then we're in the present more or less for good. Quietly presiding over it all is a dedicated Javert of a police detective who nonetheless is menacing and suspicious himself from the start. So far so good, but then all  this potential steam begins to leak out badly. Though some suspicion is cast on some of the supporting characters, it's never made convincing enough, and early on we know where the answers lie. And though the precise answer is not quite as expected, it doesn't come as any great surprise. On top of that, much of the story line is highly improbable: Private rooms are entered with ease, and people show up right on cue in unlikely places for no plausible reason. Moreover, the dialogue is rather amateurish at times. Finally, leads Victor Mature and Betty Grable don't have sufficient depth to pull this film out of the hole that is its screenplay. Indeed, the film is essentially stolen by tragic supporting stars Laird Cregar and Carole Landis. As I said at the start, this film has great moody lighting and photography, particularly considering its 1941 release date, and that plus Cregar and Landis make it more than just bearable -- but not by much.",1358899200,,1996,4.752161383285302
323443,5,6301302990,"A very early version of a crime thriller that would ""morph"" over the ensuing 10 years  into what is now commonly termed as ""noir"" type films. The story is fairly simple: a brash NYC promoter (played by  Victure Mature) discovers an attractive young woman (Carole Landis) working in a diner. He bets his two urban sopisticate friends that he can make her a celebrity by getting her the right media exposure ( at the time it meant getting your picture and name in the newspaper society/gossip section). The woman, played by Carole Landis, is at first skeptical, but goes along with the plan and soon finds herself gaining cafe-society attention and endorsement work. Victor Mature's character and his two wager companions all have a ""romantic"" inetrest in the woman, so when she ends up murdered in the apartment she shares with her sister(Betty Grable), each of the three suitors come under suspicion as a possible culprit. The movie follows the attempts of a creepy police detective(Laird Cregar) as he relentlessly pursues and tries to prove the Victor Mature character as the murderer. While there are some ""dark"" tense moments, there are enough light touches and humor to keep an upbeat tone and lead the film to a happy ending.

What makes the film especially interesting is the early use of stylized lighting and film angle techniques that would come to represent standard features of the ""noir"" films (plus some fairly complex flashback narration). Also notable is the casting of Betty Grable as one of the leads. Ms Grable came to Hollywood in 1929 at the age of thirteen, and started working in film musicals as a chorus girl( yes, you can see her at this early age in films like ""Whoopee"" from 1930). She moved on to Co-ed movies in the 1930's with modest success at a few different studios, but was out of work by 1939 when Twentieth-Century Fox gave her a contract with the intention of putting her into Ginger Rogers-type musicals. After a leading-role hit in the 1940 musical-comedy ""Down Argentine Way"", the studio cast her in this film to take advantage of her rising popularity. Although ""I Wake Up Screaming""  was a financial success, Ms. Grable would effectively refuse dramatic-type roles for the rest of her career at Twentieth-Century-Fox (She would eventually have a falling out with the studio in 1953 over these refusals). After this film, she would sing and dance her way through a string of musical comedies that would make her the top female box-office draw from 1942 -1951( belying the tag of ""pin-up girl"" that is applied to her nowadays).The pert, bubbly personality and girl next-door looks that made her perfect for musical/comedies is readily apparent from watching this movie.

Fun film, with some added historical interest. A nice commentary in the bonus features",1356825600,8,2798,4.919491525423729

323447,4,6301302990,"Betty Grable is not known,nor does she have a reputation of making, good films and there are probably a few reasons for this. She was a pin up figure,known for her figure and looks,and perhaps her acting style. However in my youth more than marilyn monroe i saw her films,and i enjoyed them. There's a wholesomeness
and she's never overtly seductive,as a matter of fact she purposely holds herself back and even her dress in this film is semi business professional,and
its always an image she liked to put forward. It was only after the pin up sensation,and this whole matter is something she did not want to enter or
publicize on her own,but she is best viewed as a great entertainer,and 20th century fox had both her and marilyn monroe,so these must be stars they liked
to groom with that image. Victor Mature,who was famous for on occasion playing these little Italy characters,even when he's tough he has a niceness to him,
and the film starts with him. The trailer of the film is interesting with the line,'nothing like that has ever entered my head its much deeper than that.',a thought always hinted at in this film. The mature character is frankie botticelli,like a character in Hitchcock's Wrong Man,wrongfully slandered and
accused and treated thug like. Really electric chair. He likes to put girls on
magazines,play them up for the fantasies of people,model like,but not the girls he likes from his old neighbourhood and their families whom he loves. His character is the only character with any ethics and profound mental altruism in this film and a facet of these characters who are a part of these locales. Of course his love is the Grable type character who loves him,and their nemesis is the police investigator. For some reason there are a few leads for different characters,and they 'fix' on him. A fix is a code word for entrapment,which many people think has ruined modern police forces as more resources are pumped here,ruining neighbourhoods,and not putting money into investigations. This character is railroaded relentlessly but at the end a happly gloss is put on matters,and he carts off with the Grable character and they are married. After he's innocent that's why filmmakers can do this at hollywood at this time...the police investigator is a man who has visions before suspect is guilty of anything of seeing him in electric chair,murdered,and this type of fantassy is
quite dangerous in investigators for we never know role they play in these communities,if they have these destructive impulses. Also near end of film officer is seen with all types of sexual fantasies,and the garable character opens the door midway for him suspicious of his leering ways. Investigators must have very clear minds but with multiple fixations,fantasies and impulses
we don't know what kind of investigative work will come here,early film noir
of community life in america and the people who rose up in police forces,of course any entrapment process which carrles on for long term becomes entrapment in which the police or whomever,get all kinds of social services and local
government,complicit,making a mess of cities. Many other films will carry this theme..which is why many in the fbi and senior police forces and criminologists wonder at the logic of this. Especially if it becomes chronic,and the individuals they go after. They say it causes more harm then good,and there's a reason they have this view. What they do say is very often these investigators,not always there are many reasons,and in this film the word fixated is used,develop fantasies toward female characters which drive them. Senior police will tell you that's the crux of the problem,and all kinds of psychoanalytic interpretations can be made of characters...as entertainment it succeeds and is one of betty's best film,and her films always left me feeling good which is why she was always a permanent fixture in american films,trying to preserve her wholesome image,even as a chanteuse. Deleted film is interesting with gawking boss..elisha cook jr also appears and he just finished Maltese Falcon a movvie with similar themes..same theme would be replayed with Bogart's Knock on any Door(1949)about nick romano similar community member victim of society which i will talk of next. A film he independently funded and produced and distributed,which critics thought an odd choice...but more later",1332806400,,4386,5.084604715672677
323448,4,6301302990,"I have at this point reviewed a fair number of the crime noir films from the 1940s and 1950s. Some are classics like Out Of The Past, some are filled with simple crime doesn't pay messages, some have femmes fatales that you would gladly commit armed robbery unarmed for just to get a whiff of their perfume. Others you would still be removing the bullets from your body, their bullets. Most, frankly, are just kind of run-of-the-mill like the film under review here, I Wake Up Screaming. Nothing exceptional here but the fact that the film has two, count `em two, femme fatales, well kind of, kind of femme fatales. And neither is bad, just misunderstood, but hell you would still give something to catch a whiff of that perfume mentioned above. Although maybe you would think twice about robbing banks unarmed for either.

Here's the skinny. One wanna-be femme fatale starts out like many another country girl hitting the big city serving them off the arm in some hash house. Ms. Waitress (oops, waitperson, played by Carol Landis) is just waiting around to be ""discovered"" and plucked away from the eggs over easy. As luck would have it three, although only one counts, Frankie Christopher (played by ruggedly handsome, up-front-the dregs Victor Mature), men-about-town camp on her station and Frankie, a promoter of, well, let's leave it as promoter, decides to take Ms. Waitperson from rags to riches, on the quick. He can see a meal ticket a mile away. And his preparations for the big strike work, work well, for a while.

What fouls things up is that one fine afternoon Ms. Waitperson is found by Frankie dead, very dead, in her apartment. And who fit the bill for the frame by his various actions toward the deceased is none other than Frankie. In a series of flash-backs the motives, actions, and responses of most of those involved are uncovered. And that is where Sis, <em>femme fatale</em> number two comes in; Ms. Waitperson's sis (played by World War II soldier boys calendar heartthrob Betty Grable) who is her roommate, her confidante and her scolding younger sister is also in love with our boy Frankie (go figure, right) but is confused by the evidence against him. And Frankie is smitten by Sis as well so no fear things will get worked out. Hovering over the whole scene though are the bizarre actions of a relentless big- city cop trying to send Frankie to the chair for his own motives. Uncovering the cop's motives is what drives the second half of the film. And that is all you need to know about this one.

323485,4,6301302990,"An up-and-coming glamor girl/starlet, Vicki Lynn (Carole Landis), has been murdered. The sports promoter Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature) who had been pushing her into the spotlight is suspected of the killing, and as the film opens, he's being questioned under the bright spotlights of pre-Miranda law police interrogation. There's a soft, velvety but sinister voice belonging to a big guy, hidden behind the light. He's the head investigator. He's trouble for Frankie, who of course didn't do it - or so he claims. The camera tracks through the police department to another room, where Vicki's sister Jill (Betty Grable) is also being questioned. Between them, over 82 minutes, they fill in the story of Vicki's rise and untimely death in flashback form, even as they struggle in the presence to clear Frankie's name - meanwhile falling in love.

The sinister velvet voice turns out to belong to Inspector Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar), a top cop who's never failed to solve a case, but who seems to take a delight in this one - and in particular, in hounding Frankie - out of proportion to his job. Cornell seems to show up everywhere in the present, and it turns out, in the past as well - he was paying attention to the sisters well before Vicki's death, for some reason that remains a mystery throughout the film. And then there are Frankie's friends, Robin (Allan Mowbray) and Larry (Allyn Joslyn) with whom he made a sort of Pygmalion-type bet when he decided to transform young uncultured waitress Vicki into a society girl - perhaps one of them knows something about the untimely demise of the starlet-to-be. And the clerk at Vicki and Jill's apartment building (Elisha Cook Jr) also seems to have a story - but will he reveal it, and will it be enough to save Frankie - if Frankie is innocent?

I'm making this very early noir effort out to be perhaps a little more suspenseful than it really is. Truth to tell, it's actually full of comedy, a ""light"" affair that was probably toned down quite a bit from Steve Fisher's novel so as to make it palatable for the audience of Betty Grable fans. Though I wouldn't quite call it a ""comedy"" noir like HIS KIND OF WOMAN, it definitely doesn't have the tension that we usually associate with prime examples of the style. Often we'll get a tense sequence but it will be immediately followed by a moment of light humor - even slapstick - which brings us out of the shadows and dread. Still, as the always-excellent commentary by Eddie Muller makes clear, this was a very early noir - shot at exactly the same time as THE MALTESE FALCON which is of course far more heralded and influential; the building blocks are all there in the terrific lighting by Edward Cronjager, the snappy dialogue by Dwight Taylor, and Humberstone's gorgeous framing and gliding camerawork. Most of all, it's the cast that makes this work; Grable and Landis are both fine, both showing aspects beyond the pretty faces that they're seen as by the men in the film, but it's Mature and especially Cregar who really lift this into near-classic status. Mature has to be one of the most underrated actors of all time; like Robert Mitchum he was very self-deprecating and had a habit of looking like he wasn't acting - unlike Mitchum he really was rather insecure, and sometimes didn't give his all when he felt like he was just there to be ""Victor Mature, shirtless guy"". In his noir work though - this film and especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-of-Death/dp/B000B83846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss of Death</a>&nbsp;- he really does show some depth, an easy-going manner when it's called for but also some real pathos and animation.

Ultimately, though, good as he is in this film, he's upstaged by Cregar, who at 6'3"" and about 300 pounds will probably remind most noir aficionados most of Orson Welles in TOUCH OF EVIL, or perhaps Raymond Burr.  Cregar only lived a few more years after this film, dying from a heart attack after a too-quick crash diet for his last film, Hangover Square in 1944.  He's got an incredible presence in this film, physically huge but emotionally tiny and wimpering, soft-voiced but menacing in intent. Like Mature he acts as much with his face, with his eyes and his forehead, as he does with his voice and his physique, but that hulking form combined with Cronjager's lighting assures that he dominates every scene, a Golem or Frankenstein figure always lurking about, waiting to crush the hopes of the protaganists for his own diabolical reasons.

It's not one of my very favorites of the style, but certainly it's important and worth seeing as an early example, and Cregar's performance is just stunning.  As I mentioned above, this one has Eddie Muller commentary, and Muller is the absolute top guy for this stuff, both thoroughly engaging and knowledgeable, and funny and conversational.  Right off the bat he's talking about how lucky the young actor who plays a newsboy in an early scene was to sleep with (and marry) Gloria Grahame a few years later, and his commentary on how the repetition of two musical themes - ""Over the Rainbow"" and ""Street Scene"" work in the film was quite revealing.  He also talks a fair bit about Steve Fisher, author of the novel and a man with almost a hundred film and TV credits as a writer or screenwriter, as successful in his day as Chandler or Hammett, but almost completely forgotten now.  I'm tempted to give this release an extra star just for Muller - but heck, I can't rate ALL the Fox Film Noir stuff 5 stars.  In any case, a must for noir aficionados.",1287619200,8,5614,4.813278008298755
323486,4,6301302990,".....I am a film noir fan and this movie had a lot of interesting facets to it that made it attractive to me.

.....First it was Betty Grable's first non musical role although they did manage to sneak in a swimming scene which gave Betty a chance to showcase her legs. As a straight dramatic actress Gable held up her end as Mature's love interest.

.....I liked Victor Mature in ""Kiss of Death"" and thought he was a perfect type for film noir.  He had rugged good looks and looked great in a fedora which went along with his gruff manner.  I don't understand why Hollywood didn't use him more often in this genre.  I thought he was miscast in many of his rolls, especially his role as the dying consumptive Doc Holliday in a rare John Ford bomb ""My Darling Clementine"".  I think Mature would have been a more popular actor if he had been used properly.

.....The movie also had two players who met untimely deaths early in their careers, Carole Landis and Laird Cregar. Cregar almost stole the film as a creepy detective determined to pin a murder on Mature even though he knew Mature was innocent.

323489,4,6301302990,"Judging from the title alone, a casual buff of vintage films might pass this one by as just a cheapie, a screamer, another pulp movie to display Betty Grable's legs and Victor Mature's chest.

Not so.  This is one of the earliest of the film noir genre, and, as historian Eddie Muller tells us in his engaging commentary, probably THE first noir made by 20th Century-Fox -- and the release date of 1941 offers proof of this, contemporary with ""Citizen Kane"", which might also be characterized as a quintessential film noir.

It's a beauty:  dark, tense, full of plot twists, showing off all those photographic tricks characteristic of noirs:  steep camera angles, blatant light/shadow contrasts, shooting through window blinds or doorway gratings, even capturing the pattern of Ms. Grable's wide-open eyelashes against her cheeks (as Eddie Muller observes).

The latter-day viewer may laugh at the cliches -- a suspect, say, sitting on a low chair railing at his interrogators above his head shining lights into his eyes -- but they are nonetheless part of the genre and may not have been so trite at the time.  (Tommy Udo's nasal laugh in ""Kiss of Death"" was endlessly satirized because is was so effective when the film was new.)

The directing is agile, the action is unpredictable and full of bits of business, the acting is just great.  Betty Grable and Victor Mature turn out marvelous performances that will surprise those who assume these two had nothing more going for them than beautiful bodies.  (An irrelevant swimming-pool scene demonstrates that the studio was thinking the same way.)  Victor Mature has one of the most expressive faces of any actor I've ever seen (shown to even better effect in ""Kiss of Death""), and DVD commentator Eddie Muller says that he acted with his scalp -- his hat moved back and forth when he raised and lowered his eyebrows.

The dialogue's pretty snappy, too, often pushing the limits of the Production Code, and helps break the suspense.  Dwight Taylor, son of Broadway actress Laurette Taylor (the original stage Amanda Wingfield of ""Glass Menagerie"") was no slouch as a screenwriter.

Carole Landis is shining here, as she should be, but tinged perhaps with the viewer's knowledge of her sad end a few years later.

But Laird Cregar is the guy who stalks off with the movie in his big pockets.  People should get to know this fine actor, if they don't already.  He LOOMS.  One customer reviewer calls him a composite of Sydney Greenstreet and Vincent Price.  You get the idea.

Terrific dialogue and a cast of likely suspects from Alan Mowbray to Elisha Cook Jr. actually gives this one a convincing whodunit element - you actually do start wondering if Mature could be guilty towards the end.

323522,4,6301302990,"As it originally emerged, Film Noir was as glossy as it was tough, a genre photographed in a remarkable visual style of light and shadow and offering cynical and often witty tales of slick anti-heroes and dangerous dames--and films like THE MALTESE FALCON, THIS GUN FOR HIRE, MILDRED PIERCE, THE BLUE DAHLIA, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY remain great classics of their kind.  At the same time, however, 20th Century Fox was releasing a stream of ""pulp"" crime dramas.  Often overlooked or flatly dismissed by critics, they would pave the way for the shift in Noir style that came in 1948 with the ""true crime,"" gritty style of NAKED CITY.

The first of these 20th Century Fox films, based on a novel by Steve Fisher, was I WAKE UP SCREAMING.  Jill and Vicky Lynn (Betty Grable and Carole Landis) are two sisters living in New York; Vicky is working as a waitress when she is noticed by promoter Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), who is soon convinced he can turn her into a star.  But Vicky proves perfidious: once success is within her grasp she drops Frankie to pursue a career in Hollywood.  Her career never comes to pass: she is found dead in her apartment, Frankie standing over her.  And police inspector Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) makes it clear that he intends to nail Frankie for Vicky's murder.

Although the dialogue is clunky, the film structure is intriguing, often telling the story through flashbacks in a way upon the 1944 LAURA would improve.  But the real power of the film is the sharp edge with which director H. Bruce Humberstone endows the film--and the truly memorable photography by Edward Cronjager, a truly gifted cinematographer who would receive no fewer than seven Oscar nominations during his long career.  And then there are two powerhouse performances that drive the film: Carole Landis and Laird Cregar.

Originally from Wisconsin, Carole Landis began her career playing bit parts in such films as A DAY AT THE RACES--but in 1940 she had a major breakthrough in the film ONE MILLION YEARS B.C.  In hindsight, it is obvious that Landis was a competent if slightly limited actress; at the time, however, she was generally dismissed by critics as just another pretty girl without significant talents.  In a very real sense, I WAKE UP SCREAMING would be the high-water mark of her career; she was thereafter generally overlooked by the studio and often miscast.  By 1948 her career was over, and she took her own life.

Laird Cregar, however, was a different matter, immediately recognized for his gifts.  But Cregar was an extremely large man, weighing in at 300 pounds.  It was a fact that limited his career, and although he appeared to tremendous effect in such films as THIS GUN FOR HIRE, HEAVEN CAN WAIT, and the exceptional THE LODGER, leading man status eluded him. Determined to cross the line, Cregar went on a crash diet and dropped over 100 pounds.  It got him the lead in HANGOVER SQUARE, which many regard as his best film--but it also strained his health to the breaking point, and he died of heart failure in 1945.

In spite of its innovations, the firey performances of Landis and Cregar, and an unexpected plot twist that can still drop jaws today, I WAKE UP SCREAMING is a slightly awkward film, largely due to the flippant nature of its dialogue and the ""goody goody"" quality of the role assigned to Betty Grable, who reads here as somewhat saccharine.  Nonetheless, this is a film that fans of Film Noir cannot afford to miss, for it points the way to the new style.  The quality of the picture is a bit hit and miss, but the DVD has a surprising number of bonuses--including a memorable audio commentary by film historian Eddie Muller.  In comparison to such contemporary films as THE MALTESE FALCON and the slightly later LAURA, it is pretty mild stuff--but the film has a historical importance in terms of the Noir movement, and fans of the genre will find it indispensible.  Recommended.

323527,4,6301302990,"No one smokes in it and there is very little rain on the night streets, but a 1941 Fox release called I WAKE UP SCREAMING is definitely a film noir--and a very good one.  Working with a Dwight Taylor screenplay, director Bruce Humberstone (who directed four Charlie Chan films at Fox) has a terrific noir cast--atypically cast Betty Grable is Jill Lynn.  Her fashion model sister, Vicki (Carole Landis), is found murdered.  Leading the suspects is sports promoter Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), along with oily detective Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) and hotel desk clerk Elisha Cook. Jr.  There is also a gossip columnist (Alan Mowbray).  Maybe Jill herself is the killer in an act of jealousy.  Possibly Jill and Frankie did the crime together.

I WAKE UP SCREAMING has wonderfully atmospheric New York City locales.  The movie has beautiful B&W photography by Edward Cronjager, who worked in Technicolor with Ernst Lubitsch a couple of years later on HEAVEN CAN WAIT (1943).  And it has very suspenseful plotting, with the classic noir flashback device.  Vicki's body is discovered in the opening scenes.  For most of the movie, Frankie and Jill are being interrogated in two police offices under harsh lights, while also being given ""the third degree"" by the pesty Cornell all over Manhattan.  The ending is a real surprise, or was to me.

I WAKE UP SCREAMING also makes beautiful use of ""Over the Rainbow"" (borrowed from MGM?) and the classic Fox ""Street Scene"" theme.  This is an 82 minute ""B"" movie and no classic, but is still a gripping and rewarding entry in the Fox Film Noir DVD series with an outstanding cast and crew.  It is certainly worth your time, if you like film noir.  The underrated Grable does excellently in a non-musical role.  Humberstone had just completed SUN VALLEY SERENADE with her.  DVD bonuses include an audio commentary by noir expert Eddie Muller, a deleted scene, and alternate HOT SPOT opening titles.  This movie is currently selling for only $10 brand-new from Amazon, so it is probably a better sales item than a rental.",1158883200,6,2064,4.8962536023054755
323528,5,6301302990,"From the title, it would appear that I WAKE UP SCREAMING is a 1941 thriller with blood curdling scenes to keep you awake at night. Actually, this is a noir mystery -- a whodunit. The title overstates the action which is still quite good -- just not frightening.

Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature) is under the hot lights as prime suspect in a murder investigation of waitress Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis). With flashbacks reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BAREFOOT-CONTESSA/dp/B00005AUK7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BAREFOOT CONTESSA</a>&nbsp;(1954), each man in the life of the victim recalls his encounter with Vicky.

Jill (Betty Grable) takes center stage as she discovers Frankie standing over her sister's body. Wanting to  believe his innocence, the two work together to find out what really happened while Police Inspector Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) is relentlessly on the heels of Frankie. In the end, all the pieces neatly fall in place.

Mature has a difficult role. The way he is hounded, it would seem he would wake up screaming every night. Instead, he remains level-headed but belligerent. Landis only appears as a memory so beautiful Grable (who at one time was the highest paid Hollywood actress with legs insured for one million dollars) is the real star.

If you like mystery and suspense you can rest easy after I WAKE UP SCREAMING. (4.5 stars)

323529,4,6301302990,"""I Wake Up Screaming"" was the first film noir made at 20th Century Fox. Its greatest distinction is its visual style whose low-key lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after World War II. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager created a striking early example of ""noir"" lighting -what John Alton appropriately called ""mystery lighting""- in this film made in 1941, before the United States entered the War. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Fisher, adapted for the screen by Dwight Taylor, who moved the action to New York, gave it a flashback structure, and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in pre-War Hollywood that combines multiple genres: Mystery, romance, musical (the singing scene was cut), comedy, suspense, and psychological drama. But the suspense does dominate.

When model and aspiring actress Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) is murdered, the police are quick to blame Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), a fight promoter who met Vicky when she was a waitress, introduced her to all the right people, and managed her ascent to glamour girl -until she left him for Hollywood. Vicky's down-to-earth sister Jill (Betty Grable) disapproved of her career choice but doesn't want to believe Frankie responsible for her death. The Assistant District Attorney thinks early on that the creepy switchboard operator (Elisha Cook, Jr.) at the Lynns' apartment building is the killer, but sadistic police detective Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) won't let up on Frankie, constantly harassing and threatening him, leaving Frankie little choice but to find the killer himself.

""I Wake Up Screaming"" opens with an eyecatching credit sequence of names in lights sprawled across a dark cityscape. That got my attention. Then we move on to an interrogation room at the police station. Frankie Christopher is harshly lit with one lamp, surrounded by police officers in the shadows. Gorgeous, dramatic, low-key lighting. The faces of some characters, even Frankie, are sometimes completely blacked out. I don't know if that is due to a film with limited tonal range or if it's deliberate. But it's daring. Everywhere we go in the station house, there are bars and shadows. The implication that the characters are trapped as if in a cage is overwhelming. The police station is like a template for film noir aesthetic. This really surprised me in such an early film, but it's fabulous.

This was Betty Grable's first non-musical role. She's all sweetness and goodness, but she is also level-headed, practical, and brave in the mold of a film noir helper-heroine. Unfortunately, every time she appears on screen we hear ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", which eventually drove me a little nuts. Victor Mature makes a strong and appealing protagonist. But the stand-out performance comes from Laird Cregar as the very creepy, obsessed police detective Cornell. He's truly unsettling and one of the most memorable noir villains. The dialogue isn't hard-boiled except for a few lines delivered by Vicky. But ""I Wake Up Screaming"" is a superb example of the film noir style as it was entering Hollywood's visual vocabulary.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006):  A few scenes show some white specks and lines, but this print is generally good. Sound is good. Bonus features: A deleted scene called ""Daddy"" (4 min), in which Betty Grable sings. This doesn't fit the tone of the movie well, so it was best left out. ""Hot Spot"" (text) is a brief account of the film's title change from ""I Wake Up Screaming"" to ""Hot Spot"" and back again. We can watch the opening credits for the film with the ""Hot Spot"" title (1 min). There are 3 ""Still Galleries"": A Poster Gallery (3 posters), a Production Stills Gallery of behind-the-scenes photos (8), and a Unit Photography Gallery of publicity stills (38 photos). It's interesting to note that scenes are much more brightly lit in the publicity stills than in the movie itself. There is a theatrical trailer (2 min). Film noir historian Eddie Muller delivers a good, nearly constant audio commentary. He compares the screenplay to Steven Fisher's novel, provides background information for many of the creative crew and actors, discusses the noir visual style and the juxtaposition of light and dark thematic elements in the film. Muller speaks a lot about the people involved in the film, as always. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.",1151625600,142,4426,5.057534246575343

It's distinguished by great writing and excellent acting.  The performance that stands out in my mind is the one delivered by Laird Cregar, a detective who dogs Victor Mature's talent promoter for the murder of a model that he groomed for success.  It's the kind of turn that stands out among the great supporting roles of film noir.

323565,5,6301302990,"""I Wake Up Screaming"" is more of a whodunit than a classic film noir. It's true there are some nice classic noir touches in IWUS, but there are also ""non-noir"" brightly-lit scenes in nightclubs and restaurants. No one wakes up screaming! As IWUS opens, promoter Victor Mature is determined to make waitress Carole Landis a star.  Cronies Alan Mobray and Allyn Joslyn watch closely. A bit abruptly, Landis dumps Mature: she is going to Hollywood!  Just as suddenly, Landis winds up dead and ""the jealous"" Mature is the prime suspect. One of the dicks, a grotesque Laird Kruger pursues Mature as the perp but his colleagues don't buy it.  Director Humberstone cleverly allows a few other suspects to briefly emerge. Most viewers won't suspect Mature since Cruger is so repulsive.  Also, Mature succeeds in gaining the trust of Landis' sister, Betty Grable. They do make a nice pair, fighting for justice. This review won't divulge the resolution but those who remember that true semi-noir classic;  ""Phantom Lady"" will have a ""slight edge"" in guessing who did what to whom.  As stated above, IWUS is not hard core noir, but there are some deft ""dark"" touches-especially when Grable and Mature hide from Cruger in the all night movie theatre. Credit has to be go to the entire supporting cast including the aforementioned Mobray, Joslyn and Cruger but also a smarmy Elisha Cook, Jr. They all add a definite air of realism. It's interesting that 20th Century Fox Boss, Darryl F. Zanuck refused to allow IWUS to be shot in L.A. for fear Hollywood would be ""tarnished!"" New York was chosen instead but viewers will barely notice. (This reviewer will always remember Mature as Doc Holliday in the brooding western ""My Darling Clementine"". True enough, Mobray does a cameo in MDC as a touring actor who gets drunk and forgets his lines to ""Hamlet"". In Tombstome! Only John Ford could pull off a scene like that). The bottom line to IWUS is that this is a solid murder mystery with touches of noir though none of the femmes are fatale. All in a tight 82-minute run time. What's not to like? Highly recommended for true crime devotees!",1114905600,5,2125,4.808219178082192
323566,3,6301302990,"I'm not sure this film is an outstanding example of Film Noir.  I don't say that because it's a bad film; it's just that it lacks many of the typical components of noir, including the trecherous female, the dark musical score (the film uses ""Over the Rainbow""), and the gritty dialogue.  I think the dialogue is the biggest failing here; it's clunky and dated, but not in a colorful, ""Maltese Falcon"" kind of way-- it's just amateurish.  The musical scoring is terrible. It's loud and incongruous.  At one point, in a bar-room scene, Victor Mature tells the bartender to turn the music down.  The reduced volume provided great aural relief, but unfortunately, the decibel level rose up again in the next scene, where the barender was absent and therefore couldn't help us.

The acting was pretty decent, except for Victor Mature. Betty Grable isn't bad at all, though her  doll-face lacked expressiveness.  Carol Landis and Laird Cregar, both of whom died in their 20's/early thirties, gave the best performances.  Landis is a revelation in this movie.  I wonder if the studio executives were worried when they saw her in the daily rushes, because she clearly surpassed leading lady Grable in looks, body, sexiness, and acting. Laird Cregar, who was in his twenties, but looks 45, was one of the only actors in Hollywood who could take bad dialogue and make it sound good.  His weird, hulking, sardonic, and sometimes lonely countenance dominates the film and outclasses it by a mile.  I am a big Cregar fan and I think his participation in this movie is one of the main reasons it's watchable.  Another reason is the unintentionally hilarious swimming scene, clumsily intercut into the film to show off Grable and Mature's bodies.

So, though it's not a great film, there is enough entertainment value in ""Screaming"" to make it worthwhile.  The VHS picture quality and sound are both pretty good. Too bad the movie's not available be on DVD.",1111881600,14,1942,4.860182370820668
323567,4,6301302990,"H. Bruce Humberstone's 1941 ""I Wake Up Screaming"" ironically featured two ill fated stars whose lives ended prematurely.

Victor Mature, playing sports promoter, Frankie Christopher, after beholding Landis' beauty in the restaurant she worked in, was determined to make her a celebrity.  She became noticed and was about to dump Mature to pursue a career in Hollywood.

Since Mature discovered the body, he was implicated.  Landis' sister Jill played by the gorgeously gammed and very attractive Betty Grable believed in Mature's innocence.  She helped him elude the also tragic mountain of a man Laird Cregar, playing Detective Ed Cornell.  Cregar, who died of a heart attack, a result of a massive weight loss,  was persistently attempting to frame Mature for the murder.

323568,5,6301302990,"I recommend I WAKE UP SCREAMING as one of the best of the film noir genre.  I intensely dislike  those film noir that are bathed in violence, depravity, and ugliness; and that don't have a happy ending.  I'm being a little tongue in cheek here, but unceasing gloom and despair are something I like to run away from; I'm not going to sit in front of a screen and drink them in, unless there's something else in the work--some kind of beauty: cinematography, acting, great direction, a messsage, even.  Some of the film noir I've seen have bad acting, bad directing, etc., etc.

Not so I WAKE UP SCREAMING.  It has good everything, and the plot is not one unrelieved cesspool of evil, doom and gloom.  First, there is Betty Grable.  She really lights up a room.  She, like Jean Harlow, is one of the best exponents of ""the American girl.""  She is cheerful, upbeat.  She gets a big kick out of life; she takes it by the horns.  She is also warm, kind, caring, and compassionate.  But she also has street smarts and unabashed survivor instinct.  Don't cross her; she'll fight back.

In this movie Betty fights for her man (very ably played by the very able Victor Mature).  ""Johnny"" has been framed, and the cops are after him.  The theme of the movie is how Betty helps him avoid capture for something he didn't do, and how, in the end, Johnny is exonerated and we find out who the real bad guy is.

The movie is perfect in every way: the characters are believable and sympathetic; the acting is first class; the direction is first class; the set is first class; the atmosphere is first class.

The movie will entertain you; it will keep you on the edge of your seat; it will make you feel good about the world, while still being film noir.",1106265600,7,1737,4.422712933753943

Such incredibility does lend to the unpredictability of the plot-line, though, so the movie can be enjoyable if one doesn't think about it too deeply.  It's also fun to watch Grable in a film noir--and amusing to see how a swimsuit scene is worked into the story!",1033948800,10,591,4.7745098039215685

TITLE:  I Wake Up Screaming (1941)  NR  1:22:11
  Betty Grable, Victor Mature, Carole Landis, Laird Cregar, Alan Mowbray, Allyn Joslyn
  H. Bruce Humberstone (Director)

  A little known (and VASTLY underrated) little film noir gem from the early 1940s. I'm fairly certain that the primary reason that more people haven't heard of this wonderful little movie is its terrible (and TOTALLY unrelated) title  this movie was originally to be released with the title ""Hot Spot"" (which they should have stuck with, since it matches the plot of the movie WAY more than ""I Wake Up Screaming"" does [which, since it sounds like the title to a second-rate horror flick, doesn't match the plot at all]). Oh, well.

  Anyway, if you mainly know Betty Grable through her musical comedies and pin-up posters, then she may strike you as a strange choice for a film noir drama  and, ordinarily you'd be right. However, here she plays it (mostly) straight  but, she does, on occasion, add a little humor to the proceedings (guess she couldn't entirely help herself). Also, any movie that features Allyn Joslyn AND Alan Mowbray in its cast was probably never intended to be taken too seriously anyway. In any case, though the movie does have occasional comedic moments, it is DEFINITELY still a fine example of film noir  with its less-than-scrupulous policemen (which, in, and of, itself, is pretty UNUSUAL for a 1940s American made movie  since the Hayes Code pretty much DICTATED that all law enforcement institutions, and their associated members, should be portrayed as scrupulously honest and virtuous), with its many thinly-veiled salacious remarks, with its rampant sexual tension, and with its (mostly off-screen) violence.

  So, if you are a film noir fan, you gotta check it out  then, tell your friends! Highly recommended.

  NOTE: This movie is one of the films from Fox Home Video's exemplary ""Fox Film Noir"" series of DVDs (and, in some cases, blu-rays). Every one of the DVDs from this series that I have purchased (e.g.this movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallen-Angel-1945/dp/B000CNE088/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallen Angel (1945)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boomerang-1947/dp/B000LN6UHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boomerang!

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  1.33:1  B&W  480p  MPEG-2 (9.2 Mbps)

  Within the confines of the DVD format, this film exhibits good, to  on frequent occasions  VERY good, picture quality; due, in part, I'm sure, to a MUCH higher than average bit-rate than is normally used for a 4:3 (1.33:1) B&W catalogue title. Also, Fox Home Video doesn't state on the box that this movie has been restored or remastered, but it surely looks like it  because, artifacts such as black specks or white dots are nearly non-existent; and, I saw very few hair-lines, nor do I recall seeing any dropped frames. In addition, sharpness and detail (for a DVD [and for a movie of this age]) are usually very good  with the textures and patterns of most hair-styles, clothing and furnishings being easily discernible (although, some scenes were a little soft). Lastly, contrast, gray scale and shadow-detail (again, for a DVD) are pretty good overall, and in some scenes, bordering on excellent (however, a limited number of scenes were a little ""murky"" and exhibited fairly sever black-crush [probably due to inferior source elements]). Overall, this DVD looks good enough that I am definitely NOT too disappointed about NOT having the blu-ray version (which wasn't available anyway, when I bought this DVD version in November of 2013).

AUDIO:  Dolby Digital 2.0 (Dual-Mono, 192 Kbps)

  Fox Home Video has apparently also done some clean-up work on the film's soundtrack, because there are no loud bumps nor objectionably high levels of hiss. Also, dialog is very clear and all voices are easily understood. However, dynamic range is very limited, and there is not much bottom-end nor any top-end to speak of (which makes the musical score and the Foley work all sound a little 'thin', and somewhat less than realistic). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is a monophonic, dialog-driven movie from the early 1940s, its audio presentation has more than acceptable sound quality.

He was then at the  peak of his brief period as a Star character actor....a career shortened by serious health problems directly connected with  the weight which contributed so much to the impact of his performances. What a career he would have had...........but it was not to be. This is one of the earlier (non-starring) roles which brought him so quickly to the public's attention. Together with a fine cast of supporting actors, he provided the three stars with a solid framework, within which their more limited acting skills, were able to shine.  Grable and Landis, make a good impression despite their (mostly) unglamorous clothing and stage setting, while Mature's always modest talents were supported in a manner that made him  appear at his best. It was up to Cregar  (and the solid core of experienced feature talents) to provide the substance.........which they did quite ably.
