8286905,5,B001CDFY32,"If you are looking for some Muhammad Ali action enlight of his passing this is the dvd for you. Host Brian Kenny and others walk you through twelve hours of action featuring the Man. Forget all the other bios on tape, buy this. I found it for $19.00.",1465084800,2,250,4.229166666666667

8286907,4,B001CDFY32,Very good DVD.The last disc # 4 was a little bit of a dissapointment just interviews. The first 3 dvd's had plenty of fights.though.,1411603200,,132,4.541666666666667

8286910,5,B001CDFY32,"great program. not just a display of alis fights  but insights from trainers, foes and the great man himself!! my only disapointment was when after all the build up to the first fraizer fight,not one round of it or their second fight is shown!  the same with all three of the norton bouts.  walk in with admiration for the boxer and you will walk out impressed even more with the man!",1235692800,,384,4.380281690140845
8286911,5,B001CDFY32,"I am a huge boxing fan and have watched all the Ringside shows on ESPN Classic--the Ali show is so thorough--tons of fights, newsreel outtakes with Ali and of course the great commentary from Bert Sugar, host Brian Kenny and their 'who's who' parade of guests--Angelo Dundee; Chuck Wepner, George Chuvalo, D. Ferdie Pacheco..this is a must-have time capsule of Ali's entire career --the Production value is ESPN Top shelf and the gym that they shoot it in looks great---the Ali pre and fight press conferences alone will make you laugh..Ali was priceless...

When will the Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano shows be available ESPN???",1225584000,4,628,4.980952380952381
8286912,3,B001CDFY32,"I was really excited about this dvd when I read about it. I give it the 3 stars because of the amount of fights and footage is in the dvd collection. What really kills the 3 discs,(not counting the forth one, that was the best one out of them all), is that the fights are not shown all the way through. They skip rounds, sometimes 2 or 3 at a time, and after the round is shown, you have to sit there and listen to the ""experts"" talk about the fight. I really don't care what any of them think. Throw their views and all that in a special feature or something. Sometimes they will talk about a round before they show it. It seems like it goes on forever. I fast forward through all that. After a while, it seems like they love to hear themselves talk about a fight. I cant hit the chapter skip, or I'll miss the fight. Every fight has more of them talking about the fight than the actual footage it seems like. All that bothered me more than the way the dvds were placed. It doesnt make sense to me to stack them on top of eachother in a case.",1225065600,19,1043,4.043478260869565
8286913,5,B001CDFY32,"Okay...there have been a smattering of ALI DVDs out over the years...
but this is now officially the big dog of them all weighing in at nearly 10 hours of content.  This I believe was shown on ESPN.  They have commentators talking about each fight and so we don't just have a long line of boxing footage but we also have the press conferences around the fights just wonderful footage for a fan of ALI like myself. The bonus (4th) DVD ,3 plus hours itself!, concentrates on the relationship of ALI and Howard Cosell and ABC's Wide World Of Sports...and alone is a gem worth the price of this set. Its really a single source treasure trove of ALI footage and it all is looking as good as I've ever seen it. Aside from the classic fights we've seen over and over...Liston,Frazier,Foreman...we get many other early fights and later ones..15 fights in total!
the only thing NOT first class is the idiotic container..they've stacked ALL 4 DVDs on top of each other on a single post...which is just asking for trouble and really cheap ...considering the price of this set really tacky.",1224979200,9,1078,4.609375
