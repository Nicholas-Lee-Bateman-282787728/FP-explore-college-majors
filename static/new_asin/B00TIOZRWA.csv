7010490,5,B00TIOZRWA,"(Quoted from Fr. Robert Barron, in the section on Sacrifice)

There is no Communion without Sacrifice, & Sacrifice involves Pain. See before the Fall, there was Communion, we lived in easy fellowship with the Lord.  But after the Fall we'd become off-kiltered. Lost our way. Our powers internally  and externally had become compromised. It's very difficult for us to maintain Communion because we are always fighting against our interior problems, fighting against sin. For in a World-Gone-Wrong, you've got to expect Sacrifice. There's got to be some Pain involved as we are wrenched back onto line, when we become properly aligned in Communion with the Lord.",1381449600,3,660,5.2075471698113205

7010496,5,B00TIOZRWA,"This DVD covers an extended lecture by Fr Robert Barron on the nature of the Eucharist within the Catholic Church. It is divided into three parts - Sacred Meal, Sacrifice, and Real Presence. These are given by Fr Barron from a lecture he gave at a church to some of its parish members. This is not therefore done in the same style as the Catholicism Series that he later went on to head, so do not go into this expecting the same lofty production values.

These three parts all delve deeply into the meaning of the Eucharist for Catholics, and deal strongly with its Biblical basis, especially looking at its foretelling and relation to the Old Testament, and then on to the New.

I found that most of the first two parts were new to me in regards to previous material from Fr Barron, and I learned a lot from them. However, for those that have seen the Catholicism Series, a lot of the third part will not be so new. Of course this does not detract from the message at all, as of course these points are very important.

All in all, this is a very good DVD on the Catholic theological understanding of the Eucharist for anyone wanting to understand the Church's teaching on this sacrament, and to delve deeper into the Biblical basis for such a belief.",1362009600,31,1253,4.439130434782609

8701911,5,B00TIOZRWA,"I am impressed of what it is to be celebrating the Eucharist.

That I don't know, but I know he is there in the Eucharist. Amen.",1442188800,,326,4.109375
8701912,3,B00TIOZRWA,not as interesting as I thought it would be.  Subject matter is so important and amazing.
