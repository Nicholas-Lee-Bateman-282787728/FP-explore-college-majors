4395956,5,B004K94Q3E,"This DVD is a great visual study aid for those of us who are beginner fencing students.  The techniques shown are precisely those I have learned in my classes, and they are demonstrated clearly.  I agree with the other reviews that the close-up and slow motion footage is invaluable for home practice.  I am so glad I purchased this DVD.",1298937600,4,337,4.583333333333333
4395957,5,B004K94Q3E,"As I am writing this review it is my 4th week of Foil fencing and this DVD is exactly what I needed.  In my beginner class, a lot of terms and techniques are shown to us very quickly.  This DVD is great for breaking down and showing each fencing move so that I can practice and reinforce what I have learned in the class at home. Effective attacks and parries are shown with great detail showing proper foil and footwork.  A good investment.",1297555200,9,441,4.289156626506024

8432598,5,B004K94Q3E,I started fencing lessons a few weeks ago. This vid arrived a few days ago. It is a perfect supplement to my regular twice a week training. I can continue to work on my own between classes now. Perfecting my stance and learning different attacks and parries. It shows in detail and breaks down each move. This is a very well made DVD that you should buy if you are a beginner or intermediate. I recommend this vid to anyone wanting to supplement their regular training. You won't be sorry :).,1348963200,2,492,4.417582417582418
8432599,5,B004K94Q3E,"As far as beginners DVD on fencing goes, I would rate this the best. It is thorough, detailed and easy to understand.

The camera angles are unique so as to allow the viewing a clear image of what technique or lessons is being taught. As mentioned it is also very thorough, covering basic stances to strikes and much in between.

I would use this as a Fencing 101 standard; that is, if you are teaching or learning the foil, this is THE DVD to start. More complete than any other I have ever seen by far.

Professional. Thorough. Detailed.

Highly recommended.",1310860800,5,560,4.514851485148514
