7990977,5,B00009KNT1,We are studying WWII in New Mexico.  The Dine are a big part of our culture.  I wanted my students to know how important a role this courageous people played in our history,1491004800,,172,4.181818181818182
7990978,2,B00009KNT1,"Somewhat disappointing since very little emphasis was given to the code talking done by the Navajo Marines.  I guess that Nicholas Gage is the star, so it was more about him and his love-hate relationship with one of the Navajos.  Also, too much war violence for my tastes.",1488844800,,273,4.666666666666667
7990979,2,B00009KNT1,"The fighting scenes are too long and the violence drags on and on. I know this is a war movie, but the killing and gunfire could have been edited for a better movie overall. I lost patience and definitely lost interest.",1475625600,,219,4.365853658536586
7990980,3,B00009KNT1,"Nicolas Cage plays Joe Enders a wounded Marine, soul survivor of 15 men fighting a battle during WWII. He is a Marine through and through. He wants to get back to battle and even fakes his wellness to be released from the hospital. Still feeling the sting of the guilt by the loss of his men, he is given a new assignment: to protect and guard with his own life, that of a Navajo soldier. One of an exceptional group, that has been intensely trained in the art of wartime code. Ben Yahzee is considered THE Code, and must be protected at all costs, never to fall into the hands of the Japanese.

Enders is unhappy with this assignment, but he lives by a code as well... To Do Or Die. Although resentful of the ""babysitting"" job, he obeys his orders to the fullest - putting himself in harm's way to protect ""the code"". Yahzee does his job of decoding and does it well, but must endure physical abuse and racial slurs from some of the other soldiers. As Enders sees the importance of Yahzee's existence to the war, and gets to know him as a person, he begins to warm to him and eventually holds him in the highest esteem.

I love War films, especially WWII films, and most especially, those based on actual events. I have viewed this film twice over the last few years, and twice it lost me a little over halfway through the 2 hours and 15 minutes of it. The story, Directed by action great John Woo, is an important one to American History and one that makes us aware of the very integral part the ""Windtalkers"" played in the war - probably saving hundreds of lives by their own heroic actions. I just felt it took too long to tell the  story. The script did not allow me to feel about the characters the same way I did, say, for the soldiers in Saving Private Ryan, that had to protect Ryan with their own lives. The action sequences were great, but there was so much of it, it was hard to warm to the personal stories.

Probably a good rental for war buffs or just to see what the ""Windtalkers"" were all about; but may not stand up to repeated viewings.......Laurie",1439510400,,2067,4.319587628865979
7990981,5,B00009KNT1,"WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.",1414972800,2,2385,4.935323383084577
