506205,4,6302703786,"This documentary has very entertaining footage that makes you laugh and  cry at the same time.  It sends shivers down your spine when you hear what  public officials were saying during early days of the cold war.  Many times  there were references to the ""will of God"" in the same sentence  there were references to nuclear weapons and testing and it just horrified  me.  Looking back it all looks very silly but people took themselves very  serious then.  Today we take ourselves very serious.  It makes you wonder  how we will look back on ourselves at this current time.  What are we going  to think, in the future, of our current speak of profits and competition,  of downsizing, corporate synergy, aggressive advertising promising that  some product will make us happy?  Or, will it be something else that we  will cringe at the sound of hearing?",965779200,9,851,4.751724137931035
506206,5,6302703786,"Wow this movie is an eye opener. After watching it I can believe in almost any conspiracy theory,because they all sound more reasonable than the truth about the Government's Atomic testing programs. Back then people were told  that mny forms of radiation will bounce harmlessly off human skin! Hosts of  Kid Tv shows talked about bomb shelter preparedness! No wonder everyone  went nuts in the 60's. It was backlash against all the ""Atomic  War"" talk. Children were regularily reminded in classs that an A-bomb  could hit at any time. Hmm explains alot about the Boomers.  You probably  already know that this movie is a collection of propaganda films shown in  America to calm the fears of the public over nuclear war. It's brilliantly  edited. Hope the makers have a long and prolific career. Some of it is VERY  funny when you look back at the attitudes of the time. There's a great part  where Nixon appears on a variety show with Nikita Kruschev, and Nikita  makes Dick look pretty shabby as they attempt to one up each other on  Aamerican national Tv. When you lack the people skills of even a hard line  Communist Premiere then you know you're in trouble. Ah Dick, you should  have learned.  The most important message I got from this film is that the  Gov't needs to be watched very closely to ensure its honesty. There are too  many agendas floating around Washington that don't have the public's best  interest in mind. Don't accept anything that is spoon fed to you because  it's probably a load of crap. Except irradiated food, I'm sure the Gov't  wouldn't let that happen if it wasn't safe. NOT!",957916800,11,1608,4.691756272401434

It features a wide assortment of clips: army training films, educational films, TV shows, newsclips--all centered around  Americans' attempts to grapple with the reality of ""the bomb.""  While it certainly is outrageously funny, it also reminds the viewer that  real people suffered from Cold War atomic ignorance, and that our  government, while not always deliberately lying, at least didn't know what  it was talking about half the time.

I fail to understand what is so silly about the ""duck and cover"" drills. Of  course at ground zero  duck and cover is useless,but the blast wave will  travel miles,causing less and less destruction as it moves out. The tips to  duck and cover,to avoid looking at the flash,and protecting oneself from  fallout are all very commonsensical. Nuclear bombs are not all powerful,they  have limits,and following the advice in the movie would have prevented  thousands of casualties from flying glass,falling rubble,and the like.

THE ATOMIC CAFE: This collection of newsreel footage and clips from propaganda films presents the history of atomic weapons in the U.S., from the day of their creation on into the Cold War, focusing mainly on the myths and madness they inspired in the `50s.

In the opening interview, Paul Tibbets, pilot of the Enola Gay, describes his bomb run on Hiroshima as ""a perfectly ordinary and routine thing"" --until he saw the damage. This single sound bite summarizes the entire film, which portrays the atomic innocence and subsequent education of an entire society. With no narration other than the soundtracks of the clips, the days of the A-bomb and H-bomb, of Civil Defense sirens and home bomb shelters, are preserved in a time capsule as frightening, embarrassing and hilarious as any home movie.

In one sense, this movie is a real-life horror film. When military experts explain to foot soldiers prior to an ""atomic maneuver"" that there's no need to worry about radiation, then send them heading toward a mushroom cloud just seconds after detonation, the sight is as horrifying as it is surreal. Yet ""Atomic Caf"" is as funny as it is chilling: We chuckle nervously at ourselves for being so naive about atomic weapons and radiation, and for buying official defenses like the ludicrous ""duck and cover.""

In a beautifully choreographed finale, previous clips are recombined to illustrate the Final Nightmare: an Atomic Attack on America, from alert to event. Dad's wise advice to his nuclear family in their post-holocaust bunker: ""Nothing to do now but wait for orders from the authorities and relax."" With its twisted humor, quiet irony and almost nostalgic tone, ""Atomic Caf"" is a fascinating, discomfiting document about the nuclear madness of the 1950s--the innocence and guilt; the facts, the follies, and the outright lies.",1422489600,,2093,4.9375

I would like to add that so far every ""duck and cover"" film I've seen was produced in the very early 1950s. That is before 1955.

506531,3,6302703786,"I first saw ""The Atomic Cafe"" in the theater years ago. It was a peculiar independent release and was poorly attended. I had thought of it many times in the years since then, and finally picked up a copy on DVD. While I enjoyed revisiting the pseudo-documentary, I didn't enjoy it as much the second time. With the passing of time the slanted editing and editorial choices are more clearly obvious than they were to me upon first seeing it. Certainly Bert the turtle and the classic ""Duck and Cover"" exercise are legendary, and much of the footage is genuinely entertaining, but while people who are young now may find this all very silly, if you lived through any of the cold war it was not at all funny.

Understand that this is not an unbiased historical document, but in fact a type of pacifist propaganda all its own. Editing makes Nixon and Reagan look particularly dim, despite history ultimately vindicating their pro-democracy positions. In 1982 Nixon was still a disgraced former President, and Reagan was new to the national scene and reviled by the left; this nuance will also be lost on viewers too young to remember the actual events of the cold war, but it is worth pointing out. (For a prime example of biased editing, watch for Nixon's proclamation about mental health week.)

The film is difficult to classify: it's a black comedy in places, but in other places it is suddenly and alarmingly just...well...black (radiation burns are never funny; radiation harm to animals is, if anything, even harder to watch.) There is a lot of interesting footage here, but some is simply ghastly. That's the contradiction here: nuclear weapons and the destruction they are capable of are no laughing matter, yet most of this movie treats the subject breezily; when pigs with severe radiation burns are suddenly shown, it's a juxtaposition that doesn't work. If you are interested in the cold war and Civil Defense from that time frame, this is a valuable film to watch; likewise if you are too young to remember the cold war (or just barely remember snippets of it) this may be a worthwhile exploration. I enjoyed it much more as a teenager in the theater than I did as an adult, but that's neither good nor bad, it's just the way things are.",1386115200,,2247,4.7150127226463106

506600,5,6302703786,"Majority of the low star reviews all complain that there is nothing comedic about living in an era of constant fear, although I agree, have we not seen this same type of fear and paranoia today? If there ever was a nuclear blast on US soil many would die if not instantly, then from the mass exposure to radiation, the footage from these films feels more like the governments way of reassuring the American people the best they could in a time of complete uncertainty. After all, a country can only be as strong as its people and as stated This helped us sleep better at night. This film just goes to show the full scale of what happens when you act first and think later, and by this I particularly mean our use and threats of repeat use of nuclear weapons without fully understanding its effects on the environment, animals and people exposed in its aftermath. More importantly this should serve as a stark reminder that human kind is certainly not immortal and despite our invincibility at times, everyone falls at one point or another.
There is a combination of black and white footage as well as colour footage that although sometimes grainy are excellent material sources IMO. Considering the quality of the footage the sound quality reminds me of the textured recordings from VHS tapes or that which youd hear from playing a record. I happen to like it and think it gives more depth and character but viewers who are used to the quality of DVDs and Blue-Rays may find this irritating or disappointing. Footage shown includes the preparation and deployment of our nuclear attack on Japan (Nagasaki), the effects of radiation, testing footage from Bikini, and a mash up of news and movie clips as well as many government made informational films. The content speaks for itself and is easy to watch for many ages, I would recommend watching this documentary to get an understanding of the era primarily America once lived in.",1384992000,2,1929,4.72700296735905

506608,5,6302703786,"I remember having seen this movie in 1980 or so, when it featured in German cinemas. It is simply a collection of educational films by various US agencies showing the population how to 'survive' a nuclear war. I remember the horror I felt realizing that those guys really deemed a nuclear war executable, and I left with the feeling that it was the closest thing to a miracle one can imagine that mankind survived the 1950s.

These feelings were brought back when I watched the movie again on DVD. The same sensation of hair rising on my neck... I wonder if the younger generation, grown up after 1989, is able to understand the basic anti-war message going with this movie, or if it just deems it a funny recollection of a weird world on the brink of destruction. And I wonder if they ever realize how close mankind was to utter self-destruction back then. (It still is, but in a much less spectacular fashion. Another lesson to be learned...)

506654,5,6302703786,"I'm one of those people who love documentaries. I own several and watch them whenever I can on television.

I am also very fascinated with the Atomic Age, specifically those early years of wonder, fear, and uncertainty between 1946-1963. I have even written papers on this subject on the academic level and possess a degree in History. Suffice to say I know a little bit about the subject.

I say all of that so that you may know this review comes from experience. I've sampled a lot of documentaries on this era, and the Atomic Cafe is simply the best.

Here's why,
The documentary is a compilation, a collage of stock footage from the aforementioned era from such sources as news reports, military instruction films, public safety films, etc. and NOTHING else. There is no narration, no modern embellishments. The clips are pasted together to form a sort of satirical story of the era, accurately showing you the transition from wonder and pride when America alone had the Bomb, to fear and uncertainty when Russia developed the Bomb, to deception and denial with shelters, and finally the acceptance of the philosophy of MAD.

What makes it all great is there is no opinion given, no conclusions drawn, just history in the raw. You figure it out, you piece it together. What do you think about all this? It does not plant ideas in your head, or give you a partisan view.

It is, essentially, a film of constant Primary Sources, straight from the horse's mouth, which is more than you could ever ask for in a documentary.",1356825600,,1523,4.689138576779026

This movie only fueled my distaste for nuclear arms, and served to enlighten me culturally on an age not too long ago. The documentary pointedly displays archived PSAs as borderline propaganda, while occasionally juxtaposing actual experts contrary knowledge of day while not resorting to polemics.

The comedy of duck and cover is short lived. The sobering realization that a nation that stood for justice and liberty for half a century propagated false information inciting fear and to fanning the flames of conflict, leads to a terrifying climax.

The US government,needing an enemy to focus it's mistrust and inherent hate upon, chose Communism and the Soviets. The ""cold war' was fueled in it's entirety by US paranoia. WE fueled the arms race, WE fueled the Moon race. In order to protect us from a percieved threat, millions of words of US propaganda were churned out. This movie depicts some of the fear this country fomented with it's irrational fear of Communism.

506730,5,6302703786,"Atomic Cafe (1982) is a scathing documentary on the atomic age created from archival film from the 40s-early 60s.  The scope of the material is extensive: military training films (often the most morbidly hilarious and poorly acted of the bunch), television news, various other government-produced propaganda films - they convey the American fear and obsession with atomic weapons and their disastrous consequences (both historical and potential).

The first third is more historical in nature -- it shows clips the atomic bombs dropping on Nagasaki and Hiroshima (with interviews with the pilots), the effects of radiation, the jubilation at the end of the war, and (one of the more uncomfortable sections to watch) American soldiers explaining to the Bikini Atoll islanders that their home will soon be the site of nuclear testings (and they smile, and laugh, and occasionally look bewildered).

The last two thirds of the film is less chronological and consists of various propaganda films.  Of course we see the notorious Duck and Cover.... But some of the others are just as good/bizarre/uncanny/morbid:  a boy whose radiation protection suit is made partially from oven mits, overweight school girls in deadpan voices describing how to put together fallout shelter provisions, scenes of Nixon and Krushchev, the effects of atomic weapon radiation on hair, the effects of radiation on pigs, towns which experiment with Stalinism, various fallout shelters, and fathers rationalizing that at least food will be easier to find if most of the population is killed by a blast, etc etc.

What strikes the viewer immediately is the complete lack of narration (besides the original narration in the film clips).  Instead a WONDERFUL sound track of atomic age inspired songs create a surprisingly horrific atmosphere.  For example:

A wealth of fascinating clips can be found here -- and of course with the advent of youtube and imdb.com the actual documentaries and songs can be tracked down online.

506780,5,6302703786,"'Atomic Cafe' presented this subject in the best possible way. Made early in the 1980's this takes old news reel footage,interviews,educational and US Army training videos and footage of many atom bomb tests from the ""atomic age"",starting from D-Day up until the end up the 50's and strings them together without any modern commentary,as if they're one long film in and of themselves. Of course the paranoia of this era need not be discussed;this footage all speak for itself. We begin at the end of WWII when the atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima so,while America is ""celebrating victory"" the innocent civilians of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki are suffering the after effects of the then largely unknown radiation poisoning. The whole film plays out that way;America is finding different ways to justify the merrits of the atom bomb,and eventually the hydrogen bomb so they can ""maintain freedom"" while the soldiers and often innocent civilians,such as those from the Bikini islands are displaced for the sake of the ""progress"" that comes along with the development of this new technology. In the end this attitude gives way to outright paranoia;atomic weapons become linked with communism after the very unpleasant death (some would say murder) of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and the vulgarities of the McCarthy hearings that followed. In the end America and the Soviet Union of course are head to head and...well the outcome is up for much debate even today. Now for my opinion. Considering that both my parents grew up during this time (my dad during it,my mom at the tail end of it)it's no doubt that the generation that were children during the events depicted in this films became a bit self indulgent,even if they're views and intentions were essentially the correct ones-to live in peace with each other. It explains without doubt where the ""live for today"" attiude comes from. So  watching this film with my folks my dad especially probably viewed some of it as part of the instruction manual of his youth. To me it serves very much as a blackly comic warning (one we often still have trouble confronting today) to learn from the machines of violence and not allow it to box us into a culture of fear.",1232236800,2,2211,4.896
506781,5,6302703786,"If you're of a certain age, you'll recall duck-and-cover drills when your teachers told you to slide under your desk, face away from the windows, and cover your head.  These exercises were practice, just in case the Soviet Union decided to drop an atomic bomb or two while you were learning your times tables.  This was the 1950's, a time of nationwide paranoia about the Bomb.
 ""The Atomic Cafe"" is a wonderfully nostalgic, often hilarious documentary about those days when the government produced instructional films about how to survive a nuclear attack, with announcers in stentorian tones assuring Americans that anyone can withstand a nuclear attack if simple rules were followed.  Director Kevin Rafferty has assembled in this 1982 film vintage clips, music from military training films, campy advertisements, presidential speeches, and pop songs that revolve around the apprehension surrounding the relatively new atomic bomb.
 What makes the movie a hoot today is the propaganda and lopsided optimism of the Fabulous Fifties.  The editing creates much of the film's irony, such as footage of a totally leveled Hiroshima braided into suburban duck-and-cover routines with actors who look like June and Ward Cleaver's next-door neighbors.  However, the film also illustrates how pervasive America's obsession with the new bomb was and how advertisers latched onto the word ""atomic"" the way they later embraced the phrase ""new and improved.""
 ""The Atomic Cafe"" has more than its share of jaw-dropping moments.  Average folks compare a nuclear holocaust to a tornado that rages for a few seconds and then quickly calms down.  A California man proudly states that after most of his neighbors die in an attack by the Soviets, extra food will be available for prepared families like his.  A happy, middle-class American family heads for their bomb shelter, equipped with a periscope.  Two school girls display twelve Mason jars filled with bomb shelter provisions they made in their home economics class.  The sense one gets is that nuclear war was sold to the American people as a bearable inconvenience, not unlike a two-hour power outage.
 The icing on the cake in this two-disc Collector's Edition is eight complete government propaganda films, including ""Self Preservation in an Atomic Attack"" (1950), ""Duck and Cover"" (1951), and ""Our Cities Must Fight"" (1951).  These black-and-white movies are both funny and creepy in that they were shown all over America and peddled distorted ideas about the potency not only of the atomic bomb itself, but of the devastating effects of radiation poisoning.",1230422400,2,2603,5.253623188405797

506835,5,6302703786,"The Atomic Cafe gives us an excellent look at the development of the atomic bomb, the H bomb and the repercussions it had on the world, including America. Although some parts provide black humor, I saw things like the ""duck and cover"" scenes as being symptomatic of a time when people truly thought America could at any time come under nuclear attack by its arch enemy, the former Soviet Union.

The film begins with the test detonation of an atom bomb in the desert of New Mexico and proceeds roughly chronologically to tell the story of how the atom bomb helped to end World War II. We get footage of the bomb's mushroom cloud after it was dropped on Hiroshima; and there is a plethora of footage and film clips from the era regarding how government taught Americans to think about the bomb as the tool to destroy all our enemies. We also see much paranoia fueling these government films which are often little more than poorly disguised propaganda films of the day.

However, a closer look reveals the absolute obsession Americans experienced about the threat of the Soviet Union to rob them of their ""American dream."" Communism was fought against vigorously--not just in Congress but in the form of protest marches, films churned out by the American government and radio and TV talk shows of the day. I could not help but feel sympathy for people who genuinely believed that at any moment an enemy like the Soviet Union could destroy almost all of Los Angeles, Minneapolis or New York. I remember how I myself had those fears at times when I was a young boy.

Overall, the footage and the pace of the documentary provide us with excellent insight about how Americans thought and dealt with the newborn atomic age during tough times; and this film held my attention well.

The DVD comes with few extras. We get scene selections and credits but little else. Oh, well.

The Atomic Cafe is indeed a cult classic; and it also makes for a rather interesting look at the abject fear and dread Americans truly experienced at a time when the ""cold, cold war"" between America and the Soviets was full blown. I highly recommend it for people studying this period in time.

506839,5,6302703786,"I saw ""Atomic Cafe"" when it first came out in 1982, and the film has lost none of its zip in the intervening years. The film is a montage of military and civilian footage of Americans attempting to deal with the destructive enormity of atomic power, overlain with the cheesiest A-bomb related period music. Starting with an interview with an unapologetic Paul Tibbetts (who flew the Enola Gay on its bombing run over Hiroshima) through the Nixon-Khrushchev ""kitchen debates"" of the 1950s, the film takes us on a wild and irreverent ride through an America terrified by the prospect of instant annihilation.

What's neat is that the movie is not narrated except by the voices of the times. President Eisenhower urges America (in its consumer greatness) not to panic. Bert the Turtle teaches a generation of children to duck and cover when they see the atomic flash. Government films urge the country into fallout shelters where they can wait a few minutes before coming up to take a look around and start the arduous job of straightening the picture frames knocked askew by the blast. Catholic clergy are filmed dispensing the government to build the bomb and permitting homeowners to stock ""protective devices"" in their shelters against those poor souls trying to get in.

The torrent of disinformation and misinformation is fascinating, and would be funnier if the possibility of nuclear war were not so real. Ironic too is the population's level of trust in a government clearly unwilling to level with it about the level of destruction that the bomb would perpetrate.

The film mis-stepped only once, in allowing for sympathy to the Rosenbergs. Subsequent years have shown that they most probably did give nuclear secrets to the Soviets. I can feel pity for their children and abhor their executions without excusing their wickedness.

""Atomic Cafe"" does have an agenda. By juxtaposing pictures of children hiding under beds and school desks with images of the obliteration of bombed test homes, it makes clear the fact that nuclear war is not the mostly-survivable thing that might lead some to complacency about atomic attack. The film does not stint on showing the horrors of nuclear attack and fallout. As such, it has done a great service by laying out the true cost of atomic warfare as well as of blindly trusting those who control the detonation of those awful weapons.

It was backlash against all the ""Atomic War"" talk. Children were regularily reminded in classs that an A-bomb could hit at any time. Hmm explains alot about the Boomers. You probably already know that this movie is a collection of propaganda films shown in America to calm the fears of the public over nuclear war. It's brilliantly edited. Hope the makers have a long and prolific career. Some of it is VERY funny when you look back at the attitudes of the time. There's a great part where Nixon appears on a variety show with Nikita Kruschev, and Nikita makes Dick look pretty shabby as they attempt to one up each other on Aamerican national Tv. When you lack the people skills of even a hard line Communist Premiere then you know you're in trouble. Ah Dick, you should have learned. The most important message I got from this film is that the Gov't needs to be watched very closely to ensure its honesty.

On top of all these profound issues, it is also very entertaining/involving - one of those films that you start watching and cannot tear yourself away, because you JUST GOTTA HEAR/SEE the next outrageous clip.

506844,5,6302703786,"This movie is great but I want to discuss one part of it I have not seen mentioned in any reviews. This movie has Jerry Mathers and Hugh Beaumont!!!!!!!!!! (Beaver and his dad of Leave It To Beaver). I was bowled over when I saw them. They are in separate scenes and Beaver has a haircut I never saw him wear on Leave It To Beaver. Hugh Beaumont(Ward Cleaver) is in some kind of military educational or propoganda film.

  Anyway, I am a child of the the time and remember being scared silly during the 60's by all the talk of nuclear war. We had all the sirens going off all the time and even the duck and cover drills at school. In the early 60's jets were always flying over and I worried when one would be the enemy with an atomic bomb about to drop it on my house. My father even built a bomb shelter in the back yard during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

  This movie reaaly has some funny scenes. One is where Richard Nixon is trying to be JOVIAL with Nikita Krushev(sp ??). Nixon says something like ""Well you may be ahead of us in the space program but we are ahead in color televisions"". What an idiot ole Tricky Dickey was. Another shows a man coming out of an under house shelter. A reporter asks him about what he will do after an atomic attack. He says ""Well, if they drop the bomb it will kill about 90 percent of the US population and that will just mean more food and water for the rest of us"". PRICELESS!!! But the funniest scene is when a reporter is asking questions of the military troops who have just witnessed an atomic test explosion up close and personal in the desert. He asks one soldier what that device is he is wearing around his neck. The soldier very calmly says, ""It will tell me if I have been exposed to a LETHAL dose of radiation or not"". MEGA PRICELESS!!!!

 This movie is a must see and I'm so glad I've added it to my collection and I suggest you do the same.",1139184000,8,1895,4.1726027397260275
506885,4,6302703786,"A Dr. Stangelove-like documentary about the atom bomb and the country's response to the possibility of nuclear war with Russia in the 1950s-60s. Using only government propaganda footage, the movie is both sad and funny: bomb tests using army troops as subjects, the Red scare, building bomb shelters, etc. The ending is a mock attack on the US, with people running to air raid shelters and surveying the ""damage"" afterward.

Viewed from this distance it seems almost insane what people back then went through, although I remember as a kid participating in air raid drills at school where we were taken into the basement of the school where canned food and bottled water was stored, and where we could expect to spend weeks perhaps if a nuclear attack occurred. I don't know what the adults were thinking, but to a kid it was pretty scary and very real. There is some great usage of topical songs in the movie. It's all a mind-bending look at one aspect, at least, of life in the US a generation ago.",1135555200,2,999,4.6440677966101696

But I guess it was always there, in a way. You know - ""Don't worry! The government can handle anything."" There are moments when you laugh, and quite a few that tug at your heart. The juxtaposition of sound and image is simultaniously spooky and funny. The song ""Let the H-Bomb Fall"" fades out, and we see the nightime shot of the demon-orange glow of the Castle-Bravo test explosion. Even the plain white text that the dates and explosion names are put in gives me chills. And say what you want, but the Bikini Atoll explosion is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. Amazing. Particularly good is the end, where the filmmakers use all this footage to create the end of the world.

506887,5,6302703786,Being born in 1950 I have the (mis)fortune to have experienced a few paradigm shifts in the U.S. political mindset. Atomic Cafe brought back too many reminders of my living in a world gone nuts. From the age of about 13 till my late 20's I have had excruciating nightmares of bombers flying overhead and Los Angeles being captured in the photographic flash of annihilation. As an older adult I have re-experienced the nightmare through this film. Perhaps its impact is diminished to audiences born later than I. But I pray that the message will nonetheless pluck a string of mortal fear at our government's casual stockpiling of weapons in response to an illusory and paranoid perception that some country some where may have more nukes than we do.,1115683200,4,748,4.8062015503875966
506888,4,6302703786,"You will see the bewildered soliders slowing walking TOWARD a big mushroom cloud in the nuclear test field.  You see small kids hiding behind the curtain while hearing the song 'Duck and Cover.'  And a kind animated turtle will teach you how to survive if an H-Bomb drops in your neighborhood.

Those are just part of what you see in 'The Atomic Cafe' (1982) which is a unique documentary without using any narrations.  Now the point is too clear.  The film consists of various archival footages such as newsreels and educational (or propaganda) films about A bombs and H bombs, all tactfully edited and joined to show us how the American people saw the world, vaguely scared of something terrible, during the nuclear age.  It's the time of a Rosenberg case.  You can see then vice-president Richard Nixon.

The most startling thing about the film is, like Michael Moore (when he does not forget humor), that the contents are unwittingly chilling and hilarious at times.  During the military briefing, an officer is seen lecturing before the soldiers what an A bomb is like.  According to him, we should remember only three things -- Blast, Heat, and Radiation, and the last one is least dangerous.  Hence, their marching to the cloud, exposure to the (probably) lethal doze of radioactive fallings.  I'm not blaming anybody.  But the total effects of this scene alone are horrifying enough.

I said something about Michael Moore.  Actually Moore is indirectly related to the film, for he visited this film's co-director Kevin Rafferty after seeing this film, to learn how to make a documentary film.  And it seems Kevin Rafferty was kind enough to teach a few things about filmmaking to the future director of 'Roger and Me' (1989).  In fact, Kevin Rafferty is the cinematographer of Michael Moore's debut film.

More interesting trivia.  Among the three people credited as directors -- Jayne Loader, Kevin Rafferty, Pierce Rafferty -- the last two happen to be the cousins of George W. Bush, President of the United States.  I'm not kidding.  Though the fact has nothing to do with the contents of the film, it is  kind of bizarre to find Moore and Bush associated with this film, even though indirectly.

The film's argument may sound sometimes a bit too provocative with graphic images (including burnt skins which is painful to see), and the editing is sometimes too slack, but 'The Atomic Cafe' is a fascinating look on the way how people acted and reacted during the most politically unstable era after the WWII.",1112572800,9,2519,4.875294117647059
506889,4,6302703786,"I was listening to a country western song on the radio and it reminded me of the closing song in ""Atomic Cafe"".  I haven't seen that movie in 20 years but I remember it well.  It is an interesting idea for a movie; flims clips about the Atomic Bomb from the 40's and 50's.  We were a nation (and a world) that was sorting out just exactly what we should or shouldn't do with this new-found weapon of mass destruction.  I remember the duck and cover drills in school and I especially remember my somewhat elderly and somewhat overweight teacher trying to get under her desk when the alarm sounded.

There are a lot of reminders of that era in ""Atomic Cafe"" and those of us who remember that time can laugh at a lot that we see.  The bomb shelters are still out there.  When we were looking to buy a house some years ago, we looked at one that had a bomb shelter in the basement.  I thought of an old ""Twilight Zone"" episode and envisioned it as my reading room.  However, that was about all that that house had to offer.  For those who weren't around back then, this movie may fit somewhere between frightening and ridiculous.

We still have the atomic bomb these days and the potential users of those weapons are scarier than were the ones in the ""Atomic Cafe"" era.  Hopefully, we will still be able to watch this movie and laugh for generations to come.",1098489600,4,1354,4.329365079365079
506890,5,6302703786,"This is a highly entertaining propaganda documentary film aimed at exposing the official and not-so-official lies and paranoia of the Cold War years here in the United States.  The movie came out in the early 1980s, at a time when the Cold War was at its most dangerous peak of tension since the early 1960s. It was a time when fictitious ""windows of vulnerability"", like earlier imaginary ""missile gaps"", were being concocted to justify a provocative and dangerous arms build-up. I remember how eagerly those of us who supported a nuclear freeze watched the film for evidence of the fundamental mendacity of the ""winnable nuclear war"" theorizing, which had been revived by the first-term Reagan administration after more than a decade in which most rational people simply assumed that everyone now knew that no one could really win a nuclear war.  It seemed like we were back in the days of fall-out shelters and air raid drills, Failsafe scenarios and Dr. Strangelove.  This film was welcome relief and support from the revived prospect of global annihilation, when the Reagan administration argued that we needed even MORE overkill, although we could already blow up the world three or four times with the tens of thousands of nuclear warheads we already had. Insanity, sheer insanity.

  The film stands up very well.  It effectively exposes the way in which government propaganda attempted to make the prospect of nuclear war bearable by comparing its risks to ordinary household dangers, and by suggesting that civil defense might protect us from the worst that the Bomb might do.  All nonsense, as the experts quoted on film here pointed out.  It still is chilling to see how lightly some of these government and military officials, and movie actors playing government officials in propaganda films, seemed to present these dangers (this film came out about the same time as ""War Games"", which also underlined the futility of global thermonuclear annihilation, and which, I understand, very much impressed President Reagan with the dangers of nuclear war, or at least the possibility that such a war might be started by accident).

  Much of ""Atomic Cafe"" is just plain funny; atomic cocktails and ""Bert the Turtle"" can't help but raise a grin.  The juxtaposition of scenes and rhetoric and the ironic use of background music bring a chuckle, and let's face it, much of that 1950s Cold War rhetoric was simply corny.  Other points in the film are powerfully moving, as with the images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki bomb victims, descriptions of the execution of the Rosenbergs, and the images of the people on the Bikini Atoll being removed from their island homes.

  The film probably won't persuade anyone who believes that nuclear war really is winnable, or at least not such a big deal IF it is kept ""limited"" (since, as one Cold Warrior memorably put it, we would ONLY lose 20 million people and the Russians would lose 80 million, and body counts don't lie -- was that Dr. Herman Kahn, in ""On Thermonuclear War"" or ""Thinking About the Unthinkable""?), and it probably won't convince die-hard Cold Warriors that Cold War paranoia and excesses could be dangerous to our liberties at home, or at the very least absurd (Stalinists in Mosinee, Wisconsin? -- what did they put in their cheese?).  And the national security empire created during the 1940s and 1950s created new levels of secrecy and surveillance in our society that, however nececessary, still must be balanced against the need for information and open discussion in a free democratic society.

  I think Reagan in his second term did come around to a better understanding of the implications of nuclear war, and while I am no fan of his administration (very far from it), I think it is true that the risk of superpower intercontinental nuclear war abated considerably after 1986, thanks both to Reagan and Gorbachev. Nobody in the Reagan administration during Reagan's second term was talking about surviving a nuclear war by getting under a few shovel scoops of dirt (think I'm kidding?  Read ""With Enough Shovels: Reagan, Bush, and Nuclear War,"" by Robert Scheer, 1982). Today the Soviet Union is gone, but the danger of nuclear weapons is no less real.  Indeed, it may even be greater today in the age of terror than it was back when both the Soviets and Americans, however ruthless they might have been, both wanted to come out of the rivalry in one piece, alive (The desire to survive is an essential precondition for deterrence to work; for a fine study of the deterrence problem and critique of Herman Kahn's work, see Philip Green, ""Deadly Logic:The Theory of Nuclear Deterrence"", 1968).

  ""The Atomic Cafe"" is funny and yet contains a serious cautionary tale for present generations.  And it is strange, when suicide-bomber terrorists are turning fully loaded passenger planes into guided missiles for mass murders, chopping off heads, blowing up buses, and itching to get their hands on the most murderous weapons of mass destruction available, that we might actually come to feel some nostalgia for an apparently simpler time when, however dangerous things might have been, we did not actually blow the world up.",1097712000,11,5194,4.974566473988439
506891,5,6302703786,"As I watched the Atomic Cafe I was reminded of my visit to the Titan Missle Museum just south of Tucson, AZ, USA -  Jan 2003. During that visit (Completely open to public - $6) our guide noted that the 100 foot missle in the silo was once armed with a 9 Megaton nuclear warhead (600x more powerful than each bomb dropped on Japan). There were about 50 Titans in silos back then, now all concreted (Except the museum) over due to newer technology (oh sorry - weapons of mass destruction).  As I looked down the silo for the first time and saw the missle there with my own eyes, my opinion of mankind instantly went in the toilet.

What sort of idiocy would lead a society to create such large and so many WMD? A few for preventative measures (Of smaller size)- ok. Enough to blow up the world dozens of times? Lunacy.  Later I found out the Russians tested a 50 Megaton bomb (Look it up).  Of course today, we don't build them as large, but there are a heck of a lot more in total and coverage (submarines) and more dangerous (MIRVs).  Watching this video at times made me ashamed to even call myself a human.  We are just self-glorifying apes aren't we? Prone to mass hysteria, fear, greed via the military -industrial complex, and riding the wave of inertia I suppose. Stock markets, genocides, and fads come to mind.

Having been born in the 1970s I personally could not identify with the hilarious duck and cover scenes.  I still can't get the turtles out of my head.  I grew up in a generation where our idea of nuclear war is Terminator and T2 and an occassional TV special on a nuclear holocaust.

Since early 2003 I have seen the destruction caused (And rebuilding) in Hiroshima, Japan, the Los Alamos Museum, and have driven across New Mexico - passing near Trinity. Also the Int'l Spy Museum in WA DC which has a section on nuclear espionage. Next up - the Nevada Test Site! [...] is a good site.

This video is a wonderful insight into the mindset back then. I wonder how many thought - maybe I wouldn't want to be alive. So much thought on fallout shelters. Why bother? Party till you drop! The video was actually too ""painful"" to watch after 30 minutes - I had to stop and watch the rest later. An odd combination of humor and sadness.  The Atomic Cafe is much better than over-rated Radio Bikini. Some scenes in Atomic Cafe are duplicated in Radio Bikini too.

The funny thing is, with all the ignorance (Of existing nuclear weapons in existence), fear-mongering, talk of WMD prevention despite huge existing stockpiles of our own, use of new 20k pound convential bombs, paranoia, etc, it makes me wonder how much farther we actually have (or haven't) come since the 50s and 60s.",1094688000,7,2692,4.478527607361963

The best scenes are those from the Army field tests, with the soldiers dutifully being exposed to the blast, and marching in towards the fireball - really freaky stuff.  It all reminds me of the monthly Air Raid Siren tests... it was really eeiry - in the 60's, the tests would go off every 1st Tuesday of the month at 12:00 noon.  I'd stand on the upper terrace of our hilltop-located school, and listen to all the Air Raid Sirens winding up and down all over San Diego (there was one outside every school and every fire station - really LOUD, 35' tall, yellow SOBs they were)... whenever they had a test, you couldn't help but think; now would be the PERFECT time for the Russians to ATTACK!  But, it was all BS anyway - if they did attack, San Diego County and all the Aircraft Carriers and Military Bases would have been VAPORIZED!

506894,4,6302703786,"With a clever montage of 1940s/1950s news clips and Civil Defense and military training films overlaid with off-beat contemporary songs about The Bomb, the creators of THE ATOMIC CAFE produced a film that will amaze the post-Cold War generation and cause those who lived during that period to ask, ""Could that be us?""
This docu-drama begins with the Trinity atomic test blast in New Mexico in 1945, then proceeds through the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the subsequent atomic test at Bikini atoll. With the acquisition of the A-bomb by the Soviets in 1949 - my birth year - and the Korean War, the film gets into the meat of the piece, which is a visual commentary on the paranoia about the Red Menace and Nuclear Armageddon which gripped the United States during Eisenhower's two terms as President.
THE ATOMIC CAFE is alternately funny, sobering, and shocking. Funny, as when Kruschev and Nixon verbally joust in a comedic Tricky Dick and Nicky routine during the former's visit to the States. And the training films depicting citizens, singly and in large groups, on the streets and in schools, doing the ""duck and cover"" drill in response to the hypothetical Big One. Sobering, as when a priest discusses the merits of excluding non-family members from your personal bomb shelter. (In a departure from Christian charity, he was all for it.) Or the message given to Army troops assigned to the near vicinity of test explosions, which was that in a real atomic war it would be the blast that kills them, not the radiation. And shocking, as when we see the disfiguring burns and blisters affecting the residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the pigs exposed to subsequent test detonations in the desert Southwest. (My wife, an animal lover, left in horror after seeing the latter.)
Released in 1982, THE ATOMIC CAFE is a pacifist and anti-war statement produced, I suspect, in response to President Reagan's confrontational stance vis-a-vis the Evil Empire after his 1980 election. While the film inspires many different emotions, its consistent and overall tone is to mock the U.S. government for the nuclear fix it got the country into with the development of the A and H-bombs, the wild-eyed propaganda it disseminated to rally the citizenry against the Commie Hordes, and the Best Face the Civil Defense authorities put forward on the possibility of surviving a nuclear holocaust.
As a child of the 50s, I also remember the periodic tests of the air raid siren, and the ""duck and cover"" exercises. My Dad built us an elaborate bomb shelter under the garage around the time of the Cuban Crisis. While I found THE ATOMIC CAFE fascinating, it certainly wasn't balanced. (For example, the narrative tellingly ends prior to Kennedy's election. Bay of Pigs and nuclear brinkmanship? Say what?) I would also like to have seen some of the equivalent anti-American propaganda the Soviets disseminated to their citizens during the period. Perhaps, best of all, the film would be better produced today after decades' distance from the events.",1067126400,20,3059,4.9765625

506966,4,6302703786,"The Atomic Cafe is a cult classic Cold War documentary, focusing on the development and deployment of nuclear weapons from the perspective of the U.S. in 1982. Some of the footage of nuclear detonations is breath-taking, especially when placed into the perspective of the time.
The Atomic Cafe does a masterful job of weaving together news reports, government information films, public service announcements and dramas from World War II right up through the Cold War of 1982. It's interesting to watch the sometimes frightening, sometimes naive and sometimes even humorous moments that illustrate the American culture adapting to a world in which it had the ultimate destructive power (the atomic bomb), then lost the edge over the menacing Soviet Union, then developed an even more powerful weapon (the hydrogren bomb) and then saw the Soviets catch up yet again.
Some of the moments in the documentary are just classic, thanks to great footage but even more, awesome editing. For instance, one part shows a man looking at a newspaper and he says ""well, at least we don't have to worry.  We're the ones with the bomb!"" Then there is a cut to someone stating that the Soviets now have the bomb.
Then there is the naivety: Another part shows an Army officer briefing a company of soldiers who will be deployed into a nuclear area shortly after a test detonation. He tells them that there is this ""new"" threat called ""radiation"", but that they won't have to worry about it too much. They then show these soldiers in their trenches immediately after the detonation and they stand up to see, while radioactive dirt and debris whooshes over them. A news reporter asks one of the soldiers: ""Did you close your mouth?"" The soldier answers, laughing: ""No, I got a mouthful!""
If anything, the Atomic Cafe is a stark reminder of where we've been. It'll definitely be something interesting for my children to watch someday.",1020297600,39,1912,4.901234567901234
506967,4,6302703786,"Before Peter Kuran and his special effects magic on old atomic films, there was ""The Atomic Caf.""  It's a psuedo-documentary (it's all pieces of old Civil Defense, nuclear testing, and government films cobbled together, with some newsreel footage to boot) by Jayne Loader and Kevin Rafferty (George W. Bush's cousin, who later added his talents to a little production called ""Roger and Me."")  The humor is dark (and funny) only in retrospect, as ""The Atomic Caf"" explores some of the most insidious and stupid moments of the cold war.
It starts with the Manhattan Project and the effects of the Bomb on Japan, and segues right into the Rosenberg's trial and the insanity of McCarthyism.  Next, you have the famous ""duck and cover"" films along with lesser-known civil defense stuff, including fallout shelter plans and so forth.  There is little narration, and what you hear, comes from the Rosenberg's testimony, army technicians explaining how radiation can be avoided (yeah, right) and the viewer's own common sense, saying, ""man, we really believed this hogwash once, and it helped us sleep better at night.""
This new DVD presentation gives us the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, with a two-channel stereo soundtrack.  The print is decent, but as none of these old films were restored before compilation, there is grain and color loss throughout, but it's a problem with the source material, not the DVD itself (this is how Atomic Caf was supposed to look).  The sound is the biggest disappointment: Kuran was kind enough to give his Atomic films a dynamic 5.1 DD soundtrack, and Atomic Caf sounds more like a radio broadcast than a DVD.  Plus, there are zero extras to speak of.  Normally, extras do not make a DVD (how many times are you going to watch them, anyway?) but this is one of those times when an interview, or a commentary track, or even a movie trailer, would have been nice.
All in all: worth the price, especially to an Atomic collector.  This film belongs on the shelf of any serious nuke-film aficionado, and this DVD will probably be the best version we're going to see.",1019692800,47,2102,4.832869080779944
506968,5,6302703786,"""The Atomic Cafe"" is an example of Eisenstein's notion of montage on the macro level. Produced and directed by Jayne Loader, Kevin Rafferty and Pierce Rafferty, this film achieves it rhetorical potency simply by editing together old film and documentaries from the 1940's and 1950's. By putting a cartoon of Tommy the Turtle teaching school children to ""Duck and cover"" next to film of actual atomic bomb tests, ""The Atomic Cafe"" renders the Cold War both ludicrous and chilling at the same time. Without narration and by using a few choice songs, this documentary finds a surprising strong voice against the insanity of nuclear destruction.
It is important to remember that by the end of the 1950's, and for quite some time after that, it was assumed that one day there would be World War III and that it was going to be an all-out nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. ... The manner in which Americans cheerfully prepared for a nuclear war cannot help but seem patently absurd to us today, but these images are unforgettable. Still, you have to admire the spirit of American inventiveness that would come up with radiation suits and quickie shelters.
""The Atomic Cafe"" manages to inform us about the mentality of the American people during that period of the Cold War, while harshly critiquing that view from our informed perspective of today. I have always been impressed by how this could be achieved simply by arranging the order in which we view these historic bits of film and adding a dramatic counterpoint through the use of music. Very simple but quite powerful. Final Note: be prepared for Hugh Beaumont (a.k.a. Ward Cleaver) to show up in a military training film to explain what happens when an atomic bomb goes off.",1016841600,7,1752,4.823920265780731

For anyone out there who says the truth of history, or of anything for that matter, does not matter to them, then please send me your address and the make and color of your car.  You are the perfect target for a robbery as you aparently careless about anything enough to want to know about it.....oh yeah...of course your car is more important than knowing your history isn't it?
Anyway, terrific video, great documentary...perfect work in my opinion...anything that gets right into the facts with both eyes wide open is perfect.",1011916800,5,1684,4.789655172413793
506973,4,6302703786,"This review is directed primarily to the under 30's who are still trying to figure out the boomer generation. As one savvy reviewer here surmised, this film goes a long way into explaining the psychological behavior of boomers who actually were instructed by well-meaning nuns (in my case)or other elementary and high school teachers to practice ducking beneath their desks in the event of a nuclear strike. As the wit, Dave Barry, points out, the stucture of wood and minimal steel was no doubt designed as a carefully-constructed safeguard against nuclear annihilation by the brain trust that was guiding the civil defense system of the era. Other such gross anomalies are addressed in this film.
In this case, the idea of looking back provides some comic relief, but I for one, can tell you, that when the sirens were going off every other day back in 1962-63, we didn't regard it as all that funny. Read the Amazon reviewer's take above, then invest some money in purchasing this film. It is a great document that depicts a serious subject in a lighthearted manner, yet the underlying message is timeless. It should come shipped with the caveat: ""Lest we forget.""",976579200,61,1167,4.869346733668341
7830547,5,6302703786,"The use of original archival footage is brilliant. The final sequence is a masterpiece, cutting between the story the public was being told vs the reality of what these weapons are capable of. People think we're not still on the knife edge of nuclear obliteration any more, but that's just not true.",1525132800,,299,4.769230769230769

This edition came to me in perfect condition, as ordered, and on time. :-)",1520208000,,329,4.672413793103448
7830549,4,6302703786,Pretty good documentary showing clips from old government propaganda films from the 40's and 50's. I would recommend getting the the standard DVD over the collector's edition version as the 2nd disc with the propaganda are not worth the extra $13 and the DVDs will get scratched up from sliding around inside the paper sleeves.,1515888000,,327,4.963636363636364

7830552,4,6302703786,"Good historical documentary of the first 15 years of the Atomic Age, 1945-1960, with archival historical films from various sources, both military and civilian, with television broadcasts and the famous ""Duck and Cover"" school films of the mid-1950s. Shockingly shows the original 16mm color film footage of the Atomic Bomb blast test in Nevada in 1954 in which dozens of U.S. Army soldiers were exposed to nuclear radiation to study its effects on them. Also noteworthy for contemporary pop music tunes with atomic age themes on the soundtrack. Originally when this movie was released in 1982, there was a soundtrack album on LP and CD available on Rounder Records, now out of print, with all the songs on it.",1506643200,,710,4.974789915966387
