3665624,5,B001KETUHO,"As I sit in my living room listening to this DVD, I can't help but to wonder about Salsa music as I truly came to love it.  I grew up in San Juan, PR, and came to age in the late 70s idolizing the Fania aLL Stars.  This DVD brought goosebumps and tears to my eyes as I reminisce of times gone by.  It was a special treat to watch the Fania All Stars at their prime, Pacheco, Lavoe, Celia, Cheo, Barreto, Roena, etc...  If you are an old ""Salsero"" like I am, you'd understand.  The sound is exceptional and the video is great.  Buy it NOW... Viva la Fania!",1072828800,,555,4.0

3665627,5,B001KETUHO,"this message is for Sergi,  This concert is great because of both Celia Cruz and the Fania All Stars.  You may be blind or deaf not to like Fania All Stars, the best of the best in terms of salsa performers.  Is the dreamteam of salsa. Please instruct yourself a little more and don't be ignorant. About the dvd it does not get any better than this in terms of rythms and SABOR.
You can't stay still one second without dancing.  Just check all the people out of their seats dancing to every song with the best solos in the world.  Run and buy it, the video for a concert dated in the '70 s is very good.",1063238400,,603,4.076271186440678

3665629,5,B001KETUHO,"This DVD is spectacular in every way!!  It definetly shows an extremely talented group that was at least 20 years ahead of thier time musically.  The Fania All-Stars lead by Johnny Pacheco had such a great impact on the formation of all of todays music.  Thier new ideas were so innovative for thier time.  It's definetly a gift to be able not only to hear thier music but to see them in action.  This DVD will have you searching for more information about them and you'll wish that you could've seen them live.  All of the performers are outstanding to include Roberto Roena (Bongos), Nicky Marrero (Timbales), Ray Barreto (Congas), and many others.  They show that they are the best of the best.  From start to finish the performance is very entertaining.  Johnny Pacheco showed that he was the world's best flute player of that era.  Hector Lavoe and Ismael Miranda sang with thier youthful voices.  Celia Cruz performs in the first two songs.  Overall it is history that must be seen by any salsa fan.  It can also be considered an important historical document.  Fania All-Stars in Africa... You must see it to believ",1045872000,,1122,4.687179487179487
3665630,5,B001KETUHO,"Muy bueno, para los conocedores de la verdadera musica de fania soy de Puerto Rico y me crie con esta musica, deben de realizar mas conciertos de este tipo en DVD. Bueno a los consumidores deben entender que las imagenes fueros grabadas en un sistema de grabacion antiguo y no con tecnologia moderna eso es FANIA, musica en vivo, es la escencia, maestros de la musica de verdad buena inversion. Espero graben mas de este tipo de DVD.",1045785600,,433,4.564102564102564
3665631,1,B001KETUHO,"Bad quality of image and of sound. Only 8 tracks, and only 2 with Celia Cruz. The band plays and sings out of tune almost all the time. The camera don't know who is doing the solo in every moment, so you lose a lot of solos information. Celia is great but only 2 tracks with her. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO ANYBODY!!, althoug I have a lot of Celia Cruz CD's and I love them!",1043712000,,377,3.909090909090909
3665632,5,B001KETUHO,"Excelente imagen y excelente sonido. Grabado en 1974, en el festival musical organizado para la pelea de Ali-Foreman, en Kinshasa, Zaire. Lo unico malo es que solo sean 8 track y 54 minutos. Debi haber sido mas extenso. Ojal hayan mas conciertos de la Fania All Stars como este disponibles en DVD. Se puede apreciar en vivo a musicos como Boby Valentin en un solo en En Orbita, Ray Barreto en solo de congas junto con el sensacional baile de Roberto Roena en Ponte Duro, Larry Harlow, Nicky Marrero, Yomo Toro, Ismael Quintana, Ismael Miranda, Hector Lavoe, Santos Colon, Cheo Feliciano,  y por supuesto Celia Cruz. Tambien Luis ""Perico"" Ortiz. Es una joya y si amas la msica latina es un ""must have"".",1043539200,,701,4.699186991869919
3665633,5,B001KETUHO,"You will absolutely love this concert on DVD. I was so surprised that the video quality and sound were so good. Unbelievable to see Hector LaVoe, Ismael Miranda, Bobby Valentin, Johnny Pacheco, Roberto Roena, Larry Harlow, Cheo Feliciano, Ismael Quintana, and others at the top of their form. Man, it was very emotional for me to see these legends in action, before they actually became legendary. You must have this DVD.",1031097600,,421,4.943661971830986

8314871,5,B001KETUHO,"Amazing video of one of the earlier All-Star groups. Every second of this film is crackling with energy. These people are having fun!! The film is shot with several hand-held cameras and much attention is payed to the rhythm section. With little to no screen time for the horn players or audience.

My DVD has no extras and no choice of audio (I think it's 5.1?)

Celia is only on the first two songs:

With Celia Cruz:
Kimbala
Guantanamera

Without Celia:
En Orbita
El Raton
Me Gente
Guantanamera
Ponte Duro
Fania Theme/Closing credits

The Line up (to the extent it is listed in the film. Notice there are no horn players listed, and there is at least one percussionist and one violin player not on this list.:
Johnny Pacheco - Director and Flute
Celia Cruz - voice
Santos Colon - voice
Cheo Feliciano - voice
Larry Harlow - piano
Felix 'Pupi' Legarreta - violin
Hector Lavoe - voice

Yomo Toro - cuatro
Bobby Valentin - bass

I found this text elsewhere on the 'net:

In 1974 Celia Cruz & The Fania All Stars were invited to take part in a 3-day festival in celebration of black sports and entertainment in Kinshasa, Zaire. Their original performance on the first day caused such a hysterical response from the audience that they were invited back two days later for an encore performance. The concert was part of the famous Rumble in the Jungle title fight between the reigning champion George Foreman and the greatest, Muhammad Ali. Their phenomenal performance to an audience of 80,000 people at the Stadu du Hai was shot in 35mm on sic camaras by director Leon Gast (who won an Academy Award for When We Were Kings.) Featuring Johnny Pacheco, Cheo Felicano, Hector Lavoe and Roberto Roena.",1258675200,,1834,4.694704049844237
8314872,2,B001KETUHO,Celia Cruz sings the first two songs and you never see her again. Buy this if you want to see Johnny Pacheco in action. There are very long yet undeniably good jamming sessions...I got bored during a few of these...,1182556800,,215,4.4
8314873,4,B001KETUHO,"Well if you are looking for alot of footage of Celia you will be disapoited,Johnny Pachecco is one hell of a player and band leader! I did not know alot about him til this DVD.",1180656000,,176,4.057142857142857

8314875,1,B001KETUHO,"Don't buy this CUT 54 min version.  Save your money ..... look for and buy the 74 min version that includes the musicians and all the ""goings on"" backstage!  WELL WORTH IT.... MUCH BETTER THAN THIS VERSION.",1156550400,,206,4.54054054054054
8314876,5,B001KETUHO,"I have to admit, we'll never ever see such magnitude of celebration like this again. Salsa music has changed over the past two decades and nothing will ever come as close to being salsa style than what is captivated on this marvelously made DVD. Flaws made were intelligently reverted and marvelously conducted by none other than the great flutista Johnny and what a great job he did, as well as his companions in the band! All were marvelous in this concert. Their studio music is much like their live performances. I absolutely adored each and every one of them since my youth (Celia, Johnny, Santos, Ray Barreto, Lavoe, and more).  Brilliantly done. I wish to see salsa like this .. blazing and hot with poetic lyrics that are not harsh and offensive. Thanks to the executors who put this package together for us lovers of salsa!! Bravo!!!",1112227200,,842,4.727891156462585
8314877,3,B001KETUHO,"I'm a huge salsa fan and this dvd is a must see for any old school fan. However I don't think this is a must buy at the price of $17. The dvd is poorly produced without even a main menu or any special features (not even a plug for other fania music).  the dvd only includes 6 songs, one of those in two versions for a total of 7 for a total running time of 53 min. I love watching Hector Lavoe singing ""Mi Gente"" trying to dance and wearing a green shirt and red pants. All performers were the tops in their field and most continue to be close to the top today (20 yrs later!) even if they stopped performing. Bottom line, if price isn't an issue buy this. Otherwise, rent it or ask a friend for a copy before you decide to purchase it.",1086652800,,736,3.972972972972973
