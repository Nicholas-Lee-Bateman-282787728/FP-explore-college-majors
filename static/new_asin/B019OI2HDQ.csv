Not a burden I want engraved into my 5 year old daughter.  I have a degree in Graphic Design, I had courses in Marketing.  Subliminal messages are REAL!

7578606,5,B019OI2HDQ,"Mermaids are always a great choice!

My youngest son, 7yr.s, absolutely loved this movie! He loved that they changed into different types of merpeople while still looking like themselves.
My eldest son, 12yr.s, thought this was one of the best films they have made. They showed how being an outcast, and feeling totally alone, can hurt someone. He really identified with this one because he's been a victim of bullying, and he loved how everyone was able to be friends at the end... after people took the time to learn another's story.",1476403200,2,535,4.815217391304348

7578612,4,B019OI2HDQ,"This was a fun movie, but I don't think it was one of the better Monster High movies, like Freaky Fusion or 13 Wishes. It's about Lagoona needing to face her fears (of performing in front of people). The ghouls turn into sealife, which is amusing seeing them learn to use their new appendage(s). Draculara became an octopus (maybe a squid). Gil became a manta ray. Frankie became an eel (electric eel- get it?). And so on. Lagoona is funny when she panics because she makes a goofy face and freezes when she realizes people are watching her dance. Toralei called her a ""frozen fishstick"". It's pretty funny, and great for Monster High fans. It's not one of my favorites, for sure, but it's a good movie for Monster High fans.",1474588800,2,725,4.541984732824427

7578690,5,B019OI2HDQ,"I love the monster high movies and so do my kids. My daughter used her birthday money to buy this and was very excited to see it! They have some new ghoul friends who get pulled deep into the sea to help Lagoona Blue face her fears and concur her stage fright. She must face up to her childhood friend turned enemy, Kala Mer'ri, and prove to her that she can get over her fears and dance in front of everyone. They later find out that Kala was jealous of Lagoona and her family because most others made fun of her dad, The Kraken, because of his appearance. Just as with most other monster high movies, this one has a great lesson and teaches kids to look past their ""freaky flaws"" and to accept each other for who they are.

This movie is not rated, but does have a few scary scenes that may not be suitable for younger audiences. My four year old thought it was a little creepy when they went to face the kraken, but nothing nightmare worthy. If your child is easily frightened, this movie may not be for them.",1461024000,2,1012,4.216494845360825

7578694,5,B019OI2HDQ,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my 7 year old niece.  I just know she's going to love it.  We've already seen this movie at my other niece's house and all of the kids in the family (including the boys ages 6,7, and 11) really enjoyed this movie as well.  My whole family really enjoys watching the Monster High movies and shows.  I think the lessons that Monster High teaches are just put in terms kids can really understand and I think they're GREAT for kids of all ages!  This movie's lesson is basically that you really shouldn't pick on people because you never know what they're feeling/thinking/experiencing.  It's about a monster who has stage fright because of something that happened to her when she was younger and she needs to overcome that fear in order to save her friends.  It's a really cool movie for the whole family to watch, honestly.  Super cute!",1460419200,,871,4.538461538461538

The only downside of the DVD is that in the previews, it includes the new cute, preschool ""how do you boo"" reboot that Mattel is going for.",1458604800,,375,4.529411764705882

7578720,4,B019OI2HDQ,"I liked Boo York. It took MH into a new musical direction that seemed fun. Going back to the old story formula made me really worried the franchise would burn out, but it didn't. I'm happy to say MH HAUNTED is in my option still the worst of the movies yet, and even though I t share the the idea of the Ghouls all changing into the same kind of Monster ( fish instead of ghosts) this was great. The clunky ""crush""  story that buried HAUNTED ( pun intended ) was totally left out and gives a fun adventure.

One part of Boo York was of course the pop songs that went along with the story. Scarrier Reef had the songs in the background much more like a traditional MH story. It was a good  choice but I couldn't help noticing the singer is the same from Boo York that was used over and over and over again. I have commented on other Mattle projects that will skip quality and reuse material, to save on cost, but this time it was bad! After making a musical that prominently featured such few artists using them again was painful to listen to.

Th e best part of Scarrier Reef is by far the visuals. It's not on par with Finding Nemo in water effect, but dose a fun job of using the colors of the ocean and the neon effects of some fish. The ghouls underwater dance was amazing.

Over all this is a fine addition to the MH library of movies. I would easily have given it five stars but for a little tease that i think fans were hopping for. The end  credit scene in Boo Yoo was Astra  Nova on her Icoffin taking to Raven and Apple from Mattel's second high school series Ever After High. Leaving a tease for a possible crossover story. In the most recent EAH movie Dragon Games a character breaks the fourth wall and remarks "" Who ever heard of a Monster High?""  I warned you it would get geekie. Now, these two references to one another aren't the only crossover Easter eggs.  The character CA Cupid started in MH and has a webepisode of her at her new school EAH. I just dislike that dispite the fact that the two worlds exist they drop little references to each other that are just fan service. ""Oh, look a Monster High reference! Ha Ha!"" Instead of a real trail of end credit scenes that could lead to the two meeting. Just a ranting fan who wants more of both together you can call me.

Scarrier Reef five star MH movie with just few freaky flaws that you might notice.",1458172800,5,2373,4.20704845814978
