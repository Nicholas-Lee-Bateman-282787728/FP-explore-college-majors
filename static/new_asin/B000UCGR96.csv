8212884,3,B000UCGR96,Not what I expected. I wanted to see more of the original film,1424304000,,62,3.8461538461538463
8212885,4,B000UCGR96,Very Happy with the dvd . My VHS copy wore out years ago.....Nice to have a replacement on DVD,1404691200,,94,4.0
8212886,3,B000UCGR96,I remember seeing this video on VHS before and I enjoy it each time I see it.  Nice to own this classic footage of these groups performing on 'Shindig' and 'Hullabaloo.'  The images were clear and I was glad to have this on dvd but the quality seems very much homemade as if someone copied this on their own at home and just started selling copies.  The dvd cover images match the book cover nicely but seem like they were downloaded from a computer or copy machine.  Decent quality but just seems a bit low budget.,1383177600,,515,4.333333333333333
8212887,5,B000UCGR96,This was for my wife who watched this with her mom when it came out a long time ago. Made her very happy.,1358294400,,105,3.608695652173913
8212888,5,B000UCGR96,"I owned this documentary years ago on VHS, and actually had it in DVD before but it got lost in a loan.  What makes this film great for me is the interviews with some of the principals from that time.  There's no way to cover all the women who gave us all such enjoyment back then, but there is a great sampling of them.  The tragedy of that time of the 'Brill Building Sound' is that so many of the young women, particularly the black women, saw so little financial gain from their work.  As was stated at least once in the documentary, often the record producers owned the names to the groups, and they would simply move girls in and out of them.  It was quite easy because, other than the Shirelles and the Supremes, and maybe the Vandellas, white people certainly didn't know any of the members anyway!  Regardless, that time gave us amazing, fun music, only magnifying the sad state of songwriting and music production now.  I'm delighted to have been a kid in that time, and very satisfied with this effort to document it.",1345334400,,1028,4.4361702127659575
8212889,4,B000UCGR96,"GIRL GROUPS: THE STORY OF A SOUND DVD is a 1983 documentary that's based on a book by the same title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girl-Groups-The-Story-of-a-Sound/dp/0933328257/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girl Groups: The Story of a Sound</a>&nbsp;by Alan Betrock.

It charts the rise and fall of 60s girl group sound that actually started in the 1950s and has interviews with many of the people who were in front of and behind the scenes.

You'll see interviews with songwriters Ellie Greenwich,  Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, and rock producer Don Kirshner who were responsible for some of the biggest songs, concerts and rock acts that defined 1960s rock and roll. And you'll also get interviews with Arlene Smith (lead singer of ""The Chantels""), Darlene Love (lead singer of ""The Blossoms,"" ""Bob B. Soxx & The Blue Jeans,"" among others), Ronnie Spector (lead singer of ""The Ronettes""), and Mary Wilson (backup singer of ""The Supremes"").

The documentary charts the beginning of the girl group sound and its evolution by showing fantastic clips of performances by The Angels, The Shangri-Las, The Exciters, The Ronettes, Mary Wells, The Supremes, The Blossoms, Martha & The Vandellas, The Dixie Cups, The Shirelles, The Marvelettes, Dee Dee Sharp, Little Eva, and Frankie Lymon -- who actually influenced many of the girl singers with his sound. Mostly all of these performances are live from various television shows from back then, but the quality is slightly below average.

You also get to see the inside of the Gold Star Recording Studios where Phil Spector produced his many hits with the ""wall of sound."" And you'll get to see home footage that looks about the mid to late 60s, of parties where teens are dancing to the music, and of people shopping inside a record store! Truly priceless!

Although the quality is OK and won't detract from viewing pleasure, the documentary could really stand a total remastering. Although this might be impossible considering that many of the performance and other footage came from different sources and probably no longer exist, but there is scratches and surface dirt and some of the footage is a little blurry, but not too bad and it's not too distracting, considering what rare gems these performances are.

And since this documentary was made sometime in 1983 (going by the copyright date) it only touches the surface on some of the more popular controversies that came to light after this date. Ronnie Spector talks about her marriage to Phil Spector and how he started to become controlling and manipulative after they got married and basically shut her off from the rest of the world. We all know what happens to Phil Spector in 2000s. And Mary Wilson discusses the breakup of the Supremes and how she and Florence Ballard where placed in the background as Berry Gordy focused his attention on Diana Ross, to Florence eventually quitting the group, and finally her death. In hindsight, the Wilson interview is pretty portent because while talking about being at Ballard's funeral service and the media circus that was going on, she recounts that at the actual cemetery, no one was there and she finally had a chance to be alone with Flo and she says, ""Don't worry Flo, I'll take care of it."" Of course, three years later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamgirl-and-Supreme-Faith-My-Life-as-a-Supreme/dp/081541000X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamgirl and Supreme Faith: My Life as a Supreme</a>&nbsp;would hit bookstores, become the best-selling rock bio of all time, and blow the lid off and expose the problems of one the most successful girl groups in history, not to mention the Motown machine.

It also briefly talks about the ""British Invasion"" and how that made it very difficult for many of the American rock groups to survive.

Anyway, hopefully one day some company will come along (like Shout Factory! that does a lot of old TV shows and remasters them for DVD) and try and clean this documentary up and re-release it. It is a fascinating look at a part of American music history that cannot and should not be forgotten. If you can find the DVD, and it's reasonably priced, I would definitely buy it especially if you're a big fan of 60s music and of girl groups.

Here's a listing of the performances:

The Angels: ""My Boyfriend's Back""

Frankie Lymon: ""Why Do Fools Fall In Love?""

The Chantels: ""Maybe""

Dee Dee Sharp: ""Mashed Potatoes""

The Shirelles: ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?""

Little Eva: ""Locomotion""

The Dixie Cups: ""Chapel Of Love,"" ""You Should Have Seen The Way He Looked At Me""

The Exciters ""Tell Him"" music video of them singing to a grizzly bear at the zoo.

Martha & The Vandellas: ""Dancin' In The Street"" portions of this clip show them at a Detroit auto plant going down the assembly line, LOL.

Mary Wells: ""My Guy""

The Marvelettes: ""Mr. Postman""

The Shangri-Las: ""Remember (Walkin' In The Sand),"" ""Give Him A Great Big Kiss,"" and ""Leader Of The Pack""

The Ronettes: ""Shout"" from the BIG TNT SHOW, and ""Be My Baby""

Darlene Love: ""Today I Met The Boy I'm Going To Marry"" live performance from the 70s or 80s. ""He's A Rebel"" shown over clips of a juvenile delinquent perhaps clips from a teen pulp film.

The Blossoms: ""Needle In A Haystack""

The Supremes: ""Come See About Me,"" ""Baby Love,"" ""Stop In The Name Of Love,"" ""Back In My Arms Again,"" and ""Someday We'll Be Together"" - this song sounds like an alternate take and plays over other clips.",1321574400,4,5530,5.082872928176796
8212890,3,B000UCGR96,"The documentary itself is excellent, a mix of seldom-seen archival footage and early-1980s interviews with the artists, composers and producers. (Watch for the eerily prescient comments about Phil Spector, recorded 25 years before his murder conviction. Ellie Greenwich: ""Was he brilliant? Yes. Was he frightening? Yes. Was he crazy...?"")

If only the quality were better. Of course you don't expect perfection in newsreel and kinescope/videotape footage from the early sixties... but even the eighties-vintage interviews look like dubs from VHS. In fact, my laserdisc copy of this title is equal to or better than the DVD.

But with all that said... by the time you're ten minutes into the show, you'll have forgotten about the grainy picture and will just sit back and revel in the wonderful music. Warts and all, this disc is definitely worth owning for anyone who loves this genre.",1252627200,,885,5.181818181818182
8212891,5,B000UCGR96,"Though the video quality is not the absolute best, the music is concise and clear. The story, shows the gossip and production routes of girl groups of the 1950' and 1960's.  The music is something to be cherished. The story are good and will wet your appetite for more information.",1250985600,,281,4.62
8212892,5,B000UCGR96,"This is the DVD exact counterpart of the VHS tape of the same name, but is remarkably clean and clear...for material of this type, both the picture and sound are of excellent quality.  If you are familiar with the VHS I am sure you will want this; if you are not familiar with the VHS but love the REAL THING GIRL GROUP, which only exists in the sixties, then you are in for a fantastic boon: Angels, Ronettes, Exciters, Supremes, Dixie Cups, Martha and Vandellas, Shangri-Las, Marvelettes, Shirelles, more... and some very excellent commentary of the phenom by the original players.  PRICELESS!!",1203638400,9,596,4.833333333333333
