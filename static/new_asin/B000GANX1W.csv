2603977,3,B000GANX1W,"We had just watched Man Hunt (1941) with Walter Pidgeon & Joan Bennett, director Fritz Lang's first US film.  I sat on the edge of my seat the whole time.  It was based on the same book as Rogue Male (197?) was.  Man Hunt was beautifully done and in B&W.  Rogue Male was a BBC production and was poorly done which surprised me.  It also was in color.  I almost went to sleep in parts of it.  I don't recommend it. Get Man Hunt instead which incidentally came out a few months before Britain declared war on Germany. It was very timely.",1443571200,,535,4.186274509803922

2603981,5,B000GANX1W,"I first saw this magnificent film years ago. The acting story and plot simply blew me away it was that good. I sat and watched it throughout with no distractions nor breaks. Peter O'Toole is magnificent as the Upper Class hero who seeks revenge for his fiance's cruel death due to the Nazis.
 His revenge? To assassinate Hitler.
 As we all know he didn't succeed and here the story sets off on a cracking pace.
Tortured by the Nazis (I won't give details!)
He escapes and thanks to a WW1 German ex POW who respected the British he gets back to England.

 But here the plot twist even further, Britain is not at war with the Germans you see the Aristo's have more German cousins that Queen Victoria.

So he is on his own!
Soon framed he goes on the run. The Nazis seek to kill our hero so he goes to ground in England. Now imagine hiding yourself in rural England so no one knows you are there?
 A top English Lord/ Nazi agent is set to find him and does so. Here I won't spoil the plot but I was in tears at one incident!! And cheered at another.
This is the only film that I have seen that is better than the Geoffrey Household book.
 O'Toole is simply magnificent and I believe this to be better than his Lawrence portrayal (some praise indeed).
The ending on the film comes with regret that such a great film could go on for longer rather than some of today's offerings where the finish is a relief.

I guarantee you will enjoy this film and it will stay with you a long time.

Worth a chance? Yes.",1424044800,,1501,4.22027972027972

As for content, there is a lot to enjoy.  The plot is compelling, the script is excellent, the directing is excellent, the acting performances by everyone involved are excellent (Peter O'Toole stars; cameo appearance by playwright Harold Pinter), the score is original and magnificent (reminiscent of Elgar).

2603998,4,B000GANX1W,"I've actually got a couple of copies of this. It is a good, solid, unconventional cat-and-mouse story about an English gentleman, Sir Robert Hunter, (O'Toole) who takes a shot at Hitler in 1939, is captured, tortured and escapes back to England, where he is hunted by a Nazi agent.

This film features strong performances all around, including a wonderful performance by Alister Simm (famous for his portrayal of Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol"") in his final screen appearance. Simm, who plays Sir Robert's uncle, is a wonderfully quirky, charming government official, who says things like, ""I'm a member of the government. How should I know what people should do?""

Originally made for British television in the mid-1970s, I have never seen a DVD version of this which is based on a really good video transfer, including this one. There are various copies of this kicking around with different running times. Get the one with the longest running time you can find.

The extra footage explains why Sir Robert took a shot at Hitler in a bit more detail. It has to do with a woman, of course.",1367798400,,1089,4.81283422459893
2603999,1,B000GANX1W,This is without a doubt the worst transfer of a film I have ever seen. Do NOT buy this film despite it being a good movie. I watched only a few minutes of it and the quality is shocking. I got better copies from tape to tape in the 1980's than this miserable effort. Amazon should be ashamed to sell something so substandard and unwatchable.,1363046400,,341,4.2615384615384615

In the past however, reviewers would not stop railing on the very poor audio quality ...  truly was about the worst I've heard on a fairly modern film.  But now I don't see mention of that?  Did someone manage to dig up a better copy to master from? Or did the audio benefit from some digital wizardry or what?  The copy I have is as near to unwatchable as something can get and if were not such a good film there is no way I would have suffered it more than 1/2 way through.  As I recall the copy I have does not even have close caption option which would have sincerely helped!  But is there a decent copy these days?  If so what is the sku# or ISB or whatever will clearly separate it from one of the old rotten sounding ones?

After attempting to assasinate Hitler when England was still trying to make nice with the Fuehrer, O'Toole is on his own, persona non grata with the British establishment.  The Germans come after him in England itself, and O'Toole is forced to take cover in his own land.  O'Toole is the epitome of British nobility, resourceful, sarcastic, cool as ice.  The film ending is a bit sanctimonious and slightly disappointing, with O'Toole pictured as being ready to sacrifice himself because he is so torn by the loss of his beloved.

2604013,4,B000GANX1W,"...but at $3.95, you can't miss.

OK, at times the sound is muffled, the color washes out, there's a bit of streakiness, the picture seems to shake, and it has the appearance of the usual low budget film. BUT, the movie is absolutely riveting and the flaws are minor distractions. I watched it then had to watch it again.

Not the typical commando-trained man on the run flick, as in The Bourne Identity, but a slower paced, perhaps more thoughtful type of story. Sir Robert (O'Toole)goes to ground while being pursued after failing to assassinate Hitler and being tortured then escaping. We see his determination and ingenuity (again, not the usual Hollywood sort of stunts), but also the man he is.

I did not catch on to the reason why he went after Hitler until later in the movie, so disagree with an earlier viewer. However, I've not read the book before seeing the movie. There are hints about what happened and when I realized what had occured, it increased the tension, rather than ruining the end for me.

John Standing is terrific as the pursuer, Harold Pinter has a nice scene, Alistair Sim plays the doddering uncle well, but it is Peter O'Toole who makes the movie.

O'Toole is excellent at dry humor and getting across a page of dialog with just a look. There's a wealth of both in Rogue Male.

It's a shame this movie is not better visually and does not get much notice among O'Toole's works. It is, however, a movie that will keep you guessing about what will happen and is well worth a look. In a recent interview, O'Toole said Rogue Male was his favorite movie and it is easy to see why.

For parents: Since I have kids and do not trust the ratings system (and Rogue Male is unrated), I appreciate reviews that note what might be objectionable for kids.

Rogue Male is intense at times and shows Sir Robert being tortured- blood on his face and facial expressions during 2 incidents. There's a couple other violent moments- nothing very graphic or worse than what they've seen on TV. Teens might find it a bit slow, but interesting. Not for kids under 13.",1117324800,,2074,4.556451612903226

Yesterday said dvd arrived at my place, and although I've had so far no time to watch the whole movie, I nevertheless checked the dvd with regard to quality. The result: The quality is just abonimable. The transfer seems to have been directly taken from a second or third generation (bootleg?) video cassette; the overall miserable quality not only of the picture (I've seen mpeg files that were better) but also of the sound even lets me suspect that what we hear and see on this dvd released by the ""Passion"" label is a recording of a VHS video playback (all I'm missing is someone's head suddenly appearing in front of the monitor and/or the sound of someone coughing).
