7854933,4,6303667732,Nice T & A flick.,1411689600,,17,2.6
7854934,5,6303667732,"I bought the ""NR"" version in NewYork years ago and that version is the blueprint of what an afterdark movie should look like. Directed by Jim Wynorski, who is the best and made a remake Lust Connection, Virtual Desire is a real classis and one of the best I have ever seen and I have seen most of theses movies. The ""R"" version is a waste of tape, make sure you buy the right one , check the lenth of  the movies, as the long version is the real one.",1188259200,,450,4.0
7854935,5,6303667732,"It's perfect.  There is so much quality t&a in this thing it re-defines all t&a flicks.  But make sure you get the unrated version. As some disappointed viewers lamented, the R-rated one skimps on some very good stuff.

Beautiful girls constantly getting nude and doing this guy Brad. It's almost too much for one movie.  Wall to wall nudity, the best softcore flick I have ever seen, period. Gotta love the one-liners (Michael Meyers? Really?  He even makes a horror movie reference!  Nice.)

Lorissa Mccomas,Annette Burger, Julie Strain, Gail Harris...and much more.  What a lineup.

if you find the unrated version you must buy it.

2014 update:  just watched it again (unrated). Still love it.  It's dated - big ""cell phones"" lol  and ""tapes"" but who the hell cares.  Lorissa friggin McCommas does a hetero scene in this!!  She is a goddess.  And all the other girls are beautiful too.  Somehow, they all seem to warm up to uh, ""Mr. Meyers"", and so will you (and place yourself in those shoes).  This was clearly the time of his life.  He represents mankind very well (who can blame him when you see this lineup of women? huh? really!)

This is what fun, light, at times funny but always sexy movies are supposed to be.  Overlook the flaws and appreciate what this film delivers, in spades.  Better than most everything else for its time, and better than most nowadays.

Only thing that measures up for director Wynorski after this is the Tylene Buck scene in Witches of Breastwick 2...my humble opinion!",1171584000,,1508,4.737451737451737
7854936,3,6303667732,"This movie only gets 3 stars because several of the girls in it are extremely hot.  However, the scenes are not that great.  All you ever really get is boobie shots...love the boobies but this movie could have delivered so much more.

Overall, a disappointment.",1135814400,,261,4.7555555555555555
7854937,1,6303667732,"It's not really worth it, because the version of the movie I got is edited.  They've cut cut all the good sex scenes (which is why we buy it).  I had the same thing happen to me with ""The Price of Desire"".  They want to sell more movies, so they cut it down to make it a ""R"" movie rather than ""NR"".  It is all a bunch of crap, because it's my money.

Also, I saw Massuese 3, and every scene in this movie is also in that movie.  Luckily for me, I got to see the full sex scenes in that movie.  I got this movie, because of Annette Burger.  It seems she was only in two movies, this one and Massuese 3.  I guess now I know why.  She was only in one movie really.

Find the unedited version and don't bother with this crap.",1129248000,5,721,3.836734693877551
7854938,1,6303667732,"This is not as good as the other reviewers here on amazon make it out to be. Almost every aspect of it is poor. I won't mention the plot because there isn't one. Its just some guy goofing around on a very old computer with some very bad sex scences inter cut beween shots of him typing in a stupidly large font size. For a much better erotic movie get 'Victim of Desire' instead. If you do you will notice that 'Virtual Desire' has used some scenes of Julie Strain from 'Victim' as a filler in this one. Talk about scraping the barrel. Both are by

Jim Wynorski, so I can only assume he got bored while making this and dipped into the archive. Don't bother with this: Buy Victim, not Virtual!",1105488000,2,692,4.242424242424242
7854939,5,6303667732,"what a movie.....the acting is terrible the women are very unattractive apart from tammy parks and the plot and story line is awful, thats why i loved it.  I watched the movie for the first time and laughed my head off, especially at the large fonts brad lake uses to seduce the women on line.  The acting is so funny especially when he is having sex with that blonde girl and his wife is down stairs and he goes shhhhhhhhh...I mean it makes me wonder why he cheated on his wife she is the only decent looking woman on the film. Anyways if you like cheesy movies then please buy this you won't regret it itll be an instant classic and youll be quoting lines from the film till the day you die such as, ""good game"" or ""your hotter than the fire baby"" or ""i wouldnt mind her serving my balls"" or ""there was this chick in vegas named julie she was the girlfriend of the mobster veto popadompali he practically owned the strip it was tough game messing with one of vetos girls but julie just wasn't any chick she just turned veto and his boys to the da got em a state sentence put him and his boys in the slammer and speaking of slammer thats just what i wanted to do to julie,"" ahhhhhh priceless",1047427200,,1192,4.200873362445415
7854940,5,6303667732,"After watching this film a few times on sky i realised how class it was, the story line is pretty good cause its a film about meeting women off of net and shagging them, i believe im subconciously living out this film lol, so buy it now!",972864000,2,237,4.0638297872340425
