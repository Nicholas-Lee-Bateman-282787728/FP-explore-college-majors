3167766,4,B00177YA6A,"Let go of common sense before watching.  In a drought of movies, desperate for something funny, diverting, hopefully romantic(too much to ask?), I found this surprisingly, entertaining and unknown flick in a lonely 'Red Box'.

The premise: a thirty-something, construction running, successful woman with a family history of early menopause and desperate for a baby, breaks up with her handsome, film documentary boyfriend because he's not sure he wants to go the family way.  By the magic of modern medicine, she then discovers her biological clock almost ticked out with only one more ovum/egg remaining.  Her friends devise a madcap scheme for her to either A. shack up with someone ASAP, i.e., one night standish, or B. sperm bank it.

For reasons not totally explained, she initially opts for Plan A, but then it deteriorates into whatever will get the job done, so to speak.  She pines for her ex, but he's stuck and unreachable in the Aran Islands, Ireland being pursued by his catty but sexy assistant(Ruta Gedmintas).
Whatever can go wrong goes wrong as Heather Graham's character searches out potential 'donors'.

So, it sounds like a pretty, amoral tale, and it is until the end, but there's an old fashion kind of romance going on in wolf's clothing.  The story's inane.  The idea of urgently sleeping around in order to get pregnant is frightening in reality, but the movie's a gimmick for laughs, and it is funny.

I like Heather Graham.  She usually plays in quirky, somewhat unknown movies.  There's no nudity, some language, and lots of suggestive situations which give it the R-rating.  I'd give it a 3-Star except, I love Orlando Seale who plays her gay, reluctant friend.  I remember him from a LDS made film, ""Pride and Prejudice"" which is actually pretty good.  He's a wonderful, multi-talented, Shakespearean actor with a gift for comedy.

Bottom line: a silly, English, romantic comedy that ultimately follows the romantic comedy format, all's well that ends well.  Enjoy it when you're at a lost what to watch.",1225756800,10,2034,4.970414201183432
3167767,5,B00177YA6A,"I loved Heather Graham in Austin Powers, so was really looking forward to seeing her in another film. She did not disappoint!! She does a really good job of the British accent and truly gives Renee Zellweger a run for her money on the Hollywood actress goes British. This was a really great performance and she looks great as ever. This film was way better than Baby Mama (I was not a fan). This film is definitely entertaining! Never seen someone so desperate to get pregnant before! This film is one to buy!",1225324800,5,509,4.483870967741935

3167794,2,B00177YA6A,"I feel like all post-Austin Powers Heather Graham movies are all the same - Heather Graham's character mopes about not being able to find a guy and she wants to have a baby. I'm not sure if it's coincidence of Graham's preferences, but she always seems to play a desperate woman who seems to shed any sex appeal she had with her personality. Moreover, the movie just isn't that funny. There's only so much of sad, pathetic loser one can take before it stops being funny.",1315094400,2,470,4.476744186046512

3167796,3,B00177YA6A,"Miss-conception is an odd little movie telling the tale of a woman who owns a construction company who shortly after breaking up with her man over his not wanting children finds that she only has a single egg left to have children with.

Her maternal clock on overload she goes into overtime first trying to find her man (who went to Ireland to film a documentary) and then to try to find a man, ANY man to be the right father/contributor.

As you might guess it leads to a comedy of errors and a bit of discovery for both her, her friend and her man Zack who owns the most poignant of the film in an encounter with a young nun in an Irish convent.

I don't want to give away too much of the plot, bits and pieces of it are predictable but the movie does have its moments.  Never in the history of modern film has it been so hard for an attractive woman to get laid.

It might be worthwhile as a streaming download but I don't know if its a buyer.",1273881600,3,947,4.097297297297297
3167797,4,B00177YA6A,"The movie seemed a little bit long but it was fun movie.  I rented it to watch on the treadmill for 99 cents on Amazon and it was worth it.  It was cute and the cast certainly made the movie.  It is a little silly at times and just a little bit weird, she is lucky she didn't get hurt - but you realize this is not a serious type movie just a fun show.

I wish they did more with the scenery choices.  I think you see the same dreary harbor with the crane a few times.  The jogging park is nice, though. I liked the music.

Cute, fun, something you'd watch on Lifetime Movie Networkk.",1246924800,3,584,3.9401709401709404

Nearly two decades of stress on the entire surrounding social structure as less than competent ""teachers"" pretend to ""educate"" the illiterate programmable illogic device to some semblance of humanity.  Deforming of the female body with typically permanent scarring.  Typically felonious enslavement of some male on whom is inflicted the ""duty"" to pay for the whim of the womb.  But instead of addressing the realities of ""conceiving a baby"", this film dwells on all of the potential interferences with the illogical counterproductive whim of inflicting yet more population on an overcrowded world.
