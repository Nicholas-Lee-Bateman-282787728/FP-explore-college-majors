8577681,1,B000TUKFR4,"Awful! Nuff said. Absolutely useless. Now nuff said. I only gave it one star cause I had to. I don't guess it is fair to not tell you why it is awful.
First, and foremost the audio on it I guess was sped up to mask the presenters voice.
Secondly. The quality of the disc is very poor. The first copy I recieved was unreadable. When I recieved a working copy I felt like I had been bam-boozled. The print job on it was not professional at all. Basic white frosted dvd with a nasty barely legible printing on the front that still has screen lines on it.
Back to the actual content of the dvd. The presenter bounces around the project, and has no discernible workflow which makes him very hard to follow.
I usually try to find something good to say at this point, unfortunately I don't have anything.",1224633600,,797,4.28476821192053
