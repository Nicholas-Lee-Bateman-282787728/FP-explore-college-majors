2111230,4,B0002OI4B6,"This film has developed something of a reputation as a strong low budget western, and I just wanted to say that Ambush at Tomahawk Gap deserves its rep.
This is a short, fast, and surprisingly hardboiled, little movie.  Almost every character is hard, greedy and desperate, and the story puts them into a tight spot that just gets worse, building to a violent climax that seems likely to have influenced more than one spaghetti western of fifteen years later.
I like westerns, but prefer the leaner, meaner style, which is actually pretty uncommon.  This film delivers the goods, and if you like `em tough and don't turn your nose up at films clearly made on a less than blockbuster budget, it'll probably work for you too.",1375833600,5,723,4.73015873015873

2111232,4,B0002OI4B6,"Ambush At Tomahawk Gap tells the story of four outlaws-McCord {John Hodiak}, Egan {David Bryan}, Doc {Ray Teal} & Kid {John Derek} who after being released from a five year sentence for robbery at Yuma Territorial Prison, implode from within as they yearn to find the hidden loot from their ill gotten gains. Not only that but they are in the middle of Indian territory and Apache attacks are frequent and savage in their execution.

Bloody & brutal Western programmer out of Columbia Pictures that's produced by Wallace MacDonald and directed by Fred Sears. Written by David Lang, the principal location shoot is at Corriganville, Simi Valley, California. With Technicolor enhanced cinematography coming from Henry Freulich. Tho featuring a pretty weak, and at times nutty, story, the film has a high watch-ability factor on account of its adherence to Western action staples, it helps, too, that Sears directs with an absolutely no-nonsense approach. Running at just shy of 80 minutes, it just doesn't have time to dwell on intricacies, instead choosing more to embrace that this isn't really about redemptive qualities; which since there's barely any on show is a rather good thing. Sears movie is grim and potent enough to warrant a recommendation to the serious Western fan, and it's also very easy on the eye. Bonus plot wise comes with two lovely kickers during the pulsating finale. The cast man up and give it gusto and brawn, with Hodiak particularly standing out, and even the inevitable lady character plot-strand {Maria Elena Marques} doesn't cloy or hinder the pace and mood of the piece.

You won't want to ponder too much about it afterwards, but hopefully you will go away thinking that you have been royally entertained by the guns, arrows and fists that have flown and been thrown throughout the movie. 6.5/10",1301270400,20,1828,5.009868421052632

*Plot and ending analyzed*

Ambush at Tomahawk Gap (1953) starts out well enough, but the scriptwriters make absolutely no sense after awhile. Instead of concentrating on the stolid characters, they add the ""evil"" Apache to fill up the runtime, with repeated attacks that are so drawn-out and inconsistent.

A man gets stuck in the Yuma Territorial Prison with a group of robbers who said he was in with them. He's innocent, goes his separate way, but then he saves the group in Apache country in a stupid scene where they all play ""dead"" and the 'idiotic' Apaches come down, and instead of shooting arrows into them, or using knives, or even bullets, they get overtaken by the white guys with ease.

Later, the white guys find an abandoned town and look for a cache of money they had buried there a few years earlier. Apaches again are on the prowl, but they get taken out one by one by the ardent white guys.

It gets repetitive from there on. Apaches make no gains at all, merely providing enough gun-fodder for the group. That's about it, the end scene has the innocent man finding the Apaches, who are just dancing around a fire and singing songs instead of trying to kill them, and he jumps in with gunpowder to blow them all to death.

The whole film is a waste of time merely because it insults the viewers' sensibility.",1478390400,,1370,4.571428571428571

8029915,5,B0002OI4B6,I remember this movie as a kid.  THe whole cast was great.  This was the second time both John Hodiak and Maria Eleana Marques appeared together the first was Across The Wide Missouri with Clark Gable.  David Brian always the villan and Ray Teal could play both villan  and the good guy and  John Derek held his own.,1441756800,,316,4.379310344827586

8029917,5,B0002OI4B6,"Brutal and violent this is one no-nonsense Western that plays it's hand out right out to the end. Sam Peckinpah probably loved this Western, I know I did. From the opening scene of David Brian spitting his tobacco juice on the prison wagon to the climatic blazing finale this is one low budget Western that truly delivers the goods in a way that THE BIG COUNTRY, HOW THE WEST WAS WON, or THE WAY WEST never can, hamstrung by BIG budgets and BIG casts. AMBUSH AT TOMAHAWK GAP easily slides under the radar as a second bill programmer, however, Fred Sears' masterful direction (he's an ace at this stuff) and great performances by John Hodiak, David Brian and Ray Teal, all underappreciated actors, set this apart from the rest. Sweaty, grimy, offbeat and very, very rewarding in cinematic viewing pleasure. Even female interest, Maria Elena Marques doesn't distract from the proceedings and is even an important part of the plot development as opposed to being just mere window dressing. Her skirt and clothing are torn and tattered so she fits right in with this unshaven ragtag outfit in which everyone is brutal and out for themselves. I won't give away plot points here, that would lessen your viewing experience. The Technicolor photography and location shooting is superior and the Sony Choice Collection is as no frills as the film itself. An outstanding release of an outstanding 1950s Western, tight and taut. Recommended.",1423872000,5,1430,4.913223140495868
8029918,5,B0002OI4B6,I first saw this movie when it was released in 1953.  I was 12 or 13 years old then and really liked it. In those days you could go to a theater and stay as long as you wanted to on one ticket.  I saw it three times in one day.  At 73 I still enjoyed it (can't say that about a lot of movies I saw as a child).  Glad to see it finally come out on DVD (should have been Bluray).  See my review on SWELTER for a comparison.,1413072000,,421,3.5824175824175826
