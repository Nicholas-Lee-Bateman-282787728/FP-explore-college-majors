3000373,5,B000XBPDXK,This is a well made and educational DVD. John Harrison was indeed ahead of his time.,1226966400,2,84,4.3125
3000374,5,B000XBPDXK,"This is a super dramatization and historical account of the sometimes less than scientific search for a way to find longitude at sea.

The video is beautifully produced and the acting is great.  The science is accurate and engaging for all levels of understanding.

Harrison's genius is expertly portrayed and his contribution to the scientific method is well documented.  The prejudice of the so-called learned academics against the practitioner is a reminder that we can still miss the boat with preconceptions.

Highly recommended.",1223251200,22,534,5.385542168674699
3000375,5,B000XBPDXK,"It seems to be trivial to know where you are, especially when the era of GPS (global positioning system) starts in 1995. It is, however, a challenge to know this at sea in the 1700s. Although one can tell the latitude by measuring the angle of the sun at noon, there is no practical way to know the longitude at that time. This makes navigation unreliable and deadly.

Most people, including Isaac Newton, think this problem must be solved by astronomers, or professors in famous universities by measuring the stars or the moon. It is John Harrison, an unschooled carpenter and watchmaker from the country, to get this job done and win the 20,000 pounds (millions in today's dollars) by his custom-made clock.

The key to know where you are is to know what time it is. This is still the principle that GPS works today. The clocks in GPS are atomic. However, the clocks then are mechanic and are very difficult, if not impossible, to maintain its precision at sea due to the shaking of a ship. In addition, the gravity, temperature and friction are also factors to make a clock imprecise when traveling a long distance. Finally, it took John Harrison 58 years to overcome all these and make longitude predictable at sea.

What we think straightforward may go through long struggles. What we think a reasonable and better idea may turn out impractical. It is fun to learn the above while watching this film. And it would be good if more people know about this history.",1202774400,29,1466,4.652509652509653
3000376,5,B000XBPDXK,"Based on the bestselling book Longitude by Dava Sobel, the program tells the story of how an unknown genius, John Harrison, discovered the key to navigating on the open seas and thus solved one of the thorniest problems of the 1700s.",1091491200,,233,4.7073170731707314
3000377,5,B000XBPDXK,"This is a well done documentary that is a hybrid of drama with historical fact. Having some of the characters simply speak from their journals sounds unrealistic at times (spoken vs written word) but the technical details are interesting. I watched it to understand the history of navigation and answer some questions about how they performed navigation with various tools. The interesting part of this is how there was a serious political issue involved, in that the scientists of the day insisted that celestial navigation was considered the only reliable method.

This DVD presents the material in the book quite well, and you can understand the problem.  I enjoyed reading the book first, as it enhanced the material presented here. Most people have forgotten that this was a world wide crisis , and many lives were lost because sailors could only figure Latitude...... they had no idea where they were located, north of south of that latitude.  This has become lost in history, but many scientists were working to solve this problem, as we work today to find a cure for cancer.  Great part of our history.",1380758400,,635,4.535087719298246

8227746,5,B000XBPDXK,"I enjoyed your Nova presentation of this very important event in the history of naval navigation. The calculation of latitude dated back to before the Great Pyramid of 2600 BCE but the calculation of longitude at sea had relied for over 4000 years on knowing the direction and speed of the sailing ship in a sea which  contained currents which were mostly unknown.

This was a truly magnificent scientific or if you prefer Engineering adventure in design.

The disregard of Newton as to the possibility of designing and building a suitably accurate timepiece displayed his arrogance

In this same time period Newton brushed off the findings of Robert Hook who in his crude way PROVED THE LAW OF GRAVITY
that is he showed that his orbital pendulum could predict the period of a low altitude satellite which raised to the orbital period of the moon could predict its distance correctly only if the gravity of the Earth was reduced as the square of the relative distance

Newton brushed off Hooke and his simple calculations saying "" he does not understand the mathematics""

This same arrogance of the committee resulted in the failure to recognize the genius of Mr Harrison",1439596800,3,1171,4.85929648241206
