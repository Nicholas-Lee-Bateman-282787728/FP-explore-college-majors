8288118,5,B001CK7OMY,"This 2008 documentary 'Shadows in Paradise' is about the writers such as Thomas Mann and his brother Heinrich, known for his novel which became the film 'The Blue Angel', and people in the music industry who were fortunate to leave Europe and eventually settled in California or as it was referred to in another documentary - Weimar on the Pacific. The Manns were not Jewish and left for political reasons. Other artists had a difficult time adjusting to their new world.  You'll see home movies, hear some of their music, and their recollections from letters and memoirs via voiceovers from actors. There's interviews with people including their children and actors Norman Lloyd and Vincent Price who socialized with them. Fritz Lang briefly repeats his famous story of fleeing Germany immediately after a meeting with Goebbels. Every time Lang told the Goebbels story in interviews, he embellished it. Goebbels does not mention this meeting in his diaries. Patrick McGilligan's 1997 biography 'Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast' debunks that story by showing how his passport revealed he made a few trips outside of Germany before finally leaving. Anyway this documentary lasts an hour but is filled with a lot of info. You can watch a clip on YouTube.",1430611200,,1256,5.038461538461538

8288120,5,B001CK7OMY,"Although many books and articles have been published about the emigrants and exiles in Southern California, this DVD is the only compilation of videos with interviews in which we can see and hear them and watch brief scenes of their everyday lives.  The engagement of writers and musicians with the film industry, sometimes successful and often not, is emphasized.  Interviews carried out for this documentary with descendants and associates who are still alive add much information and insight.",1367366400,5,495,5.333333333333333

8288122,4,B001CK7OMY,"Interesting history?  You bet. Screenwriters, theater stars, musicians pushed out by Hitler's anti-semitic policies in the 1930's came to Hollywood and Los Angeles and participated in the film industry.  A key example was Erich Wolfgang Korngold who wrote symphonic backgrounds for the movies of the time.  These persons  (mostly men) obtained houses close to each other and participated in a German salon of intellectual talent during this key period of Hollywood history.  Then, when the country turned ultra-conservative after the war, toward the end of the 1940's, some of the Jewish talent was forced back into Germany because they were ""too liberal.""  These were the same men who attacked totalitarian rules in all its forms. That's why they were dangerous minds.

My favorite story in the movie was that of Erich Zeisl and his family.  He was an unimportant (Jewish) musician who needed to get out of Germany fast. So he wrote to all the Zeisl's in the New York Phone Book Directory, desperately asking for a ""Zeisl"" sponsor to help him emigrate to America.  The intelligentsia and well-to-do ignored his letters.  But his life was saved because one man, a plumber, yes a plumber, had the good sense to sponsor these Zeisls.  History moves in strange ways.",1273622400,17,1263,5.024038461538462
