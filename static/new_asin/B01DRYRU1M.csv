8756762,4,B01DRYRU1M,"It's a good mystery series but not in the league of the other new British mysteries like Shetland, Hinterland, and Chasing Shadows.  The stories based on Sophie Hannah  books were not that interesting especially, The Other Half Lives, it was very predicable. The two lead detectives don't have a considerable amount of chemistry together. It's a grade or two above New Tricks and Midsomer Murders without John Nettles. If there was a season two I would watch it.",1426377600,6,462,4.910256410256411
8756763,5,B01DRYRU1M,"Case sensitive is a fine new serie. I would like that they continue its production, becouse this two first issues where filmed in 2011. The actors are subtile, atractives and strong personalities. The stories are interesting and with an incresely suspense. The production is class A. If you like series like the old Silent witness, Luther or The killing, you would enjoy this films.",1350086400,12,382,4.984375
