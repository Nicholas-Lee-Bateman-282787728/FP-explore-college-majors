6876394,5,B00QLM5IXK,Based on a famous fantasy novel by Leung Yu Sang (a version of which was previously filmed as the Bride with White Hair parts 1 and 2 starring Brigitte Lin Ching Hsia and Leslie Cheung in 1993). This lavish period piece occurs at the time the Manchus are looking to invade China and take over the country. The special effects are excellent and the action and of course the internal politics and the double crossing of the various factions which occurs. There is a number of bonus feature concerning the making of the film etc.,1429401600,3,526,4.5473684210526315

6876402,3,B00QLM5IXK,"White Haired Witch wasn't a bad film. It just wasn't as impressive to me as the Bride with White Hair films, staring Brigitte Lin.

I'm not going to delve too far into the plot, as the story was quite extensive. You really have to follow the characters and their motivations to understand what's going on. That being said, the main addition I liked in the film was the action. It was definitely updated from the early 90's and the action was probably its shining point. I also thought the realistic approach, to the overall story arch, was a good direction to go in, considering the older version had more of a fantasy atmosphere to it. However, I still think The Bride With White Hair films were much better. And here's why.

The creative style being used in Hong Kong Cinema during the early 90s, helped make this story stand out back then. The scenes were primarily filmed in dark environments, and it added to the fantastic flare of the film overall. The special effects weren't as good at the time of course, but they did a good job with what they had, and I still think Brigitte Lin's hair attacks were some of the best I've seen, when it comes to these types of movies. Her clan, and ultimately her antagonists, were much darker in the earlier film and behaved more like cult leaders. Her relationship with the wolves was flushed out better, and the betrayal, that turns her hair white, was much stronger in the Bride With White Hair. And all that aside, there was just something about the way Brigitte Lin played her character that's hard to beat. She could be soft and attractive in some scenes. But then she could become the fiercest warrior.  When you saw Brigitte Lin with white hair and those fierce eyes, she was a witch to be reckoned with.

Anyway, White Haired Witch is presented in Mandarin with English subtitles No dub is available.

In the end I'm giving White Haired Witch a 3. I found it to be a little slow in some parts. And for me, I missed some of the elements added in the earlier version of this story. If you do check out the other two films with Brigitte Lin, just know, The Bride with White Hair 1 is the better of the two films. Although, the second, Bride with White Hair film, attempted the same stylistic approach of the first. In any case, they would be good films to check out, if this one peeked your interest.",1446508800,6,2349,4.453488372093023

8691855,3,B00QLM5IXK,"I'm always in the mood for a good wuxia-fantasy, and ""The White-Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom"" has everything you'd expect from the genre: a noble hero, a sprawling plot, a number of gravity-defying action scenes, and an enigmatic woman at its heart.

Based on the novel ""Baifa Mon Zhuan"" by Liang Yusheng, the story is set in the last days of the Ming Dynasty, a time in which China is threatened by both foreign invaders and internal corruption. Famine spreads across the land, but a woman known only as Jade Raksha helps the starving people by attacking soldiers and stealing supplies.

From the Wudang Mountains journeys a man called Zhuo Yihang, chosen by his people to deliver the Emperor's medicine to the palace. On the way he gets caught up in the political machinations of his country when he crosses paths with Jade Raksha. Just as he's accused of the Emperor's assassination when the red pills seemingly kill him, Raksha is framed for the death of Governor Zhuo  Yihang's grandfather.

Despite this, the two manage to fall in love in the tranquillity of Lunar Kingdom, a beautiful but strategically important citadel in the mountains. The film manages to build a fairly sweet love story between the two of them, with Raksha drawn to Yihang's kindness and wisdom (instead of rakishness or faux-charm  as you'd expect from a Western production). Huang Xiaoming exudes warmth and good humour, while Fan Bingbing is an ethereal beauty. It's easy to see why their characters might fall in love.

The plot is difficult to unravel, with all the arranged marriages, child emperors, war generals, devious eunuchs, masked secret police, double-crosses, and conflicted spies you could hope for  good luck untangling it all! The film doesn't give us much time to fully grasp the political situation, and the pacing is downright frantic at times. Even the quieter moments feel rushed.

But an interesting pattern arises over the course of the film: one that requires each of the main characters to give up something precious for the greater good: Wei Zhongxian becomes a eunuch in order to free his daughter, Zhuo Yihang endangers his own integrity to protect Wudan's reputation, Jin Duyi surrenders his ambition in order to fulfil his father's orders, and Jade Raksha is faced with the choice of giving up her memories of Yihang in order to learn the techniques she needs to save his life. It's a compelling theme of sacrifice found in heroes and villains alike, and one I wish could have been explored more with more measured pacing.

There are some beautiful images and fight scenes, though the green-screen effects leave a lot to be desired, as does some of the CGI. And despite the otherwise lovely soundtrack, the film chooses to end with a maudlin pop song that renders the final scene completely silly.
I watched it with English subtitles, some of which felt far too modern (using slang and expressions such as ""sis"" and ""she fell for him"" and so on) but it's an entertaining film while it lasts, neither terrible nor excellent.",1467072000,,3035,4.889105058365759

8691857,4,B00QLM5IXK,"I hear there's an earlier version of the same story (""The Bride with White Hair"") from the 90s. Haven't seen it so no comparisons there. The move has a great, emotional story, but with a little over an hour and a half run time things felt very rushed. The lead actors are great, and balance each other in regards to driving the story. The effects look as good as anything Hollywood puts out. Caveat: sometimes the film does go into the realm of cheese with montage and pop song, but just ride it out. Action sequences on par with some of the better stuff, putting even the sequel to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" to shame. And that movie had Donnie Yen and Michelle Yeoh!",1458864000,,674,4.443548387096774
