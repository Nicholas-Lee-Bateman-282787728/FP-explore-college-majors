8473432,5,B005HP2JIE,"A somewhat dated but excellent basic overview of the life of the threatened sea otters.  Great introduction to the sea otter and natural environment in which these attractive critters have to survive.  Everyone, especially those of us who live in the coastal states of the U.S.  should be more aware of the condition of our shoreline and what sea otters and other sea creatures have to face, especially given climate change, acidification of the oceans, etc.",1440028800,,458,5.0
