[Note 2: The title of this film is simply INTERVIEW. ""Dogma #7:"" is not a part of the real title.]

This is a highly pretentious movie - a half hearted effort at an art house style. The Dogme 95 style, to be precise. This is the 7th film that closely - but not rigorously - follows that movement's ""vows of chastity"".

It's almost a movie within a movie. The framing story follows a group of filmmakers as they string together interviews between couples of various types into some statement on love. But then one of the filmmakers is drawn to a soft-spoken, secretive young woman who has become an interview subject (altho, it's not clear if it's love that draws him).

Her history is revealed via flashbacks -- the cleverness and the subtle manner of these revelations (and others) impressed me and kept my interest. However, the interviews of the other couples caused me to cringe - altho one couple did resolve in an interesting way.

The secretive woman is played by one of South Korea's biggest movie stars, the very pretty Shim Eun Ha (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CHRISTMAS-IN-AUGUST/dp/B0009WIEH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ART-MUSEUM-BY-THE-ZOO/dp/B003EHD062/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ART MUSEUM BY THE ZOO</a>). She manages to build a deeply melancholy and touching portrait. No other actor in the film comes close -- thanks to the script.

This is Shim Eun Ha's last movie to date. It was released in 2000 when she was about 27 years old. It appears to have been her seventh film. It was not a lucky number.",1263686400,,1816,5.4678571428571425
