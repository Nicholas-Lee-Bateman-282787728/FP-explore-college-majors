8517447,5,B007IAPU0A,"When I moved from Albuquerque I knew it was going to be a challenge to find another teacher. Unfortunately, I was correct.  Nothing beats taking her classes but if you live out of town, I definitely recommend buying this.  It's for all levels.  The best part is that there are several classes to choose from on one DVD!",1408665600,,319,4.4655172413793105
8517448,5,B007IAPU0A,We are very loyal after attending Aparna's classes in Albuquerque for several years.  This DVD does not disappoint.  Don't worry if you're a beginner or getting back into yoga after a break - there are nice cues to guide positions to your level.  We have bought copies for several friends in other cities who are training for marathons or want to add a new dimension to their exercise routine.  Go for it!,1360195200,2,405,4.583333333333333

8517450,5,B007IAPU0A,"Aparna brings her in-depth knowledge and experience to this exceptional DVD.  Visually exquisite and professionally done, The Rhythm of Vinyasa DVD offers a full range of yoga practice for the experienced beginner or the more advanced. The special features section includes guided relaxation, pranayama, and meditation.  It's great to be able to enjoy a relaxation session or practice pranayama when time is limited.  Aparna's provides gentle guidance and intuitive instruction throughout the DVD. She will coax  you to go deeper in your practice with an attitude of self-acceptance.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone willing to explore and challenge themselves.",1333929600,,667,5.564356435643564
8517451,5,B007IAPU0A,"I have practiced yoga for many years, and was fortunate to find Aparna a few years ago. She is an excellent teacher. I had thought several times that it would be wonderful if Aparna would make a DVD.  Luckily for me, she made a video and I bought one.  It is excellent!  This practice has strengthened my core and increased my flexibility.  This DVD is so good that I bought two more--one for my daughter and one for my niece.  I would recommend this DVD to everyone.",1333843200,,467,4.32183908045977
8517452,5,B007IAPU0A,"Having been a student in Aparna's classes, I found this video to be a great tool for practice at home.  Generous and open in her yoga instruction, Aparna's example reminds us of the real practice of acceptance and abundance.  this is a beautiful video and I felt challenged and encouraged by it.  Thank you Aparna!",1333411200,2,314,4.672727272727273
8517453,5,B007IAPU0A,"This a great DVD suitable for a range of experience levels.  Aparna balances a physical asana practice with meditation in each section of the DVD.  Her pacing is calm without being sluggish and provides plenty of support for beginner yogis while providing more experienced practitioners with further variations.  While this video is not for the complete novice (you need some basic knowledge of yoga poses and terminology), it is accessible to all other levels.  For an idea of the main practice, centering is followed by a practice that combines vinyasa (flow) with static poses and then  a meditation for the level 1 and pranayama  for level 2 and finisheds with guided savasana.  There are a number of other resources on the DVD as well for more focused work: the bonus section provides opportunities for deeper work and the special features isolate pranayama and meditation.

Aparna's deeply rooted philosophy of blending the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of yoga in each practice shines through in this DVD.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for an aid in their home practice that will meet all of these needs in a calm, balanced way.  Thanks Aparna!!",1332979200,2,1171,5.052083333333333
8517454,5,B007IAPU0A,"Aparna's qualities which make her such an exceptional teacher shine on this DVD. Wonderful to be able to have her instructions at home. This is the best yoga instructional I have ever seen. A wonderful mix of relaxation and vigorous exercise. I hope she will have a sequel.
Strongly recommended.",1332892800,,295,4.92
8517455,5,B007IAPU0A,This video is beautifully put together both visually and educationally.  It helps me practice yoga without stress.  Anyone who needs to practice at home will benefit physically and spiritually.  Marilyn,1332806400,,202,5.666666666666667
8517456,5,B007IAPU0A,"For those who have experienced Aparna's classes, this DVD is a perfect guide for home practice, or for when you miss her guided relaxation so bad that you just can't wait for another class!  For those who never had classes with her, the DVD is a great chance to experience what I believe to be one of the purest expressions of yoga. I had many yoga instructors, but Aparna is just special. The DVD is divided into three main parts: a neat Introduction and Practice Guidelines set the tone of how she conducts the practice of yoga. Then, you can choose between two different levels of Vinyasa, one more basic and the other a little more advanced. Last, but not least, there is a bonus section and special features with a workshop on how to prepare the body for more advanced backbends; an amazing chakra balancing meditation; pranayama practice; and guided relaxation. In short, this DVD is a whole package for body, mind, and soul. Oh, and the music is just amazing.",1332288000,,966,4.616279069767442
