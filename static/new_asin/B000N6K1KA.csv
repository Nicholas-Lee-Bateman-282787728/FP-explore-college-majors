Eventhough Melba didn't do everything on the film, the performances are very good.  The story is a little corny, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film.",1340236800,,263,4.8

8175409,5,B000N6K1KA,"This picture was on at the Busan theater in South Korea, 1955 when I was a boy. At that time I go to the this movie lead a elder sister by the hand. For my child's eyes, It has been amazing a reflection - beautiful fantastic stage costume, stage setting and songs.
 The heroin of this picture is real character, Australian legendary soprano singer Nellie Melba. Actually this is a fictional biopic-movie. However has a interesting story-line, good plot.
 The cast of heroin is Patrice Munsel who Metropolitan Prima donna of 1950s. Originally cast was planned Lily Pons, She refused cordially for reason of her own age.
 I was wondering about distributor, visual quality good or poor and I'm afraid this DVD image is wrong.",1319414400,4,722,4.76
