8473151,5,B001271EYG,"This is an outstanding documentary from 1975 that was added to the National Film Registry in 2005. Highly engaging (and enraging), it tells the story of a flood in a coal mining town in West Virginia in 1972 that killed 125 people and injured over 1000 more. All of this was preventable, and the fault lies with the coal mining company. To say more would be to give too much away. Watching the film (and its sequel, included on this disc) is the best way to learn about the tragedy. I feel compelled to mention that this DVD can be purchased directly from the Appalshop website for $30.",1405728000,3,586,4.435185185185185
