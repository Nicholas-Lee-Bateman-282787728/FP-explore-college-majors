6105571,3,B00GRZPR96,The movie was look I like the characters.  This is a modern day version of Pompeii and it is full of action and it is a very good TV movie.  I enjoyed the movie very much.,1397260800,,171,3.7222222222222223
6105572,4,B00GRZPR96,Action adventure with a few twists and turns. Love it when fathers turn out to be the hero! And Jhey Castles was awesome!,1396656000,,121,4.304347826086956
6105573,3,B00GRZPR96,"The two things that struck me about the movie initially, were the cinematography and the special effects. Both were good and I settled in for a good experience. The cinematography remained respectable but the special effects plummeted in, well, effectiveness. The only thing I could conclude is that the opening effects may have been actual footage of volcanic action which ran out before long. The story line was plausible but strained my imagination at times. Such as, why gather a rescue team of commandos armed to the teeth for a volcanic explosion. I think I expected more than the movie could produce.",1395100800,4,607,4.96078431372549
6105574,3,B00GRZPR96,"So far I've been on a roll with purchasing The Asylum flims, one release after the other. I've been a big fan of theirs for a while now and now with one of their latest releases, Apocalypse Pompeii, serves as a testament to their consistency. Well.... their movies are really hit or miss for those of you that aren't fans of The Asylum flicks but for those of you that like the B rated movie cheesiness, impossible odds and some good laughs, then this is the flick for you. Sure, there are billions of disaster movies out there and they're all different in story and in budget. However, all disaster movies use the same formula. Apocalypse Pompeii also has a surprisingly good supporting cast with that of John Rhys-Davies and Adrian Paul!!! Truthfully, without any monsters or space ships, this movie took a while for me to warm up to but in the end I still enjoyed it. Not one of the best movies to come out of The Asylum studios but it's good to watch on a day where you don't want to leave the house.",1394150400,8,1004,4.374331550802139
6105575,3,B00GRZPR96,"This film is a mock buster that has nothing to do with another film recently released that has ""Pompeii"" in its title. Asylum did something similar with the ""Three Musketeers"" a few years back, making a movie with a similar name, but in a different time period.

This film follows the same identical plot as all of Asylum disaster films. Family separates. Disaster strikes. Super Dad (Adrian Paul) rescues family. In this film the teen daughter (Georgina Beedle) turns into Bill Nye the science guy to save everyone from a volcano. The acting was Asylum grade. The film answers the question:  If 100 monkeys were placed at 100 type writers, could they eventually come up with an Asylum script?

The film is overly CG. The early question I have was why did the opening scene contain a view of Rio and then have volcanoes go off somewhere else? The cross at Rio is the most recognized landmark in the world. Then we have John Rhys-Davies as Colonel Dillard, except he is now Carlos Dillard as opposed to Colonel Ralph Dillard from ""100 Degrees Below Zero"" when Europe was destroyed. Who would notice?

3 star cheese film. Not as cheesy as ""100 Degrees Below Zero"" but it tries.

6105576,5,B00GRZPR96,"It isn't going to win any academy awards, but it wasn't created to do that.  This is just entertainment.  If you are looking for world class films, then maybe stick to movies that were in a theater.  Hey, even some of those suck, but at least this one didn't wast hundreds of millions of dollars.

Does it suck?  No.  Is it as good as Dante's Peak?  Meh... probably not.  It is its own entertainment and I'll bet the people who did it had a great time doing it.  It is a movie I will love to watch when there isn't anything new coming out and I just need an hour and a half of distraction.  Plus I love Adrian Paul and I'll watch anything he is in.  I'd replay shoelace commercials if they had Adrian Paul in it, so clearly I'm not overly concerned with production value.  This is a great B movie and anybody who likes B movies will enjoy it.",1393372800,4,842,4.12962962962963
6105577,5,B00GRZPR96,"This movie had it all: volcanoes, helicopter dogfights, cleavage, HEAT SURGE, volcanic ash, cleavage, John Rhys-Davies, hot lava, and cutting-edge chromakey work. I laughed, I cried, I kissed 5 bucks goodbye. Highly recommended!",1393200000,9,228,5.9393939393939394
6105578,1,B00GRZPR96,"Let's not mince words when it comes to the tragic end of something. In this case, the end of the main feature takes on a whole new meaning - mainly because it brings you to tears... of gratitude. After the opening sequence, I realised that the budget had certainly not been spent on state-of-the-art special effects and hoped that some disappointment might be mitigated by a decent cast and reasonable acting. Wrong. I could go on but it would be pointless - so I won't. Bottom line - rubbish.",1393027200,6,493,4.550561797752809

6105629,4,B00GRZPR96,"I'm probably overrating this with 4 stars, but what the heck.  I did like it...overlooking some special effects flubs and artificial tension stretchers.  And who goes on a tour of a city that was buried in a volcanic eruption without knowing anything about volcanoes?  Evidently even tour guides.  But fortunately there was a teenage girl (?) along who knew exactly what to do to save everybody.  Of course her mother was useless - even before she sprained her ankle - but then we knew that long before the volcano erupted.  I was impressed by the one guy getting taken out (uh...the graphics I mean) because it was a lot better than the shot where a woman is obviously yanked from the side a little too slowly.

But overall, I liked this movie...and that's what 4 stars means!",1468368000,2,777,4.627737226277373

Their chance for survival was quite slim. The flow of energy and excitement was maintained for the most part throughout the movie. And I admire a male protagonist who demonstrates such deep and abiding love for his wife and child. I know its a movie and ideals can become real only in movies but its  ""ideals"" that inspire us often to take baby steps to make our little versions of whats good and harmonious that can bring joy in our lives within the framework of our realities.",1468195200,2,624,4.571428571428571

Perhaps the giveaway is when the director list includes ""et al."" But, to be fair, whoever got the actual shots of Pompeii gave the film some nice visuals.

6105686,3,B00GRZPR96,I thought it was OK. You could tell what was going to happen pretty much. I thought the guy taking pictures when everything was falling and exploding around them was funny.,1457740800,,172,4.580645161290323
6105687,4,B00GRZPR96,"Had a feeling about this one, not a bad movie at all for grade B. It flows well (sorry could not resist that one). Keeps the tension going plus a nice little lesson on how to survive volcano's. Acting is good and you do care for the victims. The ending was a bit weak but expected. Not too shabby I enjoyed it.",1457740800,3,310,4.016129032258065
6105688,4,B00GRZPR96,Pretty good -- lots of tourists died -- only so many would fit in escape plan.  All in all -- it was enjoyable.,1457654400,,111,3.8260869565217392

6105692,5,B00GRZPR96,I do love these kinds of movies and it was a good movie BUT the only reason I gave it 5 stars is because Adrian Paul was in it...!!,1457222400,,131,3.5517241379310347

6105696,2,B00GRZPR96,interesting but poorly written storyline,1455580800,,40,7.2

6105699,5,B00GRZPR96,"If you are not an expert on volcanoes or been to Pompeii.. (dramatic pause) Don't say how bad this film is! I have studied volcanoes and written a paper (which I got an A+ on) about Vesuvius. I also have been there!  There was some stretch of science and normal Hollywood cinema action,
but this was an excellent film. What happened as cinematic tricks in this were no worse than a standard James B. film. Its easy to criticize,  but do it from experience, not just empty opinion.  By the way, the girl's information on the St. Pierre Volcano was accurate. All but 1 died and he was in a prison.",1438646400,2,595,4.342342342342342

6105703,5,B00GRZPR96,Thank you.,1424995200,,10,4.5
6105704,5,B00GRZPR96,Came quickly and as promised. Enjoyed the movie as well.,1423612800,,56,4.7
6105705,3,B00GRZPR96,"The use of the term `apocalypse' in this title suggests a global catastrophe.  Unfortunately, this movie is anything but a disaster of Biblical proportions.

As one family of three is dramatically killed in the opening sequence, another family of three is moving to Italy just in time to get caught in another eruption.  While the dad (Adrian Paul as Jeff Pierce) is off on a job interview, his wife and volcano expert daughter are taking a tour through the ruins of Pompeii.  Wouldn't you know it, that pesky volcano Mr. Vesuvius picks that very moment to erupt.  What are the odds?

I'd like to be able to say this is a very exciting movie full of thrills, chills, death, and destruction, but it's not.  Instead, you have this lackluster story of potential peril unrealized.  The lack of urgency is astounding.  Most of the actors look like they'd rather be somewhere else (too many characters with vacant expressions on their faces).  Even John Rhys-Davies looked uncomfortable and he should be used to appearing in clinkers.  Of the lot, only Dylan Vox (as Kal the tourist) bothered to act like there's no tomorrow.

This is a ponderous effort hampered by common story elements, less than compelling characters, typical CGI used too sparingly, and very little excitement.  I wasn't impressed.  (But.  I also can't seem to summon up enough enthusiasm to say I hated it.)  Eh.  I've seen worse.",1423440000,,1396,4.8474576271186445
6105706,3,B00GRZPR96,"Not the worst I've seen and definitely not they best.  Never really gives a good explanation for all the volcanoes erupting around the world and can someone please explain to me how a man is about to bleed out one moment and flying a helicopter the next?  I loved how people in Naples were pretty much just going around their own business, no scenes of evacuation, no sense of panic, just la de da, going to just stand here and work on my car while a mountain rains fire on the city.",1417910400,,483,4.239130434782608

6105711,2,B00GRZPR96,"This movie's effects are low-moderate. The acting seems very good, but the script is weak and doesn't offer many surprises. IF you don't have anything else to watch, this might be a time-filler, and you can cook dinner while it plays and not miss much.",1402185600,,252,4.622222222222222

money badly spent",1397779200,,102,4.15
6105716,5,B00GRZPR96,"Having visited Italy years ago, I am so happy to own this DVD.  Being on one's own, rather than in a group in Italy is far better in that you can do what you like when you want to.  Tour groups are not my idea of a good time.",1397692800,,225,3.5714285714285716
6105717,3,B00GRZPR96,"I have to admit that I love watching crappy movies, with plot holes big enough to drive semis through, preposterous science, and so so acting, but this one is pretty good for an Asylum offering.  Especially when you factor in that it stars Adrian Paul, who is still so good looking!, and John Rhys-Davies.  I have to admit, it hurts my heart to see Rhys-Davies in this type of movie, but I guess you have to pay the bills somehow.  But he doesn't have to be too ashamed of this effort.  The science is there, it's just funny how it's interpreted, and by whom.  A teenager who has more answers than Bill Nye, the Science Guy,  I don't think so.  And flying a helicopter through an cloud of ash without going down, nah.  But whoever said that Asylum movies made sense.  That's the fun of them.  So if you have an hour and a half to waste and about four bucks, this is for you.",1397606400,,874,4.242424242424242
8626535,1,B00GRZPR96,"This movie smells worse than the sulfur fumes from Vesuvius! I'm not going to excuse it because it's a TV (?) movie. The CGI effects are fine. It's the characters. An obnoxious teen girl , who seems to know everything about volcanoes ( ""when other girls were playing with dolls, I was playing with rocks"") leads the most uninteresting group of tourists (and her lame mother)  all over the ruins of Pompeii, and always just one step ahead of each disaster posed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, while her frantic father, back in Naples, gets his old Army buddies (who just happen to be in Italy) to go on a rescue mission to pick up the losers. Awful acting and cliche' - driven dialogue are the order of the day, and even an appearance by the always-delightful JOHN RHYS-DAVIES can't save this stinker. And for lovers of so-bad-they're-good movies, this isn't even bad enough to be enjoyable; it's just tedious.",1529971200,,911,4.658385093167702
