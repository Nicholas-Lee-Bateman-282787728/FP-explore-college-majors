2062904,4,B000255LIY,"I have not seen the first version of this film done in 1968 and from what I've heard the newer version does not match up at all. However, watching the film was a very enjoyable experience. I picked this film up because it has Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the King of France in it- he does a stunning job as do all the actors. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first purchased this DVD but I was very pleased. I was pleased with the work the actors did and the dialouge (which was very dry and bitter humour). It is a long film and at the last 3 or 5 scenes my patience with the film had waned and I was longing for it to be over. Though it is good, it is by no means astounding. Overall, I'd say watch this one on a rainy Sunday but I wouldn't rush out to buy it unless you are (like me) a tremendous fan of one of the actors in this film.",1090281600,2,842,3.8728323699421967
2062905,3,B000255LIY,"In a world which sees more and more remakes - some classics are better left alone. This is one of them.  Glenn Close is no Katherine Hepburn and that's probably the major weakness of this remake although Patrick Stewart isn't a Peter O'Toole either.  The image of Jean-Luc Picard keeps popping up and you keep expecting him to utter something like ""Make it so, Number One"" at any moment.
The original also gave us a pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton as Phillip of France in a vastly underrated performance. And let's not forget Anthony Hopkins as Richard.
Historically, if this movie were to be made with any accuracy it would feature French actors instead of English ones since French was the language spoken by Henry and his family. It's highly unlikely any of them - including Richard and John - spoke much if any English, so if its going to be re-done, perhaps utilizing French actors is the answer.
Meanwhile, pop in your DVD of the O'Toole/Hepburn original and if you're wondering which version to purchase - go with the original.",1088553600,14,1032,4.727777777777778
2062906,3,B000255LIY,"To be sure, the reasoning behind many of today's films defies understanding. This one is no exception.
Although the main stars all give adequate performances, and the screenplay is exactly the same as the original, the question remains. Why remake one of the finest films of all time? Who could have possibly thought there was room for improvement? Why not remake Casablanca or Citizen Kane while we're at it?
Again, I fault not the actors in this treatment, for they all did fine jobs - if pale by comparison to the originals. My problems with this film stem with the powers that be who decided to produce it in the first place.",1088121600,7,629,4.625
2062907,3,B000255LIY,"One correction for a previous review. JULIE Harris was not in the Broadway production of ""Lion In Winter"". It was another wonderful actress, ROSEMARY Harris.

2062908,5,B000255LIY,"I was certainly a pleasant surprise that this fast paced (not in action to be sure) intellectual game of intrigue and give and take could keep my solid attention for the full movie. The viewers attention is required to keep track of the plot twists and turns as we see King Henry sparring with his wife Elanor and his three woebegotten sons in the hills of France.
The greatest thing about this movie is that it depicts an interpretation of the life and times of King henry II, Richard and of course Prince John, an era that I have always felt were taken hostage by Shakespeare and Arthur and the knights of the round table......
Certainly a great depiction/interpretation of historical value that would, for me in any case, be too troublesome to read.
I do give the viewer fair warning without any intellectual snobbery intended. The story is complex and chacrter development is long but thorough .... The action is of course limited and most, if not all the movie takes place on the set of the castle..... Unless you enjoy this type of human chess game, oddds are that you'll walk out after the first half hour ...",1086566400,6,1116,4.585
2062909,4,B000255LIY,"It is impossible for me to watch this Showtime remake of ""The Lion in Winter"" starring Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart without constantly comparing it to the 1968 theatrical film with Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole.  That was the first Hepburn film I ever saw and the way she delivers James Goldman's great lines (my favorite would be ""I could peel you like a pear and God himself would call it justice!"") is forever etched in my brain.

However, I also think that it is clear that the specter of the original film hangs over the entire cast of this production.  By that I mean that it seems like every single memorable line from the play (and there are literally dozens) is delivered in a decidedly different way.  Specifically, Close plays Eleanor of Aquitaine as being much more emotional, which is rather ironic given that her ex-husband, the late King of France, is described as being a weeper.  This means that when Eleanor has what should be her final emotional collapse at the end of the film, it is really just another in what has been a series of emotional moments.  As for Stewart, his Henry II tends to underplay all of the key moments.  It certainly seems that every time O'Toole engages in bluster and bombast, Stewart goes quiet, bordering on a whisper.  Again, I can only conclude that these were conscious choices because they stand out so boldly against the original film version.

This is not to say that I am against new productions of the play.  I would have loved to have seen Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris on Broadway or the Roundabout Theater production starring Laurence Fishburne and Stockard Channing.  But Stewart and Close make choices, obviously endorsed by director Andrei Konchalovsky, that remove much of the fire from Goldman's brilliant dialogue.  For those who have never seen a production of ""The Lion in Winter"" they may get a sense of the high quality of the drama, but I do not believe they get the complete picture.

""The Lion in Winter"" takes place during Christmas 1183, when Henry II, King of England, summons family to his castle in Chinon, France.  At issue is the question of who will be Henry's successor to the English throne.  Henry wants his youngest son, John (Rafe Spall), while Eleanor supports their eldest surviving son, Richard the Lionheart (Andrew Howard), which leaves middle son Geoffrey (John Light, in what I think is the best performance because I like his spin on the character).  Also along for the ride are Henry's mistress, Alais Capet (Yuliya Vysotskaya), who is supposed to marry the heir, and her brother, Philip (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the young King of France.

The chief attraction here is that while Henry and the rest play out their power games through a series of confrontations, feints, compromises, and sudden reversals they are delivering their lines with an extraordinary level of insight, wit, and irony.  That is, of course, provided they are delivered so as not to undercut the power of the lines.  The confrontations between Henry and Eleanor are supposed to be a clash of heavyweights and the cast here is dropping down in weight class.",1085788800,14,3132,4.831460674157303
2062910,5,B000255LIY,"Showtime Television has more sophistication in building films than most commercial movie studios and nowhere is that fact more evident than in the 're-make' of THE LION IN WINTER.  Though some would say, ""Why make another version of the 1968 Hepburn/O'Toole award winning movie"", to those I would ask, ""Why continue to reprise the the superb play by James Goldman in theaters around the country?"" Simply, the play is just that good - an exciting mix of history as explored through the dysfunctional family syndrome tying it all together.
The photography of France (as viewed through Slovakia and Hungary settings) in the late 12th century is magnificent, both in exteriors ( Eleanor's entrance on the barge is as grand as Cleopatra's any day!) and in the dank and dark interiors that serve the plot so well.  Glenn Close is radiant and in pitch perfect form as Eleanor of Aquitane, the Queen of England to Henry II's King (Patrick Stewart is fine fettle) and  who has been imprisoned for 10 years for 'treason'.  The couple  has three sons and one must be named Henry's successor, but which one - Richard (historically to be known as The Lionhearted), the wily Jeffrey, or the buffoon but beloved of Henry,  John? (All three of these roles are in capable hands). Eleanor is released from her prison castle for a Christmas Celebration and the entire play takes place during these two stormy days.  The struggle of equally powerful wills of Eleanor and Henry are superimposed on the greed of the three sons, and made more pointed by the arrival of the King of France, Philip (played with complete credibility by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).  Intrigue abounds, secrets long held are made known, and treachery is omnipresent.  But in the midst of this fascinating exposure of monarch history between France and England author Goldman has written dialogue so razor sharp that it suggests Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"": the duets between Eleanor and Henry, the trios and quartets among the brothers and parents, and especially moments like the revelation of the homoerotic relationship between Richard and King Philip are pure theater in the finest sense of the term.  This version of the play is 2 1/2 hours of intense and intensely entertaining bravura acting and direction.  It deserves to be seen , and to be in the libraries of collectors when it becomes available for purchase.",1085356800,18,2389,4.9475

2062934,5,B000255LIY,"While the original is a masterpiece of writing and Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are epic legends of the silver screen....there is not enough in the original to draw interest among my generation. This remakr was necessary because the original was no Gone with the Wind. The best that the original had was the writing and the performance of the two key actors nothing else. Unlike Gone with the Wind there was no great expense or exquisite artwork and design or costumes that would warrant it to not be remade. But this performance, the intensity and raw emotion, the beauty, the authenticity of Henry and Eleanor in the Middle Ages comes to life and does great honor to the original. I believe Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn would be very proud of the performances made by Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart. My generation and future generations rely upon remakes to look back to the original to enjoy both. Every now and then we do need to rejuvenate the originals in order to generate interest in that which is timeless. Just as Neoclassical art generated interest in the original classicism of ancient Rome it intrigues and inspires. I think this is one of the finest re creations I have seen.",1414108800,,1204,4.76555023923445

2062952,5,B000255LIY,"Well I suppose in choosing a favorite version of The Lion in Winter, it all depends on taste. I happen to choose Patrick Stewart over Peter O' Toole, but both Katharine Hepburn, and Glenn Close were Eleanor to the T. Both women capured that strong willed spirit, that makes Eleanor of Aquitaine my favorite queen, hands down. Both O'Toole, and Stewart deliver a king with a bellow, in the winter if his life. But, Stewart in my opinion takes the crown. He is regal.

There is no historical data backing up the Christmas spent in Chinon castle, in the year that Henry II and Eleanor's eldest son passes, to my knowledge. However, Henry II ""allowing"" Eleanor to leave Salisbury castle, where she has been locked up, after a failed revolt against Henry, makes for an interesting story. All of the elements of the personalities of Henry II, Eleanor, Richard, Geoffery, and John are there. I would have thought Henry's mistress would have been Rosamond, but I woukd need to refresh my memory.

As for Phillip of France, and the relationship with Richard the Lionheart goes, I think the jury is still out on that one. But, it added drama to the movie, so I suppose that is why it was included into the storyline.

No matter which movie you choose, The Lion in Winter 1, or 2 you will be in for a treat, the costumes are elaborate,  the scenery beautiful, and the acting superb!",1384300800,,1371,4.583673469387755
2062953,1,B000255LIY,"While Sir Patrick Stewart is magnificent in his role as Henry (as usual), Glenn Close is NOT convincing as either a British or French queen.  The sets and costumes are wonderful.  But that is about all I can say positive about this movie.

Remember ""King Richard the Lionhearted"" from the Robin Hood story?  This movie portrays him as a sniveling homosexual mama's boy.  This movie is one long profane fight between family members.  Glenn Close is constantly telling Patrick Stewart that she slept with his father - then she says she didn't - then she said she did.  She made ""Stepford Wives"" the same year she made this - maybe she got the roles mixed up.

DO NOT let young children watch this movie. It is listed as ""unrated"" but it should be rated MA - there is nudity, profanity, incest and homosexuality.  Normally I would say that any movie with Sir Patrick Stewart in it was worth owning - I will make an exception for this one.",1376784000,4,935,4.517857142857143

  Eleanor has been locked up for years for siding with her sons in a military power struggle against her husband. Many years later Henry, with his young mistress who is supposed to be a bride for Richard The Lionhearted, has decided to have a Christmas Court & invite the whole family, along with King Phillip of France.

2062959,2,B000255LIY,"These are amazing actors. Unfortunately, it makes my disappointment that much worse. Glenn Close is no Katherine Hepburn, but she's wonderful in her own right.  Had she gone after this role in her own way (rather than attempting to conjure Kate), Lion2 could have been slightly more successful. I kept waiting to see the haughty and diabolical Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil [Dangerous Liaisons], but she never showed up.  Heck, Patty Hewes from Damages would've made a fabulous Eleanore, too (although Patricia wouldn't exist for a few more years).  Patrick Stewart should've killed this; he's perfect for the role. But at least he attempted a different flavor of Henry. Instead of O'Toole's cantankerous bluster, Stewart's Henry was infinitely more weary. There didn't seem to be a shred of victory left in him. An interesting choice. His delivery of the Lear comparison and 'deciding which peasant gets a cow' forces us to change our view of the salty old king. Not as much fun to watch, but I suppose that was the point. Notable: Rafe Spall (son of wonderful character actor Timothy Spall) has his father's fearless approach to being revolting. His version of loathsome Prince John actually left Nigel Terry in the dust.  Spall single-highhandedly kept this from being a 1-star review.  Also, Jonathan Rhys Meyers was a delicious young Philip.  Nothing will compare to the original 1968 Lion. But if you like historical costume dramas and it's a rainy Sunday afternoon, this will do.",1317427200,2,1486,5.069672131147541

For me, even though Hepburn won an Oscar and O'Toole was nominated, the dialogue was ""over-acted"" in the 1968 production. In this version the dialogue flowed more freely and seemed more natural. Perhaps the costumes and scenery were not as authentic as the earlier version, but to me it was more visually pleasing. I purchased both versions and I'm sure I'll watch both again.

2062964,3,B000255LIY,"When I was a kid, my high school put on a rendition of Henry V that I actually was pretty impressed with...until I happened to watch Kenneth Branagh's movie version and realized that my school's drama teacher had just lifted all the major elements straight out of that, and told his students to copy those actors' performances.  I never went to another school play after making the discovery.

I have had a similar difficulty with Glen Close after watching this movie.  The O'Toole and Hepburn version is on my very short list of very fine movies, so it didn't take me long to discover that Close was just marking Katharine Hepburn's performance from beginning to end.  She did absolutely nothing original with the role.  I'm so disappointed in her!

On the other hand, I must congratulate Patrick Stewart for creating a version of Henry II that is subtly but profoundly separate from Peter O'Toole's.  He's quite a different man actually: his words have different emphasis, his actions different motivations.  It must be very hard work to stay out of the shadow of such an excellent predecessor, as Close's failure demonstrates; but then again Stewart has had plenty of experience at this in the Royal Shakespeare Company.  I've never seen him in one of those roles, but will definitely try: I was that impressed with his work in The Lion In Winter.

In the end I simply can't recommend this movie to others unless they have first seen the 1968 version so they will know what to be impressed with.  Also Stewart's and O'Toole's interpretations of Henry inform each other when experienced side by side, and together help round out a very complex fictional character.

Oh, also this version is quite a lot better LOOKING than the 1968 one.  I'm thinking the costumers had actually been looking at some 12th century miniatures.  At least in terms of color.",1268524800,,1854,4.807570977917981

The problem is, he has his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine in prison, and she and their three sons Richard, Geoffrey, and John, are all thirsting for power.  The King is growing old (he was to die in 1187) and he wants his youngest son John to succeed him.  Eleanor's favorite is their oldest son Richard, while the middle boy Geoffrey is biding his time and waiting for his chance.  Adding to the complications is the presence of Princess Alais of France, who was supposed to marry Richard but who has become King Henry's mistress, and her brother King Philip of France, 18 years old but already a master of intrigue and deceit.

While this version lacks some of the fabulous chemistry and sparkle provided by O'Toole and Hepburn, it makes up for it by the deeper, more somber interaction of Stewart and Close.  This version doesn't make me laugh as much as the 1968 version does, but it definitely has an even deeper sense of gravitas and irony.  Both dramatizations are superb, and my advice is to buy both and watch them on successive nights.",1228435200,3,1486,4.796078431372549
2062966,5,B000255LIY,"I had nearly worn out my original copy of Lion in Winter.  I am a huge fan of Patrick Stewart, but had no idea this copy existed until I looked to replace my run-down vhs copy.  As much as I love Patrick Stewart's work, and have all the faith in the world in his ability to bring out the best and the worst of characters, this would be a test.  How could anyone (even Patrick Stewart and Glenn Close) compare with the phenomenal performances of Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn?  They couldn't, and they didn't.  What they did was to recreate the roles in a style entirely their own.  The script is essentially unchanged.  The sets are a bit more elaborate.  The performances are spectacular.  I think Patrick Stewart managed better to create his own Henry than Gleen Close did with Eleanor.  I should have liked to see Close really open up and not try so hard to meet the standard set by Hepburn.  The early going has a lighter approach the the original version.  I don't think that the chemistry of the first film could ever be matched.  In the end, however, the characters play well off of each other.  When Patrick Stewart unleashes the force of Henri's grief, the effect is absolutely wrenching.  For the cast, overall, I think the only role I repeatedly missed in this performance was Anthony Hopkins' version of Richard.
In every way as dramatic, as painful, and as entertaining as the original, this ""new"" Lion in Winter is definitely a keeper!  If I had to choose now which performance I prefer, I doubt I could.  As a matter of fact, I now own them both on dvd.",1228089600,4,1574,4.485915492957746

2062968,3,B000255LIY,"Anyone who's viewed the classic original ""The Lion in Winter"" understands the fabled nuance and timing of the greats Hepburn and O'Toole. Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart are exceptional contemporary actors, but they fall short in the witty repartee so evident in the original ""TLIW.""

The supporting cast members are barely worth mentioning (with the exception of the exquisite Jonathan Rhys Meyers-his portrayal of King Phillip is genius in its coy, cloying, emotionally manipulative aggressiveness). The actress who played Alais was utterly irritating with her grating accent and flouncing (as opposed to gracefully walking). The sons, Richard and Geoffrey, did an admirable job (although Richard showed a bit too much angst at times-he appeared to be an immature teenager instead of a grown man). Geoffrey had fine moments, but John was an absolute disaster! What should've been a character with a childish devotion to daddy dearest came across as an imbecilic moron.

This ""TLIW"" can't hold a candle to the original both in character depth, production design (it's a medieval castle-why is it so sparkling fresh and clean?) and direction. This was a 2.5 star effort (truthfully based on the widespread appeal of Rhys Meyers).",1214179200,6,1229,5.297435897435897
2062969,5,B000255LIY,"Last week I had the pleasure of viewing for the third time the original Lion in Winter, and decided to check out this newer version. See my review of the original, which of course I rated 5 stars as well, for my thoughts on that. IMO,the new production is different. Not better, not worse, just different.
Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart are both fine actors who are well suited to playing their roles as royalty. Both turned in subtle, restrained performances that do credit to both themselves and the play, never allowing overbearing grandness and arrogance to obscure the humanity of their characters. Having read widely on the subject of their lives, I believe that both Eleanor and Henry were consummate power players, capable of using either bullying or beguilement as the situation required. Close and Stewart display emotion from one end of that range to the other. It's often said that love and hatred are opposite sides of the same coin, and that is certainly apparent here, between husband and wife as well as parents and children.
The supporting cast in the new Lion is also strong, though you have to wonder if the original John was really as worthless and repulsive a toady as he appears on screen.(Eleanor was certainly correct in her assessment of his kingly potential!) The other production values are stunning, with accurately researched costuming and good contrast between the richness of the interior and the dirt and squalor of the exterior settings. It was striking to watch for the servants, who performed their duties nearly invisibly, as would have been expected.
This is a movie worth watching, though a tolerance for talk over action is required. Goldman's  dialog is timeless, every bit as witty, stinging, and touching as ever.",1201219200,10,1756,4.952542372881356
2062970,5,B000255LIY,I have long been a fan of the original version with Katherine Hepburn but I am sorry to say that Glen Close is amazing in the role.  She is rivoting on the screen.  Strongly recommend!,1188086400,,184,4.228571428571429
2062971,5,B000255LIY,"As much as I struggled to see this 2004 production without comparing it to the 1960's classic which starred Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn, Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Terry, and Timothy Dalton, the shade of the earlier, better film kept intruding into my thoughts, so let me get the comparisons out of the way here in the beginning. Yes, the `60's version of The Lion In Winter is the better of the two movies, though I also rate this `00's version five stars and don't hesitate to recommend it as an addition to anyone's DVD library. It's a fine, artsy, stunning piece of witty drama that depicts the murderous side of the an irreparably dysfunctional nuclear family, circa 1183 AD.

That out of the way, let me say that the 2004 film was far more visually colorful than its ancestor, its sets grander, the twelfth-century more detailed, the recreation of the high era of the Age of Faith was notably loving in the hands of its superb crew. This motion picture was as gorgeous to look at as it was to watch. (Meaning the human cast often took bottom billing to the sheer might and intricacy of the setting.)  If only the actors had held up their end as well, this might have done the near-impossible and surpassed all recent on-screen presentations of the Medieval world.

Sadly, the weakness lies in The Lion in Winter's casting and acting. Patrick Stewart, a masterful thespian with a commanding voice, a great actor under most circumstances, was, I'm astonished to see myself write, among the most glaring trouble spots in the presentation. Stewart was simply wrong as Henry II. He chose to portray England's most volatile king with a light, comedic merriness that delivered a great man as an unbelievable braggart. And though no Hepburn, Glenn Close was also sub-par as Eleanor, yet I found her a better match for her part than Patrick Stewart was as Henry II. And was it just me or did it often seem Close was trying to give her best Hepburn impression in this role? Better a good Close than a bad Hepburn, as an acting coach might say.

A cast member I did enjoy watching was Julia Vysotsky, as Alyse, sister of the king of France, mistress of Henry, the father of her one-time betrothed. Vysotsky is a lovely Russian actress who did a French accent well and played her part with the right mix of delicate vulnerability and covert viciousness, one moment decrying her circumstances as a pawn in the game of politics, the next urging Henry to exterminate his sons then and there on Christmas Day. Male viewers, lesbians, and assorted connoisseurs of the female form will be pleasantly surprised at her topless scene and find it a plus that it came so close to the start of the movie.

The one person I truly wish had not been in this movie at all is Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, as King Philippe Auguste. I have liked this actor well enough in other roles, notably the one in Woody Allen's Match Point, but here Rhys-Meyers plays one of France's great monarchs while looking like some sort of post-modern Jesus and acting like a present-day Hollywood enfant terrible. The way he repeatedly releases his seething ""take-me-seriously-damn-you"" anger makes him seem bratty and silly, unlike Timothy Dalton's handling of the part in the 1960's production with his frigidly contained hatred of the Plantagenet's being a distantly frightening thing to behold. Rhys-Meyers did have a brilliant moment, however, when he is seen smugly chuckling to himself from his chair across the great hall of Chinon as he watches Richard and John, two future kings, bickering over who will succeed their still-living father, and one can all but read Phillipe's mind as his notions of Gallic superiority are once more reinforced. In witnessing the pettiness of the two rivals, Philippe becomes all the more certain that to attain his eventual victory over England, all he need do is outlive Henry, and wait...

Another brief but impressive moment unique to this version of The Lion In Winter came early on when the camera panned back from a by then emptying great hall to show Henry's crown lying alone on a table, and it was striking how up close the object of so much ambition looked like such a small battered thing unworthy of all the fuss over it, as if someone somewhere was commenting on what a paltry thing a kingship is.

A final, smarmy note is that the cast of the 2004 Lion In Winter was nearly all English, and I expect this was made so in order to lend a certain authenticity to a story set among feuding claimants to the English throne, and yet the irony is if authenticity was sought, French accents might have been more apt, since Henry, Eleanor, and their sons, including the fabled Richard the Lionhearted of Robin Hood fame, were all French, not English, and even the setting for the play, Chinon Castle, is in France, near the Loire River. (And still standing to this day.)

The 2004 version of The Lion In Winter stands well on its own but suffers in comparison to its predecessor. It's worth the long run time and contains some nice moments. It's visually appealing and in a few moments does get a little boring, but I think anyone who loves this ingenious story and the period in which it's set will quickly forgive these flaws. I'm glad it was made, and I'm glad I got to see it after having it on my list for several years.",1184198400,5,5326,4.6705756929637525
2062972,2,B000255LIY,"I gave this version of this excellent play two stars solely for the quality of the staging but this film is SLOW. While it is well acted, with excellent cinematography and set design, the director has done a very poor job because it drags and drags and lacks any of the crispness of the original.  In fact I didn't even finish watching it.  Close and Stewart played Henry and Eleanor as truly estranged enemies who were sincerely plotting each other's destruction.  This may have been closer to the historical truth (but who really knows?)but it simply wasn't fun or interesting.  The play rests entirely on the repartee between Eleanor and Henry and the rapier wit of the two but alas this was missing in this version.  The entire film was stagey and filled with pregnant pauses which killed the pace and wit.  The Hepburn O'Toole version is much better because it is filmed in a more intimate way plus Hepburn and O'Toole play the characters as truly loving each other but people who cannot stop being King and Queen with totally different agendas.  The Lion2 was a big disappointment.",1177459200,10,1087,4.71957671957672

2062974,1,B000255LIY,"I'll admit that I'm a huge fan of the original.  Having said that, I did try to watch Lion2 without prejudice.  However, it was so bad that comparisons were just inevitable.  One disclaimer:  I couldn't finish watching this movie.  It was that bad.

The plot itself:  Yes, there were some changes but nothing major.  Some of the speeches were done in different places in the original (most of Geoffrey's lines).  I didn't find anything wrong with that at all.

Patrick Stewart as Henry II:  I really only got this movie because of him.  I love him as an actor and his roles are always played well.  Except for this.  His lines were delivered flippantly.  He played it like it was a tongue-in-cheek rendition.

Glenn Close as Eleanor:  Her acting was just bad.  She didn't seem to care about anything either.  It was as  if she memorized the lines but didn't understand what they meant, so the delivery was flat.  The lines needed a underlying venom or bite that was sadly lacking.

The boys:  Richard was just bad casting.  He was a weasely looking guy and he just came across as mean and surly.  There was no range with this character.  Geoffrey was close to right.  In his case it was just that he wasn't John Castle.  Prince John was just plain bad.  You could actually tell that he was  trying to act.  He was supposed to be a snivelling schemer, but the guy who played him in Lion2 played him as a buffoon.

Actually, throughout the movie the actors  were either quoting their lines by rote or they were fumbling along.  There was no FEELING anywhere or for anything, yet the events that transpired were supposed to be vitally important to all of them.

In the original, you could feel the love/hate between all the characters, especially Henry and Eleanor.  It was palpable.  In Lion2 there really is no emotion.

As some have already stated, you could see that this whole production was done on a hollywood set.  The original was dark and dank, like you would expect a medieval castle to be.  In Lion2 everything was fairly bright and cheery.  It set the wrong mood.

To sum up, on it's own Lion2 is just not very well acted.  Compared to the original, however, it's a travesty.  I would suggest skipping this one and seeing the original.",1165881600,14,2245,4.5465994962216625
2062975,5,B000255LIY,"I have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968. Granted, that version is marvelous.

I have bought both versions and love them both. OK, it is difficult not to compare when watching.

BUT I can't help wondering: if this version would have been the first I or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version, if people would have been complaining about that version?

I can have different versions of Vivaldi's four seasons can't I? Actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all (and I do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other). We would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version, would we? I have gone to the opera numerous times and watched Don Giovanni three times. Every time with different performers. Remake? Absolutely not.

I think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it, because is such a great play. So, logically this would not be a remake!

Why can't we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other (splendid 1968) version when doing so?

That done, I must say I understand why Alais is in love with king Henry. Patrick Stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses  very well. He is a  very good match to Close's queen. I did not care for Richard, I thought he was not commanding enough, bit whiny. I think John is a difficult part to play to say the least and I didn't care for him either, too much the idiot. Geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good. King Philippe: too much a boy, although he has moments when the interaction with king Henry makes him interesting. Alais:good enough.

Which of the versions do I prefer? that is difficult. I have highly enjoyed both. I think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of Hepburn and I prefer her to Close. This version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic (Alais and Henry) approach.

I definitely prefer Stewart to O'Toole, who seemed too young for the role. I liked the way Stewart made us see Henry's  self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming (that is, until the end, when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart). O'Toole had a very serious approach all the time.

On the other hand: Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton were both splendid. I think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast.

Which of the versions I watch, depends on the mood I am in. I think they are both good in their own way.",1162512000,6,2646,4.430927835051547
2062976,3,B000255LIY,"""Of course he has a knife, he always has a knife, we all have knives! It's 1183 and we're barbarians!"" The genius of James Goldman's perfect script for The Lion in Winter is the way it takes great historical figures and not only makes them all-too-recognisably human but also makes their faults serve as the world in microcosm. And it does it with wit, drama and genuine emotion as its two titans battle each other with a great hatred born of a once great love while their unlovely brood jockey for position and the crown of England in an ever escalating web of one-upmanship and betrayal. As such, it's foolproof and virtually idiot proof, the kind of thing that not even a talented director could ruin. Unfortunately one of the reasons the play has been so rarely revived is because it also managed to spawn a film version so close to perfection for all its budgetary limitations and technical faults that it must seem pointless to anyone to attempt to match it. So it's no great surprise that Andrei Konchalovsky's 2003 TV version leaves you feeling a bit like you've brought a ticket to the hottest show on Broadway only to find that the entire cast has gone down with food poisoning and the rep company from Des Moines will be taking their roles for tonight's performance.

The biggest problem is that all these people have all too obviously seen the 1968 movie and fail to make the parts their own. Patrick Stewart fares best, but he lacks Peter O'Toole's delivery or comic timing although, to his credit, he doesn't try an impersonation. Unwisely, Glenn Close DOES slip into the odd spot of mimicry of Hepburn inbetween the odd half-hearted bout of Norma Desmond, but she makes surprisingly little impact until the second half of the game. Jonathan Rhys Myers' King Philip is especially weak, alternating between appearing stoned out of his skull (anytime he is required to stand or cross the room) or an unpopular school prefect in a school play. Indeed, there's too much of the Sixth Form Drama Society in Henry and Eleanor's loathsome litter. John Light takes what honors are available in that field as the unloved and unloving Geoffrey, but his competition is beyond merely light: Andrew Howard growls with more gravel than gravitas as Richard while a painfully incompetent Rafe Spall manages the impossible to turn in an even worse performance as an infantile John than Nigel Terry. Yuliya Vysotskaya's Alais is a somewhat better actress than Jane Merrow but far too East European to convince as a French girl and far too limited to make the part more than a cipher (but then, as Mrs Konchalovsky, her casting would appear to have been a deal breaker here).

It's not bad - the superb writing carries it through even when the performances falter - but despite the bigger budget you get that distinct Saturday Matinee Dinner Theater feeling.",1159920000,8,2852,4.771255060728745

I thought Glenn Close was every bit as good as Katherine Hepburn - they are different actresses of course, but I admired Glenn Close's performance just as much.  I really liked Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as King Philip -- his performance is excellent.  And I appreciated the way all the characters delivered their lines in this teleplay - for the most part, their delivery was natural, and the words flowed like actual conversation; less like a ""play"", with more reality.

BUT. I had a problem with Patrick Stewart's performance.  It's good enough, as far as performances go. I kept trying not to compare it with Peter O'Toole's, but I missed that triumphant bellowing, that presence, the ""oomph"".  I thought Patrick Stewart was a little too down-key - perhaps too reserved.  He has such a marvelous voice, I would have liked him to use it to its best effect. In the quiet scenes, he's OK, but he really needed to turn on the juice for the anger, the hurt at John's betrayal, etc.

Unfortunately, I didn't care for the actors who played Richard, Geoffrey and John.  None of these performances stood out, except perhaps the Geoffrey character was successful in showing the hurt he suffered from his parents' ignoring him all his life.  He was twisted (as he's referred to in the teleplay) by this neglect, and at least a viewer has a sense of that from this performance.  But on a whole, the actors who played the sons in the 1968 film gave much better performances.

I can't imagine anyone present-day doing a better job than Glen Close, but she can't quite, and King Henri doesn't make the cut either. They have no power - as characters or as people.  I agree the sets aren't as good either.  They manage to make some of the lines even sound silly.  The one thing that's marvelous in this version -- FAR better -- is the King of France.

A remake of THE LION IN WINTER, the 1968 masterpiece starring Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn, is such time.  Nothing in this movie comes remotely close to the original.  In taking the role as Henry II, Patrick Stewart continues a line of miscasting messes that have included his trying and failing to best Gregory Peck's Ahab in a remake of MOBY DICK, and trying and failing to make a credible Ebenezer Scrooge while falling well short of George C. Scott's masterful portrayal in A CHRISTMAS CAROL.

Glen Close is just awful! When compared to Katherine Hepburn, Close is like having a tuna sandwich when lobster is on the menu!

2062994,2,B000255LIY,"There are a few things in life that are perfect.  The 1968 original of 'Lion in Winter' is one such rare thing.  Why remake it at all?  There was only one way such a project could compare to the original: badly.  The brilliant flamoyance and radiant light that burst from O'Toole and Hepburn are missing here.

Instead we have a Patrick Stewart who fails as Henry II for the very reasons he succeeded as Aelius Sejanus in 1977's 'I, Claudius' and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on the Star Trek: Next Generation.  He simply is not the right man for part of this type.  Especially after the genius of O'Toole's 1968 performance.

This remake is a perfect illustration of what separates the good (even the very good) from the great.  The icy precision that made Glenn Close such a delicious Marquise de Mertuil in Steven Frear's 1987 'Dangerous Liasions.""  But Eleanor of Acquitance was no cold, scheming machine.  She was a woman of strong passion and appetite, every inch the equal of Henry and the superior of all other men around her.  In the chaotic mess of the 12th century she shines out as a shining beacon that West was reawakening.

Close's emotional scenes seem more histrionic than accomplished.  The dignity and gravitas that made you ready ""suspend disblief"" for the original, simply isn't here in this version.  I'm not saying Close is hamming it or overacting.  She's trying to imitate things Hepburn had and she doesnt.  It doesn't work. Katherine Hepburn, as Close did with the Marquise, has forever cemented that role as hers.  No other actress could or has done it justice.  Even more so Eleanor of Acquitaine.  It's not a fault, it's a question of charisma.  Close is now, arguably, our greatest living actress.  But this part is not hers.

Further she and Stewart lack the chemistry that O'Toole and Hepburn created so magnetically.  In the original, it seems like a window in time; suspension of disbelief was easy with Hervey's gritty, low budget direction then.

The real failure is the supporting cast.  They get an F.  Minus.  No, I won't be that harsh, but they are simply less than B actors.  Even the 'Bend like Bechkam"" star who plays French King Phillip Augustus comes off as doing a bad Joaquin Phoenix impersonation a la 'Gladiator.'  They simply aren't up to snuff.  Julia Vsotsky (Alais) seems to struggle with Goldman's still noble lines.  She lacks the heart-rending beauty of the original Alais and the acting skills.  The rest seem to struggle with delivering lines period.

In all, as it had to be, a disappointment.  Calling it ""solid"" is generous in the extreme.  The movies rises close to the origianl only in a few scenes in the second half; I leave to judge which ones.  Only in these does the suspension of disbelief take hold; only these few scenes do we forget we're seeing acting and become immersed in the story.

As I said, this movie illustrates the good from the great.  Patrick Stewart is a good actor.  He's competent and thorough; can anyone else imagine another as Capt. Picard?  But he doesn't have the charisma or elan of O'Toole.

Close, a truly great actress, is simply miscast.  Some challenges shouldn't be met.  The performance is a misfire and, in this film at least, she captures none of the scene-stealing glory of 'Dangerou Liasions"" or the unforgettable collapse at the end of that same movie.  Here, her skills simply don't work.

Stick with the original.  It's still one of the greatest films of all time.  This remake, however, is not.  And, it simply wasn't necessary.  The first was a complete vision, nothing was missing, no improvement could be made.  And, it it isn't.

I also note that this was Executive Produced by Stewart and his estragned or divorced wife, Wendy Neuss (a STNG producer).  One wonders if this disaster lead to another.

2062995,4,B000255LIY,"The 1968 screen version of THE LION IN WINTER (Lion1) is the most excellent film I've ever seen, or likely will see in my lifetime. But, I've a lot to say about various aspects of this new version (Lion2), so I'd better get on with it. I'll make an effort to be evenhanded.

First, a concise history lesson in the context of the film.

King Henry II of England is also overlord of Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and half of France. Henry keeps his wife Eleanor, the Duchess of Aquitaine and the former first wife of King Louis VII of France, under house arrest in Salisbury Castle for revolting against him. In better times, Henry and Eleanor had, in addition to three daughters, five sons: (in order of birth) William, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, and John. William died at age three. Henry, the anointed heir, died aged 28 in the summer of 1183. It's now the Yuletide season of that year, and Henry II is holding Christmas court at his French stronghold, Castle Chinon. (To be accurate, there's no record of a Christmas court at Chinon in 1183, but that's irrelevant to the essential theme and tone of the story.) Joining him are his surviving sons and, released from confinement for the festive occasion, Queen Eleanor. An aging Henry wishes to cement his succession. His favorite is John. Eleanor's is Richard. Geoffrey, nobody's favorite, maneuvers to get what he can. Complicating the gathering is the presence of Princess Alais and King Phillip II of France. Alais, Louis VII's daughter by his second wife, was betrothed to Richard by treaty between Henry and Louis when she was but a child. Alais has been living at the English court for years, and is Henry's mistress. (Author Sharon Kay Penman in her book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devil-s-Brood/dp/B001RNI1UU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devil's Brood</a>&nbsp;effectively argues against Alais having been Henry's mistress. But, no matter; it adds to the film's plot.) Phillip, aged 18 and King since 1180, is Louis VII's son by a third wife. Phillip either wants the marriage of Alais and Richard to take place, or Alais's dowry, the French province of the Vexin, back. Phillip hates the English monarch, and will use Henry's sons against him any way he can. The holiday skullduggery is so thick as can be pierced with a backstabbing dirk.

The music score is positively anemic compared to John Barry's original. Of particular note in Lion1 are the vaguely menacing ""Main Title"" that serves as introduction to the destructive passions in the plot, the elegant ""Eleanor's Arrival"", which accompanies her regal progress up river by open boat to Chinon, and the finale - ""We're Jungle Creatures"" - that underscores the approaching end to Henry's reign, but the beginning of the great Plantagenet dynasty.

Costuming and sets are too pretty and finished. In Lion1, the interior of Chinon is gloomy, cold, rough-hewn, and smoky (from the torches) - perhaps to be expected in a 12th century pile. And the clothing, even for the royals, wasn't elegant by any stretch. (My favorite scene in the original has Henry casually throwing on a crown and royal cloak over otherwise plain garb before striding through the mud, dogs, chickens and peasants in the castle courtyard to greet the arriving Phillip.) In Lion2, the costumes are too fine and the castle interior, especially the main circular staircase, is too obviously a film set.

The dialogue, perhaps the best ever heard on the Big Screen, is virtually the same in the two productions. However, the nuances from facial expressions, body language, and timing raise Lion1 to the realm of the sublime.

The scripted action is also pretty much identical in both, except for three unnecessary sequences: an opening scene of Eleanor's failed rebellion in 1174, a silly shot of Richard riding his horse up Chinon's circular stairs, and another of Richard attempting to escape house arrest by rappelling down Chinon's walls.

And how about the acting?

In Lion2, Yuliya Vysotskaya as Alais is at least the equal of Jane Merrow's original. Indeed, Yuliya presents as a slightly stronger personality, and it doesn't hurt that she resembles a blonde Audrey Hepburn. And the new Phillip (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) does a different and perhaps improved take on a relative youth striving to be a King in the face of the formidable and street-wise Henry, whereas Timothy Dalton in the role came across as a bit sinister and with the unscrupulous venom of a misplaced older man.

Rafe Spall as the latter-day John occasionally overacts, in my opinion, almost to the point of parody, unlike Nigel Terry's right-on portrayal of the sullen youngest Prince. John Light is relatively light-weight as the contemporary Geoffrey compared to the sardonic and clever schemer revealed by John Castle. Andrew Howard as the new Richard, whatever the real-life man may have been like, didn't strike me as Lionheart material. The superficial trouble was the actor's unimposing voice. Anthony Hopkin's Richard, I think, would've wiped up the floor with the new guy.

Lion1 starred Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn as Henry and Eleanor. Both received Oscar nominations, and the latter won her category. Only in the last third of Lion2, with Patrick Stewart as Henry and Glenn Close as Eleanor, does the power of their paired performance achieve that of Peter's and Kate's tour de force. Stewart and Close seem too amused with the familial dysfunction of their characters, almost playing them for laughs, especially in the early going. Whatever humor the audience perceives in the dialogue - and there's much, the real Henry and Eleanor, and O'Toole and Hepburn, squabbled over the succession with deadly seriousness. Also, Lion2 portrays both as white-haired ancients. In fact, Henry was only 51 at the time, though Eleanor was 11 years older.

Had I not seen Lion1, I would've given Lion2 five stars. But the former is so superlative in all respects that I cannot.

Finally, let's return to the historical record. An aged and weary Henry, perhaps the most energetic of England's monarchs, died of illness in July 1189, two days after being forced by the allied Richard and Phillip to accept humiliating terms ending a war. Richard succeeded to the throne, married Berengaria of Navarre, and was followed by John in 1199. (Geoffrey had died in 1186 in a tournament accident). Eleanor survived until 1204. John lost virtually all of his father's vast French holdings to Phillip. Alais returned to France to wed another.",1093046400,140,6531,5.082089552238806
2062996,5,B000255LIY,"I just finished watching this.  This is so much better than the 1968 movie.  Patrick and Glenn are much closer in age than the 1968 version.  Even though Henry was younger, he wasn't that much younger than Eleanor as portrayed in the 1968 version.  Both actors gave a 3D performance and their range and depth of character was incredible.  Patrick is a dynamic performer and Glenn was certainly up to the challange.  This performance is also complete.  The 1968 version is a scaled down version of the play. Both characters were much more in line with history.  My wife, a historian, is a direct descendant of Eleanor and Henry and this performance was indeed scrutinized.  If you want a classic, get the 1968 version.  If you want the real thing, get this one.  You won't be disappointed in the powerful performances of ALL of the actors.  It is a true emsemble of performers playing off of each other in an intense and rivoting way. This performance kept me on the edge of my chair continually.",1091491200,6,995,4.622857142857143
2062997,3,B000255LIY,"The original Lion in Winter is one of my all time favorite films, which is odd because, except for rare occasions, I never much cared for either Katherine Hepburn or Peter O'Toole.  So, when I saw this new version of the movie on the movie rental shelves, I was rather excited as I like both Patrick Stewart and Glen Close a lot.

The film was, unfortunately, a disappointment.  Close and Stewart both do well, their timing isn't as impeccable as O'Toole's and Hepburn's, so the film loses some of it's humor, but they do manage to make the parts their own.  Jonathon Rhys-Meyers is VERY good as King Phillip and better, in fact, than the original. Also better than her original incarnation is the actress who plays Alice (I'm not sure if that's the correct spelling of her name), she's much stronger than the original girl and makes her role more important.

Where the film really fails is in the boys.  First of all none of them seem to have any relationship with their parents.  The first film had the feeling of a family squabble over the holidays.  This one is more of a love story between Close and Stewart with Alice in the middle.  The boys and Phillip seem incidental and though that is the point of Phillip's character it should not be so of the brothers.  Also, how the boys are played is a problem.  Richard is not likeable and though it's mentioned that he writes poems and that is played up in his character is the war side.  When Henry claims Richard was the best I'm a bit dubious as in this version Geoff seems to be, which also shows a failure in how the film makers percieved Geoffrey's character.  I think perhaps they felt sympathetic towards him because no one loved him, but I feel no one loved him for a reason, which never comes across in this version.  As for John his main problem is just that the actors to old to be believable in the role.

The other main problem with this version is that it's soooo slow.  It takes ages for it to get its audience interested and even then it just sort of meanders towards its conclusion.  I don't know if this is the fault of editing or what.  I know at the beginning it's the fault of too many scene changes, a problem with which most play-to-movie adaptions are fraught.

I'd also like to say that the computer matt-paintings for the outdoor shots and exterior shots of the castle are just awful as is the case in everything Hallmarks has made since and including Gulliver's Travels.  This is a problem that's easy to overlook, however.

Ultimately, the movie is interesting despite being slow and it's fun to watch Close and Stewart especially towards the end.  The best scene is credited to Close in which she's trying on her jewels after her first defeat and she joined one by one by her children.  She really made you feel for her.

I've given the movie three stars, which, to me, means it's definately worth watching once, but not buying.",1090972800,15,2909,4.486692015209125
2062998,4,B000255LIY,"This dark historical drama set in 1183 is a far cry from most of the 2003 Oscar Nominees and Winners, except perhaps for Master and Commander and Girl With A Pearl Earring,two historical dramas. It concerns King Henry II of England who meets with his jailed wife, three ambitious sons, and the new King Philip of France at Chinon in France over Christmas to decide the accession to the throne and the dividing up of Henry's considerable lands among his heirs. There is considerable conniving among the lead characters, since the stakes are so high, and neither the mother nor her three sons are very loyal to their father. Eleanor of Aquitaine was particularly noteworthy for siding with her sons in their claims against their father. Various plots and alliances are hatched while the unfaithful Henry continues his affair with young Alys, sister of the French King, whom he offers as a pawn in his game of divide and conquer.
  I found this to be a stimulating remake of the Katherine Hepburn film,which I haven't seen. Both Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart seem highly involved in their roles throughout. Eleanor in the course of the dialogue reviews the course of her marriage with Henry II from her teenage years when she was married to the King of France and possibly slept with Henry's father. Their rocky relationship has its ups and downs in the course of the film, ending on a positive tone. But there are scenes with Eleanor insulting her husband's masculinity as he contemplates taking a new wife to produce an heir, for example, claiming he has no sons, and she also threatens him with the distinct possibility that at one time she slept with his father. At times Henry seems to favor his youngest son John, and Eleanor favors Richard, but these alliances do not last and eventually all three sons end up in the dungeon. If you have tried to enjoy Shakespearean drama but have found it somewhat inaccessible, I think you will enjoy this film which is quite accessible to the general public. Of course it helps to have some knowledge of history.",1090540800,3,2055,4.737430167597766
2062999,5,B000255LIY,"This version of the play ""Lion in Winter"" is actually a little better video than the 1968 movie.

I own the play book, the O'Toole/Hepburn 1968 movie, and this Stewart/Close 2003 video. I expected this to be an ""almost as good"" and was shocked and supprised that I like it better.

Actress Glen Close especially faced a challenging job of living up to Hepburn's epochical performance, and achieves it. The improvement to the play from her performance is similar to all the other actors' in this video: their characters are shown as slightly vulerable and hence more believable.

This 2003 'Halmark' production is a little better in that the psychology of the characters is a little more subtle and better brought out. O'Toole/Hepburn/Hopkins focused a little more on the verbal knives and daggers, less on the wounds. The acting by Close/Stewart/Howard and the rest of this cast leans more towards the hurt felt by the characters from eachother's barbs, something that's a needed emphasis to make the interactions such a long practiced dysfunctional family believable - I expected that the characters would have all hardened solid, years ago.

The only performance that I found somewhat difficult to adjust to was Andrew Howard's portrayal of Richard, compared to Anthony Hopkins'. Howard shows a much more convincingly human Richard, but not as kingly ""lion hearted"" as Hopkins'. In 1968, perhaps because he was worried about portraying a sympathetic gay character, Hopkins played a Richard who is the obvious choice for the next king. But that made Hopkin's presentation of Richard's moments of humanity in the play - when he is overcome by his love for his mother, or his ex-lover, Phillip - are less believable than Richard as played by Howard. Howard's tortured Richard is clearly soft under his armor, and the vulnerable scenes seem natural. But I perversely missed the comic-book ""Good King Richard"" on the screen while watching Howard play Richard as fully human.

I haven't seen anyone play Geoffrey in a way that satisfies me yet, but I think that could be a flaw in James Goldman's writing of the character.

Rafe Spall's body is a superior casting choice in this movie. I hope Spall will forgive me, but he looks the part of the slob; all the better to portray ""Bad King John,"" which rightly reduces the intensity of his lines. Unfortunately the director over-did the visual metaphors with the pigs in the end-of-video barnyard scene. It was a waste of screen time and an insult to Spall's already excellent portrayal of the spoiled youngest child.

There are other small visual clues that show moments of tenderness or affection between characters in this video, such as a fond glance between Philip and his half-sister Alais, that greatly help the story, which is otherwise so overloaded with family battles that the audience can forget that there is such a thing as a healthy, loving relationship. Another improvement is the rhythmic appearance of Eleanor's bodyguard; the actor portrayed vigilant loyalty so well, and without a single line, that he deserves to be listed in the credits. His performance serves again to show that good relationships are possible - where would Eleanor be without someone she could rely on to kill people in her way and then hide the body?",1090368000,6,3285,4.972677595628415
2063000,1,B000255LIY,"I try to evaluate a movie like this on two sets of criteria: 1. Is it a good adaptation? and 2. Is it a good movie, in and of itself?

The answer to both questions, in this case, is no. The original movie's dialogue was delivered with such impecible timing and sarcastic, sharp wit that you could actually believe these folks WERE Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The onscreen chemistry between Peter O'Toole and Catharine Hepburn was off the charts, and the supporting cast, including a very young Anthony Hopkins, was superb.

In this remake, Patrick Stewart (who I always regarded as a great actor) and Glen Close (who I never did) seem to have about as much interest in their dialogue as a toddler in a calculus class. They sound so scripted and deadpan that it's hard to believe they weren't actually reading off of cue cards (perhaps they were). They barely, as far as I could tell, even make eye contact with one another.

Steward does a decent job roaring at, loving and hating his family. Glenn Close does at time seem to channel Hepburn for the iconic lines, but she holds together well. I have seen some criticism of the youngest sons portrayal in this film, but i believe he was scripted that way from the start. If you like the overall story you will be ok with this film. If you are a devotee of all things in the older film you will will be left wanting that, but you will feel they respected it. I feel the original film loomed a little too big in this production.

8022313,2,B000255LIY,"The original 1968 film of The Lion In Winter is, to say the least, a tough act to follow.  Starting with its cast -- Peter OToole as Henry II and Katherine Hepburn as Eleanor of Aquitaine, supported by young newcomer Anthony Hopkins as Richard the Lionheart, and future James Bond Timothy Dalton as King Phillip.  Add to that the guiding hand of director Anthony Harvey, arresting photography by Douglas Slocombe, the finest score John Barry ever wrote -- and the fact that the film was made in the 60s, when when British cinema was at a popular and artistic peak.
 Any good play is worth a second adaptation, but this new production proves a disappointment, and lacks the compelling intensity of the original.  The performances, on balance, are very impressive.  Patrick Stewart is fabulous in the role of Henry, and he brings more of a fuzzy uncle quality to the character (in contrast to OTooles biting, rough-hewn characterization).  Henry is 50 when this story takes place, and whereas OToole was in his late 30s when he played the role, Stewart was in his 60s -- and therefor closer in condition to that of a 12th-century 50-year-old.  Henrys weariness and desire to find peace flows more convincingly from Stewarts performance, and this Henry is one the viewer can more readily identify with.  (All the same, OTooles remains the slightly more interesting performance.)
 The other standout performance of this production is Julia Vysotsky in the role of Alais, and she is the one thing in this production which actually outshines the original.  As played by Jane Merrow in the 1968 version, Alais was was the least appealing character -- wishy-washy, spineless and hopelessly dwarfed by the sheer presence of her costars.  Vysotsky however plays Alais as a passionate, feisty spitfire, and invites more sympathy, and respect from the viewer.
  Glenn Close is a fabulous actress, but as Eleanor I find her somewhat stilted (and I could swear at times shes doing an impression of Kate Hepburn).  The rest of the cast offer fine, solid performances.  As Phillip, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is superb, and this adaptation of the play addresses the homosexual relationship between Phillip and Richard with a bit more candor than the original.  As Richard, Andrew Howard is very good, but I can never quite get Anthony Hopkins disturbing portrayal of the future king out of my mind.
 Despite the high-quality effort from most of the cast, this film just fails to captivate the viewer, and is bereft of the *energy* that resonated from every frame of the original.  It never really draws the view in, and is also, quite frankly, boring much of the time.  I'd say part of the problem is that this film is very dependent on the use of language, and English is not director Konchalovskys native tongue.  One frequently gets the sense he doesnt quite grasp the meaning or subtext of the dialog, and cannot therefor guide the actors accordingly.
 Even today, the original 1968 version of Lion in Winter has barely aged at all, and remains as powerful and compelling as when it was first produced.  While the efforts of the cast in this new version are laudable and sincere, I  would nevertheless recommend the original.",1491696000,,3207,4.88724584103512

This is a film that is probably more for the die hard fan of history or historical fiction cuz that's really where this film would be categorized historical fiction most of the plot did happen in 1183 but in my opinion the playwright takes some serious liberties with the history like implying that Richard I and Phillip II of France had an ongoing homosexual relationship or that Henry II had an actual physical altercation with his sons. I also thought the playwright's portrayal of the future king John I was really bad because they make him appear like he's mentally challenged and while he may have been a bad king, he wasn't mentally retarded. It makes for an interesting film but if you're looking for something authentic and more true to life then this film isn't for you.

I saw the older version when it came out, just out of my 20s, and have seen it dozens of times since. Less than two months ago I showed some friends my new DVD of the 1968 Hepburn-O'Toole version (I've had the VHS for years.)  I consider it the 3rd best movie I've ever seen--behind only Sergei Bondarchuk's never-to-be-matched 7-hour WAR AND PEACE (from my favorite novel) and Alejandro Jodorowsky's violent exposure of the real meaning of the cowboy movie mentality, U.S. imperialism, EL TOPO.  But THE LION IN WINTER is in an honored 3rd place, and all three are way above any other films I really like.

My friends agreed that the casting of all those still-admired actors and their acting couldn't have been better, and that John Barry produced the only really superb musical score of his career.  I admire Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart as actors, but who could possibly replace John Castle's snaky portrayal of menacingly angry Geoffrey (sorry that this actor usually appears on stage), really young and skinny Timothy Dalton, long before FLASH GORDON and JAMES BOND, holding more than his own as one of France's most beloved kings, Philip II (whom the French nicknamed ""Augustus""), Nigel Terry doing an over-the-top Prince John which fits the dialogue perfectly, and who could guess the he's really handsome and would become King Arthur in EXCALIBUR?  What a pleasure to see the great and versatile Anthony Hopkins in his youth doing a bluff, arrogant Richard the Lion-Heart and reminding us that the best Army commanders, from Leonidas and Alexander the Great to William of Orange, are often gay. These sons were perfect! So were Katharine Hepburn in her finest mature performance, and Peter O'Toole in his best ever--and young Jane Merrow, who never got another challenging role but admirably became Princess Alis.  The witty dialogue had my friends falling off their chairs with laugh-tears in their ears, since this screenplay is the best satire of a dysfunctional family with too much power, and somehow even makes us empathize with these barbarians.  Since I believe the screenplay remains the same in the newer version and the leading actors are outstanding, you won't be disappointed if you're not as involved in the 1968 film as I am.
