Earth launches a rocketship to the approaching alien planet carrying Flash Gordon, Dale Arden, and Hans Zarkov on a mission of peace.  They are immediately attacked and crash land on the alien planet of Mongo.  Follow their adventures as they team up with Thun leader of the Lion Men, Prince Baron of Arborea, Ming's daughter Aura, and King Vultan of the Hawkmen as they defy Ming's army and fight terrifying monsters to try and save the Earth.  This video presents the first three episodes of the 1979 animated series THE NEW ADVENTURES OF FLASH GORDON, including ""Chapter One: A Planet In Peril"", ""Chapter Two: The Monsters Of Mongo"", and ""Chapter Three: Vultan, King Of The Hawkmen"".  The episodes have been edited together for a one hour length adventure.  This is the first time I have seen this series since I was young, and it is everything I remember.  All of the design work is very reminiscent of the original Alex Raymond comic books, as well as later works published by Al Williamson.  The animation and voice acting has very striking similarities to the eighties HE-MAN series, but that is because it was made by Filmation Studios.  Ming sports Skeletor's unmistakable voice for goodness sakes!  Very well animated for its time and worth owning.  Unfortunately, the quality of the VHS edition released by Rhino isn't that good (it is actually a copy of the VHS PAL releases from the United Kingdom), but it is the only way you will get to see this rare gem.  Hopefully more will be released some day in the future!  Don't miss out!",1043193600,3,1697,4.727891156462585

The animation that is used in this cartoon is way ahead of its time, I also think that it is more adult oriented.  You have Ming's daughter and Dale Ardin dressed in very skimpy attire, especially for a 1980's animated series! The series I'm thinking of, and I believe this is it, goes through different chapters of Flash, Dale, and Dr. Zarchov, who crash land on the alien world of Mongo, where they must battle the evil Emperor Ming, in an attempt to save earth.  A well told, and exciting series that I would to own today....",995500800,4,609,4.278260869565218
