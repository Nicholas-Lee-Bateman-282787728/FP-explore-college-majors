8287231,5,B001CDVUS0,"OK DVD on 1950s nuclear fallout media. Has some fun 1950s footage. I showed it to my 11th grade class. Perhaps 50's kids bought off on this propaganda but my class didn't. I really wanted more complete 1950's coverage... film, music, news, culture, growth of America. But, this was a fun little DVD.",1264032000,,299,4.660377358490566
