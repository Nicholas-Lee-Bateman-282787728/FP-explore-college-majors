5635038,5,B00BJB2GSS,This film was just what I was expecting! I ordered this for an American Popular Culture: The Sixties. Good price with fast shipping.,1394064000,,132,4.782608695652174
5635039,5,B00BJB2GSS,A classic. Still looks fresh. An Original.  a must see for any real film lover. Love all of his work as a Dop and as a director.,1393718400,2,128,3.740740740740741
5635040,5,B00BJB2GSS,I still have a VHS of this (that may have different music in one spot than the DVD). It's always been a favorite. I originally bought it while researching the turmoil that took place in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Forster went on to be the bail bond guy in Jackie Brown; need to IMDB what he did in between.,1386374400,,335,4.419354838709677
5635041,5,B00BJB2GSS,"If you want to understand politics of the time from the viewpoint of anti-war protesters and those who did not care for ""the establishment"" then have a look at this scarce movie. It is all about perspective. I somehow suspect that many here who do not like this movie are the ones who resented the progressive movements of the times and have just found another outlet to take out their hostilities. Abbie Hoffman is dead and they can't pick on him anymore, so they knock the film. Maybe, maybe not, it is not a great film but it is very unique and unlike much of anything else you will ever see and it is worth a look.",1378339200,6,618,4.2905982905982905
5635042,3,B00BJB2GSS,"This is quite a movie. The transfer to dvd is clear, the subject is potent and the cinema verite aspects are irresistible. So, why only 3 stars? Because Criterion continues to release movies in English without closed captioning. Am I really supposed to understand Verna Bloom's West Virginian dialect? Robert Forster (a marvelous actor who has rarely gotten his due)speaks fluent Chicago, so he's easier to understand. But,listen up Criterion, closed captioning is standard now for all the plebeian dvd distributors. time for you to step up.",1377648000,6,541,5.2298850574712645
5635043,5,B00BJB2GSS,"A hard to find classic of the counterculture now available on a superb transfer by Criterion Collection.

Includes segments of the amazing ""Look out Haskell, it's real!"" documentary on the making of ""Medium Cool"" (unfortunately not the entire film).

A perfect companion to Criterion's box set ""B.B.S. Story"".

Well worth the purchase.",1376611200,2,335,5.403846153846154
5635044,2,B00BJB2GSS,"This is an utterly boring attempt at mixing in some of the personal dramas of the 1960's, and it fails due the fact that it's so inhumane and dry.  The distinction between what is ""real or staged"" is blurred, think Guy Debord (Author of The Society of the Spectacle) or French d&eacute;construction, but for the viewer, there's no sense of immediate attachment.  There's some pertinent messages and critiques against the fascist police state, but other than that, it's a tedious watch.

I like the package Criterion Collection has put together, but this film is vastly overrated.

In some ways, it resembles all the equally tedious Billy Jack films after The Born Losers (1967).",1375142400,2,678,4.9734513274336285
5635045,3,B00BJB2GSS,"I eagerly jumped at the chance to get this DVD because I have fond memories of seeing it when I was young. Viewing it today I learned that the film had not aged much less gracefully than I have. It's still an interesting concept but it seems very dated today and works best as a nostalgic snapshot in time. It would be difficult for me to imagine someone who didn't live through the 60's to get much of this, but it's certainly worth a viewing if not necessarily a purchase.

I've been waiting for release of Strawberry Statement as well but after seeing this my enthusiasm for that has admittedly waned a bit.",1373241600,,610,4.398230088495575
5635046,5,B00BJB2GSS,"This film was at the time of its release overshadowed by Easy Rider.  But  this film was not only a brave experiment by Haskell Wexler, it was an accurate representation of the times.  The improvised dialog captured the concerns of the people and filming in the actual riot was incredible.  A very good document of the times.",1370476800,7,325,4.649122807017544
8569589,3,B00BJB2GSS,"Sometimes you get your hopes up to see a movie; a movie that will be seen and ""read"" like a document like a good documentary should while informing the viewer on an important topic, especially a political 'document'.
MEDIUM COOL, to my surprise, does not attain enough of the importance of said document to be praised as ""must see"" viewing.
Haskell Wexler's acclaimed film (may) have made it's first minor mistake by combining a fictional story or two with the Actual presence of the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago (1969).  The fictional addition to MEDIUM COOL revolve around a single mother who leaves West Va with her 13 year old son to relocate in Chicago (her husband has been sent to Viet Nam).  The mom (played by Verna Bloom) meets local tv reporter (Robert Forster).  The tv reporter finds local stories with the help of his camera man (Harold Blakenship).  This is where the documentary feel of the movie stems from his/their news stories while filming and interviewing people.  There is a ""black perspective"" lecture scene that screams for political correctness, circa 1969.

But, the eventual conclusion of this ""important"" document combining fact and fiction ends with a question mark, of sorts.  Something happens to the fictional characters in this real ""documentation"" eventually filmed during the actual riot of The Democratic Convention.  I guess it doesn't matter what happened ""exactly"" to these people because they were  fictional characters.  Waiting 110 minutes for this partial conclusion resolution to MEDIUM COOL left a bad taste in my mouth.
I guess I've been conditioned to see movies - even documentaries - end in a specific fashion.
It could be from watching too much  tv -- a MEDIUM COOL news representation of the real world -- that has 'conditioned' me to expect movies to end without so much question?
Yes, the camera shows a tv camera man (in the movie) whose lens turns and points at ME!  The movie viewer!  Telling me something about myself.  I guess I need a more on hands approach to politics.  That, and I'm more a voyeur than a participant.  Yep, I already knew/know I watch too many movies.  Thanks for reminder Haskell.  Your cinematography was surprisingly conventional in MEDIUM COOL, too (especially for you).
Anyways, MEDIUM COOL is actually a 3.5 star viewing experience at worse.  There is some 'serious' originality here, for sure, even if it is slow and a bit (it seems) disjointed by what are a couple of oddly placed flashbacks.
I'm not sure I have much more than a MEDIUM COOL interest to watch this one again.
Xtras including booklet and Interviews with cast and Director help to give more local history of the times surrounding the making of MEDIUM COOL.",1486684800,,2730,4.921397379912664
8569590,5,B00BJB2GSS,"Way ahead of it's time, melding cinema verite with fiction. A groundbreaking film that any student of the cinema or the 1960s should see. Use of wild sound instead of voice over and foley adds to the feel, fortunately the camera sound was well dampened.  Some of the dialogue is stilted, but considering that the use of unpaid extras and footage shot with the actors engaged in the DNC protests in Chicago makes this film one to  be enjoyed for the simple fact that this type of film will never be able to be made again.",1485907200,,520,4.40625
8569591,5,B00BJB2GSS,"The amazing thing about this movie is that Verna Bloom, who will later appear as the mother searching for her son among the rioting Chicago police, is shown in the opening scene where the journalists are arguing about the difficulties of their mtier.

She couldn't possibly be in this location at this time. Yet it is certain that Wexler did this intentionally.

I see this as an inspiration on his part, arising from his extreme commitment to the story.",1485129600,,454,4.734177215189874
8569592,5,B00BJB2GSS,Having been involved in the anti-war protests at the Democratic Convention in Chicago back in 1968 this movie was especially important to me. Very well done. Remarkable combination of a fictional story with the truth of a documentary feel to it.,1473379200,,245,5.0
8569593,4,B00BJB2GSS,"Quirky, visually arresting film--Haskell Wexler changed filmmaking with this film.  Disturbing at times but a classic relic of late 60s filmmaking.",1463011200,,147,6.0
8569594,5,B00BJB2GSS,"This movie would define prescience for me.  How does someone making a movie in Chicago during the Democratic convention of 68 have the foresight to film using such as a background for his points about film.  It's really genius, it's tight.  Never seen anything like this Cinema Verite, le mot just!  It's fun just seeing old footage of Chicago, let alone prescient clips the director made.",1423440000,,389,4.848484848484849
8569595,5,B00BJB2GSS,"The film holds up, the transfer is beautiful and the extras are great.",1412985600,,70,4.461538461538462
8569596,5,B00BJB2GSS,"It's just getting worse, we now have a police state and death squads are eliminating mental defectives and black people. You pipe what the police are doing to the people in Ferguson?

The message of this exceptional film is... Why can't we communicate without being beat up? Our leaders have way too much power over us, whenever this fact is brought up our leaders simply exert their power to put the people down with violence and terrorism.

We protested Reagan's iran contra conspiracy, no one listened police beat people up and things just got worse.
That same secret government did 911 and now has more power than ever before!!!",1407974400,3,632,4.7889908256880735
8569597,4,B00BJB2GSS,Great film but needs closed caption for hearing impaired.,1407974400,2,57,5.444444444444445
8569598,5,B00BJB2GSS,"In addition to the storyline, the cinematography made this movie incredibly appealing. Medium Cool provides an insightful experience into the late 60s; the infamous Democratic convention, the onset of Black Power...very interesting for those of us who were unfortunate to be born after the fact. Not too keen on the ending (kind of leaves you suspended in mid-air), but Robert Forster is at his best in Medium Cool.",1401148800,,415,5.117647058823529
