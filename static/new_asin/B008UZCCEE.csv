8530688,1,B008UZCCEE,"You will not get the version of Life narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Instead get a dumbed down, talking down to you version by Oprah. So you have half great documentary, half garbage not worth wasting your time with.",1377734400,,220,4.666666666666667
8530689,1,B008UZCCEE,"The Frozen Planet series in this two-pack is wonderful, intense, and engaging. Attenborough's at his best narrating.

However, the Life documentary comes in two flavors. One narrated by David Attenborough, the other by Oprah Winfrey. The Winfrey version reads like a second grade class. ""Watch out, here comes the fox!"" I'm not kidding. It's that dumb. The Attenborough narration is not condescending. It's accurate, concise, and infused with Attenborough's innate enthusiasm and knowledge of the subject matter. How Winfrey, someone with zero science training, ended up narrating in place of Attenborough who has a degree in the natural sciences is something I will never understand.

Anyway, the version of Life int his two-pack is the Winfrey narration even though the picture clearly shows Attenborough's name. I don't know what's up with that, but I sent mine back because Winfrey just ruins what is otherwise a great series.

This is very disapointing especially since I've pointed out the error to Amazon and they've simply ignored me. The image of this item still shows the Attenborough version of Life.

If you really want both of these documentaries, order them separately and demand the Attenborough version.",1361145600,11,1219,5.300518134715026
