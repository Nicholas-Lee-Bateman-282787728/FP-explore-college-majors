8738434,4,B01793BEZK,"This is a ""church movie"" which should be seen by everyone, although it is not for everyone. Only so many who see it will me changed by it. It is a story of transformation, repentance, conversion and - ultimately - redemption. Jesus Christ the Lord is the central, though unseen character here. I watched the scenes unfold as a fashion photographer and a model are brought to the brink of destruction, then miraculously changed by the New Birth.
The performances are uniformly good to SAG professional, the HD camera picks up details on the well-lit interiors; the editing is fairly tight and involving. I saw this feature film on The Big Screen at its Red Carpet premiere in Delay Beach, Florida in December, 2014 and have been awaiting the DVD release so I can send copies to fellow-believers. I hope it will be soon! I also hope and pray that more folks who attended the first two showings will review it here on AMAZON and at imdb.",1459555200,,934,4.598802395209581
