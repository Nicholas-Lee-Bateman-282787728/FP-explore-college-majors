8510606,2,B0075KJM0C,The movies are great. The DVD's are in perfect condition. The case is NOT in perfect condition. The case is smashed and broken and every time I open the case all 3 DVD's fall out. Only a matter of time before the DVD's are damaged from falling out all the time.,1509926400,,261,4.137254901960785
