8306723,5,B001GQO53A,I purchased this for myself.  I enjoyed watching Viv Pinata's when they were on Saturday morning cartoons.  All the characters were great.  I liked the fact that I can by this for my collections.  It is fun and entertaining for kids of all ages including their parents.,1368403200,,269,4.659574468085107
8306724,5,B001GQO53A,"Personally I'm puzzled why Viva Pinata didn't make a bigger splash.  The original video game for the XBox 360 was excellent, and the tv series brought the lovable animal management sim characters to brilliant life.  There are some whacky characters here, and fun situations.  The CGI is competent and looks better than a great deal of its competitors from the same time period.  A cute television tie-in and a great gaming series, and this still couldn't get off the ground.  This is still fun however...

You get quite a few episodes here, and kids seem to enjoy the show.  It does have its humorous moments, and it is one they replay over and over again.  They quote parts of the show such as ""...saw a chewnicorn trying on bowling shoes.""  Cute, harmless fun, that has a few lessons along the way, but not so heavy handed that it tangles up the entertainment into a lecturing mess.  The Pinatas are crazy, and that's a big chunk of the fun right there!",1329350400,,955,4.564705882352941
8306725,5,B001GQO53A,"I wanted to purchase this because I LOVED the show when it first came on TV in 2005-2006 and I missed it tremendoulsy when it was taken off the air here in the US(It still airs in Canada).Once in a while,certain digital cable companies will air some episodes for about a month and a half,I grew tired of waiting & was lucky enough to find this DVD and its one of the best purchases Ive ever made on Amazon. I also own 4 of the Viva Pinata video games so this was a must-have for me. Its VERY much worth more than what I payed for it and I happily wouldve payed more it was also in great condition. No damage to the DVD and the case now I can happily watch 10 of the best episodes of this wonderful tv show whenever I want to :)",1318896000,,727,3.9523809523809526
8306726,5,B001GQO53A,"The Viva Piata series is finally being released on DVD. The Piatas Must Be Crazy And Other Stories DVD only includes 10 episodes from the first season. I guess Shout Factory thinks we want to buy several DVD's of the series in order to get an entire season. Besides that the series is greatly animated and entertaining. I like how the style of the animation kind of has a Tex Avery feel to it. There are no special features included in this DVD. You get the option to just 'Play All' episodes or go to 'Scene Selection' and that is it. No deleted scenes, storyboard art, commentary, no nothing. Despite this, if your sick of having your only option to watch this 4Kids hit on YouTube in poor quality this DVD is your best alternative.

Episodes Include:

1. Cocoadile Tears
2. Candiosity
3. Queen For A Day
4. A Chewnicorn In The Garden
5. Legs
6. Horstachio Of A Different Color
7. Whirlm With A Dream
8. The Crush
9. Trojan Horstachio
10. The Piatas Must Be Crazy

Running Time: 110 Mins. General Audiences. 2007-2008 4Kids Entertainment.",1235174400,5,1040,4.550802139037433
8306727,5,B001GQO53A,Viva Pinata (now off the air) was the best Saturday morning cartoon out there. The stories were always fun and the 3D artwork was always excellent. I always looked forward to seeing the adventures of Fergie Fudgehog & his pals every weekend on Saturday mornings. The plots were centered around the pinatas having to go to parties to be bashed for their candy but somehow Fergie figured a way out but not before a lot of crazy stuff happened. I'm so glad the series has a DVD out now so I can replay some of my favorite moments of the show. Really great cartoon.,1235174400,3,561,4.403846153846154
