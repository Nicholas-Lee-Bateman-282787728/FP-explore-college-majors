8726505,5,B012SEF5FK,"If there has been or will be a super Bruckner conductor it has to be Daniel Barenboim! I thought the Bruckner he did with the Chicago Symphony was great stuff, but these videos and the orchestral playing are certainly on par if not better! The brass playing is superb. And the audio and video quality is excellent/ I hope somehow they release the recent Bruckner 7-9 they filmed at Carnegie Hall!. Do not hesitate to get anything that ""Danny"" conducts, especially Bruckner...his love of this music is really obvious and it gets translated into beautiful performances of this often neglected masterpieces! Bravo Danny!",1489795200,2,617,5.0
