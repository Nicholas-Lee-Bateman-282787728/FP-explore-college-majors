7884459,4,6305180512,"Ophelia is probably the first record where Natalie Merchant is completely in control of everything. Her first solo album Tigerlily was good but it seemed as though Natalie was holding back. Now, on Ophelia, she completely lets loose and this video is a wonderful companion to the epic album. Natalie isn't exactly a capable actress and I hope she never gets further involved in acting, but the amount of passion and heart she put into this project makes you forget that she isn't an actress. Natalie is simply telling the story of Ophelia from another perspective and this video more than works. I have never been so fascinated with an artist like I have with Natalie. Her records don't soar to the top of the charts and she isn't on every magazine cover, but she shares with us what she does best, which is creating beautiful and inspiring music.",996019200,2,847,4.691275167785235
7884460,5,6305180512,"""Ophelia"" is a unique and beautiful display vehicle for this artist's unfathomable talents.  Using a word from her hit, ""Carnival"", I was mesmerized by the blending of her caricatures with the fluidity of her tantalizing voice.  And then, she gives even more of herself, by including enchanting visuals to some of her early hits, including ""Carnival"", ""Jealousy"", ""Break Your Heart"" and ""Kind and Generous"".  This video is worth the price of your soul! UPDATE APRIL 2012:  Just got my third copy of this vhs (having donated the other two years ago) and it is even better that before.  Still availabe in vhs, and not in DVD, that I can find.  Sound and visuals simply excellent - especially the sound through my tuner and speakers.  The backup artists, actors and technicians all deserve your applause!  If you still have that old vhs laying around collecting dust, well there is life after!  Get this and experience while you can.

7884461,5,6305180512,"The video complement to Natalie Merchant's ""Ophelia"" takes a rich and well-produced album and reconceptualizes it.  By portraying seven European and American women from different periods of the recent past,  Merchant challenges her listeners to retrace the threads between each song  in a way that very few artists have ever accomplished.  Most impressive is  Merchant's implication that all women share an innate ""Ophelia,""  an often troubled-but-resilient part of one's personality.  In terms of  content, Merchant's lip-syncing of foreign languages and inclusion of  ""out-takes"" and shots of the make-up room illustrate that she  acknowledges the inherent pitfalls of trying to step into seven different  pairs of shoes, which I think are minor obstacles that thankfully did not  deter Merchant and directors Frank Woodward and Mark Seliger from  completing this intelligent video.",937094400,9,884,5.707692307692308
7884462,5,6305180512,I thought she did a wonderful job on this video and captures a rare personalside to her. All I can say is that shes thebest and I cant wait for whatever is next,931478400,2,160,3.878787878787879
7884463,5,6305180512,"Natalie Merchant brings the characters on her CD to life on the ""Ophelia"" video. She is an extremely talented artist.",929664000,,117,4.9
7884464,4,6305180512,"Merchant has put together a fun, entertaining -- and yet thought-provoking -- companion to her ""Ophelia"" CD. Richly designed and lushly photographed, ""Ophelia"" the short film is a journey through seven  or so different characters Merchant creates as she goes along. Sometimes  she reveals herself as an able actor, sometimes not, but she is always  poetic. That's the strength of the film -- Merchant adorns it with the same  inspiring, emotive prose as her lyrics.  Simply put, if you're a fan of  her music, you'll like the video. I doubt Merchant is trying to win new  fans with the video, and she probably won't, but she has created a great  souvenir for her admirers; the four music videos (""Carnival,""  ""Break Your Heart,"" ""Jealousy,"" ""Kind &  Generous"") alone are worth the price you'll pay.",913680000,3,798,4.932330827067669
7884465,5,6305180512,"After about the sixth viewing of this interesting video, I've fallen in love with it. If you're a fan of Natalie Merchant at all, you should really consider buying this. Miss Merchant's originality, cleverness, and talent  are all shown off here. Along with the 22 minute short film, are five music  videos. 2 from Ophelia and 3 from Tigerlily.  The short film is very  interesting. And as I watch it, I begin to realize what I think Miss  Merchant wants us to get out of it. That in every person there are many  different sides, many different personalities within..  It's a  beautifully done, well directed piece of work. Natalie is charming and  humorous. I highly recommend this.",913593600,6,683,4.769230769230769
