7952512,4,B00005RI7K,"This ""bare bones"" title takes the viewer on a journey to the Argentinean badlands of Patagonia wher Drs. Rudolfo Coria, Jorge Calvo, Rachael Rao, Luis Chiappe, and Carlos Munoz share startling discoveries. At Aca Mahuida, teams found the plains littered with fossilized egg shells, which further exploration revealed to be the world's largest known dinosaur nesting ground. Here, scientists not only discovered fossilized embryos enabling them to identify thedinosaurs as Titanosauruses, they also were able to learn more about the dinosaur skin, growth patterns and mating habits. Other sites featured here include Rincon de los Sauces, La Buitrera, and El Chacon, where paleontologists have stumbled upon a highway of dinosaur footprints and the skelton of Gigantosaurus, the largest carnivore presently known (an estimated 145 feet in length). At the various dig sites, paleontologists explain how these 80-million-year-old clues are combined to create a pre-historic portrait of the mighty lizards. While the graphics are not as flashy as you'd find in the Walking With Dinosaurs titles, the excellent content combined with the opportunity to witness up close on-site exploration more than compensates (not to mention the fact that very few other titles focus on the international dig sites). Extra features include ""The Tiniest Giants"" exhibit tour by Dr. Luis Chiappe at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in California, where he discusses the findings at the Aca Mahuida nesting grounds.
This is highly recommended by Video Librarian.",1044835200,15,1555,5.53781512605042
