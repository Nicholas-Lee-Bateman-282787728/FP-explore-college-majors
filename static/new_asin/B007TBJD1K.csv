5109765,2,B007TBJD1K,It would have been nice to see someone else besides Fiona Bruce in her unflattering outfits walking by herself down all those long corridors.,1342569600,10,141,4.916666666666667
5109766,5,B007TBJD1K,I was captivated during the entire video.  Worth watching several time. I agree with the other reviews and would like to add  Queen Mary's doll house is a must see.  Amazing. Next best thing to being there in person. 171 mins long. Intro by Prince Charles. And it is a few dollars cheaper now too.,1342483200,4,297,4.363636363636363
5109767,4,B007TBJD1K,I found this video series to be quite enjoyable.  I found the the part about Buckingham Palace to be particularly interesting as I haven't found much else on its history.,1342137600,13,170,4.666666666666667
5109768,5,B007TBJD1K,"I won't go on & on. I'm not that kind of reviewer, but I would like to share what I like about this DVD. I received ""Queen's Palaces"" for a birthday gift and I absolutely love this DVD.  We get to see inside Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle & Holyrood House in Scotland. Each segment was so well done by Fiona Bruce. She flowed through the rooms (she, appropriately styled as well), which made you think you were beside her. The history of the palaces and objects in them were so interesting, you didn't want the segments to end.  She made even George IV appear interesting explaining his differing decorating style with other sovereigns (including his mad & frugal father George III).  It was nice to get the history about Holyrood House, which we do not hear of often enough.  This DVD is worth every penny to purchase and keep in your collection. I hope they bring out a second companion to this series. There is so much more we can appreciate in the other houses. Well Done BBC & Fiona Bruce!  God bless the Queen & her family.",1341619200,36,1032,4.468085106382978
5109769,4,B007TBJD1K,"In this three part series, the viewer is taken on an excursion through three of the palaces that Queen Elizabeth II has as her official places of residence: Buckingham Palace in London, Windsor Castle, and Holyrood House in Edinburgh. Fiona Bruce escorts us through the history and lore -- always interesting -- of each palace in about an hour. I found the history of Buckingham Palace most interesting, with it starting as a swampy outskirt of London and a favoured hunting ground for Henry VIII and then as a country house for the Duke of Buckingham, and finally how it became the handsome residence under the guidance of Prince Albert. Windsor wasn't quite as good, but still interesting from the summer season when tourists flock and such as St. George's day. What was a surprise to me was the story of Holyrood House, and made me all the more keen to journey to the United Kingdom. But the big reveal here were the objects from the Royal Collection -- held in trust for the British people by the Queen -- that were shown, and the interesting stories behind them. History geeks will have a grand time with this. The only draw-back were the extended bits with Fiona Bruce, who played the 'Dig ME!' screen time just a little too long. Four stars overall.",1335830400,82,1256,4.63677130044843

5109789,5,B007TBJD1K,I saw this show and TV and bought the DVD.  It is amazingly beautiful and I loved looking at the art and decor of the different rooms.  I will go to these palaces if I get another chance to go to London and the nearby areas.  Well put together DVD and program.,1407024000,,260,3.9615384615384617
5109790,3,B007TBJD1K,"I admit I was tired when I watched this however . . .  The hostess drags on and on about the history of how the palaces were developed and shows just a few rooms.  She does discuss how some of the artwork and furnishings are acquired but most of the artwork that is discussed are portraits.  One clock and a few other items are highlighted but the topics are discussed in grand room views with focus on the collection furniture or otherwise. It goes into the history of how the occupants have or haven't used the castles.  The queen hasn't sat in the throne room since her coronation or the dining room where she entertains.

When I saw the dvd for the Russian Hermitage - see that review - it was extraordinary discussing the collections with fabulous photo detail and fabulous musical accompanyment.  This castle video put me right to sleep.  Its a good preview if you want to go and visit them but nothing more.  A bit dry like the British humor.",1403395200,,949,4.445086705202312
5109791,5,B007TBJD1K,"Explore the royal palaces like never before. Fiona Bruce guides you on a dashing tour, filled with juicy gossip about the royals, along with tours of their stunning palaces. Another smashing BBC production. Just buy it and have fun!",1402963200,,232,4.9743589743589745

5109793,5,B007TBJD1K,"If they focused exclusively on the palaces architecture, phases, past with save existing pieces of the actual buildings instead of those moments she wonders off to Venice at one point to talk about Canaletto it would be better. The buildings are amazing and the ""brain"" piece of art at Windsor was off point. Of all the pieces in the royal collection that is what they featured?!",1394928000,,379,4.757575757575758
5109794,5,B007TBJD1K,"the 3 castles featured in this video where outstanding the beauty of the interiors was amazing it made one wonder how could you live in such beauty
the history behind them is of interst and the dvd is well worth viewing",1386720000,,219,4.365853658536586
5109795,2,B007TBJD1K,"This series was an interesting idea that fell well short of its potential. While the history presented was fascinating (albeit shallow), the narrator and writer, Fiona Bruce, puts herself in the frame as much as the palaces she is profiling. There are seemingly endless shots of Fiona walking and gazing at objects, usually in a brightly colored dress that makes her stand out from the background in dramatic fashion. The camera, on several occasions, pans slowly from her feet to her head, giving us a full body view, as if she is the real feature of the show. These type of shots are so frequent that they quickly become silly and distracting. Not recommended.",1380672000,7,662,4.815789473684211

5109799,5,B007TBJD1K,"With the baby news I am certain people will be searching for info on the Queen, Monarchy, etc. If you are looking for info on the palaces this DVD will help you get started on your quest. Not the most extensive DVD of the palaces, but well done, informative, and a must watch for any Royal watcher if for nothing else than the occasional narrative from HRH Prince Charles.",1374537600,,372,4.405797101449275

I had the pleasure of touring Buckingham Palace 4 years ago and when you walk up the staircase before you enter the Throne Room and look down and then look up, all you can say is ""Wow!"".  I thought that he introduction by the Prince of Wales at the beginning was a nice touch because he would be as familiar with the as anyone else would.",1371427200,4,423,4.146341463414634

5109808,5,B007TBJD1K,I love everything about English History. This dvd went to three of the most beautiful and famous places in England and a bonus in Scotland. I liked everything about this dvd. Fiona Bruce is wonferful and makes this journey very personal. I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone who loves history. The places that  Fiona visits in this dvd are places the normal person could not have a more detailed tour than what is given in this dvd.,1360972800,,443,4.6075949367088604
5109809,1,B007TBJD1K,"I was so looking forward to viewing this series.

But, OMG, it is awful. Fiona Bruce - dressed in blue Saran Wrap - dominates. And this is not good.

She is OK as a narrator, and that should have been her role, while lovely scenes of the palaces are shown. Instead, we get a LOT of airtime with Fiona walking, walking, walking, talking, singing (I kid you not), and even sitting in a gondola in Venice. Yes, Venice. Of course Venice is wonderful, but I purchased the DVD to see the Queen's palaces. You know, in England and Scotland.

Was the director in love with Bruce?

I also cringed at the inaccuracies and the many many many missed opportunities.

The DVD should have been titled: THE INCREDIBLE FIONA BRUCE while she deigns to pay a bit of attention to some old palaces.

In short: a painful viewing experience. The numerous good reviews are baffling.",1360195200,33,858,4.538961038961039
5109810,2,B007TBJD1K,"Not enjoyable.  The whole documentary focuses on the narrator.  The viewer sees far more of her than the palaces.  Who's idea was that?  She has a very nice voice for narration, but she should have been heard and not seen!",1358640000,27,222,4.475
5109811,5,B007TBJD1K,This was a gift for Christmas and she loved it.  The DVD gives you a personal view of these amazing palaces.,1358294400,,108,4.142857142857143
5109812,5,B007TBJD1K,"When I have gone to Britain three times, I have tried to see all the palaces. And I have with some success. I have seen all but Buckingham; the Queen has never been at Balmoral when I visited. I bought books for all the palaces I visited and even for Buckingham as the gift shop was open. But, when I saw the Diamond Jubilee DVD of the Palaces occupied by the Queen I had to have it for the tour I missed.
It does not cover all royal palaces in Britain, but only the three major residences of the Queen: Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and Holyroodhouse in Scotland. But at a running time of nearly three hours, it leaves nothing out.
The narration by Fiona Bruce provides a nice, insightful wealth of knowledge of the palaces and trivia. The camera can go to areas of the palaces that are off limits to visitors even when open for tours.
Full of history and grandeur befitting a Queen, it is a lazy, easy way to tour these three palaces without lugging out the books. Great as a virtual tour or a souvenir...especially if you have always missed Buckingham Palace.",1357603200,,1067,4.4213197969543145
5109813,5,B007TBJD1K,"We saw two of the three episodes of this on cable over the summer; we missed the one on Buckingham Palace and really wanted to see it, so we purchased the DVD - it's beautifully done - high quality video and audio and a great gift for anyone interested in the history of some of the UK's most famous palaces.",1356825600,,308,4.15
5109814,5,B007TBJD1K,I love the history of these buildings and the entertaining way Fiona Bruce delivers information.  Seeing the buildings and hearing about their use now is also great.,1354752000,,165,5.111111111111111
5109815,4,B007TBJD1K,"While it was a thrill to see the inside of these palaces once again, this DVD could have covered more ground (making it even more interesting) by either extending the length of the individual features or cutting out Fiona Bruce whose bad strappy sandals with wooden (?) heels began to get on my nerves. Ah, yes, but our wee Fiona is a star, ennit?  And she'll not let us forget it neither. Shots of Fiona tramping the grounds, swishing along the corridors, grandly pushing through the mirrored interior doors, and (twice) opening the front doors to Buckingham Palace like she lived there both made me cringe and wasted valuable reel time.  The only interesting traipsing incidents were when she picked her way underground to the river Tyburn beneath Buckingham Palace and when she followed the secret stairway at Windsor. Oh, and did I mention that she takes up reel time by rendering a reedy version of a Mendelssohn duet?  Och! All this Fiona business is meant to make the documentary more human and less dry, but I found it an intrusion. I would have preferred a floating camera through these fairy tale palaces like I was discovering them by myself. Fiona could've done voice-over and rare brief interviews.

This DVD shows us a bare dusting of these three great palaces, and tosses in a few interesting facts, but omits some really fascinating bits, so the tours seem a bit fluffy, but they're better than nothing at all!  I, for one, would've loved a peek into the private living quarters, but I don't think anyone is permitted that.

When I visited Holyrood House I was amazed at the small size of the living chambers of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was herself a tall woman.  I suppose it made heating more efficient. During his murder, Rizzio was dragged down a short flight of stairs to a large chamber in which Mary used to receive delegates, and the floorboards there feature a sizable blood stain rumored to be his. This room now houses works of art, among which are two small but intriguing portraits: one of Anne Boleyn, and one of her sister, Mary, hanging in this gallery presumably because Anne's daughter, Elizabeth I, was a cousin to Mary of Scots.  I wonder these two works of rare art aren't shown more often in textbooks because the bewitching and playful smiles on the lips of the dark-haired sisters, coupled with their snapping dark eyes, make them look for all the world like really fun people to know and not so stupid either.  No wonder Henry VIII was attracted to them.

At St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, Fiona took us into the Choir stalls and while omitting mention of it, strode over the in-floor tomb of no less an historical personage than Henry VIII and his favorite wife, Jane Seymour. (Bending down to touch that tombstone gave ME chills of awe.)  Inside the castle proper, among the great art works is a full length portrait of Mary Queen of Scots often used in textbooks and biographies.  Since there weren't many portraits painted of her, it might have been interesting to see this one.

As for Buckingham Palace, the gilt work is overpowering in real life, and I was told it's kept up by a full-time team who start at one end of the palace and work through room by room until they reach the end, then go back and start again.  Amazing.

Remember, the Queen is in Scotland in August so Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle are open for tours in her absence. I managed to go through Holyrood House in September.  These are buildings well worth seeing in person.",1354320000,6,3506,4.648867313915858
5109816,5,B007TBJD1K,It arrived fast and was in perfect condition. I am interested in information on the Queen..I also liked the fact the Prince Charles spoke about it.,1352678400,,147,4.6923076923076925
5109817,5,B007TBJD1K,"I have always been interested in British Royalty and the palaces.  This DVD was very informative.  It showed the beautiful palaces and gave their history.

5109818,5,B007TBJD1K,"As a production, this DVD has excellent video and audio production values, and a quirky yet beguiling orchestral score.  If your Blu Ray player has decent upscaling circuitry, you will not be disappointed that this title is offered as a DVD only.  Presenter Fiona Bruce's commentary is conversational and cordial in tone, and she's the perfect counterbalance to the somewhat dry and academic ""talking heads"" who offer more detailed information for each of the venues.  The title sequence includes special effects which seem inspired by the Harry Potter films. I cannot judge whether the content is the last word in historical accuracy, but as a video tour of the palaces, with a crash course in English and Scottish history, I find this DVD to be superb.",1346112000,,754,4.968253968253968
5109819,4,B007TBJD1K,"This DVD contains episodes on three historic residences of English sovereigns: Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and Holyroodhouse (in Scotland). The tours are beautifully filmed. You will feel that you have visited, with your own private tour guide.

On the con side, the series would benefit by less Fiona Bruce air time and more from the many experts, who only speak briefly on the tours. In a few cases, Ms Bruce's comments are misleading and uninformed.

For example, when the purchase of Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical drawings by King Charles II is mentioned, it is not explained that the workings of the human body were being explored at this time, and there was a general fascination with the human body as a machine. So much so that public dissections were well attended events. The anatomical drawings would have been admired as ahead of their time, by King Charles II, who was very interested in science. The public interest in anatomy comes after the groundbreaking work of William Harvey on the workings of the circulatory system, in the early 1600's.

In another case, when the ceremonial dirk carried by George IVth, on his Scottish visit, is shown, it is not made clear that the knife and fork, also carried in the dirk sheath, were travel cutlery, though a rather extravagant knife and fork set, carried by all travelers of that time. Hosts were not expected to go to the expense of providing eating utensils to guests. Also in those pre-detergent days, many people preferred not to share their personal items with others, so most people carried their own knife and fork. The fork originated in Italy. English visitors to Italy carried the new utensil back home. In the 1600's, eating with a fork was considered a foppish affectation. From the Medieval period, the knife was used to cut up food, and pieces of food were conveyed to the mouth on the tip of the knife. By the time of George the IVth's Regency, the fork had become common place in England. Search for ""necessaire"" plus ""Regency"" for more information on the subject of travel cutlery.

All in all, I highly recommend the series, but take it with a grain of salt. I was surprised to find a couple of research gaffs in a BBC production. If you are truly intrigued and want to know more, visit several of the excellent sites on the web on various periods of English history--Elizabethan, Jacobean (James Ist), Georgian, Regency, and Victorian.",1344556800,6,2422,4.828915662650602
