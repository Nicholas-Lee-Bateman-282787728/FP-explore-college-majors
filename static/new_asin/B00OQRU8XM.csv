6759556,3,B00OQRU8XM,"Its ok, but not the same from the pokemon I grew up watching in the 90s. Right off the bat what really seemed like a big middle finger to the fans who seen it that long ago, they start the theme from the 1st movie only in this one they give like some Justin beaver pop remix bs and yes I call him Justin beaver. Fan girls go ahead and hate. I don't like him so what. Later in the movie I notice even more parts that seem to mock the 1st movie such as people getting turned to stone like ash from the 1st movie, people getting healed by pokemon like the 1st movie. All in all it was an ok movie, but after watching it, it felt like viz media was trying to mimic and copy stuff from the 1st movie that 4 kids did only worse. My point of view on pokemon is its starting to feel like its run its course and should stop at x and y. Its been around for over 20 years. Still great and all, but viz media is showing they are no 4 kids clearly and need to notice that.",1425600000,4,959,3.8241206030150754

6759558,5,B00OQRU8XM,"The DVD comes with the movie AND the theatrical trailer. A cute movie, definitely one of the better Pokemon films. As usual, no Japanese track, but that's to be expected.",1424736000,3,170,4.7

6759560,4,B00OQRU8XM,"Having seen this film when it originally premiered on Cartoon Network, while enjoying it; I did notice a few cuts were made for commercials. Thankfully, the DVD has the complete film in English; containing the missing scenes and elements (such as the full version of the XY remix of the Pokmon theme). On top of that, it's a solid first film for the XY series of Pokmon. Containing clashes between a group of thieves and the legendary Pokmon Xerneas and Yveltal, the princess Diancie must rise to the occasion to defend her kingdom with the help of Ash, Pikachu, Serena, Bonnie, and Clemont. The DVD also includes the short ""Princess of the Diamond Domain,"" which had not been previously brought to the US. I can easily recommend this DVD to Pokmon fans and families who may have been let down by the Cartoon Network version of the film.",1424649600,12,837,4.662162162162162
6759561,1,B00OQRU8XM,"Disappointed. When Cartoon Network aired this movie, I had heard they cut out like 15 minutes, including scenes in the trailer. (Whatever happened to those???) When I got this movie, it was THE EXACT SAME ONE AS THE ONE I RECORDED 4 MONTHS AGO. I want my $10 back.",1424217600,3,264,4.408163265306122

6759563,2,B00OQRU8XM,"Wow. The Pokemon Company has got to be joking. Their recent films have just been AWFUL! Only 60 minutes, LAME story with no real action, misleading trailers, and just awful plot. The first 30 minutes of this movie is NO action or plot. Just CONSTANT kidnapping of Diancie. Xrenus BARELY appears and there is very little character development in the new characters. Plus major plot holes. Like why is it one of the bodyguard Pokemon of Diancie can talk but the rest can't? Seriously, what HAPPENED to Pokemon?? I remember when Pokemon movies were AWESOME like Mewtwo Strikes Back, Pokemon 2000, Entei Spell of the Unknown, Pokemon 4ever, Pokemon Heroes...The only reason I give this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it had very good effects and CG.",1423180800,4,746,4.790697674418604

6759622,5,B00OQRU8XM,"I grew up with Pokemon. Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh were amazing. B&W was alright and didn't expect anything better from X&Y BUT I was so wrong. XY is so so amazing, it's different, it feels different. I love watching it and it's just great. Words can't describe how much I love it. The movie was also great; 10/10 recommend. Mega evolution is truly awesome. I'm super excited what XY will bring in the future.",1430265600,5,413,4.52
6759623,5,B00OQRU8XM,One of the better Pokemon movies. Well worth the money. I am really grateful that they included the Pokemon theme ( Gotta' Catch em all) XY. I was kind of worried there was just an instrumental. This movie stands out next to the last two as it gives Ash emotion and the voice of Diancie is not annoying but fits really well.,1429747200,3,324,4.241935483870968
