GHOST FROM THE MACHINE deals w/ the subjects of death and guilt, using a combination of science fiction and the supernatural to tell the tale.

I thought there was a little too much setup/background and it got a little too technical in the tinkering and workings of the machine. Also, I at first saw the actors as acting and not as the characters they played.

HOWEVER, then the movie picked up and went in a surprising and exciting direction. I also started relating to the characters and developing feelings for them. It turned out to be a really clever, poignant, heartfelt story. At the end, I even cried over the fate of the brothers. Ghost from the Machine is one of those that has haunted me ever since I watched it. (Keep thinking back to it.) It's WAY more than just a scary ghost story.

While it certainly contains a few moments that will make you jump, it's not a straight-up horror or supernatural thriller -- it's a complex supernatural drama that explores, through science, the pain of death and the joy of living, and the inverse of those emotions.  I give the filmmaker, Matt Osterman, a lot of credit for attempting a fresh take on the ghost story.  He obviously put some passion and intelligence into this project, and it shows. Keep in mind, it's definitely a low-budget movie, so expect some of the pitfalls that come with that territory (like the acting).

I can only imagine its the ones who are most likely used to loud drama, empty dialogue, action, and CGI type of movies which I call brain drain movies. This was an excellent movie dealing with hard issues; death. loss, loneliness, moving on, letting go, and healing. There was great acting here, and deeply thought provoking. One evening I had a dream with my Grandmother, she was calling me from a window in the clouds, no sound, same age, but a youthful glow, dressed in white while the wind was blowing white curtains around her. I was looking up at her, she gestured with her hands as if to come to her....I found out, after 2 years of having had this dream, she was dead for three years and I was not informed. (typical family drama) My Grandmother loved me so much, we had a great bond and relationship, I guess since they took us apart, she had her final say...I found her burial ground the next day 2 miles away from me. The soul does live...she was telling me she was no longer here. And her hands were gesturing to come to her...and when I arrived at her grave I felt this is what my Grandmother wanted me to see...the secret that was kept from me. She was gone, and she loved me so much she came to me in a dream to tell me herself she was no longer in the world.....""I'm here Grandma, I'm here"" is all I could say when I arrived at her grave site, and thanked her for loving me so much to come to me and tell me the truth.....",1426550400,,1502,4.200692041522491

I suppose the subject matter being what it is puts it in the horror category, namely the director's interpretation of the afterlife.  There aren't a ton of characters as this is clearly a very small budget film, but I found the actors quite convincing.  I'd have to say, however, that this film is probably hit or miss with the viewer.  I think it depends on one's mood at the time of viewing.  My life being where it is made me quite receptive to the subject matter I found certain moments in the film to be rather moving.  There are some who might thing I'm crazy for that but such is life.

When the husband saw his wife, I was surprised with his actions because he took it so well that his wife had returned.  That relationship brought tears to my eyes; I never react that way with any fictional story.  If you, like me, were doing another task besides watching the film, then this is for you.

4485327,4,B004W5MHIC,"Ghost from the Machine (Matt Osterman, 2010)

Last Tuesday (which as I write this was December 10) was one of those rare days when I didn't put a single foot wrong with my movie watching; everything that came off my Netflix queue ended up being pure gold. Of the bunch, my favorite was Ghost from the Machine, a low-budget thriller bursting with intelligence. It crossed my mind more than once that this is the movie Primer wanted to be and, in my estimation, never managed to become. So, needless to say, Universal is remaking it, rather than using the rights to push a film that deserves far, far wider recognition than it has so far gotten. Why do I get the distinct impression the remake, if it ever surfaces, will be dumbed down to the point where it'll be unrecognizable?

Plot: Cody (See Jane Run's Sasha Andreev)'s parents died in a car accident, and since then, he has had two obsessions: taking care of his younger brother James (Aberration's Max Hauser) and building a machine that will allow him to communicate with his parents in the afterlife. Of course, doing such things requires parts, parts, and more parts, and a certain combination of same brings him to the attention of Tom (Factotum's Matthew Feeney), who builds pieces on the side that Cody has bought through the store Tom sells them to. Cody's machine, with all the bugs worked out of it, starts doing what it was made to dowith results that neither Cody nor Tom could have predicted.

The great thing about Ghost from the Machine, like last year's similarly excellent Bellflower, is that this is a movie that Osterman could have easily taken in a generic sci-fi or horror direction, but instead, this reminded me a great deal of the wonderful little 2004 French film Les Revenants; Osterman instead focuses on the characters' reactions to what's going on around them rather than spending all the movie's time reveling in the wonderment of hey, look what we did, and how many CGI effects we used to do it!. This is not a movie for the stuff-blows-up crowd, which unfortunately limits its appeal to the broad market, but those who appreciate intelligence, empathy, and a great story will find this exactly the kind of thing they've been looking for all their lives without realizing it. ****",1388880000,3,2265,4.729113924050633
4485328,2,B004W5MHIC,"Wow. I don't even know where to begin with this. I guess I'll start by saying that I think I get it: the filmmakers were trying to show how the self-centered actions of the protagonist wrought his own tragedy. But man, by the 60 minute mark, I was wondering if the protagonist wasn't suffering from severe head trauma (well, I guess he was since he gets hit on the back of the head by a shovel). But his poorly thought-out decisions start even before this unfortunate run-in with the tool.

In fact, I can't help but wonder if the shovel is meant to not-so-subtly indicate that the protagonist is a tool himself. At every point where he could make a wise decision, he turns around and picks the one that will cause the most potential mayhem.

At the end of the movie, we have one of the characters berate the protagonist, ""All you had to do was get him to school!"" And we're meant to get the crushing weight of the tragedy that has befallen the protagonist. But really, you just laugh at this statement of the obvious and continue laughing as the end credits roll. I want my 96 minutes of my life back.

4485330,5,B004W5MHIC,"This thinking person's ghost story puts one in mind of the modern indie-classic, PRIMER, (famously shot for $7000). Though not nearly so head-twisting (it's not meant to be), it offers an intelligent plot surrounding the trials and tribulations of building an electronic device to accomplish the ""impossible"". The goal and its motivation are revealed to us slowly, a credit to the writers, as we spend a good deal of time wondering what drives our protagonist. The writing is sly - plot reveals come at odd angles, dialogue is oblique, and the scene construction is lean. Be warned that this style of storytelling eschews the modern staples (gimmicks) of jump scares and even jumpier editing. But its lower budget production values serve the style - confident, unadorned filmmaking, where story and character come to the fore. Like a Stephen King story, we invest ourselves in ""a build"" which pays off in some genuinely creepy moments and deep poignance. The lead, Sasha Andreev (who is a ringer for a young Gregory Harrison), is a talented actor whose low-key charisma grounds the whole affair even as we suspend disbelief.

4485332,5,B004W5MHIC,"Excellent independent film.  Much more than anticipated ""horror/paranormal"" movie.  More a study of human nature, people relationships, but still scary in a ""let the imagination scare me"" format.  Highly recommend.",1381017600,2,214,6.066666666666666
4485333,1,B004W5MHIC,Not a terrible idea for a movie but the acting was horrendous.  Decent acting would have made this low-budget film soooo much better.  Don't waste your time with this one.,1377043200,,171,4.666666666666667

4485337,3,B004W5MHIC,"I enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I watched it, but it could have been SO much better with a few additions and with a different ending - which I'll address under my spoiler alert.  If not for the ending - or lack thereof - I would have given ""Ghost from the Machine"" 4 stars.

First of all, I'm not sure who other reviewers were referring to about the bad acting, but I thought the guys who played Cody and his brother James did a great job. They were totally believable as two young men who had recently and tragically lost their parents in a car accident - both were woodenly ""going through the motions.""  I thought the other actors were okay too.  Everyone had their own grief to deal with, or they were finding it difficult/awkward to be around the two boys. Having said that, my husband said the guy who played Tom, the electrical engineer with the dead wife, was a bad actor.  But having said THAT, I thought he did a great job.

Except for the good-looking actor who played Cody, the choice of average-looking actors added to the believability and authenticity to what could have been a far-fetched Hollywood production full of beautiful people.

I thoroughly enjoyed the discreet creepiness and suspense in Ghost from the Machine. You kept waiting for those Sixth-Sense-esque moments - of which there were several.  As I said, however, this movie could have been so much better.  I agree with other reviewers who noted holes in the plot which gave the movie a disjointed feel - and not in a good way. For one thing, it needed more build-up as to WHY Cody was making the machine in addition to all the technical stuff. It was almost as if half the film ended up on the cutting-room floor.

***WARNING!!!  POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT BELOW!!!***

What was up with the ending?! We couldn't believe it! Did the writer/director/producers suddenly decide they were tired of writing/directing/producing this movie? ""Let's just end it here and go home, folks."" Either that, or it was a deliberate set-up for a sequel. (Tom trying to rebuild the machine hinted at a sequel?) Whatever the case, the resolution (a.k.a., denouement) was incomplete, unsatisfying, and terribly disappointing.  In addition to resolving the issue with James being removed from the home, I would have ended the movie with a twist - similar to the ending of The Sixth Sense.  Any thoughts from other viewers?",1365292800,,2377,4.723970944309928

8444499,3,B004W5MHIC,"The director and/or actors were really bad. I hate to blame the actors if it was just a poor director and it may have been that since I know nothing about how movies are made. Either way it made the actors look high school level to say the least. The thing is the idea and plot... the general story line is really thought provoking.
 Now as far as if the ideas were plausible on a technical level? I have no idea just as I suspect most people wouldn't. The technical aspect of it though wasn't the point in my opinion. The point is to make us question the ethical issues and the ""what if"" aspect to the question of potential problems that could arise when man plays with powerful technology that was previously left to (what many feel like) is, and always has been God's realm and has been like that for good reason. As is most all cases once man gets his hands into something then you can pretty much guarantee that you're going to have problems (tits or tires). It's been that way since Adam and Eve and it's pretty safe to assume that it'll continue on that way (at least in this physical dimension) until the end of man himself.
 Bottom line is that I suggest spending the time to watch this but only if you're the type of person who is capable of accepting before hand that it's going to be bad directing and/or bad actors but are intrigued by views on the paranormal and ""what if we could bring them back"" and more so  ""if so how exactly would that play out and what would their awareness level be if so""?
 Now I didn't say spoiler alert for a reason as I stayed extremely vague on purpose... so don't sweat it.
 This is not a great movie nor a good one even but it's different and thought provoking... at least for people like me who always seems to have a knack to look deeper into things than the ""average bear"" and for a late night ""b"" movie it was worth the effort... again... at least in my opinion.
 One last thing. I don't remember what genre they listed this movie as but it's most definitely NOT horror, nor is it a thriller really. I'd say a drama that could've possibly been a thriller or really light horror if directed and maybe written better. It reminds me of how bad most Steven King books transfer to movies. They end up looking ridiculous and amateur.",1475193600,,2276,4.30607476635514
8444500,4,B004W5MHIC,"This is a surprisingly good film, given its minimal budget of $25,000. Hollywood should take a lesson from this writer/ director, but I doubt they will. I read there will be a bigger budget remake. They should push this film instead. The acting is quite good from a bunch of unknowns. If you need big name stars in the movies you watch, this isn't for you. If you like a film with good dialog, interesting subplots, no Hollywood happy ending that will make you think and feel with a pretty plausible supernatural premise, look no further. This was a great ghost story well told. There are consequences to the actions of the people obsessed to the point where they neglect their lives in other areas.
