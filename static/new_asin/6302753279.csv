He's ""suprized"" to find they've already arived.  The kids struggle to help him get out of the janitor's worksuit and pull him off balance and into the audience.  He's that kind of playful throughout.
He's fun, but very respectful of the kids (no talking down).  Plenty of diversity in the show.  He takes them on an Indian Canoe ride (doing some AMAZING bird calls along the way), has several hand-play activities, has the kids repeating everything he says (under mock protest) . . . and closes on a gentle note with ""Hush Little Baby.""
He's got the attention of our seven-month-old every time we play this, and we've shown it to adults who've enjoyed it just as much (at least they act like they do).
Snap this one up!",1027728000,3,860,4.516129032258065
