I wish there was a little more instruction like in his other video. However, its good to see him in the gym. The video has its funny moments, especially when you see all of the food he eats to develop hid amazing shape. I also enjoyed the personal part where he's showing off his home and trophies from previous shows.",1479686400,,450,4.183908045977011

8139469,5,B000HEZEZA,"For me this DVD brings back a lot of memories.  In 2002 I moved to the east coast and just happened to take a computer job that was a few doors down from the World Gym where this is filmed.  And I just could not believe the luck - Levrone has been my favorite bodybuilder overall (after Arnold) ever since I started following different pros in magazines like Muscle & Fitness, and I never dreamed I would not only join the gym he owns, but actually get to know him somewhat (he's a really cool, humble guy).  And World Gym is still one of my all-time favorite training environments, too, very raw and basic with a lot of focus on iron and not as much on the fitness dilettantes that fill the marble palaces we train in today (e.g. Lifetime).  Too bad that all good things come to an end, as Kevin moved to Hollywood to pursue acting, and his World Gym is now some kind of facility for boxers or MMA or something.

What really blows me away still is not only his amazing physique with the most perfect proportions I've ever seen (at least by my eye for aesthetics), but he's FREAKING STRONG.  I used to think it was incredible to watch him do 405 on incline bench for 6 reps... but I'd never seen him do 405 for *shoulder press behind the head* (on the Smith machine, but come on, that's unbelievable).  His delts and traps look like a gigantic manta ray or something.

You also see and hear a lot from his co-owners who also prepare his meals for him - plates and plates of meat and veggies that make me hungry every time I watch.  It was very interesting to hear them discuss the expense of the food it takes to be Kevin's size and condition - even when buying in bulk it's quite astonishing.

You may need to set your TV to display this in the old aspect ratio of 4:3 to avoid everything looking too stretched wide.  Other than that, sit back and enjoy - you'll see all the exercises for different areas of the body but the video does move along so it's only one disc of less than 2 hours.  Kevin's band also is featured with many tracks included in the background as he trains.",1447804800,,2080,4.251269035532995
