1350934,5,B00004TJFJ,"Remembered this from my youth. The theme of the movie reminded me a lot of ""The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao"". Good message and good clean fun. They certainly don't make movies like this anymore.",1519689600,,189,4.428571428571429

1350938,5,B00004TJFJ,"My husband wanted this movie - said it was the scariest he saw as a child. I don't remember it at all, but even as an adult, for a 30 year old kid's movie, it was pretty creepy. Well worth the watch!",1515715200,,199,3.761904761904762
1350939,5,B00004TJFJ,A long time favorite for my family. There is nothing not to like except that it is hard to find so I was really happy to find it on Amazon.,1515456000,,139,3.6666666666666665

1350941,5,B00004TJFJ,"Re-watching this, I was reminded of the weird sense of (premature) existential loss I felt seeing it for the first time as a kid. The wells of nostalgia aren't too deep when you're 12, so I'm not sure where that came from.

Anyone else get this?",1513641600,,245,4.326086956521739

1350944,5,B00004TJFJ,Great copy and GREAT MOVIE--reminds me of my youth and takes me back to an era of innocence that I believe many movies lack these days.  I heard they are doing a remake; doubtful it could ever compare to this version even if it sees the light of day some time in the future.,1512950400,,274,4.074074074074074
1350945,5,B00004TJFJ,I watched this years ago. Classic tale of good vs evil with the Ray Bradbury touch. Good to watch on a cold autumn night...,1512518400,,123,4.166666666666667
1350946,5,B00004TJFJ,Watched this a  long time ago when my children were small.  Great movie and Mr. Dark is terrific.,1511654400,,97,4.333333333333333

1350949,5,B00004TJFJ,"This is one of those movies that you will remember for a long time.  It isn't scary, or gory.  Just good old fashioned suspense.  Dont overlook Johnathan Pryce either.  He makes evil cool.",1510012800,,188,4.606060606060606

1350954,5,B00004TJFJ,"This is an old favorite of mine that I only just got around to adding to my dvd collection.  Something Wicked This Way Comes is a surprisingly thought provoking movie considering that it's very much geared to kids/young adults.  It offers some good old-fashioned symbolism about good and evil presented eloquently.

What prompted me to buy it, however, was that I love the cinamatography in this film, greatly evokes nostalgia and mystery.  In my opinion, the special effects were done in such a way that they didn't come across as hokey or dated which can sometimes be an issue with older sci-fi/fantasy.",1508025600,,605,4.901960784313726
1350955,5,B00004TJFJ,Fast delivery great movie.,1508025600,,26,5.75
1350956,5,B00004TJFJ,Did not remember how creepy this movie was from my childhood. Enjoyed watching it again and was amazed that Disney had such a freak-tastic offering way back when.,1503187200,,162,4.821428571428571

1350959,1,B00004TJFJ,"If you love the Ray Bradbury book by the same name, don't bother with this piece of trash. It is horrible compared to the book. The producers of this film change characters, they introduce characters that are not in the book, they have one of the kids as narrator - I could only watch about 20 minutes. Stick with the book and don't bother with this piece of Hollywood junk.",1502496000,,374,4.357142857142857
1350960,1,B00004TJFJ,"Wow, this movie really sucks.  I'm a fan of Bradbury, but this disaster is not his fault.  There is so much wrong with it that it would make excellent fodder for Mystery Science Theater: bad acting, horrible effects, idiotic decisions, plot holes, dull dialogue, etc.",1502496000,,267,4.911111111111111
1350961,5,B00004TJFJ,"Really neat movie from quite a while ago. Beautifully shot with good acting and great narration. It's too bad there are not more films that emulate a kids imagination in a way relatable to even adults. The stuff of dreams and nightmares, but a wholly enjoyable and interesting ride.",1501977600,,282,4.775510204081633

1350970,3,B00004TJFJ,"This should have been a masterpiece!  I love the novel. I love the magical depiction of near-forgotten childhood ... and the Magic and disillusionment of growing up. This film had so much going for it: great screenplay done by the author of this truly great work; an amazing soundtrack by James Horner; a cast that were perfect and gave it their all ... BUT....THE DIRECTOR IS TERRIBLE.  Almost every scene I would have done differently. Drained of magic, this is a flawed attempt to depict this classic work.  I'm glad it was attempted BUT, PLEASE ...won't someone film the definitive version!",1496102400,,594,4.861386138613861

1350981,5,B00004TJFJ,"""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" is a cautionary tale from Ray Blackbury closely tied to his childhood. Small-town Illinois sets the scene for what seems to be a mundane, ordinary place. And it is, until the carnival shows up. The movie captures the excitement of a kid at the prospect of something exciting, fun, yet threatening and murky below the surface. Small towns are stereotypical of places where dreams go to die and so, this is a theme. The secret yearnings of the townspeople are exposed and exploited. The night confuses where amusement and entertainment end and something unsavory begins. If you think a horror film can't be charming you ought to see this one.",1488499200,,674,4.869565217391305
1350982,4,B00004TJFJ,"I don't remember watching this as a child but yet some parts were familiar so I must have somewhere along the way. Having said that, this was so much fun and definitely brought back that old time Disney nostalgia. Great for Halloween or really just anytime. Even though this is dated, it was still a great family film and we all enjoyed it.",1488499200,,340,4.412698412698413

BOTH DVDs are flawed - it skips all over the movie - or gets stuck in one place.  I don't believe its the player - I have played this on my dvd player - Toshiba, my computer, the xbox and the playstation - and it skips and drags - it reads on one laptop as a black dvd - . So disappointing.  I wish Amazon would make available on instant.",1477872000,,475,3.865979381443299
1351010,4,B00004TJFJ,"This 1983 film is based on Ray Bradbury's extremely popular 1962 story of the same name. This tale of good and evil features  Jonathan Pryce playing Mr. Dark, the owner  of Mr. Dark's Pandemonium Carnival who comes into Greentown, Illinois to make an offer to the citizens of the small town on October 24th. Mr. Dark seems to fool all except two boys, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade They spy on the traveling carnival to see what it has to offer. Before long, the boys begin to note that several townspeople are either missing or acting differently. They also notice a henchman, Mr. Croger changing into a young boy after riding the carousel backwards. In time, Mr. Dark sends  the forces of darkness begin to punish them and bring them to him.  The boys soon discover that Mr. Dark and his cronies have a plan to take control of the town and claim more innocent souls. The boys turn to Will's father (Jason Robards), the town librarian, who deciphers that ""something wicked this way comes."" The three did[atch Mr. Dark in an overblown climactic ending on the carousel. The problem I had with this is that Mr. Dark can be the devil or just the leader of the Autumn People who come around to steal souls. His and his cronies end is anti-climactic and so easy considering he was so powerful during the movie. Finally, James Horner's score is very effective.",1476921600,,1357,4.618257261410788

1351027,5,B00004TJFJ,"Great family horror film (yeah, I said it).  Really, this is a great intro for kids and the nostalgic mood should be highly entertaining for adults. While not exactly faithful to the Ray Bradbury classic novel it certainly captures the essence of it.  What you get is a look at true evil thru the eyes of two young boys, young enough to be impressionable but old enough to understand the peril they may be in. While the threats to the towns people are serious enough it never gets to violent or scary for kids to be upset by it.  Also, having kids as the heroic figures gives you the sense that it's not gonna turn into a blood bath.  I find it to be a chilling and frightening stroll down memory lane, to a simple time that still seems vulnerable as young boys look towards their impending adolescence.  Great film for adults and older children mature enough realize it's fantasy.",1473552000,,881,4.48125

I also liked how it takes place in the fall. so it's cool to watch in the summer/fall with all the carnivals and fairs happening during these months.

It is an excellent story about two young boys discovering the fascination and the evil of a Carnie travelling through their town, The language is poetic and electrifying and the characters are all well defined and the tension is palpable throughout. It is certainly more than worthy of borrowing the title from MacBeth, because this is truly an amazing portrayal of wicked evil. One of the great inspiring books!

1351067,4,B00004TJFJ,"This film is a masterpiece of cinematic poetry. Yes, it has a plot too, but the plot is marginal to the production and not especially important. What is important are the images and the conversations between the characters. Savor these images, and allow yourself to be immersed in them. No one can evoke small town America as effective as Ray Bradbury, although as a science fiction writer Bradbury is often dismissed as a captive of the genre rather than as an independent voice that can stand on his own in the literary canon.

Reviewers rarely speak of American films or American stories turned into films as being ""cinematic poetry,"" to the point that to invoke the phase makes one think of European art house flicks. But this is no European art house flick, and it pursues its poetry, and presents its images, in a very different way, and, importantly, in a way that is entirely consonant with Ray Bradbury's style of writing. This is not surprising, as Bradbury not only wrote the story, but also wrote the screenplay, so it is true to his vision. This is what American cinematic poetry looks like.

I'm not giving this film five stars as it is not a perfect film, but it is a very good film, and frequently unappreciated for that it is.",1448668800,,1243,4.619909502262443

I love the heart and soul of this story - the tale of a boy and his father, and a dark carnival that comes to town one late October evening.  When I was growing up in the late 60s, Bradbury became my favorite writer, though I didn't read Something Wicked until I was in my late 30s.  Don't miss this one - especially if you're already a Bradbury fan.  Also, I have to mention the superb performance by Jonathan Price as Mr. Dark.  He captured the character perfectly, as did all the actors in this darkly sweet story of coming of age and coming to awareness.",1448236800,,696,4.315384615384615

1351074,5,B00004TJFJ,"When a mysterious Autumn carnival comes to a small, Illinois town in the early 20th century, two small boys find themselves caught up in a dark and terrifying adventure, being hunted by a tattooed, sinister entity who gives people their greatest wishes at the cost of their very souls. Also involved is the town librarian, aged father of one of the boys, whose lamenting of lost youth and time makes him particularly vulnerable to the evil carnival master's temptations.

Back in the early 80's, Disney was trying to give itself a new reputation. Their usual brand of entertainment wasn't as desirable as it once was, and yet their reputation seemed to limit them from exploring other types of film-making beyond lighthearted, family fare. Disney had created more serious and even violent/dark ""family"" hits during Walt's time, but even the more famous ones (Treasure Island, for example) were eventually overshadowed by the likes of Winnie the Pooh and the Shaggy D.A., and all but forgotten except by the truest Disney fanatics. So, in that early 80's era, Disney attempted to re-establish themselves as a regular film studio rather than an exclusively happy and cartoony one. Though, even in these attempts, the desire to not lose that ""family"" audience they'd had since the beginning remains clear (till they finally just said, let's create the Touchstone label).

""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" was their strongest attempt at making an out and out horror film, though one still viewable by a family audience. As I said, they weren't willing to let go of that under the Disney name, and that's as it should be. Now, keep in mind, that is to mean an 80's family audience, early 80's, to be specific, which is quite different than today's. Today, frankly, people are wimps when it comes to what they will let their kids see in a movie. Ironically, they end up seeing far worse than we ever imagined back in the day thanks to the internet, so it's sad that today's parents are needlessly forcing the dumbing down of family films and other media so their kids won't be scared by skeletons and stuff in a family film. Bring on the labrador puppies and clumsy, clueless, bungling villains, and nothing more under a family label, please. *sigh* Not that I'm suggesting every family film should be as scary as Something Wicked. Not at all. But there's no reason that there shouldn't be family horror films like this; family horror films not afraid to show really scary imagery and characters, with serious tones and themes, and rich dialogue. Not trying to smooch Ray Bradbury's buttocks here either. I often have to warm up to his works, and this one had to grow on me too. Sometimes, his descriptive narrations seem a bit pretentious, to be honest. But then, novel-style narration often sounds that may to me when actually read aloud.

At any rate, the final product with ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" is a family watchable Disney horror/fantasy that, granted, comes pretty close to the line, at least with that Disney label on it, but still should be fine for most ages except the youngest and most sensitive. The two main characters are little kids, after all. But, in honesty, I think this film would be best appreciated by adults, partly because of the turn of the century setting, and partly because the main themes of this film are regret over lost youth. As the film puts it, regret not over ""the things you did, but the things you didn't do."" That's what this film is all about. Regret, and feeling past your prime to do anything about it. Yes, I would THINK this film would be best appreciated by an older crowd, but not exclusively. If you are younger but more thoughtful about things, life, etc..., you should experience it too. Despite all the rehashing it went through during the filmmaking process, the final product is very good. It's visually beautiful. The acting is fantastic (featuring the likes of Jason Robards and Jonathan Price), and the effects and horror quite effective and horrific. It's got a strong atmosphere, inventing a magical, oddly Rockwellian breed of Horror. The feeling of impending danger, the tension and even sadness are beautifully conveyed. It's a powerful little family film, and excellent for the Halloween and even post-Halloween, pre-Thanksgiving period for lingering horror film desires that don't require slasher films to quench. Highly recommended. Also recommended: The Watcher in the Woods and Return to Oz.

Oh, nearly forgot, the DVD only holds one bonus feature, the theatrical trailer. Definitely a good bonus feature to have, but considering all the reworking this film went through, it's a crime there isn't much, much more. Hopefully, we will see more on the bluray, though the odds are against it. In fact, while this film would surely get a blu-ray release if another studio made it, with Disney there's no way to tell. Probably will come out through the Disney Movie Club first, and probably with no more features than it has now. Ya can never tell though.",1447545600,,5023,4.878220140515222

1351090,4,B00004TJFJ,"This was one of the few movies that I saw as a child that absolutely scared the hell out of me which I refused to see again until just recently when its memory was sparked within me.  It's now over thirty years old (the cinematography makes it dated), and looking at several Disney movies over the years (be the live action or animated), this was a rather odd addition.  As it is in the original Ray Bradbury story as well as this movie adaptation, the main characters are children, and there is a sci fi / fantasy element to it, the atmosphere and mood is very dark and somber.  You will not find a happy moment or musical number with bright chatter and fun moments.  Or maybe it was just Jason Robards's presence.  Because he had the biggest adult presence in this movie.  This was during a period in the early 1980s when Disney was attempting to break away from their traditional elements and bring a more mature, darker presence yet keep it somewhat kid oriented.  Was it successful?  While other productions like The Dark Crystal were successful in that they turned a healthy profit in their day and remain cult classics, this obvious presence of evil was a bit too heavy for kid audiences, and has since fallen by the wayside.

One day in the past, a small town in Illinois with its charming small town characters has a visitor come to town upon the arrival of October.  A traveling carnival has come to town, seemingly so innocent and fun.  It arrived in the middle of the night and seemed to pop up like magic, two friends, Jim and Will, are rather curious about it.  What seems like a rather harmless bit of entertainment is not all what it seems.  Soon all of the townsfolk come for an innocent visit, and all their deepest wishes come true in the house of mirrors.  The bartender is missing an arm and a leg, the barber wishes for gorgeous women, the old maid schoolteacher wants to be young and beautiful again.  And they get their wishes, and if only they knew what they wished for.  And Mr. Dark... Dear, sweet, delightful Mr. Dark (also known as The Illustrated Man) with his silver tongue and his illustrious presence, the devil himself.  Jim and Will realize the horror and try to warn everyone in their small town, but their pleas fall on deaf ears.  Even when they make Will's father, played by Jason Robards who seemed to have looked like an elderly man long before he actually was an elderly man, believe them, it's so too late for so many of them.  Watch all those innocent souls damned when you deepest wish comes true.  Because everything has a price.

This was very heavy, for either a kid or an adult audience.  As a kid what scared me so much was the now cheesy looking special effects, although I got a few things about it here and there.  I think what hit me harder than expected was the moment when Mr. Dark in the classic temptation moment you knew was coming  in good vs. evil when the Devil is tempting us said that he would make him young again.  He took pages of a book and ripped them out, each year by year ... Wow.  I'm 40 now, and that hurt to hear that.  What would I give to be young again?  What would I have done differently?  Well, I wish I had done a lot of things differently, like we all have.  And yet, I have no regrets.  I took risks, I have had exciting adventures in my life, I have learned, I have achieved many things.  I don't want to be 20 again, I want to be the age I am.  But it's also important to have a certain amount of regret so that we learn, and be ok with the fact that we learned and not be bitter about things either.  Easier said than done, of course, but we'd be perfect then and there would be no need to learn.

I'd say this is better for youth literature rather than a kid's movie today.  Because of the Disney label we might think this is more of a little kid movie, but it's more of a junior high school / teenager movie.  And Pam Grier is in this, and she's pretty hot as the witch.",1443744000,,3959,4.287061994609164

DARK can make you want to wish you were back in your youthful days when you looked pretty or good and felt good. You see, he thrives on human regrets and despair as he says they call them in the night like lonely dogs. His assistant, a ""Dust Witch"" played by Pam Grier can make your heartbeat go slower and slower until you feel the ""taste of death"". Their true weaknesses are love and lightning.
Ray Bradbury's movie version of his book really captures the spirit and essence. It is well done and highly recommended.

1351166,3,B00004TJFJ,"Fans of the book may find themselves a little disappointed with the film. Although the tone and production values are excellent, Bradbury made some substantial changes to the plot with his screenplay, introducing a lot of material, and dropping certain important events and characters. Some of this may represent the less advanced special effects of the day and associated costs, some may represent changes Bradbury wished to make to the story, and some may derive from pressures from the collaborators or the studio. What we have is a pretty good film in the Disney tradition, with good performances by Pryce and Robards, but something that is not quite a film of Bradbury's book.

I suggest reading the book first.",1414800000,,716,5.016806722689076

1351170,2,B00004TJFJ,"I'm not really sure what to think about 'Something Wicked This Way Comes'? Truth be told, I expected alot more, of everything. Alot more creepiness, terror, magic, atmosphere, suspense, etc., etc. I wanted to see this as a child but never got the chance, and since it hasn't been on television in the last twenty years or so that I've seen, the opportunity to see this never presented itself, so I did what I had to do and bought the DVD, without actually haven seen the film (which is something I RARELY ever do, and for good reason). Now I'm stuck with a $10 shingle, that shall remain unwatched forevermore in my DVD collection.  Now  what I will give it props for is the beautiful set design and the way the film was shot was fantastic. The cinematographer and set designer(s) deserves a ton of credit for making this much better than the sum of its parts (which is really why I give this two stars instead of one). It was a boorish script based off of a lackluster (in my opinion) Ray Bradbury story, and barely kept my interest. Even my kids were bored and falling asleep watching this snoozer. Definitely not worth the price of admission and could have been far better (and scarier) had the script been given a few washings.",1414368000,,1231,4.491071428571429

I first saw it at the theatre and was swept away by the dark mystical nature...but long before that I read the book (will just add here that Ray Bradbury has always been my favorite author). This is a fairly accurate adaptation and the actors do a great job. It's hard for me to believe it's a Disney film, but somehow they managed to keep from slipping into either dumbed down, or goofy--which Disney often does, IMO. But yes, every October, I pull this out with the other movies I watch at this time of year, and save it as the last and best of the group.

1351187,5,B00004TJFJ,"I've seen the movie a few times and still marvel at Jonathan Pryce as Mr. Dark.  His performance is superb as well as Jason Robards who brings intelligence and calm to a otherwise terrifying circus that has come to town.  Everybody is great and the atmosphere is one of calm dread if that is possible.  Especially the scene when the parade comes through town and Charles Hollaway(Robard's ) meets the menacing Mr. Dark.  The Library sequence is amoung my favorite as well as the ending sequence. Overall it is one of my favorite horror movies, with no ""gore"" needed to convey the horror of Bradbury's masterpiece.",1412121600,,613,4.754716981132075

Two boys are excited to go to the carnival and soon find out the carnival's deadly secret. They seek the help of the town's librarian, Halloway, who must now fight the carnival.

One of Jason Robard's sweetest roles of an older father to a young boy, who has too many regrets. The film is also beautiful in some parts especially at the end showing the fall colors. This movie is great to have around the house for the grandkids to watch at night, and especially in the fall, when this story is based.

1351221,5,B00004TJFJ,"I love this movie because it is so true to Ray Bradbury's special world.  I don't know why there aren't more Bradbury stories turned into movies. This director did well by Bradbury.  The color and rhythm of this film keeps your interest and the little boys are darling and true to life. Jason Robards adds such pathos and depth to the character of an older father who feels as if he failed his young son.  It was made well before CGI became the padding used to buck up inferior films.  This one has a few non-CGI special effects, but they are subtle and infrequent. This movie has its scary and eerie ingredients and may frighten young, young kids, but the elementary ones and older will empathize with Will and Jim as they feel their way through a creepy time in their lives.",1403654400,,776,4.443661971830986

1351233,4,B00004TJFJ,"Despite sporadic speed-bumps, the Disney production of 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' is a frequently chilling though frustratingly flawed cinematic journey, with stellar performances from Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce strongly at its center.

Fantasy is a tricky genre to begin with, and Ray Bradbury's vivid literary imagination has oft proven elusive and notoriously difficult to capture on film, though some directors -- notably Francois Truffaut ('Fahrenheit 451') -- have come close.

But while Jack Clayton's uneven film of Bradbury's own adaptation of his classic novel of good and evil is a rather mixed bag, there is, on balance, a lot to like and even savor here. And with the welcome presence of Royal Dano, Pam Grier and Diane Ladd added to the mix, the end result captures more of the wistfully nostalgic and hauntingly nightmarish flavor of Bradbury's dark parable of lost dreams, temptation, and the healing power of love than one might have expected.

One of the film's drawbacks, however -- and in a story of this nature it's a pervasive one -- is that the special effects techniques available at the time necessarily limited what could believably be shown, and the film is therefore at its visual best in capturing Pandemonium Carnival's black magic when the effects are at their most subtle. But the best and most memorable moments are when the effects take a back seat to the dramatic sorcery of Robards and Pryce, rising to an unforgettable peak in the film's most powerfully sustained sequence -- the marvelous late night library showdown between Charles Halloway and Mr. Dark.

And now that the book is set to be filmed again -- perhaps more successfully this time -- you could certainly do worse than seeing this frequently splendid and hauntingly atmospheric adaptation in the meantime.

But, as an important postscript, I should note that I was fortunate to see an earlier pre-release version of this film with numerous vivid differences from the final release print. And with far less reliance on effects and with a different (and magnificent) score by Georges Delerue, it was a longer, subtler, richer, and somehow more adult experience than the ""Disneyized"" re-vamp that was ultimately shown in theaters. And I must admit that it's all but impossible for me to think of this film without recalling the stronger impact of Clayton's original cut of Bradbury's darkly allegorical masterpiece. (Restored 'Director's Cut' BluRay release please?)",1397088000,,2476,5.149253731343284
1351234,5,B00004TJFJ,"I gave it five stars because it was actually a little disturbing about how the story plays out. Very well executed and overall likeable characters, very mysterious and creepy Villain Mr. Dark. I know it was based on a Ray Bradbury book, but dang....not too many of these book related movies ever turn out well. This is the exception! I love all the plot twists and various surprises in the movie not going to spoil it for anyone who has not seen this movie. But, it comes as highly recommended for general viewing! I'm not entirely sure if this is appropriate for children as the type of mood or atmosphere it sets might be frightening to young ones that are under the age of 10.

Keep in mind that little kids should probably not watch it, might be best for teenagers and above.  I hear my kids telling me of movies that impacted them when watched as young kids that now they can't watch as adults.  This may be one of those movies.

It is simplistic and rather tame by today's standards, but did create a good and tense mood.  It is not one of Disney's best, nor is it the worst---not by far.  A few disturbing images, but safe for young teens and older grade school-aged children (as long as they are not already jaded or desensitized by modern gore/horror shock treatment films).",1384560000,,581,4.383177570093458

Will's older father, Jason Robarts, regrets not being able to be the one to save his son when he fell into a torrent stream, and this prays on his mind. Will's best friend, Jim Nightshade, has no father and his subconcious mind want's Dark to be his father. The boy's find out about Dark's purpose to enjoy the sorrow and suffering of the people who come under his influence. Dark discovers they know and begins to track them down. Will's librarian father discovers Dark's troop is ""The Autumn People"" from the town's historical documents. Dark catches the boys in the father's library, and I will not spoll the ending for you.

1351280,5,B00004TJFJ,"I fell in love with this movie the very first time I saw it, years ago, and it has become a traditional viewing during Halloween week, just like ""A Christmas Story"" is for its own holiday. The film follows two young friends in a small Illinois town during the crisp, windy-cool days of fall in October. Each of the boys, and each of the town's characters, has a fear, hope or dream that has an influence on this morality tale, searched out and twisted by the nefarious Mr. Dark when his carnival comes to town. The story is based on a work by Ray Bradbury, and also examines the relationship between fathers and sons, and especially between the main character, Will, and his father, played by Jason Robards. Even though the movie may feel slightly dated, especially with the special effects, you can almost smell the falling leaves and feel yourself kicking through them. In many ways it's easy to relate to this movie, even given the supernatural aspect of it. The small town, the ghostly winds of fall bringing in a mysterious carnival...even the aging father concerned that he isn't doing enough with, or for, his son...the movie pulls you in and you end up wondering which of your own desires could also be your downfall in Mr. Dark's evil emporium. The film is almost an homage to small towns, where you know everyone yet everyone has a secret. And although there are parts that are frightening (more in a spooky way, rather than the grisly horror of many current movies), you can watch this as a family and it could even lead to some interesting discussions afterward. I highly recommend this film.",1383004800,,1604,4.651408450704225

1351327,5,B00004TJFJ,"Dark's Pandemonium Carnival steams into town on a cold autumn's eve, bringing with it strange and fantastic attractions that tempt the weak at heart with prospects of newed youth, beauty, fame, lust, and other fine riches. Two young boys discover the sinister secret that has brought the autumn people back to their small town, as they make a stand against its evil proprietor. Ray Bradbury's frightful fantasy horror novel is brought to life in SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES, directed by THE INNOCENT's Jack Clayton. Clayton directs with a youthful exuberance that allows us to turn back the clock and become children once again, if only for a moment. With the aid of James Horner's orchestral score, the mood dances between light and dark, but always leaves us with the feeling of childlike wonder. As handsome as he is unsettling, Jonathan Pryce lives up to his character's name as the devilish Mr. Dark. He need only speak a line of Bradbury's prose to elicit chills. Jason Robards stands against him as the fading father figure who must conquer the regrets of old age to save his young son. The boys, played by Vidal Peterson and Shawn Carson, also capture the excitement and fears of childhood perfectly amidst the coming darkness. When placed within the confines of the ominous carnival setting, SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES becomes a living nightmare, and serves as a memorable fantasy horror film that is fun for the whole family!

Everything about this movie just screams autumn. Watching it is like realizing the promise of autumn and cooler weather, along with holidays, and Halloween, bringing fond childhood memories.

1351348,4,B00004TJFJ,"1983 Disney produced filming of Ray Bradbury's novel, script by Bradbury. Wonder and horror filled story of childhood fears, family obligations, past longings and future dreams. Suprisingly dark for a Disney film and perhaps could have been more so but delivers on strong characters, eerie effects and great story. Jonathon Price is a standout, absolutley perfect in the role of Mr Dark. Also has one of the creepiest child performances in the red headed changling.

It will probably NOT be exciting enough for those that are already spoiled by the likes of Michael Myers, Freddie Krueger, or Jason Vorheese(sp).

1351356,1,B00004TJFJ,"Was this made for TV? Having recently read the novel, I was eager to see the 1983 movie adaptation made by Disney. Although Ray Bradbury is credited with having written the screenplay, I imagine the finished product was anything he was happy with. The movie differs from the novel in much regard, with key plot points changed to render the movie a hideous mess of a thing. I was seething as I watched the movie, seeing these plot changes which were vital to the make-up, essence and design of the original story. As I continued to watch this ridiculously truncated, sanitized, and  implausible film, I could not help but feel Jack Clayton (an accomplished British Director), must have been nervously running his fingers through his hair in the editing room as he said to himself ""What have I done?"" Disney has managed to turn a classic tale of the battle between good vs. evil into a student film with wooden acting (save for Jonathan Pryce as Mr. Dark), slim to little production value, and a cookie-cutter story that is not only predictable but very unsatisfying. Do yourself a favor, read the book and stay away from this forgettable and regrettable waste of time, and pray that the ""powers that be"" decide to make a true adaptation of Bradbury's masterpiece.",1322784000,,1262,4.762557077625571

I have seen it twice now and I hate to say that I find it boring, although I watched it the first time thinking it would be great.  I liked the premise of it (two young boys, small town life, a mysterious and sinister carnival, etc) and I liked the look of it (the sets, the costumes, the atmosphere), but the film wasn't really scary (perhaps it is scary for children), the pacing was slow, slow, slow, and the presence of Jason Robards made me want to yawn. I know Robards was considered a big deal when he was alive and he has won awards, but he just bores me to tears in everything I've seen him in (three films, including this one), plus he looked old enough in this film to be Holloway's grandfather, not his father.  He never seems genuinely frightened in any of the scenes either.  For me, the best part of this film was Pam Grier as the Dust Witch.  I think I want to be her for Halloween.  I agree with the previous reviewer that she needed a bigger part.",1318204800,,1030,4.1767676767676765

SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES is evidence that PG films can be (at least, could be) well-made, and NOT just kiddie fare! What I like most about this movie is its unsettling atmosphere of dread and creeping doom.

1351363,4,B00004TJFJ,"I love the book and I enjoyed the movie.  The confrontation in the library between Jonathan Pryce's Mr. Dark and Jason Robards' Mr. Holloway is particularly memorable. Pryce makes an ideal Mr. Dark--he contains his fury and hate beneath a brittle courtesy--in other words, he is perfectly Satanic, his smile belying his cold, penetrating stare.  The boys are good enough, and Jason Robards is always a pleasure.  Young viewers will benefit from this introduction to moral ideas: sin, temptation, guilt, forgiveness, and the power of redemptive love, all dressed with the dark fantasy of Bradbury's wild imagination.  The more sophisticated viewer, however, still waits for the definitive version of Bradbury's beautiful and haunting book.",1299196800,,738,5.447368421052632

1351365,4,B00004TJFJ,"Here's how I stumbled upon this beaut. One night at home I started reading a Wikipedia article on Pam Grier and saw this under her filmography. Once I saw what it was about I had to watch it to. Immediately upon watching this film I started to draw parallels between it and the films ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lady-in-White/dp/B000A7LRA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lady in White</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stephen-King-s-It/dp/B00006FDCD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stephen King's It</a>&nbsp;and the book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thief-of-Always-A-Fable/dp/0060177241/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thief of Always: A Fable</a>"". It has that eerie feel to it, yet is mild enough for a 10 year old to watch it and not get totally ""creeped out"". It is narrated by an older man but pretty much shown in the eyes of a child.

This film follows two young boys Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway who are good friends and whose birthdays are basically a couple minutes apart. With Will being born a minute before Oct 31st, and Jim a minute after. It gleans on their life where Jim's Father an alcoholic has left him with his mother and Will's father is an older man who incidentally was the son of a preacher for the town. The tale unfolds when a carnival arrives in town and shows how the townspeople are affected and what the Carnival leader wants from them.

I do not want to give away any more of the film, but all in all, this is a very entertaining film. I give it 4 stars as apposed to a 5 star rating because I feel that it needed to be fleshed out more. Otherwise its quite entertaining.

Watch it and draw your own conclusions.",1291161600,,1784,5.527472527472527
1351366,5,B00004TJFJ,I saw this movie on TV when my children were little.  I loved it then and love it now.  The story is different and not too scary for little children.  It has become a Halloween tradition at my house.,1290816000,,199,4.051282051282051
1351367,5,B00004TJFJ,Excellent adaptation from the book--probably because the screenplay was written by Bradbury himself.  Excellent cast.  High marks for the visual effects and editing.,1289520000,,165,6.130434782608695
1351368,5,B00004TJFJ,"Time has been good to this adaptation of what might be Ray Bradbury's best novel, ""Something Wicked This Way Comes.""  When it first came out, it seemed somehow less than magical, particularly given the kinds of wonders that Spielberg and Lucas were doing at the time.  But viewed now, its grounding in reality only helps sell the fantasy elements.  Bradbury's story of a demonic carnival that comes to a small Illinois town in the autumn of young boy's memories has been more or less faithfully rendered, and differs from the book chiefly in the denouement, which in the film is a little more visceral and ""horrific."" But there are still many, many magical moments.  The library scene in which the evil Mr. Dark (a surprisingly cast, but effective Jonathan Pryce) squares off against the upright but morose Charles Halloway (a subtly steely Jason Robards) could not have been better filmed--it is the scene from the novel verbatim--and a few other scenes also equal Bradbury's vision, including the appearance of the evil carnival members parading through the small town, and the two young leads dealing with their stuffy teacher.  As the young protagonists, Vidal Peterson and Shawn Carson are adequate (the former more a bit more adequate than the latter), but a fair amount of important character information is lost in garbled and/or hasty line delivery, for which director Jack Clayton has to share some of the blame.  Pam Grier as the Dust Witch is a complete reimagining from the character in the book, but it works (though the novel's sequence of the Dust Witch searching for the boys at night in a hot air balloon, which has been replaced by a tarantula attack, is not a good trade off).  Despite the caveats, no theatrical film has come as close to capturing Bradbury's unique Americana-after-dark vision and voice as this one.  On top of it all is a wonderful score by James Horner and, for those who are interested, some of the earliest computer generated imagery on film.",1286668800,,1984,4.8664688427299705
1351369,3,B00004TJFJ,"This movie is a curiosity. It struggles to find a niche for itself, and
although it has some interesting imagery and effects, the overall
effect seems rushed and incomplete. In a nutshell, a town is menaced by
a mysterious carnival that arrives suddenly and it's up to two young
boys to uncover the truth. I found ""Something Wicked This Way Comes""
interesting, but I also found it quite unsatisfying. I came to the film
with no knowledge of the plot and at the end of the film I wasn't much
the wiser! As it stands, what we have is (slight spoilers just here):
the arrival of the carnival, the two young friends generally exploring
it and seeing too much, and the rest of the townsfolk somehow falling
under some strange spell and/or disappearing.

The two young leads are appealing but not capable of depicting enough
emotion to carry the movie, as their acting range is limited to little
more than blank staring and surprise. Little better is the Jason
Robards as the blond moppet's father, and all scenes between these two
are pretty wooden, even the crucial climactic rescue scene, which kind
of dilutes any tension. The script doesn't help at all, in fact nobody
ever seems to have anything important to say. Shame, because Jonathan
Pryce is excellent as the carnival head honcho.

The story would probably have benefited from being turned into a TV
miniseries rather than this feature film. Something more along the
lines of the original ""Salem's Lot"" series would have allowed the story
and characters to develop better, and we could have gradually got
involved in the little mini plots around each town-person who gets
wrapped up in the carnival's power, as well as explaining all the
bewildering elements like the fortune teller, the big ticket seller who
gets younger, the spiders, etc, etc. What the carnival is actually
doing and why (and how!) should have been the most intriguing part of
the film but it's so vaguely depicted that it meant I hardly got
involved in the mystery at all. I mean, I thought I got what was
happening when they showed the frumpy teacher who gained her beauty but
lost her sight, but what about the one armed football player who just
got younger with no ill-effects? And why did some of the victims turn
into exhibits? As I said, I thought there were some good ideas in here
but they needed more room to grow so that we could have got the hang of
it all properly.",1283126400,,2403,4.651764705882353
1351370,5,B00004TJFJ,"This movie is one I can watch over and over and never tire . I bought it for that purpose, and it was not a dissapointment. The visual beauty of fall, the fields of pumpkins, the tension of running through a darkened graveyard and Bradbury's screenplay make me shiver again and again. This is a classic to be enjoyed by anyone over the age of 10, especially those who love Halloween. Not the slasher gore but the anticipation of youth and the agonies of parenthood. Buy it, keep it, and watch it with your family.",1280966400,,513,4.410526315789474
1351371,4,B00004TJFJ,"A carnival comes to town bringing the promise of ""wishes fulfilled"".  But when you accept gifts from the Devil, it always comes with a price.

  This story revolves around two pre-pubescent boys, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade, best friends, that live in a small New England town, who are both enthralled with the allure of the carnival and its exotic mysteries.  Will is the son of an older man, the town's librarian, who years earlier nearly watched his young son die in the river because he couldn't swim. Instead, Jim's father, the town drunk, had jumped in and saved him. The relationship between Will and his father is strained by this thing they never talk about, and by the age chasm that separates them. Jim's drunken father abandoned him and his mother years before, and Jim's shame and hurt cause him to find the temptations offered by Mr. Dark, the carnival MC, difficult to resist.  But when they both realize what kind of creature Mr. Dark is, and that he is after them, they must turn to Will's aging father for help.  Will he fail his son again?

  This is a Disney film with a PG rating, probably due to one suggestive scene involving the town's barber, who dreams of exotic ladies, being surrounded and caressed by a tent full of beautiful, mysterious ladies. He appears naked,  though his bare chest is all that is exposed. The film is pretty tame by today's standards, and yet it does not seem outdated.  It is well done, an appealing and enduring story, with a clear 'good versus evil' message and characters. There are outstanding performances by Jonathan Pryce as Mr. Dark and Jason Robards as Charles Halloway, as well as the two boys, Vidal Peterson and Shawn Carson, as Will and Jim.  Though the story centers around the kids, adults can find it just as enjoyable, especially if they enjoy a film that mixes a bit of nostalgia with a bit of mystery and danger.",1278201600,,1888,4.633633633633633
1351372,5,B00004TJFJ,"Who would ever think that Walt Disney Productions would get in on the horror craze of the late '70s and early '80s?  That was the golden age of horror films.  Even Disney felt the pressure of the marketplace and made this 1983 horror film based on Ray Bradbury's novel of the same name.  A few years earlier, in 1979, Disney made a completely different (and better) version of their classic vinyl record Chilling Thrilling Sounds Of The Haunted House that originally came out in 1964.  This no doubt was an example of feeling the pressure of the marketplace after the huge success of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and other horror movies.  The 1979 record is far scarier than the 1964 record.  So, they decided to take things a step further with their own contribution to the Halloween/horror MOVIE marketplace, Something Wicked This Way Comes.

I'll sum this movie up like this:  A traveling carnival called Dark's Pandemonium Carnival visits Green Town, Illinois in October.  Prior to the carnival's arrival, a man tells two boys about looming danger that is on its way to their town.  These curious boys sneak around the carnival grounds after dark and come across the deadly secret of the carnival.  The mysterious and creepy Mr. Dark, the carnival's head, is in hot pursuit of the boys as the carnival's secret is out.

This movie stars Jason Robards, Jonathan Pryce, Diane Ladd, and Pam Grier.  The best performance is by the then-unknown Jonathan Pryce as Mr. Dark.  Overall, this movie's atmosphere is perfect.  The time of year the story takes place is in October in the Midwest, which adds to the creepiness.  The carnival is creepy at dusk and even creepier after dark.  You'll see an exotic sort of Egyptian dancer, a storm making its way toward the carnival, a hall of mirrors, a parade through town, etc.  This is a dark carnival with some supernatural elements thrown in.  The movie has that typical Disney charm to it, but I give Disney a big pat on the back for overstepping their boundary lines and including a little bit of gore, lots of tarantulas, a thunderstorm, and for making a movie that shows Disney's dark side and their response to the horror movie marketplace.

The score is by James Horner and is quite good.

I recommend this movie if you want something unique and a little different from Disney.",1277251200,,2331,4.763092269326683

A large and eclectic cast. Of course Jonathan Pryce is silky as satan. Pam Grier in an odd role as the Dust Witch (during a lean stretch for her), while Royal Dano sinks his teeth into one of his signature characters. James Stacey (Ed the Barman) had his real life ruined twice: first by a drunk driver, and second, very much through his own doing. I cannot understand how Shawn Carson (who played Jim Nightshade) did NOTHING in either film or television after this, as he seemed a great young talent.

This has to be one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen by disney, until years later, I didn't even know it was by them. I was eight or nine the first time I saw it, my mom saw the title and was turned off by it, so I couldn't own it.

Bottom line: yes, they most certainly do. Jonathan Price as Mr. Dark is as fine a villain as has ever been envisioned. The carousel scene at the end is still one of the most chill-inducing I've seen in a PG movie. Perhaps the most haunting vision is the old teacher's dream of being the beauty she once was; she pays a hefty price for it, and I won't ruin it any more here; if you've never seen this though, the results are chilling.  I cannot recall the actress' name. I just looked on IMDB, I believe it was Ellen Geer - and in the hands of anybody else, the scene would have felt phony; they found a real jewel, however, and she plays this scene brilliantly. The Dust Witch would also serve to scare me senseless as a younger man; she's still wickedly spooky 25 years later. Jason Robards seems a bit old to be the father, and he always did to me, but at the same time, he anchors this stellar cast and keeps the focus on the point of redemption that lies deep at the heart of the movie.

1351383,5,B00004TJFJ,"Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983) was an unconditional five star horror film from Disney studios. This DVD provided two versions of the movie at 1.66:1 and 1.33:1 and was a good value except for the picture quality which was just so, so.

This movie was really great and depicted an old time traveling carnival having the ability to grant your deepest wish, but then totally taking away your ability to enjoy it, and then some. This is referred to as a price, but it is far darker than a simple cost for your wish.

Spoilers:

1) The once town beauty is now very old and wishes for her beauty again. She suddenly finds herself young and beautiful, but then goes blind while staring in the mirror. She then is taken by the Carnival, as are all their victims.

2) Mr. Crasetti, the town barber, wants nothing more than to see some beautiful elegant woman visit his town. The fortune teller (""Dust Witch"") reads his mind and tells him that he would be ""oh so happy"" if he could see some elegant ladies and tells him they are waiting for him. Mr. Crasetti goes to the side show to see the harem girls dance, and winds up during his short lived session being converted into Madam Crasetti, the fat bearded lady (and from the sounds of his conversion, being castrated for good measure).

3) Ed, the town barman and amputee, wants only to be able to play football like he could when he was whole. He walks into the mirrored maze and is made a complete man only to be turned into a young boy.

4) Mr. Tetley wants nothing more than to win a game of chance which he does at one of the carnivals games. Then the Carnival gives him $1000 in winnings, free tickets for the Ferris wheel and a seat next to a very beautiful young woman who is the Dust Witch in disguise. He disappears into the bowels of the Carnival and all that is left of him is his cigar.

5) Tom Fury, the seller of lightning rods, who I believe to be a magical and powerful individual with some influence over lightning, doesn't seem to wish for anything but to supply people with his rods for their protection from a coming storm. Never missing a chance to punish a good deed, he is tortured by the carnival people with an electric chair in order to extract the time of arrival of an important storm. Only too human, his only short coming appears to be his being smitten by the beautiful Dust Witch, who he admires saying ""More beautiful than Pocahontas"".

I never read the book to know what the novel was about, but it is clear that the basic story is from the mind of the great Ray Bradbury.

They look almost exaggerated. But that (and the fact that the music theme sounds like the Imperial Theme in the Star Wars Trilogy) is the only complaint I have about the entire film.

1351392,3,B00004TJFJ,"""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" starts brilliantly with the arrival of ""Mr. Dark's carnival"" in a small, quiet town. They are no ordinary carnival, however, because mysterious Mr. Dark (Jonathan Pryce) seems to know the desires hidden in the hearts of townspeople. In fact, he knows how to make them come true. You get what you want, but it comes with a price to pay.

The film captures the darkly poetic touch of Ray Bradbury's 1962 novel with believable descriptions of the lives of main characters - two boys Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade, Will's father Charles Halloway (Jason Robarts) - living in this peaceful town. Will and Jim are the first to notice something is not right, after witnessing the carousel going backward. The effects are decent (but not great, even by the standard of the 80s). The pace is good, the atmosphere is nice (Miss Foley's ""nephew"" is really creepy) and the acting is all fine, especially Jason Robarts and Jonathan Pryce. After all the director is Jack Clayton, who made a great psychological thriller ""The Innocents.""

However, after the library scene the film suddenly becomes confusing, as if someone had decided to hurry the story and skip the key chapters of the original book. The pace suddenly becomes rushed; some parts of the film remain unexplained; Charles Halloway forget his broken wrist; Will suddenly wakes up; Dust Witch (played by Pam Grier, too brief time), very interesting role in the book, suddenly disappear.

I know changes care inevitable, but some things should not be removed from the original. ""Macbeth"" is not ""Macbeth"" without three witches. In film version of ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" almost everything about the Witch (including the riveting bullet catching scene of the book) is gone. As a result the undercurrent nature of the evil that was suggested in the book's final chapters (the Mirror Maze, etc.) becomes pointless. I'm afraid what happens in the film's concluding chapters only puzzles the viewers who haven't read the book. The film somehow manages to wrap up the story neatly with lots of special effects, but the logics and philosophy that are suggested in the film's earlier chapters are totally missing.

Ray Bradbury adapted his own book for the film and he is no stranger to the task of cutting and changing the source material. But I believe this was not what he and Jack Clayton really intended. The film is good, but is deeply flawed, telling us that here is a book that is waiting to be turned into film again.",1218844800,,2511,4.887323943661972
1351393,4,B00004TJFJ,"SWTWC is a problematic film for me, because I want wholeheartedly to love it, but several things about it give me some reservations.

To start off, let's take it as a given that Ray Bradbury comes very close to being an unfilmable author. His writing creates a very special atmosphere that wafts off the page and envelopes the reader from the opening sentences. That alone is extremely difficult to recreate on film, though of course, atmospheric filmaking is certainly not impossible. Unfortunately, SWTWC seems at times to strain a bit too hard in its sets, costumes and effects, to recreate the ""Bradbury mood"", as opposed to selecting suitably atmospheric natural locales, and letting things happen naturally from that. In other words, there's a bit too much of a reek of 'stage set' about the whole thing that I feel ultimately detracts from, rather than helps to build, the proper mood.

It's been noted elsewhere by much more competent reviewers than me, that Bradbury's dialogue, which reads beautifully and poetically on the printed page, often comes out sounding clunky and false when mouthed by actors. I'd say that statement applies here, with one notable exception, that of Jonathan Pryce. His performance comes extraordinarily close to making Bradbury's words sound real, convincing, and yes, menacing when spoken aloud. Partially, it's that incredible voice ('dark' is definitely the right word for it!) and mainly, just because Pryce is possibly one of the best actors around today--totally unknown to most American viewers when this film was released, he wouldn't get his real critical dues here until ""Brazil"", a film in which he was also excellent, and at the complete opposite spectrum of Mr. Dark. (View the two films back-to-back to get a good appreciation of Pryce's versatility. You'd hardly recognize him as the same actor between these films.)

Probably the single biggest drawback for me is the performances of the two young boys. I hate to say it, but these two come off as likely candidates for the most uncharismatic child performers on film of all time. Neither of them covinced me for one moment that they were caught up in, or believed what was happening, or felt any genuine sense of danger from Dark's attempted seductions (I mean the moral, not the physical, variety). Child performers need especially to be natural in their playing if they are to at all convince an audience, and neither youth looked for one moment as though he were doing anything but playing to the director's prompts. This detracted strongly from the atmosphere of threatened innocence that the film is intended to generate.

A second, lesser, cavil would have to be the performance of Jason Robards as the father. I'll admit up front that I have never been a huge fan of this particular actor. I by no means think he's bad--I've seen him give some quite good performances over the years--but I do feel he's a bit overrated, and a fairly far cry from The Great Elder Statesman Of Acting that he was often put forth as being. He's competent here, sometimes a shade more than that, but he's clearly outclassed by Pryce in their scenes together. Robards is definitely not at ease with the dialogue, and this is particularly noticeable in the 'deserted library' sequence where he faces off against Dark. Pryce gives off an air of real danger in his taunts and promises, making the viewer fully believe that Will's dad could be in imminent peril of falling prey to Dark's temptations, while Robards just stands there with a rather hangdog look over the fact that he's just been called an old man. We see no real sense of inner struggle on his part; I would say that this is possibly the best scene in the film, but it's due to Pryce alone, and not Robards, that this is so. The same could be said of a number of other scenes in which he (Pryce) interacts with the other performers. Pryce clearly feels the evil of Bradbury's conception, and displays it in his acting, where the others can't even come close.

I don't fault the special effects; they were actually quite good for what was available at the time, although, as not unusual with Disney live-action movies of this era, there's a perhaps too-noticeable 'animated' look to some of them. But all in all, they work well, and the glimpses of Grier's Dust Witch are quite spooky, even though the character seems to be used to no real purpose in the film, as opposed to the deeply symbolic place she held in the novel. But that again, tends to be a consequence of adapting books to film, that authorial subtleties are pretty frequently lost or jettisoned for script purposes.

My reservations to one side, I still rate this film pretty highly, mainly on the strength of Pryce's portrayal, and on the fact that it was a good effort to do true cinematic justice to Bradbury (it probably does remain one of the better film adaptation of one of his works to date). If the rest of the film could have come up to the real gold standard of Pryce's abilities, I have no doubt it would have become an out-of-the-ballpark classic of fantasy films; as it stands, it's still an entertaining, and at times pretty satisfying attempt.",1218326400,,5174,4.794843049327354

Jason Robards was one of the great theater actors in America.  He was noted for his interpretations of Eugene O'Neill's plays.  He adds a depth to this film in a supporting role.  Jonathan Pryce was still relatively unknown in the US but proved in this film that he is a force to reckon with.  Also in the film is Jack Dodson (Andy Griffith Show), Pam Grier (70's blaxploitation star) and Diane Ladd (Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore & Chinatown).

This was a film that Disney used to restart their family films.  It definitely had the needed edge but they were not able to successfully follow it up with another film of its quality.  This is definitely a quality adaptation of a Ray Bradbury novel.

Scared the hell out of me and insinuated itself into my dreams for weeks afterwards. My imagination worked at full blast, conjuring up images of all the places and people Bradburty created, and when this wonderful book finally made it to the big screen, I wasn't disappointed.

The boys, Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, are superb, as is Jason Robards as the tired old father still working late into the night at the library, guarded by the stone lions Mr. Holloway warned would prowl around the town one particularly windy night.

This movie belongs, however, to Jonathan Pryce, who takes and keeps command of the entire production. He is terrifying, remorseless and wonderful in his role, and very, very elegant which serves to lend even more horror to his madness. His voice and accent are fabulous and his walk, gestures, attire all work together to make him one of the more memorable Bradbury characters.

The various carnival creatures are so frightening and believable you are literally on the edge of your seat watching them...and wondering what they are capable of and what they will do next. No one, from the barber to the schoolteacher, is safe.

One of my favorite scenes is the one, late at night, in the library when Pryce, AKA Mr Dark of Cooger and Dark, hunts the boys...very, very scary stuff.

James Stacy is a sad figure; and very eloquent in his role as a former baseball great.

 From a small town somewhere in Greentown, Illinois, the stage name given for Ray Bradbury's own home town of Waukegan, Illinois comes a dark fantasy filled with evil characters who are out to take your soul in exchange for satisfying your deepest yearning.

This tale, at times lyrical, and the autumn scenes in October are almost symbolic of the end of life when you might regret unfulfilled dreams.

 On a dark stormy night, this carnival of pure evil comes into town and presents temptations for the people of Greentown, Illinois. James Nightshade and William Halloway are two curious little boys who feel compelled to climb out of their bedroom windows to go see Dark's Pandemonium Carnival being set up.

In this story the question is asked, if you had the choice to have anything you wanted in life, would you give up your soul to achieve your ultimate dream? Would you choose to be younger, richer or even wish to change the Past? ....................................................... All of the Greentown's folks deepest and most secret desires are met by the devilish inhabitants of the traveling fair and with dire consequences.

Talking about wo boys who were born on halloween at least one of them was, they had been best friends U'd think they where brothers I thought they where. They where two boys you would have to keep your eyes on and where very nosy. A carnival had come to town and not just any old carnival they had a carousel that they had been hidden in a tent and you already know who had seen it. This carousel wasn't any old carousel neither it was actually a time mahine and for people who wantd to change themselves it would for people who wanted to be younger it would make them younger but not normal and not what the people really wanted. This film was a very fictious story but was ok. Its nothing i would see again but worth the experience. It was really worth seeing also and i reccomed reading the book which is what i didi both had different endings and way more detailed then what I writing about and something you would have to read or see to really understand the concept to the story about how people try to change themsleves but what for these days people are so self cuncience about themselves and to think they are made that way for a reason. so tis movie also teaches you be who you re not what you aren't and become what you want not what you think. ~Shaun",1107993600,,1345,4.196911196911197

These two characters are a complement of each other, and at the same time they have a total different personality. Mr. Halloway is the person who always wants to do the right thing, and always tries to make everyone follow the right way. He kind of represents the light and the person who is brave enought to fight evil and destroy it.
Mr. Dark is the person who has the evil inside him.  The evil and all the bad and dark creatures have reincarnated in him, as a way to persuade good people and make them follow the path to their own destruction.
In the movie they have to fight agains each other representing the light and the dark, showing the power that each one of these have. Mr. Dark with the power of fear, badness,and envy.

With Shakespeare & Longfellow both quoted in the film & movie screenplay, penned and adapted by the author Ray Bradbury, how could you go wrong with this Disney Family great!

Set in the 1940's in a small idyllic town called Greentown, Illinois; it is the pseudonym for Ray Bradbury's own home town of Waukegan, Illinois. Waukegan plays quite a big role in most of Ray Bradbury's works, just as Bradbury had a pseudonym himself by the name of Douglas Spaulding.

Greentown is mentioned in passing several times in short stories, just for the reader to put a name to the place, but it is featured most prominently in ""Dandelion Wine"", a beautiful anthology Bradbury wrote concerning his childhood
memories, and in the dark fantasy novel, ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"".  So essentially, you COULD visit Greentown if you wanted to... Just be careful of the carnival ""Autumn People"" in October.

Jason Robards heads a stellar cast as the small town's middle-aged, midlife crisis cursed, librarian, Mr. Charles Halloway. Vidal Peterson plays Charles' son, the light, tow headed good boy, Will Halloway and Will's best friend, blood brother and alter-ego, the dark & brave Jim Nightshade, played by Shawn Carson.

This dynamically diametric duo get caught up in the carnival that literally blows into town, courtesy of a spooky black train, one fateful, autumn night.  ""Dark's Pandemonium & Carnival"" to be exact & the name does apt justice to the goings on all along the carnival grounds.

All of the Greentown folk's deepest and most secret desires are met by the devilish denizens of the travelling fair and with dire consequences.

Take in the sights and sounds of Mr. Dark's (a deliciously evil & seductive, Jonathan Price) Pandemonium Carnival, such as the beautiful dancing girls, the spooktacular and haunted Ferris Wheel, the fortune teller, the confusing ""House Of Mirrors"", gambling tables, the ""dust witch"" (Pam Grier) and the demonically charged, Merry-Go-Round/carousel that will take you on the ride of your life... Literally!

Diane Ladd plays single mother, Mrs. Nightshade while Ellen  Geer, daughter of the late Will Geer (Grandpa of The Waltons), portrays the mother of Will Halloway.

Someone HAS to save the citizens of small Greeentown from the ""Autumn People"" with their trickery, spells, evil powers and destructive ways.  Who will ""Step Right Up..."" just like the carnival barker bellows???

Watch this gem of a film and find out for yourself!

1351415,4,B00004TJFJ,"I remember seeing this spine tingling, movie adaption of Ray Bradbury's ""Something Wicked this Way Comes"" in it's original theatrical release, back in the early 1980's. It was among the Walt Disney studio's first attempts to put out more ""adult"" style content movies. While the film didn't perform all that great at the box office, it was still a well done movie, that just didn't seem to get it's proper due at the time. Now over twenty years later, ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" has arrived to the DVD format and has lost none of it's ""Twilight Zone""-like, thought provoking appeal. The story takes place during the Autumn season in a nostalgic 1920's era, Midwestern, small town. A father, Charles Hollaway(Jason Robards) his young son Will (Vidal Peterson) and  Jim Nightshade (Shawn Carson) begin their horrifying adventure, when a dark carnival pitches it's stakes on the outskirts of town. This macabre entertainment complex is run by a mysterious gentleman named Mr. Dark (Jonathan Pryce), who just might be the devil himself (or at least in league with old bezalbub).The  carnival and it's evil employees prey on the longings and temptations (money, women, beauty ETC.) of the local town's people. The carnival's answers to their dreams always turn out with nightmarish results. The  two boys find out the truth about the carnival and are soon on the run from Mr. Dark and his unholy minions. Their rescue and the town's salvation depends on Will's father's abilty to resist the offers of life, death & youth, that Mr. Dark both tempts and threatens him with. Ray Bradbury's story is really wonderful. It is part boy's adventure, part fantasy and part horror story. The language of Bradbury's script, almost has a poetic feel to it as discusses life, aging and the meaning of father-son relationships. It does this all while doing a pretty darn good job, scaring the pants off of us (witness the scene with all those tarantulas!). The casting of the film is wonderful. Jason Robards truely gives us a primer in the art of acting, when he takes Bradbury's words and gives them have an almost lyrical quality. The nuances in his performance are simply amazing! Jonathan Pryce also does a splendid job as the evil-incarnate, Mr. Dark. While his performance might be a drop over the top, he really does have a threatening quality, that makes for a great movie villian. I love the scene, where he comfronts Jason Robard's character in that large dark town library and literally proceeds to make, taking away years of life as easy as burning up pages of a book! Also look for a small but fine performance from actress, Pam Grier as the eerie, deathly, Dust Witch. Boy, I'd hate to meet her in a dark alley! If I have but one complaint about the film is that in this ""CGI Age"", the largely animated special affects have not really held up that well. But this really isn't a film about special affects. It's well written story and solid acting more then make up for it. The DVD presentation in both picture and sound are fine. The extras include only a single trailer. I would have loved to have seen a ""Making of Documentary"" or had a commentary track from Mr. Bradbury. Still, for an evening of scary, yet thought provoking entertainment, I highly recommend Ray Bradbury's ""Something Wicked This Way Comes""!",1096416000,,3314,4.810526315789474
1351416,3,B00004TJFJ,"""Something Wicked..."" is my favorite Bradbury book, and a book I enjoyed immensely when I first read it as a teenager. I'm not sure what drew me to it again, but I re-read it recently, and my husband decided to re-read it, too. We talked about the book for weeks afterward, recalling our favorite scenes and themes -- it just really stays with you. Then I remembered that a movie had been made, and I recalled Jason Robards being in it, but I remembered nothing else about it. I think I know why: it's because the movie is simply NOT the book. It's enjoyable, and if I'd never read the book, I probably would have thought it was great. But the boys whose lives, characters and friendship are so beautifully and vividly made real in the book never come alive in the movie. For me, that's partly due to the weakness of the young actors in the key roles of Will Hathaway and Jim Nightshade. Not only are they not equal to the material, the powerfully connected relationship so clearly established in the book doesn't translate to the screen. Thankfully, Jason Robards, as Will's father, Charlie Hathaway, and especially Jonathan Pryce, as the sinister Mr. Dark, are just excellent. Lots of things have been changed for the film (and mostly not for the better): characters are changed, or (oddly)added; key incidents are altered; and many of the most magical, fantastic and chilling things described in the book (pretty much everything having to do with the Dust Witch, for example) just don't have the same power onscreen. All of these changes are surprising given the fact that Bradbury adapted the screenplay himself. Having said all that, the movie is still entertaining, although I agree with other reviewers that this is not a film for young and/or impressionable children. It's still spooky, and some scenes do capture the creepiness of Bradbury's original work. And the movie does a fine job communicating the central theme about the saving power of love; in this case, between a boy and his father, and a boy and his best friend.",1096070400,,2034,4.748587570621469
1351417,4,B00004TJFJ,"Based on the best-selling 1962 novel by venerable SF and horror writer Ray Bradbury--who also penned this cinematic adaptation--1983's SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES is the unabashedly nostalgic story of two young boys, Will Halloway (Vidal Peterson) and Jim Nightshade (Shawn Carson), who engage in a battle of wills with Mr. Dark (Jonathan Pryce), the nefarious proprietor of a preternatural carnival that that literally blows into the boys' hometown one brisk October night (circa 1940).  When Will and Jim discover that Dark and his troupe of midway miscreants are hiding some evil secret that might endanger the town, the boys take it upon themselves to uncover the truth and protect their friends and neighbors.
Some viewers are surprised to learn that this somber film is a product of the Walt Disney Company.  Though there are the lovable small-town characters that one expects from Disney, it is admittedly rare to find a Disney flick with an incorrigibly evil character such as Mr. Dark (obviously the Devil in all but name).  It is also unusual for a Disney film to have such a grim atmosphere, at least one that is not regularly punctured with puerile comedic relief, but SOMETHING THIS WAY COMES has a consistently spooky ambiance and an earnestly frightening plot, both of which elevate it to the level of a genuine horror film DESPITE its Disney label.
The performances in SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES are top-notch.  Jonathan Pryce is deliciously wicked as the enigmatic Mr. Dark--genre fans might recognize Pryce as the actor playing Governor Swann in the 2003 blockbuster PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL--and Jason Robards does a fine turn as the wise librarian father of young Will.  Vidal Peterson and Shawn Carson, the two young actors portraying Will and Jim, are relative newcomers whose lack of substantial experience is an asset rather than a liability, as it actually adds to the realism of their characters' youthful innocence.  Some of the seasoned actors that fill supporting and background parts also contribute greatly to the quality of the film.  The gorgeous Pam Grier, star of several popular ""blaxploitation"" flicks in the 1970s, plays the carnival's witch-like fortune-teller; Diane Ladd plays Jim Nightshade's mother, a woman who is raising her son alone after both were abandoned by the boy's father; and Ellen Geer, daughter of the late Will Geer of TV's THE WALTONS, portrays the mother of Will Halloway.  Horror fans might recognize the late Royal Dano in the role of Tom Fury, the lightning-rod salesman.  During his lengthy career, the ubiquitous Dano appeared in such genre favorites as Hitchcock's THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY (1955), 7 FACES OF DR. LAO (1964), and KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE (1988); and also in episodes of genre TV shows like LOST IN SPACE, NIGHT GALLERY, AMAZING STORIES, and TWIN PEAKS.
Although the script does not have the same scope and attention to detail found in the novel, Bradbury has still done an exceptional job of translating to screenplay the novel's eerie essence and moral subtext.  And director Jack Clayton does almost as well in visually interpreting Bradbury's script.  He generates the perfect atmosphere for some genuinely creepy moments, and he is also quite adept at evoking Bradbury's primary theme of innocence lost.
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES generates most of its chills and scares the old-fashioned way--through atmosphere, suggestion, good plotting, and great characterization.  Unfortunately, the flick was originally released during the peak of the first big wave of slasher films in the early 1980s, and it was therefore unfairly ignored by moviegoers and panned by critics.  But thanks to the cool folks at Anchor Bay, this little beauty has a new lease on life via DVD.
Anchor Bay's disc is short on extras, offering only the theatrical trailer and the option of viewing in either pan-and-scan or 1.66:1 Letterbox formats.  But the digital transfer looks nearly pristine--even when viewed on a widescreen HDTV-- with only a few minor defects from the source print noticeable. In keeping with the subject matter, the film was shot with dark tones and subtle hues, and these come through wonderfully on the DVD.  Serious collectors of horror films on DVD won't want to let this genre gem slip away.",1079481600,,4326,5.099009900990099
1351418,5,B00004TJFJ,"I've read through several reviews and find myself in agreement with fans of this film. It is truly one of the most underrated films in Disney's library. Whether Disney has disowned it is questionable and I suspect there is a connection behind the scenes with Anchor Bay, just as there is (or was?) with Miramax Films.
The key to this film is that Bradbury captured the tone and flavor of his book perfectly. While nowhere near as complete as the book and the story told therein, it is, nonetheless, complete in and of itself. There's nothing missing for those who haven't read the book. But, if you liked the movie, go find a copy of his book and read it one dark and stormy night.
If you've seen some of the weird science before in other films, most likely it was because Bradbury wrote about it first. He is and was the Stephen King of his generation with such strange tales as The Illustrated Man and The Martian Chronicles (both are actually linked anthologies of his short stories).
If you haven't read the description of the film, it is a story about Middle America early in the first half of the Twentieth Century and two boys sharing their childhood. One comes from a respected, if unexciting family and the other from a less than honorable setting. Yet they live beyond their differences and hold on to their own special fantasies and memories in a Norman Rockwell sort of way. Life was simpler then than it is now, and yet it has its dark side, as the boys soon find out. Mr. Dark's Carnival has come to town in as mysterious way as it did in another time, many decades before, affecting all who became involved.
The film is deliciously handled with a flare that defies description, probably because Bradbury graced it with his retelling through the screenplay. Coupled with the compelling music that adds flavor and color to the outstanding cinematography, the film draws us into a Twilight Zone of the familiar and macabre.
The film is treated as one for children. It decidedly is not one for little ones who are half-awake, and yet the story is more disturbing to those who will think upon the hidden messages that are as old as time itself and what every parent dreads... What is to become of us? What is to become of our children? This is the very heart of the fear that is so omnipresent once the carnival arrives that dreadful night.
Don't just watch this story once. See it twice, but not on the same night. Give it some time to develop in your subconscious, and then, one autumn night, when the leaves are turning color, give it another look, ignoring the cliches it has spawned in other, later and lesser stories.",1077235200,,2633,4.556962025316456

Something Wicked This Way Comes is very scary. Not only have the censors totally misjudged this film but it is still classed as a children's movie! What rubbish! This is horror through and through, although albeit it can still be watched by kids but most adults will think twice about what they have just shown to them.
PARENTS SHOULD WATCH THIS BEFORE SHOWING IT TO THEIR KIDS.
This is not your average ""darker"" childern's flick like the Dark Crystal or the Black Caldron. It is much darker than that. I also remember a very graphic hand crushing scene.",1073779200,,647,4.586206896551724
1351420,5,B00004TJFJ,"Ray Bradbury is one of the greatest writers of all time - and I don't mean just science fiction.  His poems are some of the best around with their internal rhythm and universal themes.  The book opened like the movie -  a glimpse of an America of the past.  We are in middle Americana on a late summer day and it's time for the county fair.
Will and Jim, best friends, are excited about the upcoming event. Will's dad is the old, unexciting librarian who becomes a hero to his son.  This is a great tale for the whole family since it is not drenched in obscenity nor blood.  It's not really a whodunit since we all know that the evil Mr. Dark is the bad guy.
The ending is magnificent and the respect Will has for his dad - and the new self-respect his dad has for himself - makes this movie a morality story as well as an engrossing tale.",1068508800,,839,4.148148148148148

And, not being so technical a movie critic (such as the photography and casting), I didn't have any problem with the casting or cinematography.  I just liked the movie as it is.  OK, so maybe the bad guy is a hubba-hubba in my view, but it is the kids and Jason Robarts who make the movie.
If you like this movie, you might try to find a copy of Lady in White, too.  That is another little known terrific movie, also set in the past in a small town.",1064966400,,550,4.064814814814815
1351422,4,B00004TJFJ,"Ray Bradbury is a Midwesterner.  Many of his novels and short stories capture the flavor of the Midwest so well that it may be difficult for those who have grown up elsewhere to understand the feel of his stories, if not the meaning of the stories themselves.  Such is the case for ""Something Wicked this Way Comes.""
Our story is set in a turn-of-the-century small town in Illinois.  The time of year is autumn, a season often poetically exploited by Bradbury.  Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Carnival breezes into small-town Illinois one dark and dreary October day, and suddenly the waning day became even more dark than usual.  Thirteen year old Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade, best friends through thick and thin, are witness to the eerie arrival of a carnival set up but moments after the carnival train arrives.
The over-quick setup of the carnival is but one sign of the weirdness to come, as one person after another succumbs to the temptations presented by the carnival.  In one case, a woman longs for lost beauty.  In another, a man longs for lost love.  Another man longs for a lost leg.  The list is long, and while useful to establish the nature of the carnival, risks diluting the principal theme of the story.
At first only Will and Jim recognize the evil intent behind the carnival.  It is not long before Mr. Dark discovers that Will and Jim have recognized the true nature of the carnival, and then actively seeks to capture the boys and neutralize them.  Will and Jim are suddenly on the run for their lives.  Fortunately Jim's dad Charles Halloway, played by Jason Robards, is convinced of the nature of the carnival by the boys and helps the boys survive and overcome the evil of the carnival.
The story was originally released in 1962, significantly predating the much more serious and bloody Stephen King novel ""Needful Things,"" which pursued a similar approach in that the townspeople were tempted by their wants and succumbed, though in the latter novel accepting temptation generated further evil.  In ""Something Wicked"" accepting temptation leads to loss, but generally only personal loss.
The story is focused on the two boys, which makes the story better for teenagers, though I am very fond of the book and the movie even now.  Also, the story is set in rural Illinois, and autumn in the Midwest and Northeast have a feel very that can be a bit eerie, but difficult to understand unless you grew up in places where the leaves turn color and die in the fall as Halloween approaches, and there is a feeling of mystery in the air.  You might observe that this movie was not filmed in Illinois, which should have been obvious given that Illinois is generally flat throughout most of the state.
The movie was created in 1983 at a time when special effects technology was advancing quite rapidly.  The special effects in the movie are now dated somewhat, which detracts further from the movie.
In spite of the flaws in the movie, the feel of the book is still there.  When the movie starts with the view of the locomotive coming down the tracks, dark and vaguely foreboding, the tone of the movie is established.  Blowing leaves, dark colors and minor musical keys are used to enhance the feeling of the movie, which is more a dark fantasy than a horror story.  The movie allows a boy's viewpoint to explore the nature of life and temptation, which allows for more gasps and awe than we would feel as adults.  I recommend this movie for those who have enjoyed Bradbury in print, and are looking for a dark fantasy that approaches, but just misses the mark of real horror.",1064188800,,3597,4.6883942766295705
1351423,4,B00004TJFJ,"This is one of a few movies that is just perfect to watch on a Halloween night, even with the kids, it is rated PG, so maybe for the very young it might be too scary. Its not anthing horrifying but it dose entertain, Jonathan Pryce's perfromance as the evil Mr. Dark is perfect.",1063411200,,278,4.166666666666667
1351424,3,B00004TJFJ,"I have to admit that I haven't read the Ray Bradbury novel, so when I'm judging this film, I'm basing it on the film itself (which is what most people would be doing anyway).  This film is okay.  It's not over the top scary, and it's not boring.  There was an obvious attempt to make the people around the boys have deeper characters so you can understand why they suffer the fates they do.  Unfortunately, they are very two-dimensional and you neither feel sadness or glee over what happens to them.
  One thing I found strange about this film was the tarantulas scene (the one where the green mist follows the boys home and suddenly there are tarantulas in the one boy's room).  Has anyone noticed that the boys seem older in that scene?  It looks like they must have hit puberty because their voices are deeper and they are obviously taller/larger.  I wonder if they filmed that scene a year or so later to make the film even more disturbing?  It certainly stands out like a sore thumb, especially when the scenes before and after show the boys with their pre-pubescent voices and heights.
Overall, this is a movie that you'd probably want to rent first before going ahead and buying it.
One more thing - it's too bad that Anchor Bay didn't include a 'making of' featurette.  I noticed when looking on the IMDB for information about the film that there was a 'making of' featurette shown on TV back when the film was first released.",1057708800,,1435,4.523255813953488
1351425,5,B00004TJFJ,"What are Ray Bradbury's greatest works?  No, don't answer.  It's doubtful that the first baker's dozen of replies would produce two lists with the same works in the same order.  My first two choices are ""Dandelion Wine"" and ""Something Wicked This Way Comes,"" in that order.  SWTWC was the earlier book of the two.  Both achieve something that approaches uniqueness.  They capture an honest-to-god slice of life as it really was in the American Midwest in an era that faded by the advent of the 1960s - a time I was fortunate enough to have experienced when I was the age of the boys on center stage in these two books.  In ""Dandelion Wine"" one forgets all about Bradbury and starts to live his story.  The eyes read but the mind is in Illinois.  One sits in the summer night on the wooden swing of the front porch (people really did that once), hears the crickets chirping in the night and the steam train whistles singing their siren song as the great locomotives follow their tracks through a river valley somewhere near.  In the earlier ""Something Wicked,"" Bradbury nearly realized the same magic level of time travel.  The steam whistles also sing their song, but there's a chill on the Midwestern Wind and the smell of burning autumn leaves in the air.  ""Something Wicked"" has one more element that Bradbury no longer needed in ""Dandelion Wine,"" the supernatural.  As autumn leaves drift by their windows, two boys in Bradbury's Midwest do indeed hear the steam whistle blow, with the train bringing a fell carnival to town, one run by the Autumn People, a magical and devilish folk who thrive on other people's misery and unfulfilled desires.  So far, all of this applies equally in the original book and in the film, but here the two part and travel fascinatingly different paths.  With ""Something Wicked,"" Bradbury got an opportunity to tell his story a second time and in a different manner.  Both the book and the screenplay are by Bradbury, but the screenplay is anything but a film version of the book.  One really would expect more than that from Bradbury, and one gets more.  The central characters in the book are the two boys, Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, who encounter evil and with help from Will's father, the janitor at the local library, conquer it and advance on their own path to maturity.  In the film, Bradbury tells his story, really the same story again, but with an entirely different focus, now upon Will's father, Charles Holloway, who in this telling is the village librarian.  It's a story of an aging man who at last, in confrontation with the wickedness that has come his way, must deal with his own inadequacies, conquering them as he conquers the supernatural evil, with help, of course, from the boys, who use the lessons of his experience to advance on their own path to maturity.  Which is better, the book or the film?  That is the question, as Hamlet said.",1046044800,,2902,4.682445759368837

Now i thought the film was supurb, but so sinister and creepy, in fact i recall being more un-nerved by it, than some of the then ' Horror ' films around. certainly i felt it was unsuitable for many under 12 year olds. However, for me the film has a strange enchantment even though i still feel it is so sinister, i am pleased to have added it to my film collection.",1036972800,,663,4.107692307692307
1351427,3,B00004TJFJ,"I remember seeing this film when I was just a toddler and I remember being creeped out by it. Having seen it just recently as an adult, I can't understand why it bothered me. It's a harmless, fun little movie. This is a film based on the short story by Ray Bradbury. He also wrote the screenplay for the movie as well. The movie takes place at the turn of the century in a small, picturesque burg of Green Town. It looks like it could be somewhere in New England. It is October and the town and film has a very rustic, fall look. It looks real good. We meet two best pals named Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade. Both have father 'issues'. Jim's dad took off and Will's dad, the town librarian Charles Halloway(The always wonderful Jason Robards), is an older fellow with a bad heart. He feels bad that because of his condition and age(I'm guessing Robards was around 60 here, but the character might of been younger)he can't do the normal father/son thing with Will. He is also haunted by an incident a few years back that had someone else rescuing Will in a river while he only stood at the river bank and watched. The father/son arc between him and Will is touching and well done. It is the heart and soul of this film. Things turn weird when a strange man in black named Mr. Dark(Jonathan Pryce)shows up in town with his mysterious traveling carnival called ""Dark's Pandemonium Carnival"". This new attraction isn't what it seems to be. After some snooping around, our two young friends discover that Mr. Dark is truly evil. He lures innocent people in and feeds off their misery and pain. These people, in turn, become part of the traveling carnival. Once Mr. Dark sees the two boys witnessing something they shouldn't, they become his main targets. This being a Disney film, it is not violent, bloody, or scary. The father/son relationship runs through the whole movie and is the centerpiece. I also like how this film shows off the simple fun and adventures you had when you were a little kid. How these two boys get into mischief and stuff. It's like seeing yourself in your town during your childhood getting into things. I always like that in movies. The small town and it's quaint town square and nearby fields and woods are choreographed very nicely. Makes it really look like fall in whatever year it is supposed to be. Our main actors are all good. Especially Robards(naturally), and Pryce(as always). Pryce really gives off bad, evil vibes as Mr. Dark. A very mysterious presence. Robards was one of the best. I could just listen to his voice all the time. The young boys as Will and Jim are just fine, but they are nothing to write home about. Diane Ladd has a supporting role that is pretty much nothing. Same can be said for ""Foxy Brown"" star Pam Grier as the Dust Witch. Even though it's a small and ill fleshed out role, she brings mystery and beauty to the role. If only it were used for a bigger and more meaningful role. This is a nice little movie that is suitable for anyone of any age to watch. Especially on those cold, windy October nights. Having seen it again for the first time in 15 years or so, I realize what a pretty good movie it is. Wished I had re-discovered it a bit sooner. Check it out.",1031961600,,3225,4.467796610169492

1351431,5,B00004TJFJ,"I was never a great fan of Ray Bradbury's writings, but I loved
Something Wicked This Way Comes and looked for the movie on DVD regularly until it was issued.  The movie does full justice to
the book, and the special effects, while not spectacular (and
probably not intended to be) bring the story to life in a way
not often achieved.  The basic theme is selling one's soul to
the devil, not very original in the abstract, but Bradbury's treatment of the theme, and Disney's rendering of it in terrifying color, bring the story orders of magnitude beyond
the ordinary.  The lightning, a key element of the story, is,
alas, a bit phony in the strokes, but the white-lighting of the
landscape by the flashes are very realistic.  As a lover of
thunderstorms, I count this movie worthwhile for that alone.
Not having re-read the book for many years, I had to watch the
movie more than once to get a full grip on the plot details.  I would have liked more special features than just the theater trailer, but you can't have everything, and this disc comes with

1351434,4,B00004TJFJ,"Halloway and Nightshade...cool names for young boys to have.
I remember watching this movie back in school and having to write a report on all the imagery and allusions (and illusions) they worked into the plot...
Lots of things to think about here. You can analyze the movie and it becomes the story of an old man's desire to be younger so he can do more with his son; a boys desire to be older and better than his best friend; another boy's desire to just have fun, spend time with his father, learn, grown, etc blah blah blah. But I analyzed this when I was in school...now it's just time to enjoy it.
J. Pryce, while not doing his best work in this film, is the proprietor of dark's pandemonium. a hodge podge of exhibits in which each person sees some of their most personal desires, unfortunately those come at a price.
the old and bitter teacher of the school longs for those days when she was young and beautiful, so her wish is granted in the mirrors. unfortunately this comes at a price and she goes blind after becoming that young and beautiful woman that she loved to look at.
the carousel is of course the central theme of the movie. the carousel makes you older or younger based on which way it's turning. dark uses this to change his handyman into a little boy who goes to impersonate the teacher's nephew in town for a visit...it is later used for the destruction of dark.
whenever i see the movie i'm reminded of the song ulysses from dead can dance. it sounds like a haunted carousel spinning around and around, so while you're reading this review, go check out some albums from dead can dance :)
at any rate...a dark picture, sometimes the scenes on the dvd are very dim and you can't see very well...so don't watch the movie in a bright room or during the day. besides, you should always watch haunted movies in the night anyway, with maybe one candle burning behind you for effect.

1351435,5,B00004TJFJ,"If you had the choice to have anything you wanted in life, would you give up your soul to achieve your ultimate dream? Would you choose to be younger, richer or even wish to change the past?

Ray Bradbury presents a dark fantasy filled with sinister characters who are out to take your soul in exchange for fulfilling your deepest yearning. The script is at times almost poetic and the autumn scenes in October are almost symbolic of the end of life when you might regret unfulfilled dreams.

This vulnerable state of longing is what the ""autumn carnival people"" prey on. They feed off regret, vanity, delusions, sorrow and pain.

On a dark stormy night, this carnival of pure evil blows into town and presents temptations for the inhabitants of Green Town, Illinois. James Nightshade and William Halloway are naturally curious and feel compelled to climb out of their bedroom windows to go see the Dark's Pandemonium Carnival being set up.

James and Will are not as aware of the dangers of evil and seem like easy prey. When they realize there is something horrid going on, they try to warn the adults, who seem almost oblivious to the threat.

Together, they spy on Mr. Dark and find out exactly what is going on. When they get caught...Mr. Dark comes after them!

The library is their refuge and they hide in the bookshelves hoping to avoid certain death. I thought this was appropriate since truth and knowledge are like light, and darkness was about to consume them. The spiral staircase in the library reminded me of the staircase in my church when lived in Illinois as a child.

If you think this story is not a metaphor of real life, then you might want to look over your shoulder. Temptation is alive and well.

I could understand the difference if the screenplay had been written by someone else, but the way Bradbury has cut up his own work is beyond understanding. The main let down is the ending.

Pam Grier is a lovely vision as the Dust Witch, while character actor Royal Dano has a great little role as Tom Fury, the lightning rod salesman who holds the to the sinister carnival's destruction.

Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce are quite good in their adversarial roles.  The always-dependable Royal Dano gives support and a silent Pam Grier is seductive as the ""Dust Witch"" who appears in various forms throughout the flick.

The film is cast in the autumn (the autumn of life?) and a small town around turn of the century America (our dream of what America should  be?). Two boys, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade are excited to hear of a  carnival coming to town (remember our youth when autumn always brought some  sort of carnival to your town?). However, this carnival is no ordinary one.  It's proprieter, Mr. Dark, offers people what they desire most -- at a  fearsome price.
Jim and Will discover the underlying nature of Mr. Dark,  his menions and the carnival and end up as quarry for the mysterious,  sinister man. Will's father, Charles Halloway - the town librarian - is an  unlikely hero who faces his own fears and temptations to protect the two  youths from Mr. Dark.
Not really bloody or scary, I'd say the theme of  this movie (that of facing the realities of life) creates uneasiness  because of the familiar setting and its dealing with normal everyday people  and their dreams/wishes.
The movie is well done and entertaining.  Certainly worth a look. You might consider before allowing younger children  to view it - it would probably give them dreams.

The opening scenes perfectly sum up the spirit of autumn for me: the narration (accompanied by  James Horner's wistful and beautiful score) along with the photography of  the October landscape conjure up a rather melancholy longing for the past.  There are some great scenes showing the different ways people deal with  their own private sadnesses and regrets.  (And it makes you think, if the  dark carnival came to your town, what would you wish for?  On which  longings of your own would the carnival feed?)  The film is particularly  suited to viewing in October, but it isn't a Halloween story, and can be  enjoyed year-round.  Watch the film, but by all means view the LETTERBOXED  version!  Even though the black bands on the top and bottom of the screen  are minimal (the film wasn't shot in a very widescreen aspect ratio), the  letterboxed edition shows much more of the original film frame than does  the standard tv version--it makes a big difference (I've done a direct  comparison of the two versions)...Highly recommended!",940377600,,1167,4.745
