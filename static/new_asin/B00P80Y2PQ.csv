6788869,5,B00P80Y2PQ,A real awesome family movie. Such a rare thing these days.,1423872000,,58,4.363636363636363
6788870,2,B00P80Y2PQ,"Below average film with a not-so-subtle message about the superiority of public schools and a moral relativism, thinly veiled with a unrealistic coincidental spirituality and a nice explanation of the moves in a chess game.  The film-makers seemed to have a clear antireligous agenda, which is their right, but taints the viewing experience for those who would not comfort the children with the following advice (roughly spoken by the main character or her mentors): ""It's all just luck,"" ""I don't know where we're going to be after we die, but I we'll be together,"" ""Don't worry about the meaning of life, just enjoy it while you can.""  The main character's friend has two moms, and she imagines herself being happy with two dads--this is apparently meant to shape children's opinions on same-sex marriage .  Her grandmother appears to wear a cross and a beautiful church is visited--this is apparently meant to show that church is beautiful but mainly decorative.  The main character frequently expresses concern about death and dying, but is given advice to just not think about it.

With their decided effort not to appeal to a deity, the filmakers instead have the protagonist turn to the city for her advice, giving the film a hoaky and unrealistic blend of naturalism and spiritual coincidence.  She has visions of her deceased Grandmother to give her advice, which she entertains even though she realizes that they are just figments of her imagination.  While I enjoyed the plot of a tough chess player helping a young pupil, essentially the message of this film was to embrace pluralism and contemporary moral relativism.  If you have young children watch this film, they might not pick up on this message, but if you have a kid as smart and old as the main character in this film is supposed to be, it is impossible not to notice.",1423267200,17,1840,4.875

There were a couple of way-out tasks given; and I, who am an out-of-the-box thinker would have had problems seeing the answers to them.  The acting was excellent.  The dialog was good.  The characters were complex and fully developed.  The scenery was magnificent - great views of New York.  Narrated by several people at different times.  A struggling family with a brilliant child trying to give her the best education but not accomplishing family togetherness - the most valuable thing very well for a while.  A good plot.

8686707,4,B00P80Y2PQ,"The film is an independent gem of a movie with an all-star cast like Academy Award winners, F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis among the cast. Ralph Maachio and Janeane Garofalo played the parents of Max, a ten year old genius, who gets a chance to go to a private uptown school. Tovah Feldshuh played the principal. Rachel Dratch played the Aunt Diane. The cast is first rate with fine acting from the children. The story about a downtown girl studying uptown in a private school than a public school is cliche. Her parents go to great lengths to support the tuition. Max tried to fit in with her new surroundings and learns the valuable game of chess through the wise master, F. Murray Abraham, in the park. If only New York City's Greenwich Village was really like that today.

The DVD comes with a behind the scenes feature film and a blooper reel. I would have liked to have heard more from Rachel Dratch and Tovah Feldshuh. The film was done in 2014 and sadly overlooked.

8686712,1,B00P80Y2PQ,"This dreadful movie has all the makings of something better. However, whenever faced with a decision to improve or reduce the movie, director Evan Oppenheimer went with the lesser option.

Imagine the worst proselytizing Sunday School movie ever mixed with an ABC Afterschool Special. Make it valueless -- that is, do not allow for the actors to have any particular values. At least in Sunday School, you know the score.

Here's a few categories where Oppenheimer choked.
Writing - Example: when a character speaks, they used the other person's name. As such, dialogue felt forced.
Editing - The pacing of the movie droned on when it should've been tighter and it skipped over places, leaving me confused.
Acting - Find a stereotype (black or Jewish man in the park playing chess, two gay dads with a child, a private school girl, a Greek grandmother, an overworked mother) and exploit it.

The plot itself, in short, is whether a ""city"" girl can learn chess from a man in Washington Park (NYC) and exact spiteful revenge on the snotty rich girl. From there, it is a predictable humorless drama weakly using chess as a metaphor for life.

I love chess. That's why I watched it. Bad decision on my part.

When I first found out about the movie I was suspecting that it would be something along the lines of Searching for Bobby Fischer.  I was wrong.  The movie is a bit far fetched when it come to the story line.  Then the chess is basically not even legal moves.  The is one move where they say Rook to A4 in the opening and the rook moves to A5 calling it a great move, when the move made in the movie was illegal.  Nice idea but poorly executed movie.",1469404800,2,500,4.103092783505154

This is a movie about a ten year old girl named Max.  She has a little sister about 6 years old, a mother who is a chef, a father who is a superintendent, and a grandmother who dies early in the movie and visits her through hallucinations when she is half asleep.  There is an annoying narrator who comments from time to time.

The parents decide that they want to take Max out of her public school, where she has a 5 minute walk and a lot of friends, and put her into a private all-girl school with uniforms and a subway trip.  After making this decision for her, the parents then ask Max if she would like to go.  Max does not want to go, but they talk her into it.  However, they cannot afford it.  In order to pay the tuition, the mother must work longer hours and be away from home.

It didn't make sense to me that the parents would do this - - break up the family so that the mother is away and working long hours, the father has more responsibility with the two girls, and Max has to ride the subway (sometimes alone) to a school full of rich girls where she is only able to make one friend.  Were they planning on sending the little sister to that school also, at some point?  They definitely could not afford two tuitions.  Were they going to give ""the advantage of a better education"" to one daughter and not the other?  It would have made more sense for the parents to save money for the two girls to go to college, or even a private high school, later, rather than the fourth grade.

It was said that Max took care of her little sister after school.  Suddenly, Max stops taking care of her sister altogether.  Max is free after school to go anywhere unsupervised, and I was surprised that she didn't join any after-school programs in her new school.  The little sister suddenly stays alone in the apartment after school, for hours, and the father always says, ""Call me if you need me,"" while he works as a superintendent within their apartment building.

Max meets a strange man named Norman who spends his days sitting on a bench in a park, trying to get people to play chess with him for money.  Max never tells her parents about this man, which I found disturbing.  Norman teaches Max to play chess by giving her little life questions to solve, which were complicated and unclear, which they don't even discuss after she finds the answers.  In an attempt to figure out one of the questions, Max travels to Aqueduct, again never telling her parents.

Somehow, Max learns how to play chess.  She plays only one actual game, which is against a girl from the private school who hates her.  Max and the girl play this game, with the stakes that if Max loses, she will leave the private school.  Max purposely loses the game because she wants to leave the private school and go back to her public school.  At the end, we see Max being happy back at her public school (and the mother goes back to working normal hours), but we never see Max discuss leaving school with her parents, just like she didn't discuss anything else with them.

I thought that it was sad that Max couldn't just tell her parents that she was unhappy at the expensive school, and that Max never discussed anything with her parents - - there was clearly a communication problem between the parents and Max - - whenever the father would ask Max what she did at school, she would answer, ""Nothing,"" and he would just drop it.

I enjoyed this movie, despite the fact that Max and the little sister were often alone and in dangerous situations.  This movie needed a few funny scenes or positive scenes or something uplifting at the end.  Nothing interesting happens.  Even when Max goes to Aqueduct, it isn't shown, but only talked about for a moment afterward - - a lot could have been done with that scene.  This movie could have done a lot more, with the little sister, the grandmother, the school, etc., and there were a lot of short scenes that could have been added to.",1465516800,,3972,4.398630136986301
