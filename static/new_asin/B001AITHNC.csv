8277709,5,B001AITHNC,"I have all of Jims CDs , and catch him live when he is in Dallas when I can. He is one of a kind and does his own thing that is why I like the band. I have to keep replaceing his CDs because friends and family keep
taking them. When I need my fix Jim Suhler and Monkey Beat is where I get it. Check it out !",1431561600,,307,3.4
8277710,5,B001AITHNC,"The play list on this DVD are some of Jim's finest.  If you are a fan of Texas based blues\rock (I am) than buying this DVD is an automatic.  My only complaints are minor.  The video quality at times is not the best, but... Blu Ray spoils people.  The audio recording on the other hand is quite good.  You do not get to choose any audio set up from a menu, but ahhh the music is just too good to pass up.  This is an excellent band and if you can't see them live, this is definitely worth getting.  You may have to play with your home theatre sound field processing, but this DVD is just too good to pass up.",1336435200,2,608,3.975206611570248
8277711,5,B001AITHNC,"I never heard of this guy, but what a good Band this is! His opening version of Jimi Hendrix's ""Are You Experienced"" is worth the $22 alone. Wow! What a concert they put on. The Audio is solid, plenty of bass and drums added to superb guitar playing from Jim Suhler. I would put Jim Suhler along side Joe Bonamassa and Papa Chubby. The Video is clean and sharp, one of the better quality videos I've seen. I too, have elevated this to my top 10 DVD list. Trust me, this is one DVD to own and watch over and over.

I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio and Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product! Those who would still rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1276560000,2,1132,4.401913875598086
8277712,5,B001AITHNC,"I HAVE OVER 600 DVD CONCERTS IN MY COLLECTION AND THIS DVD HAS MADE MY TOP TEN LIST. AN AWESOME DISPLAY OF BLUES / ROCK GUITAR PLAYING.
