8658149,4,B00KESOWGQ,"This release offers excellent photos on the operation of the Shibanxi Narrow Gauge Railroad. Shows some nice scenes of the rural areas and small towns in this part of China. I can see why it's becoming a tourist area for the ""city"" folks of China.  The people in the film seemed friendly and the kids, well kids, are kids no matter what country they're from. Also showed the loading of the coal cars. I was surprised to see one woman pushing a loaded coal car up hill!!

The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is that there is no train ride  shown or English narration (no matter what the DVD case insert states) on the DVD I purchased. I really liked the short intro music, though.",1522713600,,684,4.328125
