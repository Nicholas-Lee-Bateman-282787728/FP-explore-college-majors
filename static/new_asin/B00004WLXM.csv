7925770,5,B00004WLXM,"I have several yoga video's, DVD/s etc., - this is by FAR the best one you will ever purchase.  Linda works alone.  It has
slow moves that are easy to complete.  She has a soft soothing voice and eases you into each pose.  Linda absolutely
loves yoga and it is visible.  You really should watch the entire video all the way through first time however, as Linda's one
drawback is ""because"" she  does  love Yoga so much - occasionally she is telling you the benefits of yoga - but has
forgot to tell you to move on into your next position in a pose.  You look up - and realize she has moved on ahead.
Once you view the video and do it a couple of times - you will realize where this happens.  Just wish she would have
this VHS - transferred to a DVD.  If she ever does, I will probably buy several to pass onto friends.",1391040000,,817,4.081761006289308
