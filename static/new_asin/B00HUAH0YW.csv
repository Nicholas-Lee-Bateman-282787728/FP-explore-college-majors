When I decided to exile myself from the Church I was born in and loved, I was only concerned with the sex abuse scandal.  There's more, much more and I cry and my heart bleeds for what vile men have done to what could have been an outstanding institution for good.  Maybe God will be able to forgive them; I never will.

I wish thre was a Volume 2
I don't think all the Vatican/Catholic church secrets have been told yet at all
We can hear it...just bring it on!
It is a must see....I watched it twice as I knew I was just not able to digest it all in one setting",1402876800,11,377,4.04
6208313,5,B00HUAH0YW,"I thought this documentary would contain a few instances of abuse, maybe some more positive antidotes, perhaps details about how the Popes staff works,etc. but this! I sat riveted and astounded- mesmerized! It has been along time since anything shocked me even a little, but i was shocked. Also saddened, and i am not a Catholic. Apparently Human Beings, whether secular or religious, are capable of all sorts of abuse of power,  tentacles of dishonesty stretching into most aspects of this Church as they have into many other organizations in the past. Surely the Cardinals knew about most of it. One wonders who voted for Pope Frances and why and who did not want to elect him and their reasons. I would watch another documentary about that alone, who the Cardinals are who elected this interesting Pope and who fought it. My interest in everything about the Vatican has been awakened, so truly, film makers, create more!
  I highly recommend this film. Besides being a shocker, its well made, thought provoking and understandable by everyone. No children, though, below 16 or so. I am hoping for more film, follow ups, etc. And also for positives about the Vatican. I am sure that there are many of those,too, just as intriguing.
  Bravo, Frontline, BRAVO!!!",1395964800,23,1261,4.901408450704225
6208314,5,B00HUAH0YW,"This is currently available in streaming format. I highly recommend.
I read some reviews elsewhere that tried to say this was ""church bashing"". But the problem is that even bad reviews admit that the abuse atrocities are all true. But some claim that the documentary uses music and edited context to ""put the church in a bad light"".
I think that if anybody is more offended by the music than they are by well established stories of corruption and cruel abuse, then maybe they aren't really interested in the church becoming trustworthy.",1395014400,13,536,4.836956521739131

Many of the issues that Pope Benedict had to deal with during his service was not really analyzed and discussed in media as it should have been and this documentary certainly covers that era considerably. Priests are human beings who have to deal with many issues and regardless how spiritual they may want to be or they may want to get, they still cannot avoid arrogance, sexuality, greed and evil of all, money and power as Scarface used to say. I do not remember how those two hours went by watching this documentary since I had to watch this documentary more than once. So informative and well done that I forgot I was watching a documentary although it is a documentary but it has so many segments in different genres related to each other that it is difficult to remember that not only this is about a religious institution with some 1.3B followers but leaders so disgusting that this documentary could actually be made in regard to their actions.

After all these incidents documented in these documentaries in 2004, 2006, and 2014 anyone with any reasonable IQ should be able to figure that if all those sexual abuses were not addressed by the Vatican then for decades if not for centuries, none will ever be addressed in future either.

Watching the Catholic Church in action, I wondered how anyone could even belong to a business, a faith, a church, an organization or whatever when even one of their representatives would do what many of Vatican's priests in Catholic Church have done to many of their members, their victims regardless of their sexual orientation or age. Where are the members who have suffered as well as their loved ones... why are not they writing reviews, why are not they expressing their dissatisfaction, anger and pain... Vatican has figured the same thing that politicians have figured all over the world. Without the members of the church demanding justice, there would be no change which is no different to what is happening to our Congress... NO CHANGE. Watching those victims telling their story of abuse is so shocking, disgusting, disturbing and painful. Watching the priest analyze whose penis went where in his deposition is so unexpected that I wonder how could anyone walk in a church knowing that those people keep doing what they have without a change.

6208365,5,B00HUAH0YW,"This episode of PBS Frontline is centered on the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI - the first pope to resign in 600 years in the history of the Catholic Church - as his papacy was rocked with scandals and challenges that includes sexual abuse committed by priests;the corruption that existed in the Vatican Bank; and the release of internal documents known as the VatiLeaks which exposes the cronyism and power struggles within the Vatican.

Anthony Thomas provides an informative and thought-provoking documentary that exposes the Catholic Church particularly the Vatican during the papacy of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger,better known as Benedict XVI.It starts with the pedophilia and fornication committed by the clergy as well as the homosexuality that existed among them. It highlights how the vow of celibacy has been challenging to adhere to in the modern world. Also,it provides us reports of how sexual abuse complaints particularly against the minors made against the clergy were suppressed by the Vatican.

Sadly,the same action was taken by the Holy See when the Vatican Bank and the Vatican itself was rocked by issues of corruption that includes bribery,profiteering and money laundering. Too bad that the law cannot applied to them as the Vatican exists as a nation of its own that is why the cover-up of these scandals has been effectively made. In the end,it was concluded that Cardinal Ratzinger decided to resign his post as Pope as he was unable to do much about this problems thereby giving way to the election of the new pope - Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio or better known as Pope Francis,who will now be tasked to make changes during in his papacy.

The Catholic Church has known to have a great legacy in the history of the world particularly in education and charity. Too bad that the scandals that have rocked the church has somehow tainted it. No question that it has faced many challenges in the modern world particularly when it comes to the vow of celibacy. Should the clergy remain celibate for the rest of their life or should they be allowed to marry or be in relationships to weed out these scandals of sexual abuse?It was stated that sexual abuse among Catholic clergy greatly outnumbers that from other Christian denomination. As for the Vatican bureaucracy,will the new pope - Pope Francis - be courageous enough to institute reforms to weed out corruption amidst the opposition that he will probably face from fellow priests and powerful influential forces of the Vatican Curia?These are the questions that we hope that the new pope will find answers as it charts a new course and to regain its credibility for the sake of the Catholic Church and its 1.25 billion Catholics around the world.",1446508800,,2721,4.962719298245614

6208396,1,B00HUAH0YW,"This is perhaps the most biased investigation I have ever seen. There is quite literally not a single statistic used, not ever are facts presented and explained. Instead, the producers interview only people who have very strong biases against the church, including a lawyer who has made a career by bringing cases against the church as well as priests like Fr. Doyle who are on the fringe of the church. Most of the arguments against the church that are presented are based on anecdotal evidence at best...and wild accusations at worst. The only credit I can give to the producers is for its portrayal of the corruption with the Vatican bank, which I don't doubt exists. The stories presented on sex abuse in the church is obviously extremely terrible, but the program's attempt to pin every scandalous incident on the Vatican and consequently the pope is absurd. While the transfers of priests (a practice that was obviously stopped when it came to light years ago) is appalling to watch as a Catholic, the program cannot seem to grasp the idea that bad people are going to exist in an organization that is so vast. The producers also show a clip of a professor who makes the claim that priest abuse cases vastly outnumber abuse cases by Protestant pastors. Of course, no statistics are provided. His assertion is simply not true. The reverse is true. The program also attempts to paint Benedict XVI in a bad light in respect to the sex abuse scandals, yet it makes no effort to point out the many changes that he carried out while pope, especially in response to the scandals. While I cannot defend the many problems the church is facing (and there are many), this program does a poor job of covering them. This program is called the ""Secrets of the Vatican,"" and it claims to reveal secret documents in secret archives of the Vatican, yet fails to mention that those ""secret"" archives are actually available to academics. Manipulation of information at its best here. ""Secrets of the Vatican"" is frankly a piece of propaganda aimed at everyday Americans who do not check facts and blindly believe whatever they hear.",1420761600,6,2119,4.776566757493188
