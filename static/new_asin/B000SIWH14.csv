2884985,5,B000SIWH14,"At 17 months old, my son has and incredibly large vocabulary and I credit this video for much of it.  The content is incredible, entertaining and packed with an enormous amount of age appropriate information.  My son will hardly sit for any other video or movie, but is glued to this one the whole time.",1199923200,,303,4.490909090909091
2884986,5,B000SIWH14,"My son is 2 1/2 and receives speech therapy.  He loves this video.  He is learning to sing the songs that Mallory sings in the video.  After watching it several times, he is excited to answer the questions during the finding games.  I also enjoy this.  It teaches good manners in a caring and fun way.",1196726400,2,301,4.303571428571429
2884987,5,B000SIWH14,My wife and I bought this for our 4 year granddaughter.  I thought it might be too young for her.  I was mistaken the quality of the DVD is excellent and my granddaughter played it over and over.  She interacted with DVD and thoroughtly enjoyed it.,1196208000,2,248,4.3478260869565215
2884988,3,B000SIWH14,"My daughter enjoyed this video very much! She wanted to watch it many times. It did help her with saying a few new words - please, thank you and peek-a-boo. I found it somewhat boring in that it presents the material in the same way over and over, but I guess the repetition is the key for children's understanding. Also, the singing isn't the best quality. Cute, but not what I thought I was purchasing.",1194480000,2,404,4.4
2884989,5,B000SIWH14,My daughter is 2 1/2 and hardly talks.  She attends speech therapy but nothing has worked. Until I got this. She loves the peek-a-boo and even does the sounding out of letters. Its a God send!,1193443200,2,192,4.333333333333333
2884990,3,B000SIWH14,"I know this has great reviews but I just thought it was alright.  My 11 month old was uninterested and my 3 1/2 yr old was only mildly interested.  I cannot imagine who the format is aimed at.  The video shows 3 pictures in a bubble and then says, ""can you find the duck?"".  Then the duck is a highlighted.  However, for little ones learning new words the background is too busy for them to focus on the objects in the bubble.  And for older ones the concepts are elementary.  I just wasn't overly impressed with the the way it was set up.  But like any other children's video, what works for one child may not work for another.  So maybe it is just better suited for someone else's children.",1192924800,6,692,4.2615384615384615
2884991,5,B000SIWH14,My twins Love this. I love how they are corrected and manners are a focus.,1191024000,3,74,4.0
2884992,5,B000SIWH14,MALLORY LEWIS IS SUCH A TALENTED PERFORMER -- kids and young ones can't take their eyes off this wonderful learning and entertaining DVd.  I hightly recommend it for every mom and every child.  The music and songs are  fabulous and the characters are adorable.  It is a must buy.,1190592000,2,279,4.63265306122449
2884993,5,B000SIWH14,"If you liked Shari Lewis, you'll love her daughter Mallory. Mallory has lept off from where her famous Mom left off. She is an outstanding ventroloquist and performer and introduces her new puppet Giggles in this well constructed program teaching vocabulry to pre-schoolers. Recent studies have shown that the key difference in school readiness between low and middle income children is vocabulary. I think the more we can expose our kids to an expanded vocabulary, the better prepared they are for school and for life! And, on top of that, it's fun.",1188172800,4,550,4.989130434782608
2884994,4,B000SIWH14,"I'm a father of 3, My wife & i bought this for our oldest son, who had a huge speech delay & was diagnosised with Autism, We got this dvd when he was 2, he barely spoke any words at the time, he is now going on 4, and he still loves the video, and can say all the words & sing the songs, he still has a speech delay, My middle child is 2 now, has been watching the video from the time he was 1, and i think it really helped with his speech development. he talks fine, & i cant wait for my 3 month old to be old enough to watch it. we really really love the dvd really catches their attention, however i dislike the stupid song/photo slide show of the guys kid, that part is a little annoying.",1254268800,,692,3.8125
2884995,5,B000SIWH14,"I watch this DVD with my 1 year old grandson and we love it.  The songs are entergetic and the presenter comes across as friendly and real.
When I sing the songs (away from the DVD) my grandson starts to bounce and get excited.  We really like the ""identify the object"" sections and the  sections where the children are playing and/or exercising.
We have enjoyed this so much, that we misplaced it and had to buy another....5 stars easy!",1250380800,2,437,4.506329113924051
2884996,5,B000SIWH14,"My son does not like ANY other TV or videos for more than two minutes.  Ever since we got this, he watches it beginning to end every day and has started to call out the names of the pictures. This is the one thing that stops him in his tracks and draws him in ... no matter what he is doing. The show is colorful, fun and very entertaining.  My nanny is even using it to learn English words.  I love this DVD!!!!  I wish there were more than just the few that I've found for sale!  I'd buy them all!",1236988800,,499,3.900990099009901
2884997,4,B000SIWH14,"I showed this to my son when he was 14 months and he wasn't into it, but when we watched it again when he was 20 months he absolutely adored it! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I find it incredibly annoying, and while it IS well-designed for toddlers I am with him all day and therefore I also have to watch it! He had already learned his phonics and letters from Leapfrog's Letter Factory and They Might Be Giant's ""Here Come The ABC's,"" (much less annoying for me) but he loves this because of the mini quizzes throughout. I agree with the other reviewers that it's nice that they include teaching manners in this DVD. All in all, it's a decent DVD if you are trying to teach your child and you don't mind the format.",1233619200,,722,4.239130434782608
2884998,2,B000SIWH14,"i'm seeing all these rave reviews for this dvd, but i thought it was pretty lame. i realize the dvd wasn't targeted towards me, but even my 18 month old seemes to agree with me. the ""tummy tots"" are irritating to say the least, and i don't really care for the way that she introduces the different words. the baby einstein videos seem to be more effective and my son definitely enjoys them more...maybe i should watch this one again with my son and see if there's something we missed.....???",1225843200,,491,4.466666666666667
2884999,4,B000SIWH14,"This DVD is enjoyable, educational, and well worth the money.  It teaches manners (""please and thank you"" kind of stuff), but the ""baby"" puppet does ""dare"" to say ""no"" at times and needs a little (fun and gentle) encouragement to cooperate.  If you are the type to be easily offended by a child telling an adult ""no"" now and then, this might not be for you.  (It could get your kid in trouble with you if he/she repeats some of ""Giggles'"" dialogue).  I'm a little worried that some poor little kids might even end up getting smacked around when they repeat in a ""Giggles the puppet"" voice, ""What part of no don't you understand?"".  This series was designed by people trained in child development, who probably didn't take into account that there are still plenty of hitters out there, who would... er... um...""discipline"" before they even stopped to think.",1217808000,,856,4.718120805369128
2885000,5,B000SIWH14,"Our daughter has been watching this movie CONSTANTLY for about 2 months (she'll be 2 yrs old at the end of this month).  It is perfect for early learning - she's now telling us that ""R says 'Errr'"" and many other letter sounds.  That alone makes this a great educational tool, but it also reinforces many of the life skills we've been teaching (using her ""words"" instead of screaming when she wants something, saying ""please and thank you"", being patient, etc).  I really can't say enough GOOD about this movie.  This is a must have for any toddler!!  I just wish we had found the movie earlier :)",1205712000,,597,4.4907407407407405
2885001,5,B000SIWH14,My two year old grandson can't tear himself away from this DVD! It will probably drive parents nuts because of the repetition but that is how children learn. His mom said he loved it so that I bought the Phonics for Babies color and shapes follow-up DVD for him. Keep in mind that we adults can see the best movie or performance in the world yet we don't care to see it again for some time whereas a child will watch a movie 100 times in a row. I entertained children professionally for over 20 yrs. and kids under the age of 5 are like that. This imprinting is how they are taught. I'm glad I found something that connected so well with a two yr. old.,1205107200,,652,4.141732283464567
2885002,5,B000SIWH14,"This is the first DVD I ever purchased for my daughter.  She watched it for the first time when she was about a year old.  Now, a year later its still one of her favorites.  It teaches phonics, letter recognition, and object recognition.  The songs are great!  My daughter learned the words: ""hello,"" ""please,"" and ""thank you"" within a week of us owning the video.  She has learned a lot from this video.  The only objection I have with this video is that the main puppet named ""Giggles"" tells his mom ""no, no, no"" several times when she asks him to do something.  That's one word and behavior that I don't want my daughter to learn!  Overall though, it's a great video!",1204934400,,670,4.426229508196721
2885003,5,B000SIWH14,"My son isn't much of a talker, so I wanted a DVD that would encourage more words.  Up until now he would only watch Veggie Tales and would cry if I tried to get him to watch other things. But he love Mallory Lewis, she has the same gift as her late mother Shari.  My son loves her and can't take his eyes off the screen. And he's trying to talk a lot more these days, I usually get a few new words a day.  This video has been a big help!",1202860800,,437,3.7282608695652173

8205365,5,B000SIWH14,She wore out the last copy so we had to buy another. We would love more vidios from Malory Lewis!,1393459200,,97,3.9
8205366,5,B000SIWH14,It is a very cool DVD to help kids learn phonics. Funny songs that ecourage young kids to repeat them.,1379289600,,102,4.15
8205367,4,B000SIWH14,"This video is full of fun songs and good lessons. My son stays interested and really enjoys it! The gals tone of her talking voice can be a little off putting at times, but it's a kids video :) all and all I highly recommend it to moms with kids who love music and fun. Enjoy!",1332720000,,276,3.9464285714285716
8205368,5,B000SIWH14,"My baby loves this video.  We are also doing Your Baby Can Read and she loves that as well.  She will not sit and watch cartoons, maybe because we really didn't allow her to watch TV until she was 18 months, so I was really excited to see her watch this and learning.",1325548800,,267,4.018867924528302
8205369,5,B000SIWH14,"my daughter and I both love this!  the songs are incredibly addicting, I've been sitting at work singing them all day!  We've only watched it maybe 4 or 5 times, but I can see it helping her learn more words and sounds of the letters.  she's already started saying peekaboo alot! :)",1315267200,,282,4.384615384615385
8205370,1,B000SIWH14,"I cannot imagine where these good reviews are coming from. I buy hundreds of books and DVDs from Amazon each year, but I am too busy to write reviews unless I think the product is gravely misrepresented. My child has a hearing disability: I have had speech therapists from one of the best programs in the country come to my house every week to work with my child, I have read countless books (I am a college professor), attended Hanen Program classes every week to learn how to encourage speech, and I have purchased many of these ""vocabulary building"" videos. This one was ridiculously bad: very low production quality, and useless in terms of content. The people who made this video, though they might be well intentioned, have no idea what they were doing in terms of developing speech. It is almost a joke in terms of how unprofessional and self-indulgent it was: there is actually a long (I shut it off after a few minutes) home movie of the performer's child at the end, with a song written for her, the kind that only this kid's grandparents would want to watch! Baby Babble DVDs are excellent... designed by actual speech pathologists... they echo the approach that I have seen/experienced/read about from so many sources. Don't waste your money here.",1313366400,6,1259,4.7272727272727275
8205371,5,B000SIWH14,"I bought four DVDs aimed at teaching babies words:  Brainy Baby, Bee Smart, Baby Babble, and this one.  My daughter quickly got bored with the first three but continues to love Phonics for Babies.  The others are slow paced and, for the most part, use just one basic technique:  a word (for ex. ""train"") is repeated several times while the item is being pictured.  Baby Babble is a little more complex as it also has clips of speech therapists making various sounds and some interesting toys.  Phonics for Babies is much livelier than the other three DVDs and has music, puppets, and teaches more than just words - also phonics, counting, manners, etc. The stars of the show are a puppet named Giggles, which my daughter adores, and the actress Mallory Lewis, who is the puppet's ""mother.""  They sing a variety of catchy songs together which really makes this DVD enjoyable in addition to educational.  If you watch the entire DVD you will find that after the credits there is a second show about as long as the first one.  So you are essentially getting two for the price of one.  We also bought another DVD with Giggles and Mallory Lewis, which is about colors and counting.  My daughter loves that one just as much.",1297036800,3,1218,4.618604651162791
8205372,1,B000SIWH14,"This DVD was painfully bad.  It looked like someone created it in their garage and the content was weak.  If you're used to DVDs like ""Baby Einstein"" or even ""Baby Babble"", you're unlikely to be satisfied with this.",1286409600,,215,4.631578947368421
8205373,4,B000SIWH14,"My daughter loves the tummy tots,She is 2yrs old. She sings the songs please ,please ,please & thank you & all the other cute songs .They are all good learning tools for a child.
I hope she continues with older kids like for pre-k that would be great!",1261958400,,251,4.25
