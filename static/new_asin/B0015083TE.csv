8256858,5,B0015083TE,"I love this series. From the first episode until the last it delivered every time. I have favorite episodes, of course, but when rating the series as a whole, I give it 5 stars. Being able to buy it as a Region 2 was also a plus, it was cheaper than Region 1. My purchase of a region-free DVD player is the best buy I've made it a long time.",1487116800,,341,3.8857142857142857
8256859,2,B0015083TE,I am so tired of the fighting and abusive treatment going on between the characters. The writers must be bored too. If you like mysteries don't bother with this series-it's more about relationships running amuck.,1326931200,4,212,5.085714285714285
8256860,5,B0015083TE,"Definetly, the bbc has wonderful series.  Waking the dead is great, intresting and best of all, they do not use weapons.",1271289600,6,120,4.714285714285714
8256861,4,B0015083TE,"The good stuff.....Season Six has some of the best storylines with jaw dropping suprises, fun detecting and some outrageously clever interrogation scenes. The writers are still taking some chances and it is refreshing to see that a predictable formula coma has NOT set in yet. The episode titled ""The Fall"" is one of the best of the
entire catalog.

The disturbing changes....The dialog and interaction between the cold case unit officers is becoming more Americanized soap opera. The atmosphere and the flavor of the show is changing. Depending on what you like this maybe good or bad.

Some of these episodes include a very corny and contrived falling out between Boyd and Grace. Be prepared to see some VERY bad acting with Boyd yelling his head off over not shutting the door or unsurping his authority over the wrong type of sandwich bread.

The new actress that plays the third pathologist in the series is very good but cannot hold a candle to Frankie. Frankie, I miss you, please come back.",1254355200,19,998,4.824561403508772
