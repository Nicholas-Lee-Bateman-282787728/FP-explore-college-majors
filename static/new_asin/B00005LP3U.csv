7944158,5,B00005LP3U,"This is an excellent ""Godfrey Ho"" style movie. If you like cut-and-paste hilarious scenes then you'll love this. Jam-packed with awkward dubbing, lifted soundtracks and combining 3 movies into one, this masterpiece will have you laughing your ass off. A must-see for anyone who enjoys Z-grade movies done with style.",1436313600,,316,5.34
7944159,1,B00005LP3U,"This is not an old school gong fu movie.... It's a try-to-be- camp failure on all levels.  Don't buy unless you want to be really angry and gong fu chop someone for catharsis (spelling?).

STAY AWAY!",1154736000,3,199,4.5
