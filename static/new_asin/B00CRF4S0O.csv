I feel fortunate to have known nothing about this 2013 film when I stumbled across it on a streaming service, whose synopsis did not blow surprises, the other day.  YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL takes us places I, for one, would not have predicted but director Franois Ozon's sense of narrative and pacing already had me engrossed before the first eye-widening moment.

The story of a year in the life of a French teen-age girl, while every bit the melodrama YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL holds back on telling us why it unfolds as it does.  Instead, the film proves content to leave us to ask, why couldn't this happen?  Like all young people, protagonist teen-ager Isabelle needs to be lectured less and listened to more.

So, if you've already heard too much about the story, don't feel as if it's ruined.  But if you haven't, that's all the more reason to avoid reading more about YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL until after you see it.",1410048000,4,1062,4.666666666666667

5735285,4,B00CRF4S0O,"Franois Ozons Young & Beautiful - a film that won't add up, well didn't for me. As time passes you believe you have the measure of it, but on further reflection the overall picture is somewhat inexplicable. A film concerned with female sexuality, chiefly in its nascent stages, and as such we the audience will be left puzzled. It centres on a Parisian teenager called Isabelle, played French actress Marine Vacth. She has a certain deportment  not unlike Catherine Deneuves in Belle de Jour  that suggests she alone knows the answers and isn't telling.

As the film opens we meet Isabelle is on holiday with her family - on the eve of her 17th birthday, and she has decided to celebrate it by losing her virginity to a young German called Felix. An event, which for her, seems less of significance than she originally expected. Then the film jumps in time and family have returned to Paris: Isabelle, we discover, has turned to prostitution, a decision that the audience are never given a reason for. As the film moves on we are then, rather like voyeurs, given glimpses of her hotel room dealings.

After one, of her elderly customer experiences fatal heart attack during a liaison  she comes to the attention of the police, and this then leads to her mother finding out about her work. The audience are then shown the cash that she receives from her activities  as it simply piles up in her bedroom cupboard, it is obvious that money was not a motivator for her actions.

For me the film works because it withholds that tantalizing answer of why she embarked on the path she had chosen: even when we learn of the event that lured Isabelle to prostitution was  just idly fascination. We leave the film without a real solution.",1406505600,,1728,4.642622950819672
5735286,5,B00CRF4S0O,"Beautiful movie, this movie could have been disgusting because of the theme but it was so well done.  Francois Ozon did a wonderful job as a director.  Marine Vacth is amazing in this film, she is in every scene and read that this is her 3rd film, she is a wonderful actress.  Not much dialogue by Marine but just looking at her face you knew what she conveys.  The rest of the cast also did a wonderful job.  I also have fallen for Johan Leysen, he is one heck of good-looking man.  Marine is a beautiful young woman. Love the relationship with her brother, Victor in the movie.

This film is a superb film better than Blue is the Warmest Color.  Cannot understand why that film won the Palm d' or and not Jeune & Jolie. But I think the reason Blue is the Warmest Color won was because of the long, long, sex scenes that got quite boring plus at 2 hours and 59 minutes quite too long.  It could have been a movie of the week.

Towards the end of the movie, Charlotte Rampling also did a wonderful job.  Her character was needed to explain Georges (Johan Leysen) and I do kind of agree on what she said about being a call girl.  She freed Isabell from her guilt.

I also bought the soundtrack of this movie.  I would suggest that you should buy it if you buy the movie.  It is a great soundtrack.",1404259200,,1296,4.190283400809717
5735287,4,B00CRF4S0O,"Described by one reviewer as a coming-of-age film, JEUNE ET JOLIE could be seen as quite the reverse.  Indeed, we might almost consider the title an irony, as the film focuses on the experience of sixteen-year-old Isabelle (Marine Vacth), who loses her virginity to a German boy named Felix (Lucas Prisor) while on holiday, and subsequently embarks on a career as a call-girl on her return to Paris, with a particular penchant for older men.  Neither of her well-to-do parents know about her secret double life, even though her behavior becomes rather erratic.  Despite her abilities to make a lot of money quickly, Isabelle does not seem very happy with her life; the sexual act has little or no allure for her.  It is only when she is inadvertently responsible for the death of elderly business person Georges  (Johan Leysen), that she begins to exhibit any real human feeling.  Although vowing to give up her call-girl existence, once her parents have found out, it seems unlikely that Isabelle will honor her promise - until she meets Georges' widow Alice (Charlotte Rampling), and learns something of the truth about his life.  Director Francois Ozon makes no judgment on Isabelle's behavior, but shows the fundamentally sterile nature of the teenager's world, whether in school or in a series of increasingly anonymous hotel rooms.  It seems as if she has little or nothing to look forward to, despite her parents' ambitions for her.  Maybe she just has to follow Alice's example and accept her fate.",1400630400,24,1506,4.944444444444445
5735288,4,B00CRF4S0O,"Young and Beautiful is the latest film from Franois Ozon (`In the house' and `Potische') he has a flair for great camera work and being able to tell a story effortlessly. This time he has made quite a dark tale. It is about Isabelle (Marine Vatch in her first big screen outing) who is very young and very beautiful. So on a summer holiday with her family she meets suave German Felix. He talks his way into getting what he wants and then she just drops him. What at first looks like being a bit of a disaster for her in the self gratification department soon takes on an unusual twist.

She decides to live a double life by being a hard working student and a prostitute in her spare time. She gets her `Johns' by plying her wares on line. She meets a variety of clients including George whose entanglement with her will cause everything to change.

I have really enjoyed Ozon's previous work especially `Dans la maison', but with this there seems to be some of the warmth missing. The twists in Isabelle's character are not unbelievable but so extraordinary that as the central focus of the film it prevents all the other elements from getting much attention. So as an ensemble piece it loses a bit - unlike his previous work. The young brother is the exception and provides the best vehicle for showing that Isabelle is a complex character capable of a wide range of emotions and essentially still growing up - this is Victor played by Fantin Ravat. The ending may leave some feeling short changed too but this is far from being an average film and I did find an awful lot to like, watch out for a cameo from Charlotte Rampling too. So not Ozon's best, but still good enough to be head and shoulders above most of the competition - recommended.",1396137600,5,1746,4.470219435736677

In the French film Young & Beautiful (2013) [French: Jeune & Jolie] 17-year-old stunningly beautiful Isabelle and her very pretty friend were approached in front of their high school by an ephebophile who offered them money in exchange for sex. Isabelle refused his offer, but remembered his mobile number. She called him a week later after she learned that her classmate got a Prada bag out of the quid pro quo.

Subsequently, Isabelle had sex with a number of middle-aged men; however, when she was asked by her psychiatrist if she did it for the money she replied, ""No."" She did it, because she liked arranging the appointments, chatting online and on the phone with men. In addition, she enjoyed listening to their voices, imaging things, discovering the luxurious hotels and not knowing whom she would find. She especially liked the johns who were friendly, un-needy, and caressing. ""It was like a game,""  the nymphet said.

Interestingly, Young & Beautiful (2013) [French: Jeune & Jolie] was nominated for the highest honor, the Palme d'Or, at the Cannes Film Festival.",1395532800,2,1415,5.788461538461538
5735290,3,B00CRF4S0O,"French director Franois Ozons Jeune et Jolie (English title: Young & Beautiful) once again takes up a middle-class family as a subject matter but in a very different way, focusing a young 17-year-old daughter named Isabelle (Marine Vacth), who loses her virginity during summer vacation and then starts selling her body for money, meeting males through the internet.

In his follow-up to In the House the director never explains Isabelles motives for becoming a call girl, while challenging our accepted ideas about adolescence and coming of age in a playful and intelligent way. Ozon may employ voyeuristic images, but the watcher, as it turns out, has no sexual interest in the object. For the director, being a 17-year-old is nothing sentimental or emotional. After all, this is a Franois Ozon film.

While Ozon succeeds in creating a fascinating character in Isabelle, herself a sort of mystery to be solved, and realistically tense relationship with her mother (played by Graldine Pailhas), it seems he does not really know what to do with her when concluding the story.

Franois Ozon fans would like Jeune et Jolie for its style, but the films frustratingly half-baked final section (with Charlotte Rampling in a cameo role) lacks the impact of his better works like Under the Sand.",1394668800,2,1288,5.066037735849057

5735301,4,B00CRF4S0O,"Ever since I saw director Franois Ozon's Swimming Pool, I had wanted to see his other films to get an understanding of what the director is about in his films. This film is his most recent one and is also one with some intrigue. When it ends, the viewer still does not have most of the answers. I suppose this is what the director likes, to tell you the story and leave you with the impression if you want to know why things happen the way they do in the film, you will have to ask the characters themselves - because they are the only ones who know the answer!.

The films opening scene is voyeuristic, with the young and beautiful Isabelle, on the cusp of her 17th birthday, on holiday in a deserted beach. She surveys the beach and feels sure that no one is around, removes her bikini top and lies down in the sun. We are brought into the scene through the binoculars of her kid brother who watches her from up in the hill. Isabelles plans are to lose her virginity on this holiday which she duly executes with a German hunk. As Felix, the hunk, makes love to her on the beach, the director symbolically shows Isabelle watching herself from a distance as if to say that she wasn't enjoying it and wants it to be just over and done with.

The summer holidays over, the family is back in Paris and we are provided with our first shock as we see Isabelle, while still at school in Sorbonne, starting to moonlight as a call girl, visiting elderly men in high-end hotel rooms, charging 300 to 500 euros for a visit. But it is not as if she has turned into a full-time call girl either. We continue to see her at Sorbonne, passively listening to her teacher posing questions in the poetry of Rimbaud and her classmates discussing it. We are left wondering as to why Isabelle would resort to being a call girl because she is from a comfortable, middle-class family and is not left wanting for anything, including love and money.

Then, the director jolts us with a second shock as we see Isabelle on top of Georges, one of her older clients in his hotel room, and Georges suddenly stopping to breathe during the act. Isabelle, in panic, tries to revive the dead man, fails and then picks up the cash on the table which was due to her and leaves the hotel. Not long after, the detectives investigating the death of Georges, land up at Isabelles house and inform her mother about what her daughter had been upto. Isabelles mother and stepfather are dumbstruck and devastated and we see Isabelle admitting that she had decided to stop being a call girl. Her life in Sorbonne goes on, leaving her mother, her brother and stepfather wondering why?

The films lingering mystery is this question Why did she do it?. Director Ozon throws a few bones in our direction. Was it because of the absence of her biological father that she sought out older men to have sex with? Was she sick of being a 17-year old and wanted to be grown up ? Was she feeling bored of her middle-class existence and hence sought adventure? There are at least some answers. It wasn't for money because she hardly spent any of the money she earned this way. It wasn't that she was longing for sex because she hardly seemed to enjoy sex with any of them. It wasn't as though she sought control over men either through this route. Director Ozon simply leaves the viewers to their own devices to ponder over Isabelles action.

Young Marine Vacth is dashing and beautiful and plays her role as Isabelle in a way that makes one feel that we see a star in the making. It is a film with a couple of good twists and keeps you absorbed all the way. Worth seeing.",1445904000,,3614,4.388059701492537

5735305,5,B00CRF4S0O,"The central character of this film is no heroine. In her mind, she does see her adventures into sex for sale as heroic. At its simplest this is a film of prostitution. It presents several quandaries and steadfastly refuses to resolve any. It brings a clinical laboratory view to cinema presenting beings in clothing attempting to be civilized within set constraints one of which harlotry is forbidden. The tableau is empirical eliminating all of the stereotypical routes such as a bad home, child sexual abuse. We are voyeurs mainly and hardly participants. There is no moral path or redemption sought. As much as a viewer tries to resist its pale presentation of a teenager becoming a professional at sex, it draws them in further by pretending to give an answer to her behavior. Her family and background offer few if any clues. The anthropological sub-theme itself is the moral content. Should this be accepted adolescent behavior? A film has no moral or propagandistic authority to provide an answer. It gives a nonchalant actualization of a modern family but as the viewer you become the scientist. The film allows to mentally experiment with the parental and sibling parts and of course as it would be her scholastic lack of engagement. This could be presented as a narrative voice over with some deep voiced actor giving a video thesis; very boring and not artistic cinema. The root causes for her endeavor are not in our province in this age. So a movie exploring the symptoms leading to the one thing humans have moralized, demonized and worshipped: promiscuous intimate relationships for pay. We do get a peep of the men paying but the solid protagonist is this female teenager.  A fun film but truly disparaging especially if you see sexual exploitation as part and parcel of prostitution.",1439078400,,1800,4.921052631578948

Well made (and acted) film by Francois Ozon.  As Isabelle (Marine Vacht) demonstrated throughout the film, she (seemingly) didn't get any enjoyment from her first encounter.  Something in her just clicked, as if to say, ""If I'm going to put myself through this, I might as well get paid for it.""  It's strange how (mostly) these films involved people from well-to-do families.  Her home situation was rather normal.  Loving mom, decent step-dad and her younger brother (who she obviously was close to - despite the age gap).  Ultimately, I viewed her as an old soul who didn't know what she truly wanted - and what gap she was trying to fill with her...part type career.  Some reviewers noted that there was no real resolution on how Isabelle was going to end up.  My view:  She's Seventeen - Don't expect any...

Review - Part II (what I finally saw...)

First, let me admit that I've had several viewings of this excellent movie under my belt.  That said, it just goes to show you how much one can miss.  The hints/clues and symbolism of what Isabelle is all about are there in front of you - you really have to pay attention from the very beginning. Ultimately, for Isabelle - it's about being in control - literally - on top.  She's seeking, always seeking something that she hadn't experienced in her first intimate encounter - as she had NO CONTROL (though she was a willing participant) during the event.  From then on, Isabelle was the pleasure giver (and, even more interesting that she made a...BUSINESS out of it)!  That being said, you may require several views...to get it!

Most recommend!  Five stars!",1433030400,3,1657,4.690972222222222

This is the marvelously well written, directed, photographed and acted story of a beautiful girl named Isabelle, from a prosperous and loving middle-class family, who turns 17 during the course of the movie. She and her younger brother Victor are best friends.

She has a strong sex drive but quickly discovers that she doesn't really enjoy the act itself. Her body insists on doing it, and she's in high demand because of her extraordinary beauty, so she goes online and turns it into a part-time job on weekdays after school. She does it more to channel her frighteningly strong drive into something productive than for the money - which seems to me like a remarkably intelligent and sensible decision for a 17-year-old. No one has any idea that she's doing it, even Victor.

Everything goes well until the police investigation of a sudden but natural death involves her, and the cops tell her mother. Since she's a minor, she's legally a victim, not a criminal, but the proverbial stuff hits the fan anyway.

Besides Ozon's brilliance and skill, which are remarkably consistent across the wide range of genres he experiments with, this movie is extraordinary for three wonderful performances. First is Marine Vacth as Isabelle. It's rare and delightful when a great beauty turns out to be greatly talented as well.

Second is Fantin Ravat as her little brother Victor. Theirs is the strongest, healthiest, most interesting and most gratifying sibling relationship I've ever seen.

Third is Charlotte Rampling as the wife of one of Isabelle's clients. The scene between her and Vacth is like a cinematic jewel, full of beauty and magic. Those two powerful women and Ozon raise an already very good movie into the heavens. Fantastic.",1428796800,,2553,6.28

When veteran Charlotte Rampling appears and actually acts, the gulf between her and the teen is so evident as almost to make for unintended comedy.",1417824000,2,492,5.012195121951219

5735335,3,B00CRF4S0O,"A French film (with good English subtitles) by the director Francois Ozon (sorry I cant make the proper pronunciation marks).  This features a 16-17 year old girl named Isabelle, played by Marine Vacth.  The dust jacket quotes David Rooney (a critic) saying she gives a luminous, star-making performance.  Perhaps that translates into you get to see a lot of her young body but otherwise, these aren't the words that come to my mind.

If you are interested in seeing a film from France about young women entering the sex industry then just see Student Services.  OK true, this film does have a few unique charms compared to that one, but it lacks some depth and clarity found in the latter.  Trying to explain:  Isabelle comes from what appears to be a solidly middle-class family.  After a first sexual encounter with a young German lad who is only vacationing, she abruptly veers off the usual course of trying to find a compatible and more permanent life companion, into trading sex for money.  Whats the motivation?  The film leaves you wondering and, as far as I can see, doesnt really suggest one.

It portrays less of the downside of this kind of business than Student Services, though even the latter is pretty tame.  The most you see of a downside in this film is men who clearly treat her as an object for their gratification, and her boredom or slight distaste with those encounters.  Student Services portrays a very clear motivation for its lead character: shes struggling to get through university with insufficient financial resources, and is so hungry that at one point she faints in the middle of class.  In this film, Isabelle doesnt appear to lack anything materially, nor do we see very much of what she does or plans to do with the money she makes, apart from one or two purchases of apparel.

If theres any motivation at all perhaps its her desire for love with a father-figure.  The one client she seems to form an emotional bond with (maybe because he certainly seems to form some emotions toward her) is at least old enough to be her father, and treats her with respect and even tenderness.

As the film heads toward its conclusion, the relationship with this man reaches a conclusion and she has a quite unexpected encounter with his wife.  The film leaves you in doubt as to whether or not she will turn aside from selling sexual favors for money, or be pulled back once again to the habits she so quickly developed.
Apart from a couple of good scenes, I was fairly unimpressed with the film, though admittedly, the lead actress has a fine body to display.",1416873600,24,2583,4.664459161147903

However, I think it's well done, and it is done with a touch of kindness and thoughtfulness that another director could have easily missed. This movie is not about poor-kid-getting-out-of-miserable-life, nor it is about an abused-at-home-kid. This movie is just about a late teenager who discovers sex and by accident it becomes a way of life. She doesn't find any particular pleasure in it, she's actually divorced from the act. We (at least, I) never understand why she started doing escorts: she lives in a well balanced and apparently normal family. Yet, during the movie we discover that she finds out her mother is having an affair, but trying to reduce her ""escorting"" to an effort to match up her mother's betrayal would be in my opinion way too easy. In fact, and this is my bottom line, I think the movie challenges the audience with different possibilities to interpret or understand the kid's behavior: maybe, there is not one way to read this. And, this is what I liked about it.",1415404800,3,1062,4.745945945945946
5735340,4,B00CRF4S0O,"Life, being that it is not fair, offers each of us a unique set of circumstances. The measure of joy and pain experienced by each of us in our own lives can not be replicated or understood by anyone else. Other's may appreciate, or empathize, or even denigrate but only minimally so, for they are consumed and blinded by their own motivations as well. Is it really possible to know what another person knows?
  Isabelle would seem to be one of the lucky ones. Life, being ever so fickle, gives her opportunities that are not afforded to a great many. She has youth, beauty, potential. Her physical traits allow for options and possibilities. People want her to respond.
  Despite these advantages, she is an emotional automaton. She efforts to understand what others understand, that life is full and joyous and wonderful and tragic. She tries to sample it, gain control over it, find whatever it is that she thinks everyone else readily comprehends. What is sexual freedom? What is love? What is it to gain independence over one's own life?
  I enjoyed the narrative and her mysterious detachment, for on the surface they appear inconsistent with what everyone else would expect of her. Her innerworkings were just that - hers. She allowed strangers to possess her physically, but that was as far as she was willing to go. She never gave herself up, to anyone. Some people are just melancholy, and no matter how much they strive to escape it, they must eventually resign themselves to the truth. Life, it would seem, really isn't fair.",1415145600,3,1536,4.777358490566038

5735345,4,B00CRF4S0O,"My take on this movie is perhaps a dubiously empathetic angle; this young girl is indeed exceptionally beautiful, and has reached her sexual awakening with this reluctant awareness that most men, and boys who want to be men, would do almost anything, and pay any price to be with her.  Isabelle knows the benefits of her beauty and sexual prowress could be limitless and all she needs to do is not say 'No'. Not that she is keen to do this:  it seems all young girls blessed with this beauty have to deal with first ignoring, then resisting, what's often incessant offers by men and boys.  Frankly, I don't know how they handle it, and I'm a guy.
And many guys could watch this DVD and decide for themselves if it would be worth dying while having sex with her. Close call!
You won't see a lovelier woman in a movie, and remember this is a French woman in a French movie.  She is stunning, but I now can look at women like that and be grateful I'm not!  I'll buy the DVD and remind myself of that.  Often!  P.S. There is a bonus side story with her younger brother, and for relief, one can simply imagine having Isabelle as older sister.

5735349,4,B00CRF4S0O,"A type of restrained, sad 21st-century version of Luis Buuel's Belle de jour.  The film, directed by the rater prolific Franois Ozon (Swimming Pool), is divided into four seasonal chapters.  In the summer, 17-year-old heroine Isabelle loses her virginity while at the seaside with her family.  In the fall, she has begun a double life as a prostitute.  She studies in the morning, encounters (often much older) johns at hotels in the afternoon, and returns to her quiet domestic existence at night.  In the winter, her duplicity is revealed, and she is still contending with the numerous consequences come springtime.  The film neither glamorizes nor overtly criticizes Isabelle's actions nor is it particularly interested in diving into her fantasies and worldview.  It stays at a relative distance, inviting fresh-faced and promising star Marine Vacth to flash hints of confusion, desire, and rage beneath Isabelle's default icy detachment.  (The first sex scene is presented as out-of-body experience, with a ghostly image of Isabelle observing as her corporal self lies beneath a groaning, thrusting German lad.)  The film then is not extremely poignant, but it is riveting in its own crisp and subdued way.  It is hard to turn away from the characters and their evolving dynamics.  For instance, Isabelle's mother, after learning her daughter's secret, bemoans and marvels at the fact she is now a tad disgusted by her own child.  There are other nice touches, too, including well-placed songs by pop chanteuse Franoise Hardy throughout and, late in the film, a memorable cameo by Charlotte Rampling.",1411344000,2,1605,5.2265625
5735350,5,B00CRF4S0O,"As this film ""Young & Beautiful' began to tell its' story of the sexual (mis)adventures of a lovely young (17 year old) French maiden ""Isabelle"" it (initially) reminded me of another recent French film that explored the world of young women and prostitution: ""Student Services""(see my review of same for more on that film). In both movies the, rather disaffected, heroine of the tale dabbles in the 'play 4 pay' lifestyle to earn a little spending cash and both are seemingly emotionally quite distant from the intimate acts they are performing and the people that they are performing them with. But, whereas the plot of ""Student Services' never went much beyond the rather mono-dimensional self loathing evinced by its' lead female ""Young & Beautiful"" takes some interesting twists and turns and presents a much more complex set of characters and circumstances and is ultimately, I feel, a more engaging and successful film because of that fact.

Perhaps this is partially due to the purported 'age' of the lead character - who determines to lose her 'cherry' on her 17th BD (and does!) then sets out to market herself on the internet as an 'escort' - all this while she is still quite young and living at home with her family.  It is ultimately this interaction w/ the complexities of the various family members that gives the film its' soul and poignancy.  The Director does a fine job of revealing the various story elements and personalities slowly and providing just enough information about them to make them real without becoming moralistic or overindulgent about any of the proceedings.

The gorgeous ingenue lead actress (Marine Vacth) effectively portrays the (typically teenage) rather self-centered young woman who is coming to grips with her own physical sexuality but doesn't have much of a handle on the emotional aspects of it yet. She makes a very convincing 17 year old and rewards the viewer with many scenes sans clothing as she plies her trade - all of the sex scenes are tastefully presented - nuthin' gratuitous or XXX!  Ultimately this is a film dealing with the complex nature of human sexuality and family relationships - I found it to be refreshingly candid and non-judgmental in addressing these topics (doubtless a Euro/French touch!) and would recommend it as an intriguing viewing experience for just about anyone.

Unlike Laura, she does not do it for $$, per se.  Her parents furnish her with everything she needs.  She ends up saving up the $$ she makes:  it is unclear what she wants to spend it on (or even if she wants to spend it @ all?).

Isabelle's 1st client also becomes her favorite client:  an elderly man who is married but unhappily so.  He treats her better than any of her other clients.  It is quite a dichotomy:  a 17 year old girl with her whole life ahead of her, alongside an old fellow who does not have too many tomorrows left in the bank.  While some may find this combination repulsive, it must be made clear that Isabelle is a willing participant.

Like most French movies of this type, there is a LOT of nudity.  Marine Vacth is gorgeous and she has a supple cheerleader body.  Of course, all of this should already be apparent to people who purchase movies of this genre;  just wanting to ensure that you're aware that this is not a ""teaser"" flick.
