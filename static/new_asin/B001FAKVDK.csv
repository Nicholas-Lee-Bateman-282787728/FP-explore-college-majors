8301496,5,B001FAKVDK,Got this for the kids for christmas and they love it. I love it too because it keeps them busy for quite a while.,1358985600,,113,3.75
8301497,2,B001FAKVDK,I bought this looking for Heckle and Jeckle cartoons and there's only one of them on the entire 4-DVD set.  The King Midas and Rapunzel clay-mations on the first DVD are great.  I remember them from grade school and haven't seen them since then.,1337558400,2,245,4.545454545454546
8301498,2,B001FAKVDK,"I was excited when I first made the purchase, but was disapointed with the quality. It looked like it was videotaped from a TV screen instead of being a reproduction converted to a disc.",1335484800,,186,4.5
8301499,4,B001FAKVDK,"I have purchased two other collections of 40's & 50's cartoons @BestBuy with 150 and was dissapointed.  This collection cherry picks the best of the best.  So many surprises is this collection.  My only gripe is not about content, but the DVD itself. Each cartoon track displays track 1 so if you are playing the ninth show, it still shows track 1.  You and advance to the next show, but every track is track 1 so you can not tell if you are on the 10th track or the 43rd track. Regardless, the content is exceptional.  As I said, they did an exceptional job cherry picking the best episodes. It should be noted that there is only one Woody WoodPecker episode and one Mighty Mouse.  So do not buy it for them.  But it for these reasons:
