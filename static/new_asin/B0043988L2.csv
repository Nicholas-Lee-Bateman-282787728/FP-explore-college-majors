4253786,5,B0043988L2,"Prepare for a romantic tragedy, and a horrifying spiral into an anime that will leave you moved. AMAZING animation. Extremely under appreciated.

It's hard to find such intelligent shows as D'eon these days, even more so when you realize that this story has many real life inspirations. D'eon, our protagonist, is possessed by the soul of his sister, who was murdered. In real history, D'eon served under Louis XV, and after the Revolution  proceeded to dress as a woman until the day he died. He also underwent some secret operations under his Kings orders in the group, Le Secret du Roir, disguised as a woman who he calls Lia-who is the dead sister in this anime.

When he attempts to discover her killer, a supernatural twist is spun. Trust me, it was handled perfectly, and I am a huge history nerd, so I am more than pleased with the story. Throw in breathtaking animation, gorgeous, realistic style and beautiful backgrounds to immerse you in France, Russia, and England that the story delves into, and this is a keeper.

The dub is actually REALLY good, and I recommend you listen to that if you have a choice. The mystery is a satisfying one that will make you rack your head trying to remember all the information thrown in at the last half, but it isn't so daunting that you will become frustrated.

Like the anime I mentioned in my review title, this anime is a tragic one. Even if you don't like tragic endings, I have to persist in asking you to give this anime a try. It is severely under appreciated, and one of the most gorgeous, and horrifying and romantically tragic anime I have ever seen.

Yes, there are a lot of mixed reviews for this, but I believe that is due to the nature of this show. It is a hybrid of many things, set in a Western world, and takes a complex spin on a famous time of France. Yet, I highly enjoyed it, and like Moribito, another under appreciated anime, I was sucked in from the beginning.

Not sure still? The first couple episodes are on Youtube in English, and on Funimation's website. I highly urge you to see this amazing anime. Granted, not for everyone, but for those that can appreciate a complex, tragic story with breathtaking animation, you will have a great time!",1416355200,3,2220,4.548872180451128
4253787,4,B0043988L2,"This is a good show, all things considered. I liked the sound of the plot when I read it -I bought this before seeing it- and am fairly glad I bought it. The first episode moves at such a fast pace it seems as though the whole series will be revealed in that episode. However, it slows down drastically after that, and remains largely political in its base.

The story is based around the start of the French Revolution, therefore the revenge for Lia's death is often trumped by politics and the peace and destruction of Russia and England as well as France. It is actually quite a good show all things considered. I often become addicted to good shows, and this while not addiction worthy to me, is still a good watch and I recommend it.",1410739200,,738,4.386861313868613

4 of 5 stars

Two months ago I found this series at a pawn shop in a bin of discounted anime collections on DVD. It caught my attention, so I bought it and began watching it. I ended up watching the whole thing over a four-day period, and then re-watched it because I was so impressed and wanted to see details I had glossed over before upon first viewing. At the heart of the plot of this anime is the story of a brothers quest to avenge his sisters murder. Yet in a larger sense, it is so well written that it manages to capture much of the context of 18th century European history and culture in just 24 episodes. If you pay close attention, you will quickly be pulled into the world Le Chevalier de Deon. That is quite an accomplishment for any genre, especially anime.

That said, this is anime is not for everyone. On a most basic level I should explain that it is intended for a young adult/adult audience with regards to content. The series is mildly gory, very dark, and at times, even a little frightening for children. Additionally, there is some partial nudity, though never anything quite explicit, so it is not recommended to kids below age 14. The actual sexuality of the series is kept to an absolute minimum so as to be suitable for the rating range of TV-14, and it never becomes unsuitable. There are other reasons why some people may not like the series. Le Chavalier DEon is almost entirely Western in just about every aspect and concept except with regards to the following: 1) animation, 2) the Japanese intro theme song, 3) and the Japanese language option on the title menu. Furthermore, at least a basic level knowledge of early modern political European history is required in order to fully enjoy the rich content of the series. Its helpful to understand a little bit about some of the characters who were historical people. Why is that? Although it is true that Le Chevalier Deon is fictional and you need not understand history to follow the show in general, you must have some historical literacy in order to appreciate some of the finer subtleties and details of the series and its characters in the context of the historical events themselves.

All that said, Le Chavalier Deon stands out as a great artistic achievement in the realm of historically based anime, and I recommend it to anyone who is not deterred by the aforementioned reasons some people may not watch it. Our story begins in Paris, France in 1742. The world of medievalism and Christendom is beginning to change. No one quite knows what the changes will bring, but almost everyone of importance in the series, from the royal families to the peasants, seem to realize the Old World is crumbling under the weight of corruption and distrust. Additionally, wars such as the Spanish War of Succession and numerous other conflicts have emptied the coffers of many countries. The people are overtaxed and the prices of food are high. Only one country, England, has benefited from the recent conflicts in terms of expanding her Empire. The question is whether feudalism can or should be saved.

Against this historical backdrop is introduced our series protagonist Deon de Beaumont. Deon is a French knight of the nobility. His quest is to seek out the murderer of his sister Lia and seek revenge. Questions arise. Why was she murdered? What was the word Pslams engraved into her coffin in blood? As he begins his investigation he is aided by other noblemen, including a brave knight Telligory, a cryptic knight Durand (who may have been romantically involved with Lia,) and a youth of the French royal court named Robin, who directly serves Queen Maurie. All of these men have their own motives for helping Deon. There is something sinister happening in Versailles as well. A few people have inexplicably died, and when Deon and his comrades are attacked by a group of what appeared to be peaceful peasants, he realizes they are under a curse. The cursed have supernatural, demonic powers. When all hope is lost for Deon and his compatriots, Deon is suddenly transformed intohis sister! Somehow Lias spirit has indwelt Deon, and serves to defend him when in mortal danger with the power of Psalms quoted from Scripture. It took me a little while to get used this particular plot device, but eventually I got used to Deon transforming into Lia on a regular basis.

This is soon complicated immensely when the King of France himself, Louis XV, enlists all four in the French Secret Police. Louis explains that Lia had been working for the French Secret Police on a mission. He offers Deon and the other knights the opportunity to track Lias killer while protecting France as well. He commissions the knights to be spies for France. Their aim: to uncover a plot against the nobility and royal family formed by an illusive faction called the Revolutionary Brotherhood. This mission will take them to Russia, where Lia had served as a diplomat and ambassador to Russia until her untimely death. With relations between France and Russia being very tense, Deon must somehow convince the Queen of Russia to help him find the killer. But just getting to Russia may be a challenge. Having become spies for France, if they are caught and captured they will have no rescue. It will be as though they had never existed. They are being tracked by a fortune teller and a prostitute, who have been given supernatural powers themselves to cut down their enemies. More questions arise: What does the Revolutionary Brotherhood have to do with Lias death? What are their aims for the future of Europe, and France, specifically?

Along the way we meet the enigmatic and passionate Maximilion Robespierre, who comes to define the series in that he represents the shift from medievalism into modernity. Against the forces of the monarchy, he draws support from sympathizers of all classes, nobility, clergy, and peasantry alike in an attempt to forge a New World Order based on the secular values unleashed by the radical Enlightenment. To advance this cause certain persons must be sacrificed. For Robespierre, a person who stands against him can be viewed as an abstraction, as an idea of the Old Order which must be eliminated in order to bring about utopia where all men are kings. Thus Robespierre is the quintessential ideologue.
The crowning symbolic moment in the series occurs in episode 12 A New World when Robespierre glimpses a future France, vaguely recognizable but so much different at the same time. What he sees is a mass of millions of men and women walking away from an Old France which is engulfed in flames and making their way to the New France of enlightenment and virtue, which appears a veritable Garden of Eden. In the same scene, a priest of the Church who is also glimpsing the future sees something much different. He sees only the France aflame and in chaos. He sees the guillotines, the revolutionary soldiers gunning down citizens, slain women and children, and the wholesale burning of Western civilization by Westerners who have become barbarians. Aghast by what he sees, the priest turns to Robespierre and says Is this the future you really want? This eerie scene is a foreshadowing of the bloody and destructive French Revolution which was to occur just less than 60 years in the 1790s.

As the show builds to its climax, Deon and Robespierre come closer and closer to a showdown with one another, representing two distinct political and cultural visions of the world. This is the birth of the Right and Left in France. Deon is fiercely loyal to the King of France, bound by a concept of duty which is essential to preserving social order. Perhaps the monarchy is corrupt in many ways; however, one ought to defend King and Country for their own sake as they are worth defending because man has no other viable alternative. Robespierre is fiercely loyal to what he explicitly regards as an inevitable development of egalitarianism and the triumph of the secular New Order. He is an agent of a change which is apparently sure to come anyway and which will, supposedly, bring dignity to all men. So the battle rages for the soul of France and the soul of Western man. All round, this is a good show filled with memorable characters and chock full of great storytelling. I highly recommend it for anime fans and non-anime fans alike. Everyone will find something worthwhile in this series which tells an epoch.",1390867200,4,8440,4.768809849521204
4253792,3,B0043988L2,"I'm on the fence about this anime. There are elements that I love and then elements that I abhor.

For those whom don't know, this anime is very loosely based on real events and real people. d'Eon is based on d'Eon de Beaumont. He was a French courtier as well as a diplomat, soldier and spy. He was transgendered and Lea de Beaumont was his cover while working in Russia since at the time, the Russians would not allow male French courtiers into the country in fear that they would influence the Empress. I find it interesting that the anime turns Lea into d'Eon's older sister. Although, later in life, d'Eon did live as a woman. A wager / betting pool was placed on the newly founded London Stock Exchange as to d'Eon's true gender.

I love the artwork in this anime. France, Russia and England; along with the period garb and mannerisms are portrayed in stunning detail. The soundtrack is amazing. Most of the story is very engaging...

...However, the motivations for many of the villainous characters are never fully explained. About half way through, the story starts dragging on aimlessly and stops making sense. Plus, some of the voice acting for extraneous characters, is very overdone; especially in scenes that require yelling or shouting.

The highlights here, apart from what I already mentioned about the artwork, mannerisms and soundtrack... Are the relationships that develop between the heroes. d'Eon's older sister Lia is found murdered and he goes on a quest to try to find out the truth regarding her death no matter what the costs. d'Eon is also being possessed by the spirit of Lia. Lia seeks vengeance and she also wishes to protect the men she cared for. d'Eon and Lia's allies are Robin, Durand and Teillagory. Each of them develop a friendship with d'Eon and very interesting friendships with Lia as well. Robin and Durand both knew Lia before she died. Durand was her ""partner in crime"" so-to-speak, as he and Lia worked together as spies. It also seems that he was in love with her. Robin was the Queen of France's Page and the Queen was very close friends with Lia, so Robin had a great deal of contact with Lia. I think Teillagory really is the standout character in this anime. He is d'Eon's fencing instructor and is referred to as master quite often. He's an older gentleman, yet he possesses the enthusiasm and exuberance of a youth. He acts as the comic relief and also as the glue that sticks this group together. He's the voice of reason as well. The dialogue between all of these characters is very witty and engaging...

...Up until about half way through when everything starts falling flat. The story becomes very convoluted. It starts out like a hearty stew and becomes a runny soup, so to speak. The overall story has a lot of supernatural elements, but by the last episode those elements have completely fizzled out and the plot pulls a complete 180. It goes from mostly supernatural to mostly historical. The last episode, rather than explaining the supernatural elements... Becomes about the start of the French revolution all of the sudden. If they had the revolution weaving into the story as a sub-plot from the very beginning or had the supernatural elements tied into the start of the revolution more, that would have been awesome, yet that wasn't the case... I mean, they did a little bit by having some members of the French court openly questioning Louis XV, but those instances were very minor and you probably wouldn't really even notice if you weren't paying attention or only watched the anime once.

I would recommend watching this on Netflix (as of right now it's available for streaming and instant queue) and possibly buying the soundtrack. I got the soundtrack, it's amazing. I would not recommend buying the DVD's unless you've already watched it and wish to add it to your collection. If you like period supernatural anime, I strongly recommend that you check out Black Butler aka Kuroshitsuji. It's just as engaging as d'Eon, yet it's more entertaining and the story doesn't become convoluted. The story of Black Butler is dark and serious, but there's plenty of comic relief...something with which d'Eon could have used a lot more of.

All in all, I loved this anime. I was only displeased with how things wrapped up in the final episode.",1354838400,,4306,4.771812080536913
4253793,5,B0043988L2,"It is very rare to see a historically based anime show whether it's fiction or facts based that is not about Feudal Japan, and that's what makes Le Chevalier D'Eon so special.  Other than the distant cousin, The Rose of Versailles, Le Chevalier delves brazenly into European history of 18th century and creates a historical fantasy with supernatural twist that feels so real.  I first saw this gem on Netflix and immediately fell in love with the show.  Another masterpiece from the makers of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Le Chevalier D'Eon is absolutely amazing and engrossing.  A real treat for me to see anime masterfully intertwine history with mysticism, fiction and magic.  The writers creatively based the story on historical facts without going over the top.  I loved how they took Psalms and turned them into ""dark magic"" that only select few could master - poets; it clearly showed the tragedy and irony of how something good could be twisted into evil.  The anime has a rich and intense storyline with plenty of action, political games, intrigues, espionage, suspense, mystery, drama, constantly twisting and turning so that I couldn't sit back from the edge of the seat, never knowing what to expect, wanting to know what happens next.  The script and dialogues were complex and deep.  The series brilliantly showed the opulence of Versailles and its inhabitants, the obliviousness of the royalty and aristocracy of the time to the turbulences going on in the country leading to the decay and destruction of Monarchial France.  The clothing, royal palaces and landscapes were amazingly accurate and beautiful detailed.  The well-choreographed breathtaking and brilliantly detailed sword fights were artfully done never devolving into something unrealistic or over the top and the magic duels were just as intense and intriguing - a tribute to the limitless possibilities of anime.  The characters were complex, introspective and the suspense of not knowing their alliances, loyalties, views, convictions or intentions until the very end just added to the depth of the show.  The characters' personalities were perfectly evoked by the voiceovers and the music enhanced the mood of the scenes so that I could close my eyes and still feel like I was there.  The creators made a good usage of CGI to reproduce the vast, opulent spaces of Versailles as well as other landscapes.  The series opening and ending credits music was very beautiful, haunting and heart wrenching.  Engaging plot, beautiful art and animation, and absolutely no filler episodes!  I definitely recommend these series.  Six stars from me!",1350864000,6,2630,5.148235294117647

D'Eon is determined to uncover the mystery of his sister's murder, but his search is complicated when Lia's revenge-thirsty soul enters his body. D'Eon gathers together three companions who also wish to avenge Lia's death - Robin, the Queen's young page, Dumond, a spy who often worked with Lia, and Teillagory, the swordsman who taught both Lia and D'Eon. Together they travel over Europe following Lia's movement before her death. Loyalty and betrayal, mystery and magic, Le Chevalier D'Eon is sure to keep you guessing until the end!

I really enjoyed this show. The story and characters were both interesting, but what I enjoyed most was the artwork and the historical connection. The settings and costumes are rendered in great and beautiful detail. I visited the Palace of Versailles about a year after watching this series and I greatly enjoyed finding the parts that I recognized from the show. Unfortunately, the Hall of Mirrors looks better in anime then in real life :( The historical aspect of the series is well done and even more interesting because the character D'Eon is based on a real person - a French spy named D'Eon de Beaumont. I liked reading the historical notes on the DVDs and seeing where fact and fiction diverge.

The ending of this show was a little rushed, but it didn't bother me much. I watched this series with two of my sisters and while they enjoyed the show, they weren't nearly as impressed as I was. It depends on how much you like history and mystery :) But for $22 bucks, why not give it a try?!",1291593600,11,1696,4.6879194630872485
