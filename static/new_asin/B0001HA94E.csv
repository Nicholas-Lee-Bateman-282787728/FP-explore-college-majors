8012497,4,B0001HA94E,"Very funny movie with a well thought out ending. Showed SRK at his comical best early on and later in the movie as a person  with a conscience, reverent respect for elders and strong sense of nationalism. I didn't know what to expect when I purchased the DVD, but thankfully I was not disappointed. Kudos to Baadshah! Highly recommend this to SRK fans.",1424649600,,352,4.587301587301587
8012498,5,B0001HA94E,"Shah Rukh Khan's talent in playing comedy comes through in this movie.  He's excels in comic roles.  Baadshah is a comedy of errors and of mistaken identities.  You see him entering the casino, unshaven, looking wimpy and trying to be tough, and he is presented as ""the godfather"" who has an amazing dexterity with cards!  During his escape scenes he is suddenly all muscle, clean shaven and much taller!  A private detective mistaken for a govt secret agent by the CBI on the one hand, and as an assassin by both good and bad parties, his escapades are quite hilarious, but they soon turn deadly.  Is he able to turn the tables on the bad guys?  The songs by Abijeet and Alka Yagnik, and the dance scenes are super, especially the theme song and dance sequence.  This movie earned Shah Rukh Khan the title ""Badshah of Bollywood"".",1361404800,9,830,4.598639455782313
8012499,3,B0001HA94E,"I purchased this movie w/high expectations because I thoroughly enjoy SRK films. But this one was just alright for me. It was very silly,-not very funny-But I think of it as a SRK stepping stone to becoming a Great Actor.",1350518400,4,221,4.55
8012500,4,B0001HA94E,"We almost abandoned this movie early on. It was just too silly and over the top in the early scenes. It is about a private detective called Baahshah and his adventures. It has many nods to Hollywood detective and also James Bond type spy genres. Baahdshah starts as a rather immature though skilled hero at the beginning (why do the Indians seem to like the childish boy-men so often in Bollywood). It was becoming a bit grating so thinking we'd abandon it, we decided to skip through and listen to the song and dance sequences. Seeing the mood seemed to change we decided to go back and keep watching.
Well the silliness settled down and the plot was entertaining with the usual well-crafted twists and turns. It turned into a plot to avert the assasination of a leader with people confused about identities. One group think Baadshah is there to kill her and the other think he is there to save her as there are two with the name Baadshah. It's not a violent movie even with the shooting, and there is a love interest on the side.
We actually ended up enjoying it. A couple of the songs were catchy and the dance sequences good. If you like SRK you'll like it (and he does look so good dancing in black and silver outfit!)",1223942400,17,1223,4.44
