8467698,5,B005DWDBR4,"Don't be fooled by lack of English subtitles.  There is no spoken dialog. The song titles and credits are in Spanish, but that doesn't deter from the enjoyment. After viewing this fine production, seeing the additional track on how the film was made was mercifully brief - i.e. the usual sausage making routine. At least we got to see Carlos Saura doing the stuffing!  The dvd is for region B, but you can view it on your computer if you don't have the appropriate player. I've long since gotten one of those players whose codes have been neutralized.",1425168000,,551,4.612244897959184
