6094782,5,B00GOC74YI,"This is a decent combo set and worth picking up if you don't own the original sets and don't care about extras.

If you can find the original sony seasons one and two sets at a good price, that is the way to go.  Here's why....

1.  Picture Quality - The original season one set had 2 discs as opposed to the one in this set.  The original season 2 had 3 discs as opposed to the 2 in this set.  The compression in the original sets is less and the picture quality is a little bit better than this one.  This one seems a little bit grainier than the original sets.

2. Extras - This set has no extras.  The original season one set had a 40 minute reunion special.  The original season two had 13 short cast interviews.  They were ""easter eggs"" and hidden throughout the 3 dvds.

3. Content - The content in the new set and the old ones are the same.  The original first two seasons had no cuts and contained the original theme music.  The cuts and theme music substitution started with Sony's season 3 set.

Again, the show is a true classic and this isn't a bad little set but if you own the originals there is no reason to double dip and buy this one.  I will be doing the double-dip and buying Mill Creek's seasons 3 & 4 if they truly do contained uncut episodes and original thmes music.  I'll review those when I get them.",1397174400,14,1326,4.137254901960785
6094783,5,B00GOC74YI,Married with Children is so funny and  worth the money-Al  is always doing something that's funny and he sure is a tight wod too.,1396742400,,129,4.333333333333333
6094784,5,B00GOC74YI,"The video picture for the first episode is somewhat poor, looks washed out.  All the episodes have the original theme song which is a big thing for me.  What it lacks is close caption.  In the DVDs review that I read about this product it was indicated that there will be close caption for some of the  episodes.  I could not find any.  This is one of my favorite TV shows and I still laugh at the jokes even though I seen it several times.  Low base humor with a lot of sexual hinting something I really doubt you'll see aas well done in today's PC shows.",1396656000,8,556,4.140186915887851
6094785,5,B00GOC74YI,"I bought this DVD recently at a big box store for just $5.  Mill Creek has recently put out this new DVD set for Married with Children (they also put out a Dilbert Complete Series) and they are able to keep the prices low because there are no extras to speak of.  All the episodes are complete and present, there is just no special features to list.  But at just $5 for the first two seasons of one of the best shows ever, you can't beat that!",1393372800,,443,4.068965517241379
6094786,4,B00GOC74YI,"The first two seasons on three DVDs in this affordable set introduced us to the Bundys and the Rhoades of Chicago, Illinois. If you wanted a dysfunctional family, the Bundys were unlike anybody else on television. Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal play Al and Peggy Bundy. Al is a shoe salesman for Gary's Shoe Store for Women. Peggy is a housewife who chooses to watch television and shop rather than do household chores. They have teenage daughter, Kelly (Christina Applegate) and preteen son, Bud (David Faustino). The first episode introduced us to their newlywed neighbors, Steve and Marcy Rhoades, an idealistic, intelligent professional couple.

The DVD set has no extra features about the series and the quality is fine. Guest appearances included Deborah Harmon, King Kong Bundy, the Del Rubio Triplets, David Leisure, Geoff Pierson, Geoffrey Scott, Lewis Arquette, Diana Bellamy and more. This sitcom series would last eleven seasons. The first two seasons are funny and hilarious. If you like watching dysfunction, you can't get any better than the Bundys. They were the antithesis of sitcom families in the eighties.",1489190400,,1121,5.193370165745856

6094790,5,B00GOC74YI,"I watched this brilliant show nightly in my high school years just over 20 years ago. Without question my favorite sit com.
Al Bundy is the king but I forgot how great Peg, Marci and the supporting cast was. Looking forward to seeing Griff and No Ma'am in later seasons.",1470960000,,270,4.42

6094807,5,B00GOC74YI,"Well I like watching analog broadcast television as opposed to digital.
And that is how these look. Mill Creek Direct does not seem to do anything to clean up the old TV shows. It does not have a crisp, clear picture (same thing with the Mill Creek DVD's of Roseanne), but hey, its just a television show. I watched them this way when they were first run and I survived. Its not about the picture quality and the lack of 5.1 surround, its about the comedy and the laughter you get from watching these shows.
Some great shows from a great era in television which you don't seem to have today with all this ""reality"" television.",1436054400,3,626,4.405172413793103

6094814,3,B00GOC74YI,"well it has 3 dvd's however they are cheaply put in the box, there is no divider,they are just stacked together, it however did not have any scratches, which is good cuz i ordered them new,of course seeing as how they didn't stack them right it was a good possibility,you are not supposed to stack dvd's picture to bottom as it can scratch them. they are somewhat cheaply labeled as well, while it does give you the names of the episodes on front, an says disc one and two, it has nothing to suggest which season it is,good thing it only has 3 dvd's it should be easy, though the third disc does not even have disc one written on it, which apparently from checking is season one because it has the pilot on it",1431043200,2,709,4.2592592592592595
6094815,4,B00GOC74YI,Great Classic show that is still funny to this day.  All DVD packages came sealed and are in working order.  The only thing i thought was done cheap was that the discs are all stacked on one spool which could cause them to scratch in the future so knowing that i am very careful with them.,1431043200,,289,4.142857142857143

6094853,4,B00GOC74YI,"This is a great set for the price. However, all 3 disks are stacked on a single hub. This can produce friction between disks and cause unnecessary scuffs on them. It is also a pain to remove discs that are not on the top of the stack.",1417737600,6,234,4.0

6094855,5,B00GOC74YI,"I've seen this show bits and pieces and random episodes, always thought it was funny but never considered buying it till I saw it at 44 years old and said wtf let me check Amazon, great prices for the double seasons so I gave it a try, very pleased.  Dubbing is good and quality of video is fine.  It's funny how much Marcie changes through the shows years, from happy newly wed housewife to straight up dyke with shaved head and all.  My mom was bi sex and I got nothing against that crap just saying whats up.  The son too buzz from cute to sophisticated gentlemen with the beard and all.  Can't wait for more seasons to be released, and check under new it said $15. amazon prime and I found it new for $9. amazon prime so don't just buy first one you see check out your options.  I bought seas one and two and seasons three and four and in a few days their releasing five and six.  So I'm hoping they keep coming out with double seasons they are so much cheaper than buying single seasons. Just beware discs come in standard slim case and are spindle stacked, which can be scratch magnets if not carefully handled.",1411948800,2,1117,4.265402843601896

8625381,4,B00GOC74YI,"don't get me wrong on this the 2 seasons gets a 5 star from me however the packaging of this wonderful set gets the less then steller star, honestly would give this repackage a 0 star but that's not fair to the classic show, this set includes season 1 and 2 of this wtf show from back in the day that launched a tv station into stardom, this set is different from the older season 1 and season 2 set as its just the episodes only and none of the bonus features that the single sets have had, all in all this set is cheaply made as is what you see is what you get and do yourself a favor like I did and buy a 3 disc dvd case to separate the discs so the collection will last much longer and stay scratch free. as for the quality of the show its in the same quality as the older sets as in no remaster of the show and it looks like its being aired on a SD sub tv channel or on cable tv that claims they offer HD on there SD cable boxes, highly recommend this for any fan of 80's-90's tv remaining seasons to review soon",1495929600,,1017,3.8708133971291865
