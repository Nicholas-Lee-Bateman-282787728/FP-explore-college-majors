2396285,5,B000AXWGTA,"This series was the BEST EVER - Please - someone out there - get with it and release the entire series! My VHS tapes all got mildew a long time ago. It is not logical for someone to have only released this volume 1 set. There are so many old movies and shows being released these days, someone please do this series.",1469232000,,316,4.112903225806452

2396287,5,B000AXWGTA,"This is a favorite tv series.  I've only been able to find the first season on CD's, not sure season two made it that far [you can get on VHS tapes].  This will give a person a real eye view and experience of early days of Australia, quite similar in many ways to U.S. at same time.  The characters will win you over & it's easy to get caught up in their ""world"".  I especially like how Maggie/Kate blended their different personalities & worked as a team. Life was harsh back then, especially for women, and these two found a way to make it work in the outback without lot of conveniences. Con added just right touch of common sense & dedication needed to keep things on track. Jack could be really stubborn & get your dander up, but he was true Aussie, others were English, American, Irish, etc.  Few of the episodes lacked depth, but generally it was a great insight into Australia's lifestyle in this era & was well done.  A Disney family oriented series [20 episodes]; we were quite sad to see it end.",1464912000,,1006,4.352941176470588

2396290,5,B000AXWGTA,"What a wonderful series! We grew up watching Five Mile Creek and always watched it on VHS. I was very excited to see it was on dvd to buy for my dad. The quality of picture was great and so was the sound. The only complaint was that season 2 is not on dvd as well! :) if you want a good, clean family show set in Australia, then this is it.

2396294,5,B000AXWGTA,"My family loved watching this together when my children were small back in the 80's.  It was a weekly family event.  Now, this has made a very nice Christmas gift for our grandchildren.  Video and audio quality seem to be good and, most importantly, the excellent family and social values portrayed are welcome, refreshing, and much needed at this point in history.  One special benefit to us is our family's proximity to and familiarity with the location where the actual events happened that inspired the novel on which this TV series was based.",1455235200,,547,4.849462365591398

2396303,5,B000AXWGTA,"Refreshing to meet characters I was happy to invite into my home.  Just finished all 13 episodes (620 minutes) of Season One.  Now, where the heck are Seasons Two and Three?  I want to know what happens to these courageous characters who struggled, succeeded, failed, and pushed on with their lives!  And what's not to like about seeing more of Australia and learning of the difficulties faced in expanding civilization there.  Yes, the production was quite Disneyesque, but after the first hour, I cared more about the story and characters and forgot about the 1980's Disney production ""feel.""",1436140800,,594,5.020408163265306
2396304,4,B000AXWGTA,"This isn't your Wild West, says Australian Jack Taylor (Rod Mullinar) to American Maggie Scott (Louise Caire Clark), but it might almost beright down to the bright red Concord coach brought by Con Madigan (Jay Kerr), Jack's American partner (a Texan who describes himself as ""an old horse soldier""), on the same ship that carried Maggie and her 10-year-old daughter Hannah (Priscilla Weems) from San Francisco.  Maggie, sometime soon after the Civil War (fashionable women are still wearing bell-shaped skirts and flared, shirred sleeves), has come at the summons of her husband, Adam, who decided to try his luck in the new Australian goldfields after the ones in California began to give out; Con and Jack plan to start a mail-package-and-passenger service from Port Nelson, in New South Wales, to the mining camp at Wilga.  But Adam is nowhere to be found, and Jack suggests that instead of lingering in the town, the Scotts go out to Five Mile Creek, where the stage line plans to have a halfway station, and where most people in the rural districts pass by sooner or later.  Five Mile is an independently owned farm, the property of reliable Eddie Wallace (who turns out to be rather less than that) and his sister Kate (Liz Burch), who's left to run the place with no one to help except Paddy Malone (Michael Caton), the station's man-of-all-work.  Needing somewhere to live cheaply until Adam learns they've arrived, Maggie decides to stay and help out.  It soon becomes clear that the chief difference between New South Wales and the Wild West lies in the accents of the inhabitants, and perhaps the lack of hostile aboriginies: besides the gold, which has made Wilga a classic boom camp, there are highwaymen, or bushrangers in Australian parlance, and their chief, Backer Bowman (Tony Blackett), all of whom seem to know Paddy, although he insists he wants nothing further to do with them.  The rangers, unlike Western outlaws, don't want the coach line to succeed: rather than seeing it as a possible source of revenue through holdups, they fear it will bring civilization.  Then there's the man (Barry Lovett) with a camel and twenty ounces of flake gold, whom Paddy and Con's stocktender, Ben Jones (Gus Mercurio), don't approve of but Kate finds very attractive; Con and Jack's ongoing sparring match with Port Nelson's banker, Charley Withers (Peter Carroll); Barney Drummond (Tony Barry), the local squatter (free-range cattleman), who resolves to prevent Taylor from locating (homesteading) the 320 acres to which he's entitled, and hires gunslingers to help him; and the sometimes belligerent 12-year-old orphan boy, Sam Sawyer (Martin Lewis), who comes to live at the station after the man he's been hiding out with is swept up by a detachment of troopers trying to root out the bushrangers.  There's a travelling peddler/medicine-show man/magician, Walker the Hawker; a supposedly-French saloon chanteuse who turns out to be as Australian as Jack; the remains of a tribe of aboriginies decimated by European diseases who camp out on Kate's land and attract the family's assistance; two distinct sets of stagecoach robbers (one succeeds, the other doesn't); and a rival for the mail contract who's willing to resort to some underhanded tactics to win it.  But through it all, the oddly assorted group at Five Mile Creek gradually becomes a family; and eventually, despite early struggles, prosperity begins to build and the Australian Express acquires a good namewhich leads to a buy-out bid from the biggest line in the entire country.  Now Con and Jack, Maggie and Kate, even Sam, are faced with life-changing decisions.

This was the first of three seasons, and the only one so far to be released on DVD (given its expenseabout $12,000,000 peryou'd think Disney would be eager to bring out the rest of them and make some of its money back).  It's based loosely on Louis L'Amour's novel The Cherokee Trail, which also concerned a lone mother and daughter at an isolated stage stop, this one in southern Wyoming.  Intensive research was done into things like costumes and guns, and it shows (Con and Ben carry old-fashioned Civil-War-vintage Army Colts; the kitchen at Five Mile Creek is a separate building, connected to the main house by a covered path, and in the latter the unpainted plank walls contrast sharply with an upright piano, a dresser full of transferware, and the fat colorful cushions and knitted afghan on the open-armed sofa).",1430870400,,4465,5.017567567567568

2396322,5,B000AXWGTA,"This is a delightful series loosely based on the novel by Louis L'Amour, ""The Cherokee Trail.""  In this series, we have two ambitious young men, one American and the other Australian, trying to establish a stage coach line across the Bush in the wilds of Australia.  We also have two young women, one American and the other Australian, trying to make a go of their inn and way station that services the stage coach line.  Also included in the cast are charming characters, such as the Irishman who never loses a patient with his homeopathic remedies, a spirited orphan boy, the American girl, and the philosophical banker who is perpetually refusing to loan the entrepreneurs money only to succumb to their requests eventually.  The series is a Walt Disney series so it is very family friendly.  Although, every so often they do say the word ""D--n.""  Episode 10, ""The Awakening"" was not my favorite, however, the others are most charming.  And especially by the last two episodes, one will find oneself feeling like a part of the comraderie that is ""Five Mile Creek.""  For the ladies, the American fellow in the show, Jay Kerr,  was a Texas cowboy in real life.  :)",1410912000,,1165,4.7227722772277225

2396334,4,B000AXWGTA,This DVD did not have all of the episodes I had hoped it would have. It can be very confusing as to episodes.... I guess many have not been released on DVD by Walt Disney - but my Folks are in love with this series.. IT would be great for Disney to release all of the seasons in their entirety on DVD then follow it up with a continuation on one of their network channels...

2396354,4,B000AXWGTA,"As most of the reviewers here probably can attest, there are few TV shows available that are fit for viewing, let alone for the whole family to watch. We don't have cable, and we often buy movies and TV series we enjoy, but finding something we haven't seen before is very difficult. While browsing the shelves at the library the other day, we ran across Five Mile Creek, and the complete first season was available. I have to admit, we weren't expecting much. Disney is not renowned for making movies or shows that are interesting (in my opinion), and these days, I'm pretty skeptical when I pick up anything ""new"" (meaning new to me). But then, we popped the first disc into the DVD player and this quaint story emerges that grows on you with every episode. I was not wild about the pilot. It was decent and fairly interesting, but each episode gets better and better, and by the end of the season, we were hooked. I got on the internet to see if I could buy the second and third seasons because we so want to know what happens to the gang at Five Mile Creek, and I was extremely disappointed to find that they never released the following seasons to this charming series. So, please, on behalf of the loyal fan base of this delightful show (which seems to be a steady and growing one with new interest well after the 20 years since the finale) release the sequential two seasons on DVD so we can all travel to Five Mile Creek to visit with this unique family who have so subtly and gently captured our hearts.",1307145600,,1512,4.4035714285714285
2396355,5,B000AXWGTA,"Great show that had a continuing story arc.  I still watch every now and then on VHS because this show was never released entirely on DVD (with the exception of home grown transfers).  Too bad, this show shouldn't be lost.  The story is about a group of people, some men, some women, some Australian, some American who run a stage line and station at File Mile Creek in Australia a little after the American Civil War.  Five Mile Creek is the half way point (limbo) between the modern city of Port Nelson (heaven) and the rowdy mining town Wilga (hell) and each week various travelers stop by as well as unwelcomed bush rangers (bandits), British soldiers and those looking to set up business near the station.  As the show progresses so does the relationship of the people who live in the tiny colony showing that families don't always have to be related to each other.

2396388,5,B000AXWGTA,"I was in my early 20's when I discovered this show on the Disney Channel. Fascinated by the Australian setting, I was instantly hooked and began insisting my family and friends had to watch too. Some of my best memories are tied up in this show.

The opening episode bears the distictive style of George Miller's (of Mad Max fame) direction. But more distinctive to me was the almost instantaneous cast chemistry - each person seemed to find their 'voice' right away and that became for me the best part of the show. I loved Maggie (Louise Caire Clark) and Charlie's (Peter Carroll) relationship best of all, though I know a lot of people didn't really get them. They were an unusual pairing, but deeply romantic in their own way.

Jay Kerr (Conway Madigan) was a stud (and a real cowboy!), Rod Mullinar (Jack Taylor) was bigger than life and a huge pain in Con's side - but everyone loved him anyway. Kate (Liz Burch) was beautiful and a real go-getter who eventually claims Con's heart. Michael Caton (Paddy) was hilarious as an Irish ex-con...his riff on the Australian legend Ned Kelly was priceless. I loved his American sidekick Ben (played by Gus Mercurio). Between them all, they provided some very fun moments in a wonderful little show. Give it a chance - you'll become an addict like the rest us. :)",1131580800,,1310,4.642241379310345
2396389,5,B000AXWGTA,"This is where Nicole Kidman got an early start!

I grew up watching the videotapes of File Mile Creek. This is a unique alternative to the wild West of America. It is set in the Australian Outback during the height of the gold rush. The series is loosely based on the Louis L'Amour book, The Cherokee Trail. This is a great family mini-series and the characters are so interesting.

Kate and Maggie run Five Mile Creek, the waystation for the coach line. They are aided by Paddy, the Irish doom-and-gloom blacksmith; Ben, the horse wrangler from the States; Hannah, Maggie's preteen daughter; and Sam, an orphan taken in by Kate. Con and Jack are partners in the coachline, the Australian Express. Their fussy banker, Charles Withers, keeps the purse strings tight. (Later, we are introduced to Nicole Kidman as the sheep herder, Annie. But this is in one of the last seasons.)

The episodes included in Season One are:

Making Tracks- We are introduced to the people who will make up the crew of the Australian Express coachline and the Five Mile Creek waystation. Maggie and her daughter, Hannah, arrive in Australia in search of her wayward husband. Con Madigan arrives with the coach to meet his Australian partner, Jack Taylor. And Kate Wallace is abandoned and left to run the waystation all by herself.

Horses for Courses- Learning to live in a wilderness & getting the coachline off and running.

Love Before a Fall- Life is complicated by stolen gold and a mysterious drifter, for whom Kate falls in love with.

A Few Surprises- Jack contracts a deadly fever that can only be cured by a native potion.

The Scrub Bulls- Jack & Con look to expand the business but have to deal with a stubborn squatter. Maggie's school is off and running as she learns a terrible secret about her husband.

Bang the Big Drum- A naive peddler comes through the area and the ladies go shopping.

Gold Fever- Gold fever sweeps through the Five Mile Creek area bringing prospectors and the worst lawbreakers, ""bushrangers.""

Annie- A pregnant woman goes into labor at Five Mile Creek, complicating Maggie's life as she deals with her husband's sudden re-appearance.

Home and Away- Maggie has to decide whether to stay in Australia or return home.

The Awakening- Jack's first shipment of gold is stolen and Kate takes care of a very sick Aborigine family.

The Prize- Jack and Con step into the boxing ring to secure a contract for the Australian Express.

Tricks of the Trade- Bushrangers threaten a shipment of currency. Sam's foster parents arrive to take him. Kate is told she must be married in order to adopt him and a proposal comes from the unlikeliest of sources.

Thanksgiving- The American holiday looms as Maggie gets word of a tragedy and a feud erupts between the partners.",1125532800,,2776,4.7761506276150625
