This excellent introduction to Montessori A to I practices in the USA and Japan will now be shown during the lecture series, along with the NAMTA DVDs ""Edison's Day"",and ""In a Montessori Home"", in addition to the Robertson's ""A Two Year Old Goes to the Hospital"" and the excellent documentary ""Babies"". Thank you, Susan Mayclin Stephenson for this enchanting glimpse into what the youngest children can do with the support of prepared adults and a prepared environment!",1397865600,3,742,5.040650406504065
