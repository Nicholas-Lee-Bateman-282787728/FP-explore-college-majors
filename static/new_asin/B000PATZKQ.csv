2814924,5,B000PATZKQ,"I do not think that Mr. Olson comes down firmly on one side or the other in this film, even though he identifies himself as an Evolutionist. This is not the point of this film. He most definitely is not bashing anyone. Instead, it shows the difficulty that comes about when two sides have such a hard time even discussing such a topic. If anything, he takes the Pro-Evolutionists to task for not being able to clearly articulate their points of view to common folk.

I'm sure many of us have had good or bad experiences in discussing certain topics with family and friends. If we have a wide-enough group of contacts there must inevitably be the individual or group that you simply cannot continue the discussion with because you cannot understand how they could possibly think the way they do. This film shows why it is so difficult for Evolutionists to engage in a debate when they mostly feel there is no reason for a debate. And it is told with a great deal of sensitivity, respect and humor toward both sides -- especially endearing when he presents his own mother's points of view (the last scene of which left me chuckling for hours).

I am sorry, but I cannot compare Randy Olson to Michael Moore because I do not see where Mr. Moore shows any respect toward anyone who disagrees with him. Where Mr. Olson presents an engaging experience, Mr. Moore simply comes across as a smartass.

Upon watching this film, you may be surprised at how serious the divide on Intelligent Design and Evolutionism really is. Other than sound bites on TV, you may not even be aware that there is a group with $5 Million in funding geared toward promoting their point of view. Truly a fine bit of film-making!",1187395200,20,1697,4.5756578947368425
2814925,4,B000PATZKQ,"Wow!  I liked *Flock of Dodos*.  You have to have an open mind to view this documentary on evolution and intelligent design.  It is both educational and interesting.  This film touches aspects of the debate that you may not have seen in the media.

What is the difference between evolution and intelligent design?  What is the difference between intelligent design and creationism?  If you don't know or not sure, then this is the one you need to watch.

It's interesting to see how much and how long these people have been fighting for what is to be taught in the schools, especially the Kansas Board of Education.  It is amazing to see what people believe about the origin of life.

One camp believes in ""teaching the science"".  The other camp believes in ""teaching the controversy"".  So, one believes that presenting natural evidences (fossils, etc.) is the way to go in schools.  The other believes that one should lay out pros and cons of each theories/approaches.  The bigger question that this film presents is what exactly is intelligent design?  And how is this really different from evolution or even from creationism?

This film touches on the state boards of education in a few cities, the Discovery Institute, scientists/evolutionists and their views, Christians, and other whatnots.  For a film that is 1 and a half hour long, it is packed with information.  You just have to watch it.

Now, Olson did a good job on the subject of intelligent design.  There's just some parts of it that could have been edited out.  I think that Olson tries to be like Michael Moore.  The difference is that Moore has more balls to confront people.  Olson tries to confront people but he ends up liking his interviewees even if he disagrees with him.  Nothing wrong with that.",1182729600,20,1773,4.775577557755776
2814926,4,B000PATZKQ,"This is a very insightful condemnation of Intelligent Design and the approach of evolutionists, with minimal humor, but a lot of fun.  Olson takes a relaxed approach to this huge controversy, and teaches us a great deal in the process.

He tells the story with some of the style of Michael Moore, using dry wit, multiple interviews, and an overt agenda. He was an evolutionary marine biologist, a student of the great Stephen Jay Gould, who decided to go into film, and here looks at all angles of the intelligent design controversy and how it tries to attack evolution. The movie is short on content and long on entertainment, and that's for a purpose. The goal of the movie is to show how behind biologists are in public relations, and how much more they need to do.

The movie did this admirably. The evolutionists come across as either Ivory Tower scientists who can't relate to the public, or real prigs who you wouldn't want to drink with. The Intelligent Design folks are all pretty likable, but simultaneously really off when it comes to science, for the most part not knowing anything behind what they are saying. Olson wishes to point out this huge gulf between the facts and likability, and call scientists to a place where they can start to actually reach out to the public on a level that doesn't require four years of grad school to understand. The scientists are therefore the dodos in the film.

This movie's raised a lot of controversy because the Discovery Institute, based in Seattle and the leader of the ID movement, complained that they weren't consulted and that the movie is very biased against them, for instance making it look like their budget is 5 million instead of 4 million. Likewise the scientific community complained that the movie makes them look bad and that Olson is calling for them to dumb down their material.  Yet Olson tried to use material indicative of the personalities, even excluding the comment that Behe made that he didn't care what was taught in public schools because his children don't attend them.  This comment wasn't reflective of all of the rest of Behe's interview, and so therefore was excluded from the film.  (It can be viewed, however, as an extra on this DVD.)

There are moments to smile at here, rather than laugh out loud.  Some of the focus on the director's mom, Moose, was perhaps a bit irrelevant.  But the film overall is a brilliant work, simultaneously condemning both sides, and calling for radical change in the way that science is presented- but in a light-hearted manner that few can effectively achieve on film.",1178841600,49,2589,4.758928571428571
2814935,5,B000PATZKQ,"Flock of Dodos is a simple movie.  That is its genius.  Flock of Dodos is about ""Science"" versus ""Other.""  I MUST warn you, that I am an agnostic.  I neither believe or disbelieve in anything regarding deities.  Deities, by definition, have supernatural powers that render them immeasurable, and, therefore incalculable.  Deities are, therefore, a matter of ""FAITH,"" which I choose not to have.  I don't BELIEVE, but neither do I choose to DISBELIEVE.  The only thing of which I am sure is that I will never have any way to measure the performance of GOD.  Because GOD is a supernatural being, with extra-terrestrial powers.

What I DO know is that I don't have any way to empirically evaluate that claim.  I fancy myself as a scientist.  And, as such, I demand extraordinary evidence if some claim is to be believed.  You cannot imagine how much I'd like to find my parents, my older sister, and all the people I loved when I was young, if I ever ended up in heaven.  But, at what point, in my life, and their lives, would I find them?

This doesn't even start to figure out all the dogs I loved.  Some people insist that ""lesser"" animals won't be there.  Well, why the HELL not?  This is a MONUMENTALLY GREAT Movie, if you have an open mind.  Tea Party need not apply.

2814936,1,B000PATZKQ,"This so-called documentary wasn't even worth what I paid for it brand new, just one cent. I am also glad that I waited six years to watch it since the documentary is very insulting to watch from a Creationist standpoint, and even from an Intelligent Design one for that matter since the insults keep on coming for 90 minutes. Additionally, one does not even get a clear understanding of what the theory of Intelligent Design actually believes, despite Michael Behe's assertions to the contrary. As other reviews have noted, evolutionary theory is presented from an academic viewpoint while contrary views are portrayed by ""good old plain folk"" who the movie makes out to be pure idiots and over and over again. The writer and his colleagues in the movie also come across as elitist, which is to be expected as humanistic philosophy promotes this attitude. Watched this movie twice and the extras and in the end, this DVD is not worth the penny that I paid for it and quickly went in the trash.",1383868800,,993,4.712643678160919
2814937,5,B000PATZKQ,"This is a terrific documentary about the confabulated ""controversy"" regarding the teaching of evolution in America's public schools. Randy Olson gets lucid and often humorous commentaries from various evolutionary biologists to explain not only evolution, but why the bizarre notions of the ""old and young-earth creationists"" and the ""Intelligent Design Network"" jihadists are not based in any way upon rational constructs.

He also interviews some of the loopier members of the Kansas Flat Earth Society such as state Board of Education members Connie Morris,  a substitute teacher who was defeated for reelection after it was revealed that she had charged the state thousands of dollars for her lavish family vacations, and Kathy Martin, a former teacher who recounts that she found books useful in the classroom because by standing on stacks of them she was able to access shelves that would be otherwise out of her reach.  Jack Cashill, the radical right wing creator of innumerable delusional conspiracy theories about Bill and Hillary Clinton also makes an appearance.

The most charming member of the entire cast of characters, though, is none other than Olson's own mom, whose common sense and plain talk are a counterpoint to the theocratic proclamations by members of what was then the immensely embarrassing and thankfully outgoing board majority that would have scrapped world history and sex education as well as evolution from the Kansas K-12 curriculum.",1372204800,,1468,5.341991341991342
2814938,1,B000PATZKQ,"The first clue that this isn't a legitimate documentary is that it insults a group of people in its title. This should have turned me off from the start, but I've been running through every documentary Netflix suggests, and this was one of them.

From the 4 minute mark when the twangy banjo starts up, there's even less reliance on real discourse, and more reliance on name calling and insulting.  The people interviewed seem more like stooges hired to make a straw man argument than any kind of legitimate endorsers of Intelligent Design.

The biggest problem here is that this kind of trickery, the music, the yokels with their incoherent arguments, the condescending tone of the narrator, aren't needed.  There are plenty of ways to expose the ridiculousness of the 'theory,' and explain why it's wrong, with a respectful attitude and at least some semblance of inquiry.

I try not to be a critic, but these kinds of 'arguments' are bad for science.  By relying on fallacious rhetorical styles, 'documentaries' like this give the ID crowd a way to dismiss the scientific community as being obnoxious and rude instead of eloquent and convincing.",1368921600,3,1148,4.922279792746114

2814940,1,B000PATZKQ,"So, I don't consider myself a believer of intelligent design (ID) or creationism and I at least consider myself in a believer in micro-evolution.  I am currently trying to learn more about evolution (which I was taught in school) and the theory of intelligent design (which I have heard of before).  I used to completely accept macro evolution as well, but lately have been questioning it.  I watched Expelled and wanted to watch the other side of the argument so I watched Flock of Dodos.  I believe in always hearing both sides of an argument.
Kudos to the documentary for giving credit to the intelligence design theory for asking a ""good question"" about the complexity of a simple life form of bacteria.  Although they didn't go into the same detail as Expelled on just how complex the protein strand had to be for a single called bacteria (I think it was 250 correct protein combinations in that order).  The scientist on Dodos said that evolution COULD explain these things but that scientists were doing a bad job explaining it.  There is over an hour left of the film, but they never do explain it.  I was really disappointed.  I was hoping the documentary would address some of the so-called ""challenges"" that ID presents.  Instead, all it did was give it more credibility by bringing it up and called it ""a really good question"" and then leaving it alone and never answering it.  That was my biggest disappointment , but I have two others worth mentioning as well I think.
The documentary mentions a book called ""Icons of Evolution"" by Jonathan Wells.  I have NEVER read it and therefore will limit my comments to what they mention in the documentary.  The narrator argues that by pointing out that ""if even one"" of the eleven points the author makes in his book is wrong, then ""we have to wonder about his whole book.""  Although that is a limited argument in and of itself, I understand that one could probably devote a whole program on the eleven points and the documentary doesn't have time for all of them BUT the example he uses is Haeckel's embryos which the documentarian chooses because of his own background in embryology.  The problem is that he agrees with the book's assertion that Haeckel committed ""scientific fraud"" by drawing pictures of embryos from different animals to look incredibly similar when in actuality those different animals' embryos look quite diverse but he argues that those pictures are not used any more in today's textbooks and as it was ancient history, it is a moot point.  I have two problems with this.  The first is that the drawings were made in 1874 and Darwin's book was first published in 1859; its sixth edition followed in 1872.  These pictures were used as ""evidence"" during a time period when evolution WAS still a hot debate.  The ""scientific fraud"" is relevant BECAUSE it is so old, not the other way around!  What's more, the documentary could only find the drawings in a textbook published in 1914 thereby supposedly proving that Haeckel's drawings are not being taught or used in more modern times.  I'm not sure why the two or three books happened to not have Haekel's drawings in the room where he conducted this interview, but I had a textbook WAY back in ye olde days of the 1990's--not that old--that used Haeckel's drawings.  It was absolutely used in my high school as evidence of evolution and I so clearly remember it because it left such an impression on me on how similar they all were and with how little difficulty embryos would need to change to evolve to another new creature.  Later on, in college, I AGAIN heard about Haeckel's drawings and in this case, they were used to justify early abortions because you were killing something that was so similar to a frog or pig or cow at that age in life development then the moral implications were the same.  Hey, don't we all participate in the killing of cows when we enjoy a nice juicy hamburger?  So, this point in the documentary was really unconvincing to me.
Finally, the PhD's experts that got together to play poker were a very unconvincing crowd to me.  One of them claimed that he was only able to procure grants so long as he promised not to discuss evolution.  They even threw out a name:  Rick Santorum (a republican senator from Pennsylvania) but they never backed this up with evidence.  Compare this name throwing with Expelled were that documentary was littered highlighted texts, letters and emails with multiple names of people fired for their openness to ID and the contrast is quite great.  I open to listening to a point like that, but you have to back it up.
On the same note, one of the points Expelled makes is that the ID people were not just ""punished"" for their beliefs in ID or openness as the case may be, but their political and religious affiliations were examined.  This argument from Expelled is made more believable by watching Dodos.  The documentary brings up politics A LOT.  Even the map of the United States is colored in red and blue based (I am guessing as they do not specifically say) on how the states voted in the last election before release:  Bush's second election.  It sure would be. A different looking map after President Obama's second election, but that map would not serve to make the pro-evolution's point that this is a political and/or religious disagreement, rather than a scientific one.  And if you think the PhD's leave out religion and just stick to scientific arguments still, allow me to leave you with this quote from their poker get together that was obviously not cut from the final edit for this documentary:  ""Religious fanaticism is a really dangerous thing.  We see it through history over and over again and I think this could actually cultivate that.""  He is talking about teaching intelligent design in schools, not terrorists attacks or Natzism.
Speaking of Natizism, again Expelled made such a stronger point of the association of Hitler with Darwin's theories and this was also NEVER addressed in Dodos which, as I pointed out already, had no problems attacking conservative views as being the origins of some type of dangerous religious fanaticism.  Need I point out that there a many religious conservatives who DO believe in micro and macro evolution?  I should know; I used to be one and certainly all of my friends that are religious conservatives are.  I am the only person I know in my circle of friends questioning macro evolution.
I finished watching it feeling disappointed and even a bit insulted.  I hope I can find a better pro-evolution video than this one!",1358640000,5,6573,4.733977172958736
2814941,3,B000PATZKQ,"The description makes it sound more balanced but it's very biased toward evolution. It's overall good documentary except you get the feeling that they are laughing at the I.D. people behind their backs. I didn't really learn anything from the movie which was disappointing. See Expelled for the other side of the story&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Expelled-No-Intelligence-Allowed/dp/B001BYLFFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed</a>

Now My Opinion... And I won't be back to debate it.

The truth is Darwin had a theory that helped brake from the biblical creation story and freed peoples thinking a little. But it does have holes and it's not proven conclusively that Modern Man is a product of evolution alone. Where is the missing link? What are the odds of what we have to day being random? How come we are so far ahead in Evolution over other animals that have been around longer than us?

Darwinism is the Religion of Atheists and just like the Christians they don't want their faith shaken.

Science as process is a good thing, but the Scientific establishment of today is not much better than the church of the middle ages except that they don't burn you at the stake. If you are part of the scientific community you risk being ostracized, laughed at and ridiculed, losing grants and funding for thinking differently, believing in God, Aliens, Paranormal. You have to accepted the accepted truth even if it not the truth. And you can see this in science and medicine all of the time.

They kept saying in the movie we want to only give natural explanations in science, well sorry that's not going to cut it anymore, because we are not the product of only nature and reality is also heavily controlled by consciousness.

And believing in intelligent design does not mean you are a bible thumper. It means you just don't accept Darwin's incomplete theory that we and the modern world are from random events.

I have always believed that God (The Quantum Field, The Cosmos, etc) created Evolution just as it did the Big Bang (Science still has no proof or answer what what caused the Big Bang) and recently I have come to believe that we as humans have had genetic upgrades from primitive man to our current state from more advanced beings. Which is clearly spelled out in many ancient texts, hieroglyphs etc, from many parts of the world. But of course the arrogant scientific establishment (who still can not create the mega structures of ancient man, and reverse most theories every 10 - 20 years or so except for the Stagnating Darwin Theory) that's just a fairy tale.

Science is now (improperly) used as a tool to control the smarter sheeple just as religion is used to control the dumber sheeple. By those doing the funding and those seeking to maintain the status quo. Much like Thomas Edison did all he could to discredit Alternating Current by Tesla and Westinghouse which we use today.

Both Religion and Science seek to tell you what to believe. Science appeals to logic, ego and fear of being seen as dumb or gullible. Religion works by fear of damnation and judgement. Both are used to tell people how to think, what to think, and limit their thinking and take their power away from them.

The correct answer is to teach the controversy... and I really don't see how people can be offended by thinking sure there is evolution but it has intelligence behind it. Quantum Physics is now seeing Consciousness as part of the equation of the external world but not evolution as well.",1349740800,2,3569,4.913621262458472
2814942,1,B000PATZKQ,"I feel lost.  The video lacks structure and is uninformative.  The director seems to think everyone has been keeping up with any scientific point by point discussion that is for and against Intelligent Design, for example ""what holes do Intelligent Design supporters keep pointing to?""  I think there are holes in Evolution.  After all, until Evolutionists can quantify how much genetic mutation has to occur for a creature to become a separate species, aren't we back to pointing to miracles and assumptions like Intelligent Design supporters.  Also, if we're so closely related to apes, why can't we procreate with them and return to being apes and vice versa?  To me, this is so crucial to evolution that fossils and look-a-likes and survivors with mutations should come second.

The video can be stated into one phrase ""Intelligent Design is baseless and its key supporters have religion as their main drive.""  Well, obviously... Everyone has to eat and survive and adapt to their environment, even people.  Isn't that the whole point of Darwinism.  If being religious could help you survive, then there would be people who would do it for that sole purpose.

2814943,4,B000PATZKQ,"A fun but rather disorganized look at the ""Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus"" as far as it had gotten in 2006. One problem with documentaries, of course, is that by the time they get to DVD, they are already somewhat out of date. But it's useful nonetheless.

Filmmaker Randy Olson was an evolutionary biologist before he got the camera virus. His mother is included in the film, and she's a real prize, helping to explain a lot about Randy's own personality. His mom was a model before she married Randy's dad. And she's still quite a freethinker and fun lady. I especially love her ending to the film.

Randy interviews both sides of the debate, tracks down historical elements, and has a clear understanding of how visual effects can assist in a project like this. For example, a brick wall with a few gaps illustrates ""God of the gaps"" arguments by gradually filling in the bricks, giving the cross which represents religion less and less room, and finally blocking it out altogether. The scientist who is posed before a particularly magnificent large fossil explains that the problem is this either leads to a phobia about science (fear that the gaps will be filled in) or a crisis of faith. Students shouldn't have to face that from a public school curriculum.

He also spent a good bit of time with the Kansas School Board members and the Dover, PA, school board members. And former members. Also with lawyers who worked on these landmark cases, scientists and pseudo-scientists who testified in them, authors of books on both sides of the issue, and so on.

It may not be well organized, but it's really quite a lot of information and even more fun.

2814952,1,B000PATZKQ,"If you want a good documentary that actually addresses both sides of the debate, states the strengths and weaknesses of both arguments and tries to offer an honest conclusion about which is the stronger argument, do not waste a penny on this movie.  You will not learn anything.  Intelligent Design is misrepresented and smeared, and a detailed case for Darwinism that destroys the ID argument is never even attempted - the filmmaker basically falls into the same lazy trap of calling Intelligent Design theory creationism so that he never has to attempt to refute the Intelligent Design argument.  If the filmmaker wanted to make a dodo out of Intelligent Design all he had to do was immediately show, using illustrations and evidence, exactly why the Intelligent Design argument is wrong, why Irreducible Complexity is wrong, and end the debate right there.  If you read Michael Behe's debates with major scientists here on amazon by looking up his book ""The Edge of Evolution,"" and finding the blog debate, you'll see him repeatedly expose the false arguments thrown at him by the supposed top scientists of the day.  It's right there for all to read.  This is probably why the filmmaker of this documentary avoids the actual debate and sticks to name calling and belittling.

Since there is no honest and proven refutation of Intelligent Design (research it thoroughly, there actually isn't), the filmmaker is left with 2 options - to either present the debate honestly and admit weakness in Darwinism, or hide from the debate and simply condescend, ridicule, and look down upon the ""ridiculous"" ID movement.  The director chooses the 2nd option.  They forgot to be scientists.  What we're offered here are a bunch of lazy ""scientists"" smoking cigars, playing cards and belittling others, all the while forgetting to bring their actual argument to the table.  They try to dismiss ID by destroying old creationist arguments.  What does one have to do with the other?  ID theory and creationism are two completely different things.

The Darwinists in this film don't make a dodo out of Intelligent Design because, as Pacino said in And Justice For All-

""Only we have a problem here. And you know what it is? Both sides want to win. We want to win! We want to win regardless of the Truth! And we want to win regardless of Justice!  WINNING is everything!

Needless to say, the movie made an impression on all of us. To this day I still say this is a movie that every ecologist and evolutionists needs to see to avoid the pitfalls of stubborness and just plain 'smartness'.

But at the same time, it is not a movie made for scientists only. The movie is made in such a simple and straightforward way that anyone can (and should) watch it as well, and the various GRE words definitions throughout the movie make for a very fun diversion for anyone who has had (or is) studying for that exam. There's a good deal of humor and contrary to popular belief, it is not made to insult or demean as most other movies of this genre would.

Silly as it sounds, this movie is very much worth it and I highly recommend. This now stands proudly in my dvd collection and I keep making friends watch it. So far, no one hated it.",1222473600,5,1026,4.2030456852791875
2814954,4,B000PATZKQ,"A marine biologist turned filmmaker goes to middle America to explore the issue of Intelligent Design and discovers, to no one's great surprise, a political and social agenda behind a manufactured controversy.  Along the way director Dr  Randy Olson has reasoned, calm and mostly rational discussions with people from both sides of the issue, allowing each to explain their ideas, but also to reveal their vulnerabilities.  The Intelligent Designers for the most part know less about science and more about theology, while the scientists seem a bit smug and unable to communicate with anyone without a graduate degree in science.

Overall, this is an intelligently produced and entertaining presentation of the topic.  Three points, though, I wish had been addressed.  First, if irreducible complexity demands a creator, then Dr Olson should have been asking, who created the creator?  Secondly, why does this science/religion controversy pop up from time to time only in the USA?  The rest of the world seems to care not a whit.  Finally, why is this question of the origin of life and the universe of any importance at all?  It seems obvious that understanding the question means being able to observe and measure the system from outside the system.  But as we are (and always will be) a part of the system, this is the equivalent of your eye trying to see itself.  It won't happen.

2814958,2,B000PATZKQ,"I question the professionalism of the production of the film Flock of Dodos. I felt that the presentation was extremely biased, which took away from the educational values of the movie. One of my favorite documentaries is Supersize Me; and, while it's clear that Morgan Spurlock had preconceived notions from the onset of the film, I believe that he portrayed the information in a fair and, relatively, unbiased manner. I do not see this to be the case with Flock of Dodos. I think the film cheaply employed Daily Show type tactics, (i.e. - clipping a full length interview into a 15 second snippet of the interviewee having a tongue-tied moment) in order to make the interviewed person look ignorant (don't get me wrong, I love Jon Stewart & Colbert, but even Stewart mocks people who use his show as a source for factual information).

In Freshman College English we learn that when writing a paper, one should strive to establish credibility so that the reader(s) will trust that the author isn't trying to deceive the audience; and, in turn, the reader(s) will be more receptive to claims made that require a leap-of-faith. I believe the same should be true for this style of film. In my eyes this film did not portray such a level of credibility. Therefore, when the narrator made the claim that he tried to speak to the offices of the organization that funded the ""Intelligent Design"" movement (without the presentation of a single recorded phone conversation or any phone records), I wasn't inclined to believe him.

On his chart comparing the points of Darwinian Evolution and Intelligent Design, I felt that making the Intelligent Design points have a crooked alignment further took away from his credibility. I also think that playing banjo & harmonica music whenever mentioning Republicans could be construed as being offensive to Southerners and/or Republicans (I'm from New York myself; but, I could see a southerner being rightfully offended). Even more importantly, based on years of study in the fields of Biology and Chemistry at my university, I think that the Director's esteemed drunk colleagues were wrong in asserting that Darwinian Evolution should be reclassified, since it's no longer a ""scientific theory."" From my understanding of the field of Biology, and Science as a whole, I believe that a Scientific Theory is a formalized compilation of a group of observations forming a tentative principle in science; in this case, Darwinian Evolution would be a perfect example of a Scientific Theory.

The film did turnout to be pretty funny though...

Synopsis:
Flock of Dodos is an independent film about the Intelligent Design Controversy. Intelligent Design proposes that the micro & macroscopic organisms today are too complex to have been created (solely) through a series of generational Natural Selection. They don't refute Evolution entirely, but mix in their own beliefs (primarily the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation viewpoint). Some of them believe that the Earth is older than 6,000 years, but they say that a natural mountain range is as much a testament of a methodical creation as the sculpted Mount Rushmore. The director focuses on Kansas's fight with Intelligent Design being taught in public schools. Suffice it to say it didn't quite work out. Then he goes on about a Conservative funded ""Scientific"" Institute, which in turn funds the promotion of Intelligent Design. Then he closes the movie talking about how Muffy Moose was a model, and she later thought she was a witch, and finally became a Buddhist.",1210550400,6,3548,5.070205479452055
2814959,5,B000PATZKQ,"Former marine biologist Randy Olson has crafted a brilliant and very down-home style documetary that exposes the soft underbelly of the  ID ""controversy"" which, as it turns out, is little more than the proverbial tempest-in-a-teapot.  There are, however, a number of disturbing issues raised by easy going, good ol' boy Dr. Olson.  First, the duplicitous shenanigans of the ID crowd as personified by Professor of Communications John Angus Campbell who speaks on behalf of Darwin but is a long time board member of Discovery Institute (and who also gave the interviewer that wierd pinkie/index finger ""hook 'em horns"" hand gesture which makes me wonder about his allegiances altogether).  Then there is the well known Dr. Michael Behe whose scholarship in science serves a religious doctrine that is oddly reminiscent of Inquistion priests who extracted confessions from those who saw the gaps in the god.  Today Behe and others exploit the nonsensical ""god in the gaps.""  Just a through the looking glass reflection of the same wrong-headed adherence to dogmatic belief.

Second, and even more problematic, is the quotation by Justice Scalia from his dissenting Minority Report on the Edwards v The State of Lousiania case(1987).  ""The people of Lousiana...are quite entitled...to have whatever evidence there may be against evolution presented in their schools...""  One must wonder if this same principle applies to every  theory.  Ought every scientific theory presented in a public school science class include ""whatever evidence"" there may be ""against"" the prevailing scientific paradigm? This would certainly open the doors to whatever ""evidence"" diverges from science such as UFOs, Bigfoot, and a host of paranormal phenomenon.  One can only imagine the intolerable bind that such a principle of inclusion would put science educators in.

Dr. Olson's non confrontational interview style allows believers to be hoisted by their own petards.  But he doesn't spare scientists either.  Their rarified discourses can't compete with the ID PR machine that reduces science to sound-bites and false analogies crafted to snare the unwary. Frutstrated though they may be, mainstream academic scientists take a hands off approach to ID as being hopelessly irrelevant and simply cannot reduce the complexities of science to layman's terms.  As a consequence bumperstickers proclaiming ""teach the controversy"" hold more sway than the writings of the late Stephen J. Gould.

Dr. Olson has done a great service in documenting the history and current state of affairs of religiously inspired attempts to put god back in the schools and return us to the Dark Ages.  It was certainly not a good sign that Christian fundamentalists appear to sound much like Muslim fundmentalists in their rejection of secular science.

2814960,5,B000PATZKQ,"""We have woefully under-educated the American public in the area of science. It is going to take a long time to overcome that.""

  - Kansas School Board member as  quoted in ""Flock of Dodos""

I am not sure if it is possible to write a ""spoiler"" to a documentary film. But if it is, I warn you that I am about to do it, as the conclusion of Flock of Dodos is quite necessary to reviewing this film. If you don't want me to spoil it for you, don't read on.

The film ""Flock of Dodo's"" is one scientist's (now film-maker's) journey to explore what the big deal is behind the intelligent design/evolution controversey. The conclusion? It is a controversey not of sceintists versus sceintists, but scientists versus lawyers and advertisers. The director tells us that his purpose was to find out more about the controversey in order to see if there was anything to it, but the more he found out, the more problems he had.

This is a very cool film that takes something of the form of a road-trip primarily into, and back out of, Kansas (where one of the more famous challenges to evolution in school curricula took place). We meet quite a few faces from all sides. On the evolution side, we meet several scientists from various universities and two former school board members. On the ID side, we meet Michael Behe (one of ID's 'pioneers'), John Calvert (lawyer making his living defending ID), and even attempt, unsuccessfully, to meet some folk from the Discovery Institute.

Through all of this, however, the film's director notices a big problem. Even though evolution is quite universally accepted and regarded as well corroborated fact in the scientific community, scientists and academics are very bad at being spokespersons for evolution in the way people like John Calvery and Michael Behe are spokespersons for ID. At one point, the director even wonders to himself, after noting Behe's status as one of the 'faces' of ID, who Behe's equivalent is in the evolution world: who are the public spokespersons? The answer, he finds, is that there aren't really any. (He does not mention people like Richard Dawkins, but if he did, it would be sad, as Dawkins has more-and-more become a perfect target for accusations of evolutionary zeolotry and irreligion).

Another great thing about this film is that we meet a wide variety of people and begin to see all of them as quite human - none of these people are evil, though many of them are convinced that the other side is. (And if both sides are nice folk convinced that the other side is evil, then the question comes up: do they really know eachother at all, or do they just scream in eachother's direction?)

My personal favorite by way of highlights was the director's confrontation of John Calvert, who asserts that Haeckel's drawings are a fraud widely used in evolution textbooks. Were Haeckel's drawings a fraid? Yes, and you don't have to get this info from - as Calvert did - Jonathan Wells' inflamatory book ""Icons of Evolution."" Are these drawings widely reproduced in textbooks? The answer is no, and the confrontation leading us to this conclusion is absolutely hilarious. I won't spoil it; you have to see it for yourself!

This is a good film. At times, it seems almost Michael Moore-ish but, unlike Moore's films, there really isn't a whole lot of UNSUBSTANTIATED spin here. You don't get the impression, as one does with Moore's films, that he is ambushing people, or that he is using rhetorical trickery (like taking quotes out of context, or grandstanding.) Behe has as much, if not more, say than many of the scientists in the film.

If you are concerned about evolution, intelligent design, and the fuure of sceince education, this is an outsanding film to watch. The director shows us why the issue is as contentious as it is important, and why - more importantly - evolutionists may be winning in the halls of the academe but losing in the sidwalks of Everytown, USA. He reminds us that if evolution hopes to win the day, it must roll up its sleeves and accept the fact that public relations is what we must do.

2814963,5,B000PATZKQ,"I've always rather enjoyed watching documentaries.  They were playing this one on the premium channels and for some reason I could just never catch the whole thing.  Eventually I just got fed up and decided to buy it since it seemed worth owning at any rate.  I read a vast amount of different subjects and two of those subjects involve Theology and Science.  So when I started hearing about this ""Intelligent Design"" theory (and I will now delineate this as theory from a literary perspective here, meaning entry definition #7 from dictionary.com ""guess or conjecture""), I thought it seemed plausible and made sense.  As I started looking into it a lot more I found the theory had many flaws.  When I watched this it really helped to explain the points of view in a very easy to understand manner.  I must say that I did learn a decent amount about the ""Intelligent Design"" theory from this film, of course this won't be my sole location, and I will also read books on this to find out what exactly the minute points are.

This is definitely a documentary for people who are tired of the Michael Moore philosophy of documentaries.  Randy Olson really doesn't barge in on people or make them feel uncomfortable.  I think, for that reason, this documentary will speak to more people and more sides of the argument.  Whereas a Michael Moore approach can come off as ""rude"" to some people.  As most people will undoubtedly notice that when you're being belligerent most people tend to either shut down or oppose you even more vehemently.  At least with Randy Olson's documentary it doesn't present an overbearing feel and gives the Intelligent Design believers their fair shake to explain what they believe.  I think Olson expertly hits the nail on the head with what the real problem is in this kind of a ""debate"".  (I put debate in quotes, because it's technically not.)

I think there are a few reasons why this stems even further than what is touched here in the documentary.  From a scientific perspective evolution is a fact.  However, it's listed as a ""theory of evolution"", and I think a major reason why non-scientists say to themselves ""well it might not be true"" is because most people don't know what it really takes for something to even be logged in as a theory in a science book.  I think this is where science has essentially lost contact with humanity in some respects, and it's quite clear people can't be responsible to learn it on their own.  So now all these people who think they understand what ""theory"" means from a literary perspective and not a scientific perspective walk into School Boards across the country and want to change science... for after all, it is just a theory.  Not exactly, you need to go from a hypothesis to a theory.  To get to the level of something being a theory it needs to be peer reviewed, and most importantly duplicated by multiple people.  It's the ability to duplicate the research and come out with the SAME results that makes it a theory.  It's a theory because it CAN undergo refinement.  Like Charles Darwin's initial theory for survival of the fittest.  It's been over a hundred years since that was proposed and just about everything in the ""Origin of Species"" has undergone refinement and changed.  So to essentially say that this is where evolutionary thinking is, is basically saying that science is stuck in the 1800's, which it, most assuredly, is not.  It's the same principle as the ""laws"" in the fields of physics.  Does the general population really think that Newton's law of gravitation hasn't been refined?  If they do then they are not keeping up because when Einstein came along it needed refinement... and that was just over fifty years ago.  This is the problem, people have lost touch with the scientific community and I think that a greater deal of communication is in order.

The part Olson really nailed was that for the most part scientists are really bad at communicating this to the general public.  Olson does take a very light hearted approach to all this, after all he is a scientist as well, so he really can't berate them too much.  Though for a scientist, I think he communicates quite well with the public and he's the kind of guy science needs to help educate the greater populace about what's going on.

On the other side, he spoke to quite a few people on the intelligent design camp.  I think he gave them a fair enough shake in letting them throw their ideas out there.  He didn't badger them or tell them they were wrong, he merely asked questions on the subject.  It seemed almost unanimous that when it came time to question the theory of evolution they felt the side of the evolution was rude or belligerent.  This doesn't help communicate the idea properly.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the nicest guy in the world, but even I have enough wit to adjust my delivery if it's just not being heard.  Olson specifically covered the issue in the school board in Kansas (since it's his home area) and I was quite shocked that this was even considered.  I'm not one to say you can't believe what you want, but if you're going to start playing something off as scientific rigor that isn't, then, yes, I do have an issue with that.  If I decide to have kids, I don't want them to grow up in a world where it is acceptable to stop asking questions of the world around them and summarily decide that, ""oh, I don't get it.  God must be the answer.""  I don't think that would be acceptable on both sides, and I know that's not the point of their argument, but it could be an adverse affect if this policy is brought in to play.  And where does it really stop... when we finally end up in a world that is portrayed in ""Fahrenheit 451"" where people aren't allowed to question anything anymore?

From what I can perceive another problem that has lasted for centuries is that for people to clamor about their beliefs and not let science be performed correctly.  One of the scientists in the poker game brought up the Catholic Church suppressing Galileo because it didn't support their way of thinking and Galileo was observing a Copernican model.  I think a lot of scientists know about these kinds of historical references, far more than the general public, and for their profession to be in jeopardy because of faith seems to be like they're reliving something that already happened in some senses.  So I can see why scientists would get quite annoyed when someone purporting a ""God in the gaps"" theory comes along and tells them they don't have their facts straight.  I'm really not surprised at the rude backlash against the intelligent design theory.  I think the people in the intelligent design camp should probably start trying to look at it from the perspective of the scientists to understand why they're being rude.  Scientists probably can't even believe this is being debated; I for one really can't either, but scientists also need to look at it from the perspective of non-scientists as well to really explain their points.  What shocks me even more is that at some point someone could make this a lesson in the classroom.

I think this documentary really helps elevate people's awareness to the major problems with this issue, especially since it shouldn't be.  This should spark some peoples concern and generate good discussions, because that's exactly what this does.  Unfortunately for the Intelligent Design side, on this DVD it seems their arguments are really very weak.  He even spoke to their greatest spokesman; Dr. Behe (whose book I haven't read yet, but now am more prompted to read).  A lot of the people arguing on the side of intelligent design don't really understand the major intricacies of evolution and that was made very clear.  Olson even tore down one of the books they point to in order to reference the problems in evolution: ""Icons of Evolution.""  This book apparently takes the perspective that kids are still learning science the same way it was taught in the 1800's.  This just isn't accurate.  This is also coming from a guy who says that ""Darwinism is anti-Christian"" in his book ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design.""  This is just a stupid statement, I'm sorry, but I have to call it that because that's what it is.

However, I cannot berate the Intelligent Design group too harshly because in some cases they ask absolutely excellent questions of science.  Such as when they ask for a specific thing to be explained, like flagellum bacteria.  These points will simply send some scientist to go and figure it out, which is great for science and some scientist did go out and do that.  I do think science should be questioned and I think everyone benefits in the end when tough questions are asked.  However, to say science should stop researching and just say ""god's the reason this happened"" is a faulty argument.  It honestly seems to be implied that this is what people that support intelligent design would want.  Dr. Behe has already convinced himself that he's right, and he's convinced a lot of others as well, but that doesn't mean scientists should just give up.  Galileo gave up after being summarily threatened, I don't want to go back to a world like that... a world that is flat and happens to revolve around the sun that is.  These arguments have been going on since the Middle Ages; they seriously need to be put to rest.

The 10 questions part of the DVD which is about another 80 minutes is an excellent addition.  I personally would have liked to watch the full two presentations on this because they were very intriguing.  Namely that one of the major arguments against Intelligent Design is that it's not actually science.  If it was science and peer reviewed then authors like Jonathan Wells would have the support of the scientific community, and that what Dr. Behe says is factually correct.  The 10 questions also prompted me to go and purchase books by Michael Ruse because he seemed to explain things in a very interesting and excellent way.  They also have some deleted scenes where Dr. Behe says he's not so concerned about what is taught in public schools because his kids don't go to public school, this is from the man who typically speaks at the school board hearings to convince the school to teach intelligent design.  Olson mentioned he could have made a big deal out of it, but decided not to.  There is also an excellent humorous skit debate with comedians poking fun at the circus this country has turned into over this subject.  I found it to be pretty smart and funny, other reviewers clearly haven't.

All in all, this is a great product.  This sums up both sides excellently and really delves into what is and what is not well researched.  In the end Olson does take the side of evolution and states that he wasn't really convinced by the intelligent design arguments, because they didn't have that much weight behind them.  I, for one, was tired of hearing Dr. Behe's Mt Rushmore argument towards the end of the documentary because it is not a good argument and shouldn't even be used to argue against science.  For one it is documented that mankind built it, so to bring that into some estranged hypothetical scenario that God might have done something makes no sense.  Not to mention the rocks look like humans from OUR history.  If you really wanted to use an argument like that, use something like the face that was seen on Mars years ago because we have no record of humans building a structure that looks like that on another planet.  Either way it's a rather preposterous argument.  I highly recommend this DVD, it really makes you think about where the education system is heading and what we can possibly do about it.",1203897600,4,11744,4.671046228710463
2814964,5,B000PATZKQ,"It does seem like a flock of dodos, with religious zealots once again promoting divine design, or rather intelligent design, in the creation of the heavens and the earth.  Smartly, these groups have done away with the Biblical timeline of events and pretty much accept geological history, as Randy Olson points out in this humorous look at the seemingly endless Creation v. Evolution debate.  Olson also shows that evolution scientists haven't done themselves any favors by being so smug, assembling a group of renown scientists around a poker table who thought the debate dead and buried, while he goes on the road to track down the various members of the Kansas state school board that voted to bring the creation theory back into the classroom.  In the end, he asks who would you rather play poker with, and one has to admit that the members of the Kansas school board do seem much more fun.

While expressing his concerns, I think Olson sees that the debate has generated more interest in science and that it is not necessarily a bad idea to bring the debate back into the fore.  He would prefer to keep it out of the classroom, or at least the science classroom, as there is very little scientific creedence to intelligent design, and its proponents have promulgated a number of half-truths and downright lies in making its feeble case that the theory of evolution is unteneble.  Olson shows how intelligent design advocates like to claim that Haeckel's illustrated fetal charts are still being used in classrooms to teach evolution.  The dubious charts were phased out long ago, and try as he and one of the advocates might, they could find no reference to Haeckel's charts in any recent textbook.

But, most amusing of all, was the attempt by intelligent design advocates to compare the geological making of mountains to that of Mount Rushmore, claiming that it is god's hand at work.",1197244800,3,1891,4.814814814814815
2814965,4,B000PATZKQ,"Writer/director/narrator Randy Olson stars in this documentary exploring some of the ideas driving the Creationism vs. Evolution controversy. By utilizing light-hearted, graphical animations juxtaposed with first-hand interviews, the filmmaker makes fairly entertaining work of fleshing out a few of the fundamental issues underlying the debate.

The film begins at the narrator's home, where he explains a little about himself and his background before embarking on a personal journey to explore the intelligent design controversy through interviews with some its leading proponents. As the filmmaker himself explains, he is an evolutionary biologist, so it is pretty clear from the outset as to which side of the debate he subscribes.

His interviews with scientists and advocates are insightful and thought-provoking. To his credit, the filmmaker seems to make an honest attempt to engage his subjects in a rational, open exchange of ideas, and for the most part succeeds in presenting viewpoints that are contrary to his own personal position.

If there is a weak point in the film, for me personally it lies in the fact that it seems to lose focus when it moves from the purely substantive, scientific arguments and wanders into the more political aspects of the controversy (i.e., religious fundamentalism, separation of church and state, etc.) as well as the individual and corporate personalities influencing the present debate.

For example, the concept of irreducible complexity is introduced and explained fairly well through graphical representations and personal interviews with leading proponents. However, rather than presenting a solid counter-argument from the pro-evolutionist side based solely upon scientific reasoning, he instead shifts toward the financial funding aspects of the pro-intelligent-design movement and what its underlying motivations might be.

Personally, I would have preferred if the film stuck to the scientific arguments so I could decide for myself which side I believe.

I suppose presenting some of the personalities involved may provide part of the ""entertainment"" aspect of the film, and might be included to appeal to a wider audience. The card game with the obnoxious, wine-drinking, evolutionary ""intellectuals"" is certainly an example of this, as are some of the other characters presented, including the pro-intelligent-design school board member embroiled in political turmoil, and the filmmaker's own rather eccentric mother, who late in life has adopted a Buddhist philosophy because, ""it's a happy religion.""

I was not disappointed with this film. All in all, I found it to be an entertaining work aimed primarily at those preferring slightly more substance to their viewing regiment, rather than the typical ""bubble-gum"" fare that seems to pervade popular culture today. I would, however, have enjoyed seeing more of the substantive arguments and fewer of the political and character-driven aspects of the issue.",1196294400,4,2969,5.628635346756152

I unexpectedly caught myself laughing during this film, finding it both humorous AND insightful.  The multiple interviews were constructive and gave viewers insight to the broad spectrum of attitudes on this issue.  Well done!",1192320000,4,444,5.567164179104478
2814969,5,B000PATZKQ,"I don't usually feel the need to leave feedback, but Dr. Olson's poignant and clever documentary Flock of Dodos really got me thinking about things differently.  Times when my perspective changes, or even shifts a little, are worth noting.

I am a high school biology teacher in a rather conservative town.  I consider myself a Christian, but also believe that evolution and religion aren't at odds.  As an educator, I am often frustrated that others in the field turn so many good, and yes, intelligent, people away from science because they refuse to acknowledge that much of the country and world do not hold the same set of beliefs that they do.  Many of my students arrive in biology class opposed to hearing about Darwin because they have been raised to believe all scientists are atheists liberals.  I have learned it takes patience, understanding, and tolerance to be effective and so many in science treat this sensitive topic without regard to other perspectives and values.  Attacking someone's core set of beliefs is a losing strategy.

Dr. Olson's film is a masterpiece because he gets this problem across in an engaging way that resonates with me.  Yes, many scientists are dodos when it comes to debate and exchanging ideas.  You cannot hope to provide a convincing argument when you begin by being close-minded and argumentative.  Flock of Dodos is fun, funny, and makes a statement about where we are as a nation.  If we have any hope of evolving and moving forward by incorporating the best science into the average American experience, this film should serve as a wake up call.

I am online purchasing Flock of Dodos to show to my 9th grade students.  They will laugh and my hope is that they will also think about things differently and even be more open to new ideas.",1192147200,10,1788,4.7817589576547235
2814970,5,B000PATZKQ,"As many scientists talk about the crisis today undermining the future of science education in our school systems in general (and in Pennsylvania and Kansas specifically), Dr. Olson undertakes the task of actually doing something about it and travels to our heartland to get an inside look.  Here is a film that shows in a clever, light-hearted, and HUMOROUS way that, though Intelligent Design may be promulgated by a group of likeable do-gooders, ID is nonetheless Creationism clad in a cheap tuxedo.

The crab-eater seal teeth, what bunnies do at night, and the fact that ""the heart is really designed for a cardiologist"" are marvelous scenes.  As is the revealing poker games of (verging on arrogant) scientists.  The film is not only a fun lesson in evolution but also a brave insight into communicating.",1192147200,5,808,5.007462686567164
2814971,3,B000PATZKQ,"As a supporter of evolution education, I was really looking forward to seeing this lighthearted film. The concept of contrasting the haughty presentation style of some academics with the simple logic ""good plain folks"" supporting creationism looked like a winner. The premise is right on. Evolution science needs a more effective and friendly public media presence.
Sadly, the production values and exposition of this film were a somewhat of a disappointment. Flock of Dodos looks like a low-budget production with grabshot camera work, cheesy graphics and title design. This would be more acceptable if the documenatry focused more on the task of showing how part of the ID movement is a well-funded PR machines and how this subversive power is used to influence the ""nice creationist believers"" that are shown. Flock of Dodos gets caught up in the carnival atmosphere of the controversial subject and delivers a cinematic theme park of disconnected interviews, graphics, historical images, and personal family history.  For my taste, the filmmakers mother, Muffy Moose, while quite a character, was also a distraction.
I kept waiting for this film to settle down and deliver an intellectual or emotional punch... it never happened.
Flock of Dodos needed more of a focused, edgy style of comedy. I imagined a well crafted monologue instead of a steady string of one liners - more like George Carlin or Lewis Black and less like Larry the Cable Guy.
The DVD features a bonus section that includes some additional commentary and outakes, including a pathetic debate skit that was fortunately scrapped in post production, but also some asides that, to me, were far more interesting than the film itself - particularly ID guru Dr. Michael Behe's candor regarding his indifference to public education. I would have preferred it if the film-makers would have incorporated two or three of these comments into the conclusion.
Flock of Dodos is worth seeing once, but it's not a film with the impact or staying power that one might have hoped for.",1192060800,10,2039,5.104790419161676
2814972,5,B000PATZKQ,"Great documentary on the evolution v. creationism debate. The filmmaker makes it clear that he is an evolutionist, and yet treats creationists extremely fairly. All the creationists interviewed in the film were very satisfied with how they were portrayed. The only group upset at this film is the Discovery Institute, who refused to respond to the filmmaker's requests for inclusion in the film. They refused to make a showing in the film, then complain about how they were portrayed in the film. I don't think Mr. Olson could have done anything more.

This film addresses specific points of debate, but more than that it uncovers some tactics used in the debate and shows the character of the individuals involved. Olson gives each interviewee plenty of time to make their points. In general though, this film has more entertainment value, and a little less substantive value, though this is just what many people need.",1191542400,5,920,5.0130718954248366

2814974,5,B000PATZKQ,"I watched this movie first on Showtime before it was available on DVD.  I loved it! It was easy to understand and very humorous in addition to being very informative, even my 11 year old son enjoyed it.

I found it unusually refreshing that this issue was raised by a fellow scientist and I am glad it is finally coming to light in this medium.  I have often wondered why scientist's don't feel the need or even think it is their responsibility to relate to the average person on matters that they have been educated in.  The majority of them write books and publish journals only for their peers and even look down on people who don't have an understanding of their background.

Studies and statics show that less then 26% of Americans don't understand a basic scientific article in a newspaper! Obviously we need more people who are educated to speak out!  Randy Olsen brings this issue to the surface and holds his fellow scientist's responsible for helping in this crucial problem.

Thank You Randy so much for making this much needed film! You are my personal hero!",1190246400,5,1070,4.62962962962963
8190163,4,B000PATZKQ,"This easygoing, lighthearted documentary about the evo-creto dispute doesnt spend much time on technical, evidentiary issues; rather it basically just presents one experts definition of intelligent design, discusses two significant political actions by school boards trying to promote ID, and examines each sides communication strategies.

Some highlights/comments:

Michael Behe, perhaps IDs best known scientist, says ID hypothesizes that design can be detected in nature.  Thats basically it.  No testable hypotheses, just gut feelings about seeing design.

Some ID-ers claim that Dodos doesnt succeed in refuting ID, but if ID is basically just gut feelings on the level of seeing Jesus face in a piece of burnt toast, then theres really not much worth refuting.  Just pointing and laughing is probably sufficient.

IDs hopelessly amorphous gut feelings allow almost everything, exclude almost nothing, and are therefore scientifically meaningless.  For example, Behes gut feelings explicitly accept common descent, but many other ID-ers have gut feelings that vehemently reject that hypothesis.  Similarly, Behes gut feelings accept that Earth is ancient and that life on Earth changed dramatically over long periods, but millions of other ID-ers have gut feelings that vehemently reject both of those hypotheses.  Many ID-ers have bizarrely schizophrenic gut feelings that accept that Darwinian evolution can cross the substantial genetic distance between cows, sheep, and buffalo, but not the much smaller genetic distance between chimps and humans.  Huh???

So ID is essentially worthless in biology, because, unlike evolution, IDs capricious gut feelings don't take a principled stand on any scientifically meaningful issue.

That difference between evolution and ID is also reflected in their respective communication strategies.  ID-ers use simplistic slogans, like teach the controversy, and illogical God-of-the-gaps arguments aimed at gullible Christians; while evos write detailed research papers aimed at highly experienced, world-renowned experts.  Evos present their research at formal scientific conferences and respond in meaningful ways to substantive critiques.  ID-ers present their arguments to church groups and either ignore substantive critiques or lie about them, as the Discovery Institute (a.k.a. Dishonesty Institute) did when important new research indicated that one of Behes main arguments in Edge of Evolution was completely wrong.

ID-ers complain that evos are mean, while evos complain that ID-ers are ignorant and dishonest.  Perhaps they should compromise:  Evos should try to be nicer, and ID-ers should try to be better educated and less dishonest.

Dodos also discusses two ID-inspired attacks on evolution in 2005 by school boards in Kansas and Dover, PA.

Jack Cashill, a prominent ID-er in the Kansas war on evolution, claimed that ID has little or nothing to do with religion, but when he named the two main ID-activists in the Kansas war, they both turned out to be devout Christians.  Hmm.  I have a strong gut feeling about a recognizable pattern developing here!

Indeed, the Kansas Board of Education conducting the inquisition against evolution was dominated by conservative Christians.  Similarly, the Dover school board was dominated by conservative Christians, one of whom used a Jesus-reference to justify adding ID to the curriculum, and another of whom used money from a local churchs Sunday collection to buy ID-textbooks.  Cashill doesnt think theres anything religious about Jesus-based arguments and church collections???  OMG!

The Kansas show trial featured several devout Christians as pro-ID witnesses from the Dishonesty Institute, which, not surprisingly, consists largely of, and is funded largely by, devout Christians.  Some of DIs fund-raising efforts even included obvious religious appeals.  Cashill doesnt see any hint of religion there???

Unlike the robust role of religion in ID, the role of science in ID seems to be almost nil.  Phillip Johnson, a leading ID-er cited in Dodos, publicly proclaimed that ID is not and never was about science, rather it is about religion and philosophy.  Not surprisingly, ID generates no scientific research at all.  William Harris, another leading ID-er, admitted that he had never presented even a single scientific paper about ID at any science conference; and, during his laughably bungled testimony in the Dover trial, Behe made a similar admission about avoiding science conferences.

Some of IDs expert witnesses in the Kansas circus admitted during cross-examination that they hadnt even read the science standards they were testifying about.  Alarmed that their star witnesses were looking more like incompetent buffoons, one board member (a conservative Christian) tried to help out by telling one beleaguered witness not to worry about not having read the standards, because she hadnt read them either!  (Its heart-warming to see conservative Christians so dedicated to improving our childrens education!)

Dodos also discusses why evos seemed to be losing the communications battle.

Dodos probably puts too much blame on evos.  Granted, some evos are not very good communicators, especially compared to IDs slick con artists, who have spent years practicing how to mislead gullible Christians; but its important to keep in mind the different levels of complexity involved.  Evolution offers mountains of detailed, wide-ranging, intricately interrelated data; while ID offers soothing nonsense about gut feelings.  Obviously its a lot more difficult to communicate the intricate, data-rich evo message than the vacuous ID message.

Also, creationist attacks on evolution are frequently, blatantly dishonest; and a con mans glib deceitfulness is often more convincing to gullible rubes than complex truths.  Its important to remember that the evolution-deniers in this country are generally conservative Christians, the same people who voted in droves last year for a routinely (pathologically?) dishonest con man to be President, and who are apparently poised to vote a few days from now for a similarly dishonest, reputed pedophile from Alabama to be a U.S. Senator.  Being devoted to the truth is apparently not one of the core characteristics of conservative Christians.  You cant blame evos for that!

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, IDs alleged victories didn't last very long,  The federal judge in the Dover case ruled that ID was both idiotic and religious (sorry, Jack Cashill!); which largely put an end to IDs victories around the entire U.S., including in Kansas.  So maybe ignorance and dishonesty aren't a winning strategy after all!",1512086400,,6680,5.632

His own mother, herself a character in the documentary, after her strenuous opposition to any criticism of evolution, confesses in the end that she believes in reincarnation! :) All the movie debunks is Young Earth Creationism, a very easy and convenient ""straw man"". As Behe himself explains, ID is compatible with common descent, micro-evolution old age for the Earth, and the fact of macro-evolution (although not its proposed natural selection and random mutation proposed Neo-Darwinian mechanism). On the other hand evolution does not even address life's origin. Unlike micro-evolution, macro -evolution has not even been observed, so that it happened the way Darwin thought and in no other possible way is purely conjectural.

The guy did absolutely no research, and instead talked with other evolutionists that were so set in their beliefs that anything said against them was met with cussing and sarcasm. The intelligent design people he interviewed gave good analogies, but no one --evolutionists included--actually gave evidence for their side. The questions posed to ID (Intelligent Design) supporters weren't about evidence: they were about theology. And those were weak, at best.

For those hoping to watch this for educational value, there is none. Except for maybe seeing the standard evolutionist reaction to anything remotely suggesting that there is a purpose behind the universe. If you do watch it, skip ahead as soon as you see guys sitting around a blue table. During those bits, all they do is cuss (mainly the Lord's name in vain; coincidence?) and slam down anyone trying to voice any doubts for ID.

Deeply disappointed. Olson was right about one thing, though: It is fully unconstitutional to make it mandatory to teach Creationism in public schools. But it is not illegal to teach it in a public school, if the teacher so wishes. Freedom of speech and of belief. That's what America is. Or should be.
