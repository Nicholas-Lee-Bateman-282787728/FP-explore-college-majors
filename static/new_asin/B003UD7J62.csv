4195379,5,B003UD7J62,"My Happy Endings: The Complete First Season on DVD arrived today and I'm thrilled to be able to watch the show repeatedly. The characters are original and the writing is fabulous. This 2-disc set (not yet available on Blu-ray Disc) contains all 12 original episodes broadcast on ABC in late winter / early spring of 2011. The 13th episode is a bonus episode because it was released on television months after the season finale in August 2011, even after it was announced the series was renewed for a 2nd season. I love the special features included and will enjoy this t.v. show on DVD in my library for years to come.",1318204800,,618,4.576576576576577
4195380,5,B003UD7J62,"My wife and I have been watching this show from day one and love it!  The cast is great, the story lines are hilarious and we can't wait for Season 2 to begin.  Its one of the best comedies/shows on TV.  If you like Modern Family, Friends (yes I know dated...) and are looking for a great comedy, try this out.  We want to get the upcoming season expanded to a full 22 episodes and keep it going!  Everyone tune in...Wednesday nights!",1316908800,,434,4.2439024390243905

4195382,5,B003UD7J62,"Great characters, great acting, great script, great settings. Better than ""Friends"" and if it continues, could be as good or better than ""Seinfeld!""",1315612800,,148,5.478260869565218
4195383,5,B003UD7J62,"I watched the pilot episode of this show when it first aired out of curiosity. I wasn't expecting much, but it ended up being surprisingly not bad so I decided to stick with it. It didn't take long before I was hooked. I looked forward to Wednesday nights just so I could get another dose of it. This show is so funny and enjoyable. The cast is great, especially Adam Pally and Casey Wilson, who play really well off each other. I am so glad ABC renewed this for a second season. While it already has a small following I'm hoping it can catch on with even more viewers in Season 2. Give this show a chance! Just don't give up on it right away if you don't instantly love it. It gets better and better.",1315440000,10,701,4.161764705882353
4195384,5,B003UD7J62,"This show is effing hilarious. The first episode I was really iffy about but by the end of the second episode I was literally laughing out loud. As the season progresses you get attached to all the characters and love them even more. They are unique characters that play sooo well off of eachother. My favorite character is Penny or Max. Max is definitely an a-typical gay guy and it's refreshing. Give it a try, it's TOTES HILAR!",1313884800,6,430,4.5256410256410255
4195385,5,B003UD7J62,"When I first watched this show, I thought it was mediocre at best.  Then at about episode four, I started to love it.  It takes a lot for a show to literally make me ""lol"", but this show does it.

The show is about a group of six friends living their life in Chicago.  The main storyline running through the first season, revolved around Dave and Alex. In the first episode, Dave and Alex are set to be married but she ends up leaving him at the altar for a past fling that comes in at the last minute on rollerblades, confessing his undying love for her. Thus the group is forced to figure out how to handle the situation because they're all still best friends.  During all of this, we also get little side story arcs from some of the other characters and to be honest, they are the funnier ones.

You have Max who is not your stereotypical gay guy (which is quite refreshing to say the least) and he is probably the most hilarious character on the show. He has the best lines. His best friend, Penny, is also quite hilarious and she is desperate and single. This leads to one of my favorite episodes of the first season in which Penny dates a hipster. Hilarity ensues.

Next up, you have Brad and Jane. They are the only married ones of the bunch. Brad is your token metrosexual (who is more gay than Max) and Jane is your typical control freak.  It's fun to see how Jane handles the groups problems and exactly how far she'll go to prove that she will win at anything. Their relationship with one another is quite funny.

What makes the show great is that all the characters are believable. We all have someone in our set of friends that matches up with at least one of the characters on the show. The cast has great chemistry together and it shows. I'm so glad it was renewed for a second season, because more people need to give it a chance.  It's well written, modern, and hilarious.

Definitely worth a purchase!",1312588800,8,1919,4.332402234636872
4195386,5,B003UD7J62,"Like the previous reviewer, I thought for the longest time that I was the only one watching this hilarious show, despite great efforts to pass the good word along. ""Happy Endings"" is a completely underrated comedy gem that has me and my friends laughing out loud several times an episode! It's like ""Friends,"" only way goofier and more modern. Needless to say, I am SO happy that ABC was smart enough to pick this show up for a second season!",1311292800,23,442,4.5375
4195387,4,B003UD7J62,"I watched Happy Endings on Hulu after it premiered because I had heard vaguely of it - and it was a good decision.  What sounded like a hard-to-continue concept, Alex(Elisha Cuthbert) leaves her fiance Dave (Zachary Knighton) at the alter and the fallout as their long-time friends try to avoid choosing ""sides,"" actually worked here.  The supporting cast of friends include married couple Jane and Brad (Eliza Coupe and Damon Wayans Jr.), perpetually single Penny (Casey Wilson), and Max (Adam Pally, a breath of fresh air in that he plays a gay character whose main source of comedy is not that he's ""the gay guy"").

A word of warning, ABC aired a few episodes OBVIOUSLY out of order.  The show appears to dismiss the problem where Alex left Dave at the alter rather briskly and then we see them trying to stay friends and move on - and what's odd is the group's easy chemistry and the fun writing mean you don't mind too much.  Later, though, you'll see a pair of episodes that show Alex and Dave fighting and struggling to come to terms with the end of their relationship before recognizing that they can eventually still be friends.  These were clearly meant to air second and third.  If you watch them in this order, the friendship will probably seem more organic than the quick fix of the second episode as aired.

Other than this hiccup, this first season is fun and light.  Cuthbert and Knighton play their relationship perfectly - they have years of history and still like each other as people, but play those awkward moments where one starts to move on romantically quite poignantly.  The transition is never made to look easy.  Coupe, most well-known perhaps for her turn on the later seasons of Scrubs, is hilarious as the control-freak Jane and Wayans plays the long-suffering husband with just the right amount of tolerance born out of love.

The episode that I would hands-down show to any first-time viewer is Dave of the Dead.  The heart-warming A-story is Dave trying to revisit his dream of opening a restaurant (his idea is terrible, but Jane doesn't want anyone to crush his dream yet).  However, it is the B-story that steals the show: Penny meets a great funny guy while doing laundry (and of course wearing their awkward laundry day outfits) only to discover that he ACTUALLY dresses like that.  Max has the best line here: ""Penny, you know what he is?  He's a hipster.  Everything that you like, he likes ironically.""  He takes her to an underground mix tape party and invites her and the group to a 90's-themed bat mitzvah, but is immediately disgusted when Penny actually dresses up for the theme because it seems like she's trying too hard.

I was convinced I was the only person watching this show (though I sent links for Dave of the Dead to everyone!) and was delighted that ABC renewed it.  Hopefully it can be paired with something strong in the fall to get the viewership it deserves.",1311120000,31,2919,4.686274509803922

4195498,5,B003UD7J62,"This is one of the funniest shows on TV. It's basically about a group of 20-something friends who hang out in Chicago. Brad and Jane are the married couple. Besides their obvious difference, Brad is laid back while Jane has a neurotic, competitive, Type A personality. Alex is Jane's attractive little sister. Alex left her fianc Dave at the altar. This leads to complicated feelings between the two throughout season 1. Penny is a shallow airhead who is obsessed with finding the perfect boyfriend. Max is Dave's best friend. Max is gay, but he acts straight. He's into sports.

The show has a weird type of humor. It's not like the conventional type of humor on shows like Friends. It's more like the type of humor on shows like Scrubs and Parks and Recreation. They make a lot of black and gay jokes, but as a black guy, I'm not offended. My favorite episode of season 1 was Mein Coming Out when Max came out to his parents. Another funny episode was The Girl with the David Tattoo when Brad and Penny got a waiter fired. All of the characters are funny, but my two favorite characters are Max and Penny.

I seriously don't know why ABC cancelled this series. It wasn't a heavily promoted series. I discovered it by accident. I guess that the only thing people watch these days are reality shows, singing competitions, and sports. It's not like the 1990's when there were a whole bunch of sitcoms.",1432598400,,1400,4.573705179282869
4195519,5,B003UD7J62,This is the season that launched so many careers.. The writing was so pitch perfect.. fresh original and most of all FUNNY... the latter season focused a bit too much on Max's gay life and that angle took over the show's many plot lines too much... (btw I'm gay) ... But this first season all the cast members shine with great writing and great acting... and I'm in love with Dave Rose and his midwestern white lib character...

4195536,2,B003UD7J62,"The show feels like it was written by upper middle class white, non gay, people from Orange County. There is no mass appeal to the show. Everyone on the show is attractive (not even close to average), everyone is extremely superficial and the one chance they had to do something slightly interesting with the gay character completely fell flat. The gay character is the most boring character on the show. Oh, but wait this is a gay character that isn't flamboyant that's edgy right? No, it's just boring. There were several episodes where the characters keep giving the gay character a hard time because he's overweight. Overweight? Apparently in shiny happy town that guy of pretty average weight is considered overweight by all the rest of the stick figure characters. The women sit around and judge everyone else, particularly their seemingly never ending list of male model suitors. Penny who by all account is what I would call a ""big"" girl has one model looking boyfriend after another. To say the men she dates are out of her league would be putting it mildly. Yet somehow every where she goes these men that look like they are straight out of a magazine are lining up to date this extremely average woman. It's almost like this show was written by a woman who wishes this is how life really is. ""I don't care about substance just give me a never ending line of hot guys to date to fill the emptiness in my life that I attempt to fill by purchasing things I can't afford."" Rarely have I seen a show that so closely resembles the life of your average superficial LA person (yes I know the show is not set in LA having spent a lot of time in both Chicago and LA (unfortunately) this show is much closer to LA life than Chicago). LA is hell. If hell were real for me it would be living my life surrounded by the fake/superficial people of LA. If what I wrote upsets you than you are who I'm talking about. The young professional who buys a mac cause it's cool (see the glowing apple on the back of my computer, that means I'm one of the cool guys right) and a new iphone every time they come out because, heck, you can't be caught holding last year's model phone. How would that look? It would make me look poor and unpopular right?. The guys on this show bond over wait for it...sports! (what a shocker). The black guy on the show is whiter than the white guys. Clearly there were no black writers. Oh, and everyone on the show lives in apartments/condos that your average surgeon would live in but these people with average jobs can somehow afford these giant palaces.

If you are a metrosexual this show was made for you. If you live in LA you will love this show. If you are distracted by shiny objects you will love this show. If you are a woman who carries your dog around in a bag you will love this show. If you like Kim Kardashian you will love this show. If you are more concerned with how someone looks than who they are as a person than you will love this show.

My family soon caught on and we all enjoyed it. We were unhappy when it was cancelled by ABC, and hoped it would find a new home on another network (Hulu, Netflix, cable, etc.). A year has passed, we're still unhappy with that decision. However, we still watch the reruns on VH1, and still find time to laugh. I'm most likely going to purchase all 3 seasons of this show on DVD and pray for a feature-length theatrical movie somewhere in the future.

4195698,5,B003UD7J62,"I stumbled onto this show about halfway through the second season (Ep #16 - Cocktails & Dreams). I had heard plenty of positive takes on the show, but already having a full plate of television shows to watch, I let it fall by the wayside. I also have an issue with not wanting to watch a show unless I start it from the very beginning. Well luckily Hulu decided to autoplay this particular episode after an episode of Cougar Town (another underrated gem), because I instantly fell in love, and haven't stopped watching. While it will never replace Arrested Development (Really though, will anything?) as the funniest show ever broadcast, it's quickly becoming my favorite comedy currently on TV (sitting right beside Parks & Rec and Community).

While quite funny in the early episodes, it really begins to shine as the series progresses and the writers begin to get a better feel for who these characters are. Definitely give it a watch, and at least check out the first 4 or 5 eps to get an idea of what you're in for. You won't regret it.",1339545600,,1041,4.596774193548387

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Happy Endings"" is a series that has won me over!

When the comedy series ""Scrubs"" ended its final season, the one thing I would miss is its insane humor and the writers willing to take on comedy and trying to push the envelope of what can be accomplished on national television.

We have seen that kind of insanity and craziness on television with ""Cougar Town"" (created by ""Scrubs"" creator Bill Lawrence) and Dan Harmon with his comedy series ""Community"" and now we see it with David Caspe's ""Happy Endings"".

It took a few episodes for the cast to gel, but from the third episode on, things seemed natural and fun and if anything, its a series that has a crazy perspective towards relationships courtesy of its crazy characters and by watching the series and seeing the outtakes, it looks as if the talent can really improvise a bit and have fun with their character's own personal hijinks.

Personally, I'm not sure how much is scripted and how much is improvised but I will say that, whatever the writers are doing...I'm really enjoying the series!

It's great to see actress Elisha Cuthbert move away from the more dramatic role that she was known for in ""24' and play an ex-girlfriend Alex who is unsure about her friendship, relationship or whatever you want to call it with Dave (played by Zachary Knighton).

It's also great to see ""Scrubs"" actress Eliza Coupe return in another crazy role as the perfectionist Jane Williams, sister of Alex but then you have the three odd friends.

Casey Wilson as Penny Hartz who is like the 30-something friend who tries too hard to find a man, Adam Pally as the gay friend Max Blum who has an opinion for everything and Damon Wayans Jr. as Brad Williams who is the supportive friend who somehow gets stuck in doing things that he doesn't want to do.

The series is so crazy, for example in the episode ""Mein Coming Out"", Max's parents are coming to visit and he hasn't told them he is gay.  So, Jane tries to pretend she is his girlfriend and keeps french kissing him, despite being married to Brad.  As for Penny, she is Jewish but is in love with a guy who has the last name Hitler.  And as for Max's parents, they think that Dave is gay.  And what you get is a crazy episode where all things go wrong.  But it's so hilarious to watch!

This is just one example but there are 12-episodes just as crazy and anyone who is looking for a series about relationships, marriage and wacky friendships should really give ""Happy Endings"" a try.  Unlike ""Scrubs"" which took place in a hospital, ""Community"" which takes place in a community college and ""Cougar Town"" which takes place in the homes of neighbors, ""Happy Endings"" brings characters out to a variety of locations and the writers have fun with it.

It's an infectious comedy series!

As for the DVD, you get 13-episodes and a good number of short special features.  The outtakes were hilarious and it would be nice for season two if there are audio commentary tracks added, especially with the cast.  That would be fun to listen to!

While I feel it is still to early to know if this series has what it takes to last for multiple seasons, I did enjoy this first season and I can't wait for the second.  I love in which the characters are just crazy but I do love the setting of featuring a group of friends that are all different.  You have an interracial couple, a gay character, a couple who have a failed relationship and a neurotic Jewish woman...and somehow, the writers made these characters work well with each other and the talent, their chemistry is just right.

Overall, ""Happy Endings: The Complete First Season"" is a series for those who want to laugh and are open to humor similar to a series such as ""Scrubs"" and just want all out craziness.  I look forward in seeing where the writers take these characters for season two.

4195704,3,B003UD7J62,"Was introduced to this show by a friend, and thought that it was humorous overall.  Found that the episodes seem to be either hit or miss.  Read the previous reviews comparing the show to Friends, but think it more closely resembles How I Met Your Mother.  Didn't realize that Damon Wayans son stars in the show until I was reading the credits or no now I remember was looking at the cast list on the back of the dvd case.  Should have figured it out sooner when Damon Wayans actually plays Damon Wayans Jr. father.  That episode was definitely hilarious.  Even more so later when I realized they were related; can kind of see the resemblance.  Did anyone else realize Damon Wayans was that old?  Alright I'm getting off track, overall thought the show was funny.",1333497600,,763,4.5588235294117645
4195705,4,B003UD7J62,"It seems that most of what I'm writing about these days ends up being TV series. The thing is that there are more good TV series coming out these days than I've seen in some time. Which is odd since most people complain about how bad TV is these days. Those people need to watch a little more and DVD gives them the chance to do so. Take the new series HAPPY ENDINGS for example.

The series opens with the set up, a wedding for characters Dave (Zachary Knighton) and Alex (Elisha Cuthbert). As their vows are being exchanged, a rollerblading guy rolls in and tells Alex she can't go through with it, to come with him. She agrees and off they roll. What follows is a group of people that are friends of both individuals who must learn how to deal with staying friends with them while not alienating either.

So that's the set up. The thing is as each episode unfolds we get to see how their attempts fail and how Alex and Dave develop into friends as opposed to man and wife. All the while there's an undercurrent that perhaps these two are destined to be together and that maybe one day they'll realize that. Until then everyone walks on eggshells trying not to take one side or the other.

There are two things that make this show stick out from so many other comedies on these days. The first is the writing. The stories offer ways to move the idea of the friends dealing with issues that are brought into focus by the couples parting ways, by their friendship and eventually in how they deal with one another. The wordplay is witty and fast paced so much so that on occasion you need to back up to catch a line because you were laughing so hard. In jokes are also on hand, like referencing Cuthbert's role as Jack Bauer's daughter on the series ""24"" when one character says she acts like her.

The second thing that makes this series work is the character and the casting. Each actor portrays their role to perfection. Knighton as Dave seems like the loveable guy who was left at the alter only to move on to find his dream. Cuthbert is great as the runaway bride who followed an impulse only to realize later how it affected everyone else.

Rounding out the friends are interracial couple Jane and Brad Williams (Eliza Coupe and Damon Wayans, Jr.). Brad is an executive while Jane is Alex's sister, a competitive woman with a touch of OCD. Casey Williams stars as Penny Hart, the 30 year old single woman still searching for Mr. Right and nearly ready to accept anyone. Rounding out the group is Adam Pally as Max Blum, the not so obviously gay man who Dave ends up sharing an apartment with after the break up.

One of the greatest things about these characters is that while each could become an issue to press be it race or sexual preference, they instead are just all good friends. They support one another, they help one another and they seem like everyday folks rather than a rallying cry for some cause or another. When treated like just characters rather than symbols it becomes much easier to accept them as they should be accepted.

Episodes deal with so many issues that develop from the main set up as well as the characters. Everything including coming out to your parents, sleepwalking, opening up to your parent that you love them and my favorite who of two characters would survive in a zombie apocalypse. Yes indeed, Jane and Max compete with one another to decide who would be the one to carry on. Remember I said this was a comedy?

While watching this series I had to stop it occasionally until I could stop laughing. It was one of those DVDs that you begin watching and find yourself not wanting to turn off, instead looking at the clock and saying well I can sleep tomorrow night, I'll just watch one more episode. It's amazing how fast those half hour episodes fly by.

By the end of this collection you'll find yourself wanting more and you'll realize that this is a show you can watch the old ones of and still find yourself laughing. Yes, as with most comedies these days, there are the occasional risqu jokes, but nothing that was too blatant. All in all, while perhaps not a family comedy, this is one series that will make you laugh and be worth adding to your collection.",1332201600,,4206,4.451948051948052

4195729,5,B003UD7J62,"HAPPY ENDINGS is a delight - it is innovative, witty, intelligent and most importantly hilarious.  Many automatically compare it to FRIENDS for there are 6 main characters - 3 men and 3 women, but that is where all comparisons end.  This show is in no way a copy cat to any other show that has aired.  I fell in love with it when the 13 episodes of the first season aired and the awesome thing about getting the dvd is that the show when aired on network tv was not shown with the episodes in the order intended.  There is a basic plot here.  In the pilot Alex (Elisha Cuthbert) walks out during the wedding ceremony on her fince Dave (Zachary Knighton)  and the following episodes follow how they and their mutual friends deal with the fall-out of this.  Seeing them in order gives more depth to the characters and the story lines.

The show manages to shine in every way, each character is in no way a caricature and each actor is perfect in their given role.  Elisha Cuthbert comes from a serious role on 24 and shines.  My favorites though are Casey Wilson from SNL who plays Penny and Damon Wayans Jr. who plays Brad.  I was very upset when SNL just up and let go of Casey Wilson but it was truly their loss as she shines in a role that gives her a much better field of play than the now tired SNL.  Episodes are filled with heart and also honest insight into the characters.  And the writers deserve as much credit as the actors for each episode is filled with laughs and many that turn into full out belly laughs.  I highly recommend purchasing this wonderful first season of this great show.  And if you haven't given it a shot yet catch up with the second season that is airing now.  This is a show that just continues to get better and better.  It is fresh, witty and deserves a truly wide audience.  Give it a chance and I guarantee it will pull you in fully.",1325548800,,1870,4.279202279202279

4195734,5,B003UD7J62,"I'm going to review the boxset, not the series since if you haven't seen this series, i strongly suggest you stop right now and pick this up!
the boxset or case, is a simple dvd case that you would normally see on any single disc edition movie. but it houses two dvds. first 6 i believe are on disc one and remaining on disc 2. i have to note that the episodes were aired out of order as i'm sure all of you know, but thankfully the episodes are not out of order here in this boxset, so i was very pleased to see that corrected.

i have to say i loved the deleted scenes, especially for the first episode. the outtakes were HI-larious. there is no secondary language on this set, but there are subtitles in english only. disc two has an interview with two cast members but its really just a parody interview which was nice. and there is a really great remix music video featuring funny moments from season 1 that i think everyone needs to watch, its great! theres also a promo for several shows inclduing happy endings and the community and others which i thought was cool.

all in all, if you a fan of the tv show, please support it buy purchasing the set. i'm a lil confused as to why this series didn't get a bluray release, i'm assuming because they didn't know how it would do, so i fully expect a bluray release for the second season. so please buy this awesome set!",1321315200,2,1372,4.252873563218391

I've been enjoying the 2nd season even more.  I hope they can keep up the level of zaniness, not just in the story lines but each and every finely crafted performance.  Somebody mentioned Seinfeld, but I think, even though these are prickly, somewhat self-centered representatives of the aging youthful demographic, they're all very likable.  You shouldn't love Max, but you can't help yourself.  Kind of like Charlie in Always Sunny in Philadelphia.",1320710400,,624,4.609090909090909
