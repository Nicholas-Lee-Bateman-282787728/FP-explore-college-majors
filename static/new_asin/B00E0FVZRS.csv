5882395,5,B00E0FVZRS,"A rare look at the unvarnished truth behind the sins of the military as captured by the hacking skills and computer genius of Julian Assange, a true hero. Think about it. Do you think he was guilty of anything other than trying to save lives and expose murderous acts? He didn't serve a day in jail because what he did was heroic, albeit against the law. His entire life was devoted to helping innocent victims, women and children, avoid the death grip of the military.

No, it was not the slickest movie, done in the normal Hollywood spectacular fashion, with big name stars and electrifying high tech hijinks. The story needed no slick treatment. It stands on its own without the patina of a Hollywoodesque treatment.",1385164800,14,719,4.7063492063492065
5882396,5,B00E0FVZRS,"I guess that the old saying, ""Do as I say, not as I do,"" is an instance of the more formal ""argumentum ad baculum"" fallacy.  Basically, it uses force to ""prove"" a point, but actually it proves nothing except that you're a parent, or a bully -- or worse yet, that you're a parent AND a bully, which is probably very common -- or you have nuclear weapons.

And the US has probably been guilty of all of these things for quite a while now, maybe outside of the ""parent"" part.  What with intercepting Internet traffic and listening in on phone conversations from such people as Angela Merkel, the US certainly has some 'splainin' to do.  After all, it surely wouldn't be a great idea to listen in on one of the leaders of a country that has been one of the greatest US allies, at least since ""I Love Lucy"" first appeared on TV.

And this is the psychological setup for the film ""Underground;"" at least it was for me.  Julian Assange has been naturally demonized by at least the US government for quite awhile, but if you've been paying attention, when the US demonizes someone or something it means one of two things (this would be an ""either/or fallacy"" but you've been forewarned):  you're really bad, or you're really good.  Mr. Assange could probably be described as either one I suppose, depending upon one's perspective.

I have to admit that I am far from an expert on Mr. Assange myself.  I've read a few articles here and there and followed the news.  And now I've seen this film, which I'm assuming pushes some fact while it pushes some fiction.  I surprisingly didn't know that he is originally from Australia, but I learned that from this film and verified it with a quick Internet check.  And I also learned that this was a made-for-TV film in Australia, which is amazing if you think about it; this film is so much better than so much drivel that releases in theaters in the United States.  Wow.  I'll have to watch some more Australian films now that release first at their local movie theaters.  They must be really good.

This film reminded me of a mash-up of ""War Games,"" with Matthew Broderick, which had its moments; and perhaps the ""Bourne"" series with Matt Damon, which really had its moments, surely superior to the ""Bond"" series.  But this movie is based (hopefully) upon reality and it doesn't show too many people using martial arts.  While most sites have this film listed under the drama genre, I find this to be more of a thriller.  And I think it's a true thinking-man's thriller as well.

One of the smartest things that they did here:  they narrowed this film down to a very short timeframe in Mr. Assange's life, mostly when he was in his late teens and early 20s.  The screenplay didn't try to pour out his full life story, which was a very welcome surprise as it would then have easily become a watered-down mess.  And the acting is really sharp, especially by the lead Alex Williams.  Mr. Williams may not kick tail like Mr. Damon did in ""Bourne"" but his mental gymnastics might have been even more impressive.  Furthermore, Mr. Williams didn't overreach here at all; he is very natural in the role and I'd imagine that Mr. Assange himself would be impressed with the performance.  (When I watch a bio film, I try to imagine that I'm the true-life protagonist and how I'd feel about the project.  I gave a pass on ""Lincoln"" not too long ago for this very same reason.)

While I am impressed with this film, I'm more than disappointed with the US.  While it's hard to justify anyone hacking into a computer system -- I certainly am not inviting Mr. Assange to hack into my bank account, as an example -- it becomes even harder to justify demonizing someone when you do the same thing yourself.  Uncle Sam, to you I say, ""You have lost the right to a higher moral ground since you are guilty as well, no matter what parents may say.  Or even just because you have nuclear weapons.""

I'll go with a big recommendation here, as I hope that this film doesn't just stay ""Underground.""",1384473600,4,4010,4.509695290858725
5882397,5,B00E0FVZRS,"Well-done, and informative. Great cast and believable performances. I suggest watching the 2013 documentary ""We Steal secrets"" as a follow-up to this movie which focuses on Assange's work with WikiLeaks later in his career.",1383523200,12,223,5.588235294117647
5882398,3,B00E0FVZRS,"Underground is a film made for Australias Network Ten inspired by Suelette Dreyfus 1997 book Underground: Hacking, Madness, and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier that chronicled the exploits and subsequent arrests of elite computer hackers in Australia 1989-1991. Julian Assange, of WikiLeaks fame, was one of those hackers as well as a research assistant on the book. Renewed interest in Assange in the past couple of years was the motivation for a film about his teenaged hacking adventures. The film focuses on Assanges group of friends who called themselves The International Subversives: fellow hacker Prime Suspect, master phreaker Trax, and Mendax, Assange's online identity at the time.

The story begins as Christine Assange (Rachel Griffiths) argues with her creepy boyfriend, then flees with son Julian and his younger brother. This will explain the familys peripatetic lifestyle over the next few years. Next, Julian (Alex Williams) is in his late teens, unpacking a Commodore 64 computer in his familys new home in Emerald, Victoria, a distant suburb of Melbourne. Some hackers have been arrested in the United States, but this doesnt deter Julians ambitions or those of his friends Prime Suspect (Callan McAuliffe) and Trax (Jordan Raskopoulos). Julian, in particular, has set his sights on Milnet, the military network of the US Department of Defense, but a team of Australian Federal Police  led by detective Ken Roberts (Anthony LaPaglia) intend to find him first.

Robert Connelly both wrote and directed Underground. It should be noted that the Subversives hacking exploits in the film are very different from in Dreyfus book and in reality. Assanges personal life and that of his family are almost entirely fictionalized. The police operation did not catch the hackers in the manner of the film. Ken Day, the AFP detective who tracked down Assange and his associates in real life, has criticized the film for claiming that Assange had been in Milnet. Connolly seems to have made Assanges hacking revolve around Milnet in order to create a clear connection to WikiLeaks work in publishing the Afghan and Iraq War Logs. But it is extremely unlikely that Assange was in Milnet, and war revelations were not the purpose of his hacking 20 years ago.

Making a movie about hacking is difficult, because staring at a monitor, wracking ones brain, and waiting, is so boring. I expected the film to include more action and more characters meeting in person than occurred in real life. But the interpersonal relationships don't ring true in the film. The dialogue is silly. Those people were far more interesting in real life. And the strains on their relationships, even the police raids, were more poignant in reality than in the screen version. Worse, by completely fictionalizing the hacks themselves, Underground ignores the real accomplishments of these young people. And by twisting their motives to align them with the 21st century, it shows contempt for the culture and values of the digital underground of the 1980s.

Underground is only saved by its cast. Alex Williams, Anthony LaPaglia, and Rachel Griffiths are charismatic and well-suited to their roles. They keep the audience watching in spite of a poor script populated by a bunch of two-dimensional characters and improbable breaking-and-entering scenes. Underground reminds me of the endless stream of WikiLeaks-themed books that have been rushed to press since 2010: shallow and poorly researched. A better film could be made about a group of bright, idiosyncratic young men obsessed with ideologically motivated and groundbreaking- mischief. But Connelly ignores the culture and the people that hes writing about. And his imagining that Christine Assanges boyfriend belonged to some child-stealing cult borders on defamatory.",1383091200,6,3809,5.299668874172186
5882399,4,B00E0FVZRS,"Really interesting bio type story - I had no opinion on him either way till watching this and now I admire his resolve and pursuit of justice. I was particularly fascinated to find he was initially raised as part of ""the family"" aka ""Children of God"" cult and spent much of his formative years on the run from it with his mother. If you're not familiar with this quite notorious group look it up - a lot of creepy stuff went on. He switched schools several times per year and was also homeschooled often - pretty much a life on the run. FYI - there is a documentary about this group on HBO but it's kinda dreary and leaves off on a negative note.

The story outlines his early years and up until he was initially holed up in the Equadorian embassy in London (and he's still there now, as of July 2016). Check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizenfour/dp/B00VO8D13K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizenfour</a>&nbsp;about Snowden if you're interested in tech whistleblowers/hackers. I actually watched that first and it pricked my interest in Julian Assange, as he attempted to help Snowden get out of Hong Kong and to a country of refuge. I haven't (yet) watched the movie about Snowden - CitizenFour is a documentary - but I will at some point I'm sure.",1468972800,7,1301,4.9953917050691246

5882405,1,B00E0FVZRS,"With documentaries and films like ""We Steal Secrets"" or ""The Fifth Estate"", this inaccurate low-budget film is a waste of time.  It greatly exaggerates Assanges's computer skills and importance as ""hacker"".  One of the first hackers?  He was a baby when the first hackers were at work.  There's a lot of obviously fictional scenes in this film.  His malicious hacking work is justified by a ridiculous claim about finding some criminal American government plan, but there is no proof today because his printer wasn't fast enough to record it?  Pffttt.  It shows him using his computer to black out a city decades before such systems were computerized and networked. The scene with him hacking the police and playing them like puppets is just someone real human hackers can do.  It implies falsely that Assange wrote the WANK virus that attacked NASA during the Galileo launch to Jupiter, but it is known to be written and deployed by two other people, not Assange.  It is telling about Assange that he makes up or encourages grandiose stories like these.",1408233600,,1054,4.909604519774011

5882408,5,B00E0FVZRS,"Excellent adaptation of Mendax's part of the book, with additional background added.

8599726,4,B00E0FVZRS,"This movie of Assange did not fully go into the details of his childhood, did not explain many things one would wonder of his genius, did not even go into his hacking abilities. The movie ended with him being arrested from his so-called crimes at 17 and noted his paternity suit in words across the screen after his arrest . The film is not boring though seemingly incomplete in many aspects . The acting is great.... the story interesting ....and thats about it.
