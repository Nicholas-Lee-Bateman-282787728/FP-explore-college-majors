2159101,4,B00062IDOC,"Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again is a 2004 DVD comedy concert film starring Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy(Tooth Fairy 2). The movie is filled with the boys and their hilarious views on everyday life. The Blue Collar crew and their humour are slightly close to the comedic artistry of Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, D.L. Hughley, and the late Bernie Mac, but they can deliver the laughs when it really counts. Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again is great for those who likes their comedy PG13-rated, which is fine.",1434672000,,558,4.822916666666667

For anyone who has followed any of the guys they will soon realize that their skits are almost the same as the the first tour. Then the guys came out with their own DVD's. So I also rented those. Much to my dismay, the were also the same.  Don't get me wrong though. It is extremely funny, and the guys work great together, but, the material is starting to wear.  When I saw the Blue Collar tour for the first time I nearly peed myself. I thought it was awesome. Then I saw the individuals separately, still funny.

2159139,4,B00062IDOC,"I would rate the stand-up bits in this movie equally high as that icon of a movie that precedes this one (The original Blue Collar Comedy Tour)...it's the interludiums that do not reach the same hights as before. In the orignal, these 'travel-log's were at least as funny as the actual performance...whereas in this one, I find myself looking for the Fast Forward button to get to the actual show faster!

Also less impressive is the singing bit in the end... I kinda liked the ""sittin'around a campfire tellin'stories"" atmosfere of the first shows, and I missed that here.

Nevertheless, for those who have never seen the first movie, this will be an absolute hoot...It was always going to be difficult to reach the lonely hights the first one reached...but it misses that summit only by a fraction... GREAT STUFF!

I , as before, only take away 1 star because of the fact that I had to buy me a whole new DVD-player, just to watch these movies...Is there a reason to believe that european people would not like these?  I hope they will see this Review as a reason to change opinions... Please not just ""area coded 1""!!!",1142294400,,1121,4.618090452261306
2159140,5,B00062IDOC,"Pay no attention to those coastal elitist comedians discussing the quality of airline food (as if the Concorde is going to make a stop at the Lower Appalachian Regional Airport) or sharing anecdotes about waiting ""on line"" at the bagel shop, all the while sniggeringly mocking the moral values of the residents of red states such as my native Virginia. No, here you'll get biting, rip-roaring comedy involving such true-life situations as the food at the Trailways station or being pinned under the tractor for the fourth time in a week. Of special note is Jeff Foxworthy's new ""You might be a patriot if..."" routine, which extolls the virtues of votin', prayin' and bombin' sandy countries.",1130976000,5,691,4.9655172413793105
2159141,5,B00062IDOC,"""Blue Collar Comedy Tour: Rides Again"" is not as funny as it's predecessor

""Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie"" but it's still enjoyable and it has its moments. I thought Bill Engvall's monologue was funnier this time around, the opening scene with them on their bus was pretty damned funny. I didn't think the finale was as good, good...Just not AS good. But, this movie reunites Jeff ""You Might be a Redneck"" Foxworthy, Bill ""Here's Your Sign"" Engvall, Ron ""They Call Me Tater Salad"" White, and Larry the Cable Guy. As I've said in the review for the first movie, some of the things (in my opinion) that make these guys funny is the fact that they look like they're having fun and they make a lot of jokes about stuff that happens. Larry the Cable Guy is kind of your stereotypical stupid southerner, but he's great (ex.

""I was living with this girl for about three months till she found out I was there). Engvall's got endless ""here's your sign"" jokes (ex. ""This year I was on a plane and we hit a deer. I called my wife because this is just the stupidest thing I have ever seen. I said honey we hit a deer. There was silence on the other end of the line and finally she said ""oh my God, were you on the ground?"" I said ""nope, Santa was making one last delivery this year."")

2159143,5,B00062IDOC,"If you liked the first ""Blue Collar"" movie then you will love this one.  With all new material, this movie follows the same format as the original and is once again loaded with laughs.  Ron White, who is quickly becoming my favorite comic, is much more haggard in this one, but still delievers what we've come to expect as Classic Ron.  Get ready to laugh!",1126137600,,356,4.446153846153846
2159144,4,B00062IDOC,"These guys are classic. While the second DVD is almost as funny as the 1st, I did find it dissapointingly crude. I really thought alot of it was unnecessary (hence only the 4 stars). The song at the end is not as good as their first ending, but it still has some really funny moments.

Other than that, it's a great buy.",1123027200,2,320,4.161290322580645
2159145,5,B00062IDOC,"In 2005, the most popular stand-up act barnstorming America is the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again is one of the best DVDs in all of Wal-Mart. This follow-up to the overwhelmingly successful 2003 Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie features the hilarious return of popular comics Ron White, Bill Engvall, Jeff Foxworthy, and Larry The Cable Guy. If this show doesn't make you laugh, then you've got serious problems.

Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again kicks off with the tour bus rolling down a Colorado highway. The four comedy superstars decide to draw numbers from a hat to decide who will go first, second, third, and fourth... Larry The Cable Guy draws seven-and-a-half - but that's the hat size tag!

You'll have to watch this movie for yourself to see in which order the comics perform. But I'll tell you right now that it doesn't really matter. With Larry's ""Git-R-Done"" tagline and ""Lord, I apologize"" warnings, Ron White's liquor induced truth-telling, Bill Engvall's dissection of relationships, and Jeff Foxworthy's classic comedy - you won't find a dull moment. I'd love to provide you with an anecdote (but if I knew the difference between an anecdote and antidote, then my childhood friend would still be alive). So instead, I'll avoid examples and leave the individual jokes for your surprise enjoyment...

However, I will fill you in on the great ending. One of the more hilarious segments of the show is where the four comics gather on stage following their individual performances. In the original Blue Collar Comedy Tour, the men told personal stories. In Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again, Larry The Cable Guy plays (or at least attempts to play) a guitar while each of the men finishes the quotation ""I believe..."" in a song by the same name. It's a funny exchange with some great one-liners, such as ""I believe... that if you can't say something nice, then you must be talking about Hillary Clinton"" (Jeff Foxworthy) and ""I believe... if life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade. Then go find someone who life gave vodka to and have a big-ass party!"" (Ron White)

Just as good as the original (an extremely rare occurrence in movie sequels), Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again is two hours of non-stop laughs, and if you have to ask why, then ""here's your sign""! This is simply one of the funniest DVDs ever made, and that's why it's a definite must-see movie...

The DVD Report",1113782400,,2449,4.821428571428571
2159146,4,B00062IDOC,"I just got this from Amazon a few days ago and have already watched it twice. It's that good; you find new things to laugh at each viewing.

 I have to admit I was bit cautious in ordering this, as Ron White has a tendency to do the same act over and over again (in fact, his THEY CALL ME TATER SALAD DVD is just his act here coupled with his act from the first BLUE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR). This was a bit of a surprise.

 It starts similar to the first BLUE COLLAR DVD, with the boys relaxing. However it's all show after that. I have to admit, i do miss the interludes of the first movie, but I can see how they don't want to beat a dead horse.

 I recommend this one, if you enjoyed the first one. If you didn't, don't look to this to change your mind. Nothing sophisticated here; it's just good ol' boys having fun. And watching them have fun is more fun than being thrown out of a bar in NYC or having your nipple bitten off by a beaver.",1113177600,,939,3.9680851063829787
2159147,3,B00062IDOC,"I did miss the group gatherings that were throughout the first film, because it really allowed us to see where some of the jokes originated and how these friends interact, and honestly, I think it hurt this film.  The friendships were there, it was obvious, but it just didn't come through the television as predominately as the first.  Also, they were all trying new material this outing.  You could tell, because the comfort level was a bit off.  It was as if they were wondering to themselves if the joke would work, or if people were applauding because of who they were not what they were saying.  Maybe this second film was rushed due to the overwhelming popularity of the original, but it wasn't the same.

One keen observation that can be made about this second film was the audience seemed to be whiter collar than redneck.  Half the fun of the original was seeing the audience reacting and laughing at the people that just looked like these comedians were taking a moment of their life and speaking it on stage.  While that may seem mean and morbid, I found that it worked well with the comedians.  A bit of irony if you don't mind, here we have comedians making fun of the people that are laughing at them.  What a strange, continuously circling world we live in.  In this film, the audience seemed more glamorized and you could tell that they were laughing at the people, not so much the jokes.  This can been seen because Foxworthy didn't do any of his patented ""redneck"" jokes, it was as if he modified the joke into the ""married/gay"" routine just for this audience ... as well as what I was saying about new material.

Overall, I thought that this was a decent outing, just not quite containing the same insanity as the first.  I especially did not enjoy the fact that it ended in a very similar fashion as the first.  I just thought that originality and creativity were forgotten about just to capitalize yet again on the popularity of the original.  I wouldn't mind seeing these guys in concert live, but it may make me hesitate for a moment to consider renting another one of their films.  I, sigh, cannot wait to see more of Larry the Cable Guy and with him doing a voice in the next Pixar film Cars, I know that he is going to be the breakout star of the entire endeavor.  If you liked the first film, I don't think it would be unwise to see this film, just be prepared for not as much hilarity as the first provided.

Grade: *** out of *****",1111017600,,2461,4.428888888888889
2159148,5,B00062IDOC,"In The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides again - the comedians Ron White, Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and Jeff Foxworthy are at it again doing their stand-up comedy shtick.  And it is absolutely hilarious.  All four have new material so it's a whole new set of jokes and fun from their previous show.

All four comedians are very funny but Larry the Cable Guy was over the top funny with his exaggerated southern drawl and dumb jokes.  I was laughing so hard I had to rewind the DVD because I kept missing the next joke.

Each comedian was in their usual ""roles"" with Bill Engvall being kind of the everyman, Ron White the alcoholic, cigar puffing derelict, Foxworthy - mostly joking about families and married life, and Larry the Cable guy, the ultimate caricature of a real dumb Southern redneck.

The only disappointing part of the show was that I did not find the encore where the four comedians sit down together to tell jokes very funny.  The encore in the previous DVD (The Blue Collar Comedy Tour) was the best part of the entire show.  Here it's just kind of flat.

Nevertheless, the stand-up comedy acts were great and had me laughing throughout.",1111017600,3,1159,4.587378640776699
2159149,5,B00062IDOC,"This is everything I expected and more. Every comedian on here is histerical with their own distinct brand of comedy. The show starts off with Bill Engvall, my personal favorite. With just one joke he topped his entire set in the first Blue Collar film. That joke was the Dorkfish bit, I had tears in my eyes afterwards. His entire set is equally, if not funnier, than in his own DVDs. Ron White follows with his stand out humor. His humor consists more of sarcasm than outright jokes. His set is over the top and he talks about everything from dead dogs to married life. While there isn't a joke that stands out to me such as Bill's Dorkfish bit, his time was well spent. Everything that comes out of his mouth will make you at least chuckle. The infamous Jeff Foxworthy comes after Ron. He doesn't seem to be up to par with the other comedians or with his older material but it is undeniably funny. His bit about real-life hunting as opposed to TV hunting more than makes up for his less than stellar set. The ever popular Larry The Cable Guy rounds out the solo sets. Larry's set effortlessly suprasses anything he has previously done. He was probably my second favorite of the night. Every joke he told killed and was absolutely hilarious. It was also funny to see him apologizing for what he said after a few jokes. He definitely had a stand out night that night. The most disappointing thing about this DVD is the final part where all the guys get back on stage together and tell some jokes. This part is the only part in the film that fell drastically short of living up to it's predecessor. The first film's ""reunion"" part was arguably the best part, however with this it's the only part I wouldn't mind not watching. One thing missing was Jeff's always funny You Might Be A Redneck jokes. Bill did fit his Here's Your Sign jokes in so that makes up for it in a small portion. Overall this is definitely worthy of the Blue Collar logo. I recommend this to everybody because it's all relateable.",1108425600,2,2002,4.4577656675749315
2159150,3,B00062IDOC,"Although I do intend to blither on a bit, the title really says it all. There were some funny bits, but I found the show in general a bit more crude and in some cases, a bit mean.

For instance, I was wondering during Bill Engvall's routine if there is trouble in his paradise. He was considerably more sarcastic and almost nasty at times when speaking of his wife. He wasn't like that in the first one.

I noticed Jeff Foxworthy had a few zingers for his wife also. Nothing major in his case, still...  He was funny, of course, as was Bill. I didn't think the changes were for the better, though.

Larry had some major misses and some hits. I think he should review tapes of his performances to get a better idea of what works and what doesn't. Very crude occasionally, but still comes across as basically a nice guy. What also keeps coming across is that under that dumb country boy pose, is a man who is probably a college graduate with a masters in Economics or something. The boy definately is not what he seems on surface.

Ron White was disappointing. The main reason I got saw this second one was how hysterical he was in the first. I even bought his DRUNK IN PUBLIC cd. A lot of his material from this DVD was from that cd, with some occasional additions. He was still funny but needs to work on his chronological order when it comes to wives. The new one must not care that he still refers to the ex as his wife. On the surface he appears to be doing well: better clothes, less drinking, cigars instead of cigarettes. Maybe the new wife is having some influence after all. I wish he'd had all new material (my husband said he didn't need new material cuz what he had was still very funny.  You decide.)  but he was still a hoot.  (NOTE: I SAW WHITE IN CONCERT IN 2007 AND HE WAS WONDERFUL! IF YOU GET THE CHANCE, BY ALL MEANS, GO!)

2159156,3,B00062IDOC,"The First Blue Comedy Tour was partially so hilarious because it introduced the redneck-style humor to a mainstream crowd, and because, as another reviewer mentioned, Larry the Cable Guy and Ron White were newcomers no one had seen before. While it was a belly-laughing DVD, truthfully I felt that even the first one got a little old after watching it several times (of course, it's still outstanding, and anything you watch several times will get old).

This new installment just can't match the hype of the previous one. Foxworthy is hilarious but his redneck jokes are sorely missed and he almost appears bitter that he isn't the main header for the show, even though he jokes about not wanting to close the show on the DVD. Big Bill has his moments, but honestly without the ""There's Your Sign"" bits he's pretty lackluster. The biggest disappointment on the DVD is Ron White's bit by far. I loved his sacrastic humor on the first DVD and honestly, besides the Garth Brooks bit, I just couldn't laugh at him this time around. Obviously Larry the Cable guy is the best and he alone redeems much of the DVD.

You'll probably enjoy it the first time through, but I can't see reason for watching it again, and thus, for buying it.",1104796800,2,1229,4.658986175115207

Is it funny?  Sure as heck is!  Bill Engvall had some good funnies.  Ron White came up short in my opinion.  Not as animated and did alot of repeat stuff.  Jeff Foxworthy is never ""not good""!  And the best one?  Who else?  Larry the Cable Guy is about the FUNNIEST comedian I have EVER listened to.  If you want to laugh so hard that tears are running down your face, Larry TCG provides that for you!  I reckon us Southerners relate to much to his material!",1104624000,2,556,4.2

Bill Engvall opens the show this time around. He is a lot better than last time,but still not as funny as the others. Ron White is up next. He is hilarious,probably the 2nd best her,but he should think of some more new bits. Jeff Foxworthy is next. I saw him live last January,so I had heard most of these jokes before. They were still funny. Larry The Cable Guy is last. He REALLY surprised me. I hated his Git-R-Done DVD,and he opened for Foxworthy when I saw him,but he had some HILARIOUS new material. He was EASILY the best. They close the show with some new ""I Believe"" jokes,which are average.",1103932800,,733,4.242857142857143

If anything, the audience (Denver, CO) was more jazzed up for this show which added something to the production. At one point, Bill Engvall begins to crack himself up while improvising, which was funny.

Bill Engvall's - (Here's your sign!) Ironic wit is easy to enjoy and very funny. Among his bits are: DorkFish, Deerhunting with your Wife, Men are Simple Creatures, Pillow Talk

Ron White - (sober or soused?) Ron is dark, sarcastic, and mean. Among his funny bits are: Waiting for the In-Laws to die, Garth Brooks and Camping, and Trolling for a new father-in-law in the retirement home.

Jeff Foxworthy - I find Jeff the funniest of the bunch with a fresh-faced, wide-eyed, good-natured view of the absurd. His material was all new and fresh. His act included some hilarious pieces: Hoo-Hoos are Poisonous, Hunting at Home, Oreo Generation

Larry-The-Cable Guy - Git R Done! I don't care who you are, this is funny. Rude, crude, and socially unacceptable, Larry is the most juvenile of the group. His stories mostly involve his inbred, wild family: his sister, aunt, Grandma, and all the other zanies from double-wide heaven provide ample anecdotes with one-liners cascading one after another.

A lot of fun. Hope you enjoy this performance!",1103846400,40,1360,4.947368421052632
2159161,4,B00062IDOC,"""The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again!""  This is the sequel to ""The Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie"", and like most sequels, at least in my opinion, does not equal the original.  Don't get me wrong, it's funny and worth buying, it just doesn't have the same gut busting affect that the first one does.

This DVD features the same four comedians as the first one, Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Larry the Cable Guy and Ron White.  Contrary to the first one, I found Ron White and Larry the Cable Guy to be the funniest of the four this time around.  It's most likely because I'd heard most of Foxworthy's routine on his newest album so I pretty much knew how his jokes went and Engvall's just didn't seem to have a certain bite to them or something I don't know.

I also wish they would have done some ""You Might Be a Redneck If"" routines and told stories at the end when they all come out together like last time instead of doing the ""I Believe"" song.  All in all pretty good, but not fantastic.",1103587200,18,1000,4.315508021390374

2159164,4,B00062IDOC,"Let's be honest--99% of folks viewing this saw the first one.  My 4-Star review is actually an average divided among two people groups:  1.  Those who ONLY saw the first BCCT and 2. Those who are committed fans who have some (if not all) of the stand-up CDs and individual DVDs for each comic.

Let's deal with Group #1:

If you only saw the first ""film"" and thought it was great, chances are you'll get an overall hoot with this one as well.  It's generally fresh material (although I think anyone would agree the absence of ""real-life"" cut-scenes between acts is a let-down) and the change-up in the order of comics is not a bad thing.  You might not have as many laugh-out loud moments as you had the first time, but let's face it--you hadn't seen half of these guys before you saw the first one.  Part of the gloss of the first DVD is that you're seeing Ron White and Larry the Cable Guy brand new.  Their whole ""gimmick"" is news to you.  Bottom line:  if all you have is the first BCCT to go by, this one won't disappoint.  Worth 5 Stars.

Now to Group #2:

You've watched BCCT countless times, you've TIVOd or ""viddyataped"" Blue Collar TV off the WB, and you've gone to Wal-Mart to buy all the individual comic DVDs, to possibly include buying the ""Git-R-Done"" T-Shirt they sell in Marshall, TX (I've been there recently--I ain't lyin'!).  Now you're waiting for the new ""Blue Collar...Rides Again.""  If you're that dedicated a fan, the new DVD won't do much for you, because you've most likely already heard it.  It's a combination of the individual acts and the ""I Believe"" segments from the TV show.  It's still funny as hell, but it ain't NEW.  It's worth 3, almost 4, stars from me because I love the guys and think they're funny to watch over and over again, but when you're laughing at jokes you've already heard, there's not much 4 or 5 star there, is there?  Worth no less than 3 Stars.

So again, my overall review is 4 stars because I'm averaging the folks who've only seen BCCT and the faithful crew who buy every damn thing that comes out.  Fair enough?",1103068800,13,2072,4.425925925925926
2159165,5,B00062IDOC,"I might be crazy, but I thought this movie was even better than the original.  Larry the Cable guy and Jeff Foxworthy clearly steal the show, and to tell you the truth I do not remember one moment when I was not on the floor dying with laughter.  This movie is a must have for any fan of comedy.",1103068800,3,295,3.983050847457627
2159166,3,B00062IDOC,"After watching, and thoroughly enjoying, the first Blue Collar Comedy Tour, I was expecting big things from their second DVD. Like many sequels, The Blue Collar Comdey Tour Rides Again wasn't nearly as good as the first. In fact my biggest impression was that it was thrown together in order to get it out in time for Holiday Shoppers.

For starters, TBCCTRA is obviously lacking the entertaining scenes, between the stand up bits, which showcased the boys hanging out, going to the mall, etc. In my honest opinion, these scenes, from the original, were every bit as funny as the stand up performances themselves. There is only one such scene at the beginning of TBCCTRA and that is it. Another thing,noticably absent from this DVD, is the extra features and featurettes. There are none.

In addition, the stand up routines themselves, except for Larry The Cable Guy's performance, just aren't as funny. Bill Engvall, known for his witty ""There's your sign,"" bits only has three in his performance and they aren't that funny. Ron White is entertaining but most of his stand up material is not anything new. The majority comes from his ""They Call Me Tater Salad"" DVD. Jeff Foxworthy was pretty funny but I'll echo, what another reviewer stated, about him not seeming to want to be there. His trademark ""You Might Be A Redneck"" bits were noticably absent from his routine. Finally, the finale, which features all four comedians, was brief and only mildly humorous.

I'd recommend skipping this one or just renting it. If you want some real Blue Collar laughs, pick up ""The Original Blue Collar Comedy Tour,"" Ron Whites ""They Call Me Tater Salad,"" and Larry's ""Get R Done,"" instead.",1102982400,4,1679,4.863636363636363
2159167,5,B00062IDOC,"I must say that I am a big fan of the ""Blue Collar"" franchise.  I enjoyed the first movie and like the TV show.  Its a modern ""Hee-Haw"" without musical guests.  Anywho this movie features relatively new bits from the gang.  Ron White repeats

most of his material and has the weakest segment.  Foxworthy looks a bit relaxed, but has some funny moments.  What really makes this one work is Larry the Cable Guy.  I laughed so hard that I cried.  Water was streaming down my face for nearly 30 minutes.  I had to stop the DVD before I wet myself.  He is the funniest comedian outthere.  Envall is pretty good.  His material is new, but does his standby ""Here's Your Sign..."" Still, this is the most enjoyable comedy concert film in years.  If you like the first one, you MUST have this one.

  The real star was Larry the Cable guy. I have heard his CD's and seen him live, which were the same jokes, but this is all new material as far as I can tell. The audience seemed to like him the most. He is really the breakout star.

  Overall, don't expect to be as amused as the first one but I think it is worth $15. They didn't include extras between the acts in this one like the last.
