8174331,5,B000N33LD2,"One of my top 10 surf movies. Occy has that extra natural talent that got him in the rankings. However, he does not have the nature to be a contest surfer, which even makes his achievements more inspiring. Jack Mc Coy did a great job in exposing that side of him - to the point that you feel like you have known him annd relate to him. The cinematography, story line, surfing, comedy and music all work together to make this a top production.",1296777600,,442,4.273809523809524
8174332,4,B000N33LD2,"There is a lot of re-used footage, but the thing I wish is that more of the video was in normal speed.

I don't know why all this super slow motion is the norm!!!

But, if you are a fan of Occy and his surfing, get it.

I guess the proof is in how many times I have watched it.  I have only watched it once, and I have had it for a couple months.

The great videos, you watch again and again.",1189036800,,392,3.674698795180723
