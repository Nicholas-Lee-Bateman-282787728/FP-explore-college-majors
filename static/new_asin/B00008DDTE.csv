7981758,3,B00008DDTE,"This was done in 1998 which looks like Gena Lee Nolin's beautiful home both in the living room & outside w/waterfall & a live tribal band which the camera cuts to at some points in the dance section. The camera, sound, lighting are all professional. Gena is with April Underwood a tribal dance & yoga ""specialist"" & Jackie Potter a pilates instructor & those two lead it with Gena only making a few cute comments or the intro to the workout.
Intro: 2 min
Tribal Dance: 18 min
April leads this & cues YOUR left & right while she & the others move their opposite leg as to mirror you. All African with cuts to the live band & done to tribal music. it was very nice, but also very repetitive, you learn only 6 very easy dance moves, one being like the 1950s dance pony which will burn calories, the others being just pelvic tilts which are easy so that it's hard, easy, heard easy, so you're never overwhelmed.
Yoga Flow: 7 min
April leads here again. A dancy/slightly aerobicized yoga stretching that is not as bad as Denise Austin's style. This is harder to follow as she only reminds you how to stretch, not even to have the front foot bent to a 90 degree angle or have the back foot at a 45 degree angle so that you don't lose your balance doing modified warrior & revolved warrior. some other easy poses like standing fwd bend, tree, plank, down dog are also done.
Yoga/Pilates:
Jackie leads this one, she gives good cues, but gain, only the basics. modified side plank, cat/cow, puppy/plank, sitting single leg stretch/bend back, ab work, etc.
Savasana/Meditation: 2 min
Sitting up, guided meditation

This workout had the right idea, but it's a little too short on instruction & too modified. I liked the tribal music in the dance section, but the yoga & pilates sections had fast piano/nature sounds that was too elevator/corny for me.
The way it's structured, best for light days for those who work out & decent workout for those who don't workout regularly or for beginners. For safety anyone who gets this should know basic yoga & pilates proper form.",1206748800,,2059,4.549865229110512
