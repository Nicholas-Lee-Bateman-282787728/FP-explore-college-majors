8003296,1,B0000UM0OE,"The dvd was received on time and in good shape.  Unfortunately, the dvd would not play in any dvd player. It does have the code 2,4PAL on it which I understand means it is for foreign county viewing.  I would like it return it and get the same movie  but for the USA.  Please send me the address to return the DVD.  Thank you so much for your help.",1275436800,2,348,3.9855072463768115
