8236636,4,B00102F60Q,"This disc is made up of several shows from Liberace's 1950's television series.  The shows were originally shot on film so the picture quality is quite good on this disc in comparison to other early tv shows.  Here you'll see Liberace when he wore a black tuxedo instead of the flamboyant stuff he wore in his later years.  It's fun to see his brother George (who never, never utters a single word) play his violin.  Amazon has this disc at a really bargain price, too.  Check out ""Christmas With Liberace"" (also available from Amazon).  Like this disc, it's a hoot.",1210809600,18,566,4.61
