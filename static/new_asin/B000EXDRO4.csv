2543992,1,B000EXDRO4,"""Savage Journey,"" presented by the Television Corporation of America, is the story of the founding of the Mormon Church, and the trials that Joseph Smith and Brigham Young endured for their faith. While technically in color, the film is really black and gray, and counts as one of the darkest, gloomiest viewing experiences in history: frequently it's difficult to even follow the action and the characters involved. The pacing is turgid and the film is too long by about fifty percent. (How many lynchings do we need to see?)

The early Mormons undergo the humiliation of being tarred and feathered, having their barns burned, being shot, and being insulted by gangs of bigoted idiots. My favorite insult was this sharp barb hurled at Brigham Young: ""Do you think I look like a gorilla?"" I guess the reflexive nature of that bon mot makes it highly offensive and witty, at least in theory. Non-LDS churchgoers are seen to behave in all sorts of unappealing ways: howling like dogs in church was a new one for me.

The Mormons are persecuted in the Midwest, and eventually Brigham Young has a meeting with President Martin Van Buren, who refuses to get involved to stop the harassment of Mormons by local militias. He can't help; it's an election year after all. Joseph gets the townspeople in an uproar by endorsing polygamy, and his wife goes for it in a big way. Joseph founds the town of Nauvoo, Illinois and becomes mayor. When his policies on polygamy are widely derided he makes a proclamation to shut down the paper and destroy the printing press. While the film tries to make Smith look like the victim of big government persecution in this case, there was an obvious freedom of speech issue involved. I'm not endorsing the ultimate fate of Smith as he gets tossed out a jailhouse window by another mob of heathens, but I had difficulty feeling sorry for his plight in this matter given the director's heavy-handed approach. Therein lies the central problem with this film: the ""heroes"" just aren't that heroic, or even likeable.

After Smith dies, Brigham Young sets the Mormon nation on course for Utah. Much of the film is devoted to the hardships intrinsic to taking Conestoga wagons over the Rocky mountains, but it's clear that the Salt Lake area is the promised land. They plant crops (this is a boring little stretch of film), but locusts come in a huge swarm to devour it. After endless closeups of grasshoppers eating foliage, Young prays for divine intervention and a huge flock of seagulls come to eat the locusts. There are other subplots about war with Mexico, about psychic predictions of the Civil War, and about conflict with Native Americans, but frankly they're all tedious and too boring to go into.

For so many dramatic things to happen in a film and have the final product be so relentlessly boring is a statement about both the script and the direction. Some of the acting was modestly strong, and an interesting casting decision definitely enlivened the proceedings: Richard Moll played Joseph Smith. Moll, best known as the not terribly bright ""Bull"" in the television series ""Night Court"" as the fiery polygamist in a hairpiece made apparently from yak fur, provides some unintentional comic relief. He struggles mightily with the role, but the stars didn't really seem to align, and it never really worked.

This is a terrible and terribly made movie, both of which are forgivable sins. What isn't forgivable is the horrifying boringness of the film: ""Savage Journey"" may well seem like the longest 96 minutes of your life.",1222128000,2,3560,4.848684210526316

2543994,1,B000EXDRO4,"The reviews on this movie are full of ignorance and hatred toward the Mormon Church. Let me write your biography, and give it to the world as fact.

2543995,4,B000EXDRO4,"If it weren't for the poor sound and picture quality I would love to rate this movie a 5.
It seems they took this from a VHS tape or an old reel. It would have been better to take it off the Master Reel.

I can't see how they could take time to cover the various doctrines along with the ""Book of Mormon"", the re-editing of the Bible, etc. A little bit on each of the events that was covered seems like a lot squeezed into the little time taken in this movie.

For the time that this movie was made and the money that must have been available I can't see enough wrong to ""pick at"".

""Men to choose from""?
Among them at that time?

The polygamy explanation in the time allowed to cover it was sufficiently covered.",1188950400,,713,4.107913669064748
2543996,1,B000EXDRO4,"This movie supposedly tells the origins of the mormon church. The only reason i watched this movie was that it came as part of a 20 pack western movie set that i picked up from a bargain store. I watched it mainly for curious reasons, Being that i am a christian and i do not agree with anything mormonism teaches and i absolutely do not agree with its  practices. The movie inevitably tries to paint Joseph Smith and Brigham Young as prophets [Something they definitely never were]. What shocks me is that there is almost no mention of the book of mormon [The false ''bible'' that Joseph Smith authored] and there is no mention of how Joseph Smith took the real bible, added and deleted verses from it, and tried to call it the inspired version. Polygamy to me was always a sick, demoralizing thing. The bible clearly states that a man should only have 1 wife. Having more than 1 wife clearly is adultery and it shows that a marriage has no meaning! Another reviewer claims that the mormons didn't allow black priests until 1978. In reality, Mormons didn't allow black people to be mormons period until 1978 [That shows the love of Christ, Doesn't it?]. It is quite maddening when you see the re-creations of people being slaughtered for a man's lies. Brigham Young wasn't innocent neither. After the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham kept the lies of the mormon religion going. As another reviewer said, Brigham forced hundreds of young men into the army to fight a war and it was so that he and his ''leaders'' could have more leaders. Another thing is that this movie doesn't tell about how a man can become a god 1 day [Another bogus theory from the book of mormon] and it stays silent on the circumstances of how Joseph Smith ''found'' the plates on which the book of mormon was started off of. This movie stays silent on many things that're essential to the origins of this false religion, It's almost as if the makers of this movie tried to pass these people off as real christians [Which is something these people were NOT!]. The movie was terrible, The acting was flat, And the inaccurate telling of the story really is a major turnoff. My advice: Watch something else and avoid following the mormon doctrine at all costs.",1188172800,,2229,4.586466165413534
2543997,1,B000EXDRO4,"Savage Journey details how Mormon church founders Brigham Young and Joseph Smith, in the early 1800s, were driven from town to town - and finally out to Utah.

Joseph was the visionary, while Brigham was the solid, sturdy peasant worker. They set up base in Missouri, where they were chased, harassed and finally decided to move to a swamp in Illinois where they would be left alone. They named this area Nauvoo. Peace was still elusive - in this new location they were written about and harassed as well. Joseph destroyed the printing press that was writing against them - and was brought to court. He was killed before the case went before a judge.

In 1846 Brigham brought all of the group out to Salt Lake in Utah, to live in peace there. They began planting - which of course drew in all the crickets in the area for easy food. The native Americans  thought the easy abundance of crickets were a great free blessing of food. The Mormons laughed at this silly idea - while at the same time cursing this ""plague"". They merely tried to squash the bugs. Finally, as tends to happen in nature, birds saw this collection of bugs and gathered for the easy meal. The crops were saved (although the Mormons lost out on a good, nutritious bug stew surplus).

Once they settled in, Brigham pushed polygamy (for men only of course). In 1855 he was quoted as saying ""Now if any of you will deny the plurality of wives, and continue to do so, I promise that you will be damned."" In the movie Brigham claims that this is a way for every woman to ""have a man"". However, how about the 500 young men Brigham sent off to the Army, mostly against their will? Apparently this freed up extra women for the Leaders to take on as ""extras"". It was very disturbing in the movie to see Brigham taking on young teen girls as wives 14 and 15. Also, in the movie it's promoted that Brigham's first ""additional wife"" was a poor widow with kids who needed the home and shelter. In reality, it's more disturbing to see that Joseph - the one who pushed polygamy initially - did it to get his hands on an innocent 17 yr old orphan in 1835. I'm sure the attractive 17 yr old orphan wouldn't have had trouble finding a ""regular husband"" of her own. Note that Joseph only told his wife Emma about his extra wives in 1843 - and she was furious. So much for the constant repetition in the movie of ""the first wife always has say over any additional wives"".

Note that a woman, in Mormon religion, can only be ""saved"" and go to Heaven if her husband is a Mormon. He needs to know her secret name to pull her into Heaven after him.

Ironically, while the movie shows the Mormons as slavery-hating African American friends, in reality they only finally allowed African American priests in 1978. That seems to be quite a different stance.

Now, on to the Native American issues. Salt Lake wasn't a wasteland when the Mormons arrived. Chief Wakara and the Utes lived there. Wakara welcomed the Mormons, figuring they could trade with each other. The Mormons began to take more and more land and trade agreements, and finally a Mormon killed a Ute. Wakara asked for justice; the Mormons refused. Wakara began attacks in retribution. The scene in the movie where Brigham ""saves"" Chief Wakara is a complete invention - in reality Wakara had tried repeatedly to find ways to form a peace and the Mormons had kept encroaching. Finally Wakara decided to just live with it.

The movie only shows two aspects of Native Americans. One is the wild ""unprovoked"" raiders that kill randomly - and the other is the cigar-smoking top hat wearing ""chief"" who depends on Brigham to save him and his people. Neither is very accurate at all. However, it's hard to say the movie was ""down on Indians"". The movie is poorly made in general. There are numerous anachronistic issues. The video quality is very poor and often extremely dark and hard to see. The audio quality is often muddled. There are numerous scene cutting problems where dialogue is clipped or people ""jump"".

None of the bad guys ever have ""reasons"" - it's always the insane, bigoted bad guys (or wild indians) against the quiet, perfectly good ""good guys"". It makes the entire story very unbelievable - you always wonder what the truth of the story is.

I was honestly interested in hearing about how the Mormon church began - but there is no way that I can believe this version. It is more like a high school (or middle school) film project of ""My Way or the Highway"" vs an accurate telling of the story. I highly recommend skipping this one and seeking out other versions of the story.",1153785600,3,4595,4.525301204819277

The 1983 TV movie on the history of the Mormons, SAVAGE JOURNEY is a tale of triumph over many troubles. The only actor I recognized in this was 6' 8"" Richard Moll, aka Bull Shannon on TV's NIGHT COURT. (He has a full head of jet black hair in the film.) Moll played the founder of the Mormons, Joseph Smith. He was murdered by a mob some time before this group left the Midwest for Utah.

Brigham Young, Smith's close friend and successor, had 16 wives and dozens of children in that era before polygamy became illegal by Federal law. The subject is dealt with in a straightforward manner, offering a logical reason for a man having more than one wife, going so far as to claim it was also a blessing for widows and women divorced from abusive husbands.

One example of divine intervention occurs the first year the Mormons began a settlement that would one day be Salt Lake City. Planted crops thrive until millions of locusts attack. With no source of food for hundreds of miles, Young laments in prayer, wondering how the people will survive the coming winter. He asks God for a sign that this plague is not punishment, that there's some hope for the future. Almost like magic, hundreds of gulls appear and they devour the insects. At very least it's some story!

I found this film educational and certainly not a bore yet surprisingly, SAVAGE JOURNEY is only rated 3.9 at IMDb.",1392508800,2,1619,4.65034965034965
8115475,4,B000EXDRO4,"I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a returned missionary and student of Church history. When my granddaughter's other grandma, Faith Cliff Yordan started telling me about having made a movie about Brigham Young, I was hooked. (She played the main female character and her husband wrote the script.) Faith didn't have a copy of the movie, but I finally found one.

  Philip Yordan made good use of the records the Church leaders gave him access to.  There may be too many historical events for some viewers, and perhaps some poor editing, but this film is the most authentic depiction of the early days I've ever seen done by a non-Latter-Day Saint. It tells it like it was. And there is a scene near the end that will really take you by surprise!",1248134400,2,777,4.5285714285714285
