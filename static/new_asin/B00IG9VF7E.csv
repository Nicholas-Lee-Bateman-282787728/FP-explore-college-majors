8641960,5,B00IG9VF7E,"In her heyday I didn't like Kathy Smith; she was a bit too perky and found myself wanting to punch her through the TV if she said ""You got it!"" one more time!  But I gave this one a try because I'm always on the lookout for an intermediate level interval workout, and this DVD really delivers.  With age and experience she has become a lot more low key (she still threw in a few ""You got it's"" but in a reasonable amount).  She lead a delightfully varied class as far as age, sex and exercise level, and they appear to be real people, not certified trainers in perfect condition.  Most importantly is the makeup of the workout.  All the moves start off simply but add on muscles and/or weights so they pretty much all are using your whole body.  Due to the speed at which they are performed they are pretty aerobic, even though they are the ""sculpting"" portion.  She has just a couple a short bursts of pure HIIT-type cardio moves lasting about 30 seconds each, which I felt was sufficient considering how my heart rate stayed raised during the sculpting.  By my calculations, the active part of the workout, including the core work, lasted 45 minutes, ad this was followed by a 10-minute stretch.  Music was what I call ""workout elevator music"", of value only to keep a beat, nothing special.  But overall, I look forward to using this DVD many times again.",1405814400,25,1358,4.483739837398374
