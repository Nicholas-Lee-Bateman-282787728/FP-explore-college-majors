2120906,4,B0002V7NT8,"Hosted by Peter Graves, the 47 minute A&E BIOGRAPHY episode entitled ""The Mystery of Edgar Allan Poe"" first aired in 1994. In its few re-enactments, Edgar is portrayed by lookalike Norman George.

This fast-moving bio partly depicts Poe's life through antique illustrations, etchings, daguerrotypes and book pages, also from modern drawings. His is an unrelentingly sad story.

Abandoned along with two siblings by his actor father (David),  Poe's mother, Elizabeth (""Eliza"") supported her family by appearing in stage productions. She contracted tuberculosis and died at age 24. The three orphans were adopted by John and Rosalie Allen. Mr. Allan was a successful merchant, yet he was stingy and cold toward Edgar.

Young Poe was sent by Allan to the University of Virginia, then a new roughhouse school. He was given only enough money for tuition and travel, which meant a life of great privation. With little food and no cash for clothing or heat, 17-year-old Poe began what would be a lifelong drinking habit. He ran up an immense gambling debt and joined the Army to escape it.

While he was away, Poe's adoptive mother also died from consumption. John Allen enrolled Edgar at West Point but then refused to pay expenses, so Poe got himself expelled. Rallying from this low point, he travelled to NYC and published some poetry. Prior to Edgar becoming a newspaper editor at age 26, John Allan died. He left Poe out of his will.

Our story continues with marriage to a 13-year-old cousin, Virginia and creation of the short stories and poetry that Edgar Poe is still remembered for. Tragically, Virginia would also succumb after a lengthy battle with TB. This was the final straw that pushed Edgar over the edge. He binged on alcohol, bounced from city to city, staying with tolerant friends and may have near the end lost his grip on reality. Poe died in a Baltimore hospital ward after a lingering coma. He was a few months short of his 41st birthday.",1263600000,3,1957,4.879518072289157
2120907,4,B0002V7NT8,Well done video that details the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe. My students enjoyed the video and it enhanced our discussion times about Poe and his poetry. I would recommend this video.,1229385600,4,190,4.617647058823529
2120908,5,B0002V7NT8,"The legend of Edgar Allan Poe is far from the reality, as we learn in A & E's Biography series documentary of his life. The much misunderstood author is given a fair look in this 50 minute overview. They bring us the sad, broken Poe, stumbling through lectures and readings, but they also show us a good man who loved literature and wanted to succeed as a writer.

Any student of Poe has been inundated with macabre, morbid tales of involving dead women, drug abuse and affairs. What is disregarded by early biographers are the facts between the tales. He crafted stories with careful excellence, depending on technique, and not the lack of sobriety. He drew from his personal life, but also fabricated complex fantasies that became the model for Stephen King, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and others. His poetry caught the attention of European greats like Charles Baudelaire and Mihaly Babits, who, in turn, translated Poe's works for the world.

We see where Poe lived an, and hear not only from his literary works, but his letters and the writings of those who knew him. We are able to attain a sense that Poe was not a monster only brooding in his woes, but a family man who longed to remain with Virginia, who lived with, as he wrote in ""Annabel Lee,"" ""no other thought than to love and be loved by me.""

The affect of the tragedies which surrounded him are explored, from his poor relationship with his adoptive father to the many deaths of loved ones, lost to tuberculosis. Many men would have been enfeebled to write, but Poe took his sadness and expressed it as literary art.

I fully recommend ""Biography - Edgar Allan Poe: The Mystery of Edgar Allen Poe (A&E DVD Archives)."" His life has the legendary elements of scandal and addiction, but to know Poe better, it is important to learn beyond the cliches like ""master of the macabre."" This DVD does that.

2120931,5,B0002V7NT8,Excellent biography.  I have always liked Edgar Allen Poe's stories and poems.  I wanted to learn more about his life and his untimely death.,1395964800,,141,4.833333333333333
2120932,5,B0002V7NT8,This DVD biography has a tremendous amount of information about Edgar A. Poe and his life.  I would recommend this for anyone that is teaching his literary work or just a Poe fan themselves.,1395100800,,190,4.588235294117647
2120933,4,B0002V7NT8,"Second year using this video for our 9th grade English class.... We study Poe around Halloween. The biography helps the students to understand how the sadness in his life influenced his writing. In addition, we read ""The Cask of Amontillado"" and then back it up with another product I ordered to reinforce. If they see people giving commentary on his life using research and references, it helps them understand more about his body of work. It also aides in teaching  Common Core  English standards, where they must learn to support their research with evidence.",1382745600,,562,4.968085106382978
2120934,5,B0002V7NT8,"This is a great video, well-done and informative. Today's young students have a difficult time connecting with the work of the authors who lived ""way back then,"" as they put it.

The students seem to lose the idea that there is a person behind the literary work, a person with specific life experiences that shaped the writing. And that's what makes it hard to connect to the work itself for many of these students.

This video bridges this gap between the person and his work and, thus, between today's students and Edgar Allan Poe. The story of Poe's life told in this biography makes him much more real to the students.

I definitely noticed a positive difference in their interpretation of his work after we saw this film. Their essays became more honest, more sincere, and more engaged with the texts. Highly recommended!",1377648000,2,826,4.7622377622377625
2120935,5,B0002V7NT8,"Educational.  Interesting.  I liked it, but most people would probably find it boring.  If you like Poe and you like documentaries, you'll like this.",1356566400,,149,5.125
2120936,5,B0002V7NT8,I used this as an introduction to his life and works. It was engaging and enlightening. A terrific introductory resource to use before you launch into Poe.,1346976000,,155,4.777777777777778
2120937,4,B0002V7NT8,Very interesting and informative! It allowed me to think of more questions that were not always answered in film. It would have been better if it were an actual movie.,1336435200,,167,4.6

8032201,5,B0002V7NT8,I had purchased this A & E production prior to the current one and did so now to obtain a DVD of it.  A late friend of mine got his SAG card by appearing as Mr. Poe in this rendering.  Mr. Norman George's physical presence is limited but it is in the audio - when you hear the dialogue/the spoken words as that of Poe with his melodious/musically southern accented voice that conjures up the essence of the man.  It is a rare treat as it has the ability of one witnessing the nineteenth century and most importantly the life of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe.,1524614400,,548,4.2

8032206,1,B0002V7NT8,"To begin with, no one planning to do a biographical documentary on Edgar Allan Poe can hope to do him justice in 50 minutes. But then to include extensive readings from his stories and poems by an actor who sounds like a cross between Truman Capote and a Beat poet from the 50's is intolerable. I have rarely heard worse readings in a professional program. Save your money and hope that PBS will do a proper American Masters tribute to Poe in the future.",1472601600,2,454,4.416666666666667
