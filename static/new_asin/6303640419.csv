693328,4,6303640419,"I remember watching this movie along time ago and I didn't see it all the way through, but I do remember the guy going to the van at the gas station because he saw the van shaking, and he peers inside, and ...Boo! jump out of my seat! This is a demonic tale of a creature who has been on Earth since ....well...the creation of the Earth. It wants to be reborn as a human, so it crawls up a woman and becomes her fetal baby. Pretty sadistic and evil; the woman has conversations with the child, who speaks already inside the womb. I guess there's an underlying message here that men are evil and that they have been this way since the beginning of man...but that's just me.
I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes gory horror.
P.S.-I got this VHS before I found out about the Baby Blood (the original title) DVD, so I might get the DVD because I think it features some graphic gory footage that is missing from my VHS copy.",1185408000,,927,4.242937853107344
693329,2,6303640419,"""Baby Blood"" starts out promising, reminding me somewhat of ""Freaks"" with its circus setting. It seems that some sort of parasitic creature has infected one of the circus animals. It eventually breaks out, invades a woman and then she goes on a killing spree to ""feed"" her host baby. There is a fair amount of blood spurting and nudity but not much else. The film depicts the communication between the woman and her parasitic invader and this voice over stuff never really works. It is basically a road trip story with the woman moving from place to place and then killing someone. One thing that I found amusing is that there is a lengthy period towards the end of the film where the woman is covered in blood. No one seems to really care or even ask if she is okay, they treat her requsts for a ride as if she looked otherwise normal. You would think that if someone walked up to you covered in blood you would at least take notice. Really not much in this film worth a purchase, no special features of note, rental only.",1177113600,,1023,4.417989417989418
693330,4,6303640419,"I lived the first fourteen years of my life in Austria and so I was often present within European video stores. I picked this box up with a friend and marveled at the vile cover art(the version that I picked up, depicted the mother holding a monstrous baby drenched in gore) and new that we had found a winner for the night.
Baby Blood, as I knew it, was and still remains, one of the most facinatingly grotesque and visceral movies that I have ever seen. I found the idea to be truely terrifying (aliens meets rosemarys baby).
Finding an uncut version here in the states could prove to be somewhat of a challenge, however if you are a gorehound, I declare this struggle, highly worth your time and effort.
This is not your average splatter flick.",1059609600,4,747,4.45985401459854
693331,3,6303640419,"After the success of Rosemary's Baby, they decided to do a sequel involving the manhood of the baby, entitled Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby. It bombed so bad they had to do a third, where it shows the process of how the baby comes to be. The actual ""baby"" comes from hell and possesses the normal baby. This has to do with the daughter of Rosemary's Baby, for he was seduced by a woman named Yanka in the second one. By the way, I wonder if the baby thought it was from the ocean because of the salt water in the womb. All I know is that I own the Rosemary's Baby trilogy, and this is far superior to the awful second one. Highly recommended.",1056758400,2,652,4.182539682539683
693332,3,6303640419,"This isn't the greatest horror flick I've ever seen but is definitely above average and has a suprisingly good amount of gore. The movie begins by showing you a beast that has been captured in the African jungle. This beast, a jaguar, is particularly fierce...as if something is inside of it and making it so. It arrives at a circus where are leading female character lives with her abusive, circus manager boyfriend. The mere sight of the creature causes the other animals to get ancy and aggressive. Later that night, the manager wakes up, leaves his sleeping girlfriend and wanders about the circus. He finds the animal tamer weeping in front of the jaguar's cage as the beast is splattered about the cage (as if something emerged from within). Something did and it finds its way to the sleeping woman and creeps up into her womb. From this point on the movie follows her and the evil within her, which by the way can communicate with her. It needs blood to grow and drives her to seduce and kill as many people as she can in order to nourish they creature within her womb. The movie culminates with the birth of the creature and from there...things can only get bloodier as the abmonination emerges from its newborn skin and slithers onto a bus full of futbol players. This is a pretty simple plot and it is presented in a very easy to follow fashion. The female lead is attractive in a euro sort of way and the dialogue between her and the creature in her womb pretty much carries the film between the violence. The scenes of gore are suprisingly good, especially a scene towards the end that takes place in a ambulance. It's not the greatest thing to come out in recent years...",999302400,3,1684,4.542763157894737
693333,5,6303640419,"This is a great vid to watch if you are a fan of camp and gore.  The acting is decent, the plot is easy to understand and interesting, and an above average amount of blood and goofiness, but blended into an eerie atmosphere of realism.  Turn the light off and get ready for the EVIL WITHIN...",972345600,3,292,4.196428571428571
693334,1,6303640419,"I was VERY disappointed in this movie.  The cover made this movie look like it would be very interesting and suspensful, but I couldn't even make it through the whole movie before turning it off.  The beginning is SO  confusing and goes absolutly NOWHERE.  I would not recommend this movie.",961113600,,290,4.74
7851839,2,6303640419,"Wow what a let down. If you are thinking of paying $30 or more for DVD of this thing, do yourself a favor and forget it.

There's plenty of blood and some stabbings and some female skin. But this thing is drawn out, monotonous and you don't even see the creature till the last 5 mins or so. Then the ending makes no sense.

Really really not very good, you are not missing anything. Some friends and I actually started dozing during parts of it waiting for something interesting to happen.",1524873600,,489,4.362637362637362
7851840,4,6303640419,I remember seeing this movie when I was 12..I was wide awake watching cinemax and bit was 3am on Halloween.  And it was extremely bizarre for a 12 yr old and still is a bit for me now at the age of 36. Well made and the gore and violence is awesome. I love classic Euro horror films.,1511395200,,283,3.8793103448275863
7851841,5,6303640419,"Parasites hijacking vaginas, what's not to love? This one has a storyline that will spin your head, lots of blood spray and gore, and a fair amount of comedy strewn about it as well. Emmanuelle Escourrou's young and buxom frame is sans clothing for a bit of the film, which is incentive for the eyes if nothing more. Original, fun, messy. Not for the kids.",1503619200,,356,4.492307692307692

7851843,5,6303640419,"This is a truly amazing horror gem, made in 1989 and released in 1990 its about a demon that wants to be re-born and takes host in a pregnant woman's baby and needs her to kill for the blood it needs to survive, amazing gore and bloodshed, fantastic lead actress who also has some great nude scenes, the voice of the creature is extremely creepy as it speaks to her and tells her about how and why he must be born, the whole film is so unique and must be seen to be believed, a classic gem of film, worth every penny!!",1391990400,2,518,4.088235294117647

7851845,4,6303640419,"Baby Blood is a weird little French horror film but very effective. It starts out with a Creature from the Black Lagoon beginning explaining the origin of the monster from the beginning of the creation of earth. The creature enters the womb of a well built circus owners wife who is treated abusively by him.  He is extremely possessive so when she disscovers she is mysterously pregnant she flees. The creature keeps talking to the host and you hear the conversations as she goes between thoughts of sucide and mothers  love for the alien inside her body. The creature in the womb needs blood to survive so many bloody murders follow as the mother and creature head to the sea where the creature says he must live. There is nudity,much blood and a crazy story.everything modern horror fans will love. I highly recommend theis movie.",1247097600,,833,4.7379310344827585
7851846,4,6303640419,"It's sad how much the English version is edited. The only uncut version on this disk is the French version. You wouldn't know it by the English language version, but this is almost a horror comedy!",1240272000,2,197,4.5
7851847,4,6303640419,"Baby Blood (also known as The Evil Within) tells the story of a woman who is impregnated with an ancient entity... that craves blood for sustenance and eventual birth.  This is a French horror film by director Alain Roback (unfortuantely never did anything else worth note) that Anchor Bay has deservingly exhumed and released featuring everything intact and completely uncut (kinda like what they did with the Deep Red DVD, some lost footage has subtitles).  This is less a horror film than an exploitation picture but it provides more than enough uncomfortable (especially if you are female I would guess) and macabre scenes to keep you entertained.  The scenes of gore and violence are extreme while remaining really well-done, almost like mixing the over the top stylings of Dead Alive with the surrealism of Cemetary Man (and who doesn't love both those movies?)in a really grimey pot.  Yanka, our female lead spends a good portion of the first quarter of the film either scantilly clad or completely full-frontal nude and although not that attractive (Mike Strahan type gap in teeth, frizzy hair, black circles under eyes) I was in need of a cold shower by the time the credits rolled.  All in all a very entertaining and original movie, that although may be nothing more than exploitative sleaze... remains really, really good exploitative sleaze!",1192752000,3,1354,5.026785714285714
7851848,3,6303640419,"Baby Blood (Alain Robak, 1990)

I started feeling a lot better about Baby Blood once I realized it was supposed to be a comedy. At least, I think it was supposed to be a comedy. They couldn't have intended some of those scenes seriously, could they?

The film concerns Yanka (Emmanuelle Escourrou), a rather lovely young carny who becomes impregnated by, well, something. Dissatisfied with her carnival life, and under the command of the thing now growing inside her, she leaves the carnival and sets off on a killing spree to get blood to feed the creature.

Yeah, that's pretty much the entire plot. Still, despite the thinness of the plot and the obvious fact that Robak treated this as pretty much a straight exploitation film (it's right up Joe Bob Briggs' alley), there's something under the hood here, whether it's the film's warped sense of humor (one of the best scenes involves Yanka hijacking a bloodmobile) or the fact that there's actually character development, or Robak's approach to stereotypes (Richard the womanizer could easily drive a film of his own), this didn't come off as just-another-blood-breasts-and-beasts flick. I grant you, it doesn't come off as a deathless piece of filmmaking, either, but it's not a mindless action-horror film, either. If you're a fan of the outer edges of the horror genre, this is definitely one you should consider hunting down. ***",1185926400,,1387,4.969827586206897
