Robson Green  is super-sexy as the lovelorn doctor who falls for his bosses wife. Michael Kitchen as the husband and Francesca Annis as the wife are utterly believable. When you add in all the other character studies here, Robson's doctor friends, his working class dad et al you have a soap opera story but with superb acting and a whip-smart script. This is perfect escapism for the romantic.
Also in the set is Anna Karenina. This is a wonderful version of the Tolstoy classic that I never even knew about. A real bonus. The weak link is Wuthering Heights. I never got beyond 15 minutes in. It's a dreadful version.
Anyhow, Reckless and Anna still make this set worth buying. It's cheaper to get both together than separately and they are well worth owning.",1347753600,,934,4.461988304093567
8075604,5,B000A7DW9O,"I am a big romantic and I love Victorian dramas - Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Little Women, etc.
I came across this collection and could not resist buying a collection of 3 of these tales:

- Anna Karenina
- Wuthering Heights
- Reckless

I found this a good buy and a great addition to my DVD collection.",1345766400,4,303,4.298245614035087
