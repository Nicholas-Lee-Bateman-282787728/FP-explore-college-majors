3111312,3,B0013I97S4,If you like endure bike racing then this might be something you might like to try out. Would have liked it to be in HD.,1371945600,,119,3.8
3111313,5,B0013I97S4,This is a great movie for enduro fans. What David Knight can do on a dirt bike is nothing short of amazing. The pacing of the film is excellent and Charlie Boorman does a great job at narration.,1370736000,,194,4.131578947368421
3111314,5,B0013I97S4,"The racing in this film is excellent. The beginning has a good pace to it, though the film slows down in the second half. Still, this is a great movie if you enjoy amazing riding.",1369094400,,179,4.142857142857143
3111315,5,B0013I97S4,"I had never known of David Knight, but now do.
This film shows his history to getting into racing and what he can do.
Would expect anyone that likes motocross to like film.
It was a bit hard to understand his accent from Man of Isle.",1367452800,,233,4.086956521739131
3111316,5,B0013I97S4,David Knight is a Fantastic Rider.  Shows him going through some tough terrain.  Also shows his personality and he seems to be a good guy.,1367193600,,138,4.48

3111318,4,B0013I97S4,"It's obviously very hard to record enduros- 100 miles of woods needs a lot of cameras.  Still, there is an awful lot of padding and interviews.  More riding would have been nice, although Knighter is a real charmer on camera.  Also, more info on the bike setup and his riding technique would be helpful

If you want a truly excellent bike movie, get Team Extreme's 1985 Manx GP movie.  True, it's road racing, but they assume you're already into bikes and treat the viewer like any other aspiring rider.

Still, a good movie.  Glad I got it.  Very exciting.

Its Mr. Knight, who at 6'4"" or something, hunched over his 525 like its a mini bike, going at insane speeds.
