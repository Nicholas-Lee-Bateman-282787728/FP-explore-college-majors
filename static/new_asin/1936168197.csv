8257463,5,1936168197,"Loved the Movie,BUT what I didn't like was the TWENTY+ extra Dollars I had to pay to collect it from the post office. The DVD was already VERY expensive aswell as the normal shipping costs. So to then have to pay even more,pushed the price Way up to almost SIXTY Pounds. Not worth it by any stretch. So from now on I will NEVER use U.S. Amazon again.",1350604800,3,350,4.161764705882353
