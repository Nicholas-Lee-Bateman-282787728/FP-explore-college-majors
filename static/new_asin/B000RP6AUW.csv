Keep Ya Head Up isn't on here like it says on the case. Brenda's Got A Baby, 2 of Amerikaz Most, Changes and all the THUGLIFE videos are left out of this DVD. I'm glad a less popular video like Wussup With Tha Luv, Made Figgaz Papa'z Song is on here, but it doesn't make up for the classic videos. But over, since its Pac, I'll enjoy it no matter what.

PS (1)
Why was there a non-related reggae video at the end of the DVD?

and also, I notice who ever made this DVD tried to be slick and added the XXX version of How Do You Want It in the review of the video at the end of the DVD as well",1190592000,2,744,3.888157894736842
8202092,3,B000RP6AUW,"The music volume goes up and down on certain videos and the quality of the music videos feels like a VHS copy to DVD.  You have HALF of every 2Pac music videos, but not ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" and ""2 of Americaz Most Wanted"".  Beware that this DVD also has advertasment for Iwanttobeontop.com an 1-800 # in every freakin video.  The editing going to one video to the next was done so poorly, you almost want to stop watching it.  Overall...this DVD gets three stars because its 2Pac, but the quality and editing and the way they organized the songs was low entertainment!  Only buy this if your a true fan or you just want to add it to your collection.",1190160000,,650,4.338842975206612
