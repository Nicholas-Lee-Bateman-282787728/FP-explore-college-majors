1418938,4,B00005ATQJ,"The image of Jack Nicholson's head peering through the chopped hole in the bathroom door screaming, ""Here's Johnny!"" is one that remains in the mind long after it is first seen. That is the case with Stanley Kubrick's film version of Stephen King's ""The Shining,"" a chilling tale of a hotel with a dark past, and the inhabitants it wishes to claim for its own. The movie does borrow from the plot of the novel, but sensationalism takes over and changes a lot of the novel's story. Still, on the basis of its own development, as well as the actors portrayal of the characters, the movie works very well, and delivers chills and suspense Kubrick-style.
Jack Torrance seems to be down on his luck until he is offered a job taking care of the expensive and illustrious Overlook Hotel in the mountains of Colorado. He sees it as the perfect opportunity to finish the writing of his play, while also making some money doing house chores for the owners, and jumps at the chance to take the job, ignoring the stories of past caretakers who never quite make it through the entire period without going insane. Meanwhile, back at his home, his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, anxiously await any good news, although Danny already knows that his father got the job. He is told by his friend, Tony, who seems to be an imaginary childhood playmate but may play a much larger role than first assumed.
They arrive at the hotel as the last of the winter preparations are being made, and soon, it is just the three of them, left to do nothing but wander around in the vast expanse that is the Overlook. Kubrick brings a nice touch of the overpowering to this aspect of the film. His sets are ominous, large, and tower over the three inhabitants like pillars to some unknown realm, providing the perfect atmosphere for the cabin fever that seems to be plaguing Jack as the movie progresses. His attitude towards his wife begins to change, and he becomes more hostile and cold. What's more, he is seeing ghosts, who offer him alcohol and all the comforts of home, welcoming him and convincing him to invite his family to join the party as well.
The movie is, without a doubt, a classic, because, despite its flaws, it is able to incite fear in the audience. Much of the time, before something shocking is about to happen, Kubrick sets up the moment with a long period of silence and then hits us with the intended shock or scare. His sense of style and the non-stop movement of the camera in certain scenes gives the movie an unsettling appearance, that nothing is what it seems, and that something is always lurking in the shadows, waiting to disturb the happy family.
The real scares come from the performance of Jack Nicholson, whose portrayal of Jack Torrance is matsterful and ultra-creepy. He already has the look of a psychotic from the very beginning of the movie, and this helps give that added eeriness about his character when the time comes for him to advance from sane to going over the edge. Torrance goes beserk on his family, taunting his wife psychologically with her own fears and doubts about her son and her husband, as well as chasing the both of them with an ax as they try to escape him.
There are incredible amounts of tension in scenes such as those mentioned above. The bathroom scene, as well as the scene in which Wendy gets a first-hand look at Jack's finished play, are the key scenes that move us to fright. The music adds a lot in making the suspense work, sometimes playing low and mysterious to underline the tension, or playing high key notes and unsteady strings to indicate intensity and fear. All of this combines to keep the movie frightening and classic, remaining in our minds long after the final chilling sequence.
The only put-off for this movie is that it strays from the original focus of the novel, and that is the power that Danny possesses to see things as well as stop things from happening. In the novel, Danny and his father connect with one another psychologically in the end through his power, and they use that power to end the terror of the ghosts and apparitions. In this version, the focus of the story is Jack's descent into madness, and while it is nice to watch and works on its own, it does not do the book justice. Also, Danny is able to sense things with the help of his friend, Tony, who is merely a figure of his imagination in the novel. In the movie, Tony comes in the form of Danny's index finger, accompanied by a semi-Satanic voice from Danny, which makes us want to laugh and cringe rather than be frightened. Other small factors, such as Halloran's murder and events surrounding Room 237 (217 in the novel), are among the things that the movie changes.
The performances here give us a unique brand of chills and believability. Nicholson, as stated above, is brilliant as Jack Torrance. Shelly Duval is equally excellent as Wendy Torrance. Where Jack inspires the fear, she is there to receive it, her trembling hands and quivering lips the perfect adornment for a woman his is lost in her fright. Danny Lloyd plays Danny, who doesn't have as impacting a role in this film as the novel gives his character, but he does what he can, and does it well.
Even though it does not stick directly to its source material, ""The Shining"" is a horror classic because it is able to scare us time and again. Its sense of style, vision and grandeur are all employed by Kubrick to give us a chilling story that is heavily laden with slow building suspense and intensity that amounts to a surprisingly effective experience.",985651200,9,5555,4.578313253012048

1418946,5,B00005ATQJ,"The Shining is one of only sixteen films directed by Stanley Kubrick. Others include: A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Spartacus, and Lolita. Each one is different and stands out on its own.

The Shining takes place in a remote hotel left to a family to take care of over the winter.  The family includes a husband and wife played by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall.  The husband goes mad, hallucinates, and tries to kill the wife. Who better to play a crazed writer yielding an axe than Jack Nicholson. My favorite scene is a chase through an outdoor maze at night. After 35 years, you can still feel the tension.

The Shining was filmed at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Colorado. I used to pass it on my way to Rocky National Park, the location of Long's Peak. It is a beautiful place where people go for their weddings, not for horror spectaculars.",1438128000,,848,4.522875816993464

I understand Stephen King stayed at the Stanley Hotel and the spirits encouraged him to write the story. However I've seen those films and I must say, the Kubick version is the best.

1418965,4,B00005ATQJ,"The film was shot in a large vacated beautiful vacation  get-away hotel  that is  humming  with people during the warm  summer months.  When winter comes, no one wants to  stay there so far away from everything and especially in the winter when snow and icey winds  swirll in. Nicholson and his wife stay there  to keep the place  going thru the winter. It is perfect and quiet for a writer to  concentrate when writng a story. Except  they start seeing things  when a blizzard hits, cutting off their phone and  short wave radio contact with the  outside world. The seemingly going mad writer  is Nicholson's very best performance..so I believe.  A great horror show in color that features the ball room scene with Nicholson among the dancing crowd at the bar talking to the bartender .Is he rerally there?

1418967,5,B00005ATQJ,"THE SHINING.  Originally, a novel, by ""horror"" writer, Stephen King, THE SHINING may be the only example of a movie being better than a book it's based on, if it's not an original screenplay.  I've seen many versions of books I've read or would read later and in all these cases, the book is invariably better: it's easy: there's more space, more things that one gets from reading the book that don't get addressed in the film or might be, but may be expressed with symbolism or allusions.  But, THE SHINING was made by Stanley Kubrick, who had recently made spine-tingling brilliant films from novels (A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, by Anthony Burgess and 2001:  A SPACE ODYSSEY, by Arthur C. Clarke), was to be HIS movie; so much so that he even added in a couple extra things that weren't in the original book; the full-sized Labyrinth, made out of shrubbery, isn't in the book, but is used in the film as almost a character in itself, with all it's twists and turns.  This is so well-made; there are so many things going on at certain times, but everything was carefully by Kubrick.  It is one of those films that one, just as with his other films, can watch over and over again, they're all so dazzling and also because, sometimes, the more you watch, the more you pick up - a certain prop or phrase that you didn't pay attention to before suddenly takes on significance to you, regarding something in the movie,  There are even people who really obsess over this film-if you ever see the documentary ROOM 237, you'll see what I'm talking about - people think the film's underlying message is the horror of the Nazis and the Holocaust; others brought up imagery that, instead, pointed to an underlying message of the extermination of Native Americans.  What made me really brush it aside was when one guy (we don't see his face, unfortunately-no one who speaks in here is shown, it's weird that way, huh?) started to on and on about how Kubrick was working for NASA and/or the Air Force, etc, and his ""mission"" was to use his filmmaking skills to ""shoot"" the moon landing and all subsequent films that we've all seen and all think it was ""really filmed on the moon"" when, in fact, this guy goes on to say, ""I'm not saying they didn't actually go to the moon, yeah, they went there, but they couldn't run the camera once on the moon..."" then went on to talk about how Stanley Kubrick had been a big part of the making of these rigged films of ""the moon"", meant to show the world, pictures of what the moon looks like, etc (I don't know how that iconic ""earth rising"" photo could've been faked, since you'd have to have seen it, been there  and seen it and you couldn't reproduce something like that, not back then, at least) and so this crazy guy is going on about all the little clues Kubrick's placed throughout the movie that make  supposed references to this ""moon landing staging"" that he'd done, some bordering on the absurd.  That was it, after this guy's rambling, insane references to staged moon-surface films that were filmed on a set in Hollywood, by Stanley Kubrick, I completely lost interest in this ROOM 237, ""mockumentary"" and barely paid any attention to the rest of it.  But, however, it did give me a renewed interest in THE SHINING, itself, the film.  I can't wait to get it and see it againl  It's been a long time since I've seen this movie soon I'll have the DVD.",1387756800,2,3380,4.51063829787234

1418987,5,B00005ATQJ,"I never really considered this movie to be a true 'horror' film. I guess it never really scared me.

1418989,5,B00005ATQJ,"This movie is one of the best films ever made that is based on a Stephen King book.  Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) takes a job as the caretaker of a hotel/resort high in the Rocky Mountains.  He takes his wife Wendy (Shelley Duval) and his young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) with him and they will be isolated for the entire winter as the place is literally snowed in for months.  It is an undemanding job as there really is not a lot to do and they get free room and board for the entire stay.  Jack is going to use the time to write a book he has in mind.

Danny is a special child as he has telepathy and premonitions of the future.  He is shocked when the hotel's cook who is giving them their introductory tour speaks to him telepathically.  The cook (Scatman Crothers) has his ability from his grandmother and that she called it the shining.  He tells Danny that he has it also.  Danny tells him that the hotel is scary and that it has its own shine.  He tells Danny to be careful and to stay out of room 237.

A major winter snow storm hits and now they are truly isolated.  Unfortunately the hotel has an evil history and evil spirits abound there.  Jack is slowly driven crazy and possessed by the former caretaker that murdered his family.......

This movie and book is just downright scary and creepy.  There are some scenes in the movie that are very graphic and macabre. I love horror stories and movies and this one is just outstanding.  It is really a classic Stephen King story that was transformed to the movie screen with a wonderful cast and great directing.  I recommend it to you.",1343433600,3,1597,4.341216216216216

[1.] TRY to watch the opening (credit) sequence and keep telling yourself the obvious thing: ""O.k., he did this with a helicopter and a Steadicam ... o.k., he did this with a helicopter and a Steadicam ... o.k., he did this ... uh ... um ... um ... WHOA!"" [Talk about an EYE in the SKY!  Spooky, creepy, and unnerving -- and this is the point the film STARTS from!]
[2.] Colorado becomes a ""lost zone"" right here in the good ol' Continental U.S.; Kubrick mentioned (someplace) the intriguing irony of Danny & Dick Hallorann having this ""ESP"" wavelength they can ""tune in"" on, but, nonetheless, it only can only do them so much good, given all the other obstacles in place, given the isolation of the Hotel Overlook ... I mean, sheesh!  Talk about feeling lost in your own backyard!  A part of America that can loom like a ""lost continent""?  Who'da thunk it?
[3.] The scene where Wendy unknowingly ""interrupts"" Jack at his writing and he ""patiently"" explains to her how his concentration is ""gone"" is, in a sense, the most terrifying moment in the film for me (or, perhaps, the most ""pivotally"" terrifying moment in the film).  I mean, what ... he's supposed to replicate ALL THE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES that brought him there, over again, to get ""started"" again?  How's he's supposed to do THAT?  (And: he's ""blaming"" HER for that?  Oh dear ... this can't go anywhere good ...)
[4.] The scene where Wendy only somewhat-confidently recounts Jack's history (and, by extension, hers with Jack) doesn't really resonate so much at the time, until, much later, when, in retrospect, it seems like: OH GEEZ ... she didn't really know what she was getting into, at ALL!

1418992,4,B00005ATQJ,"THE SHINING

Perhaps the most difficult of all these reviews is this one.  The Shining is not in any way an ordinary horror movie and it has a lot of room for interpretation.  At a little over two hours, it's a lengthy movie in a genre that usually emphasizes promptness.  But it is all worth it, for director Stanley Kubrick jams a ton of information into this film with a great end result.

The plot can be summed up quite easily.  A family is hired by the Overlook Hotel to watch the place during the off-season in the winter.  The husband Jack has a history of violence and alcohol abuse, and his son Danny has what appear to be psychic abilities.  As the winter progresses, Jack looses his mental stability, Danny sees horrific visions of death, and wife Wendy tries to hold her family together.  This culminates with Jack experiencing total mental breakdown and attempting to kill his family.

It would be typical if not for the fantastic story that is woven into this simple plot.  Jack's break is slow and deliberate.  There are strong insinuations that the hotel is seriously haunted and that the spirits that lie within have taken hold of Jack's mind.  Or it could be the stress of the winter that has caused his violent tenancies to reemerge.  There are lots of events that can sway you either way, so it's hard to tell.  This goes equally for many of the ghostly occurrences in the film.  You're never sure what is real, what isn't or who these apparitions are.

What these supernatural events are is irrelevant.  What is important is that they establish an unsettling mood.  At no point do you ever feel like there is a spot in the hotel that is safe from these visitors.  Every corner, every room has the potential for ghostly happenings, especially considering that its just the three living souls in the place.  The isolation is unbearable at times and just the thought of being trapped in this building all winter long is frightening enough.  Even more frightening is the concept of being unable to escape these demons who lurk about.  It's like being a rat trapped in a snakes cage.

The acting is spectacular.  Jack Nicholson is nuts in this role.  Of less regard I feel is the credit due to the Overlook itself.  In a strange way, the hotel is an actor.  The film wouldn't have been half as good if not for this place.  It suits the story perfectly with its maze-like floor plan, cavernous rooms and hallways, and overall engaging architecture.

Kubrick put a great deal of thoughtful work into this film, and it deserves to be examined.  Every shot, every scene is well thought out and the result is a film that doesn't ever go overboard, but also gives you enough information to get its point across.  Where is seems to stop is at that place of complete understanding.  The movie will advance an idea, but stop before giving out enough information to draw a conclusion.  Some people may find this frustrating, but I think it makes it all the more creepy.  We'll never know the truth about what was going on at the Overlook and this heightens the effect.

I think a lot of people shun The Shining because of its length and slow pacing.  Fact is, the movie slowly builds to its fantastic ending because it wouldn't have worked any other way.  If Jack just started going crazy after the first 30 minutes, it would have failed.  Kubrick builds a steady and consistent anxiety with every small detail and event rather than diving head first into blood and gore.  Every bit he gives us we add to an already rising tension about what is going to happen next, until of coarse Jack flips entirely.

The Shining will be sure to entertain, but it is also thought provoking.  Pay attention to the details, think about the scenes.  It's the kind of movie that has a lot going on in the background and this will allow you to draw your own conclusions as to what this movie is trying to say and just what it all means.",1318982400,2,3925,4.531339031339031

The film is two and half hours long and the pace is not pretty rapid, things start out slow but the tension build and the exotic, thrilling atmosphere is created successfully, such that the characters make your eyes get glued to the screen completely and you find yourself holding your breath to observe their consequences. The film may not be perfect and leave you wanting for more, but the strong performances really make up for tiny flaws. A really good film for a Friday Night, if you are ready for neat and a genuine thrilling experience. Worth watching!",1294358400,,678,4.904347826086957

For along time I could not watch the twin girls without covering my eyes so I could only see them for a couple of seconds. They are also very creepy too and also when Wendy dicovers whats actually in Jack's writing, this part just blew me away with creepy terror and I could not believe what was written there page after page.

1418995,5,B00005ATQJ,"This is the introspective version of the story, unlike the later version that King preferred.  It is the story of a family down on its luck, so the father takes a job as caretaker of a remote hotel that is supposed to be on some kind of ancient Indian burial ground.  Strange murderous things happened there before, but no one knows exactly what.  The mother and boy feel the tension vis-a-vis the father, who is a recovering alcoholic boiling with the most terrible anger.  He clearly loves the boy, but the mother blames him for a violent action he had made when drunk.  This is all understated, in the background but every detail of what unfolds fits in with this psychology.  It is a masterpiece like cut crystal.

Jack Nicholson is at the height of his powers here, young and still with a spirit to experiment with his roles rather than walking through the blatant commercial ones of his later career (however well he did them).  He is a troubled father and stalled writer, on his last legs in many ways.  You feel this just by looking at him, every gesture of the character consistent with his mental state.  He looks frightening, but there is love in him, too, as the thing begins to struggle for his mind.  Shelly Duvall, his wife, is is absolutely amazing, as she watches, the terror mounting inside of her until she can barely speak.  Finally, the boy - with supernatural powers of extrasensory communication -  calls for help.  The boy and his mother know something is coming, as the visions mount and strange occurrences begin.

Nicholson is haunted by visions and begins to drink.  But it is clear that he has been under pressure the entire time they have been isoated there.  When Duvall discovers that something is wrong, it is one of the most terrifying moments in cinema that I have ever seen, but what does it is her acting, her demeanor of hysteria and despair.  I totally believed her.

There are also many mysteries in the film, strange clues that remain unexplained.  My favorite is the appearance of Nicholson in an old photograph, leaving it to the viewer to interpret.  It is a one wonderful detail among many that enter the careful viewers' imagination to fit in with all the other parts of the film.  It is brilliant and perfect, just like the way that the boy escapes.

Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  One of the best I have ever seen.",1289779200,,2374,4.610978520286396
1418996,4,B00005ATQJ,"""The Shining"" is a strange horror story based on a novel by Stephen King.  When watching this, you need to remember Stanley Kubrick is the director and he tends to have a lot of ""white space"" or time for artful like scenery.  Much of the first part of the movie has scenes of long winding roads, driving miles and miles up a mountain to a beautiful hotel.  There are also scenes of a young boy riding a three-wheel trike through long halls and empty rooms of the hotel.  A garden maze is also featured with tall green bushes cut in at least an acre of ground that the young boy and his mother navigate as the main character seems to watch above a model inside the hotel.

At the beginning, after a three hour drive for a job interview, most of it up the sinuous mountain road,  an aspiring novelist, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has an interview for an off-season job at a enormous Chalet-Type Hotel isolated in the Colorado mountains.  Jack, his wife (Shelly Duvall) and his young son (Danny Lloyd) move in for the five winter months, with the agreement to maintain the elegant hotel.  They will be isolated as the road to the mountain top is not cleared during the heavy winter storms.  Jack is told of the scary history of the hotel, which included murders by another custodian that they feared got ""cabin fever"" from being alone so long.  Jack laughs off the possibility he will get cabin fever, he just wants to be alone to write, and this job fits his needs perfectly.

Sinister powers begin to seep through the hotel and then flood it with chilling horror.  With remarkable visual panache and a keen sense of irony, Stanley Kubrick rehabilitates Stephen King's trashy, terrifying novel.",1280793600,,1695,4.59468438538206
1418997,5,B00005ATQJ,"IMO, 'The Shining' is a fantastic movie. So much so, before purchasing the VHS, I taped it from tv..Eventually, I bought the VHS. When DVD's first came out, I had no intention of buying duplicates. 'That is,' except for a few favorites.
The Shining, which falls in my favorite catagory, was then bought on DVD.
Then, Amazon had a deal, The Shining & The Shining remake, for 'X' price..the set ended up in my collection.

Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers played excellent roles. Each character, realistic.
Wendy and Danny held haunting looks, Jack, mad. 'wonder if he was acting, lol, and Scatman, going out of his way to help a family he didn't know but pitied.

I get goose bumps thinking about The Shining: The howling wind, Jack conversing with the dead, walking around hypnotically, intending to chop up his family, Wendy and Danny hiding and terrified.

Although I love Steven King, I wouldn't buy a novel/movie because his name is on the cover. In fact, I prefer his older writing to new. It wouldn't have mattered who wrote The Shining; it was a great story.

It's true King wasn't satisfied with the first Shining film. I think he felt cutting certain parts, like the topiary scenes, didn't do his movie justice, didn't express meanings he conveyed through his writing.
Yet, he agreed the show would go on, despite his opinions and feelings. The Shining was one of the first movies that made him what he is today.
Mention Steven King and most think, Here's Johnny...

Another thing. Some people complain the book and movie differs. That's understandable. I can't think of one book, made into a movie, with word by word lines and deeds. Despite the author.
Cujo is a good example. Totally different ending.
King once said, the only movie he's seen that is true to the book, is Rosemary's Baby. Close, but untrue.

For those who love horror, check out The Shining. Rent/buy the tape, don't bother watching on TV. Dubbing ruins it. Not to mention annoying commercials.",1279670400,,2004,4.794202898550725
1418998,5,B00005ATQJ,"This is my favorite Steven King-novel-based movie of all time. Honestly, I have never read the book, so I guess you can take that statement half serious. My second favorite is ""The Mist"", still having never read the book.

Any tweener or twenty-something that has never seen this really owes it to themselves to watch this masterpiece. Patience is necessary as you need to watch every scene and let it build. There is absolutely no CGI, of course.. and this film uses spectacular camera work, background noise, and the best visual effects of the time to produce some very chilling scenes. It's jump out of your seat scary.

This film makes junk like ""13 Ghosts"" look pathetic! If you think that was scary, watch ""The Shining"". I stress to you that you must watch the original and not the remake with Steven Wright.

Pop culture has borrowed much from this film, from recent TV commericals (where a family was booked in a place similar to ""The Overlook"") and of course lines like ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"".

Highly recommended to all! Thank you for reading!",1277942400,2,1075,4.6421052631578945

The boy Danny has special abilities:  a secret friend inhabiting him (which is not satisfactorily explained) and the ability to hear others' thoughts (the Shining).  But buildings can have shinings too.  Homicidal rages from a formerly easy going author (typing nonstop pages of ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" is hilarious) taking orders from the ghosts and supernatural beings that in habit the hotel.

Shelly Duvall had the most number of takes ever, I read.

The movie does have its chilling, insane moments.  I enjoyed the boy's horror but was not sure if it was ""Tony"" his imaginary friend talking or Danny himself.  The ending is thoughtful but a bit of a let-down (the 1921 photo).

Overall, not a shabby movie. But really, how did Jack get out of that locked refrigerator?  Hmm?

The ""making of"" was shot by Vivian Kubrick, and you really get into the heads of the cast and what they were thinking as shooting progressed.

1419001,4,B00005ATQJ,"Shelley Duvall is just plain weird, and Stanley Kubrick morphed Stephen King's bestselling novel into something almost unrecognizable, yet THE SHINING stands the test of time and continues to scare generation after generation of wide-eyed viewers because the one-card-shy-of-a-full-deck Jack Torrance is so aptly and believably played by a demonically grinning Jack Nicholson.  No other part has been so tailor-made for Creepy Jack, who fits into the lead role like wiggling fingers into a well-worn glove.

Kubrick supplies the heady visuals:  a luxury mountain resort, about to be abandoned for the long winter, with its whispers of the past, labyrinth of hallways, and dark shadows.  Duvall and Nicholson supply the tension:  a struggling writer about to go off the deep end with his wife and small son living as caretakers at the resort, while the wife watches helplessly as her spouse unravels.  The hotel plays its part helping Jack Torrance descend into maniacal madness, giving Nicholson the vehicle he needs to grin and grimace and scream and shout as he terrorizes his family with flesh-crawling creepiness.

Sure, there are plenty of flaws; the film becomes silly and disjointed as it rushes towards its climax, some of the visual gimmicks (gallons of what looks like cranberry sauce spilling out of the elevators) are lame, and Duvall was definitely a weak link, but it doesn't take away from THE SHINING's ability to terrify.  I don't know what it's like firsthand to watch a man become violently evil, but Jack Nicholson in this movie gives me a pretty good idea.

I just didn't care...ever. And I didn't find it the least bit scary. I couldn't wait for it to get over. I like most King movies...but this one just dragged on forever.,1255305600,3,342,4.444444444444445
1419003,5,B00005ATQJ,"Whole volumes have been written about Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING, proving that it is indeed a masterpiece of modern horror.  A not to be underestimated element which makes this film full of atmosphere and tension is the lighting.  Every time I watch it I'm sucked up in the Overlook's universe because of that brilliant use of light.  In the European shorter version Kubrick wisely omitted the `skeletons in the lobby' tableau, which was right for a Hammer Dracula or Corman Poe film, but not THE SHINING.  Due to this photography and lighting, Kubrick makes of the Overlook a place where reality and nightmare blend.  And then there is the way in which he approaches the story (read:  alters King's story), thereby making it a much stronger ghost story.  In particular the surprise at the end (Jack Torrance picture on the wall) is a brilliant move which leaves us with the same feeling of disorientation as when we start awake from a nightmare.  That sort of confusion leaves us - at least for a while - mentally vulnerable, a prey to the horrors lurking in the subconscious.  King's book and Stanley's film should be seen as two totally different works of art (I still consider the book to be Stephen King's real masterpiece - a classic!).  Yet, the subtler approach of Kubrick places the story on a much higher level.  Perhaps these words by M. R. James explain it all:  ""the greatest successes have been scored by the authors who can make us envisage a definite time and place, and give us plenty of clear-cut and matter-of-fact detail, but who, when the climax is reached, allow us to be just a little in the dark as to the working of their machinery. We do not want to see the bones of [the] theory of the supernatural.""  That's what Kubrick's THE SHINING is all about, allowing us a peek into a terrifying universe where man starts to doubt his own sanity, where he loses track of time, forever doomed (is this, perhaps, the reason why Kubrick uses roll-up titles for the opening credits, something usually used for the end credits?).  With THE SHINING, Kubrick made a timeless chef-d'oeuvre.",1255219200,4,2103,4.7103825136612025

1419005,4,B00005ATQJ,"Is there a creepier movie than The Shining? This much is true: You won't ever want to stay in the real-life hotels again! The Stanley in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired King while he was here in Colorado, or Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood, Oregon, which provided the exterior shots.

In Mick Martin's movie guide, this is one of the few for which ""his"" review (admittedly, many of the reviews in the book are compiled from trusted reviewers) disagrees with my own in a big way. Specifically, he alleges that Nicholson's performance ""approaches high camp"" and that the movie itself is slow.

I, on the other hand, appreciate the slow burn and feel it gives us time to watch Jack Torrance slip (back?) into insanity. I've never been a huge fan of Shelley Duvall but each time I watch this I appreciate how she nailed the helpless wife/mother. Scatman Crothers (head chef and fellow ""Shiner"") is great.

Taking one star away for the deplorable lack of extras, although I imagine they've corrected that on the newer (Blu-ray?) release.",1252281600,2,1034,4.797752808988764

However I did not get the pleasure of seeing Jack Nickelson in one of his best performances until my Freshman year in college. Coincidently I saw it the night before I went to the Stanley Hotel (where the hotel was loosely based off of, here in Colorado.

The movie very much screams 70s style and horror, with scary movie, and scary clothes from the 70s. But Jack does such a great job as a reformed dad who goes crazy while trying to write the great American novel as his wife and son help him babysit an abandoned hotel, vacant for the winter. You feel enough for the characters that you drawn into each of them, thereby scaring you and making you feel for them that much more.

I never read the book, so I had nothing to base it on. The only other movie of Kubrick's that I remember seeing would be 2001 and that was terribly boring. The only part I liked was Hal, that scene was pretty cool.

In short, it sucked. I knew it would suck when I looked at the counter and noticed nothing happened 45 minutes into the movie and it was going to last roughly 2 1/2 hours.

He did a lost of showing when he should have been telling or showing what was necessary for the movie. Nothing really developed. Nothing happened for 45 minutes, then all of a sudden he's getting mad at being interupted by his wife? What was eating at him? Was he having problems with coping with not drinking? I don't know, there was no hint at what was going on internally with these characters whatsoever. It was all showed, nothing was told. Why? Because Kubrick had no idea of what he was either trying to show or say, he just pretended he did.

The black guy travels all the way from another state just to get killed and provide a vehicle? That's all the Shining was good for? What did it do for the kid besides him repeatedly saying redrum?

I even went as far as to saying ""The Shining Stinks"" to my classmates. I finally watched it on television in 1986, and I was 19 at the time, and I still had to turn on all the lights in the house as it still gave me the willies. This was however, a teriffic story about a man and his family staying in a hotel high up in the Rockies. The hotel is supposedly haunted, and the man begins his own descent into madness. This film is soooo good you can use it for a Sunday School lesson in which you talk about the young rich ruler who goes to Jesus, and asks what he could do to enter Heaven, and Jesus finally tells him to sell his possessions, and follow him, and the ruler goes away because he didn't want to part with his possessions. You can also use this as a Marriage Counselling tool as there was evidently alot of failure to communicate with the man and his wife. I can see a whole mess of things that this film depicts with the man and his wife. There is however, one flaw where the man fully descends into madness, and tries to murder his family with an ax, and chases his son into a hedge maze, and the wife is running through the hotel, and alot of people become alive, and creatures, or humans wearing animal costumes, and so forth. I still don't know what this was all about, but Kubrick does a good job of balancing those scenes with the chase scenes through the maze. I feel that this is quite possibly the best film ever made.

Also, the music in the film overshadows every scene.  Scenes that aren't even the slightest bit suspenseful are scored with intense music.  To make things worse the camera angles are way off.  For instance, Jack rips a piece of paper from his typewriter, some intense music comes in, but the shot is taken from so far away that it leaves no impact at all.  The film is littered with this sort of aimless direction.

You learn nothing about the hotel.  You learn nothing about the characters.  Right from the beginning the movie attempts to be this sort of house-of-horrors but falls way short of that goal because you're not lead into it guessing. Right from chapter one, during the interview the Hotel administration - not acting as they should in a normal interview - come right out and state that people kill themselves who stay here, and they go into graphic detail and Nicholson is already doing his little crazy person talent show act.  I mean it's a total joke.

Short of the attention-to-sound which is Kubricks only talent - scenes where the kid is riding around on his 3 wheel, and hits a sequence of hardwood then carpets, was probably the only creative idea in this film.

I think only Nicholson fans like this movie, and there are many.  Hence the incredibly high ratings this movie gets.  Based on these ratings you would almost think it was as good as The Godfather, yet in reality this movie is not even as good as Earnest Goes To Camp.",1211673600,4,1610,4.6431095406360425
1419015,5,B00005ATQJ,"There are few films that can deliver the same chills and feeling of eminent dread that `The Shining' manages to bestow upon the viewer each and every time it is watched.  Just about every frame is perfectly crafted to entice genuine feelings of misery, fear and anguish.  This is one of those rare films that can stop your heart dead cold while simultaneously causing it to beat louder and faster than it has every beaten before.  `The Shining' is, in all honesty, one of the most effective horror films every filmed.

But, thankfully, it's also one of the smartest.

Yes, `The Shining', helmed at the capable hands of Stanley Kubrick, proves to be far more than a slew of cheap thrills but in the end becomes a fascinating film, one with enough `hidden' messages and meanings to keep the audience guessing long after the film has wrapped.  I love films that move you to ponder the vision behind it, and Kubrick has always been known as the supreme visionary.  `The Shining' is no exception.  When you look at Kubrick's work you can see his ability to make something deeply disturbing and ultimately `important'.  Just look at `A Clockwork Orange', `Eyes Wide Shut' and the obvious `2001: A Space Odyssey' and you'll see that Kubrick is far from a `simple' director.  So then `The Shining' would no doubt be far from a `simple' horror film.  When you watch and dissect all of the clues and tricks Kubrick places throughout the film (there are whole websites dedicated to this film and that very purpose) then you will begin to see this film in a whole new light entirely.

Couple Kubrick with the intensity that is Stephen King and you have the potential for greatness.

What I think happened here, sadly, is that many `horror' fans were expecting to see King's novel transported onto the screen; nothing more, nothing less.  Kubrick is not that simple.  If you look at what he did with `A Clockwork Orange' (although he did stay `truer' to that work than this) you can see that Kubrick always makes his films his own.  The same is true with `The Shining', but to a greater extreme.  Stanley Kubrick gave us his interpretation of the novel.  I admire this, adore this even.  Kubrick was a fascinating director who took chances and risks and they almost always paid off.  This is a masterful example of those risks working wonders for the finished product.

The film follows the Torrance family; Jack, Wendy and their son Danny.  Jack and his wife have been asked to care for the `OutLook Hotel' for the winter and they are more than looking forward to the task.  It doesn't take long though for this task to turn into a burden when strange things start taking place and Jack begins to descend into the darkness of insanity.

I don't really want to say much more about the plot or the events that unfold.  This is a film you really must see to fully appreciate.  What helps elevate this film is Jack Nicholson's flawless performance as Jack Torrance.  I'm going to broach the same subject I jostled around when reviewing Tim Burton's `Batman'.  Jack Nicholson always plays a variation of himself; and I adore this about him.  He's one of our greatest actors ever even if his range is slightly jilted by his overpowering demeanor.  I am the one person in all humanity who disliked his turn as The Joker.  I just thought it was too much.  It was an example of Jack playing Jack poorly (in my opinion)...but Jack Torrance is the supreme example of Jack playing Jack masterfully.  All his eccentricities are here in fullest form and they add so much to the fear permeating the film.  Any other actor would have fallen flat in my opinion for no one else can play Jack like Jack.  `The Shining' may be a smart film, but without Jack it would lose a lot of its chill-factor.

When you take a flawless director and take a flawless actor and give them free reign with a flawless script you have a flawless film; no way around it.

The other actors in the film have their ups and downs.  Danny Lloyd us very, very effective as Danny Torrance.  Next to Nicholson, Lloyd is perfectly cast.  They work off one another brilliantly, and Lloyd effectively carries one of the most spine-chilling scenes in the film (`redrum') and manages to stay with the viewer long after the credits have rolled.  Shelley Duvall is less effective (thus the Razzie nomination).  Her whiney annoyance is a little much to take at times, especially towards the films conclusion.  I won't give her too much flak though for she does prove to be frantically stimulating (especially in that bathroom scene) at times.  When every other facet of the film is perfect you tend to forgive effortlessly the minor faults.

In the end I must say that `The Shining' is in a league all its own.  As far as horror films go, there really is no better place to look.

1419016,5,B00005ATQJ,"To me, THE SHINING has to be looked at from several different angles. First, as a horror movie THE SHINING is a classic in the same league as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN,  and ROSEMARY'S BABY. Then, I look at how it stacks up as a Stanley Kubrick movie. In this regard, it's also a classic, with it's isolated / desolated atmosphere, and cold, vast set-pieces. Next, I judge THE SHINING against other Jack Nicholson films, and yep, his Jack Torrence role is up there with his take on the Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN and his version of Satan in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK. This is malevolent, crazy Jack at his best! Lastly, I ask myself how good THE SHINING is as a Stephen King movie. Well, it's right along-side of CARRIE and THE DEAD ZONE as far as I'm concerned. I loved King's novel and have read it many times. I just see the book and the movie as two completely separate entities that can be enjoyed on their own merits. So, I give THE SHINING it's due as a chilling masterpiece...",1206144000,2,981,4.360655737704918

1419018,5,B00005ATQJ,"Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING is one of the films that I have not changed my opinion on over the years. In fact, like most Kubrick films, I find that it gets better with each screening. It was an unqualified five star film experience because of the master direction of Stanley Kubric.

I didn't even know when invited to see this film by a friend that it was a Stanley Kubric movie and went to see it on a week night.  Needless to say I told my wife about it the moment I got home and asked her to see it that weekend.  Even though this film was not terribly true to the King novel we both felt that it was another wonderful Stanley Kubrick movie.

I also enjoyed the performances of both Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Jack Nickolson said during an interview that he really wished that he could have been in another Stanley Kubrick film.  Shelly Duval stated during her interview that Kubrick was merciless, but did help to bring out her very best performance.

I saw this film when originally released in Connecticut in 1980.  A few days later I overheard two ladies speaking about Jack Nickolson's performance in the mall and tuned in to hear what I thought would be great praise for both the actor and director of THE SHINING.  I was very surprised to hear that they thought Jack Nickolson should be ashamed of himself and that Kubrick had some nerve to release another such film in the United States (I assumed they were talking about CLOCKWORK). I guess they thought that Kubrick brought out the very worst in Jack.",1205020800,,1525,4.5

It has been ingrained in my mind ever since I first saw it. The tense atmosphere certainly helps the movie out and the climax is quite suspenseful. The true reason this movie is rated so high is because of Jack Nicholson. He created this perfectly creepy character and people still quote him years later. He is the reason the movie succeeds in being a horror/thriller. Great actors make great movies, well mostly. Obviously over 20 years old, the movie look dated and bland at times, but it still stands the test of time and that is the most important thing.

1419030,5,B00005ATQJ,"A brilliant film of Stanley Kubrick which builds itself into a crescendo of madness, and horror borne out of the claustraphobic isolation of the family at the overlook hotel. Jack Nickolson's character ""Jack Torrance"" - an aspiring writer suffering from writer's block takes up an odd winter job where he has to act as a keeper for the Overlook hotel during the peak winter months when it closes down as the roadways that lead to the hotel get blocked with snow during the winter. So Jack's job is to just stay at the hotel and do some small maintenance activities that require some manual intervention. So Jack moves in with his family (wife and son) to the hotel. The Hotel has a bad and spooky history of an earlier caretaker who was on the same assignment as Jack but ended up slaying his wife, 2 daughters and himself. It was explained as a spree of killing which was caused by the intense isolation caused by being cut of from the rest of the world staying at the hotel when access to the surrounding areas are blocked out by snow , and the depression that this isolation created for the caretaker. Jack then undergoes the same symptomps as he slowly falls into the madness that his own mind creates and ends up hunting down his wife and his child. This is a real frightning and freaky movie with non existent gore save for the few illusion seens when Jack and his child see the slain ghost people. This is a cult classic that sends shivers through your spine. Best to be seen all alone when no one is in the house and after dark. And the main fuel of the movie is the spooky acting of Jack Nicholson. You are genuinely scared of the character ""Jack Torrance"" that he plays. He brought such a realistic madness to the role. Kubrick and Jack Nicholson make this film work.

1419032,5,B00005ATQJ,"Any Stanley Kubrick film is difficult to review because he was in a league of his own, directing films in his own way leaving little room for comparison.  While I've never cared for the way some of his films are acted neccessarily, I've always loved the way they've looked and the way the make you feel.  This makes Kubrick a suitable fit for the horror genre.  The Shining, to me, has always been the ideal horror film, taking familiar horror elements to a new level.

While the film strays quite a bit from its source material, the ideal ingredients for the horror to take shape are there - mainly isolation and the cold of winter.  What better way to be scared then to be locked up in a large hotel for the winter where the phones don't work and Jack Nicholson can go nuts.

The real star of this film is the camera though.  Kubrick has a thing for long takes and tracking shots.  The best shots in this film occur when Danny is in the hallway.  The classic shot  that haunts me to this day is when Danny is riding his tricycle through the hallway revealing the forever eerie twin sisters.

The rest of the action is fairly predictable once Jack starts going nuts, and while Kubrick doesn't really stretch the paramaters of the story, his eye for creating horrific landcapes with his lens in the all too sterile Overlook Hotel are gripping to this day.  Add to that the tense score by Wendy Carlos and you have an unforgettable horror masterpiece.",1193788800,,1450,4.47148288973384
1419033,4,B00005ATQJ,"(4 1/2 *'s) After all these years, I hedged at the prospect of watching `The Shining`.  Having seen the snippets of Jack Nicholson's skillful performance, I partly dismissed the movie.  In my mind, thinking of his famous line, ""Here's Johnny!"" the film seemed a novelty, something entertaining in a way it wasn't intended.  Between Stanley Kubrick's amazing direction and Nicholson's and Shelly Duvall's excellent performances, first impressions can be misleading.  Watching `The Shining' is a real treat.

Most people are familiar with either the film or the Stephen King book or both, so I'll be brief about the plot:  Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a former Vermont school teacher, transitioning as a novelist.  He interviews as a hotel keeper during the off season in Colorado's high country with the prospect of bringing his family to the empty domain.  During the interview, his new employer delicately lets him know about a tragedy at the hotel several years ago:  A former caretaker became unhinged by cabin fever and had slain his entire family with an axe.  Unfazed by the history, Jack signs on the dotted.  At home his son Danny has rough times.  A visionary of sorts, his other personality picks up on future ominous events, making the boy dread their new venture.  At the hotel, they meet the head chef, Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who picks up on little Danny's perception with an ESP type awareness.

Both the story and Kubrick's masterful direction make 'The Shining' a horror classic.  From the start we get vertiginous mountain views and all of the visions seep into our unconscious core, making the deep winter mountain adventure chilling indeed.  Seldom have I seen such an effect of going around the bend.  Whether from the point of view of boy on a Big Wheel  or in an outdoor labyrinthine evergreen maze, the suspense of danger around every corner is palpable.  Foreshadowing is amply present, constantly building up every scene to each chosen climax.

While nearly a flawless horror movie, there are a few objections.  Jack makes some connections to the horrible past in ways that are meant to be authentic, but break some of the mood of the movie.  While the time frames are well connected between present and past, the execution leaves something to be desired as Jack finds a key player in the past.

Despite this minor objection, `The Shining' is a thriller.  The aftermath of my latent viewing is awe for Nicholson's creepy performance as the slowly transforming Jack, and Duvall's portrayal of growing terror is unnerving and frames Nicholson's performance perfectly.  Like Linda Blair before him, Danny Lloyd is perfectly believable as the little boy.  Happy Halloween! -JP |:>[",1193788800,,2713,5.026905829596412

If you don't think so, then you must not comprehend the sheer importance of any philosophy whatsoever(even if it's no philosophy at all) (don't get confused yet!)You may find this review minimalist, but that is simply due to the straightfoward (actually, not so straightforward) brilliance of this highly intelligent, and realistic picture. People are mean. Jack is mean. Women are scared of mean and angry beasts. Wendy is scared of the mean and angry beast that is her husband. Jack breaks down the door to the other side with his ax. I like to think of Wendy(the bathroom) as the super ego, the door as the ego, and the room with jack as the id. The room containing THE BEAST(which is Man himself) is much larger, and he breaks through, the id thus prevailing, as in reality it obviously does. I watched this film once. It is the gretest use of celluloid, and any other substance in this universe until this day. 7 years later one frame hasn't been forgotten, and I keep figuring things out in my head as I contemplate. I oughta watch it again sometime. It's kinda like Eraserhead for a King.

Watching it at an older age, her character doesn't irritate me for some reason. Jack Nicholson's antics always amaze me and I never seem to tire of them. I was surprised to learn in some trivia that Stephen King wasn't happy at first when he was chosen for the role.

When an alcoholic on the wagon agrees to isolate himself and his family by taking a winter caretaker position at a large Colorado hotel, it seems like the perfect job, especially for an aspiring writer who hopes to finish his novel. Then old ghosts hatch a plan to tear down the serenity of the lodge and replace it with their haunted past. This movie will still keep viewers on their toes, despite having been filmed in the eighties when many advances in special effects hadn't been made. 'The Shining' is so character driven that it really didn't need all the cinematic tricks. I really miss director Stanley Kubrick and his magic.

1419059,4,B00005ATQJ,"When I was 12 (oh so long ago) back in the early 80's I stumbled upon Stephen King (well, not literally, he was in Maine at the time:) and from my first read (I think it was one of his short story collections) I devoured each and every book he came out with.  I remember reading the Shining feverishly in my basement (it helped with the atmosphere) and thinking it was just about the best thing I had ever read.  I sailed through it, and literally the moment after I read the last sentence, I hopped on my Schwinn 10 Speed and peddled like crazy down to the local VHS rental store.  I just knew the movie was going to be great, how could it not be?  Well, about 10 minutes into the movie I became horrified to learn that Kubrik had filmed his own vision, not Stephen's.  Tony as a finger?!?  ""Ullman didn't even like Jack, for cryin' out loud!!!"" I was reduced to yelling at the TV.  Even the casting was insulting; never in a million years did I picture Shelly Duvall as Wendy, and Jack?? His innate craziness erased all of the pathos of the Jack Torrance character.  Ultimately, my grand vision was deflated and I sat in a depressive like state wondering how Stephen could let him do this.  Disappointed was an understatement, I was mad!  From that day, I vowed never to view that movie again. Well, a decade later I had calmed down and decided it was worth another chance.  And to my surprise, I realized that I liked the movie.  I just watched it again this weekend (thank you powers that be for the gift that is the CHILLER Channel!) and found that it scared me just about as bad as the book.  But in a totally different way.  As long as I keep it a separate entity from the book, it stands on it's own as one creepy ride!  (Listening to that classical track in the beginning as they drive through the mountains makes me uneasy every time).  Kubrik's Shining should not be thought of as a movie version of the book, in fact, don't even think of them together... you'll be happier that way.  Just enjoy both, on their own for the different scares they provide, and thank your lucky stars that we have them.  Oh, and ya gotta love that Scatman!",1174348800,4,2147,4.311720698254364

1419076,4,B00005ATQJ,"Stanley Kubrick's landmark film is based on one of Stephen King's best novels.  The book is great, and the movie, though very different from the book, is pretty good.

The story centers on a writer (Jack Nicholson) who takes over the position of caretaker at an isolated Colorado resort hotel.  Soon, he and his wife and son are snowed-in at the hotel.  Soon some ghosts begin to appear. And sooner than both of those things, Nicholson begins to go nuts.  That's the one key difference from the book--as in King's ""The Shining,"" the caretaker slowly begins to lose his mind in a subtle, seductive way.  In Kubrick's version, Nicholson's caretaker is pretty much insane from scene 1.

The movie is filled with many iconic images, that even if you haven't seen the film, you will probably recognize.  The film also has a great score.  If the movie has any flaws--it would be the slow pace and the lackluster performance from leading actress Shelley Duvall.

The DVD includes a creepy trailer and a very-good ""documentary"" about the making of the film.  The best part of the documentary are the clips of Kubrick absolutely torturing lead actress Shelley Duvall into getting the scene right.  It's the type of uncensored, unapologetic look at a director that you wouldn't see today.

But, being a fan of Stanley Kubrick, I can see something special about this movie that makes me consider this one as the third installment of a so called, by myself, ""trilogy"". 2001: A Space Odyssey, Clockwork Orange & The Shining, they three share a feeling of loneliness, a sense of an external consciousness who is watching, from outside the Universe, the characters in the films. There is a feeling of a paranormal environment, manifest by the lighting, the sharp contrast of colors white, blue, red and fog in some of the scenes. And, this special environment is made even more surreal by the very special soundtracks of ""Atmospheres"" by Gyorgy Ligeti , ""Timesteps"" by Wendy Carlos, or the  score in The Shining by Carlos' couple too. Perhaps these three stories are part of the intervention of the Black Monoliths on the development of Mankind...Who knows?

Embedded meanings and dark nights of the soul that underpin what is essentially a small scale story of isolation and madness in an isolated Colorado hotel. Like the novels of Samuel Beckett, the Shining strips human psychology down to the floorboards. And what is revealed is a wretched and inescapable image of terrible things that men have done in the past, are doing now, and will do again in future time.",1159574400,,485,4.785714285714286

Jack Torrance (Nicholson) agrees to take care of a hotel in the off season so he can work on his writing in peace, so his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, tag along. They should have realized they were not as alone as they thought because their son's friend, Tony, apprised them of this via shining. Does Jack really love his family the way he says he does? Is it true alcohol makes us hurt the people closest to us, or is it a demon of another sort? The unique pleasure of a Kubrick film is not necessarily the story itself; rather, it is the unique way in which he tells it. Watch his movies for the performances he coaxes from the actors, for the deliberate pacing or for his sardonic humor. Much the way Frank Sinatra could take any song and make it his own, Kubrick could take any source material and brand it indelibly with his own distinctive mark. Pure cinematic enjoyment. As an aside, I would dread being in Stephen King's family. Is Jack Torrance his alter ego? Does he fantasize about killing his family?

The first movie I ever saw Jack Nicholson in was One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest, and then I saw him in this, so I automatically see him as crazy, his wild eyes and forehead and that hair help with that vision greatly! Although the book explained what Shining was in more detail, Kubrick shortened it enough to get the point across, to me his films although they are visceral and sometimes leave a bad taste in your mouth, are so cleanly lit and the sets are maddeningly perfect.

 I was certainly scared, of ""that"" room, the lady in the tub, the twin girls, all the blood, but what I was most scared of was how badly that hotel wanted that family to suffer and die, and how desperate Wendy was to save her child and realize that by doing that she had to kill her husband. Kubrick really got across the struggle between disbelief and the resolve to survive. The only thing I couldn't stand, and its no fault of Kubricks, or Kings, but the whole ""redrum"" chant to this day is a bit comical for me, because everyone copies it, holding up their finger, making their voice strange and gravely, I even do it at inappropriate times, like when I see some kid in the mall with a bowl cut.

and just because mr. kubrick was a great director doesn't mean that everything he did was good,this is the worst job i think he ever did directing a movie!!!!! he has taken a personal horror story(ghost story really) and turned it into an inpersonal story of madness and empty space!

1419089,1,B00005ATQJ,"The next few comments have been screamed out aloud by me for many many years, from the outer regions of the universe, from the rocks and the deserts, from the rooftops of the highest buildings, but did anyone get it? Isn't there really anybody out there who agrees with me that ""The Shining"" is one big boring turkey? A flaw, dull, badly made movie with one Jack Nicholson in his most cheesy, routined and most over-acted performance of his entire carreer, and made by one Mr. Kubrick who, in my book, is the most overrated director ever to emerge on the surface of this earth?

Chopping away with an axe, grinning into the camera and crying out ""Wooohaaah!"" with extended arms and grabbing fingers is not scary to me. The fact that all this is done by a man who once was a loving father and devoted husband, is, however. So, if this is the case, the main theme of a film which has somebody like this walking around and through the sets, must be the journey into madness this guy involuntarily must undergo. Questions arise: what makes a decent father and husband into a axe-yielding maniac, on the brink of madness and on the very moment of killing his beloved ones? What has triggered him, what are the hidden secrets that lie behind his thin facade of quietness?

And in the case of ""The shining"", what is the role of the enormous Overlook Hotel in all this? Does it merely contribute to this journey by profiding giant empty hallways as chilly, desolate background? Or are there underlying secrets too, locked away behind doors that hang tightly in there hinges?

The downward spiral, and for the audience to be a witness of it without having the chance to intervere, to put things straight, is what would make tension build to almost unbearable extremes.

But for some reason Kubrick skips this very thing that gives the movie its potency and the possibility to become the next ""Repulsion"" or ""Rosemary's baby"". And talk about modern films which use these senses of paranoia within apartment bildings and the likes, take a look at the original ""Dark water"", the Japanese movie in which a damp, chilly appartment building has some terrifying secrets to reveal too, and does this so with much less obviousness and far more subtleness than ""The Shining"" - the result: real tension to be felt throughout the haunted place, and the haunted movie for that matter, and one scene filled with suspense and unease after another.

I know all this, but apparently not many others. I feel like a little kid telling things that really matter but which no one in the adult worlds bothers to listen to.

1419090,5,B00005ATQJ,"I went to see ""The ""Shining"" in the movie theater back in 1980 when it originally came out.  At 13 there were some parts of the plot I couldn't grasp at the time, but even then I knew a great movie when I saw it.  The movie, like the book, takes place in the heart of the Rocky Mountains of Colorodo.  As an Oregon native, however, I immediately realized that the shot of the outside of the Overlook Hotel was made using Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood in Oregon.  The inside shots were filmed in England I believe.  Trust me, though Timberline Lodge is a beautiful place, it doesn't look like the inside of the Overlook Hotel.

The movie deviates some from the book.  The 1997 miniseries version is much closer to the book.  Kubrick and the writers use so many great suble tools to make the movie effective.  The characters are interesting enough.  Jack Torrence is a former school teacher who is insecure (we see in the movie he fears having to work in a car wash).  He is also a recovering alchoholic.  There are hints that he left the teaching profession under duress and that he is an abusive father.  Still, the Jack we see for the first half of the movie is a steady person.  It is during the second half of the movie that the more sinister parts of his character start seeping through.

The Shining reminds me of The Ring in some aspects as it uses quick but powerful images to direct the movie.  As you see the movie more times, you pick up on more subtle details of the movie that you missed before.  Therefore it is definately worth owning.  Some details of the movie remain a mystery to me.  What did Mr. Grady mean when he told Jack that ""you have always been the caretaker here""?  This idea is apparently revisited at the end of the movie when we see him in a photograph at a New Year's Eve Party from early in the century.  Though the movie leaves many mysteries behind, it is a modern masterpiece and is definately worth buying and adding to your library.",1147046400,2,1968,4.351648351648351

1419092,5,B00005ATQJ,The Shining~ Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite movies of all time. Nicholson is amazing in the role as Jack Torrence and Duvall is not bad as his meek and sweet wife Wendy Torrence. The suspense and the psychological effects are harrowing and Jacks descent into madness is truly frightening. The music is very similair to that of Hitchkocks Psycho. The movie is so much better then the book and Kubrick has turned a fairly mediocre book into one of the best horrror movies of all time. Danny Lloyd was amazing in his one and only role and it is truly strange that he did not star in any more movies. This is one of the best horrror movies of all time and like I mentioned earlier Nicholson does a stunning job with the role.

Endless, mazing corridors; rooms almost vibrating with supernatural potential. This movie captures that atmosphere and dread and makes us feel it all over again in spectacular visuals, stroking the darker aspects of our collective unconscious like a cold, clammy finger. Add into the mix Wendy Carlos's chilling soundtrack - which accentuates the visuals to creepy perfection - and you have the recipe for a genuinely nightmarish experience.

The acting, all 'round, is impeccable. Kubrick milked these actors for all they were worth, and it shows, from Jack all the way down to the child actors.

For some, especially the younger generation (who are used to the hyperkineticism which seems to define 21st Century entertainment), this movie might seem to drag. But for me, it goes by all too fast.

1419097,5,B00005ATQJ,"As with most projects like this, there are two distinct versions of The Shining.  There is the novel by Stephen King, and then there is the movie directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring the phychotic superman Jack Nicholson.  Two very distinct versions.  I love them both.  Now, what we need to understand for the purists is that you should never compare the book with the movie, especially here, because they barely resemble each other.  Stanley Kubrick was a prick.  Great filmaker, but a prick.  I read a story about how he called Stephen King up at three o'clock in the morning and asked him if he believed in God, then hung up when King answered the question.  Weird.  What Kubrick couldn't comprehend about King's novel is obvious.  Jack Torrence is an out-of-work semi-retired-alcoholic who's had a tough time of making things go his way.  He's been fired from his last job for nearly killing a student who slashed his tires.  Anyway, Jack here is an average Joe with a bit of a drinking problem and a bit of a temper problem, but otherwise okay.  He goes mad.  One step at a time he goes bonkers.  Now...the second we see Jack Nicholson, we think he's insane, because that's what Jack does to us.  The Overlook hotel wants Danny Torrence because of his gift of clairvoyance.  It uses his father to get him.  In the movie it seems as if the hotel is just haunted and Jack is insane and he's got a bunch of ghosts telling him to kill off his family.  Kewel.  Stepping away from the Stephen King version, you gotta love The Shining.  Jack Nicholson is awesome as everyone's favorite lunatic.  Great suspense.  Creepy music and scenery.  The Shining has it all.  Just stay away from comparing it to the book and you'll be okay.

This film is allegedly based on a good Stephen King story, and some people think it was influenced by Resnais' immaculate masterpiece Last Year at Marienbad. Well, it does look as if Stanley had actually seen Marienbad, but he clearly had not the faintest idea of what made that movie so sublime. Stanley's sandwich is no picnic. As usual, he relies entirely on design, design, design. As usual, the narrative is slow, slow, and plodding. Laboured. Leaden. Ponderous. The suffering actors, driven mad, not by the mind-numbingly dumb plot, but by Stanley's obsessions. There is absolutely no subtlety or even sense in this production. The fact that the cavalry will come to the rescue, summoned by telepathy (they usually do arrive by telepathy), is signalled so early on that there really isn't any suspense at all. The delaying tactics --- the phone lines cut, the radio ripped out, the sno-cat distributor removed, and then the other escape sno-cat not starting quite properly, are just crushingly corny. The only (slightly) surprising thing was that the unfortunate cavalryman, who seemed like a half-way decent person, got axed suddenly. And what happened to his left arm? Or was that bit chopped in the final cut? I'll admit I felt a slight sense of tension to start with, but this feeling soon evaporated; the thing grew tedious, and eventually laughable. The rake-thin Mrs Torrance getting stuck in the bathroom window had distinct overtones of something out of Laurel and Hardy --- or am I thinking of Pooh Bear wedged in the rabbit-hole?  No, she wasn't carrying an ounce of fat. And who was that naked lady in the bath? Judy O'Grady? A portent of things to come in Eyes Wide Shut, perhaps. What about that final shot: I suppose we were supposed to understand that Jack was a re-incarnation of a man who'd lived in 1921; but it still doesn't add up. When I started writing this I had two stars at the back of my mind, based on the design/cinematography, the counterpoint idea of having a would-be terror/horror tale shot in day-bright colours and mainly with massive lighting; but no, one star will have to suffice. You still have to admire the way Stan the man won a reputation as one of the 20th century's greatest film-makers on a body of work so much of which is basically nothing squared, or even cubed.",1141948800,14,2439,4.752358490566038

1419102,5,B00005ATQJ,"This Kubrik directed adaption of the Stephen King novel is actually better than the book in my opinion.  Kubrik gets right to the heart of the story and eliminates the unnecessary fluff that is in King's version.  The soundtrack also sets the mood and helps contribute to the gripping pace.

The young actor who plays Doc is excellent.  The scenes between him and Jack Nicholson early in the film are so touching.  The boy has such a maturity about him that is really amazing.

Shelley Duvall as well is such a fine actress, she is very underrated.  Included in the DVD version is a commentary where you can see how she was definitely treated as a ""second fiddle"" to Jack Nicholson as the ""star.""  This obviously bothered her, but she used that frustration in her work and it only served to better her performance.

Scatman Crothers is incredible and serves as a catalyst to get the story to the next level.  I believe this was his last screen role.

What more can be said about Jack Nicholson's performance?  This man is one of our more talented actors and plays this role about as over the top as you can get.  He chews the scenery down to the nub, but that is what was required here.  The character of Jack Torrance goes insane over the course of the film and Jack Nicholson sells us on it, with every glare, cocked eyebrow, and cheesy grin.

Brimming with amazing camera effects, terrifying sequences of outright horror, a great score and, as one of the most diabolical characters in cinematic history, a dynamite performance by my favorite actor, the one and only Jack Nicholson.

Author Jack Torrence (Nicholson) has been hired as an off season caretaker at The Overlook Hotel, a secluded country getaway located high in the snow covered Rocky Mountains. Of course, there's a little story behind the hotel, a story of great terror. This does not seem to frighten his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall), but his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) seems a little...apprehensive about the situation. When the family arrives, everything seems fine at first. But slowly, Jack is beginning to lose it. His temper is growing shorter. He's beginning to have nightmares. He sees disturbing visions. He's become a loose cannon, and no one knows why...or do they? Danny learns of his special pyschic gift known as the shining, and what he sees are visions of great error. This series of events leads to an all out roller coaster of bonechilling thrills.

It's very hard to find a film that chills your bones and gets under your skin like The Shining does, and it's equaly hard to find a villian who haunts you long after you've seen the film like Jack does.  Jack Nicholson nailed this performance with conviction and pure insanity, you could really be afraid of this man.  My only complaint it the overly obnoxious acting on the part of Shelley Duvall who played Jack's wife.  She was really annoying.  Danny Lloyd who played the son Danny (it's funny how both Jack and Danny play charactors named Jack and Danny) was frightening.  I rest my case, little kids are creepy as hell.  The whole redrum scene where he's in his mothers room and he's repeating 'redrum' over and over in this demonic voice, I was cringing...It was so nerveracking.  That poor woman...no matter how annoying she was, she had to deal with a crazy husband weilding an ax and a crazy psychic son.  The scene where she locks Jack in the storage room and he's pleading with her to let him out...where he was like ""you hurt my head real bad"" I mean, that was acting genious.  This film proved what people have been saying forever...Jack Nicholson is a freaking legend.  Watch this film.  While it may not follow the book to a T Kubrick is a cinimatic master and with Nicholson as his main attraction with is a show worth it's weight in gold.",1141084800,6,1510,4.467153284671533
1419108,5,B00005ATQJ,"There are movies with multi-million dollar special effect and makeup budgets that give you a good scare. Then there are movies like Shining, which have very little in the way of special effects, but can scare the bejeezus out of you, with atmosphere alone.

Like others have noted, the Shining owes its uniqueness to two things - directing talent of Stanley Kubrick, and the acting talent of Jack Nicholson. It's hard to imagine anyone but Nicholson provide the genuine insanity of Jack Torrance. Coupled with exquisite cinematic talent of Kubrick, the scenes of The Shining are far more realistic and horrifying than any amount of special effects could achieve. Music alone can easily make the hairs on your neck stand up.

Again, I largely credit Kubrick with the success of the Shining, not Stephen King, whose other book-based films are generally forgettable, if not often silly (Dreamcatcher and It, anyone?) It may also interest you to know that King himself dislikes this version of the book, and has often stated so (perhaps not too surprising).",1139788800,3,1053,5.011428571428572
1419109,3,B00005ATQJ,I love this movie. It is the only horror movie you don't forget anything. If Stephen King doesn't like this version he needs to come here and read these reviews. My husband and I don't really like the new version of the shining. No one can play Jack but Jack Nicholson. When I see him in anything else I still see him as Jack from the shining. I read the book just because of the movie.  I love the original version of this movie. It is one of my favorites. I also really didn't like the new Wendy in the new version. They were too different from the original ones. My only problem is not with the movie itself. It's with Amazon Instant video. I bought this movie so I could have it on my computer and tv without getting the dvd out. I was sorely disappointed when I realized they edited out some scenes that were creepy and one to me is very important to the story. If you had not seen this movie you would not understand what happened. The first scene removed was the scene with the man on the bed and had a person at the foot of the bed in a bear outfit and they both turned and looked at the boy. It't  not important but very creepy knowing there was no one else in the hotel. The second scene which removing it may confuse someone about what happened. It was the scene where the son goes into the room 227 thinking his mother is in the room. They show that part and then they cut out what happens with the woman in the tub. They just show Wendy with Jack and they son walks in the room with the tattered shirt and marks on his neck. This is not the first movie I bought that took out important scenes. The other movie was Land of the Dead. I wish Amazon would let you know when they edit a movie. I would think twice before I buy it that way. I just do it so I don't have to worry about a disc I play alot getting scratched by repeated watching.,1138492800,3,1850,4.051912568306011
1419110,5,B00005ATQJ,"Classic horror film starring jackie boy, and to this day some parts are still funny. I think bashing someone's brains in qualifies for ""hurting"" someone hehe. The most disgusting scene in this film was when he went up to the room where the woman who supposedly straggled danny was, and jack sees a beautiful naked woman in the bathtub, and she gets out and begins kissing him, and he suddenly felt that something was wrong and glances in the mirror to see what he was REALLY kissing and caressing, and it was an old women, who's body was deceased and rotting from the decomposition, and the water was all gross and her skin was falling off with huge brown patches of missing skin. And that horrible deranged laugh that was constant as she tried following him out of the room, kinda scary if you see this for the first time and don't expect it hehe. That scene makes me wanna hurl, and i think the movie the faculty copied that scene when the old woman walked into the shower room, and her skin was also loose rotting and gross, anyways lol. This film gets under your skin, no pun intended, and the parts when it showed the twin girls chopped up and bloody use to scare me as a kid. This was indeed a successful horror film, and many movies stole ideas from the shining, but weren't successful anyway. I never get tired of this movie, jack nicholson is one of my favorite actors of all time.",1137974400,2,1390,4.412451361867705
1419111,4,B00005ATQJ,"I'll put this in perspective: the only other Kubrick film I've seen is Clockwork Orange which I didn't like all that much. So I guess in a way it's perfect for people inquiring about this film since I'm not a ""anything director touches is gold"" idea. I've never seen Dr Strangelove or 2001 so I'm merely reviewing this as a movie fan and not a Kubrick one, even though the film is quite good.

Jack Torrance is a teacher/struggling writer and a job as an off-season caretaker is just the trip he needs to clear his head. Off to the Overlook Hotel with his wife and son, he takes up residence in there only to find that they're not exactly the only occupants in the place. And Jack starts to find himself changing by the day.

Earlier I posted a review for the Exorcist, another well-made horror film and another thing felt familiar: the parody of the scenes. Maybe because they're parodied and lose their shock then many of the images in this film weren't scary but more unsettling. But still, love those parodies(All beer and no TV make Homer something something).  The images however are memorable: the twin girls, the blood getting off the elevator and a guy in a bear suit, qualifying for the biggest ""what the hell?"" moment in film.

One thing that did irritate me about the film was the music: it was a bit too overbearing. It's almost as if the music was going ""be scared, hurry up and be scared already!"". Music in essence shouldn't do that, it should supply it without you being conciously aware of it. While it does its job of being very unnerving and being ""scary movie"" music, it felt a bit too loud at parts. Another thing the film had which you I can understand is a large amount of tracking steadicam shots. There's probably at least 15 or so in the entire film.

With good performances, memorable scenes and good tracking shots(although really used excessively), it's not the most scariest film ever, it's just a really well-done thriller movie.",1137974400,3,1961,4.5754985754985755

The main purpose of this review, however, is to let those who may be wary of the ""television"" aspect ratio that this is how the movie was made and intended to be seen.",1137801600,6,471,4.3522727272727275

1419114,3,B00005ATQJ,"Not so much a horror film as a treatise on the psychological state and how it is influenced by and reacts to its surroundings (environment, people, past, etc.). Like most Kubrick films, `The Shining' is deliberately detached and calculating. I believe that the performance by Nicholson at times (although progressively over the top), as well as Crothers (the only character I cared about; it is difficult to care about a character in a Kubrick film) are fine. I think Duvall was miscast and the boy was rather annoying with the hokey ""redrum"" scribblings and the obnoxious finger talking. Overall character development is lacking.

From a cinematographic point of view, there are some excellent shots, although they don't necessarily lend themselves to a feeling of suspense or tension (contrast this with the editing and shot selection in `Psycho'). I think that the pacing of this film is at times quite tedious. The film is not scary. While the film's psychological underpinnings are interesting, the plot itself has holes. I find it convenient that the police don't bother to check out a remote place where there was a gruesome murder when the radio stops working. I would venture to guess that over five months some cops would drop by to check out what is going on at least once or twice, especially if there wasn't any contact. Crothers takes a day to get to the place. You think he could have called the authorities? They might have gotten there a tad quicker. The wife also should have known her husband was losing it and could have made an effort to get out before he started to try and slash her. I don't think this is necessarily a flaw since she seemed to be in a state of denial herself. The boy's ability to ""shine"" is never really played out and ultimately ancillary to Jack's descent into madness.

Some reviewers consider this to be the best horror film of all time. That is an absurd statement. If Kubrick wasn't the director, would this claim be made? I doubt it. He's good, very good, but it doesn't mean `The Shining' is great. Stake your claim for a gender leader with '2001' or 'Dr. Strangelove', not 'The Shining.' It is clearly inferior to Psycho (by eons) and a number of offerings from Universal and Hammer, not to mention `Halloween' (released two years prior to `The Shining'), `Alien,' and plenty of others.",1136678400,6,2337,4.753694581280788

Perhaps Jack also has telekinetic powers he is just unaware of and he just imagined Grady was there doing it. The man in the photo who looks just like Jack. Well, it is possible that Jack had the shining when he came to the Overlook and he shined in on the happenings that went on in the 20's there and felt hew as there because a fellow who looked so damn much like him was there at the time. My view is there were no ghosts at all at The Overlook and the entire bizarre happenings were the Shinings of Jack, Wendy, Danny and Halloran and telekinetic powers of Jack.

PS Remember, Grady was not at the Overlook in the 20's. He was just there in the late 60's early 70's. Jack imagined him at the roaring 20's party.",1135209600,4,1027,4.160804020100502
1419117,4,B00005ATQJ,"This is going to be a fairly short review.  I'm not going to delve into summarizing the story or critiquing Kubrick's direction.  Frankly, this film has been so heralded and around so long that if you need to be recapped you haven't been paying enough attention.  Long story short, this is one of (if not THE) best haunted house film ever, made by one of the most influential directors in history.

Which leads to the question of why I'm giving it a four star rating instead of five?  I'm knocking it a star for the DVD not just EXPLODING with extras.  It's, basically, packed with nothing.  A short half-hour documentary, a commentary by Kubrick's daughter, and a trailer just isn't enough to do this justice.  Where's the commentary by Nicholson or King (who famously didn't enjoy this version)?  Where's the retrospective on how this film impacted the industry?  Where's the reflection by the cast on their experiences on the set?

This is a film that should have been an education to dive into and an opportunity to pay homage to a brilliant film-maker.  Warner Bros, however, seem to have decided this wasn't important to us.",1133913600,3,1130,4.7384615384615385
1419118,5,B00005ATQJ,"When critics appraise director Stanley Kubrick's extended output, they most often count ""The Shining"" as the odd duck, the one that never made it, the one that didn't live up to the great man's reputation. In fact, the film has been something of an embarrassment for Kubrick aficionados. Even his final effort, ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" got better notices than ""The Shining.""

Yet ""The Shining"" remains one of Kubrick's most popular pictures, the movie most non-Kubrick fans enjoy the most. Is this to suggest the director was purposely aiming his film at a lowbrow audience? I hope not. I'm a Kubrick fan, I appreciate his other work, and I love this film, too. Well, admittedly, I'm pretty lowbrow. Taken for what it is, an extremely well-made horror flick with a typically ambiguous Kubrick theme about the lingering effects of evil, ""The Shining"" stands head and shoulders over most of its competition. Now digitally restored and all the better to appreciate, this new version of the 1980 film makes its second DVD appearance within a year. It is part of a remastered series from Warner Bros. that includes ""Lolita,"" ""2001,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" all offered individually or as part of a boxed set of nine discs that also contains Columbia TriStar's ""Dr. Strangelove"" and an excellent documentary on Kubrick, ""A Life in Pictures.

 It's one of the few horror films that can still give me chills the fifth and sixth times around and make my hair stand on end.

Based on the novel by Stephen King, ""The Shining"" tells the story of a former alcoholic (Jack Nicholson) who takes his wife (Shelley Duvall) and five-year-old son (Danny Lloyd) to spend a winter as caretakers of an old, rambling, isolated hotel in the mountains. The conflict? The hotel is haunted by the ghosts of past atrocities, including the ax murder by a previous caretaker of his entire family. And the young son happens to be psychic, which adds to the dilemma; he is said to have ""the shining,"" the ability to read the future and talk to spirits. Before you can say ""Boo,"" the child is seeing all kinds of weird stuff, like the bloodied corpses of twin girls who were murdered at the hotel. Combine these spooky goings-on with the boy's well-founded fear of his father, who hurt him earlier in an alcoholic rage, and we know the poor kid is not exactly in for a pleasant winter vacation. As we suspect, it doesn't take long before old Jack starts to crack under the strain of solitude, ""cabin fever"" it's sometimes called, seeing ghosts, turning into an ax-wielding monster, and tearing after his wife and son.

Whatever its critics have said, I believe the film succeeds on almost every level. The first hour is appropriate introduction and exposition. It builds a mood of quiet tension. We can readily see there is something just a little wrong with the father, but we can't yet pin it down. By the second hour, all hell breaks loose, and in the last few minutes it's sheer terror. It's one of the few horror films that can still give me chills the fifth and sixth times around and make my hair stand on end.

Over the years I've heard ""The Shining"" faulted on three major counts: It goes on too long, the director is too constrained, and Nicholson is out of control. Let's take these items one at a time. First, is it really too long? Well, there is hardly a scene that could be deleted. Maybe the interview toward the beginning between the boy and the social-worker psychologist could have been dropped or shortened. Anything else? Nothing I can think of. Kubrick is a filmmaker who tells his stories largely through imagery, so naturally there are going to be long, lingering mood shots. It's a beautiful motion picture to look at, whether it's for the glorious outdoor scenery or the equally impressive indoors of the grand hotel. It may be the most good-looking horror movie ever made, and I love those long tracking shots through the hallways. The hotel itself is made to become a dynamic persona in the drama. Besides, Kubrick did later cut the film for television, and it only made it worse.

Second, is the director really too distant, too aloof from his characters? Again, I think not. Like E.A. Poe, Kubrick uses his characters to carry out his story line; they exist as vehicles to create an effect rather than as three-dimensional human beings in and of themselves. Not that we don't feel for the wife and child and their predicament; indeed, we come to care

about them very much by the end of the film. It's just that their personalities are not as important as what they're experiencing.

Finally, is Nicholson truly unrestrained? Much has been said of the apparent conflict between the ever-cool, ever-calculating director and the volatile actor, most criticism suggesting that Nicholson had more input than he should have had and was allowed to go over the top. The DVD's accompanying documentary, however, made during the film's shooting, refutes the argument. One sequence shows Kubrick telling Nicholson they will have to re-shoot a scene (Kubrick was notoriously exacting and would re-shoot scenes more times than most directors would have the patience or budget for) because Nicholson isn't acting ""mean"" enough! I'm convinced that most of what Nicholson did in the film was written, suggested, or encouraged by the director. The upshot, in any case, is a tour-de-force acting job. ""Heeere's Johnny!"" As much as for any of his many fine film roles, it may be for this performance that Nicholson is best remembered.

Video:

Although I liked the film the first time around on DVD, I had wished the picture quality was better. On the first disc, the image was only so-so at best, sometimes less. The transfer was clearly not made from as pristine a print as we could have hoped for, because age spots and grain were quite noticeable, especially in the beginning of each reel. With this new digitally restored and remastered edition, the video quality is greatly improved. It still isn't perfect, but the focus is sharpened, some of the more ragged edges are smoothed out, and much of the grain and most of the age spots are eliminated. Some flickering lines and some grittiness remain (especially in the opening sequence), but, overall, this is a substantial improvement over the film's first transfer to disc. The film is presented in a standard-screen, 1.33:1 aspect ratio, said to be the full-frame photography from which the theatrical widescreen version was later matted. Warner Bros. state on the box that the film is ""in the full aspect ratio of the original camera negative, as Stanley Kubrick intended."" The image is high, wide, and deep, quite a bit more so than I had remembered from its initial widescreen theatrical release.

Audio:

The other major improvement is in the sound. The first DVD rendering of the audio provided only a monaural soundtrack. Now, we get a remixed Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 track, rendering all the better the atmospheric music Kubrick chose to accompany the story--Bartok's ""Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta,"" for instance, and selections from Hector Berlioz, Wendy Carlos, Gyorgy Ligeti, and Krzysztof Penderecki. Since most of the excerpts Kubrick used were taken from commercially available stereo recordings (the Bartok is a von Karajan DG performance, for example), the remix is really from two-channel sources opened up to five. The results are far from spectacular, and they are still accompanied by some tape hiss and noise, but they are a decided improvement on the previous mono.

Extras:

The primary bonus item remains the behind-the-scenes documentary, ""The Making of the Shining,"" about thirty-five minutes long. It was shot by the director's daughter, Vivian Kubrick, much like a home movie during the feature film's production and includes interviews with cast and crew, and a good deal of inside information. Warner provide the same, generous forty scene selections and trailer as before, but now they include French in addition to English as a language choice and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Of course, if you buy the gift box, you also get the Kubrick documentary disc, ""A Life in Pictures,"" almost two-and-a-half hours long and telling us practically everything we ever wanted to know about the director, his movies, his motivations, and his themes. It's narrated by Tom Cruise and features interviews and commentary with Woody Allen, Arthur C. Clarke, Keir Dullea, Shelley Duvall, Nicole Kidman, Malcolm McDowell, Paul Mazursky, Jack Nickolson, Sydney Pollack, Martin Scorsese, Richard Schickel, Steven Spielberg, Peter Ustinov, and many more. Extensive film clips from Kubrick's films and from private sources take us behind the movies and into the soul of the man who made such unique films. Much of the documentary goes over material we already know, but much of it is new and fascinating, too. No Kubrick fan should be without it.

Parting Thoughts:

Supposedly, Stephen King hated Kubrick's interpretation of his book so much that in 1997 he wrote his own screenplay for a television miniseries. The result was a long, tedious, non-frightening experience that only proved how taut and well constructed Kubrick's treatment was. ""The Shining"" is a damn fine scary film, made all the better in its new DVD restoration. And remember, ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play.....""",1133222400,8,9484,4.936050156739812

1419121,5,B00005ATQJ,"This film is about as close as it gets to modern genius.  Kubrick just pulls you into the story and sets up an atmosphere of fear and uneasiness with a great cast and haunting images.  Did I mention that he compiled a great cast?  The actors he chose were perfect for their roles (more specifically Jack, his wife and child) that makes the movie that much more unusual and terrifying.  I remember watching this when I was a kid late at night and being extremely scared, but at the same time intrigued by how odd it is.

1419123,5,B00005ATQJ,"One cannot deny that Kubrick's vision of THE SHINING is brilliant.  The atmosphere is eeery, and while not entirely scary, can be difficult to watch late at night in the dark! The story focusses on a family who go up into the mountains to look after a hotel which is shutdown during the winter months.  Jack Nicholson is spot on as the father who is slowly going mad. Is it from the isolation, or is it from the evilness of the hotel itself?  Shelly Duvall plays his wife, and while I think they could have chosen someone better to play this role, she pulls it off adequately.

The marketing of the movie itself has a life of its own.  In the UK, it got poor reviews from a test audience in 1980, so Kubrick edited the film for international audiences down to a 113 minute version (in a sense a forced ""Director's cut""). This version is what all DVD's outside of America now feature. At least Kubrick made the cuts, and not Warner Bros.

Not having seen the longer 143 minute version, my concern is that the edited version does not answer many questions. I have read that the US version looks at the father's alcoholism, whereas the international version overlooks this.  One Aussie reviewer states that the edited version is ""nicely paced with more energy"". To me it just feels like something is missing from the international cut. It would have been nice of Warner Bros to add this additional 30 minutes as deleted scenes to the international DVD's.

Aspect ratio - originally filmed in 1:66 format, and transferred to DVD as 1:33 as requested by Kubrick. Best viewed on a standard TV. Kubrick was not a fan of widescreen movies.

Best advice to anyone considering buying this, is to grab the US DVD.",1130284800,,1702,4.554098360655738
1419124,5,B00005ATQJ,"Yeah, it ain't exactly like the book, I don't care. I've read the book and I like it, I also saw the two part TV version that tried to follow the book dead on, I didn't like it as much.

The movie does not try to be like the book, because Stanley Kubrick had a lot of different vision than the horrorful Stephen King.

Apparently Stephen King didn't like KUBRICKS adaptation very much. Let me just say that certain things work in the book that don't work as well in the film version of this ghost story.

For instance, the shrubs that come to life. Its kind of cheesy on the screen, theres no real way to do it. Replace the animal shaped shrubs with a maze of hedges, the center for an all out axe chase... now we are talking KUBRICK.

What the movie lacks is the over all influence of the ghosts themselves. In the KUBRICK version we get more of the sense that the real demons are in Jacks head. He is still battling with his alcoholism, his relationship with his wife. He has too many weaknesses to deal with this incredible gift of THE SHINING.

The story still follows the same structure. Danny, the boy, can see the future due to his gift. He can also see the past, which causes him to meet the two twin girls that were killed under similar circumstance.

The Outlook Hotel feeds on winter caretakers. Danny understands why he see's such things, JACK does not. When the ghosts start channeling their shining in physical means, things atrt getting ugly all around, and Jack eventually cracks up and tries to axe up his family, so that they will ""never have to leave.""

The maze is a highly effective symbol for the end of the movie, sure it compromises KINGS vision for KUBRICKS, but compromises well. Could you see a better ending for this movie than Jack Nicholson frozen on the ground with his axe, lost in the maze.

The book ending is not described in so much detail, but rather through a photograph of Jack and his OUTLOOK Hotel friends dated 1928.

This movie used to scare the crap out of me when I was real little, I've always been a huge fan of it.

The twin girls, REDRUM, the elevator full of blood, the creepy music throughout. STANLEY KUBRICK was an amazing film maker, check this one out for Halloween.",1130284800,3,2221,4.3951219512195125
1419125,5,B00005ATQJ,"Kubrick's The Shining has its detractors and admirers, especially among those who feel that the film is a celluloid masterpiece and the book is pulp garbage; or those who feel the film is pretentious and self-absorbed and the book is classic literature. I'm a fan of both of them.

Kubrick is more interested in creating a sense of claustrophobia and slowly looming menacing than in creating three-dimensional characters and seen as a mood piece, The Shining is pretty hard to surpass. This is due to the camera shots (many from a child's point of view), the title cards that lose all meaning, and Kubrick's brilliant use of the music of Ligeti, Bartok and Penderecki.

The acting is, to me, excellent, especially Shelley Duvall and Nicholson. Danny Lloyd is good, too, and Scatman Crothers turns in a memorable performance. The technical aspects of the film are superb, especially Danny's Big Wheel sound as he goes onto carpet/hardwood/carpet, etc. What always gets me is how Stuart Ullman calls the former caretaker ""Charles Grady"" and Jack calls him ""Delbert Grady."" Anyone got a reasonable answer for this?

A few things that people always complain about: first, Scatman Crothers getting killed. Many people feel that it is a waste of his character that he dies once entering the hotel after his journey up the mountain. This has a great effect, however, in that you know that Kubrick will kill a character at any time (King had Jack wield a roque mallet rather than an axe, which allowed King to beat up his main characters pretty badly without killing them). I mean, he has to go out killing at least one person, right?

Finally, people love to complain about what a wimp Wendy is in this picture. I think she's the hero of the movie. She deals with all of the day to day operations of the hotel: cooking for the family, running the boiler, communicating with the outside world. When Jack starts verbally abusing her, she still hangs in there, even after he confesses his murderous dream. Faced with all of the daily operations of the hotel, she then has to deal with a psychotic husband, a potential murderous crazy woman in the hotel (Jack could care less), and a beloved son descending into catatonia. Despite this, she still manages to whack Jack with the baseball bat (a tremendous act of courage) and lock him into dry storage and then somehow deals with him getting out and hunting her down in her bathroom, going crazy with the axe. Even then she has enough sense to defend herself. Kudos to Wendy, one of the most unsung heroines in all of horror films!",1130198400,3,2569,4.740492170022371

The Nicholson charactor descends into madness and total possession, his facial expressions contorted by insanity and the spell of the hotel's ghosts exhorting him to murder.

1419128,5,B00005ATQJ,"`The Shining', directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on the novel by Stephen King may be one of Kubrick's best movies, and may be the second best rendition of a Stephen King novel on film (next to `Carrie') and yet I understand Herr King has little respect for this film interpretation of his work. This is odd because aside from this work and the aforementioned `Carrie', there has been little of quality done on film with King's novels. I do confess that the TV miniseries based on `The Stand', arguably King's best novel, was decent, but I think that was only good, not great.

I always feel a very personal connection to this movie, as it's announcement was the reason I started reading Stephen King novels. I was in my local corner book store in Nyack (pre Borders / Barnes and Noble megastores, where the salespeople really knew your name and tastes) looking for `something new' to read in fiction. The owner / manager happened to suggest a new paperback copy of `The Shining' and I was unimpressed until I saw that it was scheduled to be made into a movie by Stanley (my very favorite director) Kubrick. That sold me and I snatched up the paperback faster than you can say `Here's Johnny'.

As it turned out, I was very pleased with the novel in its own right and set me off on a history of buying each Stephen King novel in hardcover as soon as it hit the bookstores (pre Amazon.com advance ordering). So, when the movie finally did come out (Kubrick always seemed to take forever between the announcement of a project and its final release), I rushed to see it with the same enthusiasm I had for `2001' and `Clockwork Orange'.

My reaction upon my first of many viewings was mixed at best. The first thing which bothered me was the way Jack Nicholson hammed up the part of Jack Torrence. His irritable leering give away the threat to wife and son long before King does in the novel. I believe it even starts before the little family actually takes up residence in the Overlook hotel. Nicholson partially redeems himself when he falls into full homicidal lunacy and does his famous bathroom door scene.

On Kubrick's part, his adaptation of the story overall is good and his blocking and cinematography is superb, but we would expect nothing less from Kubrick. The one area where he falls down is when he does not convey King's point that it is the hotel and not something Jack Torrence brings with him, or a simple case of cabin fever, which brings on Torrence senior's madness. Kubrick also minimizes the role of the chef, reducing his second appearance to nothing more than a device to bring a working snow cat to the hotel.

And yet, the movie endures and its reputation in my mind grows with each passing attempt to do justice to a King novel on film. `Misery' with Kathy Bates' Oscar winning performance has joined the select few good King movies, but most seem to simply drop to the bottom of the barrel of notable horror movies.

So, in the end, I have to give Kubrick high marks for succeeding where only George Romero has done well, out of all the King cinematic attempts, including some done by King himself.",1127606400,,3124,4.569642857142857
1419129,2,B00005ATQJ,"Well, I don't love it and it didn't even remotely scare me. I'll disect this film as brief as possible.

It's horrendously acted on purpose ? Nope, Kubrick didn't want the actors to be bad, as his many fans claim, they were bad because they couldn't act. It's that simple. Duvall and Crothers were so bad, they couldn't even rank on the fun, cheese factor scale.

Kubrick directed this so it must be art ? Nope. He tried to get oh-so-artistic but failed miserably. Besides, who wants ""art"" in a horror film, especially ones that concern ghosts ? Not me.

Jack was intentionally hammy ? Was he ? Maybe he was actually trying to be serious and wound up overdoing evrything and it turned out ""hammy."" True horror fans know that ham does not belong in a horror film.

Scary ? Could someone please tell me what was scary. When you have a horror film that's badly acted, and the  attempts at depth and artistic merits result in silliness, how can it be scary ? Distracting is a more appropriate word.

This film has so many metaphors and hidden messages ? Well, again some attempts were made, but the results were shallow and nothing more than vanity from the director.

The Shining is a film that tried so hard to be ""more"" than a horror film, but, in the end it's not even a likable horror film or a success at whatever it tried to be.",1127433600,8,1331,4.3861788617886175

For any child, heck any actor, it was a great performance, but for a six year old! It was fantastic! Such concentration and depth in the eyes, all ready to begin going beserka mental at any moment!

Shelley Duvall's hysteria and crying was also an impressive accomplishment for an actor, although her character did start to piss me off at one point during the film.

The hotel itself is the star of this movie though, and the cinemotography is top notch. Stanley Kubrick always tended to be somewhat mechanical and detached from the emotions onscreen as it is in the Shining, but the coldness adds to the bleak terror of it.

1419140,5,B00005ATQJ,"Wow. I just got done watching this movie that was recommended to me by a friend. I'm not going to use any new radical styles of reviews for this one. I started a new style of review, but I got interrupted part of the way through, and it RUINED the flow of seeing the movie as it happened. It was a fresh new outlook-review known as the Q-and-A-review, but now it's top-secret and I can't mention it anymore. Anyways, I'll just try to review it in more of a standard-review style, but it will be levelled-up because I'm Howard Tuttleman, and I can do that. Let's review!

Okay, there were 3 main-characters in this movie. A dad, a mom, and a smart little-kid. The mom was pretty much just and annoying whiner and cryer and I couldn't relate to her. Reminded me too much of my mom. The other two however, I made a personal connection with them. There were MANY times where I couldn't decide who to side with, because I saw parts of myself in both of them equally.

Okay, the kid REALLY reminded me of myself. So much that it was actually a little eerie. Basically, throught the movie he has thought-dreams that he can't explain, and he often goes into terrifying cloud-nightmares because of these visions. He has a power called ""The Shining"" that makes him go through all of this. You see, I too believe that I must have this out-standing power after seeing this movie. Ever since I was a young boy I have seen thing in thought-dreams, and my dad was always mean to me about them, just like in the movie. The meaner my dad got, the worse they would get, and then BAM! I could slip into a cloud-nightmare and go get lost. He writes stuff on the walls just like I always have too. And he loves running around all over the place like me too. He even goes to a Doctor, just like I visit Dr. Bertrand.

Now as far as the dad goes, I can relate to the fact that he's not always in control of what he does. He is a writer, much like myself, and he goes on a vacation to a HUGE mansion so he can concentrate more. His family, (mostly his wife) keep bugging him and bugging him and I know what THAT feels like. For example, earlier today:

Mom: Barry, where's Howard? Why won't he answer me?

Dad: He's just sitting there typing on my computer and watching a movie really loud.

Mom: Well go make him stop. It's time for dinner.

Me: Wait! Wait! This is really important for my career! If I stop in the middle of my review it will RUIN it! I can never watch this movie for the first time again!

Dad: What on earth are you watching?

Me: It's called ""The Shining"". It's about this guy who goes crazy and tries to kill his family for bothering him while he's trying to write. Why?

Dad: You know, uh....I think were going to have to see Dr. Bertrand more like uh, ONCE a week Howard.

Do you see how it goes? So anyways, there is this guy in a dog-costume in the movie that will give me night-mares for the rest of my life. Not just cloud-nightmares either. He just appears for no reason at all. At ALL. At this point in my mind, I can't imagine anything worse than this guy in his dog-costume just being there in my room for NO reason one night. Why does he wear it? Where does he live? And what would he do to you if he caught you!? I shiver at the thought. Hands down, the most horrifying movie-scene EVER to me. It didn't have to be that scary. I'm sure there's a deleted scene somewhere where they tell you all about him and his legend and practices and what-not, like most horror-movies.

Another thing about it is that the dad is possessed by evil-spirits that make him do irrational, bad-things. I'm pretty sure that this happens to me all of the time, so the movie wasn't all THAT shocking to me. No one ever believes me, but now I have a point of reference to back this strange phenomenon up with.

And I can TOTALLY relate to that persuasive bar-tender that offers him a drink when the dad KNOWS he's not supposed to drink. Now I'm DEFINITELY not talking about alcohol as this relates to me, because I don't drink. What I'm talking about is how people are always like, ""come on Howard, do something crazy with your fire-works."" and I'm like ""No, no guys, I really don't think I should. I might get in trouble or hurt someone."" and they're like ""Come ON Howard! Just this one time, Howard"". ""No, come on guys, cut me some slack, I'm trying to be good lately."" ""HOWARD! Just DO it. If you don't shoot those fire-works at something highly flammable we won't talk to you anymore!"" ""Okay, okay, just this one time guys. Jeez."". And there it goes. I get in trouble.

Oh, and there's this great hedge-maze. I would like to grow one of those some day.

There's probably a lot of great things I could talk about, but I was interrupted mid-movie, so I'm having thought-errors now that it's later. Later.

The sinister Overlook Hotel with it's monstrously long hallways, the rooms with God only knows in them, those terrifying twins...I'm always amazed to hear how King hated this movie and of all the criticism it receives.

1419142,5,B00005ATQJ,"I am so shocked that this movie even received one bad review. One. Some of these reviews here say that the movie is boring, too complicated and not scary. When you see Danny riding his little troller, how aren't you hooked. When the naked girl ""transforms"", admit that you jumped out of your seat.

This movie also isn't complicated, you just need to pay attention.

The plot of the movie is one of the most creative that I've ever seen. It is said to be unfaithful to the Stephen King book. I never read it and mr. King must be a pretty cocky guy if he thinks that he can remake this movie and top it.

This movie is perfect. No, I'm not kidding, it's perfect. Only this movie, Mulholland Drive and Psycho stand as perfect movies in my opinion. What I mean is that none of these movies have any flaws. They are 100% perfect.

Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a writer, takes a job to watch over and maintain a hotel complex up in the mountains in Denver. He goes there with his wife Wendy and son Danny.

At firs, he seems to be the perfect fit for the job but that's before he becomes mad.

Danny has the shining, an ability to see dead people and horrifiying images. He can also maintain conversations without opening his mouth. Danny Lloyd the actor who played him gives a performance that left me speechless.

Jack is also seeing crazy stuff, talking to a guy who used to care over the place who went really crazy.

The movie shows Jack on the brink of insanity. This movie shows the fear encountered towards a memeber of your family. And that is trully a terrifying thing.

The score is brillinat, going along with the pace of the movie.

The cinematography is my favorite part of the movie. It is the best of all time. It follows Danny on his troller from behind so you don't know what's around the corner. And that definitely builds up the chills.

The acting is wonderful. Jack Nicholson gives his best performance and one of the best of all time. He is terrifying and has so many great lines. Just look at his movements, his tone of voice, his eyes, his grimaces, he is a creepy guy. His perfromance is chilling.

Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd also give very good performances notably Lloyd.

The Shining is an absolutely horrifying movie, and is one of the few movies that scare me. And I don't get scared easily.

1419147,5,B00005ATQJ,"As far as most horror movies go not too many scare  me but this one sure did.  The Shining is directed by Stanley Kubrick based the the Stephen King Novel. This is by far one of the scaries movies I have seen.

The movie starts off with beautiful mountain scenery and a car driving towards a location, which we soon found out it is the Overlook Hotel ( The outside shot of the hotel is actually a hotel in Oregon called The Timberline Lodge). The music is scary and it has an inpending doom sound to it.  Jack is there to be  interviewed for a winter caretaker position. He gets the job.  Even after telling him about the tragedy that took place here with the previous caretaker, he still takes the job.

Then we go to a scene at a motel with Shelley Duvall and Danny in Colorado.  Danny has the special ability to shine and his imaginary freind Tony shows him things he does not want to see. When he sees them  he blacks out. Danny can some how see the future and the past which are shown to him by Tony. These scenes are interesting because they actually happened or will happen. This is a great start as to what ""The Shining"" actually means.

Nicolson is already not normal looking so he was perfectly cast for the role.  I don't know why King did not want him. As they enter the hotel and beginn their 5 month isolation from the world strange and bizzare things slowly start to happen. Danny first sees 2 twin girls while playing darts.  They are so freeky and just thinking about then scares me. The girls were the former caretaker Grady daughters. Jack starts to eagerly work on his new book  but is interrupted by Wendy which I think slowly starts his way into going mad or slowly towards a complete breakdown. The hotel seems to be taking over Jack and his own personal demons that he has dealth with and starts to bring them back.  He starts to hallucinate and walks into a bar with a bartender there that offers him a drink. Jack after hitting his son way back when he was a school teacher said he would never drink again yet he does.

Then there is little Danny riding around the hotel in his buggy. The music again is spine tingling. Everytime he turns a corner you get scared because you don't know whats ahead. The scariest part is when he turns yet another corner and encounters the 2 twins. This is the scariest scene in the whole movie!! Danny of course freeks out. Danny knows there is something special about room 237 after he rides by it and tries to open it. But the next time  around in his litle buggy it is open. Again the hotel ghosts doing all this, he enters then we lead up to the next scene. Something happens in that room but we do not know what. Interesting to leave to the imagination.

Jack starts to lose it more as he has dreams of him killing Danny and Wendy, the hotel probably taking over his mind and telling him  what to do, which of course leads Jack back to the  bar again expecially after Wendy accuses him of abusing Danny after Danny walks out to them. Even though somebody in that room caused Danny's bruises.  The hotel brings back Jacks past when he hit Danny and presents it to Wendy now. Now that the hotel or ghosts have made Jack hated by Wendy as to what he supposedly did, he investigates a room where Wendy says someone  tried to strangle Danny completly forgetting about Jack hitting Danny. He of course gets more upset because he thinks he is not doing his job right with someone else in the hotel. Another example of the hotel ""telling"" him he is not doing his job.  Wendy  starts to go a little nuts too. He walks in to the room Wendy told him too and you see a nude woman slowly pullimg out the curtains and walking to him. Now the hotel is testing is loyalty to Wendy. He gives in of course. The scene with the woman is the next scariest scene. The women strats mocking him because ""the hotel"" is making fun of him and how he still cant cope with things.

The hallucinations continue to get more bizzare where he is in a ball room sorrounded  by many people celebrating the 4th Of July. He then bumps into Grady in the bathroom. Grady tells him he needs to correct his family just as he did. He says that Danny and Wendy are preventing him from fullfilling his duties and Danny has a special force and is bringing in help. There is some reincarnation in this movie that I quite don't understand. Grady in the 1920's with a different first name and  Grady in 1970 with a different first name just don't get it. Maybe their souls  were reborn or reincarnated. Jack obviously loses it when he types ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull Boy"" written in his book over and over again. Wendy sees this as she flips through the pages and is convinced her husband has gone mad. Wendy picks up a bat and hits jack and puts him in the freezer room. Grady mocks him again saying that Wendy is stronger than they had thought. Finally Jacks agrees to ""correct the problem"". Danny starts to write redrum backwards on the door with his mothers lipstick. ""Tony"" is within him and his says Redrum in his errie voice over and over again.  His ""special abilities"" tell him again of whats going to happen.  As soon as Wendy wakes up we hear Jack with his big ax trying to get through the door. Little Danny is chased in the big snowy maze by Jack.  The photography in this movie is great some scenes were shot at  different angles. I give this movie 10 stars it makes you think and gets me scared every time I watch it. It is definately a horror masterpiece in my opionion.",1118361600,2,5516,4.3056092843326885

1419149,5,B00005ATQJ,"Love it or hate it, the horror genre never felt the same after Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining."" Adapted, as we all know, from a Stephen King book of the same name, the legendary director of such classics as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Barry Lyndon"" created a picture here that leaves a chill running down your spine long after the credits roll. Too bad King never liked the picture. It's been well documented in the intervening years how the author blamed Kubrick for fundamentally altering his vision. I saw somewhere that King believed that Stanley Kubrick thought his novel was inferior material that needed to be elevated on celluloid. Well, everyone has an opinion. For my part, I don't think Kubrick thought it an unfavorable book even though it is. I read ""The Shining"" and really didn't care for it that much. It is, in fact, one of my least favorite Stephen King novels. Only ""Cujo"" ranks lower--and in that case the film version didn't ride to the rescue. King is a great novelist capable of producing fine work, but long after he is gone people will forget his novel and remember Kubrick's translation. Of course I could be completely wrong, but I don't think so.

The film opens with the Torrance family--father Jack (Jack Nicholson), mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and precocious son Danny (Danny Lloyd)--driving out to the Overlook hotel for the winter. Jack took a job there as the winter caretaker, a big task considering the resort sits high up in the mountains where heavy snowfall virtually assures his family will be snowed in for months. A struggling writer and recovering alcoholic, Jack sees this opportunity as a great way to churn out a novel. It's not as though he has much else to do in the hotel: there aren't any guests loafing about and the staff isn't around to hassle him. All he's got to do is keep the lights and heat on, call in to a ranger station on the radio every few days, and he can sit back and collect a paycheck. Problem is, spending five months cooped up in a hotel in the mountains can bring on a powerful case of cabin fever resulting in...well...bizarre behavior. It happened before at the Overlook, actually, as Jack learns during his job interview with the manager of the hotel. One previous caretaker took an axe and slaughtered his entire family. Fun! Jack doesn't think such a gruesome event will present any problems for him or his family.

Boy, is he mistaken! Jack Torrance has absolutely no idea of the supernatural horrors that lurk in the bowels of the Overlook hotel, but his son Danny does. It seems Danny has the ability to ""shine,"" or read people's thoughts and see things that the rest of us don't see. And what he'll see at the Overlook hotel would give the stoutest among us a massive coronary. Suicides from years past, rivers of blood pouring out of the elevators, and the deceased daughters of the aforementioned caretaker appear as if by magic in front of the terrified Danny. One of the worst horrors resides in room 237, a room a departing employee named Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) tells Danny to avoid like the plague. Hallorann has the ability to shine as well, and is fully cognizant of the powers the Overlook can unleash with ease. As the days turn into weeks, Jack descends into total insanity, terrorizing his stricken wife and son even as he falls under the spell of the spirits in the hotel. There's no sense in dragging this out except to say that the movie unfolds like a relentless, evil dream. ""The Shining"" isn't so much a film as it is an experience to savor--for those who can stand the terror, that is.

Goodness, where to start! The movie fires on every cylinder. Jack Nicholson is sublime as the mentally unbalanced Jack Torrance, capable of menacing subtlety and raging insanity at the drop of a hat. His line ""Hereeee's Johnny"" is arguably one of the best-known movie quotes in the history of cinema. Those who hate the film usually cite Shelley Duvall as the primary reason, claiming her whiny and weak personality mars an otherwise acceptable film. Horse hockey. Duvall is supposed to be in a fragile state largely because of her husband's past history and her concern about her son's odd psychic abilities. And when she sees her family falling apart again, she cracks under the pressure. I think she did fine. As amazing as the performances are, however, they pale in comparison to the look and feel of the film. ""The Shining"" is a cold, detached movie like most other Kubrick films. The dread is a palpable presence in every single frame of the movie, whether we're following Danny's big wheel through the halls of the hotel or watching Jack converse with evil spirits. So many great scenes rise to the forefront of my memory as I write: the chase through the maze, that last soul shattering shot of Jack Torrance, and Wendy's discovery of ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" all exquisitely torture the audience. This is a frightening film, and its one that never loses its impact with subsequent viewings.

The DVD? Surprisingly, we don't get much. The picture quality is quite good, as it should be for a Kubrick film, but extras are lacking. A lengthy documentary about the making of the film with commentary from Kubrick's daughter Vivian does help, yet I can't help but wish for more. I could go on and on about how wonderful a find ""The Shining"" is for the horror fan, but you probably already know all about this film. If you are one of the roughly five people in the world who haven't seen the movie, I pity you. Get out and see it now!",1113350400,49,5554,4.646998982706002
1419150,5,B00005ATQJ,"While watching The Shining (1980) last night, a couple of things were impressed upon me...the first thing is that Shelly Duvall is one creepy looking woman, what with those humongous horse teeth, gigantic peepers, and abnormally large ears (I kept expecting her to say something like `Take me to your leader..').  The other thing is it seems regardless of the scariest, twisted, most frightening, and just generally demented nightmare I could conceive either while sleeping or awake, there will always be someone out there to top it, and even perhaps, commit it to film, as is the case here.  Based on a novel by Stephen King, adapted and directed for the screen by Stanley Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange), the film stars Jack `I like `em young' Nicholson (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), Shelley Duvall (Popeye), and young Danny Lloyd in his first onscreen role.  Also appearing is Benjamin Sherman `Scatman' Crothers (Bronco Billy), Barry Nelson (Airport), Philip Stone (A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon), and Joe Turkel (Blade Runner).

As the film begins we're treated to some amazing shots of snow-capped mountains and lush valleys taken from a helicopter as we follow a car along a winding mountain road.  The scene ends upon a grand, somewhat elegant looking structure we will soon learn is called the Overlook Hotel, an extremely isolated retreat for people who have a lot more money than I do...here we meet Jack Torrance (Nicholson), and he's interviewing for the position of caretaker as the hotel prepares to close its doors for the winter (they need someone to stay on for the five month duration to keep up the place).  Jack's eager to get the job (and he does), as it will allow for him to have the time to work on his writing.  Jack returns with his family, including wife Wendy (Duvall), and their son Danny (Lloyd), along with Danny's imaginary friend Tony (Danny's got some kind of `special' abilities of an extra sensory sort, which tend to channel through his finger, and he' come to know as Tony).  The family settles in, and things seem to be going well enough until Jack begins to develop writer's block along with a touch of the `cabin fever', and a massive snowstorm settles into the area, further isolating the Torrances from the outside world.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, it seems the hotel had some `unpleasantness' in the past as a previous caretaker also suffered a bout of the winter blues (nowadays we'd call it seasonal affective disorder) and did some very nasty things to his family...and then I should probably also mention that the hotel, which was built in the early 1900's, occupies land that used to be Native American burial grounds, obviously without their permission.

I used to read a lot of Stephen King books back in the day, and I've always felt The Shining not only managed to stay pretty close to the source material (keeping and focusing on the important elements), but also reflected much of what made that story so damn scary (the main idea is that psychic activity may not only be inherent in certain individuals, but also places).  Now I know author King disagreed with director Kubrick on a number of things (King wanted someone like Jon Voight or Michael Moriarty instead of Nicholson), but given the thoughtful meticulousness of Kubrick as a director, I'm glad King wasn't able to impress upon Kubrick to alter his vision of how the film should look or play out.  King's a great writer, but his directorial skills leave something to be desired (as displayed in the 1986 bomb Maximum Overdrive, which King took on the directorial reins stating that `If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself'...whatever dude).  The film is filled with wonderful shots featuring interesting angles and unique points of view (the shot with Jack in the freezer, leaning against the door talking to Wendy is inspired) that work amazingly well to foster a sense of claustrophobia in a place that's anything but...some might say the pacing of the film is slow, but I'd characterize it as antagonizing and deliberate, as it takes roughly an hour and 45 minutes before we begin to see the horror appear in more overt forms, specifically Jack becoming more and more unhinged.  This role is characterized as a `signature' role for Nicholson (a role he'll always be known as, much like Voight and the character of Joe Buck or Deniro as Travis Bickle), and while the over the top performances by Nicholson are what gets noticed, watch the quieter scenes for some of the most chilling parts as we see his character desperately struggling to maintain his tenuous grip despite the forces piled against him.  Duvall does an amazing job here, especially the scenes where she has to react as the situation continually deteriorates.  I also thought Danny Lloyd served the film extremely well, helping to create some of the truly shocking and unnerving moments.  Other elements that work so well throughout are the eerie music, the beautiful and elegant sets (the interiors were shot on an English soundstage), and the very realistic dialog featuring many memorable lines.

The picture on this DVD is presented in fullscreen format (1.37:1), which is representative of the aspect ratio of the original camera negative as intended by the director, and the sound comes through clearly in Dolby Digital 5.1.  There are a couple of extras including an original theatrical trailer and a making of featurette by Vivian Kubrick with optional commentary.  Is this the most frightening film I've ever seen?  No...that honor would have to go to The Exorcist (1973), but this one is certainly in the top five, and may cause a sleepless night or two.  By the way, make sure you have a couple of hours before watching this film as it runs nearly two and a half hours, but it's worth it as not a single moment is wasted.

  Jack Nicholson does an awesome job in this movie(what else do you expect from Jack?).  The acting from all of the actors was above par and worth noting.

1419152,5,B00005ATQJ,"This scary movie is not your typical one, but its interesting and compelling all the same. Stephen King's horrific bestseller has not entirely been adapted to the screen, and some of the changes that director Stanley Kubrick makes are strange yet they work all the same. If you read the book, which in my opinion is about equal, then you may not agree. Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall give two glass-breaking, over the top performances but Danny Llyod and Scatman Crothers give two great performances here.

 The film centers around a caretaker, who is watching over the spooky Overlook Hotel in the Rockies for the winter. But what he doesn't know is that the hotel is filled with ghosts, not pleasant ones either. Nicholson slowly begins to lose his mind [although it seems strangely quick on screentime] The ghosts are scary, yet not your traditional transparent things. The camera work, the editing, and just the feel of it all though is what makes this a modern horror classic.

 My advice is to read the book first for better understanding of the story, but never fail to catch this movie alone at night. One thing it never lacks is thrills and spooks! By the way, don't ever watch the horrible 1997 remake, and don't get the titles confused either.

1419157,5,B00005ATQJ,"In my opinion, this is the best ""horror"" film ever made.  However, it is not the conventional horror flick, full of blood guts and gore - and that is why its the best, really.  The directing is superb.  Kubrick is a genius who has no equal.  Every shot of every scene is labored to perfection, like all his movies.  The scares are not shallow make-you-jump scares... they are intense scenes of creepiness that invade your mind, forcing you to think and feel in ways you never want to, but follow nevertheless, out of curiousity and intrigue.  This is the genius of it all.  The best scary movies are not repulsive, they want you to look, to explore, but all the while you ask yourself, why am I following?  No other director can take a script with very little violence (for a horror movie) and very little real action (for a thriller) and deliver the goods almost on the look and feel alone.

Kubrick knows how to scare, he knows what fear really is and he knows how to pick a soundtrack.  This music is downright chilling.  This is a movie I saw for the first time well over ten years ago and ever since certain scenes have never left me... the twins standing in the hallway, Wendy sitting in the bathroom screaming in sheer terror as Jack tears the door down, and room 237.  Who would have thought a scary movie could be made with good acting?  I am not a fan of horror, really, so I don't have a vast knowledge of films made in this genre, but the only other horror film I can think of with real, quality acting was the original Exorcist - another classic.

This is not a movie of cheap thrills.  This is a study of the psyche, an exploration of fear itself.  What terrifies people?  I think Kubrick wanted to get to the heart of true terror by answering that question.  Terror is not an ugly monster and blood and guts.  Terror is the darkness of the mind... the fear of the unknown... it is the loss of stability... the loss of love and familiarity... it is betrayal... vulnerablitly, hoplessness, it is The Shining - which incorporates all of these emotions.",1110412800,3,2064,4.412698412698413

1419170,5,B00005ATQJ,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of both the novel and the 2 film adaptations.  Everyone out there seems to think that you need to hate at least one of these, but I don't.  Certainly, this version doesn't follow the novel closely at all, but this isn't an inherent flaw in the film.  It is what it is, and how closely it follows the source material is really neither here nor there.

That aside, I just watched this movie for the first time in a couple of years, and I was surprised by how well it has held up.  Actually, I definitely like it better now than I ever did before.  Lotsa people, particularly King himself, have criticized this film as being a well-crafted, great looking film with no soul.(A common criticism of Kubrick's films in general, as a matter of fact.)  I think they have something of a point, actually- I don't like any of these characters much, and they are really quite flat and underdeveloped.  But, the striking visual and atmospheric qualities more than make up for a relative like of human interest.

Lots has been made of the changes of the changes that Kubrick made to the general story line of the novel, particularly how the supernatural elements of the story have been downplayed somewhat, and how Jack Torrance is much more imbalanced and hostile from the outset.  I've read a fair bit of analysis/criticism of the film, and come across many laughable interpretations as to why the changes have been made.(Such as the suggestion that the hotel isn't haunted at all, a theory which holds no water whatsoever) Personally, I don't think there really is much of a thematic reason for the changes: Kubrick just needed to condense the story in order for it to fit into a 2 1/2 hour time frame, while adding in a fair number of his own episodes.  More significantly, Kubrick's approach to the material is completely opposite.  Despite the supernatural nature of the story, King's tale emphasized character, using innumerable internal monologues as the characters considered their various plights. Some people seem to act as if the decrease in supernatural activity meant that the psychological depth of the film is greater than in the novel, but this absolutely isn't true. The film version is externally concerned, as we never get to see much into a character other than Jack,(and we still can't really understand why Jack acts as he does) Wendy is reduced to a mere doormat, who rarely says anything more than bland pleasantries and platitudes, while Danny rarely says or does much of anything at all. I actually think this is necessary for the sorta of mood Kubrick seemed to be trying to achieve.  The film is icy, and inhuman- having warm, full human characters would reduce that feeling.  The film doesn't really seem concerned with how or why things happen, but simply on how they are shot.  This is definitely a valid approach,  and the film manages to have genuine amount of discomfort at pretty much all times, even when not a whole lot is actually going on.

As with virtually all of my favorite horror movies, `The Shining' has stunning music and visuals.  The music is largely avant-garde classical stuff, from Ligeti and Bartok and others.  It's not the sorta thing I'd likely enjoy listening to it by its self, and it used to rather annoy me, but it's quite startlingly effective during the film.  I particularly like the song used during the opening scenes.  ""Dies Irae' I think it is.  Visually, this isn't quite like anything else I've ever seen.  It was made shortly after the creation of the steadicam, and Kubrick apparently fell in love with this new apparatus, illustrated by the near perpetual use of tracking shots.(If anyone ever moves from one part of the hotel to another, you can rest assured that you will get to see them walking there.)  I'm not really sure why the steadicam was used to  extensively, but it really works, establishing a visual motif to the film, and giving us a sense of the size and isolation of the Overlook, as well as illustrating the monotony of life their via numerous similar camera angles/movements.  That, and I just think that smooth, steadicam shots are, well, cool.

`The Shining' has quite a few powerful images, even if some of them don't really seem to be here of there.  The famed blood-flood coming out of the elevator in slow-motion is extremely cool, and actually kinda creepy, I think.  The twin girls are quite creepy  as well, particularly when Danny sees them in the game room, and they somehow manage to seem to be floating, only semi-corporeal.  His final encounter with them is quite stunning as well, particularly the tight tracking shot of him rolling through the surreal, dollhouse corridors of the hotel.(Though there `scary ghost voices' don't quite work)  The final chase is quite excellent and nightmarish as well.(The hedge maze is very cool in general, as a matter of fact)  The absolute best shot would have to be just after Jack here Danny scream in the kitchen, and rises up from below the frame, nastily grinning.  Sadly, the encounter in 237 is totally botched.  It's just.... stupid, for the most part.  Kinda gross, no doubt, but pretty silly and it hurts the atmosphere of the film as a whole. But, the rest of the film is good enough that  it doesn't matter.

The acting is more than competent, though nobody other than Jack Nicholson really does all that much.  Nicholson's performance is generally loved or loathed, but I come down somewhere in the middle.  He's pretty damn over the top much of the time, but well, he IS supposed to be crazy, ya know, and some of his other scenes are a bit more nuanced than many of the critics would have you believe.  He's definitely entertaining, and quite menacing at times, particularly in the very last act, after the main encounter in their apartment.

Well, that's it.  Definitely one of my 10 favorite horror films.  I'd recommend you read the novel first, partially because I like it a lot, partially because the movie likely won't make a whole helluva lot of sense to someone who hasn't read it.",1108252800,3,6061,4.720532319391635

Is The Shining a good movie?  Sure it is.  It's a great movie if you put the book aside and forget it's supposed to be based off the book.  In it's own right, it is a good film.  But for the book... it really isn't all it's cracked up to be.

To put it simply, the movie doesn't really follow the book all that well.  It's almost an original film.  That shouldn't suggest it's a bad film though.  As I said, in its own right it's a farily good film.  But if you really do want to compare it to the book, you'll find yourself disappointed.

Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a man who is hired to be a caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during the harsh winter.  But there's a history behind the hotel that only those gifted with ""The Shining"" know.  And only Jack's son Danny really knows.

The movie actually is easy to understand (some reviewer said it wasn't) if you actually watch the film.  It really is one of those movies that if you stick with it, your questions will be answered.  Although, there are some moments from the book I wish they would've included.  For example, Danny's ""Shining"" isn't explained very well, and the movie never actually touches base with where the Overlook's employees go on their time off. Somwhere along the lines one of the characters winds up in Miami but the movie never tells you why he's there (or that he actually ever went). The book explains everything.  One should not have to wonder why a character is where they are... especially if the character runs off to a different state without so much as a word or picture from the director.

There are other little things that can be buggy about the film.  A kid has an ""imaginary"" friend named Tony.  He says Tony lives in his mouth, but the movie shows us that Tony is his finger.  I won't go on to tell you more about the book, but that already doesn't make much sense.  That and REDRUM doesn't really play any significance in the movie the way it did in the book.

Now at first I thought I was going to hate this movie, but there was some saving grace: When Jack goes insane and tries to kill his family.

The moment Jack starts talking to Lloyd, the bartender (who is actually a ghost) the movie starts to pick up, and you forget it's supposed to be based off a book.  This is because Jack Nichelson really gets into the part and finally starts to do some acting.

The entire chase between Danny and his father is perhaps the most memorable moment in the movie.  There are other memorable parts as well.  Take the moment when Jack smashes though the door, pokes his head in and says ""Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeere's Johnny!""  It's a classic line.

The movie is also scary.  Is it as scary as the book?  Not by a long shot!  The book was perhaps the scariest piece of fiction I've ever read, but the movie doesn't hit that level.

Really, if you forget it's supposed to be based off the classic novel by Stephen King then you will love this movie!  But if you're a purist of the book, you'll quickly find yourself hating the movie fast.  Luckily, I'm not a purist, only someone who likes to compare.

In it's own right, it's a good film.  When compared to the book; it's woozy and neglects to explain or touch base with anything.  It's well directed and scripted, but sometimes it seems to forget that there is an audience who will want answers to questions.

Some critics have argued that Kubrick's films are too clinical and can leave the audiences somewhat detached, but I guess that's up to the beholder.

1419177,5,B00005ATQJ,"During the period of the late 70s and early 80s, several slasher horror movies were released, such as Friday the 13th, but The Shining generates its horror through psychological means which keeps the viewer guessing throughout the movie.

Using a script based on the novel by Stephen King, director Stanley  Kubrick has created a story with menacing settings and excellent performances by Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd.  Nicholson stars as Jack Torrance, who's come to the Overlook Hotel as the off-season caretaker.  Duvall plays his wife Wendy, and Lloyd stars as the Torrance's son Danny.

At his interview, Jack is told about a former caretaker named Delbert Grady, who murdered his wife and two daughters.  Soon, Jack is experiencing his own psychological changes.  The Overlook soon becomes Jack's personal playground of terror as Wendy and Danny are forced to fight for their lives against Jack.  Will they survive, or will Jack succeed in killing them as Delbert Grady did to his family?

This is an excellent movie.  Nicholson's performance is first-rate, and his ""Here's Johnny!"" line has become legendary.  Shelley Duvall does a fine job as the scared wife, and Danny Lloyd's performance of Danny, who has psychological powers, is very good as well.  I highly recommend this thrilling and scary film.

It is a story about a novelist and his family who are invited to stay at this giant hotel in the mountains, so he can write his book in piece in guiet. When he gets there, the owner tells him about a story of a man who once stayed there and went crazy and decided to kill his family. He also informed him that the hotel is quite haunted as well. Not believing the place was haunted or anything,he and his family stay there anyway. After about a month there,they soon realize that the place really is cursed and strage things start to happen.

1419190,4,B00005ATQJ,"Between the spooky writing of Stephen King and the eerie direction of Stanley Kubrick it is hard to tell who made this movie scarier but it is a must for horror fans.

Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a writer in search of a quiet place to sit down and finish his novel so he interviews for a winter solstice as a caretaker for a remote resort in the Colorado mountains. In tow is his fragile wife (Shelley Duvall) and susceptible son (Danny Lloyd). The resort is filled with old haunted tales and legends so it becomes inevitable that something will be lurking behind those scary bushes! Jack settles into life as a writer but soon suffers from a bout of writer's block or is it something else? His frustration shows up in irritated bouts of abuse directed towards his family. His wife, Wendy, seems to slip lower and lower on the totem pole and becomes a shell of her former self as she tries her best to avoid angering her volatile husband with wicked eyebrows and an ever present smirk on his face. Meanwhile their son, Danny, spins about the hotel on a bigwheel and discovers all sorts of little secrets lurking in the rooms, a pair of spooky twin ghosts, blood soaked walls and a maze of manicured shrubs. Redrum, redrum.....beware!!

There is always something unsettling about Stanley Kubrick's pictures and this film is pretty creepy. I must admit I never read Stephen King's novel but it is my understanding that Kubrick took it upon himself to change a few things resulting in a riff between the two artists. Regardless this film will remain a classic thriller despite succumbing to a recent remake. Jack Nicholson is downright terrifying in this film and Shelley Duvall becomes his squealing victim. Pulling some fantastic creepy performances out of nowhere are the young Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers who both manage to add a few eerie scenes to their bag of tricks.

  Danny Lloyd is very good as Danny Torrance. His facial expressions when he ""shines"" is good. Good acting for a 7 year-old. The Grady girls scene is awesome too, it represents the evil of the hotel. Jack is the best, sexiest, amazing actor ever!!!!!!!!!

  Shelley Duvall has the personality for movies but not the physical characteristics. Not exactly the prettiest woman. She plays a good frightened house wife Wendy, who scared of her own spouse.

  Scatman Courothers is a good actor too, he has a good personality for Halloren, the chef.

  Jack plays a wonderful, breath-taking performance of a crazed physico man. It's amazing who he turns from ""I had the most terrible dream, I kill you and Danny."" Then sobs. To ""Heeeeeeeer'es Johnny and WANTS to kill them.

1419193,5,B00005ATQJ,"If you want to really understand Stanley Kubrick's artistic vision and unique visual style that has made him such so admired, this may be a good movie to start with.

I will not elaborate on the plot, which you can read in the editorial review. The ""Horror"" angle of the story isn't very interesting to me, just another typical Stephen King story. However Kubrick manages to create unique atmosphere, haunting and chilly, which slowly builds up through his slow and hypnotic shots of the house. The giant mansion is the real hero of the film. Kubrick shapes the house with odd colors and lightings, much like in clockwork orange, but where in Clockwork orange it was a mere quirky abstraction here it manages to reflect the inner moods of the main character- ""All work and no play"" loony Jack Nicholson, and propels the atmosphere of insanity slowly building.

(Notice the use of lighting- throughout the movie there always some kind of strong light in the center of the screen, making an effect of surrealism.)

It's also Jack Nicholson greatest performance, and there's a lot of humor in his amusing insane expressions.

This movie shows that Kubrick's odd choice at making a horror film wasn't in vain, and might be his greatest achievement, especially in terms of visuals.

1419195,5,B00005ATQJ,"Will anyone ever forget the phrase ""All work and no play make Jack a dull boy""? It should have been, ""All thrills and no faithfulness to the novel make Stephen a pissed author.""

Kubrick's expert crafting of shocker-films has been well known for years; we know this from 'Clockwork Orange,' already. But as far as book ADAPTATIONS, ""The Shining"" is a failure. This is not to say, however, that ""Shining"" is a poorly made FILM.

First off, the sets and location for the Overlook Hotel could not have made more perfect marks on the scare-scale. Particularly the scene (which will definitely turn your insides) where Jack ventures into the mystery room, and meets the hag in the bathtub, is brilliantly suspenseful. Climactic moments that rely on the sets are the maze chase between Jack and his PSI-cursed son, and the corresponing sub-scene where Duvall becomes lost in the haunted manor and encounters the infamous elevator lobby. FYI, the Overlook's snowbound exteriors were filmed on location in an actual Colarado residence. Interiors, however, were constructed sound-sets.

What Scatman Crothers was doing in a flick like this is beyond me, but Nicholson and Duvall along with the undercredited son Lloyd, show true talent, and dish out the chills and thrills with the slight of a stroke of lipstick (((REDRUM))).

Nicholson's hacking of the bathroom door with his axe is one of the most memorable cinematic moments brought to the big-screen,(""HEEEEERRRE'S JOHNNY!"") and audiences everywhere are still screaming.

Finally, one can thank the gore department for keeping in balane with the plotline. Moments to watch for here, folks, are Danny's delusional trike ride down the hotel corridors, the bathtub scene, and of course, the death of Crothers' character.

If you don't jump out of your seat to go throw up, you'll at least get some serious goosebumps and chills. Kubrick's knack with freaking us out was alive then, and isn't dead yet.

As for the bad news, Stephen King fans will abandon the feature before the first twenty minutes. 'Carrie' holds truer to it's book than this one. But whoever said book-to-movie projects were easy, guys? Give Stan a break, please. The plotline is of course, dramatically simplified, but that's half the fun. Those who haven't read the novel--like myself--probably won't throw thier popcorn at the TV as hard as King-fanatics may.

Like I said, it'll scare the living hell out of it's viewer, maybe even cause you hide all sharp objects from your hubby for safety. If your like classic nightmare-inducing thrillers, and enjoy the talent of Jack Nicholson, you've met your match. Get it, Wendy?!

1419196,5,B00005ATQJ,"I have never come across such a gripping and well made film in my life. Sure there are a number of fantastic films out there, but when you think of them being 'well made' you realize that some are not as good as they seem. Such as Scarface it deserves 5 stars, but in terms of acting talent (other than Pacino) it is poor and the  use of the camera cannot compete with the Shining, I don't think any film can compete in terms of the crispness of directing, I love the irregularity of the camera angles which typified Kubrick as a masterclass in directing, Scarface is still a fantastic film but in terms of making it good to look at - it sort of fails, but then there came The Shining, adapted from a fantastic Stephen King novel the film is a wierd tale, Jack Nicholson superbly plays Jack Torrance the winter caretaker of a hotel high in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, he is up there with his wife and his son. His son (played very well by a young Danny Lloyd) has an unusual talent, the shining.

 As the story unfolds, Jack begins to lose his mind as he is haunted by the horror of murders past and it ends in a crescendo of which he tries to kill his family. Can the Shining be used to save their lives, well it is and as Jack finds out and is influenced by theinvisible evils in the place he goes completely bonkers and is intent on a murderous rampage that will leave his family sorry. It has a grim ending and it is very tense because you don't think that the wife and son will getaway due to them being snowbound and isolated from the world.

 I don't think any other film anywhere has ever had so many memorable quotes nor do I think there is any other style of directing that could beat this, it is in a class of its own. Stanley Kubrick relly brings the chills and creates more suspense than you can handle, the eerie climate made is just another thing that adds to the terror and with Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Philip Stone and Scatman Crothers it is clear the film will stun and it does, it is one o the best films ever made due to the fact it has been concentrated on and developed sublimely before being given to the masses.

1419197,5,B00005ATQJ,"Wow is this movie good.

Anyone that has read the book the shining will notice small and sequence changes between the book story and the movie story.  However I, as a person that has read the book, don't feel like the movie let the story down by making slight plot changes.  Infact i feel like kubric did a good job of adding and adjusting parts of the plot to make the story more appealing on screen.  Several differences between the movie and book are 1) jack torrances charachter.  In the book, Jack Torrance , who is the caretaker of the hotel, is a family loving man who has done wrong in the past but is trying to change.  He interperets the actions in his life that he has done as nothing but natural reactions to ""wasp stings"" as he calls them, which are basically what society has done to him and has forced him to react badily upon.  Such as when he breaks his sons arm he feels like it wasn't really his fault he was forced to do it because of his sons bad behavior ""wasp stings"". In the book Jack Torrance is a family loving man with remorse for what he does.. however in the movie Jack Torrance is shown to be a lunatic with no real reasons for his anger and his bad temperment.  This change i felt was intelligently done by kubric.  Rather than having the hotel serve as the monster(and the possesed one), Kubric turns Jack Torrance's charachter into that.  The result of this is plenty of action and drama into a story whos book version failed miserably towards the ending. Also the ending of the movie story is different than the book story.  The shining is filled with plenty of action and excitement, and most of all the plot is done well.  I was not scared by the movie, however don't take that as a bad thing because i rarely if ever get scared watching a horror movie.  Jack Nicholson was absolutely brilliant in this movie and he really made it into the classic that it was.. I cant imagine anyone else playing his part.  I loved this movie the action and even some humor was brilliant.  The old woman tub scene was pretty close to any scare that i got in the movie.. she reminds me of the charachter zelda in pet semetary, but worse..if you can believe that.

Nonetheless, the movie still has a lot to offer and and lures us into locked-in horror. Briliant camerawork let the viewer see the way Daniel does the haunted hotel.

1419205,5,B00005ATQJ,"""The Shining"" was an interesting choice for director Stanley Kubrick to tackle.  Generally, when you think of Kubrick's choices they deal with larger themes and you would not think that he would engage himself in a discredited genre such as horror.  When this film was released in 1980 to lukewarm critical and audience reaction, some feel he didn't engage himself in it very well.  What is this film? Is it horror? Is it dark comedy? A hybrid of both? To my mind, whatever it is or whatever Kubrick intended it to be it works.  The movie is about Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson), a blocked writer, who takes a job as a caretaker at an isolated mountain resort for the winter with his wife, Wendy(Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny(Danny Lloyd) in tow.  As the onset of winter presents itself, the pressures mount on Jack and he starts to slowly go beserk by seeing things real or imagined and decides to turn on his family.  Now, alot of people point out that Nicholson telegraphed his insanity early in the film by playing his character broadly from the get go.  But considering the demands that Kubrick put on his actors I believe this was purely intentional.  Duvall also gives a frenzied performance, but legend has it that she was a sensitive soul who cracked under the pressure that Kubrick exerted.  The Overlook hotel set also works as a character in the film, with it's long hallways and cavernous rooms used to terrific effect.  The snow-covered exteriors and in particular the hedge maze that was created for the film enhance the horror.  Stephen King was on record as saying that he despised this film, that Kubrick gutted his novel.  He so disliked this film that he approved a made-for-television adaptation that stuck more closely to his book.  I've read ""The Shining"" and found it more silly than scary.  I think this film has held up remarkably well and that Kubrick made the correct choices.",1097193600,9,1907,4.739393939393939

1419207,5,B00005ATQJ,"Okay, for starters, ignore both of the 'star' reviewers.

The Shining is not availible in wide screen, because it was not filmed in wide screen.  Neither were Eyes Wide Shut or Full Metal Jacket.  When they are shown wide screen in theatres, the top and bottom have been truncated.

And as if it has not been stated enough, this movie doesn't follow the book.  Everyone always states that as if it is so surprising.  There is a great story about Kubrick calling up Stephen King at 3 am and asking him 'Do you believe in God' and when King said yes, Kubrick said 'I thought so' and hung up.

Why is this significant?  Every change that Kubrick made was to totally remove the religious conscience that hides behind the words in the book.  Kubrick presents us with an entirely atheistic and amoral film where Jack Torrence never comes around to save his son's life, and in his typical manner he heavily deletes details to make the story ambigious.  He also down plays the supernatural element (for example, instead of having hedge animals come to life, (which is sort of stupid) he instead has Jack chase Danny through a hedge maze.  It sounds at first as if it wouldn't be as interesting, but it is a very effective scene)  I do not recommend ever reading any of the books that Kubrick based his films on; just like with Hitchcock, he was very good at taking a hack writer and producing a great film from it.  (Verdi excelled at this also, only not films)  Also it is to your best interest to laugh a lot when you watch this film.  It is one of the funniest movies ever, and if you don't appreciate the humor, you'll never be scrared of the film.  (The scene in the car, where Jack tells Danny that he should have eaten his breakfast is an absolute classic)  Also, unlike every other horror movie in the world, this one gets scarier the more you watch it.

As for the comments about the removal of material from the book explaining the images, see 2001 A Space Odyssey.  Kubrick enjoyed finishing his films, and then drastically cutting them.  We are accustomed to having every detail explained to us, and Kubrick doesn't do that.  He doesn't feel it's necessary to make us understand how and why all of these things happen.  An interesting note: the average ratio of film shot to film kept for a film is about 1:5 to 1:10.  For the shining it was something like 1:250... meaning for every 250 reels of film Kubrick shot, he kept one.  Realize that when you watch it; every single shot is exactly as he wanted it.  Also, in the words of Stephen King, Kubrick liked to make films that hurt people--it's a very good observation",1095811200,17,2623,4.4831223628691985
1419208,2,B00005ATQJ,"The first time I ever saw Kubrick's film The Shining I was in middle school watching it with my sister late into the night. Circumstances as they were the movie terrified me. It takes advantage of the idea that catastrophic events leave an imprint on the places they occurred. The idea was so intriguing that I became fascinated by the film itself. Now, in college, I decided to revisit the Overlook by reading the book. After reading the novel I understand completely why Stephen King disliked Kubrick's adaptation. I found myself wondering how the screen play even came from King's novel.

  The film gives no background about Jack's troubling history, aside from him accidentally injurying Danny. Jack's character has so much depth that is not explored in the film. Granted, Jack Nicholson must be given credit for his portrayal of Jack Torrance. Nicholson has the ability to take a weak script and develop a character that is tantalizingly mad.

  The most frustrating point in the film is at the end when Wendy is running through the hotel and is confronted by many of its images. The history of these images is addressed in the book but there is no precedent for them in the movie. I understand that it is impossible to include all of the details in any novel in a cinematic adapation, but to present them as random images is confusing to the audience. Other unnecessary changes made in the screenplay include the hedge maze (in the novel the Overlook is actually guarded by animal topiaries) and a major change in the outcome of Jack's insanity.

 Now, not to be disrespectful to Mr. Kroll, nor indeed to belittle the movie itself (over which I am about to wax lyrical), but he seems to have forgotten William Friedkin's seminal meisterwork ""The Exorcist"", released some seven years previous, and before that, Bela Lugosi's throbbing, heaving, sexual, meaty 1931 performance as Dracula, in the movie of the same name.

 But if that was the first epic horror movie, and ""Exorcist"" the second, then Kubrick's ""The Shining"" comes a very, VERY close third, and in many ways, beats those other masterpiece works of cinema at their own game.

 First of all, ""The Shining"" is based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, but is not altogether similar to the book, so to satisfy the book-lovers amongst us (myself included, a teriffic read and one of King's unequivocal best) I'll just say this: the film version of ""The Shining"" is one of those joyfully rare things where the novel loses nothing in the translation. In fact, thanks to the Screenplay's omission of several key-to-the-Novel vignettes (hedge animals, boiler, Jack's alcoholism) the movie production is able to concentrate on an altogether more frightening angle: without any apparent character deficiency or flaw, Jack Torrance is subverted anyway, to the same grisly ends, by the malevolent Hotel. It makes for a compelling comparison - in the book, Jack's troubled psyche is present ever before he sets foot in the Overlook, but here in the movie, the power of the Hotel is such that it can take a normal, angry man and turn him to... ...things. Unencumbered by such character exploration and explanation, (which works exquisitely well in the novel, a counterpoint, if you will, to the madness of Overlook Jack), Kubrick (Rest In Peace, you deserve it!) is able to weave a magnificent and nightmarish story out of the simplest, most mundane of threads, and creates in the movie a Monster which is all the more terrifying because of his apparent normalcy.

 Now, to synopsise the plot: Jack and Wendy Torrance, and their psychic son Danny, move to the Overlook Hotel in Colorado for the winter. Jack's the new winter caretaker and, looking forward to having lots of quiet time and isolation to get on with his new Novel, he begins to go slowly insane, while Danny begins to notice more and more the creeping evil contained within the Overlook. To say more is to spoil it, but trust me, it's worth every damn second of screen time.

 Performance-wise, we have Jack Nicholson playing Jack Nicholson, but here it works oh-so-perfectly-well. The indefinable sense of rage and malevolence he radiates during the scenes where he is watching Wendy and Danny through the lobby windows, and the yowling Baby Jane-esque mania of the movie's final reel bear all the hallmarks of truly great acting. We believe that this is Jack Torrance, we believe that he is evil, and we believe that he is subjected to all manner of psycho-supernatural abuse by the malevolent hotel. He is, in short, perfectly cast in his role, and gives one of his finest performances in ""The Shining"". In her role as Wendy, Shelley Duvall is a light, a wonderful actress portraying with scalpel precision the frailty and ignorant fear of a woman caught in the middle. Her portrayal of Wendy is as accomplished as it is endearing, and of the three main leads in the picture, hers is the most developed character - the contrast between placid, sweet Wendy at the start of the movie and the unhinged, terrified end-Wendy is brought about by Duvall's exquisite ability to showcase a broad range of believable emotion in a relatively short amount of screen time. Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance is excellent, the much-parlayed 'Redrum' scene is a gem, and he is perfectly believable as the psychic Kid with the weight of the World (or at least, the weight of the Overlook) on his small shoulders.

 The Direction is what sets ""The Shining"" apart, but with a genius like Kubrick at the helm, what can we expect? It's like music; the staccatto, stark interior shots of the monochromatic lobby interior and sterile kitchen make for the most terrifying visual contrast with the dream-like, expansive opening sequence, and the snowy, winter-wonderland exterior scenes provide the absolute sense of isolation that the Torrence family must indeed be feeling.

 Musically, I don't believe I have ever seen a film scored more perfectly. Shades of Max Steiner (Mildred Pierce and Now, Voyager) abound as the jangling violins and human-like guttural bellows create an ideal and perfect aural accompaniment to the already ideal visual.

 I can't rave enough about this masterful, terrifying and altogether absorbing piece of work. It must be owned and watched, and that is all.

1419225,5,B00005ATQJ,"Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING (1980) is a cinematic marvel. Visually stunning, emotionally disturbing, it throws everything at you but the kitchen sink---and purposely attempts to explain almost nothing. Kubrick directed this filmic adaptation of the Stephen King bestseller with his finetoothed artistic brush; his genius as a director always coming from his genius as a photographer. However, this didn't stop his film from raising a firestorm of controversy ever since Kubrick began principal photography in 1979. Starting with the author himself, Stephen King was most displeased over the immense amount of changes Kubrick made to his story. When the movie was finally finished and released in 1980, it received cheers & jeers in roughly equal amounts, from critics to Stephen King fans.
I can see both sides to the controversy. What Stanley Kubrick made was a film *based on* the book of the same name, not a film version of the book itself. Although I believe that most people wrongfully assume that a film treatment of a book *has to* be faithful to it, I will agree that Kubrick changed more than what is normal for a book-to-screen adaptation. In doing so, he crafted a movie that was radically different from the novel. On the other hand, many of Kubrick's changes were for the better, the most notable of them being the hedge maze replacing the hedge animals from the book. Besides the fact that the latter would have been really hard to film back in 1979-80, the former added a new dimension of space, shape and horror to the proceedings. It was made effectively creepy and, of course, with the way Kubrick photographs, gave us a real sense of the vulnerability of the Torrance family, being all alone in the middle of a snow-covered nowhere.
Then there is the acting---brilliant, just brilliant. Jack Nicholson, who had already established himself as one of the most important actors of our time with his very well-deserved 1975 Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of faux-mentally disturbed Randall P. McMurphy in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, here as Jack Torrance created an equally memorable character that has also been enshrined in movie immortality. Shelley Duvall brings an intensity to Wendy Torrance that was perhaps under-emphasized in the book. Six-year-old Danny Lloyd, in his debut to his very brief film career (he would only do one other film after this one), is compulsively watchable as five-year-old Danny Torrance and completely commands our attention every time he's onscreen. Finally, 70-year-old Scatman Crothers as head cook Dick Hallorann, who shares the terrible gift of clairvoyance with Danny, gives what is probably the most memorable performance in his long and distinguished career.
Yes, there are flaws, most notably the fact that Jack Torrance is made to go off the wall too soon into the film. In the book, it was a gradual incorporation of the hotel's evil spirit; perhaps too slow, but in the movie it happens so fast that we don't get any time to actually *sympathise* with his plight. But the film works on so many visual levels that it can be forgiven for its lack of character development. Be forewarned about showing this to your kids: THE SHINING is a rare phenomenon in that it's much bloodier and gorier than the book; usually it's the other way around with Stephen King books. THE SHINING may not be perfect, but it is nevertheless a Horror classic, a Stanley Kubrick classic and a Jack Nicholson classic---and it leaves us with a final shot that is as haunting as it is thought-provoking.

Reading the reviews here is a clue to what makes The Shining so special.  Most of the negative posters seem bored by the movie (as well as unable to spell or construct a complex sentence).  It's not a movie for children or those with a child's attention span. One example: the scene where Jack and the hallucinated bartender have their first conversation lasts for over five minutes; we keep waiting for some sort of shocker (e.g. the bartender turns around and has no face, or something like that).  Instead,  Kubrick keeps the scene disturbingly normal, brilliantly allowing Jack's delusional paranoia to feed on itself, which of course is the real horror of the movie.  This kind of patience and craft is lost on those used to more pedestrian gorefests, but for those who appreciate subtlety and humor along with sheer mounting terror, it's just one high spot in a movie filled with them.",1082678400,4,998,4.807017543859649

I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13, and sharing the same name as the boy in the film, it is little wonder why this movie scared the life out of me!  The style of the film, with its minimalistic use of music and the cinematographer's use of wide-angle shots to give a sense of open space, make for an interesting experience.  Not to mention this movie has ""Jack.""  I once heard that Stephen King hated this rendition of his popular novel, but I think that the story is more visceral and terrifying without the overdose of the supernatural that his novel is prone to.  This film is a ghost story by film's end, but a journey into madness along the way. There are some over-the-top moments meant to invoke terror.  Like the ""Here's Johnny!"" scene, or when Danny is riding through the halls on his big-wheel and turns a corner to find twin girls staring at him and chanting, ""Come and play with us, Danny.  You can play with us forever...and ever...and ever...""  But some are simply too much to swallow.  Like Shelley Duvall running through the hotel looking for her son and encountering all the hauntings.  Of those scenes, only one works.  It's the scene when the elevator opens in slow-motion and blood flows from the compartment filling the hallway.  Anyway, if you love Jack, then this movie is essential viewing.  An interesting side-note: I watched this film again recently and I found myself looking at the film from Jack's perspective instead of the little boy's.  I found that to be equally unsettling.

I like fright films and hoped that the Shining would equal or surpass the Haunting as the quintessential thinking mans horror.
Instead we got a Jack Nicholson movie.
I think Nicholson is one of the best if not THE best actor of my time and I enjoy his performance here but do you see what happened - the focus shifted to the films star because the directors performance went flat.
I was amazed that Kubrick chose to flat out show you the ""horrors"" instead of suggest them which would have enabled them to grow dimensionally in the imagination of the viewer. Maybe some people find those little girls disturbing or the gallons of blood but if you don't where else can you go?
The atmosphere was more institutional feeling than frightening and that silly voice repeating ""redrum"" ( an asinine devise old as the hills - spelling a key word backwards ) actually made me laugh.

1419235,2,B00005ATQJ,"This review is going to be a metaphor for the movie, in that the title has little to do with the content, it's overly long, it's repetitive, and people are going to be divided as to whether it's great or just a complete waste of time and talent.

So what's the film about? Is it Jack's slow descent into madness? Well, no, he's a psycho from the start, evinced by Wendy saying in such an obviously ominous way that he once dislocated his son's shoulder in anger. Indeed, his manic grin and arched eyebrows don't become more manic and more arched as the film progresses - it is obvious from the film's opening scenes that he is going snap and try to kill his family. Resultingly, there is no tension whatsoever.
Is it, therefore, about a would-be author suffering writer's block? Well, no, because he spends months writing the exact same words - not the actions and frustrations of a blocked writer, but the behaviour of a psycho. And, again, the frustrations don't develop - all the knobs are turned up to max throughout, so there is no sense of impending disaster.
So is it about a family that falls apart at the seams? Well, no, because the family is never really a family to begin with, so there is no frame of reference - the family is dysfunctional from the offing.
Then is it about a child's burgeoning psychic abilities? Well, no, because other than seeing a couple of ghosts, which both his father and his mother can do, and talking in a silly voice, it adds absolutely nothing to the plot, short of giving it a title and using it to provide a body for Jack to axe.
Therefore it must be about a haunted hotel, right? Well, by now, you probably don't even care, but I'm going to keep going anyway, just as the film does, on and on and on. It's about a haunted hotel in the same way that Ghost Ship is about a ghost ship - an excuse for a couple of cheap thrills and low-brow special effects in an attempt to be `scary'. And, like Ghost Ship, Stanley Kubrick missed the concept that `horror' relies upon a sense of dread based upon the human fear of what lies out of sight - the darkness at the end of the passageway, the malevolence that watches from the shadows - and not upon a couple of people in period costume who we assume must be dead.
Now I have to add a sprinkling of pretension, because we find that in every Kubrick film: The movie's lack of inherent humanity, its stale motifs and soporific pace leading to a sudden orgy of Dionysian extravagance, fail to believably convey the essence of a human being struggling to maintain a thread of sanity amidst a vision of dystopianism and an overriding sense of ennui. The symbolism of the empty hotel reflecting the yearning loneliness of the soul that is the human condition, far from validating its own position, serves merely to strengthen the apathetic interactions between the viewer and the screen. The movie therefore acts as the antithesis to its own goals, failing to engage the individual while attempting to elucidate a universal notion of the individual's concept of Self in relation to Other. Furthermore, its utilisation of dichotomies - sane/insane, reality/fantasy, natural/supernatural - fail to resonate upon any level beyond the visual.
If you want a scary, haunted house horror, the original version of The Haunting, based on the Shirley Jackson novel that inspired King and others, is the definitive 20th Century haunted-house-as-basis-for-psychological-thriller. If you want a Kubrick film in which his detached style adds to the plot, rather than detracting from it, watch Full Metal Jacket. If you want a film that puts a human face on trying to keep a family together amidst the supernatural, watch Stir Of Echoes. And if you want to watch a film about a guy who goes psycho in a place of geographical isolation, Dead Calm is a must-see.
And now that that's over, to maintain my metaphor of the film, I need to end this review and leave you feeling unsatisfied, confused, and a little annoyed: Frank Sinatra sang about flying to the moon, but he died. The end.",1076284800,13,4047,4.620833333333334
1419236,1,B00005ATQJ,"This film has ONLY two things going for it. Kubrick meets Nicholson and the advent of the award winning cinematography technology - Stedicam. True Kubrick fans will agree that this is a highly overrated, undernourished, ill-plotted and inapt adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Even Stephen King agrees with that! The film is marred by an intolerably sluggish beginning and middle act that is supposed to build up to an all out finale of mad proportions. The truth is that it had all been done before in 1979 in an equally as well known film called - The Amityville Horror.
The premise is simple. Husband, wife and kid move to a hotel for a snowy winter. Kid has the gift of the second sight, wife is just your average stereotypical ""nicey nice"" housewife, husband is working at the hotel to keep it running while the owners and the guests are away. He is also writing a book. The hotel turns out to be haunted. This slowly drives the husband insane. He then tries to kill his family with an axe and the wife and kid freak out of it in the process.
The Amityville Horror is the original ""mad family axe man"" movie. It is also the original mad family axe man novel! Both novel and film precede King and Kubrick's vision of the exact same theme, except here you have a hotel that is haunted instead of a house. No points for originality there. You would do the original owners of this theme a great disservice by giving it to Kubrick and King instead.
The entire film looks great because of the fluid Stedicam work that goes up the stairs, down the hall, and into every nook and cranny seamlessly. Nicholson does a great job of going insane and then absolutely crackers in the end. Everything else in this film is utterly tedious material that will try your patients to the very last thread. Kubrick did all of his ""one million takes"" to get that shot. Okay he got the shot, but he forgot entirely about the script and what makes a movie tick. We could say that it is all about the performances - but let us look at that more closely. The kid in this movie says very little and just usually looks scared or intrigued by something, but that is it. Shelley Duvall is the most clichd driven character you will ever see. She does little more than attend to Nicholson's every demand in the most sterile of performances that ends up with her doing a lot of screaming. Obviously everybody was made to look dull in this film so that Nicholson's raving lunatic would eclipse their roles. Unfortunately Kubrick should have gone further and got Nicholson's performance to eclipse the entire movie. It goes nowhere near transcending the banality of its 143 minutes. The last 30 minutes is all insanity and chasing the family around with an axe. The other 113 minutes is sheer nothingness as people see a few ghosts and just visit places in the hotel. Nowhere does this film work itself out to excuse almost two hours of its pretentious, exaggerated, hollow setup - and that is all those two hours are. It is a big setup of the hotel, its haunted parts, more areas of the hotel and the family staying together in solitary.
Don't by into the flamboyant grandiose big names that went along with this abhorrence of storytelling. The ending, which this whole movie is based on, does absolutely nothing to justify the rest of it. When you sit through this thing from start to finish you will see through its phoniness for what it is. When you couple that with the fact that it is a rip-off, it only lowers everything even more. That is why I give this a 1 star rating.
As a fan of the genre this DVD goes where it should belong. Among the other awful direct to video horror movies that gather dust at the back of the shelf as testimony to the great horror films that sit in front of them for regular viewing and cover polishing.",1073692800,12,3808,4.4805755395683455
1419237,5,B00005ATQJ,"The Shining, based on Steven King's novel is a masterpiece! I usually don't watch horror movies but this one was not like many I had seen before. What I like about this movie was it was not unpleasent to watch, and I say that because I don't like movies with a lot of gore. This movie had some but since the movie was very interesting, I was still able to watch.
  The movie is about a family that is hired to watch a summertime hotel over the winter. Jack Nicholson plays as Jack Torrance[father]. Shelley Duvall plays as Wendy Torrance[mother] and Danny Lloyd plays as Danny Torrance[son]. Jack has really been in this hotel before and that's why when Jack first walked into the hotel he mentioned: ""it seems like I have been here before"". Danny was born with something called the shining which means that he can see things that may have happened a long time ago, or things that might not have happened yet. So, Danny and Jack begin to see very strange things around the hotel and eventually it drives Jack crazy and he wants to kill his family.
  I thought that the movie was very well done. Jack Nicholson's acting was very good and it seems that he is the one that really fits to the character. The special features is also interesting, featuring the making of The Shining. It shows how many scenes were done. The music is very haunting and the scenery is good.

1419238,5,B00005ATQJ,"Why this movie opened to negative reviews when it first came out is something I will never quite understand.  Sure - this film has almost nothing to do with the King novel.  Yes - at times it doesn't make sense.  And yes - it is a tad bit too long.  But all these complaints can be justified.
First of all - everyone knows that there was simply no way to bring the novel to the screen as King wanted it.  Kubrick knew what he was doing.  To bring the story to the screen as King wanted it would have required six hours perhaps, which was how long the T.V. miniseries was (know anyone who craves to buy that film on DVD?)  For the Shining to work as one film it had to be done the way Kubrick did it.  Thus Nicholson's performance is justified and at times brilliant.  His quick descent into madness is appropriate for (1) film.  A gradual descent would have taken much more then 142 minutes.
Plot - honestly - anyone who complains about the confusion of the plot are the kind of people that complain about taking a plane ride to Hawaii in second class.  WHO CARES?  Style over substance perhaps, but when your heart is pounding during the bathroom scene or the Heeeeeeeere's Johnny moment, do you honestly care if the plot doesnt make a whole lot of sense.  Yes the ghosts aren't given a motive for their making Nicholson kill his wife, nor does the final image make a whole lot of sense, but there is complaining, and then there is nitpicking.
Length - I agree it runs too long, but as I sit here, I honestly cannot think of a single scene that should have been cut.  The doctor scene perhaps, but even that scene is effective, as Wendy's account of Jack's drunkenness give an ominous feel to his mannerisms.
But enough about the cons.  There are so many pros that make this film nothing short of a classic.  The set design of the Overlook, the profoundly creepy and atmospheric score, Kubrick's solid direction, and then the performances, which make the film soar.  Scatman Croethers is naive, wily, and charming as the ill-fated cook who dares to mingle with Jack's ""duty"".  Duvall's aw-shucks mannerisms wear a bit thin, yes, but they prove a perfect counterpoint to the deranged lunacy of Jack.  Besides, when Jack flips out in the lounge scene, she fake cries as good as any actress as I have ever scene. Danny Lloyd has a hypnotic screen presence as a boy hiding some horrible secret - check out the glare in his eye as Wendy talks to him as he becomes Tony.
And then there is Jack.  What a complete actor this man is!  His performance is campy, over-the-top, out-of-control, and brilliant.  Let the King loyalists praise Steven Weber for turning Jack Torrance into an inconsequential ninny.  When Jack peers through crack in the door and utters his famous line, the horror is palpable.",1072224000,3,2793,4.508946322067595

The little boy moving his finger and saying ""Redrum"" in that growly voice is also embarassing. Shelly Duvall was so obnoxious and whiny you almost wanted something to happen to her; not sympathetic at all, neither was the little boy. There were fleeting moments of tension and great photography, period. Another, later version, was far better than this, and stuck to King's original story, which needed no guilding/amplifying/re-creating. Nicholson's smarminess, Duvall's crying and whining, and the little boy with his ""redrum"" were enough to send me screaming fomr the room...not from the horror but from the embarassingly bad peformances, screenplay and direction. Love Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece, but this one...well, I've already said it. Stephen King is a great writer; bring his stories to the screen as he wrote them! PLEASE!

1419243,4,B00005ATQJ,"Brilliantly made film by Mr Kubrick which gets the viewer in its grip from the opening shot of a little VW bug edging its way up a road on the side of a very large mountainous valley with a stupendous, Wagnerian like intimidating soundtrack of orchestral music.  These litttle people, in their little car, are soon occupying, as caretakers over winter, alone, a huge hotel.  One them, the husband,  goes mad, or perhaps, madder, the child,  starts seeing ghosts, and the third has a nervous breakdown.  A tour de force for Mr Nicholson who lets fly all his acting skills.  Along with Carrie perhaps the best film of  a Stephen King original.  If you willingly suspend disbelief the film can be remarkably unsettling.  One instance is when the wife discovers husband's manuscript he's been working on for some months - it contains just one sentence repeated thousands of times, which Kubrick insisted be typed up by hand for authenticity - the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog  HELPPPP!!!",1067299200,2,995,4.8

1419245,5,B00005ATQJ,"The first time you see The Shining, it scares the crap out of you. The second time, you know what's coming, which takes the edge off of it.
But the second time you see it, you get to take in each scene and see how Kubrick filmed it. You notice a lot of structural ideas --- the way things are set up for maximum effect. For example, when Jack meets the former caretaker in the bathroom, their entire bodies fill the screen and they stare at each other. You wonder if they are going to punch each other or just talk. The room is silent and cold and clean.
Every scene has that kind of special structure. It keeps you slightly off-balance for the entire film. On DVD, you can watch each scene over and over, pick them apart, and see the details under the surface.",1066435200,2,761,4.219178082191781
1419246,4,B00005ATQJ,"I really liked Stanley Kubrick's version of Stephen king's novel.  I think Jack Nicholson was perfect guy for the lead role.  Shelly Duvall, however, was one of the most annoying actresses ever cast in a horror movie.  Yikes!  Rebecca De Mornay put forth a much better performance in the T.V. remake.  Little Danny was great.  I guess the Kubrick and T.V. versions both had their strong points.
The old lady in the bathtub scene was, and is, one of the creepiest horror scenes ever filmed.  It made me cringe!  And that slow-pounding heartbeat resonating throughout the movie was more creepy than walking through a morgue in the dark. Jack Nicholson's uncanny ability to bring out the lunatic in his character, with those devilish facial expressions, is an absolute treat to the fans of horror.
Still very scary to this day, The Shining is one of my all-time favorite horror movies.  They really knew how to make them back in those days.",1065571200,,937,4.770186335403727

Of course if you've read the book and seen this movie, you'll see many differences and stuff left out, and changed. No bushes shaped like animals chase Danny, Jack has an axe instead of a mallet, Jack actually does kill the cook, and the Overlook does not blow up because of a neglected boiler.
On to the movie. Jack Nicholson rules in this flick. His facial expressions, line delivery, and dance with madness will forever be immortalized here. Shelly Duvall is the helpless wife who cannot cope with her husband, and finally Danny, the young son with psychic powers.
Of course the `ghost' characters round the film out in a great, fun filled way. The two daughters who Danny meets in the hall will give you the shivers, especially when you see them axed, their father the `former caretaker' has his own charm, the bartender, the bathtub chick, and the homosexuals in animal costumes all help Jack sink deeper and deeper into madness.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy indeed. Anyone who likes a little psycho drama with their horror will eat this film up.",1064707200,,1185,4.62085308056872

1419249,4,B00005ATQJ,"Stephen King's novel The Shining is a classic of modern horror and one of the author's best and scariest works.  The film  version of the tale may be more a product of Kubrick than King, but it is in its own way a good psychological thriller.
Whereas the novel encompasses far more of the supernatural nature of the Overlook Hotel's ghostly and evil residents, the film instead chooses to see Jack Nicholson's descent into madness as just that rather than largely the product of phantasmal touches.  Nicholson's performance is masterful in only the way he can deliver such a role; one might really wonder if he ought to be in a straight jacket at times.
Purists and fans of the novel might resent Kubrick's reinterpretation of King's novel--and the film is indeed the lesser of the two in comparison--yet still the Shining on video is a shocker to terrify and thrill and a requisite title in any fan's video library.",1064448000,,916,4.7125

That said, this is a terrific rewrite of the horrible Stephen King novel, which means it's actally scary. Kubrick knew how to make terrifying films, and this is no exception. Jack Nicholson is great in his role, and I do believe they got the timing right when he goes crazy. Yes it's early in the film, but he spent 4-5 months in that hotel before he snapps. Shelly Duvall is perfect for the scared mother, and the images are very disturbing. Especially the quick flash with the two twins. Also, there are plently of 'Long Shots,' as I call them, that Kubrick uses in every film he's done. The music is also creepy. My bands has been working on music somewhat like this.

1419251,5,B00005ATQJ,"It's tough to believe that Stanley Kubrick received a Worst Director Razzie nomination for ""The Shining."" While ""The Shining"" may not be given the classic status of some of his other films like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""2001"", it's actually the least polarizing of this highly-praised and atypical filmmaker's work.
This atmospheric thriller is sure to creep you out with its pacing, eery editing and cinematography (those tracking shots are highly effective), and Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as Jack Torrance.  Horror films often tend to divide audiences into genre fans who follow the gore and those who laugh in the face of so-called scares, insisting their own resiliancy to cheap thrills and lamebrain plotting.
Fortunately, ""The Shining"" doesn't make you take sides, because its chills come from plotting and character study as much as they do from odd sights that will make you jump. It may stray from Stephen King's book and not all of it may make sense, but ""The Shining"" has so much going for it that you won't mind. It's a gripping and satisfying film experience, and in my opinion, one of the best films of the '80s.
This Warner DVD re-release is definitely the version to get. The fullframe presentation comes at the wishes of Kubrick and the video and audio offer significant improvement over the drab initial release. (Unfortunately, the original Mono audio track has been dropped altogether in favor of an effective 5.1 remix. They could have included both with no problem.)
In the way of extras, there is an engaging half-hour on-set documentary, filmed by Kubrick's daughter Vivian. It provides a candid experience of the film's creation, and interviews with some of the actors. In addition, this DVD re-release includes an audio commentary on the documentary (sort of a ""making-of the making-of"") by Vivian Kubrick. There's also the spooky trailer, which shows how a movie preview can perfectly pique one's interest in a film, without spoiling (or even saying) much.",1061856000,150,1992,5.110429447852761

Where is the subtle psychological horror the book eminates so much? Where is the disintegration of a family man surrendering to lack of will and alcohol? Where is his failure in pulling things off no matter how much he wants to? Where is the symbolism the hotel represents?

In the book King really went to detail to describe that the caretaking job was the last resort to hold there trouble marrige together. It touch basis on how bad Jack had a drinking problem.

Another example is during an argument between Jack Nicholson (who performs incredibly well throughout the entire movie) and Shelley Duvall, after which Jack storms out of the room and glances at the camera as he goes by.

For me, that one horror film was this masterpiece, Stanley Kubrick's ""THE SHINING"".  I clearly remember, when I was 6 years old, it was the classic ""dark and stormy night"" (making the mood all the more scary) I saw a little more than half of this movie on TV.  My mom told me not to watch it, but my dad said I'd be fine.  At that time, NO, DAD, I WAS NOT FINE!!!!!!!!  I finally had enough common sense, even though I was little, to turn off the TV at one point; I'm pretty sure it was right after the ""rotting old lady in bathtub scene"".  This movie scarred me for literally three years after that!  I MEAN IT REALLY TRAUMATIZED ME!!! And my family knew it, too.  Whenever we'd go to the video store, my sister would grab a copy off the shelf and hold it to my face and scream loudly and I cried once or twice out of the 900 times she did it.  I always thought, ""Yeah, you can just shut up, Christina, because you didn't even see the movie!""  Just the sight of the cover freaked me out!  Oh...that face...that creepy, heart-stopping smile!  I was always afraid to be upstairs alone; I was afraid I'd see the two twin ghost girls at the end of my long hallway when I opened my bedroom door and I was afraid for a while to pull back the shower curtain on the bathtub for fear of the undead rotting woman getting out and attacking me.  NOW, THAT'S SIGNS OF A GREAT HORROR MOVIE!  The movie does what it wants to do, which is scare the hell out of you! Then, one night, I decided to face my fears because I thought my hair was going to start falling out from stress pretty soon!  I asked my dad to take me to the video store, I got there, I stared at the cover of the movie for like five minutes, I think I may have even punched it at the end of those five minutes, I moved the box aside and took the rental copy behind it.  I remember my dad saying ""yeah?  You sure you wanna go for it?""  I said, ""Yes,"" feeling proud inside. I rented it.  I watched it.  Now, surprisingly, this is one of my all-time favorite films and i own the DVD.

Some scenes were creepy, but overall, it just wasn't enough. Most of the film moved so unbearably slowly that my patience was lost at about the one-hour mark. Director Stanley Kubrick probably likes to do this: wear out the viewer's welcome by letting a film drag on forever. He did this with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and he does it again here. These two films are both visually stimulating, but they don't resonate with the viewer emotionally. Both story and character development are compromised by the dazzling but dull visual details that Kubrick brings to the table. Jack Nicholson and Scatman Crothers are both great actors in this film, but Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd are rather dull and lifeless. In the end, if you want a good psychological thriller, see ""Misery"" or ""One Hour Photo"" instead of ""The Shining"".",1056412800,5,987,4.777777777777778

This film really gets under my skin.  In many ways, it is completely overblown.  Nicholson's performance is way over the top, as is Duvall's, and the soundtrack becomes overwhelming by the end of the film.  Yet it all seems to work, raising the horror of the situation to operatic heights.  Director Stanley Kubrick knows how to frame and light a shot so that the desolation and chill of the environment seeps right off the screen.  Perhaps it is the basic horror of the situation that affects me so strongly.  The nuclear family should be the last bastion of trust and security, yet here we have a man stalking his family with an ax through the dim, deserted corridors of the cavernous hotel.  The final shot is intriguing and frustrating and made me wish that Kubrick had found a way to include more backstory about the Overlook.",1054252800,,1187,4.751219512195122
1419260,1,B00005ATQJ,"that Stanley Kubric decided to make a movie out of one of best horror stories around  and this was the pure lack of luck for King. I read the book 15 years ago and it is a cornerstone in my fondness to King. Having heard that it was a movie directed by Kubric (one of the directors I respect(ed before this movie) although I have not watched many of his works) I waited for years to find a very high quality version of it. For what? Just to see one of the worst book adaptations ever made. Jack is already crazy from the beginning...his wife, Wendy, is a hysterical silly thing that makes you want to grab the ax and cut her screaming tongue into two just to silence her...Danny, one of the most original characters in King's pallette, was turned into a shadow doing nothing but just cringing... a black cook who travels hundreds of miles just to get knifed as soon as he enters the hotel... sinister bush animals turning into silly labyrent...and worst of all, lots of unnecessary blood pouring from elevators (then why do you people hate Friday the 13th and Evil Dead because of lots of gush of blood) and two silly little girls supposed to be horrifying and foreshadowing. If you tell this summary to anyone and then make him read the book, he will say this has nothing to do with it...In itself alone the movie may be a nice and little horror movie with nothing exceptional...but as an adaptation, it is disgusting...just a reflection of Kubrick's unbearable arrogance trying to hint that he does anything and everything better.
To sum up: I am so much disappointed and disgusted with the movie that I woved never to see any other Kubric film in my life. If you have read the book, never attempt to see the movie;
If you have not watched the movie and read the book, then first see the movie and then read the book just to see what torment you have undergone.

As you see the main character's VW Bug driving to the hotel during the opening credits, there are several great helicopter shots. In one shot, you can see the shadow of the helicopter on the side of the mountain. It makes the film appear cheap and not well made. If they would fix this short shot, and edit that out, then the film would be wonderful. I understand this film is good, don't get me wrong, but little mistakes so obvious take away from the overall effect of the film, and make it look like no effort was put into production.",1050710400,2,641,4.262295081967213
1419262,1,B00005ATQJ,"Kubrick wants to be a genius. In some regards he may be, but in many regards it is his film making techniques that excel, but not his sense of story telling. There is a rule in literary fiction: if it does not progress the plot, throw it away. Kubrick excels in such excess. So many scenes in this movie have nothing to do with the plot.
It is understandable that Kubrick's tale is not the same as King's tale, and King himself is not the best writer in a literary sense, but he can write horror well.
If the plot of this movie is to illustrate Jack's insanity, then whole sections of the tale are unnecessary. We don't need background information on Mr. Darby (the Overlook's last killer/caretaker), the whole 1920's theme of the Gold Room is horribly unnecessary, and Danny's ""Shine"" (the basis of King's tale) is totally excessive.
If the point were to illustrate Jack's insanity, the story would focus on his inability to write. Kubrick ultimately wanted a different story then the one he started with. To add insult to injury, some scenes serve no purpose at all, but to confuse the audience. When Shelley DuVall runs into the room with the man in a bear costume doing ""something"" to a ghostly patron, well, what on earth does that have to do with anything? That scene makes me laugh every time I see it. Are we supposed to think that this hotel was some kind of Sodom and Gomorrah?(And a bizarre one at that)
The whole film hints at a long horrible history to the hotel, but Kubrick never evolves that. This is an interesting film and true to Kubrick's style, different. At the end of the day, it is not a good story. Kubrick tends to revel in visual stimulation versus plot stimulation (think 2001, A Clockwork Orange, etc). And sadly, more to the point, this movie is just not that scary.
See it once, to be sure, but even the 1997 made for TV remake does a much better job of telling a story.",1050710400,26,1901,4.4498567335243555

Lets begin with the 1997 version the woman in the bathroom scene was scary and no site for the human eyes. The animal hedges were very scary and very diffrent from the maze there were no little twins but i think the ghosts in this movie were a lot scarier then the older version. The dog head, grady the bar tender instead of playing a butler in the old version was a lot more forceful in this version.i liked the fact in the 1997 version tony was a actual spirit instead of a finger and the ending was veryyyy diffrent in this one in honesty i liked this ending better it made me shed a tear. The final thing i got to say is this one was 4 hours and 3 cds too long for me even though its a great movie and very detailed. Now on to jack nickolsans 1980 version. Where to begin but what a great actor this guy is he not only made me freak out but laugh at the same time. The maze was not as good as the animal hedges but it had its parts. The woman in the bathroom was more grotest then scary but still effective. When danny started screaming redrum i believed he was actually posessed by spirits. The best part of this movie is there were curses vulgar language and things the other movie couldn't have due to being made for television. The 1997 version is 4 hours this one is 2 and keeps all the important stuff. Nickolsan is the real jack the parts where it says all work and no play make jack a dull boy and wendy im not gonna hurt you im gonna bash your brains in and heres johny is what made the movie and the 1980 versions wins in my eyes",1048377600,,1618,4.043613707165109
1419265,4,B00005ATQJ,"Kubrick's The Shining is an inversion of King's story; King's novel is about a man driven to madness in a hotel every bit alive and as evil as the worst murderer. Kubrick's film, on the other hand, is about a man already standing at the abyss of madness who channels the energy of the hotel and fashions it to fit his madness.
All that really remains are the bare bones of King's story. It's understandable that King was displeased with Kubrick's film as it isn't his novel at all. Kubrick wasn't interested in the how's or why's of what happened but the process of madness and how it envelopes all those around it. In many respects, the obsession that pulls Jack Torrence into his ocean of madness, is not too dissimilar to the cinematic obsession that drove Kubrick himself. You could argue that this is as much about the destructive powers of the dry, conformist society we live in and the madness that seeps out of the artist forced to live in that society.
Or some pretentious claptrap like that.
The plot (thread bare as it is) concerns Jack Torrence and his family hotel siting the old, majestic Overlook Hotel. During winter the hotel isn't accessible because of its narrow winding roads and seclusion. Jack has recently given up teaching to work on his novel. He brings his wife and son along to this beautiful place. Unfortunately, the Overlook has a history of madness and murder. Jack's son, like his father, has the ability to ""shine"", i.e., read other people's thoughts, touch on the spiritual world.
Jack is a recovering alcoholic. When he's had a bit to drink he becomes dangerous and nasty. The Overlook's ""Ghosts"" provide Jack with drink. It's an imaginery drink representing his descent into insanity. Timmy, his son, is still innocent enough not to be seduced by the Overlook. The hotel wants him, though, because he has a stronger ability to ""shine"" than his father. The hotel literally moves in for the kill by pushing Jack into madness. He chases his family around the hotel in an attempt to kill them and make them join the Overlook as permanent residents.
There's more to the plot than there seems. Kubrick and co-screenwriter Diane Johnson change much of King's novel focusing on Jack's infectious insanity. Is the Overlook driving him to madness or is the energy there driving his madness--making it seem acceptable. We never really know. The bizarre ending (a departure from both King's novel and the television adaption)opens a Pandora's Box of questions that are never answered.
If you want fidelity to King's novel stick to the television adaption (which is also quite good). Both films provide fascinating bookends to a shared theme.",1047772800,,2665,4.833698030634573
1419266,4,B00005ATQJ,"Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) has writer's block. Needing, like all writers, some isolated time away from society to work on his assignment, he decides to become the winter overtaker of the Overlook Hotel, which sits on a lonely monutaintop in Colorado. During snowstorms, the lone road there is impassable, so Jack and his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) will be completely alone for a whole five months. But instead of finding the Muse at the hotel, Jack discovers other things that might not be so pleasant, or hopeful. His son is seeing strange, bloody visions of the previous family that had stayed here. What's behind room 237? And why is a once loving father carrying that axe?
Stanley Kubrick's film is reported to be very different from the novel by Stephen King, but since I haven't read the King book, I can't really compare. Whatever he did, however, the film is an effective and suspenseful piece of existential horror. The claustrophobic tracking shots down the hallways are very eerie the first time you see them, as are the visions that Danny (the son) sees, especially of the two little girls. However, if you're a horror film buff, you might find that this film isn't all that scary--it's often too slow-paced and deliberate (in Kubrickian fashion) to be too scary, and by modern standards the body count is very, very low. (The death scenes aren't as frightening as some of the title cards like ""TUESDAY"" to me!) The film ""shines"" mostly in Jack Nicholson's frenzied and passionate acting and in Kubrick's cinematography of the hotel; though many of the scenes and lines are familiar to movie buffs, it's still amazing to see his growing insanity on screen. Ultimately, this film is an exaggeration of the frustration of being a blocked writer.

1419271,2,B00005ATQJ,"Stephen King's excellent horror novel was essentially a character study of a family coming apart through the weakness of an alchoholic husband driven over the edge in a remote and spooky off-season hotel. The horror was as much psychological as supernatural, and any film adaptation needed subtle, careful writing and direction to effectively bring this out.
Stanley Kubrick was entirely wrong for this project, which badly exposed his limitations as a writer/director. Barry Lyndon had already shown that his very deliberate, technical style, while visually impressive, simply failed to tell human stories or create interesting, believable characters. Acting always looks so stilted in his later movies, probably due to the ridiculous amount of takes he insisted upon, stifling any spontenaity among his performers.
Stuck here with just a few characters, most of them hugely miscast, the whole exercise falls apart in terrible scripting, over-wrought performances sometimes bordering on the laughable and clumsy,ham-fisted plot development.
If this film did not carry Kubrick's name most reveiwers would recognise it for what it is - dull, uninvolving, badly made and lacking in any thematic point. Sorry Stanley, you couldn't hide behind enigmatic nothingness this time!
Two stars are for technical merit only.",1046131200,10,1312,5.597989949748744

1419274,4,B00005ATQJ,"At the height of the Overlook Hotels comes perhaps the height of Kubrik's work.  Of all of Kubrik's work, this so far stands as my personal favourite.
The film doesn't follow the story too closely to the book.  There are many scenes from the book that are missing (""Stephen King's The Shining"" is a closer adaptation).  But it still follows the basic story about a family who takes care of the Overlook Hotel and confronts ghosts.
Kubrik's adaptation offers much to think about.  The way the scenes are established still makes me wonder if all the hauntings are real, or are part of the character's imaginations.  The source of the film's horror stems from a psychological kind of aspect and to me alludes to a greater kind of dark force.  That is to say that the horror of the film is not in the ghosts, but in the characters' growing insanity and darkness.  The madness of the characters is real, and is very well portrayed (especially by Jack Nicholson).
For all its brilliant acting and provocative cinematography, this film captures the sheer horror of Stephen King's original novel and shoves it deep in the human mind.",1043452800,,1125,4.709183673469388
1419275,5,B00005ATQJ,"The Shining is a great supernatural horror film from the grand master of filmmaking, Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's films have a undescribably rich quality to them that makes them even harder to forget. This is especially present in The Shining, along with A Clockwork Orange, another favorite of mine, and a classic.
The Shining is a gothic horror film about a family Jack, Wendy, and Danny Torrance, who sign on as caretakers of the Overlook Hotel, a rural Colorado hotel that has horrible things lurking every door. Jack is an author experiencing a writer's block. A year earlier, Jack had gotten drunk and broken Danny's arm when he found him fiddling with a manuscript. He comes to the Overlook to get away from everyday distractions and work on his most recent novel. Young Danny has an extrasensory power known only as the shining. This information is told to Danny by the Dick Hallorann, the chef in the Overlook, who shares this eerie sixth sense. He tells Danny that if he is ever in trouble, to contact him using the shining. Danny's confused as to why he would say this, yet Danny has had some disturbing visions himself, and is watching his back. Dick knows about the Overlook's unstable history. Meanwhile, Jack is in a rut, and still can't write. The whole family is feeling claustrophobic, and strangers keep appearing to Jack and Danny. Jack has been recieving alcohol from Lloyd, the ghostly bartender in the dining room who really isn't there, and attending large black-tie parties and gatherings in that same dining room. At a party Jack meets Delbert Grady, a waiter trapped in the Overlook, who Jack has been told about. He tells Jack to kill them. To kill his whole family. Danny is experiencing bizarre visions of ghostly characters. Jack is spiralling into insanity, and he plans to take his family with him. He will further the pattern, put another piece in the puzzle.
The Shining is a disturbingly gothic fairy tale horror film that has yet to be matched by any other. One of Kubrick's best, and a modern classic, The Shining is a film that many will enjoy. I suggest going out and renting yourself a copy.

1419277,5,B00005ATQJ,"Kubrick's joyously pessimistic, counter-Nietzschean remake of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" finds a paradoxically rhapsodic filmmaking style to portray a nightmarish universe governed by malevolent supernatural forces (or is it that Time itself is a malevolent force, or the key to allow our own malevolent urges to work through eternity?).  Taking the glacial beauty of the ultra-aesthetic ""Barry Lyndon"" and revving it up with free-floating Steadicam action, endless tracking shots and zooms both somber and shocking, Kubrick makes ""The Shining"" a hyper-stylized art object.  What other space in cinema feels so inhabitable, so tangible to its viewers, as the Overlook Hotel?  We might well declare, with Nicholson's Jack Torrance, that we know what's going to be behind every corner.  And yet, all this pictorial seduction is tingling with menace-- and menace made concrete in all the worst forms; Kubrick incorporates themes of child abuse, spouse abuse, self-loathing, lust, madness, murder, even genocide in this cinematic catalog of sin and damnation.  Most disturbingly of all, Kubrick's notorious invocation of Eternal Recurrence reverses the starchild optimism of his ""2001"".  Indeed, by quoting a theme from Berlioz' ""Symphonie fantastique"" (itself quoted by Franz Liszt in his ""Danse Macabre"") Kubrick seems to reverse the Romantic quotations that open ""2001"" (Nietzsche's dawn to Strauss' to Kubrick's).  The Vermeeresque lighting provides an uncanny backdrop for the spectral goings-on; Kubrick and John Alcott's cinematography is flawless both in conception and in its technically breathtaking execution.  Why then has ""The Shining"", like ""Apocalypse Now"", been unable to shake a certain unsavory reputation among critics?  The explanation may lie, not with Nicholson's terrific performance (calibrated, in its exaggerations, to Kubrick's ultimate design) but in the film's uncanny irreducibility-- very few movies hide their most shattering ambiguities as well as ""The Shining"".  And yet it is one of the most compulsively viewable films in cinematic history.  Perhaps no other film comes as close to being a communally shared dream as ""The Shining"".  It is a gorgeous, intoxicating and obliterating nightmare from which a generation has yet to awake.",1041984000,,2261,5.6765578635014835
1419278,5,B00005ATQJ,"Of all the horror movies that I've seen (and I've seen hundreds of them), I'd rank this movie as one of the scariest ever made.

1419279,4,B00005ATQJ,"""The Shining"" is a haunting film, featuring the marvelous performance of Jack Nicholson. The movie is not really based on the book. It's just got some striking similarities, but mostly, it is a totally different thing entirely. Jack Nicholson is not just scary, but also, quite comical in his role as the madman recovering alcholoic author father who is taking care of the Overlook Hotel. He's endeavoring to fix up his act, write a book, and take care of the hotel while the owners are away during the winter. But, he develops writer's block, is isolated by the snow that surrounds the hotel. He soon sees the bar in the hotel is filled with ghosts that offer him booze. He drinks to his heart's delight. Finally, a drunken, hostile, isolated Jack goes insane, attempting to murder his wife. His child, Danny, can see haunting images of evil in the Overlook Hotel. Jack goes after his wife and son with an axe. It is a very strange yet interesting film, filled with horror, evil, terror, and some probably unintentional comedy. I recommend this film, but fans of the book may be disappointed. It is not nearly as detailed as the book. In the novel, Jack is a semi-normal guy going through some recovering alcoholic problems. In the movie, Jack is always kind of crazy. The hotel is a cramped, dizzy, ugly place, and, if I recall correctly, in the book the hotel was a big and beautiful place. Still, it is a great film, but only because of Jack Nicholson's performance.",1041292800,2,1470,4.657692307692308
1419280,5,B00005ATQJ,"The Shining makes one realize how utterly hard, almost impossible it is to make a scary movie. ...But the Shining, jesus this movie is so creepy. It just gets inside your head. It's scary to even think about this movie. I'm certainly not a film student or critic like some of the reviewers here but I'm in awe of Kubrick's accomplishment.
I thought as I watched it the last time about how Kubrick engineers this mounting sense of unease and dread in the viewer.
I believe that he makes the movie look very unnatural in quite subtle ways. Most scenes are brightly lit, and I noticed that there are not many shadows in the movie. Even in brilliantly lit scenes, you'll notice that things don't cast shadows. The colors are frequently bright pastels but don't have a patina, in other words don't reflect light, don't look at all shiny. I also noticed that so many of the scenes are set up symmetrically. From the scenes in the hallways, to the bathroom meeting between the butler and Jack, to the bedroom of Scatman Crothers, there is frequently a very symmetrical appearance of the room that I find, for some reason, highly unsettling. I think the shot of Crothers watching TV in his Miami bedroom, where the viewer watches from Crothers' viewpoint, and all you can see is his lower legs and feet, the lower half of the bed, and then this highly symmetrical, almost stylized tableaux with the TV, the odd nude painting and wall ornaments, this scene I found very disturbing. I don't know why, it is almost like a Rorschach inkblot releasing some subconscious fear or anxiety. There is also a scene in which the viewer is looking at Jack in bed, then the camera pulls back and you see you were actually seeing his reflection in a mirror, then the camera goes BACK into the mirror for the rest of the scene. It again feels very unnatural and unsettling, as if you can't trust your own eyes. Another unnatural feature is Shelley Duvall. Her performance in this movie has been denigrated but I think it is remarkable. But, she is an unusual looking woman. Coal-black hair, buck teeth, bug eyes, she is just, again, unnatural looking. Definitely not the usual femme fatale or spunky mom. There is never a moment in this movie where she gets a steely look in her eye, or sets her jaw, or makes some cold-blooded comment that lets us know she intends to fight and live. She seems weak,confused and beaten the whole movie. But Duvall can really act weak and confused and horrified. Just check out her face as she begins to read Jack's manuscript (""all work and no play..."") as her expressions veer from interest, to confusion, and finally to horror as she realizes that her husband has truly gone mad. And I love, I mean truly love, the scene where the butler spills something on Jack and then shepherds him into the bathroom to clean him up. Notice this, that you do not see the butler's face for the first two thirds of the scene, except a brief and incomplete glimpse as the spill occurs. Again, to be watching an extended scene in a brightly lit (and highly symmetrical) bathroom with only two actors in the scene and yet not really be able to see one of the actors' face is unnatural and somehow unsettling.
And here's this, the scene in the hotel room with the bathing woman. What in the scene lets us know that, as Jack is kissing her, that something is horribly wrong? You can barely see any of her face, just part of her hair and her profile, but she isn't moving at all. She looks dead, although if you stopped the film and examined the frames individually there is nothing to suggest she isn't the beautiful woman  who exited the tub. This is a horrifying scene, again highly symmetrical except for the shower curtain only halfway open. Again, weird,flat pastel colors.
The first time I saw this movie, in a theater, when Jack was kissing her, a woman in my row screamed at the top of her lungs in sheer unfiltered terrror, and then,crying, immediately left the theater. This is powerful psychological stuff. An absolute masterpiece of slowly mounting unease and fright.
The only other movie that comes even close to this level of subtle terror, of mounting amorphous dread, is Rosemary's Baby.
But no horror movie has the ability to get inside my head and truly unnerve me the way The Shining can. An amazing and absolutely essential movie.",1041120000,2,4342,4.60258064516129
1419281,4,B00005ATQJ,"I don't have enough space to fully discuss my thoughts on the book versus the movie (in a nutshell: i think the movie has some great moments, some stark performances, and a nice, even chill about it... but the book is a deeper, richer work that addresses family, failure and alcoholism [which is the real demon out to get the Torrance family]).
Whatever your feelings about the movie are, there's an extra feature on the DVD that makes the disk a worthwhile purchase: a short film, shot by Kubrick's daughter, called ""The Making of 'The Shining.'""
It's a fascinating reflection on acting, on moviemaking, on personalities, and it really blew me away.  You get insight into Nicholson, his rehearsal process and his performance, the tension involving Shelley Duvall, and a strange interview with Scatman Crothers who is really, really (really) happy to be involved with the production.
But mostly, you get to see and hear Stanley Kubrick in action. He is, of course, the man.  I'd never heard Kubrick's voice before I saw this documentary and you get to see him really winding some people up -- not just the lead actors but extras as well. Plus, there's a great scene in which Kubrick and Nicholson are explaining revised script pages to Kubrick's mom and I can't say for sure but I think she's bored by it all.  It's classic.
A creepy teaser trailer is also included on the disk but not the television preview, which -- when I was 10 years old -- completely scared the bejeezus outta me.  Maybe one day that'll surface.",1038614400,3,1518,4.716981132075472
1419282,5,B00005ATQJ,"The Shining is one of those horror films that can consider itself a masterpiece of screen horror.  Many people have complained on how long the film takes to build, but I fing the wait worthwhile for the terror later to come.  The direction by Stanley Kubric is excellent with his dream like tracking shots of the Overlook hotel.  Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd all give excellent performances as the winter caretakers of the Overlook hotel.  The film is nearly perfect.  Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the DVD.
Movie: The Torrence family is selected as the winter caretakers of the Overlook hotel.  Danny (Lloyd) has a special gift called ""Shining,"" hence the film's title.  This means he can see things before they happen.  Danny is able to somewhat able to see that his father, Jack,(Nicholson) will eventually go mad, and try to kill him and Jacks' wife, Wendy. (Duvall)  From here the suspense builds and builds until the finale.  An epic horror film in the truest sense of the word.  (5/5)
DVD:
Picture: Nearly horrible.  Grain, fuzziness, and dirt can always be spotted.  Film also shows wear.  It's obvious that there was no remaster for this studio release.  I watched the film on the cable channel FX recently, and the picture quality there looked like a masterpiece compared to what is presented here.  Warner Bros. should have taken at least some care in releasing this film on DVD.  The film is presented full frame.  I prefer widescreen, but if that's the way Kudrick wanted us to see it, then that's fine with me.  (2/5)
Sound:  Not as bad as the picture.  The only option here is the original mono soundtrack.  Dialoge sounds natural, but occassionally thin.  Music has a commanding precsense.  Not a bad audio presentation, but nothing to get excited about.  A 5.1 soundtrack would have been greatly appreciated.  (3/5)
Extras: There is a very funny and interesting documentary on the making of the film.  This was shot while the film was being shot.  The trailer is also included.  (4/5)
Overall:  A truly excellent film, but a mediocre DVD.  A special edition will hopefully be in the works.

1419283,5,B00005ATQJ,"First off, If you've read the book YES the movie left a lot out, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  This movie is already 2 and a half hours and if they would've made it just like the book you'd be watching a 5 hour movie.
Jack Nicholson is at his best here.  He is the main reason why this movie is so great.  He is psychotic right from the beginning of the movie.  The way his eyebrows curl up and he gets that sinister grin on his face.  The hotel is simply what drives him over the edge.  There are some especially frightening scenes in this movie including the bathtub scene, the scene in the ballroom's bathroom, and the scene where Wendy reads Jack's writing/story.  The only part I don't get is why Jack turns on his own son?  It's obvious why he wants to murder his wife, but he does seem to truly care for his son.  Anyway buy this movie right now if you want a really scary horror film.  Gore is at a minimum as is the body count.  It's not a slasher flick.  It's scary on a much higher level.",1035849600,,1010,4.096938775510204
1419284,2,B00005ATQJ,"Stanley Kubrick's adaptation from Stephen King's superbly written book has missed the point badly. Terrible casting and bad direction has turned this subtle psychological suspense/horror book into a straightforward horror movie. Jack Nicholson, who is otherwise a genuinely talented actor cannot be held totally responsible, in my opinion, for the horrible overacting here. His character just transforms into a monster instantly, no progression, no suspense, one minute a sane, loving father, the next a raving maniac. Shelley Duvall is a disaster as his wife Wendy, her neverending hysterics a constant irritation throughout the film. I was almost hoping for her to get the axe just so that I'd be free from the agony of having to watch her cry. Stanley Kubrick's patented overuse of steadicam and wide angle lens keeps us so much away from the story and the horror that we're never engrossed totally. Also too elaborate lighting on the sets is distracting instead of being realistic, reinforcing that effect of isolating us from the action. Editing is slow paced with needlessly long shots, causing the scenes to look conceived and forced. I was really disappointed with Stanley Kubrick's clinical style here, which in my opinion is more suited to a technical film like 2001.",1035849600,10,1277,5.203883495145631

1419287,4,B00005ATQJ,The Shining is definitly one of the scariest movies i've seen.  It stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence who applies to take care of the overlook hotel during the winter months.  He starts out pretty normal maybe a bit strange when he's talking to mr. ullman during his interview.  THe movie starts out a bit dull but once the movie starts and the family is buy themsleves in the hotel it's scary. Jack's son Danny has an ability to shine so he knows what's going to happen just like Dick Halloran {Scatman Crothers} head chef at the hotel.  The movie goes through it's eerie scences like when Jack is talking to the ghostly bartender Lloyd and when he's talking to Dilbert Grady in the bathroom and of course when Danny is writing Redrum in his room also when the elevator opens and a pool of blood covers the screen. The overlook hotel itself has great scenery and also how they show the hotel practically every time the day switches on the mountain setting.  Jack is great in this role and people will always remember him in this movie.  I would recomend this to anyone who likes horror and if your a horror fan and you  didn't see this were have you been. this is the second time this DVD has been out at first there's was no remaster and the sound was awful. the second time time they remastered the sound and picture and it's great.  Documentary is funny. Full screen doesn't bother me because that's how Kubrick the director wanted it shown in the 1:33 format.,1033862400,,1467,4.468164794007491
1419288,5,B00005ATQJ,"By far, one of the best horror films ever made, Stanley Kubrick brings to life the haunting bestseller by Stephen King. Jack Nicholson is at his best, as the recovering alcoholic and winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. His wife, Wendy, and son Danny reside in the isolated hotel with him as he attempts to finish his novel. Given, the movie leaves out many key concepts of the book, Jack's violent history being the most significant, but Kubrick has a way of filming like no one else. His films are based on visuals, not on dialogue. The often overused saying, ""A picture is worth a thousand words,""  is truly the essence of this movie.
 Kubrick's style of moviemaking was perfect for this film, and no director could have managed to do it better. Many of the most notorious movie scenes in history were created for this film, especially the ""blood in the elevator"" scene. True, this film is frightening and disturbing, but also an amazing work of art by one of the greatest directors of all time.",1033776000,,1001,4.649717514124294
1419289,5,B00005ATQJ,"Amazing to think that Stephen King did not like this adaptation. Apparently he believed that Kubrick did not appreciate or emphasize the evilness inherent in the Overlook Hotel, which he believed should have been the star of the show. But King has always been preoccupied with trying (often vainly) to make inanimate objects seem evil and scary, from cars to trucks to killer topiary. More often than not, it's juvenile stuff. After all, a car is just a car, but people are scary as hell.
Kubrick, on the other hand, was wise to focus on the characters who inhabit and haunt the Overlook Hotel, both past and present. Their evilness in thoughts and deeds is manifested brilliantly in Nicholson's performance. He manages to be manical without going over the top, without wrecking the suspension of disbelief. He's a guy hanging onto sanity by his fingernails and the guests at the Overlook have given him that last final nudge.
The characters themselves, like many from the pen of King, are flat and cartoonish and yet Kubrick doesn't fight it. From Nicholson's descent into madness, Duvall's whimpering terror, and little Danny's creepiness, the characters are all they need to be, multiplied by ten.
The strange Arbus-like visuals, the coldness and isolation of the hotel, and the mystery that pervades the movie are all brilliantly done. There is no ""cut and dried"" plot resolution, something that is both unsettling and refreshing in the dumb-downed world of Hollywood movies. The movie gets under your skin and stays there, like a bad nightmare. And it does so without brutalizing the audience like so many modern horror movies (e.g. ""Hannibal,"" etc.).
Kubrick diffuses and lightens King's manipulative scenarios and the movie is more powerful for it. Unfortunately, subtlety and understatement are in short supply these days in all forms of media. Writers and directors think if they are not in your face, screaming in Dolby stereo that no one is listening. A shame.
""The Shining"" is easily one of the best horror movies ever made. Given King's disappointment with it, the credit has to go mostly to Kubrick.

1419292,5,B00005ATQJ,"Starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers.
This is one of the best horror movies ever and one of Kubrick's best movies. I first saw this movie with two of my friends on TBS(I now own the restored version DVD) when I was 6 years old. It was the scariest movie I had ever seen. Jack Nicholson scared me to death in the ""Here's Johnny!"" scene. If I were you, I would skip the scene when Jack goes into Room 237.
 It starts with a writer named Jack Torrance(Nicholson) who gets a job to caretake for an isolated hotel in the Colorado Rockies. He brings his wife Wendy(Duvall) and his psychic son Danny(Lloyd). Jack hears from the manager Stuart Ullman(Barry Nelson) about the previous cartaker who killed his wife and two daughters with an axe. At the hotel, the Overlook Hotel's cook Dick Hallorann(Scatman Crothers), who is also psychic, talks to Danny about the ""shining"". Hallorann also warns Danny about the hotel and Room 237. ONE MONTH LATER, Danny sees strange things. Blood pouring out of an elevator. Two little girls stalking him. The word ""REDRUM"" on a door. At that time Jack is finding weird things of his own. He gets drinks from a ghost bartender. He runs into Delbert Grady(Philip Stone), the previous cartaker!! Grady tells Jack that Danny is using his ""shining"" against him and Jack turns against his family. Danny tries to shine to Hallorann to get help sense Jack hasn't been acting himself lately. Can Hallorann make it in time?

""The Shining"" is easily one of the best Horror movies ever made. has a great supporting cast: Scatman Crothers, Barry Nelson, and Philip Stone. I think that Scatman Crothers won a Best Supporting Actor Award. Look on us.imdb.com to find more information. Unlike Friday the 13th, which was also made in 1980, this movie had a very low body count. I thought that this was one of three of the most sucessful Horror films of all time(the others were Psycho and Halloween).
I do sort of understand why Stephen King didn't like this version. There were many differences between the movie and the book. In the book, they didn't skip one month later. The killer used a Rougue Mallet instead of an axe. I recommend the restored version of The Shining instead of the original DVD. This movie tops other scary movies like A Nightmare on Elm Street(pretty good), Friday the 13th, and Scream(another good slasher) Overall, this movie gets an A+!",1032566400,,2413,4.742857142857143
1419293,3,B00005ATQJ,"I don't think anyone looked more-forward to this movie than I did when it came out in the summer of 1980.  ""The first epic horror film"" was its tagline.  I'd read the novel and ate up the hype and saw it opening day...and then left the theatre a little confused: it didn't scare me.  At all.
The critic for Newsweek said that THE SHINING made THE EXORCIST look like ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET BEELZEBUB.  Really?
I will say that THE SHINING is probably the most beautifully photographed horror film ever made.  The scene where Jack Torrance sells his soul for a glass of beer to the patient, creepy Lloyd the bartender hints at the evil behind the Overlook Hotel.  Satan closing that simple deal in the cavernous ballroom is one of the film's highlights for me.
But the movie never gets any momentum.
I've read as many Stanley Kubrick biographies as I can find (some good, some really bad) and I believe the reason THE SHINING doesn't work is fairly simple: Kubrick never believed in an afterlife.  He believed in evil in the world, evil in human beings, but the idea of Satan, ghosts, the supernatural eluded him.
Stephen King said in an interview back in 1980 that Kubrick would call him at all hours to pepper him with questions during production.  Questions like, ""Do you believe in God?""
(In the Argosy article back then, King said that he told Kubrick that he didn't.  Since his horrible accident, King now tells the same story--except that he now says he told Kubrick he did).
And, in my opinion, when you keep this in mind while watching the film, you understand that Kubrick's normally razor-sharp perceptions as a filmmaker appear a little vague and out of focus.  The emphasis shifts from a malevolent haunted house to one guy losing his sanity.
The DVD is worth it for Kubrick's daughter's documentary, ""The Making of THE SHINING.""  As a lifelong Kubrick fan (DR. STRANGELOVE is, in modern terms, still Da Bomb), I'd never heard the reclusive director's voice until this DVD came out a few years ago.
What I really missed though was the second trailer from 1980, the one they played on TV just before the film was released.  The DVD includes the first trailer--the single shot of the elevator opening to release a tidal wave of blood in the hotel--but does anyone remember the TV commercial?  Wendy Carlos' throbbing main title plays as different shots from the film roll.  No dialogue.  And one of the last shots is Jack with his face pushed through the shattered door--but not the shot from the film!  It's some alternate take (and there were a slew of them).  He's laughing hysterically, his face locked in satanic glee, all teeth and eyebrows...and his eyes are dead with evil.  Somebody, please dig that out!  Over 20 years later and I still remember that!",1032393600,,2769,4.6721649484536085
1419294,5,B00005ATQJ,"Let's put this as simply as possible : The Shining, is without a doubt, a film I'm quite literally obsessed with. In all of my twenty three years, nothing I've seen since has affected me quite so deeply as Stanley Kubrick's masterful retelling of Stephen King's little tale about a family, a hotel and a force of pure evil. Forget the book, the film snakes it's way inside your brain and locks you in with The Torrances for it's murderously tense two and a half hour running time. Considered by some (including me) to be the scariest film ever made, noting it's qualities would take up this entire web site. I won't bore you with scrawling out here the plot and themes explored in the movie, I simply urge that if at present, you are yet to view The Shining, waste not another night. Draw the curtains, load up the DVD, pull a chair into the centre of the room and go on a guided tour into the Overlook Hotel.

Jack Nicholson plays as a writer who stays in a haunted hotel with his wife and his son who has mind powers. Jack goes crazy later on and tries to kill his family. You'll see some scary situations, like the bathtub scene. I won't spoil it but you'll see. There's also a remake miniseries that showed on Scifi but you shouldn't try to remake an awesome movie and the remake miniseries weren't that good anyway.

1419296,5,B00005ATQJ,"Ok I watched this movie like half a month ago or so for the first time.  I watched it at like at midnight with one of my friend's and I was scared even though much doesn't scare me in the line of movies.  I haven't seen the exorcist before, I hear that's very scary, but to me this is the scariest that I have seen.  It's maybe slow for like a half hour maybe 40 minutes, but that is when it's preparing the story and then it gets really scary.  Although not much killing and there is hardly any blood, they are pretty much quick glimpses of mutilated corpses, but the quick glimpses are gory.  But anyhow this is a movie that doesn't require showing you a body getting ripped inside out for a minute to scare you.  The roles are perfect and this movie had me the entire time.  If you thought Halloween or something like that was scary or no movies can scare you, grab this, and if you've got a lot of guts then watch it alone at night, although I watched it at night with a friend.  Although it is probably more fun with a friend.  Try this.  Unless you don't like getting scared then this is for you.  It will probably be disturbing for you though for the rest of the night definately atleast.",1031616000,,1195,4.17467248908297

In Kubrick's tale things start to get spooky at a remote Colorado hotel, and as the characters discover they are trapped, so we discover we are trapped with them, shut up in an amazing labyrinth with an axe-wielding madman we have suddenly found out we cannot trust.
Music (mainly by the Hungarian composer Bela Bartok) and camerawork are the chief contributors to the atmosphere of a film which is one of the few genuinely frightening I have experienced.",1029888000,,583,4.561904761904762

Wendy is a weaker woman in the movie, Dick gets killed instead of coming to the rescue and Danny talks to himself instead of hearing Tony in his mind.  Also, in the movie Jack is crazy from the start and the hotel just makes it worse.
So, has Kubrick butchered the book? No. Kubrick's Shinning stands on it's own as one of the scariest, most unnerving horror movies ever made. If you can watch the woman in the bathtub scene and not squim in your seat, check your pulse because you might be dead.

Well looks like Kubrick. Developed a lonellines, depressive environment where the Hotel plays another character in this movie, where the poor old jack  slowly  makes a transition to the madness.
And we have a more dramatic ending than the book with Jack running with an axe across the hotel  trying to cut Danny in thousand pieces, that's entertainment.
Also we have Shelley, which was more scary and effective than the hotel's ghosts, and even Jack himself.

It is a must see for anyone who is a fan of either Kubrick or Nicholson (his finest performance other than in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""). My only displeasure at watching the film on DVD is the fullscreen format. Why can't this film be distributed in its original theatrical aspect ratio? I feel that we are missing a lot. I saw the film in a theater in 1980 and I think we are missing out on Kubrick's intent in framing each scene so eloquently.

alcoholism. 2no job. 3a young kid that has some metal problems4a wife that has no control of her family or recives no love 5a husband that has no creativeity with his work. 6a son that is afaid of his dad .just alot of issues with this family.so bringing this family into the middle of nowwhere and seeing how they might get threw an entire winter of solitude.might bring the worst out of any one.nothing to do but (watch t.v ).(eat all that food). (ride around the hotel on a big wheel) .or get lost in the maze.  so when jack finnlly reaches the point that he loves this place better than his family because she wants to leave he snaps...heres johnny......one important scean that jack says when he talks to shelly on the bed about .she had her whole life to figure things out.(just like the scean in eyes wide shut)
  you might get the vibe that he is really talking about himself,that he feels kind of worthless and needs something to belong to..(maybe the hotel is his escape) so of course this movie is really not about everything i have just said but it is really another way of looking at it.being a more politicaly incorrect way .which is some thing that stanley was known for.  so at the ending of the film when the camera goes to a picture of jack with the date july 4th.that to me only thinks that this was jacks independance day.he has always been there because he has wanted to be something not the bad father he was or the alcoholic.but a creative writer a man that could be the center of attention.....so you decide horror or a journey into the relems of the disfuntional family.......seeing how kubricks other movies EYES WIDE SHUT , LOLIDA, A CLOCK WORK ORANGE AND BARRY LYNDON .had those themes there must be a link????",1024704000,3,2423,4.472850678733032

1419306,1,B00005ATQJ,"Stephen King's best book becomes Stanley Kubrick's worst movie. As usual, Kubrick's cinematography is incomparable, but it's almost the only worthwhile thing in this epic mess.
The characters are completely unsympathetic. Alcoholic madman Jack Torrance, hired to be winter caretaker of Colorado's (fictional) Overlook Hotel, is plainly crazy from the first moment he appears on camera, so going to the point where he attacks his hapless family with an axe is such a short step that there's nothing surprising about it. His wife, Wendy, is annoyingly simpering, making it hard to care that her life is in danger. His son, Danny, is virtually catatonic throughout the film, and only shows any signs of life toward the end, when menaced by his crazy father - the rest of the time, he comically talks to his finger in a really idiotic voice, which makes no sense at all. The only sympathetic character in the lot is that of the Overlook's cook, Halloran, who exists as nothing more than a plot device to deliver Jack's captive family, and then die a violent death (which is itself rather unconvincing).
The film itself is disjointedly chaotic, and deathly slow and overlong. Scene separators are employed that are inconsistent - at one point, a card on the screen tells the audience it is ""December,"" at another point one reads ""10:37 P.M.,"" and a later third one reads ""Thursday."" Since none of these things are in the slightest important to the plot, they are nonsensical to begin with, and all the worse for their lack of any unity. Similarly, act headers such as ""The Interview"" appear for no worthwhile reason, and throw the viewer out of any semblance of continuity of action. And the question of whether the Overlook Hotel is actually haunted by real ghosts or only by one mad alcoholic with an axe is so inconsistently addressed that to even attempt commenting on it would itself sound confused and inane.
But worst of all, the film simply isn't scary. It has more unintentional laughs than anything else. And that's when it isn't boring the viewer to sleep. The use of scary-sounding atonal music is almost an overkill telegraph to the audience, screaming, ""This is a scary movie!"" because, if it wasn't there, no one would know the movie wasn't supposed to be a cartoon black-comedy. And it doesn't work, both because it is overused and because it builds, repeatedly, to...nothing at all.
This is just an incomprehensible film, no matter how you look at it. Read King's terrific book. And if it's Kubrick you want, watch any of his other films, almost all of which are terrific.",1022284800,42,2584,4.84841628959276

Jack NIcholson is arguably our generation's greatest actor and here he gives a tremendous, energetic, and unforgettable performance. Nicholson as Jack Torrance is funny, crazy, and scary all at once! SOme of his scenes are so funny and scary you don't know whether to laugh out loud or scream! Nicholson would be enough to make this film great but what makes it a classic is all the supporting roles. Shelly Duvall is fantastic as Wendy, Jack's skinny meek wife who is confronted with a deranged husband and disturbed son in an abandoned snowbound hotel. Danny Lloyd(whatever happened to him?) is also solid as their 7 year old son Danny. Amazing performance by this talented little boy just adds believability and fear to the movie. Then we have the direction of Stanley Kubrick and the Overlook Hotel itself. The atmosphere and the music are absolutely terrifying. The music just chills your bones! THis movie is just perfect, absolutely perfect, I can't find a single fault with it, a true American horror masterpiece. The only controversy about this film has come from the author Stephen King who claims that Kubrick didn't do a faithful interpretation of his novel. THis is true to an extent. I've read King's book and it is good. But this is one case where the movie is BETTER than the book. Kubrick's ""The Shining"" is a stunning ghost story with gore and violence thrown in. While King's novel is a psychological family drama. I think King should just be happy that Kubrick used his book to make this movie.

Jack Nicholson y Shelley Duvall give great performances (it's beyond reality), as well as the little kid going: REDRUM and writing it with red lipstick in the bathroom door. Cabin fever meets a baroque use of images to suggest spirits and evil forces playing through the entire movie.

1419326,4,B00005ATQJ,"In an introduction to a new edition of Stephen King's book, The Shining, he says that he reached a point while writing the book where he could leave the main character as just an every day crazy villian, or he could go deeper, and create someone who was not only driven insane by the ghosts of the hotel, but by his past (pariticularly his father, and memories of certain things he did while he was drunk-read the book for specifics).  Not only would he be DRIVEN to kill, he would start to WANT to kill.  Mr. King did decide to go deeper, and the result is one of the best books around.  Unfortunately, Mr. Kubrick decided not to go deeper.  In the movie, Jack Nicholson plays a guy who is insane from the get-go.  Nothing really interesting about his character really, but it provides for some cool movie lines.
I'm not saying that this is a horrible movie, though.  As evidenced by my four star rating, I think this is a pretty good movie.  It definately is scary, using kind of subliminal images (flashing the dead twin little girl ghosts on the screen) much like The Exorcist, to provide an air of real spookiness that will have you looking over your shoulder if you watch this alone at night, to make sure there isn't a ghost behind you or something.
However, Kubrick could have elevated this to the rank of a classic.  In the book, the main character slowly is driven mad by the hotel.  He doesn't just go nuts, though.  He fights (not literally-in his head) the influence of the hotel.  He actually has times where he comes out of the trance it has him in, usually after he does something he normally wouldn't do, like hitting his son-and he thinks to himself ""What the hell did I just do?"".  He also kind of redeems himself in the end.  The book also has some great sequences that would have been great in the movie.  Like the whole thing with the hedge animals.  I read that part and was totally freaked out.  I jumped when I heard my heater kick on!  It also included the boiler which needed to have the steam knocked down everyday, or else it would explode.  There are just so many elements of the book that could have made this movie into a masterpiece!  What was Stanley thinking?!
Anyway, enough of my b#tching.  This was a very entertaining movie, and it held my interest throughout.  It definately can be watched over and over again without becoming boring.  A great effort by Kubrick, but he could have made it a sensational effort (there I go again...I just can't seem to stop my p*ssing and moaning about this).  I highly reccommend that you see it, and on second thought, I think the title of my review is a little harsh, but it is a cool title and I like it too much to change it.  If you feel that I just bashed one of your favorite movies, feel free to click ""NO"", but really, this is a good movie and I DID like it.",1011916800,8,2840,4.355513307984791

1419329,2,B00005ATQJ,"Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', judging by its cult reputation over the years, and its high rating on this website, has become a classic. It has gained a notorious reputation among film lovers. It was horror movie made by Stanley Kubrick, a director who arguably has had greater polarization than any other filmmaker in history. It has a legendary performance by the legendary Jack Nicholson. It has several scenes that have scared the crap out of people, most notably the 'river of blood' sequence. Does 'The Shining' deserve the reputation that it gets, or is it yet another confusing Kubrick film that is overrated?

The story is loosely based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. It is about a family of three who have to take care of an expensive hotel for the winter. Jack Torrence (Nicholson) is a struggling writer who is the main caretaker. His wife and his son accompany him for the winter stay. What happens during their stay is a series of terrifying events that leads to a tragic conclusion. What is most interesting about 'The Shining' is that it horror film that not like most other horror films. It follows a formula of creating tension, rather that blood and gore. Although there is violence in the film, it is not as explicit or gory as other horror movies. This is a good thing and it is not surprising that Kubrick followed this formula.

Kubrick, once again, shows his masterful craftsmanship for film-making. The lighting, editing, and overall technique is unparalleled. It can be argued that no other filmmaker could shoot a film as well as Kubrick did. But at the same time, this mastery is his greatest flaw. What he mastered in the technical side, he gave up in storytelling, character, and logic. 'The Shining' is often goofy and silly, rather than tense and frightening. It is very slow and many scenes and unnecessarily long. Two superstars exist in the film. One is Stanley Kubrick.

The other is Jack Nicholson. Nicholson gives one of his most memorable performance as a writer who goes mad at his stay in the hotel. His acting is really over-the-top, but Nicholson is such a supreme actor, we do not care because it is Jack Nicholson. Actors do not get any larger than him. Near the end of the film, when he confronts his wife by his typewriter, is absolutely awesome film-making. Nicholson is at his most brilliant. The other people in the film are simply annoying. Shelly Duvall is so annoying playing his wife, it is no wonder Jack wants to ""bash her brains in"". Danny, Jack's son, is equally annoying. I believe child actors should play a very minimal role in adult films. Minimal meaning they should only say a few lines and take up no more than 10 minutes. I understand Danny is at the center of the film, but do most people really think children have the maturity and ability to be in films like these?

Another thing that is annoying about 'The Shining' is its change of subject matter. A film that begins exploring themes of alcoholism and child abuse, slowly turns into yet another silly horror movie. Yet another typical horror movie with the madman with the ax and the screaming woman. One major thing does not make any sense. When Wendy discovers what Jack has been writing for months on end, it has a logical flaw. It suggests Jack has been crazy since the first day he stepped into the hotel, and that he did not go insane over time. Why on Earth would he be crazy from the beginning and why did his family not notice? Should we be asking these deep questions because it is yet another horror movie, or should be ask them because it is a Kubrick film? This is the frustration many people feel after they have finished watching a Kubrick film. It isn't that they don't ""get it"", they just don't get what all the fuss was about.",1009497600,4,3781,4.613670133729569

1419334,5,B00005ATQJ,"This should serve as a pre-warning to Stephen King fans: stay away!!!  Yes, indeed, Stanley Kubrick did take liberties with King's 1977 novel.  But is this a crime?  Kubrick's entire approach to filmmaking is based on taking a well-know piece of literature and twisting it to meet his own artistic vision.  And what a vision it is!  While there is a genuine sense of dread permeating throughout the film, it actually plays more successfully as a sly satire of the horror genre than as the real deal.  Jack Nicholson's performance, for example, is a comedic one; there is no way one could get through the classic bar scene without cracking a smile.  Nicholson winks at the audience from the very beginning; his dialogue during early scenes is tinted with a benign sarcasm.  Once he begins to lose it, he loses it ten-fold!  Jack has never been as charismatically psycho as he is here.
As with most of Kubrick's films, every character (from Shelley Duvall's spacey housewife to the hilariously WASP-y hotel manager) comes off as a one-dimensional parody of their real-life counterpart.  Why?  Because Kubrick's primary objective is to satirize human behavior, to reveal all of the absurdities and contradictions so commonplace in ""civilized"" society (check out ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"").  And it all takes place within one of the finest set designs ever used in a Hollywood film.  Kurick's approach to horror is take-it-or-leave-it, but there's no denying this is a milestone picture and a work of art.  If there ever was a testament to the enormous talents of both Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson, this it is.",1004140800,,1650,4.974452554744525

I have seen the remake though & here is what I have to say.  Kubrick's version is simpler, uses less horror effects (maybe technology constrainsts too or maybe his own option), is less gory but it comes out scarier than its remake version.  The scenes focus on the actors' expressions instead of filling it up with cinematic gory effects thus leaving more room for the viewers' imagination.

1419339,5,B00005ATQJ,"Kubrick's best films have always, thematically, had much in common with horror films - e.g. the mental and physical decline of confident male heroes; the intrusion of the past on the present; the preference for cavernous interiors - so it is surprising people found his choice to make 'The Shining' an odd one.  It is only odd if you define the term horror within limited boundaries - a formulaic narrative in which everything is reduced to sensation.
Kubrick parodies these boundaries by throwing in every old horror cliche as 'explanation' for the events in the Overlook Hotel (e.g. horrific crime committed there in the past; built on Indian burial grave; the horror narrative as a sublimated account of Jack's marriage, fear of aging etc.).  All these threads are plausible, and do what the horror film has always done - created a mythic or symbolic space where crises, fears, anxieties, repressions etc. are played out, and normality is in some manner restored.
And 'Shining' is deeply satisfying on all these levels: it is, for instance, the best metaphor for marriage since Beckett's 'Happy Days', a heightening of a very real situation - two people forced to spend all their time together, wearing each other down, making each other feel small until the only release is in violence, child abuse, murder etc.  This is a condition for millions of couples around the world, Duvall's voice only a little more grating, Nicholson only a little more mad than the norm.
The film can also be seen as an allegory for America's past, the spirits of African slaves and massacred Indians come back to haunt a nation on the brink of the Reagan years.  it is a film about what happens to man when this Indian period, the Western, is over, and he must turn inwards, must domesticate himself, become female (Jack is a caretaker, his job is to look after a house).  And it is a film about creative failure, writer's block, where inspiration flows everywhere except that white page.
'Shining' could be about all these things and stay within the confines of the horror film.  Kubrick, of course, has never been interested in confines, and 'Shining' plays as the third film in a trilogy that includes '2001' and 'Barry Lyndon', culminating one of the major achievements in the cinema.  As in those films, Kubrick moves beyond mere genre by displacing narrative, with its linear move towards crisis and resolution.  Instead of the past returning to haunt the future, the past, present and future co-exist in a temporal labyrinth, which is reflected in a narrative labyrinth composed of 'reality', dreams, visions, flashbacks, flashforwards etc., with each narrative development repeated or foreshadowed in an endless loop, and physically reflected in the garden maze, whose walls seem to move with Kubrick's camera, and whose model Jack peers over, like a God, or a writer who's just got an idea for a book.
As in '2001' and 'Lyndon', Kubrick conflates time and space in 'Shining', so when Jack walks physically in space, he is also walking through time.  'Shining' often feels like '2001', those endless Steadicam shots like voyages through vast, empty, unpopulated space - the film's opening, with its chillingly articulate officials and large lobby hint at a terrifying voyage ahead.  The use of architectural space and the collapse of narrative into dream logic, with the hero forced to confront his various selves in one time, also echo that film.
Like '2001', 'Shining' is unexpectedly, blackly comic, yet also curiously moving - the Gold Room sequences are among the most resonant in all cinema.  The pay-off is unparalelled and devastating.  Confines indeed.",1000339200,4,3652,4.99835255354201

1419342,4,B00005ATQJ,"""The Shining"" was Stanley Kubrick's first, and only, film in the horror genre.  While not the masterpiece that ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""2001"" was, ""The Shining"" represents a terrific effort by Kubrick and is one of his more recognizable films.
Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel differs, widely, from King's story. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; the novel and film were both good in their own way. Kubrick did, thankfully, edit down the vast amount of material presented in the novel.
The performances are reasonable for a horror film. Jack Nicholson is effective but occasionally a little over the top. Shelley Duvall comes off as being quite annoying when she shrieks in her high, shrill voice. Danny Lloyd is believable as the troubled child, Danny Torrance.
John Alcott's cinematography is superb, particularly, his use of the steadicam in the opening title sequence and in the hallways of the haunted hotel, the Overlook, provides an eerie calm which is quite a contrast to most horror films which tend to be very loud in style.
The moody, unnerving musical score is VERY good at getting one uncomfortable. A good example of its ability to make the audience uneasy is the piece of music played during the beginning title sequence, which provides a real sense of impending doom.
The set design adds greatly to the eerie atmosphere of ""The Shining;"" the striking brightness of the Overlook's walls contrasts nicely with the dark, heated colors of its chaotic-patterned carpets.
""The Shining's"" pacing is rather poor, especially for a horror film. Also, the last 10 or 15 minutes of the film betray the style that was set up by the beginning of the film. The beginning of the film contained very quiet, subdued terror, towards the end Kubrick uses cheap thrills and jack-in-the-box type terror.
This DVD doesn't boast a large amount of extras but I suppose what is given is adequate for this film. The trailer is particularly interesting and quite unlike any trailers you see today. The documentary, while not very long, provides an insightful look as to what went on behind the scenes of ""The Shining.""
""The Shining"" is definitely one of the more effective horror films that I've seen; that's not saying much, though, because lately most of the horror genre has been plagued by ill-conceived films such as ""Scream 3"" and ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.""",997833600,3,2371,4.972292191435768
1419363,5,B00005ATQJ,"I used to think this movie was terrible - overproduced, overlong, and cursed with some of the worst performances in cinematic memory.  Then one night I rented it for a lark and found myself unexpectedly swept up by it.  After the film was over, I went to bed and had one of the worst nightmares of my life, dreaming that I was trapped within the hedge maze and running frantically from a screaming Jack Torrance like Danny in the movie, only I was unable to find my way out of the maze.  I woke up drenched in sweat and didn't sleep for the rest of the night.  Any movie that could do something like this to me must be great!  I have since watched it again, and am astounded by the film's tension, general atmosphere of unease, and I have come to greatly admire the fine acting of all the principals. Kubrick's Overlook Hotel is one of the great sets in the history of filmmaking.  The photography, camera work, and compositions are all spectacular, and the film gains greatly from a truly exquisite use of music (a soundtrack was released very briefly, but it is long out of print).  This film has the simple yet compelling structure of a fairy tale, and some of its images have become mythic in themselves - the unnerving bird's-eye views of Jack's car driving through the forest, Danny cycling through the endless corridors of the hotel and suddenly being confronted with vision of the dead girls, the scene between Jack and the non-existent bartender, the horrific scene where Jack threatens Wendy on the staircase, and of course the final bathroom and maze sequences.  This DVD offers the film in stereo for the first time, and having a stereo soundtrack greatly improves the viewing experience.  And by the way, there is no widescreen version available because this film was not shot in widescreen to begin with - it was filmed in the traditional 1:33 aspect ratio and ""masked"" by Kubrick into a horizontal format when it was released.  What we are seeing now is actually MORE of the total image than was originally seen in theatres, as can be noted if you take a close look at the great opening sequence, where the shadow of the helicopter supporting the camera is quite clearly visible in the lower right corner of the screen for a few seconds.  So stop griping about the widescreen issue, folks, because it isn't going to happen!

This film is a masterpiece. Unlike junk horror films, the fear builds slowly, gradually drawing you in. The camera work (using a technique that Kubrick pioneered, I understand) gives the feeling of being there with her in that haunted hotel.

1419365,5,B00005ATQJ,"If you own the earlier DVD of ""The Shining"", trash (or sell) it; this is the definitive version. Completely remastered from the original negative, the image is incredibly smooth and free of the analog noise and dirt, grain, etc., that plagued the sorry earlier effort (taken from the same aged master used to strike the old VHS and Laserdisc editions). The image is unbelievably pristine, considering Kubrick's fondness for ""pushing"" the film stock, usually resulting in a bit more grain than usual. This is a wonderful picture, and Kubrick, were he still alive, certainly would have approved. Added to this is the terrific new 5.1 sound mix; subtle, but giving the film a newfound, creepy edge (something the old mono-only soundtrack simply couldn't do) and enhancing the jarring musical cues and overall atmosphere of extreme disquiet. As for the issue of widescreen - particularly another reviewer's ill-informed and naive statement that no DVD is worth owning unless it is in widescreen - Kubrick did not shoot any of his films (with the exceptions of ""Spartacus"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") in scope; all were shot ""full frame"" and  ""soft"" matted for theatrical display. In short, you're seeing all (if not more, since the theater matting chopped off the top and bottom) of the image Kubrick composed in-camera.

1419366,5,B00005ATQJ,"You can read Stephen King's masterpiece or watch the late Stanley Kubrick's swan song, but either way you are in for a dark, twisted, foreboding and haunting jaunt.  The idea that King was irate over Kubrick's vision so much that he oversaw a made-for-television venture that all but tanked, had to have been a rumor. For how could the master spellbinder have issues about one the greatest horror films ever to come out of tinseltown?  Ok, so the hedge animals were deleted over a hedge maze. It doesn't really matter. If you watch any other movie adapted from King's work it is clearly apparent that King was given complete authority, because every last one is horribly constructed(except maybe, Misery). King is a writer, not a filmmaker. I think perhaps King was jealous of a man(Kubrick) who brought his idea to life so well, that people thought of the movie as more significant in the years to come than his novel.  As always Kubrick gives us a horrific painting with a pulse. His colors and lighting techniques are second to none. If this were a silent film, it would still chill the spine because of these two elements alone. Enter the music and sound effects and you have a Kubrickian nightmare that you will not be able to escape until the last shocking scene and then some. As far as the actors are concerned the casting is flawless. Nicholson is a bit over the top, but this is a horror film we're talking about. Shelley Duvall is spectacular, but I got the sense that Kubrick hired her to get the audience to root for the Nicholson's devilish persona. In a morbid sense, it's almost like you want Duvall's character to die. The woman she plays is so weak and feeble-minded that its true wonder that she stays alive at all.  Again, this is in-your-face Kubrick. He is a man who has known no boundaries in his filmmaking as he has pushed the corners of creativity and the intensity of the imagination to expand into a cold, unrelenting study in what will disturb us indefinately.  In that respect, I refuse to believe that King was completely disappointed with this film. Insofar as this review is concerned, this is a must see movie.  If you like King, if you like Kubrick and if you like horror films you owe it to yourself to swing your hatchet into this one. Watch it more than once and take in one of King's finest stories and one Kubrick's most haunting interpretations. This may also be one of the only times you will be able to say in confidence that the movie is just as good if not better than the novel that inspired it.",994636800,,2541,4.537117903930131
1419367,5,B00005ATQJ,"...crazy as a loon! When Shelly Duvall started reading page after page, neatly typed and spaced and formed in different paragraphs and indentations, the same sentence over and over it gave me chills, as she and we realize just how crazy her husband has become. This is pure Kubrick, not Stephen King. Frankly, the whole movie is pure Kubrick and very little Stephen King. Thank God. If you want King, see the sorry mini-series.
Only Stanley Kubrick would make a ghost cum haunted house (in this case haunted hotel) movie brightly lit without deep shadows and no one jumping out of the dark shouting ""Boo!"". Even when Jack kills Halloran it is under the brightest light in the room. And the bright lighting of the movie is just the first departure from the usual scarey movie formula.
Nicholson's performance is a point of contention for many. I loved it. His Jack Torrance isn't some nice guy being possessed. He is a deeply disturbed man sliding into total madness. His scene where the months without alcohol has put him to the edge of fury until Lloyd serves him his first drink and the drunk's bravado & expansive b.s. emerges is classic. And when he turns to Wendy who approaches him sitting alone at an empty bar, his just-off-the-mark and a seconds-slow focus and cutting reply to her shows us he's really drunk even if she doesn't see it. As he slides into the abyss, we see Nicholson become abusive and crazy and capable of murdering his own family.
The movie is full of great Kubrick touches: the tracking shot following Danny on his bike with the great sound of the wheels on carpet then floor then carpet then floor; Room 237; REDRUM; ""Here's Johnny!"";the wall of blood; and so on. It also has typically odd points of humor in the performances and direction.
Like all of Kubrick's later movies, I initially felt a sense of disappointment upon first seeing them. Only because I had such anticipation and he had raised his own standard so high it was inevitable it wouldn't match hopeful expectations. But I came to revere every effort on later viewings. Each film is so unique and goes where others haven't. This was true for The Shining as well.
The movie should probably be 4 to 4-1/2 stars. But I miss Kubrick so much, I can't rate it any less than 5. He was a daring and challenging artist, and we will not be able to travel with him to new places any more.

1419369,4,B00005ATQJ,"Among the titles in the new Kubrick DVD Collection (released on June 12, 2001), THE SHINING has the most improved video quality compared to the one from the old Kubrick collection from 1999.  The old SHINING DVD version looked grainy, dirty, and dull.  But the new transfer is clean, sharp, and colors look more vibrant and realistic.  The old mono track has been replaced by a Dolby 5.1 surround track, and the haunting music sounds much better as a result.  The included ""making-of"" documentary also has an improved picture, plus a new audio commentary track by its director Vivian Kubrick (the little girl in 2001).  Much of the 30-minute featurette was shot on the set of THE SHINING, thus it provides a rare, fascinating look at the director at work.  Some memorable moments include Danny Lloyd speculating on how much money he will earn, Scatman Crothers in tears (of joy), Shelley Duvall exchanging some arguments with the director.  Leon Vitali, who supervised the making of the new Kubrick DVD Collection, is also seen as one of Kubrick's assistants.  (The multi-talented Vitali also played the adult Lord Bullingdon in Kubrick's BARRY LYNDON.)  On the commentary track, Vivian Kubrick provides further information about the making of the film and some trivias such as who typed those zillion pages of ""All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.""  One wishes that she had provided a full-length commentary for the movie itself.
The fact that the DVD presents the film in full-screen and, as a result, unmasks a lot of empty, ""dead"" spaces near the top and bottom of the screen that were not seen in theaters, bothers some people, even though it is what Kubrick had intended.  It does not bother me, however.  In a film in which vast, open spaces have a great deal to do with the theme of the story, it seems fitting to add spaciousness to the composition.  Kubrick did make an error in allowing the shadow of a helicopter to be visible in an aerial shot; it would not be visible if the film were letterboxed in its theatrical 1.85:1 ratio.  By the way, THE SHINING and EYES WIDE SHUT are the only titles in the new Kubrick DVD Collection that are labeled as ""presented in the aspect ratio as Stanley Kubrick intended.""  (Does that mean that the other DVDs in the collection are NOT presented as Kubrick intended??  Hmmm...)
The packaging of the new THE SHINING DVD looks very similar to the old one, except the new DVD case has ""Digitally Restored and Remastered"" printed near the top.  The artwork on the new disc is the same as before, but the running time is misprinted as 142 minutes; the film still runs 144 minutes.",994464000,2,2630,4.6949891067538125
1419370,5,B00005ATQJ,"The newly restored and remastered DVD of The Shining is INCREDIBLE!!!!! As a longtime fan of this film and all of Kubrick's work, I bought the original Kubrick DVD set last year and accepted the transfers for what they were. Then it was announced that the NEW Kubrick set was coming out. I rolled my eyes and said to myself that I was finished. That I had had it with all of these ""remastered special editions"" that the studio releases well after the original release just to soak up more profits, blah blah blah, etc, etc. Anyway, that I would NOT buy these new editions because really, how good could they be? Well, recently my local video store bought the new set and had all of the films available for rental. So I thought I'd take a look at The Shining. YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS CLEANUP JOB!!!! Part of what gave The Shining it's charm was it's washed-out look (in my opinion)....MAN, I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THIS MOVIE HAD THE POTENTIAL TO LOOK LIKE!!!!! Seriously, this movie looks like it was shot YESTERDAY (with the exception of Danny's haircut and some seriously 70s carpet designs) the colors are amazing and rich AND THE SOUND IS SO CRISP AND CLEAR!!! I can seriously hear the strings being plucked during the opening theme (Dies Irae, by the way). This is what remastering is all about!!! PRESERVING!!! Not screwing up like with the remastering job on the Jaws DVD (such a hack job, they re-did practically all the sound effects, making the shark sound like it was belching at Brody during the climactic fight.....shiver), Warner Brothers made The Shining brand-new all over again. Plus there's now a running commentary by Vivian Kubrick (Stanley's daughter) during her documentary ""Making of The Shining"" which is very insightful and funny due to her dry wit and English accent (funny in itself since her accent is thick and when we see clips of Kubrick directing he has such a heavy Bronx accent)
Needless to say I ended up buying this DVD, I gave in. How could I not? I don't know if I'll cave in to buying the other ones but if you're a fan of this movie, I'm telling you, BUY THIS DVD. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED....",994377600,,2133,4.557291666666667

1419382,4,B00005ATQJ,"The first time this DVD came out I was VERY disappointed, as were many others.  Not only was it in Mono, but it just did not do the movie justice.  The studio realized it's mistake, thank God!!!  This new version, with 5.1 audio, is awesome!  I watched it 3 times already!  The music is so atmospheric, and moody that it could be a concert in itself.  I wished there was a soundtrack only option on this DVD.  Excellent direction, masterful acting, and scary script.  What more can you ask for?  I would have enjoyed a full length commentary by Nicholson, or Duvall even, but as it is now, I'll take it!  I would have given 5 stars, but lack of any worthwhile special features stopped me.  Enjoy this horror classic, and buy it for generations to come to enjoy as well.",993686400,,769,4.382978723404255
1419383,4,B00005ATQJ,"There is little to add beyond what others have already said, however, I have to wonder why the ""improved"" version still ISN'T WIDESCREEN?!
Other than that, sensational movie, good sound and picture quality.  Definitely on my list of scarriest movies of all time.  Here, Kubrick shows he can give Hitchcock a run for his money, even if only once.",993427200,2,345,4.830508474576271

1419385,5,B00005ATQJ,"I think I'm writing this for the correct version of The Shining because the release date says June 12, 2001 (yet it contains the incorrect cover image and not enough technical features are specified to set it apart from the previous DVD release). Anyway, this newly restored and remastered version of The Shining looks and sound fabulous. Vibrant colors (no bleeding), nice smooth image, nicely detailed, clear Dolby 5.1. The previous abomination of a DVD was one of the worst DVDs to be produced by a major studio. Very grainy, pixely, washed out colors, horrific sound fidelity. They used the transfer for the early eighties VHS edition for that DVD. Ludicrous. This new edition could have used more extras but it includes a delighfully playful commentary by Vivian Kubrick on the documentary she shot on the making on the film. This documentary didn't have the commentary on the previous version and appears to have been remastered as well for this version. Well done! Kinda disappointed in the extras department, but nonetheless, The Shining is nicely preserved on the new DVD edition. Kudos to Warner.",992736000,2,1106,5.016304347826087
1419386,4,B00005ATQJ,"Just because I'm such a helpful sorta fellow I wanted to make sure people were aware of the improvements to this upcoming release of ""The Shining"".  Everything that previous reviewers have said about the last release of ""The Shining"" is true.  The picture transfer and sound are horrible.  However, the upcoming release of this edition corrects all that.  It has a brilliant transfer and a 5.1 Dolby audio track.  Just too bad Kubrick didn't want it released in widescreen.  So, if you love ""The Shining"" don't let the limitations of the previous edition stop you from purchasing the new one.",991958400,8,592,4.87
1419387,2,B00005ATQJ,"""The Shining"" is one of the best Kubrick movies made, but this DVD doesn't even begin to do justice to one of the greatest horror films. First, the sound: recorded in mono, and sounds ten times worse. Second, the picture: some of Kubrick's films have a tendency to look grainy, but this is ridiculous. It looks like it's been sitting on a shelf for the past twenty years, and when through a minimal amount of restoration. The special features are probably the best part of this DVD: there's Vivian Kubrick's ""Making of 'The Shining'"" documentary, a powerful insight behind the scenes of the film, and featuring Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall, Scatman Crothers, Stanley Kubrick, and even an interview with Danny Lloyd! Whatever happened to him anyway? It's pretty neat, even though it was cut by Kubrick from an hour to thirty minutes. There's also a trailer, featuring music by Wendy Carlos. Overall, an average DVD at best, but I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you reaaly love the film that much. I would wait until the new ""Shining"" DVD comes out in June. It has a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, in contrast to this one in mono. In other words, don't buy it!",991440000,5,1167,4.7254901960784315
1419388,4,B00005ATQJ,"""I didn't like The Shining the first time I saw it. But it's one of my favorite films, I maybe saw it about twenty times. But i didn't like The Shining the first time I saw it."" This is what Spielberg says about The Shining when interviewed by Paul Joyce, in the documentary found at the EWS dvd. Well, that's not a bit different from myself experience with this movie. This film has layers of meaning, each time you see it is like you're pulling one of this layers up.  And with sure some fans of Stephen King will not like it, but that's because they want see a simple transfer for the movies of King's book.  I myself always liked King books, I read maybe all the classic King books. But Kubrick is not a entertainment director, this guy is craftsman, he delayed about 5 years inbetween his works to make this movies look like deep masterpieces, since Barry Lyndon this goal is bright clear in Kubrick work. So, Kubrick would never do a simple transfer of King's book, he saw in adapting this book a way of grafting in it his own authoral work. Therefore if you like art films you'll enjoy it, without of course judging it for being, at least at surface, a horror movie.",990835200,,1173,4.351598173515982
1419389,5,B00005ATQJ,"This movie once again shows Stanley Kubrick's skill for completely re-thinking a film genre, and still making a great movie.  The Shining is a very eerie film with plenty of psycological twists that will leave you asking questions for days.  Kubrick took many specific steps in the production of this movie to make it different from other horrors.  For example, the entire movie is filmed in full light, instead of nearly complete darkness (which seems to be the trend lately).  Yet, this does not subtract from the value of the film, in fact I think it adds to it's uniqueness.  If you keep an open mind throughout this movie, then you will absolutely LOVE it.",990144000,,661,4.71304347826087
1419390,5,B00005ATQJ,"Don't listen to any card-carrying Stephen King groupie, this movie is better than the book. I know what you're thinking, but the challenge of bringing a sick weirdo's (King) book as thick as your arm to life on the screen and within two hours is one thing. To recreate, and in some areas, out ""freak"" the original is a superhuman achievement. Kubrick is a master. This is the only horror movie worth watching. A classic.

1419391,5,B00005ATQJ,"I have just bought the DVD of this film and although it is a little light on features, the film still er... ""shines"" (sorry!).
There is an air of tension and creepiness throughout this film which I can only attribute to the clever camera shots which give the impression that the film's protagonists are being constantly watched.  Not in an obvious handheld POV shot either, but in slow tracking shots that follow the subject from a distance, something of a Kubrick trademark.
The script always gives the impression that something very bad is about to happen, with some amazing mundane-sounding by ultimately portentious dialogue, particularly in the scene with Jack and the Overlook Hotel's manager and in the scene with Wendy and the social worker discussing Danny's 'accident'.
As far as the DVD is concerned, the picture quality and sound are quite poor (especially in the accompanying documentary), however, this does not detract from the overall quality of the DVD, such is the quality of film itself.  And at least, being on DVD, it won't get any worse, unlike my PAL VHS copy...
An essential purchase then.
NB:  For those of you with widescreen TVs who are worried about the 4:3 ratio, don't worry - Kubrick filmed many of his films in 4:3 but framed them so they could be matted them to 1.66:1 for convention's sake, so you'll find that the 14:9 (or even the 16:9) zoom setting on your TV will look fine.",988243200,3,1412,4.755102040816326

7935985,3,B00005ATQJ,"Although The Shining has a palpably creepy atmosphere and enough suspense to clog a black hole, too many flaws keep it from being believable, let alone horrifying. For one, take lead actor, Jack Nicholson. He camps up the madness of his character to such a degree that he's halfway to insanity by the time he arrives at the hotel. Constant eyebrow and pupil acrobatics coupled with one too many villainous grins prove to be more distracting for the viewer than they are for giving a convincing portrayal of escalating madness. Shelley Duvall plays his wife, but loses focus numerous times throughout the film, resulting in an erratic performance which often leaves her looking lost and dopey. Slightly less important, yet noticeable is the complete lack of chemistry between Nicholson and Duvall as a married couple. Danny Lloyd (who plays the part of their son) gives a fairly credible performance, but Nicholson's self-aggrandizing performance makes the father-son connection completely implausible.

It's evident Kubrick was mainly preoccupied with creating suspense. The film is saturated with it. Sadly, all this effort on the part of the director never pays off for the viewer. One waits and waits, but whenever a key horror scene occurs, it's neither shocking nor horrifying. Nicholson's over-the-top acting coupled with the director's lack of restraint, or, in other words, his penchant for showing everything, spoils the movie. Little has been left up to the imagination, so the fright factor gets neutralized. All ""scary"" scenes provided by Kubrick appear contrived with everything well-lit, clear, and picture-perfect. Even the ghosts, or lost souls, look as much alive as the living do. Kubrick tried too hard to prepare the viewer for a scare with his deliberate audio and visual assaults, but this method did nothing but yield a kind of spoon-fed horror. The Shining has been hyped for years as one of the greatest, if not THE greatest horror movie ever made. This claim is perpetuated by people who are easily taken by Nicholson's canned villainous antics, or by those who believe that Kubrick was a genius (never stopping to think that he might not have been the man for all movie genres). Kubrick certainly wasn't the man for directing horror pictures. It's no wonder that Stephen King doesn't approve. (2.5 stars)",1521936000,,2331,5.13421052631579
