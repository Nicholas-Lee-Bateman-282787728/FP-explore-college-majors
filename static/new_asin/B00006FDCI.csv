1746611,5,B00006FDCI,Outstanding! This is one of the best comedies that I have seen. (I saw it in the theatre when it first came out.),1142640000,3,113,3.9565217391304346
1746612,5,B00006FDCI,"In this whole boxset when i first got it i had only seen ""Nuts"" the most underrated Streisand film it has the quality OF A GREAT PERFORMANCE , The performance was superb this movie should have at least been nominated for an Acadamy Award for best actress The Supporting cast was also Great.""Up The Sandbox"" is another great movie it shows great things that Margret ( Streisand) went through its one of my favorite streisand films. The Main Event was good at some parts but not the greatest streisand film. Whats Up Doc is defenitly a great screwball comody. This movie really had some great and memorable moments. So if you like Barbra or any of these films its a good boxset to buy.",1115856000,6,683,4.516129032258065
1746613,4,B00006FDCI,"'What's Up Doc?' is a five-star movie, no doubt about that. Streisand's best role probably, and a film that's so well made it will be watched for years to come. It's so good, people tend to learn half the script to quote in everyday life. But we knew that was good.
I wanted to have that on DVD, and thought I may as well, considering the price, have three other movies as a bonus.
The best of the rest is 'Nuts', and Barbra gives a truly compelling performance alongside an excellent Dreyfuss. It's a good pairing. The script is good, and the movie, whilst not exactly ground breaking, is pretty good.
'Up the Sandbox' is a curiosity, but not entirely a success. What I do like is Barbra's rather ordinary character Margaret, which she plays with understatement and compassion. What I don't like is when her fantasies are extended into fifteen minute epics, one like a very poor James Bond episode, and one tedious African jungle adventure. The director used poor judgement here. Still, it's an interesting period piece, and I love the bit when Barbra shoves her mother's head into her birthday cake...
'The Main Event' is dreadful. It's the clunker of the four. Our Barbra, sporting a hideous hairdo of tight red curls, plays a woman who coaches a boxer who dropped out after an earlier incident, and there are scenes of boxing, training, and guess what happens at the end? It's impossible to make it sound interesting. The plot is tedious, the script awful and the actors desperate-seeming. The only good thing about this DVD is that it props up the other ones in the box set.
But hey, you're still getting 'What's Up Doc?' so who's complaining?
The bonus is that there are good extra features on the DVDs: commentary by Barbra herself, then the director, and one or two ther bits and pieces, like a mini-documentary from US TV about the making of 'Up the Sandbox'. The commentary is from 2003, so it's nicely up to date and offers an interesting view of the past by actors and directors.",1101168000,5,1991,4.627118644067797
1746614,5,B00006FDCI,"Every movie here is great, and very differnt from one another! Barbras Warner Years were very eclectic, Sandbox seems to get better with age, The Main Event has always been funny and entertaining, Nuts is drama at its best and then theres the gem of them all Whats Up Doc, Barbra is hysterical, Madeline Cahn is Hysterical, The whole Movie is one great laugh, a ride you want to go on time and time again!!!",1061337600,8,407,4.44
1746615,5,B00006FDCI,"It's really unfortunate that the first review posted on this site regarding this DVD set is by someone who is rude and disgusting. I don't ever want to read about someone deficating.  Ok you didn't like it, but do you have to be so sick and cruel on top of it? Streisand is far from washed up. LOL
I'm a long time fan and Barbra's new DVD set is wonderful.  I personally liked ""What's Up Doc"" the best and appreciated the featurette on the filming of the movie. I think the selection offers great variety on part of her film career and shows diversity in her acting roles.  ""Up The Sandbox"" is a special film and one that everyone who is even curios about Streisand should watch.  It shows a whole different side of her and her performance is very genuine.  I highly recommend this box set.",1058745600,11,790,4.346938775510204
1746616,5,B00006FDCI,"...So, being someone who has actually seen these films, let's be fair.  WHAT'S UP DOC is a terrific example of a screwball comedy with a winning cast.  Barbra Streisand is laugh-out-loud funny, with spot-on timing and is sexy and tanned to boot on screen. UP THE SANDBOX, dramatically, is unlike anything Streisand ever did before or after... it took courage to take-on a role like this, and she can be proud of the ""real woman"" qualities that she brought to the role.  THE MAIN EVENT is a good try... it has its funny moments and Streisand gives it her best.  It's just not a terrific script.  NUTS, however, is underrated... not only is the supporting cast superb, but Streisand gave a performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination.  In all fairness, this is a terrific and enjoyable set, by an artist who has given much to the world of entertainment.  Highly Recommended!!!!!",1058486400,25,882,4.7631578947368425
1746617,5,B00006FDCI,"As a devoted Streisand fan, these four films are a welcome addition to the rest of the DVD's that are already out!  I am especailly thrilled about What's Up Doc and Nuts.  Anytime that Barbra sinks her teeth into a project, you get star quality and devotion to the craft of acting.
I too like another reviewer is anticipating the day that YENTL will come out on DVD. That will be a day that I will gladly call in sick to work so that I can be pain free with glee!",1056153600,9,463,4.076923076923077

I saw them all in the movie theaters when they first came out. Barbra revisited. What's Up Doc? One of the zaniest movies of all time. Laugh a minute. Nuts- a great story about a hooker's family secret. The Main Event- Barbra has Pro boxer Ryan O'neil's contract. Ryan couldn't break an egg in the kitchen,forget the boxing ring! Up The Sandbox- a 1970s movie satire about the woman's equal rights movement.
Barbra's somewhat obscure films but as a Barbra fan,saw them all. I guess this box set is very scarce due to Barbra's commentary on each movie. Well,i am very pleased i ordered this treasure. I am watching What's Up Doc? A great cast. Madeline Kahn,was hilarious. Ditto Barbra. I recommend these films very well. Do yourself a favor and check these movies out. They are treasures.",1420588800,,805,4.757142857142857

1746776,2,B00006FDCI,"What's Up Doc gets funnier and funnier as the years go by. You can keep the rest of the stuff here. What we need is Peter Bogdanovich's first three films as a box set - The Last Picture Show, What's Up Doc and Paper Moon. Many of the same actors in repertory, all three brilliant and all quite different. How about it Amazon?",1274400000,,325,4.174603174603175

7967759,5,B00006FDCI,I loved this movie. I remember going to the movies to see it as a kid and it really stuck with me. I never thought of Barbara Streisand as sexy but always thought Ryan O'Neal was a good actor in the 70's and early 80's even though ( he turned out to be a real prick. ) The chemistry and camaraderie between Streisand and O'Neal in this movie is amazing.,1465516800,,353,4.057142857142857

7967762,4,B00006FDCI,"The Main Event is a reunion for Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal (they both starred together in the hilarious screwball comedy ""What's Up Doc?"") and it has it's funny moments with the renewed chemistry they share. I saw it years ago upon it's release (yes, I'm not a young spring chicken) and after watching it again I still found it entertaining today. The plot-a bit hokey-is funny but it's the bandying script and tasteful one liners that really make the movie. Look for a young Brent Musburger interviewing both stars. The Main Event is worth watching if you like witty dialogue and some good physical comedy.",1445472000,,613,4.7924528301886795
