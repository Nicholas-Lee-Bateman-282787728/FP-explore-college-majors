8598802,4,B00DX5WK66,Great quality and footage of their concert! The only thing that really bothered me was that every song was a compilation of performances from different shows put together. I wish they stuck with one show and played only that instead of showing us bits of each show to make one song.,1394841600,,282,4.549019607843137
