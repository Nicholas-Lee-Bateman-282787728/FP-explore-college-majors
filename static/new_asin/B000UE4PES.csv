8213042,1,B000UE4PES,"Save your money. This DVD is so lame. I wish there were a no star rating. Poor quality camera work, terribly boring and limited shots of fish. I turned around and listed it for sale the day after I got it. Sorry if you are the person that bought it from me. God is this one a stinker. If you want good fish videos, I have purchased almost everything from Amazon related to coral reef video (for showing in my medical center)and other than one other one (which I also gave two thumbs down review on Amazon, this one is by far the worst. Pick another one, especially Plasmaquarium and the IMAX videos.",1207872000,6,599,4.3097345132743365
