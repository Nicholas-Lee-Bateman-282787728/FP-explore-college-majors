It is NOT available in NTSC format but pure PAL. That's why I gave it a 4! Make sure you have a player that can play PAL formatted discs. Most computers with Windows Media Player will be able to play it without any problems.

In summary, I'm glad I purchased this item.",1158883200,8,437,4.141176470588236
