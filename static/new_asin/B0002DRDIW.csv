2080669,5,B0002DRDIW,I love this movie!!! it is the best movie ever!!!!!!!!! it has so many things that poor hispanics and go through. Its kind of sterotypical but it is still a good movie!!! Yeah it is kinda of rough but it shows so much reality. It has sooooooo much drama and things just happen so randomly. I love this movie i would watch it every day if i could!!!,1126569600,,348,4.132352941176471

2080671,5,B0002DRDIW,"This movie reminds me of back in the dayz, growing up in Kali, I enjoyed because it puts out there the issues chicana girls have growing up, for other people that don't quite get Chicana Life this movie will help you understand, even though now in dayz it's not that harsh, growing up in city like L.A ,  the barrio is your familia if you want to survive the gang streets.... a must see movie overall!!! Chicana Love, La Traviesa",1120694400,3,429,4.3625
2080672,5,B0002DRDIW,this is a real good movie. better than american me in my opinion. when i first bought it i thought it would be okay but it turned out to be better than i thought. its about 2 best friends who turn on eachother after they both get pregnant by tha same drug dealer. after he dies they later realize always choose ur homegirl before any boy. tha story goes on about other events. tha only thing i didn't like about it was that i thought it ended too early. other than that this is a real good movie...,1119916800,,498,4.091836734693878
2080673,5,B0002DRDIW,"I remember mi tio takin me, mi hermana y una amiga to see this movie and thinkin I'd hate it... boy was I wrong.  This movie turned out to be one of my all-time favorite movies.  I have been waiting years for it to be released on DVD.  I recorded it countless times when HBO showed it.  One thing about this movie is that the cast is great even though they aren't big names in the biz.  I esp. love Jacob Vargas cuz man is hot!!!!  All the actors are great and they each remind of someone I know or knew in some way or another.  All in all this movie may have been an indie but it is a damn good movie.  If ya buy ya won't regret it.",1093305600,6,633,3.8153846153846156

2080714,5,B0002DRDIW,"Allison Anders is one of my favorite directors & I think this film is her best. It's a great, well written story about teenage girls growing up in Echo Park in the early '90s. If you know anything about Echo Park now it is being taking over by gentrification. In the '90s though it was home to a Latin@ population. The story focuses on the friendship of 2 teenage girls & the teenage boy that comes between them & is their baby daddy. Yes, each of them has a baby by him. He ends up being killed & the girls & their rivalry & become friends again. I like this movie b/c the dialogue is very real & well written. Watch this movie if you're interested in '90s fashion & strong female characters. This movie's central characters are fully developed, well rounded women. The ending may surprise & shock you, but that's one of my favorite parts of this movie.",1464566400,4,854,4.34375

2080721,5,B0002DRDIW,How can you not love this movie. I watched this growing up and it helped me understand the people around me and all the crazy stuff that would happen in the area I am from. You come to love and care for these characters and laugh and cry with them and for them. I would recommend this movie to a mature audience that can look past the violence and see the story for what it is.,1461628800,,377,3.973684210526316

2080726,5,B0002DRDIW,I watched this movie years and years ago and finally found it and was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed all these years later watching it. Still loved it. Sad in many ways yes. Not really a life I can relate to personally yet the whole point of the struggles of women and single mothers and everyday problems is all relatable. It may seem as though it's a million miles away from some of us yet the characters are all relatable to a degree. There's a little bit of each of us in them. You will find yourself cheering these girls on to make a better life for themselves and their children.,1456876800,4,588,4.306306306306307

2080825,3,B0002DRDIW,"""Mi Vida Loca/My Crazy Life"" is yet another entry in the East LA Chicano gang lifestyle. It's not the worst movie in the genre I've ever seen, but for me it was hard to find redeeming qualities in most of the characters. The two main characters, Sad Girl and Mousie, are at odds over a punk who just was not worth it, so when they are calling him ""strong"" and hearing him say that he was ""going to take care of them,"" I just had to chuckle. As a former Parole Officer, I used to see that flawed thinking in action all the time. In fact, many of these characters were so stereotypical that the entire movie almost seemed like satire to me. It always amazes me to see people talking about how hard life is when they are downing 40-ounce beers and smoking like chimneys! Whether or not this is an accurate reflection of gang life from the female perspective, I do not know. Still, it was a colorful movie. My personal favorite scenes involved the character Alicia ""La Blue Eyes,"" a beautiful dreamer who, while avoiding the hopeless gang life, still gets caught up in some aspects of it. Overall, not a bad movie, and it had many surprises, like a rousing performance by Los Lobos and Salma Hayek as a jilted Chicana.",1334016000,,1214,4.4

There are times when the acting isn't the best, but the characters are believable and the scenarios presented could happen in Echo Park or any other barrio.  While most movies like this focus on men, this movie shows the women coming together in some unexpected ways.  It also shows male characters who are well-rounded in their range of emotions.

2080842,2,B0002DRDIW,"My main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in late 2004.

It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs, dropping-out, and  domestic violence. And it's all here, told through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played.

I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever!

As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily, it's just a coincidence.",1134432000,8,808,4.709219858156028
2080843,4,B0002DRDIW,"When I first saw this film, some five years ago, it truly knocked the breath out of me.  For the first time, director Allison Anders gives us a glimpse into Mexican-American gang life in East LA's Echo Park, from the female perspective, this time.  In the past, we have seen our share of male experiences (example being Zoot Suit, written by the playwright Luis Valdez).  For once, we see the gritty side of the gang life, as young Mexicanas (or Chicanas, depending on who you ask) struggle to stay alive, amidst rampant drug dealing, the violence of gang initiation and their relationships with men who are less than honorable to them.

Mi Vida Loca is actually a trilogy of stories.  (Mousie & Sad Girl, Lowrider and La Blue Eyes)  The first is the story of a life long friendship between fellow gang members, Mousie (Seidy Lopez) and Sad Girl (Angel Aviles).  These young women are best friends, until the day that Sad Girl sleeps with Mousie's boyfriend, Ernesto (Jacob Vargas), and becomes pregnant with his child.  The world they knew before is ruptured, as is their lifelong connection as friends.  The second story takes a glimpse in LowRider culture.  This culture is perpetuated by, predominantly, young Chicanos who build their lives around re-finishing and airbrushing ""low rider"" cars (many, old school Chevies), complete with flashy airbrush images (example being voluptuous women and gang affiliations), trick tires and rims.  This story is actually a wonderful example of modern magical realism, when the car takes on a life of its own.  The third story is centered around La Blue Eyes, a beautiful BROWN-EYED woman who is writing to a convict, that she falls in love with through the exchange of letters.  The question is, when they finally meet, will the sum of those letters even measure up to their encounter, or has the young woman ultimately been deceived, the whole time?

I reccomend this film, if not for the fact that it is compelling, but that this is an important culture in society we should all learn something more about.  A very important study in gang life, and how it evolves in a neighborhood that many only hear about on the evening news, but never get to know.",1127433600,30,2197,4.805851063829787
