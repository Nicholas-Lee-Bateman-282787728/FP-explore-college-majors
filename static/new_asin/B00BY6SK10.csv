For those of you that haven't seen this, let me tell you: it's like the boys version of Lucky Star: No romance (straight or yaoi), and just basically what the title is: Daily Lives of High School Boys. I laughed so hard, though! You'll love it. If you don't, then I have no idea why not.",1378598400,3,479,3.9381443298969074
5681727,4,B00BY6SK10,"War has be raging for years between the Levamme Empire and the Amatsukami Imperium. But love can blossom in any condition - as the prince of Levamme discovers upon laying eyes on the lovely Juana del Moral. Sadly, the Amatsukami take it upon themselves to prevent the marriage from happening by killing off the bride. So the San Maltilia Airforce comes up with a wild plan - transport the lady to her prince on the mainland via a single plane. The mission is given to a mercenary pilot of mixed blood named Charles.
The journey will be more dangerous and more life changing then either Juana or Charles could have ever imagined....

This was a very relaxing and beautiful show. Not that it wasn't exciting at times, but it was very easy to watch. The story is fairly simple and the cast small. The scenery and the airplanes were beautifully animated. The ending is bittersweet, but not unexpected.

This set comes with a 32-page hardcover art book filled with detailed character info, rough sketches, artist interviews, and setting illustrations. Japanese audio only, with English subtitles. Special features are thin, with only Japanese Commercials and Theatrical Previews. Book and disc are stored in a nice art box.

PS Currently (as of 3/3/14), there is a anime airing called The Pilot's Love Song, which is supposed to be a prequel of sorts to this movie.",1375401600,8,1360,4.828326180257511

5681729,5,B00BY6SK10,I just finished watching this on Hulu and oh ma jesus I have to say it is one of the best animes I have ever seen. It's such a sweet story and didn't have one of those awkward scenes that didn't make sense to the story line. It was soooooooo good. Absolutely loved it,1424217600,,267,3.962962962962963

Or why high-school girls were so loud and abrasive?
Well, this anime answers all those questions and does it with flare, spontaneity and random acts of side-splitting idiocy!
From geeks to bullies and outcasts to siblings who pretended not to know you...or vice versa; this has just about every awkward peer or rival moment you remember...or wish you could forget.",1403568000,2,413,5.088235294117647
5681734,5,B00BY6SK10,"Superb Japanese animated movie about an ace pilot escorting a soon to be princess through enemy lines into the capitol. A simple plot yes, but one that makes for an excellent adventure filled with feel good moments and great action sequences.  Lots of little details, great character development, great soundtrack, great visuals and a great job from the Japanese voice actors. I was never bothered by the CG used, It would've been better if it was all hand-drawn of course.... but cg worked just fine. My only complain is that some of the moves look to defy physics in many ways so there isn't much realism in the aviation part. Of course, Im not knowledgeable in the subject of aviation but just by looking you'll know some of the stunts aren't possible in real life. On the other hand, its a fantasy world different from ours so I let it go quickly. People expecting something like Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D or some other action filled anime flick should look elsewhere. But if you enjoy stuff like the slower Ghibli movies, The Girl who leapt through Time, Colorful, etc. then you'll find a greatly enjoyable adventure in The Princess and The Pilot.",1400198400,3,1157,4.727722772277228
5681735,1,B00BY6SK10,"I thought it was a pretty standard movie overall, nothing really out of the ordinary. I was bored most of the way through. I had to roll my eyes at that cheesy ending though, it was so frustrating to see the pilot just throw away all of his gold like that! All that hard work for nothing. The most exciting part for me was when the pilot unexpectedly gets shot, because it was interesting to see the pilot struggle from then on. I thought they really pushed the racism aspect a bit too hard, we got it the first couple of times they said it, I just hate when they try to shove themes down our throats.

Since the drama/romance was pretty strong in this one, and the themes mostly didn't appeal to me, I don't feel I am qualified to rate this one. Whenever I run into this situation I always put the anime on my dropped list even though I actually completed it. I only kept watching this one for the dogfights, and also to see what would happen in the end. But I was left with an empty feeling inside after it was all over.(Watched online by the way.)",1391299200,2,1050,4.198019801980198
5681736,3,B00BY6SK10,"Saizo Kirigakure is hanging out in the woods one day when the priestess Isanami stumbles across his path. She is being pursued by assassins, but lucky for her, Saizo is a legendary ninja, and he reluctantly whoops the attacker's butts. He then tries to go on his merry way, but Isanami tempts him with an offer of soba. She asks him to take her to Ueda Castle to see Sanada Yukimura, which eventually leads to him to becoming Isanami's bodyguard and one of Yukimura's Brave 10, a group of legendary warriors with the power to change history.

This show is entertaining. Its got lots of characters with different powers and lots of fighting. I enjoy history, so it is fun to see all the  famous people and laugh at how they are portrayed. Sanada Yukimore was a real person during the Warring States Period of Japan, though the Brave 10 are a legend. Some of the Braves have names that belonged to real people while others are fictional (Kirigakure Saiz is a real person, Sarutobi Sasuke is not).

The plot is a little thin at times and there isn't lots of character development (and most characters are stereotypes). It doesn't have much of an ending (probably doesn't cover all of the manga), though if it follows history you can figure out what comes after.

I enjoyed it, but mostly as a one viewing time killer. I wanted to give it a 3.5, but Amazon doesn't allow that and it isn't good enough to be bumped up to 4.
If you like ninjas, ninja battles, or historical fiction (with fantasy), then this is a fun show to watch.
NIS America releases nice sets. It contains 2 Blu-ray disks in a hardcover slipcase and a full-color, 32-page hardcover art book complete with episode guide, character and world descriptions, production and key art, and more. Bonus features are slim, limited to clean opening and ending, Japanese commercials, and Japanese trailers. The series is only 12 episodes long and there is no English dub.

Purchase tip: If you buy directly from NIS America, the set is generally cheaper, has free shipping, and comes with a Chibi Warrior Fan (while supplies last).",1386115200,5,2083,4.664850136239782
5681737,5,B00BY6SK10,"Tadakuni, Yoshitake, and Hidenori are three ordinary high school boys, but their imaginations lead them on some fun and wacky adventures. They host radio shows, fight off monsters, and dress up Tadakuni in his sister's school uniform. Throw in their classmates from an all boys school and the girls from an all girls school, a girl on a riverbank who speaks in poetry, and other random people, and and you get to see what a typical high school boy's life is like...

This series is so funny and lots of fun. The stories generally run just a few minutes, so there are several of them in each episode. Then after the credits there is the short High School Girls are Funky, showing that high school girls are nearly as weird as the boys. I, having never been a high school boy and never known any, was both thoroughly amused by their antics and by assurances from several people that it is a very accurate portrayal of real high school boys.

The series is 12 episodes followed by at least another episodes worth of additional stories (they will play automatically, or you can find them in special features). Other special features are clean opening and endings, and the Japanese commercials. Set also includes a full-color, 32-page hardcover art book that contains detailed character bios, school ""guidelines"" based on the episodes, as well as additional artwork.

Purchase tip: right now this set is available from NIS America (the makers of the set) for $51.99 and free shipping on orders over $19.99. But even better is that (while supplies last) this set will include an authentic North Sanada High Tie! So you too can be a high school boy!",1386028800,6,1642,4.734265734265734
8575247,4,B00BY6SK10,"- Synopsis: Join in on the adventures  of our main character as trouble follows him due to associating with a certain someone that was being hunted. At first he didn't want anything to do with her, until she was able to persuade him to help by buying him food. From there, his once simple lifestyle turns into constant skirmishes that will test his skills and determination. Along the way, he meets a variety of allies, as well as dangerous foes. How will the fate of our heroes end, in this anime that takes us back far into Japan's historical war-torn periods.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Pretty cool anime. The main character reminds me of protagonists like Ragna (BlazBlue). He gives off the vibe that he wants to be left alone and is not afraid to say it. But he does have a soft spot, just like my boy, Ragna.

Unlike many other main characters from other animes, he knows how to fight quite well. He is a ninja with a giant sword, which is surprising since ninjas in most anime prefer compact weapons for reasons such as concealing them. There isn't too much of a backstory, so if you want a simple anime to follow along with some interesting characters, this one is pretty good.

Fight scenes are satisfying, as well as seeing some interesting character development and some entertainingly silly scenes. Furthermore, the main character is just a nice refreshing change of pace from many other main characters since he isn't your standard protagonist. If it were up to him, he'd rather not get involved in anything that could be a hassle. Smart man.

- Features: Japanese audio with English subs. Includes 8 episodes on the first disc, and 4 on the second disc, for a total of 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays. Run time of about 5 hours long. Rated TV-14 for violence, and some fan-service.

In the end, he does not throw it all away like the one star review suggested and there were no holes in the plot like the three star review suggested, she clearly gave a reason why the prince sent the message, hence why pilot came up with the conclusion. Simply amazing anime. They should really make a part 2, it would truly be something to go out of your way to watch.

8575253,4,B00BY6SK10,"We will be casting off our Anime reviews with The Princess and the Pilot, or ""To Aru Hikushi e no Tsuioku"" which has been published and released here in the United States by NISA. The Princess and the Pilot is a feature-length film that is just under 100 minutes in length and was animated by Madhouse, the stunning team behind Black Lagoon, Gungrave, Sunday Without God, and Metropolis to name a few (they have animated dozens of excellent anime).

The Princess and the Pilot was then produced by the brilliant folks at TMS Entertainment, the team behind franchises like Lupin III (original), God Mazinger, D.Gray Man, various Bakugan arcs, and OVA's including Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas and Rayearth. Needless to say, The Princess and the Pilot has some muscle behind it and it shows in the BluRay that you can purchase direct from NISA at http://www.nisamerica.com/Princess-Pilot

Following the story of Charles Karino, a mixed-nationality mercenary flying for the Empire of Levamme in their war against the Amatsukami Imperium. It is important to note that Charles is born from a Levamme father and a Amatsukami mother and is therefore titled a ""bestado,"" something of a bastard child of nations and is treated as lower than the lowest caste of nationalities. This form of segregation and racism plays a role in the development of Charles and is a distinct factor when considering the overall plot of the movie. Given that Charles is generally treated like trash, it comes to a massive surprise to him that he is to transport an extremely important person through the front lines of the war and on to the capital in the new reconnaissance model aircraft, the Santa Cruz.

This is where the movie's other main character is brought in as she is to be the Princess consort, engaged to the Levamme Empire's current Prince, one Juana del Moral. A women of renowned beauty, with her pale skin and flowing silver hair. During the start of the war tragedy strikes Juana which prompts the dangerous and highly secretive mission to fly her through enemy lines and on to the capital of the Levamme Empire.

The animation is stunning, with beautiful views of ocean vistas, massive thunderheads over the open seas, and sprawling jungle islands, though it is at times broken up by the computer-generated models of aircraft that look almost too sharp against the hand-painted backdrops and hand-drawn character models. In a refreshing departure from today's fanservice-heavy anime industry, there is very little, if any hypersexualization seen in The Princess and the Pilot, which allows the viewer to focus on the story of two people of wildly different classes connecting as they experience one trial after the next. What really touched me is that the movie showed the opening up of a shy young woman to a man conflicted with maintaining his position as her pilot and protected and a man that is just as awkward as his charge. Seeing that relationship grow on screen resonated with me more so than other anime that I have seen.

As expected from a production company like TMS Entertainment, the audio is spectacular given who the seiyu were. For instance, Ryunosuke Kamiki, who voices Charles will be instantly recognized as Markl from Howl's Moving Castle or Boh from Spirited Away. Though, Taketomi Sieka the seiyu for Juana del Moral is not as well known in the anime world, she has been featured in numerous drama series'. Others, such as Daisuke Ono, who plays Carlo in The Princess In the Pilot are far better known for roles such as Snow Villiers in the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy, or his role in numerous anime series and videos (such as Erwin Smith in Attack on Titan or Kazuma Yagami in Kaze no Stigma or Sasaki from Clannad After Story).

Just before the credits begin to roll, there is a few lines of written dialog that close out the story and provide a bit of background of what happens after the movie ends, though it is not enough to truly cap off the story, it is enough to leave you wanting just a bit more.

While I thoroughly enjoyed The Princess and the Pilot as a video I do wish that there was a little more closure towards the end, but barring that and the need for some extras, whether it is a behind the scenes or a making-of, the blu ray is relatively devoid of any extra contents, The Princess and the Pilot is a great story that should be experienced by all.",1435017600,,4380,4.747700394218134

8575256,3,B00BY6SK10,"Good animation, especially the flying scenes.  But the plot and its holes leave a lot unanswered questions.  The pilot is tasked to secretly transport the princess to a another country for her wedding.  But as soon as they depart, the duo encounter enemy aircraft searching for them from day one.  The pilot deduces that someone must have leaked their flight path to the enemy.  In the end, there is no resolution on how the enemy knew about the mission.

The disc comes in an unwieldy and large box which will not fit on a normal bookshelf for movies.  The disc holder itself is a very thin clamshell which is a good deal narrower than normal disc holders and does not have a spine large enough to show the title.",1424908800,,714,4.488372093023256
