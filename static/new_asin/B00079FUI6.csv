2205715,5,B00079FUI6,"I started watching this show thinking ""this'll be cancelled,"" as most of my favorite shows do, (i.e ""Pasadena."")

But fortunately, it had a wonderful reception and is so strong! Owing to many facors, including FABULOUS acting by the the 5 Housewives, especially Marcia Cross and Teri Hatcher (who won her first Golden Globe for her performance,) and genius writing! The show has elements of anything you can think of: romance, suspense, drama, comedy (sorry to whoever used this same thing before!)

And I'm overjoyed that 'Desperate Housewives' will get its DVD debut in August 2005! Thank goodness!

So, if you're looking for a laugh, a cry, or just a look at a wonderful show, tune into ABC for DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.",1105920000,10,719,4.975
2205716,5,B00079FUI6,"This show has it all - comedy, suspense, drama, romance ... this is the best written show in a such a long time.  The main 4 ladies along with Nicolette Sheridan bring so much to this show.  Even the minor characters, like Paul, Mike, are so good.  Can't wait for the DVD in August!",1105920000,5,282,4.185185185185185
2205717,5,B00079FUI6,"Wow!  I thought that when Friends was over that I would never laug again.  I'm so glad that DHs has come along - and now it's going to be on DVD!, it's like the best of Ally McBeal meets Footballers Wives (from the UK - if you haven't seen it, you should!), with Six Feet Under sprinkles!

So, if you are going to watch anything this year - THIS IS GOTTA BE IT!!

When the pilot first shewed - I wasn't sure, but once I had seen the third show I was HOOKED!  I am sure you feel the same.  All I can say is - it is WRONG that the producers of this show consistently fail to put this shew out and give us what we all want!

Looking forward to series 3!",1105056000,3,650,3.8059701492537314

2205751,5,B00079FUI6,I have watched every episode of this and found it to very entertaining.  Didn't watch it here though as I refuse to pay for this when I am already a prime member which isn't cheap.  This is a very frustrating issue I have with Amazon.  This is a show that started 12 years ago!!!! IMHO all seasons of this should be FREE for prime members.  I have quite a few shows and movies saved in my watch list just waiting until they are free and I am not talking about new or even newer releases.  Some are 15 or more years old that I enjoyed and wouldn't mind seeing again but as stated above I won't pay for it.  We will see who has it free first Netflix or Amazon.,1461196800,,658,4.023076923076923

2205773,5,B00079FUI6,"When we got bored on a Mediterranean cruise 5 years ago, season one was on shipboard TV.  Neither of us had seen DH before. We both got hooked after one episode. Scripted comedy with 4 memorable, well-drawn females, battling their men and each other on Wisteria Lane, the suburb from hell and scene of more murder and mayhem than the Sopranos, and nearly as well done. Scratch that. AS well done. We ended up getting the complete deluxe collectors' edition. Guys, I'm telling ya.

2205795,3,B00079FUI6,"Enjoyed it.

I had caught a few episodes on television, and I was intrigued enough to want to watch this series.  I wasn't able to see every episode of the first season until I purchased the DVD.  It was quirkier and funnier than I thought.

The writing is smart, and I love the characters.  They are all so different.  Character I feel most empathy for is Lynette Scavo/Felicity Huffman, though Brie Van de Camp/Marcia Cross is my favorite character, because her rigidity is hilarious.

Happy that there was a conclusion to the overall mystery.  To be insufferably dragged along wears me out.  You can only be compelled for so long.",1417910400,,633,4.681818181818182

2205853,5,B00079FUI6,Love this show.  I thought it sounded stupid until I caught a few episodes on TV and got hooked and had to buy the whole series. It is hilarious.,1355011200,,145,4.0
2205854,4,B00079FUI6,"My taste in television shows is quite varied, but some of my favorites are Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, Downton Abbey, and for comedies I enjoy Psych, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Parks and Recreation, 30 Rock.  I'm not usually into shows that look like this (silly chick flick television dramas), unless something about them really draws my attention.  In this case, it was critics high praise of the first season.  Unusually high praise, and very high ratings.

So, I watched it, expecting the very worst - and was actually very pleasantly surprised.  It reminds me a lot of a parody of a soap opera with many caricature characters (the rich housewife sleeping with the hot young gardner, the crazy uptight conservative plastic perfect trophy wife), yet were able to add dimensions to them that actually made them more than caricatures; but actually likable, interesting people that could draw viewer empathy.

It also has a definite dark, mean streak in it, so the first season definitely fits into the well-done black comedy category.  It's a little morbid and I think it really is satire to a degree.

The stories of all the main characters are pretty interesting this season.  We have Gabrielle, the rich housewife, having an affair with her 16 year old gardner.  Bree is having family problems because she no longer communicates well with her husband, who is sick of her almost robotic movements of a plastic housewife with no feelings.  Lynette is dealing with four children as a stay-at-home mom, yet longing to go back to work.  And Susan is desperately trying to earn the affections of the new guy on the block, Mike.

There is also the main mystery story line of the season, which is not bad, but I don't think is nearly as strong as the personal lives of the main characters.  The narrator is Mary Alice, who committed suicide for an unknown reason, and it appears that her husband and son may have something to do with it.  Characters uncover more and more of the truth as time goes on, finally revealing what really happened at the end of the season.  What made this story line a little weak to me was the fact that Paul and Zach seemed fairly one dimensional and boring, and most importantly - no one really seemed to give a damn about Mary Alice's suicide.  If she was truly one of the best friends of these four women, how come everything was back to normal and laughs a week later?

The only person who truly seems affected by her death is Susan at times, but even then - not so much.  Such a traumatic shock would surely completely tear these people apart, so I think maybe at least a six month instead of one week jump in time from her suicide would have been more appropriate.  I know it's part of the morbidity and all; people selfishly continuing to lead their pointless lives when their best friend just committed suicide.  But even then, it's a stretch.

The supporting characters are also fun, such as the creepy Mrs. Huber.  The story lines also interweave very nicely together, and while a lot of it is obviously very silly, it's nicely done in a satirical fashion and the characters still have depth to them, which makes it more than just some silly, stupid show.

One of my main issues with this show as a series is the fact that the women never really seemed to have much of a girl friend connection together, like the girls on Sex and the City did.  They act like BFF, but keep so many secrets from one another and their interactions are sort of of weird and sporadic, that it doesn't really feel right.

It also has a Twin Peaks feel to it.  The mystery, the drama, the who killed who; if you loved Twin Peaks you may actually like this, male or female.

Unfortunately, there is a MAJOR issue with being a parody of something.  There is a fine line between making fun of something and falling into exactly what you're making fun of when you run out of ideas.  That is exactly what happened to Desperate Housewives.  Well, there were two things.  1) lack of creativity/ideas and forcing super contrived story lines, something that wasn't very common in the first season and 2) Cherry had much less to do with the writing and season two, and when you give up your baby to the other writers to control, things like that happen.  Although he came back in the third season, a lot of the damage was permanently done, and it never truly recovered.

Great, interesting first season with unbelievable potential, and then....completely failed after that.  Well, at least this season is still worth watching and rewatching here and there.

If you like dark comedy/dramas that are Twin Peaks-esque, check this out.  Don't expect the same quality after this season, however.",1353110400,2,4719,4.642168674698795

2205896,5,B00079FUI6,"After seeing the Desperate Housewives commercials, back in 2005 on the canadian channel Radio-Canada, I was very intrigued by Marc Cherry's show, which was supposed to be claimed very controversial in the United States. And after watching its pilot, I was, for the first time, seeing an incredible and unique dramedy. A universe where Mary Alice Young, a wonderful housewife married to an excellent husband and raising a charming son, kills herself in less than a few hours. And as the season unfolds, we discover the lives of her four best friends, all living in the same street, who try to figure out the mystery of the suicide of their best friend.

Now the first thing that really amazed me is how Mary Alice, instead of just being a narrator who tells us what is happening on the screen, is a real character. She comments what she sees and manages to pinpoint to us several things that occur during the episode. not only that, her narration is well integrated in the editing and the story of each episodes. and personnaly, I think her character is one of the main reasons why Desperate Housewives is fun and very exciting to watch.

As for the other characters, it was amazing to see how these characters interacted between each other, even though their perosnalities were completely different. While Gabrielle is superficial and vain, Bree is a perfectionist and Lynette is a control-freak. As for Susan, she's a very desperate romantic who almost worships her gorgeous plumber, Mike Delfino. And even though the viewer's ideals can be in conflict with certain characters, the writers manage to give to their characters believable emotions and reactions. And so we get some empathy for all these characters, with the way they interact with their family, and even when they argue or do some horrible things to each other. Once again, it is as if we are witnessing real characters interacting with each other. And witness several incidents that could, or did, happen in our lives, whether at school or on our own street. With excellent guest characters like Maisy Gibbons, whom I would love to see again in the future, Helen Rowlands and Carlos Solis.

As for the directing, I just loved the frenzy and the sweet madness that the director of the pilot, Charles McDougall , managed to put. As the music as well by Steve Bartek, for the first two episodes. They were both important reasons as to why people just adored Desperate Housewives and it is sad really theat they couldn't collaborate on more episodes than that. Fortunately , we got Steve Jablonsky for the music and Larry Shaw as a director. Two great additions to the series. Including Danny Elfman's excellent main theme.

Thanks to all these ingredients, we finally get a dramedy that stands out of the ordinary for its humour, its incredible and mysterious atmosphere and especially for the incredible, but believable, incidents that can, and sometimes do, happen in suburbia.",1269993600,,2942,4.878

2205901,5,B00079FUI6,"I started watching this with misgivings.  I thought it was going to be another pointless melodrama, or not unlike dozens of comedy shows that I've seen part of and dismissed as nonsense.  There is no laugh track so that dim bulbs will know what's supposed to be funny.  It did take a few episodes, I will admit, but I was eventually hooked.

The main women have impossible problems in an idyllic appearing neighborhood of a city that is never named.  Car license plates bear the name of a state that doesn't exist.  The picket fences are perfectly white.  The lawns are immaculately trimmed, without a dandelion, but it never rains or even gets cloudy.  And into this seemingly perfect world comes a ton of trouble.  First a suicide.  Then a mysterious handsome stranger who sets at least two female hearts aflutter.  A house gets torched around a measuring cup.  There are wild brats from hell.  A high school boy finds himself wooed and bedded by an unbelievably sexy woman.  There's a murder and a remote burial in the night.  And all of that is just for starters.

It sounds really bad when described that way, but it is all larded with satire and farcical scenes.  Much of it revolves around skewed value systems of the characters.  They value painfully green lawns.  Fancy cars.  Perfect dinner parties.  And they are constantly flopping on their faces, despite all their efforts.

The characters are varied--a much too perfect housewife, a horny divorcee, a blond seductress, a harried mother, and that very sexy statutory rapist.  The plot is convoluted, all tied somehow to the woman who commits suicide as the first episode opened.  Try as they might, her female friends cannot figure out why.

I did laugh a bunch, and I did look forward to the next episode.  But this is not for viewers who insist on stark reality and taking this show at face value.  Farce is not, after all, reality, just part of reality.",1255910400,4,1919,4.701807228915663

2205915,5,B00079FUI6,"When Desperate Housewives first aired in 2004 it broke all records for written comedy in years. Viewer tuned in to see this complex yet soapy view of everyday suburbia. And really, the appeal in Desperate Housewives is the fact that you know that behind every colorful facade and plastered smile lies a secret, sometimes little and juicy, other times tragic and dangerous.

There is something in the setting of this show. Everything is colorful, perfect and dreamy. But things in the lives of Susan, Bree, Lynette and Gabrielle start to unravel when the, seemingly perfect life of their friend Mary Alice Young ends tragically. After her suicide all that is left are dark secrets. The facade of perfect suburbia starts to crumble.

Clues are: a mysterious baby blanket of a child never seen before, a disturbed son who starts to remember shocking details from his past, a dangerous husband ready to do everything to cover up a dark secret, a spy on Wisteria Lane, a tape from Mary Alice's therapist, a threatening note and so much more.

Each episode gives hints and clues to the main mystery that spreads throughout the season and ends in a shocking cliffhanger filled finale. But the mystery is a backdrop to the real appeal of the series: the lives of our Desperate Housewives. Each one desperate to lead a perfect life and devastated when she realizes that it cannot be achieved. From the picture perfect Bree whose marriage starts to fall down, Lynette with her never ending job of being a perfect mom to her 4 children, Gabrielle who has everything yet feels a hole in her life to Susan who struggles to find love.

Each episode moves at high speed, so much is going on. It never gets boring. This is the perfect guilty pleasure and so much more. Marc Cherry, the creator, has planned every plot line from the beginning and it really shows. Everything is perfectly plotted and comes nicely together in the end. The comedy walks a fine line between dark humor and slapstick (Susan especially) with some great Zingers.

Buena Vista Home Entertainment has put together a great 6-Disc Set. All 23 Episodes of the 1st Season are presented in a crisp clear 16:9 widescreen transfer. The colors really pop out from the screen and add a lot to the overall tone of the show.

Extras include:
- Audiocomentaries from the Housewives on selected Scenes (which can be viewed as a half hour featurette)
- Audiocomentaries are provided for 5 Episodes including the pilot and the finale. They are all interesting. Creator Marc Cherry provides great insight into the show.
- Behind the Scenes of Desperate Housewives - a 25 minute Featurette about the creation of the show and the first season
- 3 Featurettes on the Costumes and Art Design (10 min.), DH Phenomenon around the world (10 min), Production Secrets (11 min.)
- Oprah Winfrey visits Wisteria Lane (8 min.)
- Outtakes
- Deleted Scenes (with optional commentary by Marc Cherry)
- Easter Egg (on Disc 4 i think)

Some of the Episodes are Extended and run about 45 min in length (as opposed to the usual 42 min.) adding bits and pieces to the storylines. These extended episodes include intros by Marc Cherry.

As you can see there is much to see and experiance in the first Season of Desperate Housewives. It's TV gone very right and a pleasure for everybody. I highly recommend it.

This show is different than most, at least to me. I thought it was going to be more of a ""Soap Opera"" type but it's more of a drama with comic undertones.

2205919,5,B00079FUI6,"Having only caught the odd episode of Desperate Housewives when it aired on Channel 4, I remember enjoying it and decided to buy the first series on DVD - and its even better then I remembered.

The four desperate housewives are the main protagonists in the series. Bree, who on the outside seems to be the perfect housewife with the perfect family, while actually her marriage is in trouble and her kids are rebelling against her. Gabby, the ex-model who married for money, not for love and has to resort to sleeping with her 17 year old gardener to find happiness. Susan, a single mother who gets along very well with her daughter but is constantly plagued by troubles with men as she tries to find love. And Lynette, the only happily married housewife, who has to deal with 4 troublesome sons.

Right from the very first scene of the first episode, the mystery and drama starts and it doesnt stop untill the end. I found the series very compulsive viewing and often ended up watching 3 or 4 episodes in a row because I just HAD 2 find out what happened next.

The show has mystery (a lot of it), drama, romance and is very funny in places, too.

""Desperate Housewives"" is a fun, sassy, innovative TV phenomenon that mixtures drama, comedy and mystery to create what is perhaps the best TV show of the last decade. It is already regarded as pioneering a new genre and will probably go down in history as one of the most popular shows of our time. In case you've been living under a rock for the past 3 years: the show revolves around 5 seemingly normal housewives who one day learn that one of their friends took her own life following a mysterious secret that haunted her and that we would only learn of at the end of the season. Every housewife goes through her own turmoil (Hatcher falls for a sexy plumber; Cross struggles marital problems and the discovery that her son is gay; Huffman gives up her business career to be a full-time doting mommy to a bunch of hyperactive children; adulterous Longoria sleeps with her gardener and almost loses her home; and Sheridan as the supporting act is always there to make quip remarks). You'll find yourself laughing quite often, thanks to the witty script and the talent of these 4 veteran TV stars (excluding Longoria). Highly recommanded.",1180483200,2,1176,4.713592233009709

2205976,5,B00079FUI6,"When I first heard that a series about housewives was being put together, I couldn't help but laugh. When the show was named ""Desperate Housewives,"" I was in disbelief, to say the least. And when everybody started praising it and calling it the finest show on TV, I thought the entire TV population should take a holiday to a deserted island, where there's no cable. Boy, was I wrong - not only is this show the best and most original project on TV, it was also funny, touching and, above all else, incredibly smart.

""Desperate Housewives"" invites the audience to the seemingly glamorous lives of women of suburbia and their families. The squeaky-clean surface of the upper-middle class seems heavenly, but that is only its surface. Through our beautiful, perfectly cast leading ladies, we are about to see what life can bring even to the most privileged ones. Susan Mayer (played by Teri Hatcher) is a single mother desperately trying to find the right man. Lynette Scavo (the brilliant Felicity Huffman) is a mother of four, desperately trying to handle her syper children. Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) is a spoiled ex-model who is desperately trying to keep her affair with her teenage gardener a secret from her husband. And finally, there is Bree Van De Kamp (played by the superb Marcia Cross), a perfectionist of a housewife, desperately keeping her house and relationship with her loved ones sterile-clean, in order to escape the obvious problems. Add a bunch of oblivious husbands, one attractive plumber (James Denton), one creepy family with a dark secret and at least one lady of loose morals (Edie Britt, played by Nicollette Sheridan), and you've got yourself a hot TV show.

The reason this show works so well is that all elements were obviously thought out carefully and put together without a problem. The actors are all excellent, and they impersonate their roles so well, you never feel they might actually have a life in the real world, as somebody's wives or girlfriends. Although the focus of the show is primarily on Hatcher, she is outshined by Cross and Huffman. Cross brings fantastic, complex performances to bring the complex character of Bree to life, she is the real star of the show. Huffman, on the other hand, approaches her under-written and un-glamorous role with wit and reality, making Lynette a character that is always closest to our hearts because she is the most humane one. Hatcher and Huffman have their moments (the infamous scene where Susan locks herself out of her house in her birthday suit, or the even more popular car-washing by Edie), but they mostly provide comic relief. Finally, Longoria seems to be on the show mostly for her looks (she was appropriately titled the most beautiful woman on television), but it's not until the second half of season one that she gets to show off her talents, as her character gets more dimension.

You simply cannot go wrong with buying this six-disk set. The residents of suburbia will keep you amused whether it's because of mistery, deceit, control, love or hate. Don't simply expect entertainment - expect an experience that will stick with you long after you're done with an episode. ""Desperate Housewives"" are not at all silly - it is a marvelous insight into human nature and the values of modern-day America.

Anyway, I caught a little of a rerun on the Lifetime network and was instantly hooked. So, I quickly rented the 1st two seasons on DVD so that I could be all caught up to join the season now in progress. It manages to be funny, even though the subject matter is often dark. And even the selfish/bad characters manage to be somewhat endearing. My favorite character has to be Lynette, trying to deal with all those kids (all those boys, especially).

Of course I thought the show was basically soft-core porn.  Every time I saw a promotion for it on TV, that was the only subject they discussed.  My brother finally told me after the first season was over ""It's not even mostly about sex!  There are all these murders and mysteries and it's also really funny.""  So I said to him I would watch his DVD set one day when I was bored and had seen everything else.  I tried SO hard to still dislike it (because I don't like admitting I am wrong) but I fell in love in the first episode.  You couldn't ask for more in a show.

2205998,5,B00079FUI6,"Desperate Housewives arrived on ABC back in 2004 and became a phenomenon. I had heard of the show, but never watched it and yet no matter where I went I heard people raving about it. Being a guy, it looked like an extended chick flick to me but I thought ""what the hell?"" and decided to rent it and see what everyone was talking about. Besides, I thought Eva Longoria was hot so at least I'd catch a few hours of her. After watching the first disc, it struck me how good this show was. It had four great and funny actresses; The show itself was witty and smart, but it wasn't an ""extended chick flick."" It actually has a pretty dark streak to it. The pilot episode opens with a suburbia housewife named Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) narrating about how normal her life is. Then, suddenly, she puts a gun to her head and kills herself. This sets up the rest of the show. After Mary Alice's sudden suicide, her four friends begin to wonder what happened while also dealing with other things going on in their lives. The friends are Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Bree (Marcia Cross), and Gabrielle (Eva Longoria). Out of the four housewives, Susan is kind of the odd-woman out. She's divorced and raising a teenage daughter, she's a bit clumsy and she's fallen for the new neighbor across the street. A plumber named Mike. Lynette is a stay at home mom, who used to work at successful firm but gave it all up to raise three boy-devils and a baby daughter. Bree seems to be the definition of perfection in suburbia. She lives with her husband Rex and her two kids, cooks lovely dinners each night. But the facade shatters when Rex tells her he wants a divorce. Then there's Gabrielle, a gold-digger of sorts who's married to Carlos. Carlos gives her everything she wants, supplies her with money and a house, but Gabrielle still chances cheating on him with their teenage gardener John (Jesse Metcalfe). The show is narrated by Mary Alice, who also appears to have some skeletons in her closet. That's all I say and now I'll list all the episodes and some comments on a few of them. This is a good show and I highly recommend it.

1. Pilot-This is a great pilot episode. It's simultaneously funny, slightly sinister, and opens a lot of doors for the following episodes.

2. Ah, But Underneath-This episode is hysterical. The part where Lynette leaves her kids behind is priceless.

3. Pretty Little Picture-Some of the one liners in this episode are hysterical. As are the events involving a nude Susan and a little-to-open Bree.

4. Who's That Woman-This is also very funny. The part where Carlos beats up a gay cableguy is classic.

5. Come In, Stranger-This episode has it's funny moments and it's disturbing moments. Gabrielle's mother-in-law is hilarious.

6. Running to Stand Still-I liked this episode a lot. Felicity Huffman's character Lynette is probably the highlight of this episode and of course Bree's explanation of her sex life was damn funny.

7. Anything You Can Do-This is one of my favorite episodes of the bunch. Some great (and very funny) stuff happens in this episode.

8. Guilty-Great ending.

9. Suspicious Minds-Another funny-as-hell episode. Susan getting slapped, Gabrielle making a revelation, the body, the end of the episode. Menacing and hilarious.

10. Come Back to Me-This episode has its moments. Bree's speech to her husband at the end was great.

11. Move On-Roger Bart (the scene-stealer from ""The Stepford Wives"") makes his first appearance as Bree's date.

12. Every Day A Little Death-The ""sick child"" and Carlos wanting to have a baby stuff were the highlights. Roger Bart shooting himself in the foot was great too.

13. Your Fault-A lot of revelations from Lynette's husband, Mary Alice's husband, and George (Roger Bart). Ryan O' Neal guest stars as Lynette's father-in-law.

14. Love is in the Air-Lynette's boys commit some felonies, Mike gets shot...There's a mysterious lack of George. Good episode though.

15. Impossible-This episode is a little more dramatic, rather than funny. What was funny, besides some other stuff, was a little revelation about Bree's son.

16. The Ladies Who Lunch-Once again, Lynette steals most of it...But Gabrielle & Carlos' sewage backup problem, among other things, are hilarious as well.

17. There Won't Be Trumpets-I didn't like how they (seemingly temporarily) remove Bree's son from the show without elaborating on the revelation in ""Impossible."" Other than that, this is a great episode.

18. Children Will Listen-This is one of my favorite episodes; A lot of twists and a lot of humor.

19. Live Alone and Like It-I don't have much to say about this episode. It's good, but not my favorite.

20. Fear No More-A whole bunch of twists are here. Gabrielle revealing the ""pregnant thing"" to Carlos was really funny.

21. Sunday in the Park With George-Great.

22. Goodbye for Now-Carlos beating up another gay guy was funny as hell. This episode is, obviously, trying to quickly set up stuff for season 2, but it works.

23. One Wonderful Day-The season finale ties up a lot of loose ends and also turns out to be one of the best episodes.

Face it.. weather you like it or not its purpose is meant for entertainment value. The fact that it's won awards is just a bonus. I just got the second season on dvd and before I began watching it I decided I wanted to watch the last episode of season 1 again first.. I've watched the full course of season 1 twice already on dvd and once when it originally aired on ABC. I remember the weeks going by slow while waiting to find out what madness would take place on Wisteria Lane next. The show is full of rich humor that is sometimes dark. It's mystery has you begging for answers no matter how off the wall the situation might be. The force of sexual nature is present in every episode.. the women and men are mostly beautiful but, lets face it, it works that way! I mean who would care to have a visual of say Rosie O'Donnel falling naked in a bush? Right we'd much rather see Teri Hatcher in that situation! And I think we'd all rather see Nicolette Sheridan squeeze a soapy sponge between her cleavage while washing her sports car than say Whoopi Goldberg. As for the female fans ..im sure they didn't mind Jesse Metcalf mowing Eva Longoria's lawn shirtless over someone like Frankie Muniz (God love Malcolm in the Middle). My point is if you are among those that question why the cast is majority attractive. Remember this is a television show thats sole purpose is to entertain its veiwers. Honestly I'd rather watch gorgeous people for an hour over a bunch of plain Jane's and average Joe's. Some veiwers also question why so many bad things can happen in one neighborhood.. the answer again is simple. DH is for entertainment ..which it provides with benefits!!

Great acting, beautiful women, amazing stories with cliffhanger endings that make you mad when the show ends leaving you in complete suspense, but can't help but love at the same time.

In my opinion, this is one of the best shows on TV right now and here is your chance to pick up the first amazing season and see what the fuss is all about.

2206024,3,B00079FUI6,"I tried to avoid Desperate Housewives for a long time. The more the Oprah crowd talked about it around the water cooler, the more I wanted to avoid it. Then I heard one of my heroes was going to be on the show. Yes Shaft himself was going to show up on Wisteria Lane, and since Shaft is one bad... (maybe I should shut my mouth), I had to check it out. What I found was a disturbingly entertaining show. First you have Lois Lane turned single bubbling single mom. The producer of Sports Night turned overwhelmed mom. The creepy chick who used to live at Melrose Place is now a Stepford wife. And of course, what show today isn't complete without a token hot chick. I wonder if the executives at ABC during pilot season go, ""yeah that a interesting show, but do you think you can add a token hot chick?"" Now if the other channels would only do this.

So it turns out that dead chick's husband has hired Shaft to find out who was blackmailing his wife. (Ironically the last lime I saw the dead wife was on Everwood where she played... the dead wife. Typecasting anyone?) This got me a little interested, not quite as interesting as the token hot chick, but anyways. But that is just one of many mysteries on Wisteria Lane. Unlike Lost, some of the mysteries were solved by the finally. Some with better results than others. It was interesting how they intertwined the two biggest questions together with why did the one chick commit suicide and who exactly is the plumber dude.

Then there were the mysteries that went unanswered, first and for most, what was the gay homosexual, also imported from Melrose Place, big secret that he talked about with his dad. The easiest answer of that he had another family was shot as he quit his job where he does a lot of traveling. My only other guess is that he swings both ways or they will drop that plot line all together. My other big problem was the introduction of the black family. Why did they show up only to accomplish nothing to the storyline? Either hold them off until next year or tease us with something that will have us guessing all summer. Watching them just move in was boring.

The biggest glaring problem I had with the show was with Paul Young. At first he concocts a great plan to hide the dead chick that his wife killed under the pool. But once his wife kills herself, he decides to move the body from a place where no one will find her and instead throws the bode and the and the wood box that it is in into a lake. Has he never seen ""Will it Float?"" on Letterman? Both wood and bodies float.

Looking forward to next season, I think it's pretty safe to say it will turn out that Dana is the plumber's kid (or at least the plumber will think so). The black family will have some deep dark secret. Susan will fumble around a lot. The Melrose Place dude will have the same problem his wife did as Mr. Mom. Edie will hit on the black dude. And hopefully if the token hot chick starts showing her pregnancy, they bring in another token hot chick to replace her.",1147478400,2,3021,4.322751322751323
2206025,5,B00079FUI6,"Desperate Housewives - The complete First Season is delightfully wicked. Creator Marc Cherry (The Golden Girls) is a genius, what a fabulous show he has created. When i first saw the previews to the show, I have to admit I was less than amused, I thought it was just some silly little soap barbara with nothing to it. Boy was I wrong, I decided to give this ""watercooler"" show a chance and I was hooked from the first episode. I love the second season just as much. Marcia Cross's brilliant character Bree Van De Kamp is a hoot. Bree is so complex and desperate to be the perfect wife and mother but she fails miserably of course. Felicity Huffman is outstanding as well as Lynn. Great cast even though I am not a big fan of Teri Hatcher, otherwise than that, Desperate Housewives will have you begging for more. Such a guilty pleasure, I love it!",1146528000,3,847,4.435897435897436
2206026,5,B00079FUI6,"""Desperate Housewives"" is a great show- it draws you as a watcher into the events, and you'll probably end up having strong opinions about the various ladies and their men.  By the time I finished the first season there were some that I hated, and others that I liked a great deal.  The narration of the show is done by a deceased woman named Alice Young, which is by itself a unique concept, and revolves loosely around how and why she killed herself.  Throughout the season the sordid undercurrents of Wisteria Lane (aka Suburbia USA) are explored in an entertaining and usually humorous fashion.  All of the Actors/Actresses do a fine job.

I was hesitant to event give the show a chance, being a man; but my brother gave it a good recommendation, and I figured my wife and I could watch it and have some fun.  We did & we can't wait for season 2.",1145750400,2,850,4.416666666666667
2206027,3,B00079FUI6,"In front of everyone reading this review, I must admit, I closeted my desire to watch this program.  Not being a huge television watcher I had not seen but just the first episode of this series, but knew that I could not get into it without starting it from beginning to end.  I would not understand, connect, or feel emotion for the characters unless I developed myself with them.  So, with all the strength I could muster, I waited.  Patiently, I waited and rented the full first season of Desperate Housewives.  I was ready to come out and see what these visually perfect women had to offer the world of television and the image of the suburban housewife.  Sadly, I was not blown away as greatly as I initially imagined.  Marc Cherry has done his Twin Peaks-esque homework, but just like Lost, there are episodes that just felt too cheap for your typical TV standards, yet there is something so darn exciting about these women that you cannot help but watch from the beginning to end.  Creator Marc Cherry has done it.  He has successfully created a drug that tastes horrible, but is instantly addictive.

For any of you that have chosen to change the channel when these five women of Wisteria Lane have appeared, let me be brief.  Five women (actually four, but whose counting) snoop, steal, fascinate, corrupt, snivel, secret, and fanaticize over each other while never having to worry about money, security, or any form of structured day-to-day schedule.  In fact, I think that half of the appeal of this show is seeing these women run around mid-day attempting to uncover a secret that isn't theirs without any worry about jail, job, or income.  My, isn't this the life we have all desired?  What pulls any viewer into this show is the backstory that uncovers with each of these women.  Again, like a pastel colored Twin Peaks we see how each of these stories can either stand on their own or intertwine with one another creating a very sinister neighborhood that would make Fred Rogers blush.

I am an enormous fan of sequential television.  I enjoy watching a program that involves me needing to see prior episodes to fully understand what is happening.  I think that change to modern television was definitely needed to keep audiences returning night after night.  I applaud Desperate Housewives for doing this, but after nearly 23 episodes, some characters, events, and plot lines just started to feel extremely tired and longwinded.  For example, I loved the opening episode.  There was so much energy, so much spunk, so much excitement, but as it went deeper into episode 13, these four women began to annoy men.  It was as if none of them decided to use logic or reason at all.  It seemed, and felt, as if the police were never an option, while it would have added more suspense to the final moments.

As this series developed, there were some good moments, but overall I was getting bored.  Teri Hatcher was the most annoying of these ladies.  She reminded me of a Gremlin, and continued to wait to see what would happen if she got wet or was fed after midnight.  Marcia Cross's storyline was decent to watch, but got old after some time.  You just wanted to call the police and tell them what was happening, because nobody else was going to.  Eva Longoria's moments were getting repetitive and her story seemed the flimsiest.  Did anyone else notice that Nicollette Sheridan was missing for several episodes than would return to really add nothing new to the mix?  As much as she was publicized for this series, you would think that we would see her more?  Finally, I would like to add that the only woman that captivated me the entire time she was on screen was Felicity Huffman.  Her story worked because it seemed the most ""real"" and symbiotic.  She was the only one that was worth relating to throughout the series.  Two other points, first, I think I am going to like Alfre Woodard's character and James Denton should have been played by Nathan Fillion of Firefly fame.  He would have brought the passion I was so desperately lacking with Delfino's character!

Overall, I think Marc Cherry has created an interesting series that opens a darkened door to the unknown/perfect world known as suburbia.  Has he perfected it?  Not with this opening series.  For Cherry to keep his core audience with Desperate Housewives he will need to improve upon the characters, strengthen the storyline, and develop more interesting twists than what was initially shown.  He needs to let Teri Hatcher go, and develop these other women's stories that obviously have taken at least one day of acting lessons.  Cherry needs to shorten the stories as well.  While I agree 23 episodes is worth your money, I don't think I could have watched 23 weeks of this and still been interested.  It was good to watch this all in one week thanks to the DVDs, but if it weren't for them I believe Cherry would have lost me as a viewer.  I needed more, and sadly was handed naive characters that can get away with anything because they are more centered around themselves than anyone else.  Is this an accurate picture of America's suburbia?  Maybe, but for me to be sold on Cherry's ideas, I need him to tighten down and give me a side order of Lynch instead of Friends.

Alot of guys are put off simply by the title ""Desperate Houswives"" they immediately assume that it is geared for a female audience.

2206063,5,B00079FUI6,"I purposely avoid shows when they are hot and the whole world is watching.  Not too long ago I picked this up, just to see what all the hype was about.  After the first episode I locked myself in the house and refused to come out until I had watched the entire first season.  Ha ha ha ...

The series opens with the suicide of one of the wives on Wisteria Lane, Mary Alice.  While the entire neighborhood reels from her death, her four friends, Susan, Lynette, Brie and Gabrielle, are left without their fifth (unless you count the man eater, Nicolette Sheridan, who they are all bitterly jealous of but aren't saying a word about).  Mary Alice, while only appearing in the first and final episodes, never leaves them and looks down upon her friends and the audience with obvious love.  She does, however, wish that she was able to tell them the truth about her suicide, and that they will all realize the truth about all the dity little secrets on their otherwise ordinary suburban existence.

Each of the four friends represents a part of us all: trying to juggle a thousand things at once, dealing with family problems, etc.  Susan, the most likalbe despite (or maybe because of) her bumbling antics, is trying to raise her daughter as a single mom, keep up with her career, and hide her embarassing crush on the plumber, Mike.  Lynette lives across the way, a former power lunch career woman who is now a stay at home mom to four of the most undisciplined children ever (well, three at least, the fourth is just a baby).  Brie is perhaps the most perfect, most well mannered, and most Martha Stewart of them all, but is hiding her dysfuntional family troubles under a thin veil of fresh baked goods and interior design.  Last of all is Gabrielle, the trophy wife who is given everything on a silver platter by her adoring husband, but is carrying on a secret affair with the teenage gardener.

How well do we really know our neighbors?  How well do you really know your friends?  And would you really want to?  After seeing a show like this, where you as the audience are exposed to all that goes on behind every closed door, you realize that still waters run deep.  We all have dirty little secrets, tell little white lies, and are not who we may appear to be to others.  Are we truly better people for hiding things or do we really want others to know what goes on in our houses?  That's a question for the ages.  It seems that everyone in the circle of friends as well as the secondary characters (kids, friends of the kids, new neighbors, etc.) is trying to keep up appearences.  We're all happy.  We're all holding it together.  When under the surface, we really aren't.

What makes this a great show is not just the hilarious moments and the exposure of these dirty secrets (see the scene where Brie's husband is cheating with the neighbor lady whose side business is prostitution), but the underline horror story that keeps building.  Mary Alice had some terrible secret from the past.  Susan accidentally set a house on fire.  Lynette is frazzled and popping pills.  Gabrielle is having an affair but her husband is closing in on her.  And Brie, poor, harassed Brie, has a rake of a husband who could care less about her, and a son who is so sociopathic, so evil, so void of remorse, that she has no idea how bad it will get until it's too late.  The tensions build and keep us in suspense until the very end.  This is a true gem in television history.",1142294400,5,3464,4.476874003189793
2206064,5,B00079FUI6,"I have to admit that at first I didn't jump on the ""Desperate Housewives"" bandwagon like most people did when the show first premiered on ABC in the fall of 2004. Then I caught the pilot episode when it aired as a rerun. Afterwards, I could see what all the fuss was about. I really enjoyed the first episode of this show, but about ten episodes had already aired by the time I saw the pilot, and this is the kind of show that you need to watch from the first episode to the last episode in the order that they air. So therefore I had to wait until the show made its debut on DVD, and then I was able to watch every episode from beginning to end.

""Desperate Housewives"" is a sometimes funny, sometimes serious show that deals with sex, murder, blackmail, and plenty of dirty laundry. The show takes place on Wisteria Lane, and centers mostly around five totally different women: Susan Mayer, Lynette Scavo, Bree Van De Kamp, Gabrielle Solis, and Edie Britt. These five characters are brought wonderfully to life by Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, and Nicollette Sheridan. While these five women are the anchor of ""Desperate Housewives"", they are surrounded by alot of memorable supporting characters. The action on Wisteria Lane begins with the suicide of Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong, who does an excellent narrating job), who was close friends with Susan, Lynette, Bree, and Gabrielle. While ""Desperate Housewives"" is part comedy and part drama, it also contains some mystery that's thrown in for good measure. The main mystery of the first season of ""Desperate Housewives"" is that these ladies try to figure out why their dear friend decided to kill herself. In the middle of all this you get plenty of lust, intrigue, and messy situations that all play out in terrific fashion. Besides the big mystery storyline, some of the other memorable major storylines in season one include: Susan's relationship with new neighbor Mike (James Denton); Gabrielle's affair with her 17-year-old gardener John (Jesse Metcalfe) that she desperately tries to keep a secret from her husband Carlos (Ricardo Antonio Chavira); Lynette's adventures as a stay-at-home mom in which most of the time she has to deal with her kids more than her husband Tom (Doug Savant); and Bree driving her husband Rex (Steven Culp) and two teenage kids Andrew and Danielle (Shawn Pyfrom and Joy Lauren) crazy with her constant perfectionist attitude.

The acting, writing, and directing of ""Desperate Housewives"" is all first rate. The show's creator is Marc Cherry, who started off as a writer of episodes of my personal favorite show ""The Golden Girls"". That's interesting, because ""Desperate Housewives"" is probably the best television series since ""The Golden Girls"" to feature an entire female cast in the leading roles. All of their hard work has earned the cast and crew plenty of awards. ""Desperate Housewives"" won 2 Golden Globes for its first season: Best Comedy Series, and Best Actress in a Comedy Series for Teri Hatcher. It followed that with 2 Screen Actors Guild awards, with Hatcher winning again for Best Actress in a Comedy Series, and Best Ensemble Cast of a Comedy Series. At the Emmy awards, ""Desperate Housewives"" got stumped a little. In spite of 15 Emmy nominations, it failed to win Best Comedy Series. But in a surprise twist in the Best Actress in a Comedy Series category, Felicity Huffman took home the Emmy in this category, beating out co-stars Hatcher and Cross (Hatcher was the heavy favorite to win).

After watching all these episodes of the first season of ""Desperate Housewives"", I'm now a big fan of the show. And I've watched every episode of season two so far. And yes, I'll get the second season of ""Desperate Housewives"" when it comes out on DVD.

The show is amusing, dark, and hooks you from the first, with the mystery of why one of the ladies killed herself, when her life appeared perfect.

The show is generic, generic, generic.  Overblown supermarket aisle publication crap.  The messages could not be more recyclable nor superficial.  Some people have compared this show to Sex and the City (which is not precisely a shrine of depth in itself) and it's unfair to do that because it lacks all of that show's acidic wit and insider humor.

2206085,5,B00079FUI6,"Desperate Housewives was a huge hit and rightly so. It is the story of several housewives living in Wisteria Lane, an expensive American suburban street. The main characters are Susan, Lynette, Gabrielle and Bree.

Susan (Teri Hatcher) is the ditsy divorced mother with one daughter and a fancy for her hunky new neighbour. Lynette was a high flying career woman but is now tied to the home and her unruly brood of 4 children. She could cope with anything at work but has problems coping with domesticity. Gabrielle is the Latin beauty, married to Carlos who is rich enough to provide everything she could want. However it's not enough and she is having an affair with her very young gardener. Bree is perfection personified, immaculately turned out and with a house like something from ideal homes. However her husband and children cannot live up to her ideals or live with this perfection. The narrator of the whole series is Mary Alice, a friend of all the women who, in the first episode, commits suicide. The central thread of the tale is why she was driven to this and what dark secrets are hidden in the lives of the characters.

Although there is a central theme, each episode does have a `stand alone' story for the occasional viewer, but to really enjoy it at its best the series should be watched in its entirety and from the beginning. Twists and turns, murder and mayhem, love and friendship are all to be found in a series that is by turn both wickedly funny and poignant.

Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  Desperate Housewives does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It's all about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

The setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!

In short, Desperate Housewives is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!",1136678400,5,1083,5.298245614035087

2206090,5,B00079FUI6,"I love the show, it simply shows the women out there what happens after you jump the fence of matrimony and family life. While in Sex and the City the girls were trying hard to find the Mr. Perfect to cure all their problems, here in DH they show that the other pastures are not always greener. I love the tagline: every family has its dirty laundry. It indeed has.

About the characters, Bree would be the most annoying and perfect housewife, but after a while you sympathize with her, she is really what she is, she is not out there to compete and make other women inadequate, she is just a perfectionist person. And though Gabrielle is a wretched and adulterous wife, it is hard to hate her, I found her to be quite cute in her schemes. But the one my heart sympathizes more is Lynette the burnout mother, though she needs to learn to spank her kids. She is the real portrait of the suburban mother that cannot rest a minute and is thinking about going back to work (I've been there, I know what is like). The only character that seems quite odd to me is Susan, she doesn't seem to have passed through real motherhood. Her daughter is more like girl friend, their relationship seems false or maybe her daughter never grew up at home, was shipped to some boarding school. The woman is pathetic, needs her daughter to advise about life and everything.

About the guys, the only husband that I found nice was Mr. Solis, he adores his wife though he is busy to keep company to her all the time, she needs to busy herself in a fulfilling work, not a lover, after all no husband or any man can fill all the hours of the day by your side, pampering you, whorshipping you, so get real.",1135728000,3,1680,4.33015873015873

2206092,5,B00079FUI6,"Now this is the true definition of intriguing drama, remarkable comedy, stimulating mystery and pure brilliance.

With many of the best television show exiting our screens, such as Friends, Sex And The City and Everybody Loves Raymond, the thought of TV started to look dull. Who would have thought that one of the most captivating shows to ever screen on our televisions could have been this amazing? It's stunning and impossible to fault! Everything from the casting to storylines are perfect.

Teri Hatcher is at her best in this, displaying not only her abilities as a dramatic actress but a comedian aswell. She plays Susan, the clumsy single mother, desperate for love and attention of the mysterious, new neighbour, Mike.

Marcia Cross splendidly plays the perfect Bree, who leads people to believe she lives the perfect life with the perfect family up until the revelation that her troubled husband wants a divorce.

Eva Longoria plays the shallow, self obsessed Gabrielle. Searching for meaning in her life, the materialistic Gabrielle finds satisfaction in having an affair with her seventeen year old gardener, John.

Felicity Huffman plays Lynette, the hectic mother of four whose husband is constantly busy at work. Endlessly running after her four children under the age of 6, Lynette tries her hardest to keep the spark in her marriage.

Finally, Nicollette Sheridan plays the serial divorcee Edit, always on the prowl for men, including Susans love interest, Mike.

These five women are incredible together as they unravel the mysterious suicide of the neighbour and best friend, Mary Alice Young (played by Brenda Strong) who narrates from the grave.

Marc Cherry has created, what can only be described as one of the most brilliant series to ever grace our screens. The writing is absorbing and constantly keeps you guessing what will happen next from the unusual opening scene to the astonishing final cliff hanger of the first season.

Overall, this DVD set is satisfying, engaging and packaged in this exquisite 6 disc box set. No disappiontment here.",1134691200,14,2072,5.1246290801186944

At times it is a bit too predictible, but being as it is the first season, you can't judge it too harshly. The X-files took 2 seasons before firing on all cylinders.

It was nice to get the complete first season and relive all the great moments from season one. The storylines were well written and very enjoyable. Starting with Mary Alice's suicide, it propelled a mystery that spanned the whole season and encompassed the whole cast. Teri Hatcher plays the unlucky in love heroine Susan, who has a daughter Julie from her previous marriage to Karl. Felicity Huffman plays Lynette, mother of four, who struggles with raising her kids. Eva Longoria plays Gabrielle, a rich socialite who is spoiled and married to her husband Carlos, but also having an affair with her gardener John. Marcia Cross plays Bree, the perfect housewife who has to deal with her rebelious son and cheating husband.

2206097,5,B00079FUI6,"I have to admit that this is one of the best shows that I've ever seen in my life. I really felt in love with the girls of ""SEX AND THE CITY"" and although lots of people compare ""DH"" with ""SATC"". I believe that they're very different. ""SATC"" was fun, crazy and with some touching moments but this one has mistery mixed with drama and comedy.

The story from this show, starts with the suicide of Mary Alice a woman who lives in a nice and quiet place called Wisteria Lane. This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things togetehr about her suicide but nothing matches. While they start getting information you have the change to know them very well...

Susan (Teri Hatcher) is divorced, has a teenage daughter and is the kind of woman that everything happends to her and is always between embarrassing moments. She lives kinda depressed until one day she meets a new neighbor who she happends to like very much. Then there's Lynette (Felicity Huffman), who has 3 little boys and a baby girl. She used to be a successful executive but after her marriage she became a housewive. Her kids drive her crazy and her husband is always travelling.

Bree (Marcia Cross) is an obsessed woman who likes to have everything perfect in her life and happeneds to be so cold with her husband sometimes that that got her to the edge of a divorce. Her two teenagers also have a bit acid reltionship with her. Finally there's Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) who seems to have the prefect life. She's married and her husband instead of giving her his full attention, he simply buys her whatever she wants. Diamonds, cars, etc. She feels empty and she has an affair with her gardener.

The husbands also happend to have desperated lifes also.

Many things happend during this first season. The production is very good, the cast is flawless and the episodes get better and better.

This package is loaded with lots of bonus features including deleted scenes, secrets of Wisteria Lane, Oprah Winfrey as a neighbor, behind the scenes and much more.

Touchstone is really breaking all the records with this successful series and ""LOST"" another series that I really recommend, it's different but very good also.",1132531200,11,2383,4.727710843373494

I didn't become very attached to any of the characters and although the show was often interesting and whacky, I didn't find it to be anything overly special, although there were a couple of episodes in the middle of the season which were very exciting.

I will probably watch the set one more time and then sell it.

Each episode is so well crafted and the dialog so witty, you can watch again and again and still find new stuff to enjoy. The mystery surrounding the neighborhood is only the beginning to this story as every housewife have their own comical lives to deal with. It's also not a cream-puff show as murders are shown with shocking clarity (Paul kills the meddling neighbor by smashing her head in!) and dark humor weaves itself in each episode.

The magnificent cast is perfectly tailored for each wife. From the ditzy Teri Hatcher to the wonderful Marcia Cross, each lady brings a certain something to the screen.

2206121,5,B00079FUI6,"I am a married man and first recorded Desperate Housewives (DH) on VHS to watch later on after our kids were asleep due to its airing in the middle of the prime time format (before their bedtimes) and this was definitely NOT appropriate material for their ages (all below teen) plus it aired here during ESPN NFL Sunday night football.  Being married with kids, I thought I might enjoy this and somewhat identify, but unfortunately fell behind after only a few episodes and mixed up all the tapes since I stupidly didn't chronologically label/date each 2-episode tape which I tried in vain to do later.  Well, to make a long story short, I decided to wait for the DVD set and rented it at Blockbuster, saving all the tapes for this season.  Watching it on DVD, I found it to be far better than on broadcast tv, eliminating all the commercials and weekly cliffhangers.  I rented out all the discs sequentially and watched all the bonus features on them, especially the extended episodes.  DH has become one of my all-time tv faves... so much so that I have bought this DVD box set.  I am now caught up to this season and am religiously watching the show each week, never to fall behind or miss another episode again.  DH is comfort food... the characters are rich with hidden secrets, pasts, flaws, weakenesses and admirable qualities.  Like the writing and production of the ABC show ""Lost"" (another of my faves), creator,/writer/director/producer Marc Cherry has totally fleshed out his characters and involved them in amazingly well-written plots full of twists, turns and jaw dropping surprises.

The four main housewives of Wisteria Lane in the ficticious city of Fairview are Lynette, Bree, Susan and Gabrielle.  Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria), aka Gabbie, is the self-centered, primadonna, former-supermodel Latina diva who is cheating on her rich, chauvinistic, alpha-male husband, Carlos Solis (Ricardo Chavira) with their gardner, John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe), a high school boy.  Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher, an Emmy nominee) is the recently-divorced, cute, clutsy, emotional single mom of a teen-aged daughter, Julie (Amanda Bowen), who falls almost immediately for the new neighbor, a mysterious handsome plumber named Mike Delfino (James Denton) who is also a ""scoring"" target of her neighbor rival voluptuous, vixen, platinum blonde, realtor, Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan), whom with Susan is seemingly always in constant competition.  The prim, propper, well-mannered, immaculatelely dressed and groomed Bree Van De Kamp (Marcia Cross, an Emmy nominee) is an ultra-conservative, Baptist, NRA member, Republican socialite wife of a doctor, Rex Van De Kamp (Steven Culp) who on the outside is the homemaker/housewife extraordainaire with two teenagers, Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom) and Danielle (Joy Lauren) who seemingly are perfect kids, but this IS Wisteria Lane after all.  Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman, who won the Emmy) is a former ad-executive who gave up her career after marriage to her fellow ad-exec. husband Tom Scavo (Doug Savant), so that she could properly raise her four children... twin 8 year old boy hellions plus their one year younger brother and infant daughter. This over-burdened wife and mom is the epitome of a desperate housewife - Lynette is probably the most identifiable character on the show and therefore clearly earns the most audience empathy.

Each episode opens with a nicely narrated recap/intro, wonderful Emmy-nominated title sequence and Emmy-winning theme by Danny Elfman and is wrapped up in poignant, narrative moralistic fashion.  The series' plot opens immediately with the apparent suicide of the four main housewives' neighboring wife group-hub and friend, Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) and is narrated (as well as acted) wonderfully throughout the entire series by her.  There are several clouds of mystery surrounding her suicide, including a mysterious blackmail-type of note.  This is pretty much the glue that holds all the subplots together, spawning several other subplots and introducing new characters as the series develops.  Whatever you do, do not watch this season or any of its coming attractions (change channels on commercial promos) until you have seen last season - you will miss way too much character and plot development.  DH clearly should have won the Emmy, but due to a major male voting portion of the academy's unfamiliarirty and the ""Raymond"" hype of closing the book on 9 successful seasons, it lost out to ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" the sentimental choice.  It was far better production-wise (with some amazing camerawork), scripting, editing, directing, costuming, casting as well as acting.  I expect DH to win the Emmy for Best Comedy Series this season if it is nearly as good as it was in its debut year- so far, so good.  Last season, it won for six of the astonishing fifteen Emmy nominations it received.  In summary, DH is a guilty pleasure that really leaves you feeling not too guilty about enjoying it on a regular basis.

2206138,5,B00079FUI6,"The women of Wisteria Lane drew enormous interest in the media since this adult rated TV show began airing on ABC. The story revolves around Martha Stewart-perfect Bree (Marcia Cross), who has it all, until she finds out her husband is cheating on her. Gaby (Eva Longoria) is a bored trophy wife whose addiction for shopping and clothes are the perfect decoy for her affair with the hunky teenage gardener (Jesse Metcalfe). Former career woman Lynette (Felicity Huffman) is the most stereotypical housewife raising four kids and frustrated, and Susan (Teri Hatcher), the divorcee looking for love sees her prospects brighten with the arrival of hunky plumber Mike (James Denton) who has some desperate secrets of his own.

It is a fast and wild mix of plot and characters that made this a hit show. There are 23 episodes on this DVD set, and six of the episodes can also be viewed in unrated extended versions. The DVD also includes five leading ladies' separate commentaries on few of their favorite scenes discussing the characters' clothes and homes, the show's appeal, casting decisions, the show's much-hyped secrets, and how naked Teri Hatcher had to be. There is also a segment in which talk show diva Oprah pays a visit to Wisteria Lane. If you are a fan of this soap opera your dreams are fulfilled; the DVD is out there for you to check it out.",1129075200,6,1354,4.761702127659574
2206139,4,B00079FUI6,"When I was a kid, every TV program started and ended in the alloted time-- 30 or 60 minutes and everything was all wrapped up-- so you could watch any episode of any show and not feel the need to be ""caught up.""  With serials, if you miss the boat up front you might decide not to watch the show at all-- or, you might hop on and feel like you've been left out of the secret club.

More and more, people are waiting for the DVD to enjoy a season of programming.  So here we have the opportunity to consider Desperate Housewives, season one, as a whole work.  There are some common misconceptions about the show.  First, that it is a drama, or ""nighttime soap.""  In fact, although the plots flow and tease from one episode into the next, the show is a comedy disguised as a drama.  (Note that Huffman, Cross, and Hatcher were nominated for the Best Actress in a comedy emmy category.)  And it is wickedly funny, more so because you get the feeling that not everyone watching is in on the joke.

Second, the early publicity painted this show as a sex romp-- four (or five) ""desparate"" housewives, living and loving on one cozy suburban street.  But no; in reality this is a murder mystery, one that reels you in from the very first hour. The sexual content was overhyped because one of the very first scenes of the first show depicts the Eve Longoria character having an affair with her teenage gardener.  But what made this show sizzle were the two predominant mysteries: why did Mary Alice kill herself, and what became of Deirdre, the woman Mike was searching for?  (And who was ""Dana""?)  These mysteries gave the show its addictive quality.  And the arc of the story over the season-- and the way the two plots eventually intertwine-- is a brilliant piece of writing, and an example of serial TV at its best.  Good serial TV works as a whole, singular piece of art; the body of episodes is better than any individual one.  Such is the case here; you have one meticulously thought out and crafted set of story and they unfold and bounce off each other and intersect with sheer perfection as the season races to its conclusion.

Mary Alice is the fifth housewife, and she narrates the episodes as an all-seeing presence; she kills herself at the very beginning of the first show, and spends the rest of the season wryly observing the foibles of her former friends and neighbors with a weary, knowing detachment. The show also works as a commentary on American suburbia, with everything too perfect and pastel, and the lawns too finely manicured; think Edward Scissorhands, with dark comedy replacing goth.

All SIX housewives (the big four, plus Mary Alice, plus Edie Britt, the local hot slut played by Nicole Sheridan) are distinctly drawn, and sexy and beautiful.  Longoria was the breakout star, probably because her character was sleeping with the gardener, but for my money he real hottie is clumsy Susan, played by the incandescent Teri Hatcher.

This show is way better than you probably expect if you haven't watched much of it.  At first you will feel like it is a guilty pleasure.  But as you begin to appreciate the quality of the writing, and the dark undercurrent (it is after all narrated by an all-American mom who has shot hersellf), you will lose the guilt and be left with pleasure.  This is American pop culure at its best and most knowingly campy, and if you want to participate in American pop culture you owe it to yourself to take the plunge.",1128902400,5,3466,4.572815533980583

2206152,4,B00079FUI6,"""Desperate Housewives"" Season 1 is a must for your TV on DVD collection. It's packed with extra features, the episodes are in a widescreen format, and the quality of the set is great. There are just minor flaws that hold it back from being a ""great"" DVD set.

One of my complaints is that the extra features is spread out on the six discs. Why? Yes, some of it makes sense, such as having the extended episodes on the discs that the original episode appeared on. Yet, some of the short documentaries and specials, to me, could have been easily moved and shifted to one disc and one more episode could have been added to each disc in order to make room for a simple special features disc.

The disc menu is a bit challenging. I had to click on various arrows on my remote to get around to the title and section that I wanted. The font used for most of the disc is ""cute"" and flowery, going along with the suburban housewife theme, but it can get right down hard to read against the background color and when it's everywhere on the screen. Having a long intro whenever you put a disc in was a bit annoying as well. It was fun to watch on the first disc, okay the second, but after a while, it got repetitive.

I liked the so called ""extended"" episodes and how Cherry would introduce them and let you know how the additional scenes made the episode different or added something more to the season 1 plots, but really. One scene added and it's suddenly an ""extended"" episode? Why not include the extended episode in with the regular set of episodes? I don't think anyone would have objected to watching an extended episode rather than the one that appeared on the network. The deleted scenes could have also been worked into the original episodes, for this is all the extended episodes are. Quick, 30 second scenes that are good, but don't exactly make the episode that different or worthy of being called out as ""extended.""

That being said, this DVD set has a lot to offer a new audience as well as a regular viewer. I'd recommend everyone listen to the audio commentary. Things that you may have missed or never picked up on will change how you view the show. Unlike some DVD releases where the commenary isn't all that informative, Cherry will tell you what he liked, what he didn't like, why this happened, what should have happened, flubs, everything. It's fun to listen to and great that he didn't hold back that much information.

I also enjoyed the ""Oprah is the new Housewife."" This isn't a regular Oprah show appearance/interview. This is actually a 20 or so minute mini episode where Oprah moves into Wisteria Lane as a former runner of a corporation in Chicago with her husband. Her character goes around and interacts with the housewives, stumbling upon some of season 1's great moments. The fashion commentary is another fun introduction to each housewife. I wasn't too thrilled with ""Housewives around the world"" and wasn't too impressed by each actress' commentary on their few favorite scenes. Another great featurette is the behind the scenes feature where you learn a little something about season 2 more so than the past season (this is also an introduction to Alfre Woodard's character).

There's a lot packed into this release that makes it worth the price tag. The quality of the show, both in writing and filming, comes through. If you go through all the features or at least half of them, you'll learn a lot about the show and the thought that goes into each character. With this, you'll also see why ""Desperate Housewives"" is perhaps this decade's ""Knots Landing,"" ""Dallas,"" or ""Dynasty."" This is one of the few shows that can make you laugh and then cry in the next scene. The actors (male and female) are great, even the guest stars. Don't doubt the quality of this show, buy it, watch it, and join the league of many ""desperate"" fans.",1128643200,5,3860,4.586956521739131

I find that as much as I love the episodes on TV, I enjoy them even more on DVD. The episodes flow well, are ten times more enrapturing without the commercials, and are of a high quality. The extras are fun, especially Bree's multicultural dinner party where you hear the characters talking in a variety of languages, and I love the extended episodes. It's interesting to see what you've missed with cut scenes, and the extra scenes add a whole new dimension and further your understanding of the sordid goings-on of Wisteria Lane. They've also done an excellent job of packaging the DVDs, and while there may be six of them they're easy to keep track of.

2206155,5,B00079FUI6,"Desperate Housewives, the current most hottest show on television, has its first DVD out- Season One. The success of this show is that it evokes America's guilty pleasures with evening soaps like it's 80's predecessor Dallas or for that matter Dynasty. The characters live lives we fantasize about, the drama is gripping, the cast is a hot bunch, and the sex scenes are sizzling. It is a guilty night-time pleasure right before we go to bed. Meet the women of Wisteria Lane- Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Nicollette Sheridan, and Teri Hatcher. Each woman has something to be desperate about. Bree (Marcia Cross) is a nearly-Stepford Wife-Martha Stewart wife whose only concern is keeping up appearances and keeping her reputation. It all falls apart when her husband cheats on her with a dominatrix, she becomes the gossip of the counry club, she arouses the romantic feelings of her local pharmacist and who is able to kill off her husband. Eva Longoria's character Gabrielle is filthy rich and married to a successful and wealthy lawyer, the Hispanic Carlos. But she is bored and indulges in an affair with a 17 yr old gardener (Jesse Metcalfe formerly of NBC's daytime soap Passions). Teri Hatcher's Susan is a girl who falls madly in love with the sexy but mysterious plumber Mike Delfino, who holds dark secrets from his past. It seems everyone has dirty laundry in Wisteria Lane. This DVD is packed with commentary from the actresses and from the Producer/Creator Marc Cherry. All of America will continue to love this show. Let's just hope they don't make the same mistakes as Dynasty and realize that this kind of series has to have a very solid resolution. The best part of this series is that for a soap opera it has modern twists- there is a ton of comedy in here and a touch of the supernatural. The narrator is the voice of the dead Mary Alice, who knows every little detail in the lives of the Desperate Housewives.",1128297600,2,1945,4.774480712166172

2206157,5,B00079FUI6,"I resisted Desperate Houswives because of all the hype, then finally gave it a chance and was impressed that the writers had taken what is essentially an over-the-top nighttime soap opera and turned it into a subversive, witty, character-driven plot that shows the tiger's claw that lurks beneath the velvet carpet of modern suburbia. Everyone is beautiful, affluent, hip, educated and yet for all their privilege the characters are ""desperate,"" scared, lost, full of secret demons, and compulsive. Their wills clash, and we see the resulting tumult, which is always surprising and has the right touch. One of the saving graces of this series is that it achieves a balance between showing the dark side of modern domesticity while never taking itself too seriously.

Fans of Desperate Housewives will appreciate the Showtime series ""Weeds,"" which deals with similar themes in a similar setting.",1128211200,2,894,5.251748251748252
2206158,1,B00079FUI6,"This is junk tv for the type of women who see the world through a lens of Cosmopolitan magazine and high-end mall consumer culture. While marketed as fresh and contemporary, the women in this series are actually a throwback to the ditzes of the old fifties tv sit-coms - with one glaring difference: the fifties women (Lucy, Gracie Allen, Eve Arden) were talented comediennes. The Desperate Housewives are talented at nothing but the ability to schedule more plastic surgery with their doctors. No one works, no one has any intellectual, cultural, political interests, everyone lives in a fantasy world suburbia where everyone is cosmetically perfect, etc. Think of this as the disaster that would happen if Oprah produced a ""comedy"" show - in other words, a lame, mindless, estrogen drenched, unrealistic, annoyingly ""huggy, touchy-feely"" show that would fit very comfortably in a women's magazine and can be happily viewed while swallowing mega-doses of Paxil and appetite-suppressants. BTW, the men are all portrayed as insensitive dolts who, inexplicably,  put up with these complaining, never satisfied, self-absorbed, moody, sex obsessed bimbos. Real men tell these type of women to flip off and real men are too smart to marry these type of women.",1128038400,24,1254,5.2388059701492535
2206159,5,B00079FUI6,"The reason why I mentioned I'm a guy is that a lot of times sitcoms are geared towards certain audiences. For example, 2004's other breakout show Lost, everyone would think that it's just men who watch that and women who watch this. Well it's a very fascinating show so it doesn't matter who it is, it's still entertaining.

The show largely centers around 4 women: Susan(Teri Hatcher), a single lovable klutsy single mom raising a teenage daughter. Bree(Marcia Cross), the wasp-like republican conservative wife married with 2 kids. Lynette(Felicity Huffman) was a career woman until she got pregnant, now she's raising 4 kids with a husband at work. Gabrielle(Eva Longoria) is a wealthy materalistic wife who's just unhappy with the marriage part.

One thing that makes the main 4 great is that each one does questionable things but you still care for them and even sympathize. Susan asks her daughter to break into a neighbour's house to steal evidence of a rather serious crime. Bree ratted out her own son since he's being rather non-chalant of something he did. Lynette yells at her kids and sticks her nose where it doesn't belong which tends to cause trouble. And Eva is materalistic of course but she is having an affair with her gardener, who's underage no less. Yet each one in their own weird way is justified.

One problem I had with shows like Frasier or Friends is that only episodes now and then deal with any ""plot points"". Meaning like Ross breaking up/reconciling with Rachel(of one of many times) or Niles finding getting Daphne. In daytime soaps it's so overwrought and cliche that it's hard to get into it when it's so repetitive. Example: how many times have you seen 2 characters in a conversation than the other just turns their back on them for a part of it? Just talk face to face damnit. Desperate Housewives takes the best parts of the soap operas(the interesting storylines and twists), takes out the worse parts(the overdoneness), and combines it with the more sophisticated primetime feel without that cheesiness that soaps have.

Each actor is also great in their parts. The one that actually surprised me was Teri Hatcher. Prior to this show, how many people ONLY knew her by Lois Lane from the Superman show with Dean Cain? Well add this too. She's really great at physical comedy as well which is really surprising. She can turn on the dramatics so well than do a comedic scene right afterwards, like the pool scene later in the show. Also Eva is good as well playing that seductress siren like woman which shows that even really gorgeous women can act.

The DVD's are also better designed than season sets like say Smallville where all the special features are right at the end of the last disc. Here they're spread out so you have one disc that has an interview with creator Marc Cherry by Meredith Viera of the View and Millionaire then another disc will have a feature on the clothing and sets. Although I must say I really hate Oprah who's became basically her own parody so having a special with her is just ugh. And the commentaries are kind of unplentiful. Some episodes that would've been nice to get a commentary don't get one.

Sure the cast is largely dominated by women but it doesn't mean that it isn't a show that only a certain group can watch. I may hate womanly shows like Sex and the City but a womanly one like this is also great too.",1127779200,5,3390,4.67001675041876

The writing is fantastic, the acting is superb and the music is perfect.  This is everything one could ever want in a tv show, drama, comedy, and heart.  With the main characters being so different from each other there is at least one that everyone can relate to. Bree: the perfect housewife, Lynette: the down to earth mother, Gabrielle: the trophy wife, Edie: the vamp, and Susan, the ditsy, single mom.

This show represents so many types of real families today, I think Lynette's family is most representative of most families today.  However, there are many that are so much like the other women.  Bree appears to have the perfect life, the perfect family, the perfect house, the perfect garden, etc.  But behind closed doors we see how life is never as perfect as it may seem.  Gabrielle, the wife who's desperate to get the attention from her over worked husband.  Susan, the single mom who tries to get back in the dating world.  It's a very empowering show for women and a show that all of America should be proud of.

2206178,5,B00079FUI6,"This amazing mixture of malicious joy, touching slapstick, mocking eroticism or pitiful criminal involvement, established someplace between ""Friends"" or ""Golden Girls"", indeed has the strength to be a replacement for the famous ""Sex and the City"".

Though some Americans are indignant at it (not unmarried ladies, much worse, married women are practicing an immoral life-style; this way would undermine the ""respect for men"") - nevertheless (I think they judge wrongly) - this series have absolutely earned their cult status.

Eva Longoria (as Gabrielle Solis) absolutely surpasses that Denver clan witch Joan Collins in the art of men manipulating. She nonchalantly has a good time with her 18-year-old gardener John Rowland (played by the 26-year-old Jesse Metcalfe). However, she is cheated by her husband (mixing up anti baby pills) Carlos Solis (played by Ricardo Chavira), therefore she expects a baby, and nastily does not know of whom.

The story is always laid out in a manner, that the mishaps of the protagonists hardly sink the spectator into great mourning.

So Martha Huber (represented by Christine Estabrook convincingly nastily), who is disgustingly carrying out an investigation and blackmailing, but oldish but nevertheless very dangerous, is killed without further fuss by Paul Young (played by Mark Moses) - it is hardly unpardonable.

Of course Paul Young still has some more secrets:

Why his Mrs Mary Alice Young (the voice in the ""offstage"": Brenda Strong, earlier film: ""Everwood"") has committed suicide ?

Why does she live under a false name?

Has her son Zach (Cody Kasch) murdered the little daughter (""Dana"")?

Do they have sunk the corpse in the lake or really still another person (dismembered)?

The problems of Lynette Scavo are comparatively harmless (played by Felicity Huffman, earlier film: ""Sports"" Night):

She is troubled with 4 children (2 of them are rather ineducable twins) - for example in front of everyone she (in a precious party evening dress) had to drag her noisy kids out of a swimming pool.

Of course her husband Tom Scavo (played by Doug Savant) does not reward her efforts adequately.

A substantially more complicated show is given by the red-haired conservative, the prudish one ""Law-and-order"" Bree Van De Kamp (unbelievably well embodied by Marcia Cross, earlier film: ""Melrose Place"").

At first she thinks to have everything under control by cleaning the house perfectly.

This does not suffice.

She thereupon additionally tries to get satisfied dutifully the perverted sexual habits of her husband Rex Van De Kamp (played by Steven Culp):

Nastily at a visit of a dominatrix establishment days before her husband had suffered a heart attack.

The requirements on Bree's super management talent are screwed always more highly in the course of the series:

Not only, that she must cope with addiction behaviors and homosexuality of her son, she also hushes the fact that this one (with an accompanying hit-and-run driving) has run over an older woman with his car (the mother of Carlos Solis, dying later in the hospital).

But to escape such gloominess and to make it easy for the spectators to stand by, there is the funny, slapstick part of Susan Mayer too, a sort of princess of the ""faux pas"" (played by Teri Hatcher, she has got the ""Golden Globe"" for this).

However the plumber Mike Delfino, gazed adoringly by her, is not a plumber (but he became entangled in private investigations (played by James Denton).

But it's funny to see him find Susan either locked out stark-nakedly in her front garden or hanging desperately in the ceiling in a broken hole even in his own house .

""Sex and the City"" quite a lot concerned with shoes and other Life style articles.

""Desperate Housewives"" (= DH) satisfies our own longing for mockery and malicious joy and the wish of having the strength to overcome awkward situations;

It helps us to compare and to relativize marriage problems humorously.

In short: DH makes our life easier.

Marc Cherry, who has created this enviably witty plot (he was involved in the works to ""Golden Girls"") has done a good service not only for the spectators but also for himself: Once he had burned down financially so much, that he had to borrow money from his mother; but later on up to 30 millions Americans switched on his TV series running at ABC.

Thirdly, Marc Cherry also has given some actresses an enormous second chance:

Teri Hatcher (one hardly blames ""Susan"" that she burned down the house of her rival Edie Britt (played by Nicolette Sheridan) -

Teri Hatcher waited for almost ten years for a connection success after her film ""Lois and Clark"" .

And Eva Longoria before had only a 5-minute, almost speechless listening appearance in the weak little film ""Senorita Justice"" .

All this lack of success is blown away - and we do not hope, that the judgement (mentioned at first) will gain acceptance, that the ""respect for men"" has been undermined unpardonable and scornful ...",1126915200,4,4989,5.016990291262136

Much like ""American Beauty"" or ""Six Feet Under"", the show mixes humor, drama, and satire to explore the underbelly of contemporary American society.  While the performances of the main cast members are all good, my favorite is Marcia Cross, who brings a touch of the bizarre and mysterious to her character of perfectionist Bree Van De Camp.  Cross creates one of the most memorable characters of recent TV. Fans of Ms. Cross should also check her out in LIVING IN FEAR (2001) and the hard-to-find FEMALE PERVERSIONS (1996), which is sort of a percursor to ""Desperate Housewives"" in its portrait of female angst and also the only film in which Cross (who has a small role as Tilda Swinton's mom) appears topless.",1126396800,12,879,4.925675675675675

Why is this show called a comedy and satire when it isn't a satire, and the women AREN't funny? The women aren't that pretty, definitely NOT sexy, and their characters are boring as hell (and I know they're housewives, but can't these women at least have intelligence, common sense, some cultural interests, or something?). And as hard as this show tries to add suspense with suicides and now a locked up guy in a closet on season 2, it seems to be nothing more but a big publicity tactic. For the most part, the show and the female characters barely even focus on those issues and instead focus on how desperate these people are at making their lives more miserable and ridiculous. If it comes to a point when the producers of this show are just as desperate as the characters (i mean seriously, aren't these women ever OUT of character when they aren't on the show?), then it goes to reveal that this is nothing more but one huge, overrated soap opera with a few laughs here and there.

2206194,4,B00079FUI6,"Before I begin, I'd like to clarify that this is a review of the TV show 'Desperate Housewives', and not the DVD. This is simply because, at this point in time, the DVD has not been released.

I am a self-confessed TV junkie, and every September I eagerly await the premiers of both highly-hyped new shows and tried-and-true old favourites. During the summer of 2004, all of the TV critics were abuzz about ABC's new offering: 'Desperate Housewives'. And, for once, almost all of this buzz was justified. After watching the pilot, I was amazed that a show as irreverent and original as this had actually been picked up by a mainstream network. The opening was dark but snappy (how often does a TV show begin with a suicide?), the cinematography perfectly captured the manicured perfection of the finely-appointed houses of Wisteria Lane, and the dialogue was funny without being obnoxious (unlike, say, any sitcom on NBC) and clever without being smug (unlike, say, 'Dawson's Creek'). The performances were also uniformly excellent, and although Teri Hatcher soon emerged as the de facto star of the show due to her prior 'Lois & Clark' fame, I though all of the other leads were fabulous as well (especially 'Melrose Place's Marcia Cross as Bree Van de Kamp, suburbia's answer to Nurse Ratched). I thought, surely this will be one of the best shows of the season. However, I felt that although the performances remained strong and the dialogue remained clever throughout the season, the show did begin to suffer towards the middle of the season. I do not want to give away any major plot points, but I got the impression that the unifying mystery (i.e. the 'who' and 'why' behind Mary Alice's suicide in the pilot) could have been told it 10 episodes, but ABC stretched it out over 22. In any serialized drama, there is a very delicate balance with respect to how much is 'revealed' in each episode. You must reveal enough to keep viewers interested, but not so much that they feel they don't need to tune in again. By mid-season, the flow of hints had slowed to a trickle; virtually nothing was being revealed in each episode, and without the benefit of the unifying mystery, the show degenerated into a series of interconnected vignettes that, while interesting, existed in a sort of vaccum. Fortunately, though, the series did pick up again near the end of the season, and did end on a high note.

I do strongly recommend picking up this DVD set because, despite my minor qualms, 'Desperate Housewives' was still one of the most original and inventive series of the season. Let's just hope that the next season of 'Desperate Housewives' manages to pick up the pace while still retaining the excellent performances and wonderful dialogue.",1125446400,5,2741,4.817409766454352
2206195,1,B00079FUI6,"Teri Hatcher killed this series for me.  Just playing the stupid, incompetent woman with a child more mature than her got more and more pathetic as the show wore on.  I watched every episode, hooked on what was happening with Bree, seeing a lot of reality in Lynette and wishing the ""Carlos and Mrs. Carlos Show"" would finally develop some depth.

The only thing they could do with Hatcher's Susan character in the end was put an even less intelligent, less mature character in to play her mother, thus giving her an excuse and making her seem like a human being for two episodes.

In the end, this show was only good about every other episode, and sometimes went two weak weeks consecutively before the writing picked up.

The other factor that contributed to the boredom many have experienced with the show is that it repeated itself.  The big revelation about why Mary Alice killed herself happened three times in the show, and they still tried to play it as a surprise on the final episode of the season, when we heard it for the third time.

This show punished loyal viewers by making them sit through the same material multiple times.  I'm glad it's over.

Great pilot, good second episode, mixed blessing from there on in.  I won't be watching series two.",1125187200,12,1262,4.618834080717488
2206196,3,B00079FUI6,"I was never a fan of this series, however, i was well aware of all the plots twists and back stories throught out the whole season thanks to seeing an episode once in a while and the constant talking of other people about this show. However i must admitt that the beggining was well done and actually pretty funny..most of the situations in the first half didn't fail to crack a laugh, and the introduction of a ""suspense"" and mystery story was a big plus, the characters were well chosen and the acting was not so bad. Then...desperation from someone making the show just blew it. Come on! it's impossible to deny that the show lost strenght as it went on and it lost everything that made it what it was in the beginning...funny situations were becoming rare and suddenly not so funny..characters began being non-believable and the ""mystery"" became predictable. Before you knew it the show had turned into one really really overrated soap-opera. This however was not the only kink..golden globe to teri hatcher?!?!? B.S. ,anyone can see that any of the other housewives nominated had more complex chcaracters with more complex situations that required much better acting. Anyhow...the show is far from being trash, but it can't get a higher grade, plus...most of the funny situations work about once..maybe twice, surely not enough if you buy the set and watch it over and over again. And personally..i really think that most of the people that ""love"" this show are those who have those kind of desperate situations shown in the series. So, if you enjoy the reflection of really common housewives problems mixed with a dash of suspense and a tiny bit of comedy (yeah, i guess this is what is shown less in the show) go ahed and buy this product..otherwise, don't bother",1125100800,5,1770,4.768729641693811
2206197,2,B00079FUI6,"I am not the only one to admit the fact that Desperate Housewifes is way to overated.  Desperate started off great.  I was like, ""wow that was really funny and good,"" after the pilot.  The show had everything, comedy, drama, a killer cast (except for one, I'll get to that later), and plot, something television hasn't seen in awhile since realit TV has taken over.  The show was fantasic for the first half of the season, then without warning the show steadily got more and more boring (kind of like LOST did, see other review)  the mystery about Mary Alice was getting old, and I really think that the cast and crew knew that.  Then after 8 months came, the most highly anticipated fanali, when that episode finished I felt like I had just watched an episode of The Golden Girls, IT WAS HORRIBLE.  What...after months of watching that was their kick ass fanali.  Not only did the answer about Mary Alice suck, but the cliffhanger(if you could even call it that) just sucked.  Now for the cast.  Eva, Nicolette, Marcia, and Felicity keep up the good work (Felicity (Lynett) should win the emmy).  As for the ""star"" of the show Terri Hatcher, her acting lacks what the others have, she isn't believable as a person.  Terri Hatcher won the Golden Globe because she is considered the ""star"" of the show, not becuase of her acting, if it was based on that, the only award she might win is a rasberry award(award given out to bad actresses).  Overall the show is just ok, I'll still watch next year, maybe they won't screw up the mystery.  I will however not purchase this dvd.  If you want to watch entertaining shows watch, ALIAS, and Veronica Mars, becuase honestly these are the shows that should be getting the buzz, not a show about women who just complain way to much",1125014400,4,1770,4.539432176656152
2206198,2,B00079FUI6,"Desperate Housewives was a fun little show in the beginning, but as the season went on, the comedy lacked and got repetative.  How many times can Susan fall on her face?  How many times can Lynette yell at her kids? How many times can Bree clean? How many times can Edie flirt? How many times can Gabrielle complain about money?  It got very dull.

  Also, every plot twist that they threw at us was very predictable.  Half the things they told us at the end of the season were things I predicted in the very first episode.  Also, the mystery throughout the season got very over dramatic.  It was too dramatic to be a dramedy (drama-comedy).  Plus, the answers that were given were very disappointing.  It wasn't worth watching the whole season.  Plus, there was no cliffhanger.

  What bugs me even more than the lack of entertainment that this show has to offer is how big a deal people make about Terri Hatcher.  She isn't very good compared to the other women.  I think that Felicity Huffman is phenominal along with Eva and Marcia.

  I would leave this one to the rental stores.  It isn't something worth watching over and over again.  Save your money.",1124841600,6,1158,4.546341463414634

2206200,5,B00079FUI6,"Even before the now popular series aired, I would see billboards and magazine ads all over the place simply saying ""Desperate Housewives"". I didn't know what to think. But my curiousity was piqued. I was determined to find out what this new show was. When it debuted, I was instantly hooked as I thought, ""This is going to be a hit"". I was right.
This has become a phenomenon and rightfully so. The characters, the storylines, the humor, the sympathy we feel for them-all believable. I'm sure we can relate to one, if not all at having been there at one time or another.
I work in a pretty stuffy, male dominated office and I was surprised to discover that it's a hit there as well! Some of my co workers, who are in the 60s, enjoy discussing the show more than I do!
As a HUGE fan of Knots Landing and being a teen when I remember laying eyes on Nicolette Sheridan and falling in TV love. (For those avid TV fans, do you remember her back in Paper Dolls with Lloyd Bridges?) She was awesome as Paige Matheson back then and she's even hotter than ever as Edie Britt now!! (That scene where she's washing her car? HOTT!)  I'm glad for her sake, lightning does strikes twice.
The cast as a whole is terrific and has a lot of potential. Looking forward to a long run, being as desperate as ever to watch!",1123891200,6,1301,4.310204081632653
2206211,5,B00079FUI6,"An appealing and engrossing series that combines a number of genre (comedy, drama, satire, mystery, romance etc.) not just with originality but with really entertaining execution. I was impressed at how the series was able to maintain a cohesive web of plots for the entire season that supports the clues/ideas they presented in the earlier episodes. It was evident that the writers have an outline to the direction of the series.

The show has a great ensemble. The four housewives made their roles their own. Teri Hatcher was very charming and competent handling the slapstick of her character and once in awhile she shows her dramatic chops. She was a revelation. Marcia Cross, who seems to be the crowd favorite was pitch perfect. She played the most interesting and the most complex character in the show. Felicity Huffman gets to play the most relatable housewife and she was just heartbreaking in all her dramatic scenes (the soccer field, telling her husband he doesn't think of her as sexy as he used to). Eva Longoria was good especially with comedy part. I think she needs meatier stories in the next season to explore the more dramatic aspect of her character.

Here are my 5 favorite episodes of the season:

  **********Possible Spoiler***********

1. Pilot - One of the best pilots I've seen. The setup for the main characters was superb because you already connected to each of them. Some very memorable scenes (Lynette in the pool, Gabriel mowing the lawn in her gown, Susan burning Edie's house, Bree sobbing quietly in the bathroom etc.)

2. Pretty Little Picture - One line sums up this episode perfectly ""Rex cries after he ejaculates""

3. The Ladies Who Lunch - a rare instance where all four of the storylines were superb. I love how the theme of the episode (gossip) was sort of evident/relevant in the individual storylines.

4. Impossible - A great Teri Hatcher episode, she proved that the accolades she's been receiving were no fluke.

5. Fear No More - a great ensemble episode that brought most of the characters together in one place. I hope in the next season they do episodes that are more ensemble oriented because towards the end of the series, the interactions among the housewives and with the supporting characters were lacking.

Other notable episodes are: Guilty (a dramatic showcase for Felicity Huffman), Suspicious Minds, Running to Stand Still, and One wonderful Day.

Grade: A",1123718400,7,2421,4.921375921375922
2206212,2,B00079FUI6,"I have yet to see more than one or two episodes of this show, so I am not familiar with it. But from what I've seen, the opening title sequence really is fantastic artistically. And I can see it in my head like it exists already what the DVD packaging SHOULD look like: the same kind of clear plastic as ""Sex & The City"" where it folds. And it should be covered with the Adam and Eve-type of art from the opening, like Hieronymous Bosch's art (Garden of Earthly Delights). It should focus on the large apples and the nude figures with the figs/bushes/trees. This would be fantastic packaging. Don't you think??",1122854400,3,610,4.455357142857143
2206213,5,B00079FUI6,"The best thing about third-place networks is that in their desperation for a hit, they are willing to take risks that pay off for the viewers. This happened in 2000 when third-rank CBS took risks with reality shows ""Survivor"" and ""Big Brother"" along with heavily advertised ""CSI"". Those three shows helped CBS vault its way to the top. Interesting that not only did the other networks pass on ""Desperate Housewives"", but so did a few of the cable channels. Whoever at ABC greenlighted this show deserves a huge promotion, as this show represents one of the freshest, cleverest shows on TV right now. I'm glad they are releasing season 1 on DVD, as the shows are already certain to become classics. A few memorable scenes include Lynette getting into the swimming pool with her fancy dress to retrieve her rambunctious boys at a wake for neighber Mary Alice, who opened the show with a suicide; Teri Hatcher accidentally burning down her rival's house; Bree Van De Kamp insulting her husband at the dinner table by telling her friends what he does after they make love; Lynette deciding to teach her boys a lesson by leaving them stranded for a few minutes until they are taken in by a ""mean"" lady, and my personal favorite: watching Edie wash her car in a scene reminiscent of the car washing scene in ""Cool Hand Luke"". Very sexy!!!

The actresses are the reason to watch this show, as ""Desperate Housewives"" picks up where ""Knots Landing"" left off. Even Nicolette Sheridan of ""Knots Landing"" fame shows up on Wisteria Lane to play the vixen role that gets under Teri Hatcher's skin as they compete for the single stud of the hood, Mike Delfino (played by James Denton). This show plays up the mystery and twists and turns all season long, yet never straying far from the original mystery: why did Mary Alice kill herself? What secret is she hoping to take to her grave? By the season finale, everything is tied up in a brilliant, surprising way. Unlike ""Twin Peaks"", which stretched the original mystery far beyond the patience of viewers, this show satisfies as it adds layers of nuance in between its cutting humor and satire.

My favorite character by far is Lynette (played by Felicity Huffman) as the former corporate climber who decides to become a full-time mother when she has five children under 8 years old (including three rambunctious boys). She is often frazzled as her husband is clueless. Season 2 is set-up nicely with a role reversal between Lynette and Tom, as Tom will take on the stay-at-home dad and we'll see if he manages any better. Every episode, Lynette shines as a person trying to make family life work, though she's in way over her head. She's smart, tough, and one gets the feeling that her husband Tom doesn't fully appreciate all she does for their family. So that is a story line I'm most interested in watching develop in season 2.

In the looks department, Eva Longoria is the hottest of the Desperate Housewives and she uses it to full advantage. Her husband is always suspicious of her every intention, but comes across as dumb if he isn't able to figure out that the young gardener is the one who tends more than their yard. I love the interplay between Eva's character and her husband's. They are a couple who should never have married. Both are selfish in their own right, she for material goods, he for bragging rights. Their games of one-upmanship does get intense at times, but I always end up rooting for Eva. She's a master manipulator, and it doesn't hurt that she's so easy to stare at!

Ultimately though, this show has been a great boon to Teri Hatcher, who I thought was the best and only reason to watch ""Lois and Clark"" a decade ago. She needed to find the right role and this show is it. I'm glad her career has rebounded because of this hit and I'm equally glad that someone at ABC was desperate enough to take the kind of risk most networks are afraid to take. There is no other show on the air like this one and that's a good thing. We certainly don't need anymore ""Law and Order"" and ""CSI"" spinoffs, sitcoms, cop shows, medical shows, or reality shows. A good satire about the way we live, with its undercurrents of mystery mixed with clever humor, is all too rare on TV. For those who don't get this show, well, maybe the satire is over your head. The point of the show is to poke a little fun at the way we live our lives...that constant need to keep up with the Joneses at the expense of truly knowing what our own hearts desire. That's what makes us desperate in the end.",1122422400,10,4533,4.565110565110565

I don't recommend this show for children, there is some language, violence and quite a few 'adult scenes', if you know what I mean. The seaon starts of with a bang.

Funny lines are present too, mostly in the characters of Edie Britt (Nicolette Sheridan)and Bree Van De Kamp (Marcia Cross). The show is not without its level of darkness and mystery. Who killed Mary Alice Young? What is Paul Young hiding? What exactly is Mike Delfino doing in Wisteria Lane? The plot is good, and there is massive eye candy in the form of John the gardener (Jesse Metcalfe) and Mike Delfino (James Denton).

2206218,3,B00079FUI6,"Nobody - and I mean nobody - was higher on Desperate Housewives than I after seeing the pilot episode, which may have been one of the best hours of television I have ever seen. Better still, it holds up to repeated viewings.

So imagine my disappointment as the show became one of the most uneven in recent memory. Yes, there were unforgettable moments such as Bree's comically tragic dinner party and the ultimate fate of her philandering husband, Rex. But more often than not, storylines took far too long to unfold and, even worse, twists were easily figured out far in advance. Anyone who didn't see the big ""revelations"" regarding Mary Alice and her past coming at least three or four episodes before the finale has probably never seen any of the daytime soaps being lovingly mocked by their primetime sibling.

The final episode of the season does deliver several standout moments, but, again, falls far short of what many were expecting. Billed in advertisements as ending with a major, shocking cliffhanger, viewers were no doubt left wondering if they'd missed something when what they got was... well, not to give anything away, but basically a spin on the old ""three people and a gun"" scenario.

Is Desperate Housewives worth viewing? Yes and no. Suspend your disbelief, be prepared for several ""now why the heck would anyone do something so stupid?"" moments and, if all else fails, skip through the episodes and watch the sublime scenes featuring Felicity Huffman and Doug Savant as the most likeable - not to mention relatable - folks on Wisteria Lane, Tom and Lynette Scavo.",1118102400,13,1588,4.874074074074074
2206219,5,B00079FUI6,"""Desperate Housewives"" is an absolute phenomenon! I remember I saw an advert on Channel 4 over here in England advertising this new show and just from the advert I knew I'd love it. So did 5 million other Brits who tuned in when the first episode premiered on January 5th 2005. Since that first episode the nation has been hooked. This is easily the most popular US-import show in the country and literally everyone at my college talks about it on a Thursday morning after the previous night's episode. I must confess, I watch it religiously on my own in our conservatory every Wednesday night and if anyone dare disturb me I will be seriously p***ed off!

In a world saturated with reality TV and bad talk shows, Desperate Housewives is a breath of fresh air. Creator Marc Cherry is a Godsend to women all over the world, and it was clear from the beginning that this show was going to become totally global. I mean I've heard stories about this show getting upwards of 30 million viewers in America! That's absolutely incredible, and this DVD will sell millions upon its release, trust me.

So what makes Desperate Housewives so addictive? For me, there are a number of things. Firstly, the cast is impeccable. The four main stars of the show are Teri Hatcher (who plays Susan Mayer), Marcia Cross (who plays Bree Van De Kamp), Felicity Huffman (who plays Lynette Scarvo) and the sensational Eva Longoria (who plays Gabrielle Solis). My personal favourite is Marcia Cross, because she is just so amazing. She is a gorgeous, fabulous gay icon and she is a true star! Her character is so particular. To begin with, we hate her, but over time she grows on you.

Secondly, I would say the blend of genres make this show effortlessly appealing. The mix of comedy and drama is achieved within a degree of perfection, tossing the viewer from laugh-out-loud moments to those moments of tension. It is a credit to the writers that they have sustained this throughout the entire first season. If we are to look at other successful shows such as Buffy, The X-Files, Friends, Will & Grace and Sex And The City, the pinnacle of excellence usually peaks after the first season, so for Desperate Housewives to hit the mark straight away sets the bar very high. I'm confident that they can improve the formula in the second season.

The imagery of the first season is just beautiful, too. The white picket fences, show home houses and lush green lawns define the show, and Wisteria Lane in general. However, they also serve as a major juxtaposition to the sensational storylines that bubble away under the surface. The murders, the affairs, the breakdowns and the shameful secrets are what keep us hanging on like vultures indeed, desperate, for more. Speaking of the storylines, they may not be the most original or inventive, but its with the amazing cast of actors that these storylines become something on their own entirely. So much happens in one episode that you may totally forget about it in the next! There is a small army of co-stars who decorate the sidewalks of the show as the spotlight falls on our four main characters and the troubles that revolve around them.

The season's main draw is the death of Mary Alice Young, and why she chose to kill herself with a revolver. This question is carried throughout the whole season, from the very first few minutes of the pilot episode where we see her kill herself. Details are gradually revealed throughout the season as the plot thickens. I'm not going to go into much detail about this storyline, or indeed the many others that make this season so jam-packed, because I'm sure you know it all yourself, but what I will say is that I love the way the characters are portrayed. There's a sense of fantasy about the whole neighborhood, in that everyone is a nosey beggar and wants to know everyone else's business. One such example is Mrs. Huber. The way death doesn't seem to affect many of the show's characters is also part of its appeal, as the show adopts an almost retro look at classic comedies with nifty stories and camp backdrops.

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

After so many of my favourite TV shows ended in 2003 and 2004, I was looking for something new to watch, but I never thought I'd find something as brilliant as Desperate Housewives. I say find, when really I should say 'realise' because this show has hit like a tidal wave. I sure will be buying the first season on DVD when it is finally released over here in the UK, and I'm sure you need no motivation from me to buy it as well! This review merely serves as a culmination of TV's biggest phenomenon. Here's to many more great years to come!",1117411200,81,4652,4.631515151515152
2206220,5,B00079FUI6,"I only started watching this show at episode 18, but DH has quickly beome my favorite series. I absolutely love the storylines and the way each of the characters interacts.

For anyone who's never seen it, here's a quick run-down of the show:

In the first episode, the narrator of the series, Mary Alice Young, kills herself. It's later discovered by her neighbors that she was being blackmailed, and committed suicide to hide her secrets. The four wives of Wisteria Lane spend the rest of the season searching for clues that might help solve the mystery behind Mary Alice's past. The clues pile up; from a tape stolen from a marriage counselor, to a baby blanket embroidered with the name ""Dana"".

Bree Van De Kamp is the epitome of the Stepford Wife - perky, resourceful, and perfect in almost every way. Except for one thing: her family thinks she's psychotic. Her husband wants a divorce, and is later caught up in a sex scandel when another wife's little black book surfaces. Bree and Rex have an on-again-off-again relationship, and two children, Andrew and Danielle. Andrew is a seemingly-average kid, except that he runs over a helpless older woman, gets caught smoking weed, confesses an affinity for homosexuality to Bree and Rex, and confesses to a local priest of his plans to make his mother's life a living Hell. Danielle, the 4th, seldom-seen Van De Kamp, is probably the most normal of the group. Further complicating their lives is George, a local pharmacist. Attempting to get back at Rex, Bree starts seeing George, but breaks it off when a reconciliation seems possible. However, George hasn't gotten over his feelings for Bree, and has a tricks up his sleeves.

Next is Gabrielle Solis. A once-famous runway model, she married Carlos for his money, not realizing that he was marrying her as a trophy wife. Unsatisfied with how things have gone in their marriage, Gabrielle seeks fulfilment in their gardener, 17-year-old John. Their affair is nearly discovered by Juanita, Carlos' mother, but she is run down by Andrew Van De Kamp, and later dies, before passing on her discovery. Carlos, desperate for children, starts tampering with Gabrielle's birth control pills, much to Gabrielle's dismay when she finds out.

Then there is Lynnette Scavo. Once a top-notch ad-exec, Lynnette has since traded in her PowerPoint presentations for diapers and parent-teacher conferences. The mother of 4 (a baby girl and 3 boys, two of whom are twins), she spends each day trying not to rip her hair out dealing with the boys. Tom Scavo, Lynnette's husband, is a busy advertiser, and spends most of his time on business trips. Lynnette becomes suspicious of Tom, and also deals with a drug dependency at one point.

Finally, there is Susan Mayer. A single mother, she has a funny way of making a mess out of every situation. From burning AND under-cooking macaroni and cheese to burning down her neighbor's house, her clumsyness has no limits. Her 14-year-old daughter, Julie, seems more mature than her, and ends up doing the recon work when Susan gets a crush on new neighbor, the mysterious Mike Delfino.

Secrets abound on Wisteria Lane. The only way to see them all is to get this DVD set and watch the series. You're never going to find another series as complex and complicated as Desperate Housewives.",1117065600,14,3317,4.891459074733096
2206221,5,B00079FUI6,"From the moment it first aired, DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES proved to be a ratings phenomenon for its network, ABC. Its pilot was the highest-rated show of that week, and the audience kept growing throughout its first season. The reason for its immediate appeal and success, moreso than anything, was that the show was wickedly twisted, often unpredictable and funny. Though creator Marc Cherry refers to it as a satire of upper-middle-class suburban life, ""Desperate Housewives"" functions as a mix of great comedy and pure soap opera. It has mystery and romance, twists and cliffhangers. And it's often very funny.

The writing is generally excellent. You can guarantee at least one moment per episode where you'll laugh out loud, while the ""Mary Alice Young"" mystery that kicks off the first episode remains compelling throughout the season.

To sell it all, the cast of experienced actors is absolutely superb. Teri Hatcher - as the bumbling Susan Mayer - and Marcia Cross - as prim Bree Van De Kamp - give career-best performances. Cross is my personal favorite because she can shift tones from wrenching drama to mocking comedy in one scene, and her plotline thus far is the one with the most meat.

Felicity Huffman, who was wonderful in SPORTS NIGHT, plays harried Lynette Scavo with a tremendous amount of intelligence. Eva Longoria is fabulously silly as Gabrielle Solis, a self-involved former model who amuses herself by committing adultery with her teenage gardener.

The men in the show are great, as well, particularly Steven Culp as Bree's exasperated husband.

2206228,5,B00079FUI6,"I am addicted to this 'primetime stepford wives' soap staring Teri Hatcher (Lois and Clark) and Marcia Cross (Melrose Place) as...(yes, you guessed it) desperate housewives who act up and out in frustration about the things which happen in their lives on Wisteria Lane.

The first episode immediately sets the somber-but-sinful tone for this entire series. A reccently deceased Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) takes viewers into the hidden lives of American housewives on a supposedly tranquil suburban street. A neat series factoid is that this particular street was the same location used for the Tom Hanks film "" The Burbs"" and this first  ""Desperate Housweives"" episode had the highest network airing of any show for the 2004-2005 season.

In ""Impossible"" Bree Van De Kamp (Cross) is shocked to discover that her daughter (Joy Lauren) is sexually active. Because Bree is the prototypical conservative Christian Republican, the revelation obviously jolts her. In this same episode, a teen pool party gets wild (of course) and Justin (Ryan Carnes) came out as being gay, we also learn that Bree's son Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom) himself is gay.

Bree does not learn that her son is gay until ""Children will listen"". When she and husband Rex (Steven Culp) visit their son at a teen drug/alcohol rehabilitation camp, Bree recieves this information second-hand from Rex, who (to his credit) does a comparatively better job of handling the information. He is not as shallow and materialistic as his wife.

Andrew's sexuality is a reccuring story arc throughout this season. Later in ""One wonderful day"" he is home from the treatment camp, and gets in a fight with the gay gardner Justin. In the next season it will continue to be a reccuring theme and delve into even deeper plotlines.

24 episodes in this release make it an excellent purchase for the 'desperate housewife' in your world---certainly including yourself.",1115424000,42,1913,5.115384615384615
2206229,5,B00079FUI6,"Perhaps one of best TV shows of the 2004-05 (along with Lost) season, Desperate Housewives is a wonderful mix of humor and drama and with an added dose of high camp. The series hooked from the start, with it's mysterious death of one character and half naked Jesse Metcalf. All the actress' shine and male actors -like Jesse and James Denton, are brilliant. Marc Cherry, who help produce the Golden Girls, knows what women and gay men like, plus give enough sultry vixens to keep the straight men coming back. There have been some complaints about how we are being teased about what happen on Wisteria lane, but like any good soap opera, you don't spill the beans too soon. Still the show proves that despite the influx of boring reality programs and equally dull procedural shows like CSI and Law & Order (oh, will the hero's get their bad guys? Of course. Too predictable, too boring) a show that is about people and is character driven can succeed. I for one hope Cherry does not reveal all of the secrets of Wistera Lane in this 24 episode first season set.",1115424000,3,1061,4.560209424083769

2206251,5,B00079FUI6,"Mixed with mystery, drama, comedy, sex, romance, twists and turns, and enough soap to fill up a washing machine, ABC's newest sensation, ""Desperate Housewives"", is a incredible throwback to the popular nighttime soaps of dramas of the 1980's(of which I was too young to really watch or know about). It embraces those old shows' conventions with open arms and has a blast in doing so. The show was described so interestingly, that I thought I would check it out. When I watched the pilot episode, you couldn't help but be hooked. Taking place on Wisteria Lane(which is a very popular backlot at Universal Studios), the show is about a small group of housewives who get closer when one of their own commits suicide. Susan(Teri Hatcher), is a single mother and works as an illustrator. She is the heart of the group, and a bit of the ""Lucy"" as well. She instantly tries to get the attention of Mike DelFino(James Denton), a plumber who just moved onto the street. Then there is Lynette(Felicity Huffman), married to Tom(Doug Savant), and a mother of 4 who gave up her executive job to become a stay home mom. A mom who most can identity with. Harried and stressed out, Lynette is always interesting to watch. Bree(Marcia Cross), is a Stepford/Cleaver type housewife. She has perfectly coiffed red hair, clothes that sparkle, and polished house that would make Martha Stewart jealous. It's no wonder her husband Rex(Steven Culp), and kids Andrew and Danielle, have issues with her. Gabrielle(Eva Longoria), is the youngest of the lot. Beautiful and sexy, Gabrielle married the wealthy Carlos Solis, and basically lives in the lap of luxury. And the lap of her 18 year old gardner John(Jesse Metcalfe). Then there is Edie(Nicolette Sheridan), who isn't a housewife. She's the street vixen, a real estate agent on the prowl. Hey, it's Nicolette Sheridan. Narrating the show is Mary Alice Young, the housewife who kills herself. She is played and voiced by Brenda Strong(who also has a recurring role as another dead wife on ""Everwood"". Who's her agent?. Death?). The season sets up a number of mysteries. Why did Mary Alice kill herself?. What does her creepy husband Paul(Mark Moses) know?. What is Mike's real story?. Believe me, there is more to it than this. The show has more twists and turns than a California coastal road. Creator Marc Cherry has created a wonderfully twisted and funny show, with deeply complex and fleshed out characters. It also helps that the cast of women(and the guys)are exceptional actors who truly bring each and every character to life and to it's fullest potential. The show and it's many themes and plot twists aren't always as solid as they want to be. For the most part they are, but sometimes it seems as if Cherry and the writers are thinking some stuff up as they go along, and sometimes feels as if things are a bit too crazy. Then again, that's the nature of these kinds of shows. To be juicy, gossipy, and create unheard of situations. It is part soap, after all. But not everything on Wisteria Lane is just about the ongoing mysteries. It's also about life. Day to day life of these women, and their hassles and struggles. With a little murder, suicide, and sex thrown in for good measure. Hatcher really deserves the success she is getting, and she has proven to be the right person for this role. Huffman is exceptionally good as Lynette, and deserves and Emmy. Equally as good is Cross. With trying to be June Cleaver and having her world and home life face issues and road blocks, Cross displays an incredible talent of showing this woman trying to figure out how to be and what to do. You can't rule out Longoria or Sheridan either. Both bring more character and depth to what some believe are just eye candy characters. They are so much more. Especially as the season progresses, Nicolette's character gets used a bit more and shows that there is much more to her than tight outfits and a constant lookout for available men. Jesse Metcalfe as John is just fine, but as the season goes along, there seems to be less and less use for his character to be there. It's also funny that the 26 year old Metcalfe is supposed to be 18. The show also included Lesley Anne Warren, who had a recurring role towards the end of the season as Hatcher's mother. Absolutely brilliant casting. With it's manicured lawns, immaculate homes, and Mayberry like innocence, Wisteria Lane is a beautiful area, but also shows that even the juiciest dirt, secrets, and lies, can lay under the most innocent of settings. DH is a welcomed treat every Sunday night. Let's hope it doesn't fly too far off the rails too soon.",1113609600,10,4638,4.72716049382716

And because I did that now I can watch them over and over again, whenever i want! When I downloaded the firsy episode it was more out of lack of imagination. I'd been reading something about the show on a tabloid cover while standig in line getting groceries. But after watching the first episode I was instanly wrapped up in the plot. The undercurrent of black comedy was so refreshing. And its just a world so far from my own. Not something I would want for myself but the actors casted in this show pull of their roles perfectly.

Well, IMO, it's the best show on television. It's consistently witty, funny, engaging, moving, mysterious and has a fine ensemble cast. The complex, interesting characters are what make this show as great as it is, and they are played by excellent actors.

My favorite character is Bree Van Der Kamp (the outwardly perfect but privately pained wife with an unfaithful, kinky husband and two bitter teenage kids played PERFECTLY by former Melrose Place star Marcia Cross). She is so much fun to watch and has some of the funniest lines on the show. All of the characters are great though and they are not too predictable or too 'typecast' in their respective roles. Gabrielle, played by Eva Longoria, is a good exmpale of this...sometimes you love her, sometimes you hate her (and want to slap her!) but she never feels as if she is written out of character. Like the others on the show, she is a complex character, and not just a one-dimensional boring drone like many of the roles you see on tv...

Anyway, great writing + great acting makes this the DVD set to get! Can't wait until it comes out!!",1111968000,3,1272,4.648888888888889
2206256,5,B00079FUI6,"Like most other young men that would have seen the adverts and tuned in to the first episode of Desperate Housewives, I was expecting an hour of eye-candy possibly so bad in content it warranted the ongoing companionship of a crossed-out green speaker symbol in the top right corner of the screen.

 How wrong could I have been?

 Desperate Housewives is, in my mind, one of the only original TV series of today that is worth watching and not only that is actually very good. The characters are engaging, the script is interesting and not at all the braindead overly materialistic Sex and the City style claptrap I expected.

 The central story revolves around the genuinely intriguing mystery of the suicide of a resident of the neighbourhood, called Wysteria Lane (good name). This deceased ""desperate housewife"" takes up the mantle of the narrator of the series from beyond the grave.

 This series, still ongoing here in the UK, is one of only three TV series that I try to watch every week, the other two being the new 24 and the English satire comedy, Bremner Bird & Fortune. All three are on in succession on a sunday evening for three hours. I know not what I will do when they all finish, but I doubt I'll be watching any TV.

 Maybe I'll go look up Bree and see if she's free for a drink?",1111968000,,1298,4.5085470085470085

My answer is unfortunately, no. Where I see Lost and Alias strong as DVD box sets, I think Desparate Housewives lacks the intruige that would keep you coming back to watch the DVD over and over again. Don't get me wrong, I love the show, and it is worthy to have its own seasons of DVDs, its just I don't think its worth it to have this series on your shelf. I'd recommend to rent it, I definately will.

I give the TV show itself 5 stars, but the value of the DVD 3. I hope you understand what I mean, if that made sense. Thanks for your time.",1111363200,8,714,3.986013986013986

Its an absolutely great show, that when I found out was to be released on DVD, I was so excited. This and ""Lost"" were my two favorite new shows of the year.

  However, when the press release came out, it indicated that, although this was filmed in HD Widescreen(aspect ratio: 1:78:1), it was indeed being CROPPED to a lousy  and inexcusable 1:33:1(Fullscreen. Please understand that you are not seeing everything that was meant to be seen in that scene, and that is why I am  having to give it four stars. Everything else looks awesome.

2206271,5,B00079FUI6,"I am the perfect example that anyone can enjoy this show.  With a title like ""Depereate Housewives"" it seems to put alot of people off, becasue they don't believe that they can enjoy this wondeful show.  Well I am here to set the record striaght.  I am a 17-year-old High school Senior Male (who just entered the UCSC) and Despereate Housewives has quickly become one of my top three favorite shows on the air (the other two being ""Gilmore Girls"" and ""Veronica Mars"").

The show is about four, sometimes five housewives and how there lives become meshed as they try to figureout the mystery behind why one of there fellow neighbors committed suicides.  Beyond this mystery, each of the housewives have there own troubles at home to over come.  Marcia Cross plays housewife one who has and off-again, on-again relations with her husband because he thinks she is too perfect, Felicity Huffman plays housewife two - a woman who has to deal with a husband who is never home and a home full of little monsters (also known as six and five year old boys), Eva Longoria plays housewife number three, a woman who isn't quit sure if her husband is the person she wants to spend her life with, and finally housewife number four player to perfect by Teri Hatcher is a 40-year-old woman who is recently divorced and has to take care of her 14-year-old daugter, but due to her neurotisisesy's it seems the daughter takes care of her.

I have just scratched the surface of what this show is about.  During the first few episodes the show is trying to figure out what it wants to be (comedy or drama), yet it finally desided upon dramedy.  The series won both the golden globe for best comedic series, but also for Teri Hatcher for best Actress (two additional actresses where nominated as well).

But what makes this series so special is the fact that it was a last chance at a career for most of the people involved.  The creator was literally at the end of his ropes havn't to borrow money from his mother to write the script, and actresses Felicity Huffman and Teri Hatcher could no longer find work.  This show is just a testiment that the old hollywood mantra ""the younger, the better' does not apply anymore.
