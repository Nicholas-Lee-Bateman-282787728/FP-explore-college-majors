8753666,5,B01CPCKRC6,"A truly magnificent documentary presented by one of Britains best Great War historians, Peter Barton.

Barton has really come into his own over the last ten years or so and is a welcome relief from the flood of popular historians who attempt to whitewash or justify Allied failures or German success.  Without overtly stating so, Barton shatters quite a few myths of the Somme, including the recent trend to exonerate Sir Douglas Haig as an effective commander shackled by tactics of the time.  According to Barton, the Germans adapted, so why couldn't the Allies?

Barton also seeks to destroy the patriotic (but flawed in his opinion) view that the sacrifices on the Somme eventually resulted in Allied victory.  Barton argues convincingly that the end of the campaign in November 1916 was simply a date chosen by bureaucrats in 1929 who sought to put a convenient starting and ending date on every battle . . . often to coincide with a rare successful event.  Barton argues that the real end of the Somme Campaign occurred in early 1917 when the Germans finished building the Hindenburg Line and simply withdrew to much stronger defenses to the east, thereby giving up ground but vastly improving their defensive capabilities on the Western Front . . . an inconvenient truth the Allies discovered to their detriment in 1917 at Cambrai and Passchendaele.

Whereas Barton pays abundant lip service to the development of the creeping barrage and introduction of the tank, Barton argues forcefully that the Germans learned more from the carnage on the Somme than the Allies.  According to Barton, not only did the Germans learn how to become masters on the defensive, but counterattacks on the Somme led directly to the stormtrooper tactics that nearly proved decisive during the Kaiser Offensive in 1918.

Bottom line: a highly watchable, entertaining and informative documentary on the Somme that should set the standard for many years to come.  Easily digestible by casual viewer of military history, yet with enough meat to satisfy hardened grognards as well.",1485302400,,2062,5.056047197640118
