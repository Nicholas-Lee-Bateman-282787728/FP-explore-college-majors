2043389,4,B0001Z231I,"As a child, in the 1980's, I enjoyed watching reruns of the Addams Family.  Their mansion full of interesting antiques and ""horrors"" fascinated me.  I saw this VHS for sale at a Best Buy or perhaps a Walmart when I was about 10 years old, or so, and my parents kindly bought it for me.  I must have watched it once a week or more while on summer vacation, one year.  It's fun seeing all the distant Addams family members visiting for their favorite holiday and, of course, the ""poor"" criminals, hoping to steal the Addams's fortune, have bitten off more than they could chew.

I haven't watched it for at least 10 years, since all of the family VHS tapes have been packed away somewhere.  I'm hoping this movie will be released on DVD.",1272240000,6,735,4.407407407407407
2043390,5,B0001Z231I,"My 21-year-old daughter loves this video.  It's quirky and silly, but it's the first video that must be watched for the Halloween season.  The reviewer above does a good job of telling you what the movie is about.  What I can tell you is that it's fun.  I just want to know when I can replace my daughter's copy with a DVD of it.  Her copy has been played so much, she's worn it out.

It's an enjoyable family video, good for sharing an October evening with your kids and other Halloween classics - It's the Great Pumpkin, Disney's Sleepy Hollow, Garfield's Halloween...  All a good wholesome evening of family enjoyment.",1254873600,10,621,4.54054054054054
2043391,5,B0001Z231I,"Gomez has to temporarily leave for Tombstone, Arizona for a day, but finds it quite painstaking to be without his total environment, much like the vampire, thus leaving affairs in the hands of his younger brother Poncho, who is also absolutely enthralled by the ever-lovely Morticia, & harbors the same amorous inclinations inspired by French inunciation.
The house is a bit different, set in a residential neighborhood in suburbia, rather than in a palacial mansion - more of a large house. Yet still, erstwhile crooks again attempt to leach from the Addams' wealth. This time, by crashing the Halloween party {a monster mash, really}, dressed & identified as the ""Boston branch of the family"" - one cross-dressing as Little Bo-Peep, another as John Quincy Addams, accompanied by two bodybuilders, who are extremely poor actors, who from time to time abduct Gomez, attempting to contain him tied up in various locations throughout the house, to which, by his ingenuity, releases himself with the help of Wednesday Sr., who herself has returned from conservatory, enchantingly developed both in talent & physique. They communicate in morse code, thus releasing Gomez from various predicaments, much to the chagrin & frustration of the so-called ""John Quincy Addams"". Along with them, Gomez & Morticia assimilates sneak into the house with no-one the wiser, as it is assumed they are the actual ones, as their clonage is assumed to be so great, which upon observation, is not the case.
Earler on, the spying crooks sent an agent posing as an inspector taxman who is eventually driven insane, unto a complete blubbering & blabbering idiot by the Addams' lifestyle, particularly Thing, & Uncle Fester's ""Playroom"", which includes The Rack {looks to be quite a stress-reliever}, & the noble & adorable lion ""Kitty-cat"", the family pet. A reminder of Togare is readily apparent.
Lurch takes a fancy to Little Bo-Peep, & dances the night away with the erzatz lady. He even shares his passion with her/it - terradaktyl-hunting, but instead, manages to net Mother Frump who was out for a night broom ride, until later in the film, when he realizes the true state, lets forth a moan of disappointment.
One by one, the interlopers are eliminated, by reasons of insanity &/or fear.
Eventually, as most of them are subjected to Fester's relaxation machines, & confess their intentions, & are finally apprehended by law-enforcement. Good riddance to such flotsam.
This obscure presentation provides for select family values - it could be described as an ""after-school special"", as it were, for Infernal Progeny. I found ""The Legend of Cousin Shy"" to be both useful & motivational, & as a matter of fact, inspired in part My own XXVII Nights of Halloween; The Addams Halloween Hymn ""Merry, Shhh, Creepy Halloween"" is an eternal memoriam, & an ode to various spooks of the subconcious; idealizations & archetypes we hold near & dear to Our Black Hearts.
One factor stands solid throughout The Addams Family lore - The Addams Family is a functional family characterization, very poignantly demonstrated in the warm, wholesome ending scene, where each member of the family grasps a black candle, & pace single-file up the stairs singing the Halloween Hymn, up to the attic, where Cousin Shy parts the cobwebs & carves the pumpkin atop the shoulders of the scarecrow, as they all look on in awe, then to open the presents wrapped in black & red, happily uncovering new possessions.
The element of tribalism is always present, loyal to one another, preserving the pack with etiquette, & surrounded in chosen fineries. An ideal of a family to emulate, which in many cases, has already been naturally in practice. Comparisons are inevitably drawn between the Satanic Family & the prorotypal Addams Family. Such a dynamic occurred with Dr. LaVey & Family. I believe this film, as well as all the others, including the original series, will humorously suppliment the overall Satanic Family. Hail Infernal Progeny! HAIL SATAN.",1084752000,8,4002,5.083586626139818
8018410,3,B0001Z231I,I have a copy of this on dvd.  It was copied off of a vhs.  It really needs to be released on dvd.  It's a t.v reunion movie with the original cast.  Including a grown up Wednesday and Pugsley.  John Astin and the girl who played Wednesday are the only ones still around.  The movie isn't as good as the t.v show.  It's interesting to see this in color.  And for fans of the show it's  kind of neat.  But it just doesn't quite work.,1492905600,,432,3.976470588235294

8018416,4,B0001Z231I,"This Addams Family movie could have been something really special but unfortunately did not live up to anything near its potential.  The writers hof this movie just wasted the tremendous talent of the Addams family cast in this movie.  The problem with this movie is it seems to be written by hacks who either did not know or appreciate the true Addams Family Series humor.  The joy of the Addams Family came from the fact the Addam's Family knew in their hearts core without any doubt that they were the normal one's and everyone else was just plain odd weird more to be pitied than scorn.

The movie spent way too much time developing throw away foil characters we ended up not giving a darn about.  The joy of the Addams Family was watching them infect others with their unique Addams Family sense of normal that held sway in their home.  The writers tried to hard to tell a story rather than letting the story unfold primarily in the hands of the Addams clan.  The Addams Family movie focused more on jokes and gags rather than showing things from the unique Addams Family perspective that made you the viewer question the psychology of what it means to be ""Normal!""

The best of the Addams Family happens when you pit the Addam's against normal and normal lost everytime in the most strange yet funny ways.  There were a few bright spots in this movie that make it worth having but most of the potential in the movie was criminally wasted on lame jokes and gags that were stale when first concieved and in 2014 the jokes are rancid.  The timeless fun in the Addams Family happens when the skits challenge the pilliars of what it means to be a normal anything.  The Addams idea of art, science, psychology, medicine, child rearing and so much more had its own unique rich fully fleshed out quality from the series.  All this movie had to do to be great was call on the great wealth of Addam's Family lore taught to the audience in the series.

I gave this VHS Video four stars because; it stars the remaining cast of the Addams Family at the time of its production.  It was so nice to be among the that nice Addam's Family again.  The quality of the writing, and plot is purely second rate.  Were it NOT for the performances of the Addams Family cast this movie would not rate even one star.  I brought my copy of The Original Addam's Family Movie only because; I loved the Addam's Family Series and all it stood for.  This completes my collection unless the Original Addam's Family is released in DVD format!",1389225600,,2513,4.485714285714286
8018417,3,B0001Z231I,"I love the Addams family, the tv show and the movies. This however was a big disappointment. Very borring and tedious.",1375228800,,118,4.666666666666667
8018418,5,B0001Z231I,"This was the only episode of the original Addams Family series that was done in color.  All the original actors are there, including a grown up Wednesday and Pugsley as well as the ""junior"" version of the two.  John Astin and Caroline Jones both recreate Gomez and Morticia Addams to a ""T"", and the story, though a bit hokey in spots, is definitely vintage Addams Family.  Ted Cassidy is still the best Lurch, though the one in the later movies wasn't bad, either.  Too bad he never did catch that pterodactyl!  Better luck next time.  All in all, it's a very nice film to watch at Halloween whilst sipping cider and having a slice of pumpkin pie.",1328400000,4,647,4.487179487179487
