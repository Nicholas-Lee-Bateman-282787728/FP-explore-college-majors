While there is a slight cheese/campy factor to the video, it turns out to be a very engaging conversation between the on-screen personalities.  You'll get a great glimpse into the mind and history of Kartoon, member of Northern Lights Nation.

The DVD chronicles his early beginnings of his first album ""State of Emergency"" all the way to his 10th album ""King of the City"".

If you were a fan of his first 10 albums, this DVD is a must-have to get the inside story on what was going on during each of those albums.  Noxa is also on the DVD for the discussion on the album ""Blowin It Up"".

It's hard to pick a favorite segment of the 10 on here, because each has it's own personality, but, I'd say The Dream Team review was probably the funniest, the Solid State of Emergency and 3 Steps Ahead were the most emotional and the Echo Four segment was most enjoyable.  The surprise guest appearance of Noxa on the DVD was nice too.  The only thing that would have made this a perfect DVD would be if there was an interview with Cam Carl, but it wouldn't have made much sense, other than if Cam was on the review for King of the City, or the fact that he appeared in the Dream Team music video for ""Everything He Is Not"".
What also the DVD lacked was coverage for the rest of the pre-NLN albums such as Ziplock EP, Live From Rumors, SOE Volume 2, and History Lesson, but I understand those couldn't be included because of the natural space limitation of DVDs and it would've just been way too long.

I'm looking forward to when Northern Lights Nation comes out with their own home video DVD.

If you are new to Kartoon, and wanted to get just one album that defines this DVD, I would say to get ""Kartoon - History Lesson"".  That's his greatest hits for this era, and can be thought of as the Soundtrack to this DVD.",1422403200,,2039,4.295039164490862
