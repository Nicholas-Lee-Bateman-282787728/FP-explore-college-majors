8455197,4,B0053DBRLA,"Okay I will set my stall out straight off.  Firstly I am a huge admirer of Amber Benson, both as a person and as a multi-talented artist, so any thought I have concerning a movie she does comes with a certain bias.  Secondly, I'm a 40 year old guy. and as such I'm clearly not the target demographic for this film.

So with stall set is the film worth your time?  I would yes very much so.  The film is funny, has a good heart and good performances from a cast who understand that this is pure fantasy and schmaltz but to their credit, don't really play the schmaltz that hard making it much more palatable.  A couple of female members of my family have watched the film and they enjoyed it thoroughly and as they are the target of this film, I'd call that a resounding success.

So get the film, its fun.",1321660800,,805,4.188311688311688
8455198,1,B0053DBRLA,I was not aware(my fault) that I could not play this dvd on a US cd player.  It is in Australian format that I guess I was unaware was different.  Great movie if I ever get a US version.  Recommended but How many Stars?  I couldn't see it.,1313625600,,239,3.9166666666666665
