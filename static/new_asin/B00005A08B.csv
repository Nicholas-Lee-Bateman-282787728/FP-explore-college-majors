7934662,4,B00005A08B,"This is led by Kenneth Michael Terry who is a blond, young, very muscular white guy. He teaches & demonstrates with help of 2 other young women who don't speak & just smile vacantly. The stage? looks a bit small since it's filled with a lot of Asian decorations & the lighting is dim.
As the other reviewer said, he does a great job teaching all the important posture points including even the shoulder & back being slightly forward.
It starts with a great video & talking history of Qi gong w/amazing footage of strength, even 5-6 concrete slabs being broken on a woman's head, a man pushing back 6 guys all holding & shoving a large wooden log at him, etc.
The Qi Gong movements all have to do with the anus lift, holding it up to draw the energy up & then thinking/intending the energy into the places on the body as mentioned. Each point is done for 1 long 6 count breath in & out & then released 6x. There are also some very simple arm exercises for each area. The video does not look like the pictures in Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's book on Nei Dan, though I will have to read it one day.
I actually had trouble holding in, keeping the posture right, keeping my attention on the right spot & moving my hands & breathing long & slow all at the same time. I can do all that except keeping it with a relaxed slow breath which is VERY important in healing arts. Holding in that area is not usually related to slow relaxed breathing! I will have to learn first.",1185580800,3,1457,4.263537906137184
