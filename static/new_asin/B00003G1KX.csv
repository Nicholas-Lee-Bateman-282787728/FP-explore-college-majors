7918941,5,B00003G1KX,"Having been a jazz drummer myself, I am still puzzled by his left hand - I mean no-body could single stroke roll with their left hand like Buddy.  Al through his solos he had the single stroke left hand fill working to confection.",1399075200,,230,4.348837209302325
7918942,5,B00003G1KX,"I got tears in my eyes twice watching this--someone possessing Rich's unique skills should live forever at the peak of his powers.  As it is, here the then 65 year-old Rich is seemingly undiminished as he spurs on his great big band in this 1982 concert.  Visually, it appears to be a bunch of college kids in identical black tee-shirts ripping through a series of intricate, gripping, and entertaining arrangements with great precision and verve.  Saxophonists Steve Marcus, Andy Fusco, and Walt Weiskopf are the featured soloists, but Rich himself commands attention throughout with his detailed support and astonishing solo spots.  The camera work perfectly spotlights his drumming technique, as well as his energy and forcefulness.  This tape is a compelling delight from beginning to end, and Rich in action was never captured any better than this on film.",1303776000,,861,5.16546762589928
7918943,5,B00003G1KX,"The box say's ""Buddy and his Band at the height of their popularity""  This is a MUST see video for fans of Buddy and jazz.  The sound on this is top notch and of course Buddy is at his best, he wouldn't allow any less.  The highlight {if you can get any better than the best} has to be the extended solo in Buddy's signature piece ""West Side Story "" medly. Again the sound is right on, you can almost feel his intensity, and at the same time his grace.
This tape is flawless, almost 60 minutes of perfection
There is and was only one Buddy.",1003449600,3,540,4.0754716981132075
7918944,5,B00003G1KX,"If you're a Buddy Rich fan, this video is a must-have.  Not only do you get to witness his unbelieveable drumming, but there's a short episode of his temper as well.  At the end of Bob Mintzer's ""Good News"", there is one short instant where the brass didn't quite play a note exactly  together. Buddy smirks for a second, pauses before the last chord, and  clearly says ""what happened? "". He then cues the last chord,  after which he continues to humiliate the trumpet section with more words  and gestures.  Aside from that distraction, the band is smokin' and the  soloists (including saxists Andy Fusco, Walt Weiskopf, Steve Marcus) are  especially strong.",954633600,9,659,4.8125
7918945,5,B00003G1KX,"If you like Buddy (who wouldn't) you have to see him in this video.  He is at the prime of his career and he burns.  My favorite part is the blinding fast single stroke roll that starts soft and low, and then builds to a  feverish pace that only Buddy could acheive.  Ive watched it 3 times since  Christmas and I am in amazment every time. No wonder the audience gives him  a standing ""O"" after every piece.  They were witnessing a drum  god at work!",946857600,21,451,4.162790697674419
