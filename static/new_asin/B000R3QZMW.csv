8198771,4,B000R3QZMW,"If you are of a certain age or just enjoy the music of that period, this is a treasured experience you will want to have over and over.
Seeing as well as hearing these historic musical giants perform in a sort of black Ed Sullivan format is a pure pleasure.
The sound is antiquated, but enjoyable.
The performances are enthusiastic and charismatic.
Just a lot of fun to listen to!
I plan on looking up other recordings in this series!!",1307318400,2,435,4.45
