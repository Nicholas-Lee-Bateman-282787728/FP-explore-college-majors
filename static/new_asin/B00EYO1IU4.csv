First, so answer the question most want to know in deciding to buy or not, is yes, you get the 'money shot'.  The girls could be the girls next door, so that is a positive.  They are very natural looking.  And this is meant to be a nude art DVD, so the emphasis is on sensuality and nudity, not sexuality.  And that delivers.  The first feature with Amanda starts out sort of as a tease, but delivers.  My only complaint with that is, since there is a musical soundtrack, why was the audio left on during the filming?  I didn't need to hear the radio in the background.  The second one with Elena is distracted by frequent flashes.  Now, the camera person is using a 35 mm camera with fill flash.  But the video camera person is recording the scene, so they are at odds.  Have they never heard of reflector screens as light fill?  And one will readily know she is a real red head, to the point of almost vulgarity.  And do you really want to see, even fleetingly, the camera man enter into the frame?  The last two suffer from the frequent distracting flashes, and the last one seems to be somewhat out of focus for much too much of the time.  I first thought it might be due to lower resolution, but there are sharp aspects intermeshed with mushy focus.

So while I would have started with four stars, by the time it was over, the DVD sank to two stars.  The technical flaws were too much for a company that is trying to draw business to their website to obviously sell more product.

If the DVD was at lower price, it would have been worth it just for the Amanda picknick feature.",1519516800,,1723,4.308411214953271
