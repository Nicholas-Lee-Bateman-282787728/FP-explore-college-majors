2795057,4,B000OHZKZE,"Actual detective shows are kind of hard to find now -- let alone a funny, well-written detective series with a hilarious twist. That's where ""Psych"" comes on, on the heels of ""Monk."" While it could use a bit more ironing, this clever series does a good job blending comedy and mystery, and gives us some lovably fradulent guys to follow the adventures of.

Shawn Spencer (James Roday) was trained to be ultra-observant and intelligent by his strict, humorless father Henry (Corbin Bernsen), who wanted him to be a cop. And though he is determined never to be a cop (he doesn't even have a steady job), Shawn can glimpse clues and details that nobody else notices -- even the police.

But it backfires when he reports his observations to the police, and is arrested as a suspect. To save himself, Shawn pretends to be a psychic -- and the gimmick works so well that he decides to do it professionally. So he drags his very reluctant pal Gus (Dul&eacute; Hill) out of a boring job, and they end up regularly hired by the police chief, despite the skepticism of Carl Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), who doesn't buy their act.

And so they set out into a variety of cases: death at a spelling bee, a haunting at a sorority house, a wedding tainted by theft and murder, a ghostly stalking, a cat used as a witness, Civil war reenactments, a comic book convention (where they mess with George Takei's head), alien abductions, speed dating, underground poker, and organizing a surprise birthday party for Lassiter.

Most shows aren't really able to strike a balance between comedy and mystery, but ""Psych"" does. The mysteries are light and fun, and the people making it actually seem to be enjoying themselves -- no hardcore crimes, gore and grimness. That's what makes it so enjoyable.

The mysteries are well done, but each one has enough funny dialogue (""My name is Ichabod Fletchman, Sticky-Icky to my boys"") and kookiness to keep it from ever being dull. Between kooky mysteries -- usually with Shawn flailing around in his pseudo-mystical act -- we get to see what turned him into such a weirdo, and his current relationship with his sarcastic father.

There is a slight flaw, though -- a disproportionate number of the guilty parties seem to be pretty young women. Fortunately this starts lessening as the season goes on. The mysteries get progressively tighter, and the writing cleverer and funnier (""I'm never doing anything blindly with you again! I learned that at the Mexican border. Twice!"").

Roday is hilarious and brilliant -- charming, funny, likable, pleasant, and completely devoid of any dignity (""IIIIII hear a voice!""), with some great full-body acting. Shawn is one of those people who is half luck and half talent; no matter how outragous he gets, things somehow always work out.

Hill is equally great as his intelligent, responsible, geeky sidekick who tries to keep them out of serious trouble, while the crusty Timothy Omundson and tentative love interest Maggie Lawson round off the cast. Corbin Bernsen also makes regular appearances as Shawn's dad, who considers his son a walking freakshow.

""Psych's"" first season is a delightfully frothy mix of comedy and mystery, with solid scripting and likable characters. Definitely a good show to keep an eye on.",1176249600,171,3275,4.897111913357401
2795058,5,B000OHZKZE,"This show is just such fun to watch! It's the perfect companion to ""Monk"" on Friday nights and it always puts me in a good mood. The show takes place in beautiful Santa Barbara and is about Shawn, a twenty-something year-old guy who's developed excellent observational skills under the teachings of his retired cop father. He can't seem to hold down a regular job, so with the help of his childhood best friend, Gus, he opens a psychic detective agency. He uses his observational/detective skills to pretend that he's having psyshic visions with the purpose of mooching cases off of the police force as their 'police psychic'. Of course, not everyone believes that he's an actual psychic, such as his father (with whom he has a strained relationship) and Lassiter, one of the police detectives on the force who is somewhat of a nemesis for Shawn. (Shawn likes to call him ""Lassie"".) Each episode begins with a young Shawn learning a new lesson (very reluctantly) from his father that ties into the mystery/plot of the episode. Corbin Bernsen does a wonderful job as Shawn's disapproving father and Dule Hill is spot-on as his straight-laced best friend, who has the best perplexed reactions to the crazy stunts Shawn likes to pull. (The expressions on his face are priceless.) ""Psych"" is truly delightful and one of the few shows on television that are such light-hearted fun. I'm so glad that it was picked up for a second season and I'll definitely be looking forward to its return!",1175472000,34,1484,4.823529411764706

2795164,5,B000OHZKZE,"Reasons that I am entertained by this series, set in the 1980s:
1.) The "" #metoo movement! "" hates it. ({In one episode the male cop, repeatedly, tells a female to ""shut it"". Same man---in multiple episodes--- tells the female cop he doesn't want her opinion. Once, when that woman tells her boyfriend, the lead, that she doesn't want HIM to do something, he, then, tells his best friend ""women say no when they mean yes""--- and is REWARDED for sexist behavior.})
2.) The two male leads make lots of homophobic jokes.
3.) The show also treats race as if it's a JOKE. The white male lead appropriates black culture many, many, MANY times. Asian stereotypes are the joke in ANY episode that features an Asian actor/actress.
4.) SOME people----read the reviews----actually HATE-watch this show just to get outraged!
5.) This is THE series that LOVES to be HATED: go figure!",1524528000,,870,4.768211920529802
2795165,1,B000OHZKZE,"Since this ""show"" keeps popping up as a ""you might like this"" suggestion, maybe if I express exactly what I think of it, it will stop popping up. If watching this show were the only way to save my life, I would choose death. This is the absolute hands down STUPIDEST waste of time and space ever created....and I saw 15 minutes of the movie ""Ah Wilderness"" so I know of what I speak.  There is not enough money or chocolate in the entire universe that would ever ever ever ever ever persuade me to watch this show. I only wish I could figure out a way to prevent ever seeing a commercial or advertisement for it EVER again.  Please Amazon - take this off my home page.",1524441600,,668,4.2109375
2795166,5,B000OHZKZE,"I started watching this series when I got bored of the other 3 series that I was watching (Yes, all of them were boring and no, I'm not giving you their names - you gotta suffer too, bro). The episodes are not as intense as you would expect from the suspense/thriller/crime/mystery genre and it's not as ridiculously funny as stand-up comedies (well, some of them atleast). The series has the right amount of humor, suspense, action, mind-boggling deductions and....some serious swag. Give it a try, y'all.",1524182400,,506,4.895348837209302
2795167,1,B000OHZKZE,"This show is awful! Especially now in light of the #metoo movement!

In one episode the male cop keeps telling the female cop to ""shut it"". Same male cop -- in multiple episodes -- tells the female cop outright that he doesn't want her opinion. In one episode, when the female cop tells her boyfriend, the lead, that she doesn't want him to do something, he then turns around and tells his best friend that women ""say no when they mean yes"" -- and is REWARDED in the end for this blatantly sexist behavior.

The two male leads make many, many, MANY homophobic jokes. So many disgusting homophobic comments. SO MANY.

The show also treats race as if it's a JOKE. The white male lead appropriates black culture many, many, MANY times. Asian stereotypes are the joke in ANY episode that features an Asian actor/actress, but thankfully that's rare since this show is FILLED mainly with white people.

I hate-watched 6 seasons of this crap-fest, but ""Juliet Takes a Luvvah"" is the most sexist episode ever and I just couldn't deal with it any more.",1523923200,,1043,4.621621621621622

2795171,5,B000OHZKZE,My favorite show. I was hoping they would do another show where they would dream of being old. One in a wheelchair and one on a walker. I could just see them trying to solve a crime!!!,1522972800,,184,4.0

2795255,5,B000OHZKZE,"One of the best shows to ever hit syndication. It is clever, balanced and . If you have ADHD or just love a clever, funny plot this is it! The cast is chalk full of rock star level performers who all stand out as time goes on. Give it a try!

P.S I met the guys and they were super kind in person to everyone as well as funny. Watched 'em tell security to Suuuuuckkkk iiiii! in tandem and sing song off the cuff when a girl with special needs wanted to talk to James. The security guy had told the girl no talking just prior to her stepping up in line. She was clearly super sad. James visibly didn't agree with that. Just amazingly polite. Dule Hill was surprisingly soft spoken and polite as well. If you get the chance to speak with either of them, do it. Psh! Finally, they stayed past their flights to make sure everyone had a chance to talk with them.",1522627200,,857,4.131736526946108

2795258,1,B000OHZKZE,"Too much slapstick comedy for my tastes. Not a serious show, but funny in some parts and really stupid in others. I can't recommend it for adults, it's too dumb, yet it's not really suitable for children. That people really like it is a sad commentary on what is available. By the way, this is my last review since there is no point wasting words that accomplish nothing. Thanks, but no thanks.",1521849600,,394,4.486111111111111

You know how you load up a DVR with your favorite shows, and over time, many of them wind up having like 5 or more episodes in the DVR because you actually don't have time to watch them all?  Well, my fiancee and I never got behind on this one!  Seems like a lifetime ago, but this season, in my opinion, is better than all the rest, because it was what I call, ""The Honeymoon Time.""  You know, think of your favorite food, or game, or book, or song, and how nothing compares to when you discovered how much you love it.  Then, after a while, it's just like the saying about relationships that have gone on for a while, ""The Honeymoon's over.""

All 8 seasons and the new movie that just came out. I keep coming back no matter how long it has been. Shawn and Gus are my guys and I simply adore them. Fake Psychic. Real Detective.

2795463,5,B000OHZKZE,"My review is not of any DVDs but watching via Prime video and a review of the show itself.  I am a ""late comer"" to be a fan.  ION has been running this show for awhile now but I wasn't watching full episodes just catching bits and pieces.  That experience left me wondering why on earth this show was so popular because it just seemed over the top and stupid.  When I finally caught a couple of full episodes my opinion began to change and I am currently working my way through the Seasons on Prime, as well as watching Pysch, The Movie.  So yeah, I love it now!

Mysteries have always been my favorite (will watch an episode of Murder She Wrote any time I run across one) tied with good comedy.  Initially the physical, ""out there"" stuff was what put me off but as I have learned the back story and really watched, I feel Roday and Hill are genius at physical comedy.  The writing is intelligent and great.  The wit is sometimes so dry and ""deep"" it can fly right by.  The whole cast is strong with each actor making their part very real.  And then there is the ""character"" of Santa Barbara (I LOVE Henry's house) which I found out today is actually Vancouver, Canada.  Wow.  Makes me want to visit!  I feel like the technical aspects of the show's production are very good as well.  Love the various settings and ultimately the range of cases.

While I really appreciate good acting and scripts, I have learned some shows are just too ""dark"" for me ... stick in my head in a bad way.  Psych is going to be in my top five of all time favorite shows because of all the reasons I've already mentioned and simply, for me, it's the best of all my faves --- humor, intelligent wit and mystery!  Six months ago I would have never believed I'd be writing this!",1515801600,,1754,4.279635258358662

2795514,5,B000OHZKZE,"Psych is its own genre. If there are other shows out there like this I have yet to find them. We have loved this show for years. It's one that my husband and I have binge watched often. So glad to see it here on Amazon. Haven't watched for a while, I forgot how funny the show was.

Psyche doesn't have the draining emotional toll a traditional crime drama, nor do you have the random callousness and dumbing-down of many comedies. The tone is light-hearted and silly but never ridiculous or slapstick for slapstick's sake. The writing is very clever and versatile. Each member of the cast adds something irreplaceable. Each episode is neat and tidy with over-arching story lines and traits that build these roles into endearing characters that you'll really enjoy watching and will be sorry to say goodbye to after eight seasons.

I'm not sure I would exactly call it family-viewing fare; maybe PG-13, but we are pretty strict about the media our kids consume. However, it has been a while since we watched and back then the kids were just arriving. I'll have to watch again with an updated ""parent's eye"" to evaluate.

The first season is probably the least smooth of all eight, if I remember correctly, but once the show gets going there is no stopping it!",1515283200,,1259,4.63677130044843
2795515,3,B000OHZKZE,"I'm having trouble getting through the first season, so I'm not sure how there are 8. It's a great show when you start off, but it gets repetitive fast and all the characters are special kind of morons. Kind of strange when most of them are police. And the antagonist doesn't really have any reason to continue being the antagonist, which makes all the interactions senseless. I hope with so many seasons, that the writing gets better.",1515283200,,435,4.662337662337662

2795535,3,B000OHZKZE,"I love the basic premise to this very modern version of Sherlock Holmes, and I think the two main characters work well with and off each other.

But the repetitive, repetitive, repetitive third grade comedy rehash goes from tedious, to annoying to downright irritating after the third episode. The monotony sidetracks the entire story in the episode, like dull filler content in order to get a complete 45 minutes into an episode because you really have nothing useful to say or do, or worse, can't imagine anything better.

I really hope this is going to get better, that the writers get their second childhood midlife crisis out of their systems, and provide a more subtle approach to the comedy. Otherwise it really will ruin an otherwise terrific new Sherlock Holmes series.

Well enough time had elapsed that I wanted to revisit Shawn & Gus (PSYCH's protagonists) but was disappointed to find out that the PSYCH seasons were no longer available from big RED. Worse, the only physical media available for this great TV show are crummy old DVDs (not BluRay). So I was delighted to see Amazon pick up the show for Prime members. James Roday's portrayal of Shawn Spencer's tongue in cheek approach to fighting crime consistently gives me laughs and chuckles. PSYCH is a ""dramedy"" (drama + comedy) and IMHO (and viewing experiences) fairly unique; I'm not aware of another show like it.",1513641600,,746,4.8359375

Once Season Two is under way, Dule Hill and James Roday are at the top of their game, so is the rest of the cast. The excellent chemistry amongst the crew is evident, and it pays off. Everyone knows their place, and how to pull a deluge of laughs from such a far-fetched and dubiously eye-rolling plot. It is fun, interesting, and sometimes, even knee-slapping hilarious!

2795580,4,B000OHZKZE,"I love the silliness of Psych. This comic duo work so well together. This is not a show that aspires to be great drama. In fact, it often fails when dealing with real emotions, but it is great as a sort of ""grown-up"" kids detective mystery series. The premise is that a police detective teaches his son to be so hyper-observant that he can pass himself off as a psychic. This is a fairly constraining premise, but they make the most of it in sometimes odd and unexpected ways. What makes the show so enjoyable are the silly antics of Shawn and Gus as they stumble their way from one mystery to another. The series has been cancelled but it had a good run.",1494892800,,655,4.290322580645161

2795634,1,B000OHZKZE,"Okay, let me say first that I am a huge fan of this show, all eight glorious seasons. However, it's important that I review the product that I purchased accurately in its entirety. The problem with this DVD version of Psych is that the resolution is not high definition, it's standard definition. So speaking sarcastically, why don't they just put it on VHS if they're going to give me a low quality product? This show was first shown in 2006, so it was shot on digital film which is a high definition medium, so why isn't the DVD in hi-def? Frankly it looks like it was shot in the 1980s, but my DVDs of Magnum PI have sharper images that this lousy DVD. So whoever threw this DVD together really REALLY did it on the cheap. So now you have been forewarned. There is another DVD packaging version on Amazon besides this one. Maybe you'll have better luck with that one or just waiting until the series comes out on blu-ray, if that ever happens. Don't buy this version.",1478822400,9,970,4.424581005586592

The humor is great for the whole family and the show plot-wise is fantastic. I fell in love with this show when it was on-air and you'd be crazy not to give it a shot! Whether you liked it on TV, miss it on Netflix, or are just curious after hearing about it, Psych is one of the best comedies in recent television, hands down.

The humor is great, the characters are likable, the plots are fun and interesting. I cannot recommend this show highly enough.

2795703,5,B000OHZKZE,"Psych was one of the USA network's better original shows.  It starred James Roday, as an ultra observant slacker who manages to convince the local police that he is a psychic (after being arrested for having information that was too good when calling in a tip) and helps them solve crimes.  He ends up dragging his best friend Gus (played by Dule Hill) and his father Henry (played by Corbin Bersen) into the charade.

The show ends up being part mystery of the week crime drama, part comedy and part tongue in cheek farce that never takes itself too seriously.  Each show starts out with a flashback to the mid 1980's where young Shawn (and sometimes Gus) are learning some lesson via Henry, which usually ties into the episode.  In the present they have to solve some crime with the climactic moment always being some psychic reveal to solve the case at the very end.  While there was not as much character development in season one (it was mainly setting up and introducing the characters) there was some.  All of the supporting cast did great.  Tim Omundson did a great job as the no nonsense detective who had a love hate relationship with Shawn and Gus (mostly hate in season 1), yet was able to bring a human side to Lassiter every so often.  Ann Dudek (who played Lassiter's partner in the pilot episode) would be replaced by Maggie Lawson, which I think ultimately worked out for the best in terms of giving Shawn a love interest and an opposite personality to play off Lassiter.  Kirsten Nelson also does a great job as the Chief of Police who agrees to hire Shawn and Gus and either buys (or plays along with) the fact that he is psychic because it help the department solve cases.

For those who get the DVDs there are a ton of extras.  A lot of deleted scenes, a gag reel, and commentary on many of the episodes.  Usually with the series creator Steve Franks and either other show runners or writers or the actors.  All in all a lot of material for those who like going through the extras.  While it may not be for everyone, if you generally like case of the week crime shows, and good comedy, this is definitely worth checking out.",1454544000,,2145,4.4781491002570695

So, imagine our joy when we discovered this first season in a DVD set.

It is definitely not perverted and obscene like so many TV shows put out by Hollywood these days. That pulls it up, but the rest of this show just kind of pulls it down. I found the humor to be a complete swing and a miss. It was pretty cheesy. In addition to that, the detective element and aspect to it just was not entertaining. The acting was not very good, and lead actor James Roday just didn't have any real delivery. His delivery was a little too similar to Zach Braff in ""Scrubs."" It lacked any punch or realism, it was a little too cutesy. The show is something between ""Monk"" and ""Scrubs,"" but is just kind of a swing and a miss.

2795802,5,B000OHZKZE,"This is a fantastic beginning to a show that retained its quality *almost* to the end.  Often shows go steadily downhill as they progress - not this one.  (Except for season 8, which doesn't have very many episodes anyway.)

I love this show (all except the 8th season which kind of crashed and burned to a stop, with only one or two good episodes - season 8 is worth watching but not owning in my opinion).  Psych is constantly witty all the way from the first episode of season 1 to the last episode of season 2.  I love the characters (you grow to love pretty much everyone in the main cast) and the plot is awesome.  Psych is a murder mystery show that is brilliantly successful without being dark, scary, gory, or intense (excluding season 8 which ventured a bit into pointless gore/intensity).

All in all, I HIGHLY recommend season 1 and the following seasons up to season 7.",1422662400,6,882,4.475

2795822,4,B000OHZKZE,"Shawn is pretending to be psychic so the police department will hire him to solve cases for them. Apparently they won't take him seriously if he is just really intuitive. The best part is his interactions with his best friend Gus. Those two are great together almost like a more cerebral version of Abbott and Costello. When they get to bickering with each other and comically playing off each other, its like they are making it up as they go. I mean the entire show is really funny, but the banter between those two is pure comedy. Its amazing how much crime there is in little Santa Barbara because they are kept really busy with a lot of crazy murders and Shawn always solves them in some weird wacky way. If you like Monk, I think you will like this show too. The other secondary characters like the two cops Lassiter and Jewels, who are in charge of them or something are funny too. Its clever and well written. I guess I hoped Shawns character would develop more. Hes so childish and kind of a jerk and he doesnt seem to have learned anything.

I'm giving it 5 stars because this is supposed to be a PRODUCT review, and I've seen every episode of the show and all the bonus features in season 1, no thanks to Amazon.com LLC (which is what it lists as the seller), I checked out the box set from my local library.
Now, onto my review of Psych.

Psych is hands down the funniest show I've ever watched, and it's become my favorite for a lot of reasons. The show follows Shawn Spencer (James Roday), the ""psychic"" detective, and his best friend, Burton ""Gus"" Guster (Dule Hill), the pharmaceutical salesman. At the end of the pilot, Shawn opens up a psychic detective agency, Psych, and even though Gus didn't want to be part of it, Shawn put his name on the lease.

Shawn is hyper-observent - thanks to his father, Henry Spencer (Corbin Bernsen), training him when he was a kid, as seen in the flashbacks at the beginning of most episodes - and has an eidetic memory. He uses those to convince people that he actually is psychic, though he's nearly been caught before. He doesn't really take anything seriously, and before opening Psych, he just bounced between jobs, avoiding commitment. Shawn is constantly making obscure 80s references, giving Gus nicknames, and making Gus do stuff he doesn't really want to do. Gus is smarter than Shawn and usually has to explain things to him. He ends up correcting Shawn a lot, to which Shawn almost always replies, ""I've heard it both ways."" Gus also has the super-sniffer, which comes in handy every now and then. He's scared of a lot of things, which doesn't help Shawn, but his screaming and running away is priceless.

Head Detective Carlton ""Lassie"" Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) is a 10-year veteran of the Santa Barbara Police Department, and he prides himself in his shooting and his ability to solve cases. He's skeptical of Shawn, and doesn't really like him because he steals his cases and solves them with little more than a hunch. Quite frankly, Shawn makes Lassie look pretty bad, but you know Lassie had to be good before Shawn came along, or else he wouldn't be the head detective. Junior Detective Juliet ""Jules"" O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) is Lassiter's new partner after Shawn exposed his secret relationship with his old partner, Lucinda Barry. Her gentle personality compliments Lassie's nicely, and it's no secret that Shawn cares for her.

Unlike most crime shows, Psych has a nice balance of comedy and mystery. And there's not really much gore, so it's something you could watch with your family. They do curse a little, and the season 1 ""blooper reel"" isn't censored, so just watch out for that.

The actors portray their characters quite nicely. I don't think I've ever seen a show with a more perfect cast. Shawn's psychic ""episodes"" usually involve Roday having to flail around on set, and Gus's fears have Hill screaming that hilarious scream. I almost feel bad for Omundson because of all the strange stuff that's written for Lassie, but I've watched the audio commentaries and it doesn't seem like he minds it too much. I heard he enjoyed riding the horse in ""Weekend Warriors"" and I enjoyed every scene he was on a horse because he had that ""face wig"" on.

I'm sort of rambling on, now, so I'll finish up with the pineapple. It's a running gag because of James Roday's improvisation in ""Pilot"" when he grabs the pineapple and says, ""Should I slice this up for the road?"" Since then there's been a pineapple in almost every episode, usually hidden, and a lot of Psych merchandise is or has a pineapple.

So basically, Psych is kind of silly and ridiculous, but that's what makes it so awesome. So if you like crime dramas and comedy, you should really watch it. Maybe even if you don't like crime dramas.",1394582400,3,3787,4.685714285714286
2795862,5,B000OHZKZE,"Psych is a comedy show about Shawn Spencer, a fake psychic working for the Santa Barbara Police Department. He uses heightened observation and deduction skills to solve cases for the SBPD.
 There are several great characters including Shawns tap dancing best friend, a skeptical Head Detective, and a wise father who can be difficult to handle at times. Of course, there is also the pretty blonde as one half of the will they or won't they? pairing. Each character has their own entertaining qualities and all together, they make the show fun to watch.
 Shawn works with the detectives as a psychic consultant to solve murders. He uses acute observation skills to make breakthroughs in the crime and find leads and reports the information to the police by having a vision. He flings his limbs around making odd noises and pretending to communicate with spirits. Almost everyone believes he is a real psychic except for Carlton Lassiter (the Head Detective) who is constantly bothered by the respect and admiration that Shawn receives despite his ridiculous antics.
The show is full of references to other TV shows, movies, and celebrities. The interaction between Shawn and his best friend is very amusing and often hilarious. Gus, the more responsible and cautious of the two, and Shawn constantly go back and forth with witty insults and nonsense name calling: Gus, don't be this crevice in my arm. Despite bickering, they are really close and care deeply about each other.
Even though it is a show about murder, the tone is usually light and entertaining. It is not filled with gore. Other than the occasional stab wound or bullet hole, the most that is ever seen is a pale dead body that might have some blood on it. It is full of quirkiness and running gags that make for many laughable moments. Overall, Psych is a great show that is fun to watch at any time.",1394582400,,1865,4.788819875776397

It is an awesome, hilarious and silly show, that will always have you laughing. Even though you sometimes do not understand the 80's, 90's references, that hardly matters. Their witty banter though, makes the show even more exciting. One thing I have to say from what I have read from all the reviews is that Shawn (james Roday) and Gus ( Dule Hill) are not Detectives. They are best friends, and Gus is constantly getting pulled into cases because of Shawn. Shawn is also not in any form a detective, he is just hyper-observant and because of this he is able to play the part of a ""psychic"", and the police department constantly calls on him for help with certain cases because of his ESP.",1389484800,,807,4.386666666666667

Sean solves crimes together with his friend Burton ""Gus"" Guster (Dule Hill) by using astute observation skills taught by his overbearing father.

The characters can actually be serious when needed, and even sympathetic, showing that ALL of them have a ""human"" side. The development between the different characters moves at just the right pace, so the viewers can see even the important ""frenemy"" relationships developing. It's a wonderful show. Oh yeah, and look for some kind of appearance of a pineapple in every episode. It makes it just that much more fun. It's such an awesome show. I was so happy to see my son really getting into it too.

2795930,5,B000OHZKZE,Psych is one of the best shows ever Shawn is my favorite character it's about this psychic Shawn who has a best friend named gus and their detectives they love to eat all I can say is this show got me to crack up laughing omg it was so hilarious. I love their little song suck it. My advice watch this show.,1365552000,,307,3.967741935483871
2795931,5,B000OHZKZE,Ok - CANNOT GET ENOUGH of PSYCH! I gotta get the rest of this series and I gotta get it NOW! The writers do a great job of entertaining while spinning suspense to keep you interested. Much better than recent season with foul and inappropriate language.,1365552000,,252,4.5
2795932,5,B000OHZKZE,"This is not your ordinary detective show. Shawn Spencer is hyperobservant with a photograhic memory and tries to use his ""gift"" to help the police solve crime, but the police won't take him seriously...until he claims to be psychic. Shawn brings his best friend Gus in on the ruse to help him pull it off. I really enjoy the way that each episode opens with a scene from Shawn or Shawn and gus's childhood that gives us insight into why they act the way they do today. Psych is a well written, well acted, and well produced series. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes comedys, mystries/who done it's, or just wants to be entertained. One if the bonus features is the international pilot which contains additional footage not found in the domestic pilot. I'm not sure why the international pilot isn't the only pilot, other than that the bonus features are just average. The audio and video are very good quality.
I thoughly enjoyed series one of PSYCH and it has become one of my favorite tv shows of all time. I can't wait for series 2!",1365120000,,1051,4.536842105263158
2795933,5,B000OHZKZE,"Psych has very quickly become one of my favourite shows ever. The witty dialogue, hilarious characters, smart scripts, pop-culture references, high production values, and just plain hilarity boost it to memorable new heights.
Season 1 isn't the strongest season of Psych, but certain kicks it off memorably. If don't already watch Psych, you should really start, you won't regret it!",1364342400,,383,5.4

2795938,3,B000OHZKZE,"I try to find value in every song, movie or TV show I watch. This series has been on for sometime and the ratings shown are weighted quite high. I bought the first two seasons and while they contained a good doses of ""Mind Candy"" they left me wanting for something solid to bite into. Each of the segments/weekly shows had a distinct cookie cutter similarity and in a low budget way. Back in 2005 I started developed a sincere dislike for 18 minutes per hour for the 42 minutes of content. I developed a taste for several of the TV programs but chose to wait till each TV sitcom or movie came out on video and invest more of my time on physical activities. Because of his I only purchase time proven movies like; Rich Man Poor man, Chiefs, and TV shows like; the Closer, The Gifted man, Veronica Mars, et al and watch them when ""I wanted to, without the weekly cliff hangers"". That being said, in Psych the banter between Roday and Dule became more and more predictable and the negative prattle seemed to loose its flavor. Because of this  I have stopped watching TV and my knowledge of really good TV shows  has diminished.  I have switched to movies, but admittedly chose to purchase additional seasons of Psych and a select few to search for humor in the action packed movies I consume nightly and have learned to enjoy. However, I still feel that 3 stars maybe a gift for Psych.",1363132800,,1382,4.411764705882353

2795943,5,B000OHZKZE,"I love this show and I mean love it. I started watching this a few years back but never got into too it as much because I was young i think. Now that I'm 21 I understand so much better. I love Shawn and Gus so much. Shawn is much more funnier but all the charterers work good. I think my favorite episode is Poker I barely know her because it was like a comedy and not a drama. Scary Sherry Bianca's Toast freaked me out a little but it was still good. No matter how bad a episode is it would be because of the guest stars never Shawn or Gus. He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, He Loves Me, Oops He's Dead, 9 Lives, Forget me Not, From the Earth to the Starbucks and the Pilot are also favorites of mine. I only wish the season could be longer like other shows but it still gives over 11 hours of comedy and drama. Very good show. I recommend it to anyone who loves the show.",1360800000,,870,3.893258426966292

2795945,3,B000OHZKZE,It has some entertainment value. There are so really funny moments. Main actor James Roday is the star and he deserves credit. Actor Dule hill is Roday's sidekick but he's way less relevant than Tonto was to the Lone Ranger. Try season 1 and then decide whether you want to move on to the next season or not.,1360713600,,308,4.327586206896552
2795946,2,B000OHZKZE,"The continual negativity of Gus the sidekick turned me off completely.  The pilot was a test of patience, with the psych acting like the very worst TV psychic you have ever seen, and the sidekick being negative about Everything.  The pilot plot was transparent - the main character acted like a fool while trying to hoodwink the police about his make-believe psychic skills.  There is no chemistry between the psych and his buddy.  Why does the psych want the sidekick to join him anyway?  He adds nothing but negativity, and occasionally drives the psych around.  Being around  negativity like that would drain almost anybody, but apparently not the writers of this unfunny, uncreative mess.",1360195200,2,692,5.017543859649122

So far I have all but season 6 and will be going for that one soon.  I have had some mini marathons of Psych with my collection.  It has not gotten old yet, so probably will not be a set that I ever trade in.",1359331200,,388,3.63855421686747

2795958,5,B000OHZKZE,"This series kind of grew on me as it came out  a few seasons later while Monk still reigned supreme in the USA channel.

James Roday initially irritated the heck out of me but the ensemble cast they got as regulars have really rounded out the series premise and made this a good show to watch. Thus my collecting the series seasons.

I know I can watch the reruns regularly  but I collect series seasons mainly for my sisters' families abroad. They never get full sequential seasons of popular TV shows here in the US ( TV channels abroad pay huge fees to US companies for the right to show them  just once or twice and a lot of European channels can't justify the outlay ) so I bring it to them.

This was a great buy for me as I bought it on CyberMonday. I had previously gotten the later seasons but had lost track of what season was missing till I called up the relatives.

I would highly recommend you buy this series collection if you've never seen it before. Or even if you have as the show has really gotten better as time has gone on and we care more and more about the characters.",1358035200,,1090,4.211538461538462
2795959,4,B000OHZKZE,I actually like the show.  It is kind of different and it grew on me when I watched it on ION when they played it over and over but then they stopped it and I was actually looking forward to it being on.  I went ahead and bought the first 2 seasons when they were selling for 12.95 at the time.  I then bought 3 & 4 season a couple weeks later & they were 8.95.  I now want to purchase 5 & 6 but it is now 20 bucks.  I will wait until they come down again before I buy 5 & 6.  All in all...I  would recommend these to someone who wants something different in the comedic and quick witted line of a show.,1357948800,,603,3.738095238095238

We really didn't like season 7 at all. Season 8 started out with such promise with the first episode but we have been quite disappointed since. There are a few jokes and scenes that aren't kid friendly, so we would recommend keeping younger than tweens at bay for now.

2795985,5,B000OHZKZE,"""Psych"" is an outstanding show, and it manages to do what precious few others can- it makes a procedural crime show FUNNY! Whereas I find most procedural crime dramas to be dull, depressing, and by-the-numbers, ""Psych"" is anything but. Even when a crime has been committed, it comes off as being funny, because the show is presented in such an outlandish manner. The chemistry between the main characters (Shawn and Gus) is pure perfection, and the supporting cast is always firing on all cylinders. Although ""Psych"" is a show that has continued to improve as the seasons go by and the actors gain experience, Season One has held up remarkably well, and it's a solid investment of time for anybody who wants to try something a little different. If you're tired of the gore, bloodshed, and somber faced detectives that populate the crime dramas of most networks, give ""Psych"" a try. It has the wonderfully cheesy flavor of the USA Network, and it's outright hilarious- apt to make you laugh, and give you a nice break from all those CSI clones.",1351296000,2,1043,4.767955801104972

I'm pretty weary of cop shows that take themselves so seriously and all the actors act like they're going for oscars with every line. Thankfully, this show is the antidote for the glut of over-dramatic cop shows out there.

As for the show, I recommend anyone who is thinking of buying Season 1 should go ahead and buy all of the first 5 seasons, because they are all a laugh fest. Although there were some ""format"" changes, the zaniness of Shawn and Gus is consistent throughout, and the jokes always land. Even after my 4th time through all the DVDs, I'm still laughing. The chemistry of the cast is just perfect, but Shawn and Gus are the best. The show needs both of them to work, and they just have a natural bond on this show. Even when they get ""mad"" at each other, it seems funny.

Definitely would recommend this show to everyone.",1337126400,,790,4.331081081081081

The show is very funny, with great elements like relating portions of Sean's childhood (usually a lesson learned) with the case in the present day. Sometimes I cringe at the over the top antics Sean does, and the way the local police are portrayed, but Gus more than makes up for it. He makes the show worth watching.

It's along the same vein as The Mentalist (another show I love, though very different dynamics), Monk (which I hate, but again different dynamics), and Unforgetable (which I haven't watched enough to judge). If you like any of those three shows, you should at least try to catch an episode on USA and see this one for yourself.",1335312000,,877,4.440993788819876

Steve Franks writes quite a few of the episodes as well so the quality is kept amazingly high.

Everyone on the planet should watch this series even if you are not a comedy fan. It's a great game to play to try to figure out the killer before Gus and Spencer do.

I finally was so intrigued I wanted to watch full episodes and seeing there were 5 seasons available for sale purchased seasone 1 to give it a shot.  OMG!!  I am so glad it!  This show is one of the most witty, well written, superbly acted and uniquely crafted on television.  The great James Roday is suberb as Shawn in every single episode.  Using his photographic memory to pretend he is a psychic provides him with material for a tour de force performance every episode.  And his side kick Gus played by Dule Hill is his perfect partner.  This show works on so many levels for each character is superbly realized and all come to life with an all around excellent cast.  When a show is really good you can fall into it from the very first episode.  And that is what happens with PSYCH.  The premise is established in the pilot and each episode is a wonder.  This is also the type of show that is a must own if you are a fan for each episode can be watched over and over just for the acting and the laughs.  And the laughs are never ending, often resulting in belly laughs.  This is such a feel good show.

Set against the premise of a young man with outstanding skills at observation, forced by circumstances to pretend to be psychic (then embracing it), James Roday and Dule Hill treat us to laugh out loud moments in show after show.

Shawn (Roday) constantly flips out pop cultural references from well before his time. He must have spent a good portion of his youth watching every possible rerun. LOL Catching and figuring them all out can be a pretty good game for the viewer all by itself.

I truly think that the USA Network is consistently putting out the best new programming around. This is a pleasant contrast to the Sci-Fi Network, which is doing its best to buy up and budget kill anything that threatens to be good sci-fi.

The three series from USA that we watch religiously (Psych, White Collar, and Burn Notice) is a larger count than the combined shows we watch from the original ""big 3"" .... combined.

2796053,4,B000OHZKZE,"Actual detective shows are kind of hard to find now -- let alone a funny, well-written detective series with a hilarious twist. That's where ""Psych"" comes on, on the heels of ""Monk."" While it could use a bit more ironing, this clever series does a good job blending comedy and mystery, and gives us some lovably fradulent guys to follow the adventures of.

Shawn Spencer (James Roday) was trained to be ultra-observant and intelligent by his strict, humorless father Henry (Corbin Bernsen), who wanted him to be a cop. And though he is determined never to be a cop (he doesn't even have a steady job), Shawn can glimpse clues and details that nobody else notices -- even the police.

But it backfires when he reports his observations to the police, and is arrested as a suspect. To save himself, Shawn pretends to be a psychic -- and the gimmick works so well that he decides to do it professionally. So he drags his very reluctant pal Gus (Dul&eacute; Hill) out of a boring job, and they end up regularly hired by the police chief, despite the skepticism of Carl Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), who doesn't buy their act.

And so they set out into a variety of cases: death at a spelling bee, a haunting at a sorority house, a wedding tainted by theft and murder, a ghostly stalking, a cat used as a witness, Civil war reenactments, a comic book convention (where they mess with George Takei's head), alien abductions, speed dating, underground poker, and organizing a surprise birthday party for Lassiter.

Most shows aren't really able to strike a balance between comedy and mystery, but ""Psych"" does. The mysteries are light and fun, and the people making it actually seem to be enjoying themselves -- no hardcore crimes, gore and grimness. That's what makes it so enjoyable.

The mysteries are well done, but each one has enough funny dialogue (""My name is Ichabod Fletchman, Sticky-Icky to my boys"") and kookiness to keep it from ever being dull. Between kooky mysteries -- usually with Shawn flailing around in his pseudo-mystical act -- we get to see what turned him into such a weirdo, and his current relationship with his sarcastic father.

There is a slight flaw, though -- a disproportionate number of the guilty parties seem to be pretty young women. Fortunately this starts lessening as the season goes on. The mysteries get progressively tighter, and the writing cleverer and funnier (""I'm never doing anything blindly with you again! I learned that at the Mexican border. Twice!"").

Roday is hilarious and brilliant -- charming, funny, likable, pleasant, and completely devoid of any dignity (""IIIIII hear a voice!""), with some great full-body acting. Shawn is one of those people who is half luck and half talent; no matter how outragous he gets, things somehow always work out.

Hill is equally great as his intelligent, responsible, geeky sidekick who tries to keep them out of serious trouble, while the crusty Timothy Omundson and tentative love interest Maggie Lawson round off the cast. Corbin Bernsen also makes regular appearances as Shawn's dad, who considers his son a walking freakshow.

""Psych's"" first season is a delightfully frothy mix of comedy and mystery, with solid scripting and likable characters. Definitely a good show to keep an eye on.",1291852800,,3275,4.897111913357401
2796054,5,B000OHZKZE,"Psych has some of the most clever, snappy dialogue on TV, also not afraid of good old fashioned slapstick comedy. James Roday and Dul Hill play so well off each other, kind of the Odd Couple for a new generation. Shawn is a free spirit and Gus is very practical, each as smart as a whip, but in different ways. The first couple of episodes set up most of the characters and story lines that remain with the show to this day (except for a rotating cast of young Shawns). There are so many dynamics but creator Steve Franks and crew make it work, and leave me wanting more. I love the episodes ""Shawn versus the Red Phantom"" and ""Scary Sherry: Bianca's Toast"". Shawn has very unconventional ways, but he always gets SBPD their bad guy (or girl).",1290643200,,743,4.391304347826087
2796055,5,B000OHZKZE,"Psych is unusual in that it starts very strong.  The characters are, at the start, fundamentally who they are later.  The creator clearly knew who these people were and nailed it at the start.

The banter between Shawn and Gus is brilliant.  The character of Shawn is the brilliant comedian with Gus, but yet can play straight man for the really crazy one episode characters he meets.  I can't think of anyone else able to play the comedian and straight man so well.

Season 2 might be the best season, but you have classics like Weekend Warriors (Murder during a Civil War re-enactment), 9 Lives (Gus is replaced by a cat) and Shawn vs The Red Phantom (Magic-Head!)

Psych starts out being a comedy first, the character interplay comes second and the crime third.

2796062,5,B000OHZKZE,"I have been a fan of psych for years, but until recently I never had owned season one. I had seen it when it originally aired but never again until now. I forgot how well the series started. It seemed like from the pilot they had this show figured out. They knew exactly what to do and no time was spent trying to find it's footing. It left the gates in full stride.

The actors from the start are hilarious and you will laugh a lot during this first season. I think that in many ways this is the best season of Psych. That is not meant as a complaint of future seasons but as a compliment to this one.  The other seasons are stellar but this one soars above them in charm and overall writing. The cases are more traditional this time around. They follow the more normal murders and do not stray into the weird and ridiculous like later seasons. It acts more like a procedural drama in that respect. That doesn't mean the comedy is subdued, far from it. Some of these episodes are downright gut busters as you have to control yourself in order to hear all the dialogue after an awesome joke.

Another thing that I like in this opening season is the better use of the flashbacks. In later seasons the connections to the flashbacks are forced. Not so in the first season as they seem to compliment instead of feed off of each other.

As for the dvd itself there are deleted scenes along with some audio commentaries. Nothing too special but they certainly add some sparkle to this set. There are fifteen episodes which is a great number compared to other traditional thirteen episode premiere season runs. This is a series that should be picked up by fans of procedural dramas. It is not a cut and dry procedural like most thanks to the comedy and great performances throughout by all of the cast. I am psyched for Psych you should be too.",1277942400,,1837,4.378299120234604
2796073,5,B000OHZKZE,"If you don't have Psych Season 1, then you must run, not walk to a place that sells it and buy it. Notice I didn't say, rent it, but buy it. Psych is a very funny and unique show.

For those of you who have no idea what the show is about, it's about a guy who has fantastic observational skills and claims to be a psychic. Shawn (the fake psychic) and his partner, Gus, solve crimes for the police.  Trust me, when I say this isn't your typical show. It's so gosh darn funny.  The comedic timing between Shawn and Gus with each other, and Shawn and Gus with the rest of the cast is amazing. The jokes come so fast, you'll miss some of them. I watch them over and over, and see jokes that I miss the first time I saw it.  It is that good, I can also promise you won't get tried of it.

There's a fantastic running gag. Each eppy has a pineapple somewhere in it. See if you can find it.  Sometimes it's really easy to see, and sometimes it's tricky to spot, but a pineapple is always there.

Another strong point in the series is that the start of the eppy, shows Shawn and Gus as kids, and it somehow relates to the eppy, it's fantastic.

The casting is top notch  for everyone.  All of the characters play well off each other, and each have their own traits.  This show is wonderfully written. The jokes are so funny, and you have to be quick, or you miss them.  Shawn and Gus are silly and goofy, but that just adds charm to the show.

Shawn and Gus also make reference to 80's movies, it's a hoot. That all goes back to strong writing.

If you like a perfect show, with great casting, snappy dialogue, great comedic timing and playing off each other, then this show is for you.

I can't really tell you what one eppy is better than another, b/c all of them are good. Every single one. I can't say enough good things about Psych.

If you start the Psych ride, you won't be sorry. I know I'm not. Easily the best show on TV",1276041600,,1923,4.101604278074866

2796080,3,B000OHZKZE,"There's a real chance that writing this will get me flamed by fans of the show, but it seems like a dissenting opinion is needed here, and I feel like the one to give it.

PSYCH, a program about a hyper-observant guy who solves crimes under the guise of a psychic detective, is a bad show.  It really is.  Let me count the ways.

CHARACTERS: The show is basically a live-action cartoon, with the lead character -- Shawn -- doing his best impersonation of Bugs Bunny.  Just like Bugs he takes virtually nothing serious, is unaccountably smug and vain, manipulates and takes advantage of everyone (including family and close friends), and never misses an opportunity to crack wise or engage in some melodramatic slap-stick.  He's supposed to be charming, but the guy is a complete and total jerk.  Shawn (begrudgingly) shares the screen with a hapless sidekick name Gus (a pharmaceutical rep who delivers every line the exact same way), a triumverate of easily duped detectives (one of whom is a lackadaisical police chief who lets Shawn get away with all sorts of tomfoolery, including fraud, evidence tampering, and breaking and entering), and his grumpy father (an ex-cop played with skill by Corbin Bernsen).

COMEDY: There are basically four types of jokes in the show.  1) Shawn gads about during one of his ""psychic episodes,"" flinging things around and being a nuisance.  2) Shawn makes a pop culture reference.  3) Shawn insults Gus, Lassiter (one of the detectives), his father or some random character who's wandered into his radar.  4) Shawn aggressively hits on an attractive woman.  Some of the wordplay is witty, but most of the comedic burden lies on Shawn mugging it up.

MYSTERY: None.  There ARE mysteries, of course, but they are just as cartoonish as the rest of the show, meaning that the end of each episode is more than a little reminiscent of Scooby-Doo.  Here's a fun game: count how many times the bad guys (or girls) give themselves away at the climax by revealing a detail they shouldn't know.

BACKGROUND: A gimmick of the show is that each episode starts with a moment from Shawn's childhood, which is then tied to whatever mystery he stumbles across that week.  This is actually decently done, as is Shawn's history with his father and (mostly absent) mother.

EVERYTHING ELSE: The love interest is forced and tiresome.  There's no element of credibility to anything that happens (which means there is also not one iota of tension or suspense to any of the episodes).  Even the theme song is bad enough to set my teeth on edge.

Sounds bad, yeah?  But here's the thing: I CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT.

Yes!  It's a bad show.  A bad, pointless, unfulfilling, highly addictive show.  It's like eating an entire family-sized bag of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheetos/dp/B000R7TE9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheetos</a>&nbsp;in one sitting.  You just consumed a ton of empty calories, most of it puffy, crunchy air, and you know that what you just did was in no way healthy or beneficial for you.  So why did you do it?  The cheese.  That neon dusting of cheese was enough to make the puff taste so good, you couldn't help but cram it down.

This show is a family-sized bag of Cheetos.  There is absolutely no reason to recommend this show or to watch it yourself.  There are meals of far greater quality, with far better ingredients, put together in a far more pleasing manner.  But, heck, sometimes you just what something cheesy that crunches.  So, those of you who love this show, I understand where you're coming from, although I think you should stop trying to describe the writing, characters, plots, or dialogue as anything short of wincingly bad.  This is, without question, a bad, bad, just really bad show.

Psych manages to fail in *both*.  The comedy is a childish, slap-stick type of humor which fails as comdy.  The ""observations"" made (and magnified) by the protagonist are too brief for the DVD viewer to absorb and think about.  All-in-all this series would probably be enjoyed by eight-year-olds and younger.  If you are older than that, don't waste your time on it.",1231459200,9,710,4.770491803278689
2796105,5,B000OHZKZE,"""Psych"" is one of the best new shows on any television network.  Created by Steve Franks, who is also an executive producer and a writer on the show, ""Psych"" is a one of a kind series that beautifully combines mystery, comedy, drama, and suspense.

Shawn Spencer (James Roday) is a young slacker, who has constantly bounced around from job to job.  But, he possesses an amazing gift, thanks to a childhood spent with his strict, humorless policeman father, Henry (Corbin Bernsen).  He has an amazing photographic memory and an uncanny ability for observing insignificant details.  One night after a date, he calls in a tip to the police and is brought in the next day for questioning by detectives Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) and Lucinda (Anne Dudek).  After Lassiter acussess Shawn of being involved in the high profile kidnapping case, he gets out of it by revealing himself to be a psychic.  Interim Cheif Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson) reluctantly brings in Shawn to investigate, having known his father during his time as a cop.  He brings in his reluctant best friend Gus (Dule Hill) to assist.  Shawn and Gus' success in solving the case sets up the rest of the show.  Shawn and Gus establish the Psych detective agency to consult with the police on difficult cases (usually homicides) as well as taking on other interesting clientele.  Detective Juliet O' Hara (Maggie Swanson) would replace Dudek's character for the remainder of the show after the pilot.

The rest of this groundbreaking first season beautifully illustrates the unique variety of cases Shawn and Gus would undertake.  Everything from underground poker, to a cat who witnesses a murder, to a murder at a civil war reinactment.  Every episode is another hilarious misadventure for this duo.

I highly reccomend ""Psych"".  It's a great TV series with everything one such series should have.  The stories are strong, the characters are all wonderful, the witty jokes just keep coming and coming, and the overall premise is like no other.  The '80s pop culture references are also great.  Its funny watching Shawn fake his psychic abilities.  Gus knows he is fake, but supports his effort.  Henry and Lassiter know he is a fraud, too, but learn to accept his gift as the series goes on.  O' Hara and Vick either are convinced or they choose not to acknowledge that he is not really psychic.  If you like ""Monk"", you'll probably appreciate this show for most of the same reasons.  For fans of the show, owning this 4-disc set is a must!  Here is a brief synopsis of each episode in this season:

1. The Pilot: The very first episode of the series.  Fake psychic Shawn Spencer and his best friend Burton ""Gus"" Guster are brought in by the Santa Barbra police department to investigate a high profile kidnapping.

2. Spellingg Bee: Shawn and Gus try to figure out why the Spellmaster at a local regional spelling bee was murdered.

3. Speake Now or Forever Hold Your Piece:  Shawn and Gus must crash a high society wedding in order to recover a cherished engagement ring.

4. Woman Seeking Dead Husband-Somkers Okay, No Pets: An attractive widow turns to the duo to find her missing husband.

5. 9 Lives: Shawn believes the cat of a recent murder victim will aid him in solving the crime.

6. Weekend Warriors:  Shawn and Gus undertake roles in a civil war reinactment to help Lassiter figure out who murdered one of the actors.

7. Who Ya Gonna Call?: The duo help a man who believes a ghost is trying to kill him.

8. Shawn vs. the Red Phantom: Shawn and Gus go to a local comic book convention to investigate the dissappearance of a teenager.

9. Forget Me Not:  Henry's former Captain, suffering from Alzheimer's, needs Shawn's help when he belives to have solved a recent homicide, but can't prove it.

10. From the Earth to Starbucks: After a drunken Lassiter admits to Shawn his doubts about the death of an astronomer or to ever solve a case again, Shawn is determined to prove Lassiter right and rebuild his confidence.

11. He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, He Loves Me, Oops He's Dead!:  Shawn and Gus' investigation of a naked man believed to have been abducted by aliens lands them into another strange universe-speed dating!

12. Cloudy...Chance of Murder: Shawn and Gus become legal consultants while investigating the mysterious murder of a popular TV weatherman and helping a down-on-his luck lawyer clear his client of the crime.

13. Game, Set...Muuurder?: Shawn constantly interferees with Gus' participation at a corporate retreat while investigating the dissappearnce of a tennis star.

14. Poker? I Barely Know Her: When a good friend of Henry's refuses to call the police after his son steals from him, he forces Henry to go to Shawn and Gus for help.

15. Scary Sherry: Bianca's Toast: in this exciting season finale, Shawn and Gus help detective O' Hara go undercover as a soroity sister as they investigate the murder of a young woman that parallels an old urban legend.",1230422400,,4958,4.794811320754717
2796106,5,B000OHZKZE,"I got excited for awhile when Psych was aired on NBC because i truthfully believe that if it were on a major network at prime time slot (not Fridays at 10 when a lot of the target audience may be out) it would be a huge hit.  The humor is smart, and you can watch these episodes over and over and still enjoy them.  I think I've watch some of the ones on this DVD over 20 times and I still laugh or at least smile every time I see it.  The DVD is completely worth it whether you've been watching since the beginning or are looking to catch up or are looking for a great show to get into.  For me it's my favorite show out there right now.  I would recommend this 100%.  Also season 2 is on DVD and it's also equally as amazing.  I would recommend watching season 1 first, however, because there are references in season 2 (as well in the new season) that only seasoned Psych watchers get, and they make the show a lot more entertaining when they bring back the ever popular pineapple, the fist pounds, or the ""hear about pluto? that's messed up.""",1225152000,,1046,4.148514851485149
2796107,4,B000OHZKZE,"I admit that I stumbled across this series completely by accident. The West Wing is one of my favourite series of all time. When I heard that Dule Hill was starring in Psych, I assumed it was a deadly serious psychological drama. I mean, that is the kind of thing brilliantly talented actors like Dule Hill act in, right?

Wrong.

Whereas other crime dramas are going the serious and dark route, Psych does a complete and total 180-degree turn and goes for the laughs instead. The series takes its time building up both its characters and the situation, but once it gets going it is addictively funny viewing.

James Roday is a charismatic lead actor. There's a little Jim Carrey-ishness in his Psychic slapstick, but he has his own innate charm that allows him to pull off some outrageous stuff. And Dule Hill, as always, does great work as the straight-man - never an easy role to play when your co-star is stealing the limelight. Fortunately, Dule deftly holds his own.

I was delightfully surprised, in these grimly serious times, to see that series as lighthearted and entertaining as this are still being produced. It's a beacon of light in a bleak television landscape.",1224374400,5,1176,4.75

I haven't listened to all of the commentary but there are some goodies you can find in each episode if you pay attention. For instance, watch episodes 6 and 8. In episode 9, there's something that combines those two eps. You just have to pay attention when they cut away from a scene. My favorite episode is ""Scary Sherry: Bianca's Toast"".

Rarely do you find a show with as new and fresh a premise as this one does. The crazy, laugh yourself silly humor that permeates each episode is incredible and thankfully doesn't sink to using poo jokes, sexual innuendos, etc, to get a laugh.
James Roday is Genius as Shawn Spencer the lead character, who spends his time teasing his best friend Gus (Dule Hill) and solving crimes anonymously, using his extreme attention to detail, taught to him by his cop father,  who is expertly played by Corbin Bernsen of LA Law fame. When the police one day suspect that he's been committing the un-lawful acts, he gets out of it by claiming to be psychic. When it actually works, no one is more surprised then Shawn himself! Now he has to keep the act going and use his ""powers"" to solve other cases assigned to him. This proves difficult at times, due to the skepticism of the head detective, Lasseter (Timothy Omundson) At the end of the pilot, Shawn and Gus decide to start their own detective agency, called Psych, and thus begins the series that is one in a million. The first season is packed with awesome extras and the second season (just released!) is even better. The commentaries are hilarious to listen to and the gag reel is sure to make you chuckle.

This wasn't the best show that I've ever watched, or even the funniest (sometimes it's hard to watch the main character go through his ""psychic"" routine of flopping around and making a fool of himself), but it's definitely a solid show. I like the pre-episode flash backs to his childhood that helps to explain how he is and how he reacts to different situations. The dynamic that he has with his father almost reminds me of Christopher Titus (the comedian) and his father, except Shaun (the main character) has a nicer dad.

If you're bored, like comedy, in between shows, or just looking for something that you can laugh at without thinking too hard, this just might be the show for you. Gus (his black friend) doesn't provide any kind of ghetto contrast if that's what you're looking for (he's actually much more a geek then Shaun), but every now and then he does remind Shaun that he's actually black. The dynamic of their friendship, Shaun's constant interest in any beautiful woman in a 10 mile radius, the random witticism, and his (Shaun's) father's feigned disappointment/last-ditch attempt to help/make his son grow up make this a fairly good show to watch.

The show is great, which means the DVDs are enjoyable regardless.  However, sans some great extras (there were a few bloopers and a few other unexciting extras like the international pilot), I took off a star.  I did really enjoy the audition reels, though.

I watched a few of the episodes with the commentary turned out, and boy, someone make James Roday take nap!  The man sounded a little tired and bored, throughout, and while it was still clear that he likes the show, it's pretty clear that Sean and James are not the same person.  Wow.

Looking for something new, I bought this series on a whim and absolutely loved it. It's different, has good well thought out mysteries with excellent character chemistry.

The main character is a slacker with a nearly photographic memory his father, a police officer, trained him in since he was a small child. Looking for something new in his life, the main character cons his best friend from childhood to run a detective agency in which he tries to pass himself off as a psychic since no one believes that he's just THAT good at solving mysteries.

2796141,5,B000OHZKZE,"I stumbled upon Psych back before the premiere in 2006.  I believe it was the summer and of course, nothing is on TV. Saw the ads for this, and after hearing the premise, I got curious. When the premiere rolled around, I was hooked.

Man, I love Shawn and Gus!  Without doing a total rehash of the plot: Shawn grew up with his cop father, Henry (Corbin Bernsen who is great in this) who taught him how to be observant of everything in a room. So while on a date, Shawn notices something on the tv and calls in a tip to the police. When he goes to the station to collect his reward, they threaten to arrest him b/c he knows too much about what happened. So to get himself out of trouble, he has a ""psychic episode."" And thus starts the hilarious journey.

The comedic timing of James and Dule' is fabulous.  You can tell that they are enjoying themselves. This also goes for the rest of the cast.  The humor is never overdone, and it's never vulgar which makes it great for family viewing. They're solving crimes, but it's never the same, stale story every episode.  The creators have also done a great job of casting little Shawn and Gus. Those boys are adorable!

The supporting cast compliments the leads very well. I've already mentioned Shawn's dad, Henry, but the two detectives, Lassiter (aka ""Lassie) and Juliet (""Jules"") are a treat to watch as well.

I love all of the pop culture references, and the poking fun at themselves. I love a show that can do that. It keeps them in touch w/the viewer...especially when the jokes are stuff that you've been thinking.

And who doesn't love the psychouts?!",1204761600,,1606,4.469178082191781

So, imagine my surprise when by the end of the second episode, my mom, dad, sister, and brother were all sitting in the family room watching it with me.  Believe me, that DOES NOT happen in our family.

  This show is fulled with laughter and I ended up watching the entire first season that night with my family.  I have already seen the episodes when they premiered on television, but I was still laughint at the funny parts.

2796151,4,B000OHZKZE,"I have been in love with ""Psyche"" since the first episode.  Not only is it incredibly funny but the plots are actually very mysterious and I would rate them right up there with serious shows like ""Law and Order"".  The chemistry between the actors (James Roday and Dule Hill) is amazing and I feel like I'm watching two guys who actually have hung around together since they were kids.

I'm a pop culture groupie and not since the ""Gilmore Girls"" have I caught so many inside pop culture references.  Believe me, you have to be on your toes but they are there throughout the show.  One episode when Shawn accuses Gus of having a crush on MBB (Meridith Baxter Birney) from ""Family Ties"", I was on the floor laughing.  Corbin Bernson is great as a  ""real"" retired cop who has wanted his kid to follow in his footsteps and has trained him since he was 5 years old even going as far as explaining the true rules of ""Hide and Seek"".  Because of the extensive training and a photographic memory, Shawn has found a way to convince the Police Department that he is a psychic. While his Dad doesn't really approve, he is just glad that his son is finally employed and he is on the department which has been his goal from the beginning.

The biggest surprise is the comic talents of Timothy Omundson who played such a straight arrow on ""Judging Amy"".  As Lassiter, the ""by the book""
Detective who wants to prove that Shawn is a fake, he is constantly outwitted by the psychic duo of Shawn and Gus.  He is also still heartbroken by his two year separation from his wife and is in denial that they are actually divorced.  The scene where he shoots her hummels in revenge is another great hilarious scene.

I also give credit to this show for having a female Police Chief (Kirstin Nelson) and a very intelligent junior female Detective (Maggie Lawson).  While most shows try to make a big deal out of this, it's just a matter of fact issue with ""Psyche"".  Both of these actresses are perfect for the show.

The writer's strike has been tough on everyone but I just read that NBC is going to run ""Psyche"" on Network TV starting March 2.  The people who are unfortunate enough not to have cable will finally get a glimpse of what they are missing.

2796158,4,B000OHZKZE,"Actual detective shows are kind of hard to find now -- let alone a funny, well-written detective series with a hilarious twist. That's where ""Psych"" comes on, on the heels of ""Monk."" While it could use a bit more ironing, this clever series does a good job blending comedy and mystery, and gives us some lovably fradulent guys to follow the adventures of.

Shawn Spencer (James Roday) was trained to be ultra-observant and intelligent by his strict, humorless father Henry (Corbin Bernsen), who wanted him to be a cop. And though he is determined never to be a cop (he doesn't even have a steady job), Shawn can glimpse clues and details that nobody else notices -- even the police.

But it backfires when he reports his observations to the police, and is arrested as a suspect. To save himself, Shawn pretends to be a psychic -- and the gimmick works so well that he decides to do it professionally. So he drags his very reluctant pal Gus (Dul&eacute; Hill) out of a boring job, and they end up regularly hired by the police chief, despite the skepticism of Carl Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), who doesn't buy their act.

And so they set out into a variety of cases: death at a spelling bee, a haunting at a sorority house, a wedding tainted by theft and murder, a ghostly stalking, a cat used as a witness, Civil war reenactments, a comic book convention (where they mess with George Takei's head), alien abductions, speed dating, underground poker, and organizing a surprise birthday party for Lassiter.

Most shows aren't really able to strike a balance between comedy and mystery, but ""Psych"" does. The mysteries are light and fun, and the people making it actually seem to be enjoying themselves -- no hardcore crimes, gore and grimness. That's what makes it so enjoyable.

The mysteries are well done, but each one has enough funny dialogue (""My name is Ichabod Fletchman, Sticky-Icky to my boys"") and kookiness to keep it from ever being dull. Between kooky mysteries -- usually with Shawn flailing around in his pseudo-mystical act -- we get to see what turned him into such a weirdo, and his current relationship with his sarcastic father.

There is a slight flaw, though -- a disproportionate number of the guilty parties seem to be pretty young women. Fortunately this starts lessening as the season goes on. The mysteries get progressively tighter, and the writing cleverer and funnier (""I'm never doing anything blindly with you again! I learned that at the Mexican border. Twice!"").

Roday is hilarious and brilliant -- charming, funny, likable, pleasant, and completely devoid of any dignity (""IIIIII hear a voice!""), with some great full-body acting. Shawn is one of those people who is half luck and half talent; no matter how outragous he gets, things somehow always work out.

Hill is equally great as his intelligent, responsible, geeky sidekick who tries to keep them out of serious trouble, while the crusty Timothy Omundson and tentative love interest Maggie Lawson round off the cast. Corbin Bernsen also makes regular appearances as Shawn's dad, who considers his son a walking freakshow.

""Psych's"" first season is a delightfully frothy mix of comedy and mystery, with solid scripting and likable characters. Definitely a good show to keep an eye on.",1199491200,,3275,4.897111913357401

Their chemistry is flawless, and I love how they weave in the slapstick physical stuff with all the pop-culture-laden references. And as if the show itself isn't funny enough, the DVD includes a blooper reel (can I just say, no DVD ever includes enough of this stuff!!), and also great behind-the-scenes insight and cast interviews.

There is a lot of adlibbing and improv in the filming of the show which allows for some hilarious one-liners. Psych can be absurd and juvenile, but it is entertaining and generally wholesome enough that I could recommend it to my pretty conservative parents who find most of the humor on TV today to be offensive.  I think all of the characters are very likeable.  If you liked Dule Hill on West Wing, you'll enjoy seeing him in this different role.  It's also nice to watch a ""crime"" show that isn't gruesome and disturbing.  Psych is always fun, never serious.

This movie is almost funny. However, I found that many of the humor was a bit 'forced' into the plot. There is no slap-stick nor cheap stupid humor, though. Only that I found that many scenes do not have good transitions to the next ones.

Another drawback is the characters. First-of-all, the character about a not-so-smart policeman who is annoying and considered 'worthless', is so last millenium. I have seen too many series where the detective outside the force is described as smarter than the ones in the force that seeing another one is just a-thousand-too-many. The writers need to be more creative with this. I am sure that detective movies can still be funny and fun to watch without having a 'bullied' character in it. I mean, forcing such a character into the movie is so 80's.

The dynamics between ""Gus"" and the fake detective was fun to watch though the actor of ""Gus"" doesn't really live up to my expectation of a 'necessary balance' to the immature live-for-the-moment fake detective.

The theatrical thriller is way better than the actual series.",1193616000,2,1302,4.747787610619469

Shawn does have an uncanny skill for observing detail, which he ends up using to convince the Santa Barbara police force that he is a psychic when he solves crimes the police can't.

Along with his reluctant childhood friend Gus (Dul Hill), Shawn solves case after case.  Roday's antics are hilarious, and he's really a funny character.  Gus is a perfect straight guy alongside Shawn.

But the chemistry between the actors is almost flawless.  Gus's deadpan reactions to the antics and Lassiter's reluctance to even be in the same room with the duo both make for great viewing.  It still cracks me up almost every time Shawn calls him Lassie even though it shouldn't.  Somehow, it just never crosses the line into silly.

There are pop culture references sprinkled throughout (mostly from the 80s) that might even spark some nostalgia.  I highly recommend watching this one.

The temptation to watch the extra features was too great to resist, so I watched them after the pilot episode (the order they're on disc #1) and now wish I hadn't-- it ruined some of the punchlines.

The plots of each episode are almost overshadowed by the sheer fact that you just want to see these actors talk and bicker and be goofy.

2796182,5,B000OHZKZE,"Okay, other reviews have explained the premise, so I won't re-hash that.  Some of the things that impress me the most about this show is the level of quality, and that it is consistently entertaining.  Sadly, as a Monk viewer, I cannot say that the past couple of seasons of that show have been of a consistent high quality - some have been downright painful to watch, for which I blame different writers and directing.  Hopefully PYSCH will be able to maintain its quality of writing, acting, and directing.  The cast of PSYCH is superb - beyond the two leads, we have an excellent supporting cast, plus Corbin Bernson just lends something to the show that just seems to take it up a notch on the grin-factor scale.  The writing is SO good - rarely do I watch even good episodes of MONK twice, but with PSYCH, I actually enjoy watching episodes through multiple times, and will share scenes with friends (eg. the cat in the car with Gus).  The show doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is, but what it is, is a sharp, witty, snappily-paced crime mystery show.  Other than watching my Yankees baseball, it is presently the only show on television that I very much look forward to every week, and will actually plan around.  I hope that you will find it enjoyable, too.",1184371200,57,1275,4.537117903930131
2796183,5,B000OHZKZE,"Shawn Spencer (James Roday) is a loser.  He's drifted from job to job ever since graduating from high school.  The one thing he absolutely knows he doesn't want to do is become a cop.  That's what his dad (Corbin Bernsen) has been training him to do since he was a little kid.  Growing up, he learned how to observe every little detail at a glance.

Even though Shawn has no desire to be a cop, he can't stop himself from calling in tips to the local police based on news reports he sees.  After one such tip, he finds himself under suspicion for knowing too much.  He quickly talks his way out of it by pretending to be a psychic.  In fact, he's so convincing, Chief Vick (Kirsten Nelson) hires him on a part time basis to help with difficult cases.

Shawn is usually teamed up with Detectives Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) and O'Hara (Maggie Lawson).  Lassiter doesn't believe a word Shawn says and usually tries to trip him up.  O'Hara is skeptical but can't deny what she sees Shawn pull off time after time.

Also along for the ride is Shawn's best friend Gus (Dule Hill).  Gus is reluctant to get involved in the cases, but Shawn drags him in anyway.  And the two have to deal with plenty of exciting cases.  There's a heir who is kidnapped, murders at a spelling bee and a comic convention, dastardly deeds at a high society wedding, and an urban legend that may be repeating itself.

This show is a blend of comedy and mystery.  It airs right after Monk on USA, and is a perfect fit.  While that show is often melancholy, this one is high energy.  In fact, sometimes, it's a bit too over the top.  But most of the time it's fun.

As with many shows, it took a little while to hit its stride.  The first few mysteries are rather weak and the focus is on Shawn doing his fake psychic thing.  When the show returned from hiatus with ""Forget Me Not,"" (easily my favorite of the season) it found the right balance.  The show is still hilarious but the mysteries are much tighter.

And the comedy has something for everyone.  It's got fast, witty dialog, absurd situations, and full body slapstick.

The DVD set is packed with lots of extras.  There are plenty of deleted scenes and one or two commentaries per disc.  The first disc contains two versions of the pilot, behind the scenes segments, and some hilarious bloopers.  My only real complaint with the set is the lack of episode descriptions.  The titles are given, but they don't always trigger my memory as to what the episode itself is about.

The show took a while to find its footing.  But once it did, it became lots of fun.",1183334400,65,2587,4.413135593220339
2796184,5,B000OHZKZE,"Despite the fact that I don't have cable (I know, I know), I was able to catch two episodes of Psych on the USA network. Finally, after what seemed like years, the first season arrived on DVD, and I rushed to the store to buy it.

Even after seeing just two episodes, this show completely lived up to what I thought it was. Funny, quirky, heartfelt, and FUN, Psych is a one-of-a-kind show. I love the comic duo of Shawn and Gus, and everytime I watch the show I find more things to enjoy about it. Even the special features - a hilarious gag reel, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and a peek inside the writer's room - are lots of fun to watch.

Please do yourself (and your friends, your neighbors, and the guy that mows your lawn) a favor and BUY this show.

It was a spoof on horror movies and Dule Hill waving his belt around did me in!  This is the first time I have ever bought a TV show season on video.  I usually just get them from my local library.

2796187,5,B000OHZKZE,"When Psych started advertising the first season in July of 2006, I'll admit I had my dobts.

I wasn't even going to watch the show which premired after the 1st episode of Monk's 5th season.

But I am so glad i decided to watch the premire. Even after the first episodes, I wasn't sure it could live up to all the hype and the reputation of ""Monk"". As the season progressed it was obvious that this was a genuine TV show. Each episode is very similar yet, never quite the same. Every episode starts off with a flashback of Shawn's childhood which ties in to Shawn's current predicament.

The characters are very well casted and there is never an episode that goes by that doesn't make me laugh. The show combines the usual dective/mystery aspect with a bit of comedy which makes the show PERFECT.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of ""Monk"". Great show can't wait for more episodes to come.",1181520000,12,1107,5.038251366120218

In a world (Our real world) where it's hard to find TV shows with a shred of quality Psych has lots of it and it's original. He is exactly what the show says he is. Shawn Spencer in a fake psychic detective. And when you watch the show it's absolutely hilariousness when he pretends to have a psychic vision. It's a comedy, not a serious show. So when he is having a psychic vision all the right people believe he's telling the truth. But he actually has a photo graphic memory. His Dad knows the secret, his partner can't believe they keep getting away with it and the real detective knows he's a fake he just can't prove it and Shawn keeps on solving the cases.

It's a great show. At least rent it if you don't buy it.",1178928000,6,824,4.182389937106918
2796190,5,B000OHZKZE,"In a world where most of the new tv crime dramas are gory ""how-done-it's"" that strive to be ""serious"", Psych, like Monk before it, is a breath of fresh air to say the least.

Psych tells the story of Shawn Spencer, the tv's first ""fake psychic detective"", who has been trained relentlessly by his snarky, sarcastic cop father, Henry, to notice even the most minute of details. He's so good at it, in fact, he can solve police cases from watching the evening news for two minutes. That's about as close as he's willing to get to a badge, though; Henry might have liked nothing more than to see his son follow in his footsteps, but Shawn wants nothing less. But his fun hobby soon becomes his even more absurd reality when he is brought in for questioning about just how he knew what he did about a electronic store robbery. Instead of attempting to explain to annoyed police officers who don't want to hear about how some thirty year old slacker who can't even hold a steady job can do theirs better than they can, Shawn does what he does best: he lies and tells them he's a psychic. But before he can get out the door of the station to gloat, he is asked to help Santa Barbara's finest find a millionaire's missing son.

Enter Burton ""Gus"" Guster, Shawn's best friend and lifelong partner in crime, who is a sucessful pharmaceuticals representitive and wants no part in Shawn's scheme. Too bad he can't say no to his best bud (and only friend outside of work).

After solving the missing millionaire-turned-murder case, Shawn decides that he has finally found his calling and opens Psych, his new pet project.

The guys proceed to have all sorts of absurd adventures, from a missing wedding ring, a murderous cheater at the National Spelling bee and a lost loot from a robbery, to a murder on the field of a Civil War reinactment, a speed dating caper and a haunted sorority house. Every episode is chock full of one liners that put Dane Cook to shame, and the situations our boys find themselves in are hilarious.

Psych's characters are what makes what might otherwise have been a ratings bomb into the electric boogaloo that it is (see the psych webpage for the reference). While most of the time Shawn behaves like an twelve-year-old, he has his moments of adult insight, and there's even some angsty bits in there too, especially when it comes to his relationship with his father. As for he and Gus, despite the fact that they are total and complete opposites (Gus is responsible, organized and enjoys spelling bees and the history channel; Shawn takes the saying ""by the seat of your pants"" to a whole new level, can't be bothered with little things like responsiblity and ethics, and prefers sports), they still manage to be best buddies, no matter how much Shawn annoys Gus. Carlton Lassiter (affectionately known as ""lassie"" by Shawn and a legion of fans) is even more of a contrast with Shawn as the skeptical dectetive who can't stand their new consultant's antics, and his new partner (as of the second episode) Juiliet O'Hara is perhaps the calming influence, though Shawn clearly has a thing for the new junior dectective. Cheif Karen Vick and Shawn's dad round out the main cast, though Psych's army of supporting characters have their moments as well.

And while all of the actors on the show are great in their respective roles, James Roday is the shining star. He's certainly one of the funniest actors I've seen in a long time (keep an eye out for him in Dukes of Hazzard and Beerfest too).

The show is also good to it's fans, with plenty of fun stuff on the website to check out (not to mention Shawn and Gus's myspace profiles). I would expect nothing less from the DVDs.

If you're not already down with Psych, I would definately remcommend you check it out!",1178064000,5,3781,4.607726597325408
2796191,5,B000OHZKZE,"What catches me off-guard with this show is that Shawn really could easily be snotty or bratty, especially in his interactions with Gus. Everything in his life goes right-- he can smooth-talk his way out of any situation, people like him, and besides his questionable psychic abilities, they think he's decent, and he's clever and witty. And yet none of this ever goes to his head. Instead, he approaches everything with charm and humor, and his excitement about cases  and such reminds me of an 8-yr-old going to his first monster-truck rally.

Shawn and Gus are so genuine that it really warms your heart to watch them. Their banter is funny, their friendship is real, and Shawn's sense of humor comes from left field sometimes, completely unexpected and hilarious.

All in all, it's the most original show that I've seen, and I absolutely love it.",1177632000,5,850,4.848275862068966

The interatction between Shawn and Gus is fanastic.  So quick witted, they remind me of some of the later seasons of Buffy.  The premise is great--a fake psychic detective.  Shawn is completely shameless in his antics and the crimes are fun.  My favorite is the season finale Scary Sherry.  In this episode, Shawn and Gus come upon one of their childhood tramas the death of mental patient Sherry.  They saw Sherry jump to her death and later investigate a crime in the same location.  Their childhood fears haunt them each step of the way to a surprising conclusion.  Its great!",1177372800,,707,4.620967741935484

8184992,2,B000OHZKZE,"Pretty lazy writing. Everything and everyone acts as a prop for the ridiculously privileged Shawn Spencer, who does whatever he wants without consequence or concern for the feelings of his ""friends"" and colleagues. The entire show is superficial and sexist...the female detective is constantly undermined and treated like an incompetent child. In fact, almost every female character in Psych is treated as a love interest or sex object. Gus, Shawn's supposed best friend and the only prominent person of color in the show, is also a mere husk of a character and adds no real value to the plot line. Shawn's father is the definition of toxic masculinity. He refuses to even tell his son ""I love you"" because it's not manly (gag). Do yourself a favor: watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
