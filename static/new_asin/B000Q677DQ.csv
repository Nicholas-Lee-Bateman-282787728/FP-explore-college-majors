8194268,4,B000Q677DQ,"This dvd title is a 2 disc set with the first being a 3+ hour interview with New Jack. The second disc has 5 matches, including the XPW freefall match with Grimes. It also has a featurette where the crew go to South Central with New Jack. About 90 minutes of matches and 90 minutes for the featurette, so there is plenty here.

If you have seen other shoot videos of New Jack, this one is by far the worst of the bunch. The interview is not focused on any particular area and they allow New Jack to ramble about most anything that comes to mind. He talks very little about ECW or any of the boys. He doesn't really talk bad about anyone and has chosen not to ""bury"" anyone on this dvd, which sucks since that's what most of us like about him.

On the plus side, New Jack is funny and jokes around a lot. I just like when he talks about the business a lot more. The Mike Moody dvd was probably the best of the shoot videos he did and should be checked out. This one does not live up to the hype. I expected it to be awesome. New Jack is older and more mellow these days. He is running a wrestling school in Virginia and has pretty much gotten on good terms with his old enemies, including Paul E., which is shocking.

Overall, this dvd is pretty okay due to the amount of actual footage you get. It is like spending a day with the guy and seeing what he's like. Jack has a lot of personality and he's always fun to watch just to see what he will do next. The information concerning the 2004 stabbing and Mass Transit are not really explained for those who are not familiar with his history, so this might not be a good dvd for someone who has not seen some of his other shoot videos. If you've already seen some of the other dvds, this is a nice addition to your collection.",1191715200,,1773,4.1037463976945245
