2069843,5,B00029NKS8,"I have been a fan of Rex Stout for a long, long time.  One reason I often dislike seeing books made into movies, or at least feel the movie pales when compared to the books, because often people see things differently.  So when a beloved set of characters such as Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin is brought to film, I automatically cringe, because I am rarely pleased with the results.  They tried in the late 70's with Thayer David playing Wolfe and Tom Mason as Archie.  Excellent casting, but was a little late.  Thayer David, a Sydney Greenstreet type actor, was perfect casting for Wolfe - the 1/7 of a ton genius detective that detects while never leaving him home.  Only David was already ill, dying of cancer, so the weight loss and lacking of strength sadly hurt his performance.  Later it was redone with William Conrad as Wolfe and too sexy Lee Horsely as Archie.  Sorry, the series had Wolfe pacing when expounding to suspects and sitting on the corner of his desk.  It made you wonder if the writers ever read Stout's books.  So, when

Timothy Hutton stepped into Archie's shoes I had mixed reservations.  I love Hutton, son of the brilliant Jim Hutton.  While you see a lot of his daddy in him, he is definitely his own man, and cuts a smart style when fleshing out his roles.

So I thought, okay, he would make a good Archie.  Then I wondered what about Wolfe?  They cast Maury Chaykin. Brilliant!  Wow, someone actually loved the books enough to follow them.

A&E is to be commended in letting Hutton run with the series for two seasons.  They are to be CONDEMNED for canceling it because they deemed it too expensive to make.  Shame on them!  The series was a class act all the way.  A delightful ensemble cast who changed roles episode to episode gave it a theatre feel.

The costuming is great, the acting divine and the stories - well, I actually KNEW what book they were based on!  It was HEAVEN.

So A&E I thank you for putting out these wonderful episodes so we Archie Addicts can enjoy them again.  And go take a flying leap for canceling what is nirvana in detective land.",1090886400,154,2095,4.476190476190476
2069844,5,B00029NKS8,"Since he first appeared on the scene in the 1940?s, Rex Stout?s corpulent detective, Nero Wolfe, with his fast-talking assistant/legman Archie Goodwin, have entertained mystery fans for generations.  A true ?armchair detective,? Wolfe usually sits in his New York brownstone enjoying his gourmet food and orchids, while Goodwin gathers the vital clues needed to solve the mystery at hand.  Attempts have been made to present Wolfe on TV and film with limited success, including 2 minor movies in the 40?s and a TV series starring William Conrad (TV?s Cannon) that lasted only half a season.  This handsome series, produced by the A&E Network in 2001, is the best rendition to date.  Maury Chaykin plays the cantankerous Wolfe, while Timothy Hutton plays the affable Goodwin. This set is the complete first season of the A&E series.

Probably one of the joys of the Wolfe series is the fact that, while both men are solid enough detectives on their own, it is their unique chemistry that allows them to tie up the case.  Without Goodwin, Wolfe would never get the vital information needed.  On the other hand, Goodwin doesn?t have Wolfe?s genius in completing the overall picture.  In many ways, their bickering and bantering is reminiscent of an old married couple.  Chaykin is perfect as the overbearing title character.  He does a wonderful job conveying Wolfe?s quirks and ego.  He is ably matched by Timothy Hutton?s wise-cracking sidekick.  Hutton (who also served as executive producer and one of the directors for the series) does a wonderful job with the snappy style that these sort of things need to have.

Set in the late 40?s, this production boasts wonderful production values, excellent scripts and a wonderful cast.  In fact, one of the more interesting aspects of the series is the use of ?recurring? players in the various episodes.  For example, one actress could appear as a blonde murder victim in one story, only to turn up as a brunette femme fatale in another.  It takes some getting used to, but it is effective and the performances are consistant as a result.  Colin Fox, who plays Wolfe?s put-upon major-domo/chef Fritz, is especially wonderful with his dry performance, while Kari Matchett is wonderful in a series of roles.  Bill Smitrovich is a hoot as Wolfe?s antagonist, the cranky Inspector Cramer.

For people new to the Wolfe stories, this series is an excellent introduction to them.  For mystery fans, this show definitely warrants at least a viewing, if not inclusion into your collection.  As a result, this is one set that I highly recommend!!!",1090368000,34,2583,4.988317757009346
2069845,5,B00029NKS8,If you like the books you will enjoy watching this series.  Entertaining and faithful Rex Stout's unique writting style.  I just wish A&E had continued adapting the books to film,1089936000,29,178,4.9
2069846,2,B00029NKS8,"Most television adaptations of iconic mystery sleuths are faithful to the source material but the casting is usually the problem, but it is the opposite here--Chaykin and Hutton are well cast and the basic mystery plot is followed but, and I'll blame all the following to Hutton, as from the credits, he seems to be the creative impetus behind this series, there are some issues I have which outweigh any positives--for one, the decision was made to use a static cast of actors (i.e.: James Tolkin) who change characters every episode, like some sort of theater rep company--you may see an occasional guest star, such as Carrie Fisher, but due to this constant acting ""troupe"", the effect is intrusive and not a little pretentious--another problem is altho I have said the main roles are well-cast, the portrayals are not well-done--the forces behind the series have seemed to forgotten that Wolfe was well-travelled and schooled in life (and skinny!) before settling down to a sedentary life--as one of the Amazon reviews describes him in this portrayal, ""a man-child""--a ""BOY-MAN?!"" Granted, making a portrayal based on the books/stories is difficult at best, but Chaykin has either been coached or on his own decided to play Wolfe as some sort of petulant innocent with an overinflated ego, brain and waistline, while sacrificing his knowledge of the outside world and the vagaries of man as seen in the writings--therefore, this leaves plenty of acting room for Hutton's Goodwin to belittle (vice badger) and humiliate (vice needle) Chaykin's Wolfe constantly through the series--for these reasons alone I cannot recommend this series as definitive adaptations but will label it as a noble failure and still await the next and, I hope, more successful effort.
Oh, and if the above wasn't enough, Inspector Cramer would NEVER man-handle Wolfe the way he does at the end of the conclusion of ""Motherhunt""--I was still debating buying this set even after considering all the aforementioned until I saw THAT which was the last straw...",1089504000,7,2035,5.095808383233533
2069847,5,B00029NKS8,"Unlike the other reviewers, before seeing any of these movies I had read all of the Rex Stout Nero Wolfe stories and books.  I can tell you, for example, that Cramer does indeed light his cigar in the office, in two of the earlier novels.
I half-expected to be disappointed, but I was more than overjoyed at these movies.  ""Eeny Meeny Murder Moe"" is very good. ""Over My Dead Body"" is very enjoyable.  The cream of the crop is ""Prisoner's Base"", which is excellent.
If you're a Nero Wolfe fan, don't hesitate.  You won't regret it.  Series 2 is out, too!",1089158400,22,553,4.435643564356436
2069848,4,B00029NKS8,"This series was a joy to watch.  Well written, well executed and infused with the spirit of the books.  Like one of the other reviewers, I was hooked on the books (also wonderful) after seeing the series.
Nero Wolfe is unique (to my experience, anyway) in that the big brained, Holmesian dectective isn't really the main character, certainly isn't the main voice, and neither wants, nor expects, to be liked.  Instead, Archie Goodwin, the snappy dressing, wise cracking legman, is the true protaganist.  As one author put it, ""These aren't Nero Wolfe mysteries -- they're Archie Goodwin mysteries!""
And this truly rich chemistry, which makes the books so wonderful, really comes out in the series.  You get to wander the 1940s (and 50s and 60s) streets with Archie, savoring the snappy fashions and even snappier patter as he gumshoes his way deep into the plot.  Then you get to follow him home to the brownstone and be as annoyed by Nero's arrogance and petty habits as he is.  But it always takes both of them, incredibly brilliant in their own unique way, to solve the insolvable.
One note about the actors performances, however: the performances are wonderful, especially those of the lead characters, but the actors performing secondary roles do show up in other episodes, usually playing someone new.  After I got used to it, I thought it was brilliant -- it's like watching a small theatre group performing a new play each week.  If I were an actor, I coudn't imagine a tv role that could possibly be more fun.  But I freely admit trying to keep track of the characters really threw me for a loop at first.
On the whole -- wonderful.  If you love cozies and locked room mysteries, you'll love this.  If you love Sherlock Holmes and unsolvable puzzles, you'll love this.  And if you love hard boiled 1940s detectives, you'll probably love this, too.  Hell, if you're just one of those rare people who like entertaining and well paced dialogue, and maybe even a bit of a plot, you'll probably love this. The lack of extras on the DVD is the only thing holding me back from five stars.  And I'd like to take all the stars away from A&E for letting such a creative and entertaining show waste away.",1087516800,34,2202,4.668393782383419
2069849,4,B00029NKS8,"One of the smartest and wittiest shows on television.  Based on the novels of the late Rex Stout, the Nero Wolfe mysteries that ran for two seasons on A&E are simply tremendous.  Usually, I read a book, and then critique the movie or TV adaption of it.  In this case, watching the show caused me to read the books!  The screenwriters did a remarkable job of keeping the essence, tone and feel of the books, while making adapting it for television.  Much of the dialogue is directly quoted from the novel (or novelette) that the episode is based on.
The genius of Rex Stout's work is that he combined the classic American hardboiled private eye (Mike Hammer, Sam Spade) with the intellectual British style of sleuth (Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, Poirot).  Bringing these characters of Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe to the small screen was a labor of love for Timothy Hutton, and I for one am thankful for his work.  The repertory style group of guest stars was another unique aspect to this series, where the same group of guest actors would play different characters each week, sometimes villians and sometimes victims.  The quality of acting is top notch.  The banter between Wolfe and Archie is a real treat to watch, and Hutton's version of Archie is so convincing, that I hear his voice when I read Stout's novels.
A word to parents, this is intelligent, well-written drama/adventure that the whole family can enjoy.  The ""curses"" of choice are ""Nuts!"" and ""Flummery!"" - nothing worse.  While there are murders, we do not see the murders happen, and there is no gore seen.  Also, despite Archie being a ladies man, there is no overt sexuality.  Sadly, as with many 'failed' shows today, it was probably too intelligent for the average viewer used to equating 'shock value' and 'crassness' with entertainment.  But to anyone looking for something more, something that aims higher and brings the viewer up rather than down with it, this is for you!
The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the lack of any extras on the DVD.  A&E continues to give this fine series short shrift to their shame.  Get this any way you can!",1086566400,41,2137,4.689008042895442
2069850,5,B00029NKS8,"Rex Stout's novels and novellas have finally sprung to life, and here are eight of the finest for us to enjoy, perfectly cast, acted, and directed.
Nero Wolfe (Maury Chaykin) has often been called the American Sherlock Holmes, though he actually takes after Sherlock's older brother, Mycroft.  Wolfe is an enormous sedentary genius with a penchant for fine food, orchids, and books (in that order), and a distaste for work.  He loves his routine, and never leaves his Manhattan townhouse on business if he can help it.  To help with the food, he employs a Swiss gourmet chef, Fritz Brenner (Colin Fox).  To help with the business, he employs Archie Goodwin (Timothy Hutton).
Archie, the narrator of both Stout's books and the series, is Wolfe's complement and factotum.  A licensed private detective himself, he not only does all the legwork (often assisted by freelance operatives Saul Panzer (Conrad Dunn), Fred Durkin (Fulvio Cecere), and Orrie Cather (Trent McMullen)), but also badgers Wolfe into doing his ""genius"" part.  Suave, cute, witty, charming, ebullient, confident, and very attractive, Archie takes more after Sherlock:  He loves to work.  (Though of course, he also knows how to play.)
This series is truly a delight.  Each episode stands on its own as an entertaining, exquisite work of art.  The attention to detail is remarkable.  Each frame is a painting; each line is music to my ears (and many are quotable).  The actual music (ranging from Jazz to Classical) always fits the setting, and is expertly recorded under the direction of Michael Small.
The actors above (and Bill Smitrovich as Inspector Cramer and R.D. Reid as Sgt. Purley Stebbins both of Manhattan Homicide) fit their characters the way Jeremy Brett fit Sherlock Holmes.  It's a pleasure to spend time with them.
The world of ""Nero Wolfe"" is wonderful, and well worth revisiting time and again.  And these DVDs are just the way to do it.  If you can afford them, you're in for a treat.  If you can't, beg, borrow, or steal.  They're that good.",1086134400,33,2029,4.938053097345133
2069851,4,B00029NKS8,"It's easy to see why this show lasted just two seasons... the production values are so high that each episode must have cost a fortune, A&E featured it on Sunday's--always a tough night for prime time--and it simply wasn't advertised adequately.  Outside the regular A&E audience no one had even heard of this show, much less been educated in how great Nero Wolfe really is.
If you watch Monk I would guess you'd like this show as well.  Both take serious situations--murders--and allow colorful, interesting characters do the investigating, totally escaping the redundant and melodramatic ""ripped from the headlines"" mysteries depicted in countless derivative programs on even the most prominant networks.  Oh, and those twists you like so much if you watch Law and Order or the Practice... Nero Wolfe often has those as well, better ones even.
Nero Wolfe, like Monk, is classy television.  Every frame shot and every word spoken oozes with creativity, and the result is a fun, light-hearted, and intelligent murder mystery every time.  In short, its about a shut-in, obese, extremely proud, and utterly brilliant private detective (Nero Wolfe, played by Maury Chaykin), and his clever, resourceful, and oddly loyal leg man Archie Goodwin (Timothy Hutton), and their combined effort to solve murder mysteries for a fee (Wolfe is well off, and it's easy to see why).  I say oddly loyal because frankly they have almost nothing in commmon.  For instance: Nero hates women, he barely tolerates them, but Archie is the quintessential ladies-man.  Nevertheless, the relationship between them is very special, and their exchanges are priceless.  Such an accomplishment is a credit to the writers and performers.  Making that relationship work--every episode, mind you--was a formidable task.  Wolfe will explode when something obstructs his routine, and Archie (who narrates each episode and is probably more the star of Nero Wolfe than Wolfe himself) provides consistantly amusing commentary on Wolfe's behavior.  Wolfe is a fascinating character.  He's very particular about everything--not schizophrenic like Monk, just picky--and any Nero Wolfe review would be remiss without a mention of his love for fine cuisine and orchids, two things that sometimes force him to overcome his nature and actually leave his home ""the brownstone""--he wears a cape and a tri-cornered hat whenever he does.  The rest of the time, Wolfe lets Archie conduct initial investigations and eventually bring in the suspects and the police for his questioning as Nero usually solves the case in his office with the entire cast waiting for him to point the finger, again like Monk.
The acting is superb across the board.  One unique and quite welcome aspect of the show is the recycling of actors.  I don't watch all that much TV, but I can't recall seeing a show where every episode featured the same supporting cast playing different parts to accomodate the plot.  There are around a dozen talented actors and actresses who play different characters in every episode, with just a handful of recurring parts.  This is smart, I think, because when you have a talented group assembled, the acting is consistantly good.  These people can play all sorts of roles, once you watch the show just watch the woman on the front cover of the DVD and you'll know what I mean.  She can play a sexy moviestar in one episode and a grumpy, somber, and rather plain slavic woman in another.
Nero Wolfe is all class, from the acting to the remarkable production design.  Set anywhere in the forties, fifties, and sixties (there is no chronological timeline linking the first episode to the second), everything feels right, and rich with New York culture and the nifty lingo of the period so competently wielded by Archie Goodwin.
This would easily merit five stars if there had been any extra features at all, but as a DVD this is not that spectacular.  Picture quality is adequate, but frankly the set design deserved better.  The features include the absolute bare minimum, with text bios of Hutton and Chaykin.
The Second Season is now coming out on DVD, I will be buying it as soon as I can.  Notice I didn't sum up the plot of a single episode, and frankly I don't need to.  The production quality and the basic premiss already described is by itself reason to watch the show.  From episode to episode interesting things occur.  These are not quite as unique as in every Monk episode, but they are still good starting points to get the plot moving and allow the other more than exemplary qualities of the production to shine.",1085616000,25,4585,4.975098296199214

2069882,5,B00029NKS8,"I have loved the Nero Wolfe mysteries for over 50 yrs. Hutton is far from my favorite actor, but he is an entertaining Archie Goodwin along with a talented ensemble group. Maury Chaykin is not quite in tune with Nero Wolfe - a little too much irascibility and not enough panache (Rex Stout definitely wrote Wolfe as someone with panache; Wolfe's favorite description of himself came when a former client described him as ""insufferably blithe"").

Still, the two men play off one another well enough, with Bill Smitrovich snarling on cue as the frustrated Inspector Cramer. The delights of seeing some of my favorite mysteries come to TV life, complete with stylish 1940's clothes and witty dialogue, makes this one of my most prized DVDs.",1443571200,,737,4.896

2069923,5,B00029NKS8,"I have to confess. The only Rex Stout Nero Wolf novel I ever read was published in the Saturday Evening Post when I was about 12 and was just starting to read a lot of adult fiction. I did not get reacquainted until some years ago when we got into a habit of watching every crime/mystery DVD TV series available from the Ramsey County public library system in suburban St. Paul, MN. We really liked the A&E TV series, especially Tim Hutton's version of Archie. I thought the novels were ideal for TV production of Nero Wolf's tight little world and his rigid life style juxtaposed against his nearly unlimited intellect and imagination. Why am I writing this review? We were fortunate to be in the right place at the right time to attend the first and only stage play adaptation of the Nero Wolf mystery, THE RED BOX at the Park Square Theater in Saint Paul, MN. just last week. The production is the only such so far authorized by the family of Rex Stout. Using a veteran director and a cast of experienced Twin Cities actors the play hit all the right notes for me, especially Archie, who serves as a sort of narrator. Therefore, I will be purchasing the DVDs from Amazon since they are long gone from the library. I really need to watch them again.",1402876800,,1251,4.443478260869565

Wolfe and Archie pout and spar in the spirit that Stout intended. This was especially good for me in order to visualize Wolfe, who will resemble Maury Chaykin for me now. Fritz takes on a more centralized role, and his relationship with Wolfe is honed in this series, (although Theodore is missing.) Saul Panzer is portrayed well by a couple of the supporting cast members, and Lon Cohen is as subtle and cynical as you would wish a New York reporter to be.  Lily Rowan and Lucy Valdon are well-represented. The gang, basically, is all there. But for those of us who long for an intelligent, funny man who truly likes women, aspires to marriage, loves helping people, holds his own in a street fight, plays pinochle as well as he plays poker, enjoys poetry, and also dances, well, thanks, Timothy Hutton, you have made our day.

2069969,5,B00029NKS8,"I very rarely write reviews, but I had to make an exception for this.

I had never heard of the Nero Wolfe series before one lunchtime my husband happened to catch a showing of The Golden Spiders on day time TV, we were instantly intrigued and tried to look out for it again. Soon we had watched the whole two seasons and totally fallen in love with the wit, humor, beauty and intricacy of Rex Stout's world.

Where to start - the troupe of actors idea is novel, and I feel brilliant as they clearly all have a deep understanding of where their current character is coming from and gain a rich understanding of the setting they are in. Having now read several of the books (I had to, the series ended too soon...) and heard from many fans of the novels, Timothy Hutton and Maury Chaykin are perfect as Archie and Wolfe respectively and the interplay between them is beautifully shown.

There is much to appreciate here aside from the storytelling, the gorgeous and opulent sets and period colours alongside the splendor of the ten thousand orchids, the vintage clothing and hairstyling. The outraged blustering of Wolfe when he comes close to revealing his affection for a member of his household, but shown clearly to us all the same by those little looks and gestures. The loyal cook and butler Fritz, who has few lines but a myriad of facial expressions and can say more in an episode than Wolfe himself.

There is so much to take from this, my husband and I have watched the entire two seasons over and over again since we first discovered them and look forward to doing so again in the future. I am now working on collecting the books (which I have discovered my 82 year old grandmother also loves, I have some copies belonging to her decades old!) and can appreciate how masterfully this adaptation has stayed faithful to the canon.

I cannot imagine one person who would buy this and regret it. Don't delay experiencing this series...you will want to do so again many times!",1306540800,2,1981,4.569014084507042

I would never have thought of Timothy Hutton to play Archie Goodwin, but he is excellent.  The sets and costumes are perfect for the time period.  The mysteries are fun.  I love the way they decided to do it with a small group of actors playing different roles each week.  It was like seeing a different play each week with the same troupe of players in a small regional theater.  Kari Matchett even plays TWO roles in one episode and it works!  Just great fun!",1289347200,3,552,4.29126213592233
2069972,5,B00029NKS8,"With Maury Chaykin playing the immobile, pensive, obese genius detective (Wolfe) and Tim Hutton playing his irreverent side-kick gumshoe (Archie Goodwin), this series set in an opulent Manhattan Brownstone on West 35th Street succeeds on so many levels. The fast-paced dialogue makes you laugh so hard you have to wipe tears off your cheeks. No matter how well you concentrate you can't beat Wolfe at solving the crime - but as you do while reading a good Sherlock Holmes story, you keep trying. Chaykin is at his best when chiding his in-house cook and taking over the preparation of a meal. There's no secret why he tilts the scales at nearly 300 lbs. He shows more of his character as he admires the wonders of his orchids. Chaykin is the most compelling actor in this series, which also benefits from strong performances by a dozen or so fabulous character actors who often play more than one role, though rarely in the same segment. The show adheres quite well to the books by Rex Stout, which is a plus. You can't find better t.v. entertainment! - johnomiller3",1279065600,6,1066,4.736559139784946

2070001,2,B00029NKS8,"I love Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe stories.  I loved the Sidney Greenstreet radio program.  I love shows like Poirot, Brother Cadfael, Monk, and Sherlock Holmes.  I thought I would love this television series, too.  I didn't.  It's an even greater shame, because the cast all seem tailor made for their roles.  Unfortunately, the viewing experience feels like sloppy, cramped, community theatre.  The pace is way too fast for the mysteries to develop and create suspense.  There's TONS of overacting, shouting, and horribly amateurish reacting.  The stable of supporting actors change roles depending on the episode which, as one other reviewer stated, makes things very confusing.  Apart from the main characters, you have to erase your memory of everybody else's characters from previous episodes as each time they play somebody different.  Nero and Archie have nice chemistry, but more often than not Mr. Chaykin yells and yells and yells, then pontificates as if he's reading poetry in a coffee shop, then yells and yells and yells.  In fact, the cast on the whole is split between theatre acting (loud, broad, melodramatic BIG characters) and television acting (soft, subtle, real people type characters).  The supporting players do weird accents and voices, make faces, and oftentimes forget to ""act"" when it's not their turn to speak (they just stop in their tracks when it's somebody else's turn to talk!).  The camera is way too close for the kind of over-the-top broad gestures, vocals, and facial movement on display; not to mention it doesn't allow the viewer a feel for space and time.  There are, fortunately, some good things about this series.  Pluses include the 40/50s style sets, costumes, and props, the actors all look like they should, and the stories themselves are faithful to the original classics (albeit far too skimmed over and condensed).  I, personally, love plays that are filmed and look live, but this series doesn't look like that's the goal.  It looks like a hodge podge of t.v., theatre, and live book reading.  It's good to have humor in a show such as this, but to just look like you're goofing around is unforgiveable.  Maybe this show is best appreciated by those who know all of the original stories by heart, and can therefore follow along from memory.  Newcomers who haven't read the books, beware.  Shows have to stand on their own and this one does not.  Dizzying in it's pace, if you're a novice to the stories, this one is very hard to follow as far as who's who.  There may be occasional bright spots in episodes and a couple of shows that are better than others, but this is a sadly missed opportunity to be a definitive series.  Give me Poirot, Cadfael, and Monk over this muck any day.  Too bad, because I really wanted to like it.",1212969600,7,2777,4.85531914893617

  The purpose of a pilot episode is to introduce, as background material, the various characters and locations to the viewer.

  When bringing this series to DVD the pilot is included in the second season set.

  Why?

  Well, it does not matter.

  If you're an avid Rex Stout enthusiast this attempt at dramatization will leave you hungry.

  Maury Chaykin as Wolfe is fine casting but the poor scripting has turned the intense Nero into an eccentric grouch.

  Timothy Hutton, who is also Director and Executive Producer, is way offline trying to act Archie.

  Fritz and Cramer? Same thing. Out of character.

  Saving grace. The venerable Saul Rubinek who nails Lon Cohen to the veritable ""T"".

His ties were pure Forties and Fifties, odd designs, garish, stylish.  He seemed like a simple Irishmen but his stock market investments were astute.  Another Nero word.

  He always had characters at his bar: World War I and II vets, New York accent, unassimilated immigrants, liable to go to a dance at the Jaeger House in Yorkville.  Polished wood, bar on one side, restaurant on the other.  The tenements, five-story walk-ups had not yet been torn down for the inevitable progression of the glass-and-steel juggernaut.

  In Brooklyn, you could pass the brownstones in Bedford-Stuyvesant area near Lewis, Willoughby and Broadway.  The city was still noisy and gritty and the Dodgers were still in Ebbetts Field.  I went in one of those brownstones for a first year high school reunion.  Green baize cover to an ornate table, polished wood, carved balustades, wealth, political influence and class, tough men who had made deals and still went to confession from time to time.

  Nero Wolfe makes me feel comfortable, there.  Time has moved on but then was then and it's a pleasure to see it re-created.",1156377600,13,1245,4.899038461538462

The 'pilot' episode that the only negative review here talks about is actually an A&E original movie that came before the series. It is found as a bonus feature in the DVD set for the second season. (It's true that that episode wasn't excellent, but we can excuse that - there are so many other episodes that are!)",1146268800,21,499,4.365591397849462
2070016,1,B00029NKS8,"that was it for me. (...) I read most of the reviews and not once did I see anyone write that this was a campy show. But campy it is. I normally like Tim Hutton but his portrayal of Archie just appears plain silly to me. The swaggering walk? The silly grins? The knowing smiles? The pilot kind of reminded me of the Dick Tracy movie with Warren Beatty. Campy and comic-bookish. I was already pretty bored with the whole thing but when Archie shot the gun out of the guy's hand and asked ""Did that hurt? Good!"" That was pretty much it for me. If you enjoyed Batman and Lost in Space on TV when you were a kid and never grew up then you'll probably think this show is okay. (...)",1141084800,7,677,4.097744360902255
2070017,5,B00029NKS8,"I have read almost the entire Nero Wolfe series, so even a half bake effort would've caught my attention.  Fortunately, I did not need to settle because this was one sharply put together TV series.  The sets are superb, especially the brownstone, which is mostly as I viewed it in my mind, except I would have Archies desk against the other wall so he could see the visitors faces while they sat in the famed red chair.  I'll have to check the books for accuracy on this point.

While Archie is the real draw in the books due to his ireepressible wit and self confidence, Nero Wolfe steals the show on TV/DVD.  He is perfectly cast and plays the role with aplomb, even getting all the eccentricities smack on.

My enjoyment of the series was only tempered by my knowledge that there is only one more season to view.  It is unlikely that it will ever be done again.  the american public likes brain dead fare, and NW requires you to engage your gray matter fairly frequently since all the facts are not spoon fed to the viewer.

1) Never read the books, so have no basis for being disappointed with the characterizations; this is neither praise nor judgment, just criteria to consider

2) Quirky sense of humor; not hilarious, laugh out loud, but amusing and entertaining

3) Two all out characterizations by Hutton and Chaykin as Archie and Wolfe respectively; Hutton goes a bit far on the odd occasion but still excellent

4) Strong stories; characterizations help prop up the slower parts

5) Good ensemble cast, with many of the same players showing up show after show; some of the actors have a very deliberate style that they carry from character to character, and that can get a bit old, but others do an excellent job; Actors playing Saul Panzer and the newspaper reporter are especially good

6) Set/costume design are terrific, with some interesting use of color and period

7) Some really poignant moments along the way, such as in Prisoner's Base, when Archie has to deal with an error in judgment that has serious ramifications

But I think that one of the best underlying reasons for getting both years of this series is that the entire production feels like a labor of love for all invovled, and you don't find that quality on TV all that often.

2070035,5,B00029NKS8,"This series one of NERO WOLFE shows what television can be when creative, talented people are given the opportunity.

The series is very faithful to the original Rex Stout novels (always a concern for fans when a series is moved to a different medium).  Maury Chaykin and Timothy Hutton bring their roles as Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin respectively to life while remaining true to the books' depictions.  The stories chosen for this set, (""The Doorbell Rang"", ""Champagne for One"", ""Prisoner's Base"", ""Eeny Meeny Murder Moe"", ""Disguise for Murder"", ""Door to Death"", ""Christmas Party"" and ""Over My Dead Body"") are all set in the late forties to early sixties which is indicated to the viewer with dialogue references to 'current' events and the costumes.

The action is fast paced, sometimes so much so that the viewer might need to replay the final scene to see how Wolfe reached his solution.  The original plots are straight from the Stout novels, and are therefore clever and fairly laid out for the viewer to follow.  The dialogue to very much in keeping with the books, the banter between Wolfe and Archie is delightful.  The other characters come to life as if they had just walked out of the pages of the novels.

The settings of this series are beautiful, this IS the familiar brownstone that fans have heard described so many times.  The other sets are detailed and correct for the time of that particular story.

One of the most intriguing aspects of this series is that while there are some actors, like Chaykin as Wolfe, Hutton as Archie and Colin Fox as Fritz the chef most of the cast change roles from episode to episode in the manner of a repertory company.  This has mixed results, a times it may confuse but only momentarily, usually it is not distracting but is instead intriguing to see how well it is done.

This is definitely a series to buy since viewing it once or twice is not enough.

The quality of the DVDs are good, the only complaints I have are first that there are not enough extras included.  The bios on Chaykin and Hutton are cursory at best.  The biggest problem is that A&E was foolish enough to cancel the series!",1107561600,40,2152,4.656084656084656
2070036,5,B00029NKS8,"""The Golden Spiders,"" which was one of Rex Stout's good efforts but not best, started it all.  A&E invested in sets, writing and a stable ensemble cast to produce the best series they have ever done.

With very, very few lapses the series represented the best that cable TV has to offer:  good writing (most often leaving it entirely to Rex - not a mistake), great production values, and highly comptent acting.  You feel as though you are a member of the household in Nero's very special clean, well-lighted place ""in the middle of the Hudson River.""  It is a placed often bathed in sunlight, showing off the yellow that was Nero's favorite color.

You can watch these shows again and again and they don't get old.  In fact, you tend to see things in them which you missed on earlier viewing.  Buy both parts of the collection when the second season becomes available again!",1097193600,19,875,4.6
2070037,5,B00029NKS8,"This kind of production restores my faith in intelligent television.  The mysteries are intriguing and perplexing enough to satisfy armchair sleuths.  Even better, the stories, the style and the dialogue are true to the period, the books, and the genre, and nothing has been dumbed down or oversimplified for a modern market.

The banter is snappy to the point of breakneck, the characters are eccentric and irracible, and all the more watchable for it.  Wolfe is elitist, reclusive and cranky. Archie is the perfect foil for him, wry and wise-cracking, and smooth talking (especially with the ladies).

I love the look of the production, from the clothes to the sets to the cars. Perhaps it's the repertory style cast that made me think this, but the sets and costumes seem almost theatrical (as in, meant of the theatre stage) in their visual interest and vibrancy. From the actors to the set dressing, this series is just marvelous to look at.

All these things make the episodes well worth repeated viewings.  As someone else mentioned, the series is 'family friendly' in that the murders happen off screen, and Archie's love life is mostly hinted at.  Though it would be nice to have more DVD extras, mostly because I find the details of a period production so interesting, I still rate this set as worth the money.",1095638400,31,1320,4.835555555555556

2070039,5,B00029NKS8,"Oscar-winner Timothy Hutton directs several episodes of this sparkling series, as well as taking on the character of jaunty gamecock Archie Goodwin, Private Detective and prime mover of the brilliant (but sometimes disinclined to take on new cases) Nero Wolfe, played by Maury Chaykin.

This first season is salted with murder, two of them occurring in Nero Wolfe's own office.  One potential client is strangled with the portly genius's own yellow-silk, barbecue-sauce-stained tie--Archie gets a lot of mileage out of this blunder by his usually meticulous boss.  There is very little violence except when Archie is asked to eject a particularly obstreperous client.  In fact if I were to pick an overriding emotion that governs these episodes, it is high good humor.  Archie's wry voice-overs, Wolfe's eccentric winter get-up in ""Door to Death,"" Fritz's icy but voiceless critique of another butler's champagne-pouring technique in ""Champagne for One"" are all priceless in-jokes for us Nero Wolfe fanatics.  Affection rather than parody governs the characters, even in the minor roles.  Occasionally Wolfe and Cramer go over the top with their blustering bad humor, but Archie usually supplies an acerbic course-correction.

The sets and costumes are fashioned with artful, low-key perfection--except for Archie's two-tone shoes.  They aren't particularly low-key.  But we fans get to see all of the dcor that made the books so--well, like comfort food for the brain: the outsized globe and chair in the study; Wolfe's tarpaulin-sized yellow-striped pajamas; Archie's snap-brim fedoras; the soothing presence of Fritz in his kitchen.

If I had a Fritz in my kitchen all would be well with my world.

Apart from major characters, certain actors and actresses show up in multiple episodes.  Two of my favorites:  Kari Machett plays a series of ditzy, seductive, sometimes unscrupulous, sometimes murdered femme fatales that Archie usually ends up falling for.  She brings out his chivalrous best, unless she happens to be the murderess.  Boyd Banks is a great well-heeled social parasite or weak-chinned younger son, although he also shows up as an FBI agent in ""The Doorbell Rang.""  He absolutely should have qualified for an Emmy for his sniveling, groveling, but absurdly cheerful Dinky Byne in ""Champagne for One.""

Nero Wolfe fans if you don't watch these A&E DVDs then pfui on you.  Go ahead and relax into the world's most famous brownstone, where you can practically smell Fritz's Bacalhau (Portuguese Salt Cod) cooking in the kitchen.",1092441600,93,2543,5.3125
2070040,5,B00029NKS8,"This is a benchmark for how book adaptations to screen, big or small, should be.  The productions are true to the books, even the dialogue.  The idea of a theater-style cast (the same players each week in different roles) was inspired.  Timothy Hutton and Maury Chaykin are wonderful as Archie and Wolfe.

Aside from the plots, the disks themselves are of superior quality.  The video transfer is excellent and the sound is terrific, muddy dialog when the episodes aired has been cleaned up and is much clearer now.

The only regret is A&E saw fit to cancel this series after only two seasons, but season two is also available on DVD if you hunt around the 'net.

Happy viewing!",1092355200,30,678,4.647058823529412
2070041,5,B00029NKS8,"Not often can we say that the movie is as good as or better than the book, but in The Doorbell Rang, I think that is the case.  Everything about this production is first-rate.

The actors are uniformly excellent, especially Maury Chaykin as Nero Wolfe and Timoth Hutton as Archie Goodwin.  This relationship must be just right for the series to work and in this case, the irascible and briliant Wolfe is countered nicely by the wisecracking, dapper, yet tough as nails Archie.  Wolfe never leaves the house.  He lets Archie gather the clues and put the strong arm on the various assortment of bad guys he meets on the job.  Nero and Archie analyze the evidence and Nero plans the next move, always to the amazement of Archie, who holds his boss in the highest esteem, and quite rightly so.  Archie is Dr. Watson to Wolfe's Sherlock Holmes.

Next, Timothy Hutton and the rest of the production crew spare no expense to make the background and environment perfect.  It feels like we have been brought back in time to the late forties.  The clothes, cars, buildings, interiors, hairstyles, and every other small detail are perfectly realized.  These details allow us to enter this world in a way that the novel does not permit, hence my preference for the film.

In the novel the FBI is only a background presence, whereas in the film we see the agents in action and watch as Nero Wolfe counters their every move.  Nero has taken a case even Archie thinks is unsolvable; that is, to stop the FBI from harassing his rich client.  Like Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe is the court of last appeal and he rises to the challenge of a difficult case.  Just as in a Holmes mystery, we must pay the closest attention if we are going to understand the train of thought of Wolfe as he analyzes the problem and sets in motion the chain of events that help him solve the case.

These Nero Wolfe stories are high quality entertainment for the serious mystery lover.  Hats off to A&E for making them available on DVD.",1091232000,47,1996,4.546218487394958
2070042,5,B00029NKS8,"I generally dislike when they take well-known detective series and make a movie or series out of them.  They generally just don't reach the quality of the novels.  However, Hutton is a class act all the way and it shows in a series they A&E should have never cancelled!

Thanks goods we can enjoy the talented production, the true homage to Rex Stout's vision and some super Archie Antics!",1091232000,26,389,4.608695652173913

8024366,5,B00029NKS8,"I became a fan of Rex Stout's fictional private detective Nero Wolfe in the late 1960s during my first tour in Vietnam when I was given a copy of ""Fer-de-Lance"" by another guy in my rifle platoon.
Since that time I have devoured all of the Wolfe novels and re-read many of them several times.
I haven't always been, however, a big fan of the television and film adaptations of Stout's novels and short stories. I'm not sure exactly why that is, but they just seemed to be lacking something. That changed recently when I discovered the Arts & Entertainment series starring Timothy Hutton and Maury Chaykin as Archie Goodwin and Wolfe. Hutton has managed to capture Goodwin's irreverent attitude and Chaykin does a fine job portraying Wolfe, the enormous, orchid-loving, genius detective who needs specially designed furniture to accommodate his considerable bulk. Unusual for a television series, this first season features a stable cast with various actors and actresses (including the wonderful Kari Matchett) playing different roles from episode to episode. Matchett, for example, plays a Montenegrin refugee in one adventure; Goodwin's on-again, off-again love interest Lily Rowan in another; and the daughter of a millionaire in yet another. Author George Plimpton also appears in different roles in the series. This core cast of actors gives the series the feel of a theatrical company and adds, I think, to its charm.
The cinematography is excellent and the attention to detail, giving the sets the look and feel of New York City in the late 1940s and early 1950s, is remarkable. The costumes, cars, and even the make-up the female characters wear is spot on.
The scripts are smoothly written and though they take some liberties with Stout's novels that's not troubling to me. The plots are interesting as are the characters and the direction is seamless. The narrative in each episode flows along without a hitch making this an enjoyable series that I have no trouble recommending to fans of smartly written and well-acted detective shows.",1459900800,2,2046,5.074183976261128
