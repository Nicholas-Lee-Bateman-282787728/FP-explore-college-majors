8466007,3,B00097C4D0,"Surveys the life of Mexican writer Antonieta Rivas, with a focus on her political activity in the 1920s. There is a subplot of a French researcher who comes to Mexico to discover the story. Part of the theme is rebellion against Mexican deferance to European tastes in art and customs, and against American imperialism. (Although, oddly  enough, the only imperialism these rebels can come up with is Coca Cola replacing wine as a popular beverage.)

In fact, however, the producers of the film refused to use Mexican talent, importing instead a director from Spain, a German to play the French researcher, and Isabelle Adjani to play the Mexican protagonist.

The characters, themselves, seem to be partly 19th century romantics, and partly an alienated post-war lost generation, forming a cultural stata high above real Mexican life, while proporting to be totally committed to the revolutionary turmoil going on around them.

The DVD tranfer is very bad, with a poor image, and the film even slipping out of the fame a couple of times. There is only a Spanish soundtrack and no subtitles.

Even so, as a portrait of that period of Mexican history, and a quirky bit of filmmaking I find that the film is worth having.",1134172800,,1218,4.893203883495145
