3172492,5,B0017IANI8,"This captivating video explores many facets of Mexico in a way that shows a coherent understanding of the thought processes and attention triggers of its target audience (approx 6 Months to 6 Years). The production values are high with a mixture of animation, video, and puppetry. Plenty of costumes and emphasis on animals and music. A must see for anyone with small children learning about or visiting Mexico (nowhere in the video, however, is the child admonished not to drink the water ;) Apparently, the executive producer is a mother of small kids who knows what keeps their interest.",1242259200,2,590,4.96969696969697
3172493,5,B0017IANI8,"My son just loves this DVD and has loved it for two years (from age almost-4 to almost-6) and is still watching. THe thing I love the most is that he requests to watch it in each of the different languages. At Stanford University, I was taught by a linguist that it is critical to hear at least one foreign language regularly before age 5 in order to be able to speak any foreign language with a proper accent later in life. This DVD fills the bill in that regard and the video portion is captivating as well. I highly recommend it.",1241827200,,532,4.2254901960784315
3172494,5,B0017IANI8,"My son loves this DVD. While he is learning about Mexico, he is learning a lot more than that because the DVD breaks down into different topics that kids his age can relate to.  He learns about fish, animals, plants, sports (soccer), food, music, and instruments.  The beauty of this is that we can show it to him in different languages.  There is a large variety of words and it helps him expand his vocabulary in more than one language.  He laughs at the puppet scenes and moves to the fun music.

My kids especially loved watching the soccer match (my 2-year really loves soccer), the volcano erupt (something they had never seen), and the cowboy trip in the dessert.

My kids have been watching this over and over again -- which is always a testament to how much they love a DVD.  Each time, they seem to be interested in something different.

3172498,5,B0017IANI8,"Globe-Toddlers Adventures in Mexico DVD provides children with an exciting introduction to the country and its culture.  Through the use of puppets, cultural music and children in native dress, Mexico and its vibrant traditions, customs, and way of life is brought alive for young children.

  The DVD delighted and entertained my son of eight months and his two-year-old cousin.  In spite of their age differences, both boys enjoyed the video.  My baby was only able to watch for twenty minutes, but his cousin liked the whole program.

  Many different topics and themes are covered to introduce the country of Mexico.  The topics included:  mariachis, traditional Mexican toys, transportation, the folkloric ballet, cowboys and cactus, the beach, pirates, the jungle and the different animals in the jungle, the pyramids of Mexico, soccer, food, the celebration of birthdays and the work of artisans.
  Language played a role in the presentation of each topic.  There were over a hundred and fifteen spoken and written words teaching colors, numbers, names of animals, and a variety of other topics.
As a mother raising a bilingual child, I appreciated that the video offered the chance to be viewed in four different languages--English, French, Spanish and Chinese.  Since I speak to my son in Spanish, we watched the video in this language; however it is interesting to watch the video in other languages as well.  The Chinese version includes the Chinese characters as well as the phonetic spelling of the word using the Roman alphabet.

  While watching the video with my son, I would add dialogue and commentary to supplement the vocabulary and topics introduced in the video.  Viewing the video was interactive, with many topics and opportunities for me to comment and further explain aspects of what we were watching.  With my two-year-old nephew, these interactions took on an added dimension, as I was able to ask him questions.  He was able to respond and remark on what we were watching.  I felt that the interaction was key to helping both children learn from the video, and it was also a fun way to spend time with them.

  This video teaches kids about Mexico.  It is a tour of the country with live footage of ocean fish, animals and plants that caught the attention of my son and his cousin.  Not only do children learn about Mexico, but other topics are covered too.  The transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly was shown and the steps to make guacamole were revealed.  The video provides educational lessons in an entertaining manner.  My son especially liked the puppets that were in the video.

  We really enjoyed the music in the DVD as well.  This music can be listened to on its own in a CD that contains the soundtrack to the Adventures in Mexico DVD.  The music is traditional Mexican music.  It is upbeat music that can be danced to.  In addition to playing the music for my son and his cousin, as a Spanish teacher, I will use the music in my classroom to introduce my students to the music of Mexico.  The CD provides exposure to new music and allows for music appreciation.
  In the video, a map is used to introduce different regions of Mexico.  This same map also comes in the form of a placemat that can be written on with disposable markers.  My two-year old nephew enjoyed drawing on the placemat after dinner.  Being part Mexican, his mom used the map to teach her son where his grandparents and other family members are from.  The various states of Mexico are presented in different colors.  There are also pictures with the corresponding vocabulary words in Spanish detailing other pertinent aspects of Mexico.  My nephew was most interested in the sea life presented--the gray whales, the tuna, and the turtle.  As he would point to the different pictures, I would teach him how to say the words in Spanish.

  I very much enjoyed the DVD, placemat, and corresponding music CD.  I liked the presentation of Mexican culture, the lessons on nature, and especially the presentation of Spanish, English, French or Chinese vocabulary throughout.  By interacting with my son and providing additional content while watching the video, he will learn new things each time we watch the video together.  We will be watching and learning from this video for years to come.",1217462400,3,4311,4.865013774104683

They are fascinated by the live footage of the real fish and animals and my eldest wants to watch it in all of the languages and has learned how to count to ten in Spanish and Chinese thanks to this DVD.

8266036,1,B0017IANI8,"I am BAFFLED that this got such high reviews ...WHY????
The kids do not learn the IMPORTANT basics instead they learn how to say the names of musical instruments, exotic  not farm or pet animals, plants from Mexico

OK so this is a trip to Mexico...but Hello and Goodbye and How are you , what is your name COULD be in here as well as all of the rest of the words which are not going to be used !!!! Nothing of importance to a toddler speaking/understanding etc is in here
On the BACK of this innapropriately named DVD it saysespecially useful for children under 2. REALLY??? a 2 yr old wants/needs to say plant/exotic animal/instrument etc  names???

Hi and BYE, Please and Thank you, Mom and Dad and OWIE etc are what all the kids I know say including ALL of my Spanish friends. They think this is nonsense for a TODDLER
This is more for 5th grade

I teach ESL and let me tell you NONE of the words they learn in this DVD are everyday , necessary words
The people I teach need to know BODY parts for when they are sick to their stomach they are not sent to ER for their heart or kept home for a stomach bug when it is their heart !!!!
this happens regularly when the language is not taught wisely.....I have to teach all sorts of words not in ESL in beginning books in order for these people to function , so I am very sensitive to
proper order ..everyday and important words FIRST
They need to know common everyday items, greetings etc etc
NOT what they saw in Mexico , items and words that even the Mexicans are not using very often!!!
Do you talk about plants, insects and exotic animals or even birthday parties daily...weekly...monthly???

This is OK for OLDER kids who know the basics and want to see a different country and its interesting places and things and ways.nOT toddlers

Want to learn Spanish?? Take your Signing Time DVD and put it in Spanish after child learns the English and WOW they take off in 2 languages !!Make that THRee as signing is a language !!!!!

Get around the Spanish speaking community or even  Spanish speaking friend and speak only in spanish in front of and with Child

heck take any DVD the child knows well and turn it onto the Spanish and also get the captions in Spanish...some do this , others English captions only...but that still works !!
forget this , save your money if you have a toddler The other way I mentioned above teaches 3 things....or even if it is a Sesame Street , disney DVD  they still pick up the Spanish and remember to turn on subtitles...always a plus to learn letters and reading
I hope I have helped you

pS French is on here but French in Mexico?? Chinese in Mexico???",1296432000,,2638,4.3612244897959185

This DVD may be watched in English, French, Spanish or Chinese with the Pin Yin included so parents who do not know Chinese can help with pronunciation.  If families are traveling to Mexico or have relatives in Mexico, this is a great DVD to watch before, while in Mexico, and after.  Parents can discuss geography and cultural themes that relate to Mexico.  I like that Tot Talk suggests that parents watch the DVD with their children.  This creates an experience for the children and parents together. Parents can discuss and fill in details as needed depending on the age of the child.  There are multiple levels of learning starting with  just enjoying music and hearing language.  One does not have to travel to Mexico to enjoy this  educational DVD..

The content is well laid out, starting with a big concept and then narrowing to specifics.  For example, the DVD shows a big map of Mexico, introduces a state and then depicts several environmental/cultural features of that region.  With this level of detail, and with the use of children in the DVD, ranging in age from babies to children (and not exclusively puppets), the DVD is appropriate for a wider range of children.  It makes it easier for siblings to watch together.  The humor is entertaining and the music is colorful.  The DVD offers opportunities for extension activities as well.
