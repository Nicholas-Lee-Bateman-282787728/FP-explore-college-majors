Yes all except one The Big Trail are supposed to be in color. And that kinda tells me something about the prints they used to produce this box set. One REALLY has to be careful when purchasing esp older films. Alot of ""DVD"" versions were not remastered and cleaned up but merely dumped to dvd from seriously flawed prints.",1475452800,2,329,4.5
