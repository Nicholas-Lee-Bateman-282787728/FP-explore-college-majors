4098952,1,B0039WHKE0,"This British production is based on Chris Ryan's book of the same title which is no great literature.  Knowing Sky's ambition for the series and Richard Armitage's involvement, I had high hopes that it would improve on the book.  Sadly, it failed to do so.  The series is comprised of three stories showing the three missions that John Porter, the main character, was sent to accomplish.  They became repetitive quickly.  In the first story, Porter still retained some of the human characteristics that Ryan gave him and had a wife and daughter to make him multi-dimensional.  By the third story, he had morphed into a killing machine whom no bullet or missile can penetrate.  I'm a great fan of Richard Armitage's and have watched everything he's in.  This show is a waste of his talent.  Shows like this should star actors whose main claim to fame is their physicality rather than their acting ability.  Oh, in the third story, the Americans are the chief villains and are made out to be worse than the Taliban and al-Queda. This sort of vitriol would no doubt come as a surprise to anyone who had thought that the US and UK were allies.",1287964800,8,1139,4.65
4098953,1,B0039WHKE0,"I'm a fan of Richard Armitage's, but oh, my he deserved so much better than this gung-ho, silly, over the top macho nonsense.  I watched the whole thing, but I won't want the second season.  There were good moments; his relationship with a hostage he saves is sensitively done and completely persuasive.  I was embarrassed for him, poor man.  He has done some wonderful work in shows in which he plays awful men: a pedophile, a wife beater, a murderer, a drug runner, and he and the shows have been wonderful . . . and he's played some kind, funny, heroic, admirable men.  He's got wide range. For me, this is his worst role--it's almost nothing but beefcake and machismo.  The climax is a scene we've seen a million times before in a million tough-guy movies, and requires Armitage to say cliches like ""This ends now!!"" He's a wonderful actor and there are many moments when that's visible, but this was not the vehicle for  him to demonstrate what he can do best, and . . . I cringed for him.  It's just embarrassing, and I felt sorry for him that this was the best role he was offered.  He deserves so much better.",1287273600,10,1117,4.436274509803922
4098954,5,B0039WHKE0,"I bought the dvd version of this elsewhere too, but it is so visually stunning in content that it can only be enhanced by the quality of the technology on which it is presented.

It is basically an action adventure series but being set in current areas of conflict we sometimes get a feel of what that is like for the real people involved in that work, even if the stories presented take the same kind of liberties with reality that a purely fantasy action adventure takes.  We know the hero won't be killed, at least until the last episode for instance, can do amazing things when injured etc, but the reality context nevertheless creates a bit of extra oomph I find.

I loved it as action adventure, and it has stories at several levels.  An episode mission, an overarching series line which was very good, buddy stories within each episode.  Each aspect includes its own tensions and really gripping tension a lot of the time.

Good value entertainment for me with a very good cast.",1287187200,3,985,4.568181818181818
4098955,5,B0039WHKE0,"I'll admit, I got this show from the UK (I couldn't wait for it to appear on US shores) but I still bought it from Amazon, okay?

I loved this show. The stories were gripping and get you completely caught up in the action and twists and turns of the plot. I loved the cast (in particular ""Robin Hood"" and ""Spooks"" brooding hottie Richard Armitage in the lead) and the action was non-stop. If you like shows like ""24"" and ""Prison Break,"" you should enjoy this as well. There are differences between all these shows obviously, but if you like action shows with gunplay, explosions, intrigue, and adventure, then ""Strike Back"" is for you.

The story is based on a Chris Ryan novel (of the same name) and while I haven't read the novel yet, I hear on good authority that the adaptation takes some liberty with the story, and may actually improve it overall.

There are three separate ""stories"" in this miniseries. The first shows our hero, John Porter (the aforementioned Richard Armitage) leave the military after a disgrace--apparently a lapse in judgment on his part indirectly caused the death of two of his men, and leaves another incapacitated. Fast forward several years later, and our hero is at an all-time low. Separated from his family, working as a security guard and living in what looks like some sort of flop house. But, new information comes forward about that fated episode that ended his career, and he sees an opportunity to make things right. Cue a lot of adventure and a rescue mission, plus new information on his so-called ""disgrace.""

The next ""story"" involves our hero being sent into an African prison to retrieve a British soldier who tried to assassinate an African political leader. What will happen after Porter and the soldier escape? Who was really behind the assassination attempt? Lots of adventure and gunfights follow.

The last story wraps things up with a resolution of Porter's previous ""disgrace,"" and also involves Porter trying to find a loopy Scotsman who has been helping terrorists with a sophisticated weapon. More action and adventure (this story is a bit more bloody than the other two) and finally some closure for Porter. But we are left wanting more, and the news is, there are more episodes of ""Strike Back"" planned! Woo hoo!

Because this is a British show, there is a different feel to it in spots. For instance, the ""bad guys"" in one of the episodes are the Americans! (The CIA specifically.) Well, we know the CIA has done some bad stuff, so this was not a deal-breaker for me, but it did take me aback at first. (""Jane Eyre"" hottie Toby Stephens plays the lead bad guy, and does a pretty good job with his American accent.)

I really liked much of the cast, including ""Walking Dead"" hottie Andrew Lincoln who makes a simultaneously sympathetic but weak villain, and Johdi May (as an associate of the Lincoln character) never disappoints in anything she is in.",1285459200,52,2912,4.743083003952569

Realistic locations in Africa.  Forget the following seasons -  I was hoping but they must have changed writers or etc - so don't imagine the follow ups are like the first season.

4098976,5,B0039WHKE0,"Chris Ryan's: Strike Back (U.K. Blu-ray is Region Free, but reported non playback. It actually has nothing to do with Regions. This disc is All Regions (A, B, and C) so it should play in any Blu-ray player worldwide. However because it is a U.K. Mastered Disc, the video is 1080i/50Hz. Video in the U.S. is 60Hz. Check to see if your Blu-ray Player and T.V. support 50Hz playback (25 frames per second). Why it was Mastered at 1080i/50Hz I don't know as the U.K. can play up to 1080P/60Hz (30 frames a second) as standard no problem as that is what most films and T.V. Blu-ray Releases here in the U.K. are, it seems that they have used the BBC (2 Entertain Distribution Company) preferred Blu-ray Release Format as they seem to only release in 1080i/50Hz because that is what they use to broadcast the programs in the U.K and they are too cheap to re-master to 1080P/60Hz for U.K. Blu-ray Releases. So if you have any U.K. BBC Released Blu-rays (eg. Dr Who U.K. Issued) you should have no problem playing this disc). However, if your Blu-ray Player does not convert 50Hz to 60Hz such as the U.S. Panasonic and Sony players it will not play. Even if your Blu-ray player does output 50Hz, your T.V. must be able to accept the signal. I believe in the U.S. this season is known as Strike Back: Origins and as yet not released.",1435190400,4,1324,4.4526748971193415

Don't really want to explain what Scott was doing to that woman and why don't they have clothes on to a 5 year old.  The sets don't seem as elaborate as the later seasons but are still good.

4098990,4,B0039WHKE0,"This British Region-2 PAL DVD requires a multi-region DVD player in North America. I have one, and it plays fine. I thought I should comment on this 6-part, approximately 4-1/2 hour production, which was released only in the UK prior to Cinemax/HBO picking up the Strike Back series with British Sky TV the following year. In brief, Cinemax/HBO spent a lot more money on their (so-far) three seasons of the show. The present series (call it UK season one) is based on the Chris Ryan book of the same name, and thus follows Ryan's story of John Porter. (Porter - the character - also makes a brief appearance in Cinemax/HBO season one - episodes one/two, which are thus UK season two.) I have also watched Cinemax/HBO seasons one and two, and can therefore compare the two productions. Here are the similarities and differences: (1) The acting and narrative meet a high standard in both productions. I would credit ALL the actors in both productions. (2) This series is shorter, at six episodes (technically, they are presented as three, 2-part episodes), whereas the Cinemax/HBO product runs to ten episodes. (3) Cinemax/HBO spent A LOT more money on its seasons, and the difference in production values is obvious. While both are set in real-world venues, UK season one feels more enclosed. It is also more sombre and serious. (4) I think most strikingly, UK season one (this product) has a simply poor soundtrack. That is, the music is overly melodramatic and simplistic, and the sound quality is not inspiring either - to state it charitably. Honestly, the booming, urgent and intrusive background music in this one is difficult to listen to, particularly after you've watched the Cinemax/HBO series, which is an extremely professionally-produced product. So, in brief, this is a much lower-budget production, and that fact stands out when comparing seasons. (5) Due to the production differences, this season has not so far been released in North America. Unfortunately, this is probably also a consequence of the fact that the budget was lower, and probably nobody was thinking of international release when this series was pieced together. Too bad... as, again, dramatically, this is an equally good product. (6) Richard Armitage as Porter easily stands up to Philip WInchester as Stonebridge and Sullivan Stapleton as Damien Scott in the subsequent Cinemax/HBO series. What he is lacking is the big budget, the soundtrack, the studio promotion, and - to some extent - the screenwriting (that is, Porter is denied the moments of ""fun"" that Stonebridge and Scott are sometimes allowed). IN CONCLUSION: It's too bad that this first UK series was run at such a low budget... as just fixing up the soundtrack would pretty well bring this UK-only series up to par with the subsequent Cinemax/HBO effort, of which I also have a high opinion.",1405123200,3,2841,5.00845665961945

4099016,5,B0039WHKE0,"This is the first season of the British ""Strike Back"" TV show. There are 3 episodes, each about 1.5 hours. This is a anti-terrorism action show, similar to the American ""24"" except faster paced, with a bigger political plot (George Bush's WMDs), and without the boring whining Kim Bauer. If you enjoyed ""24"", you'll probably like this too. For some reason, when Strike Back was shown in the USA, they deleted season 1 and started with season 2. Maybe the George Bush plot was too controversial for thin skinned viewers?

This Blu-Ray set is imported from England. It plays fine on my low-end LG Blu-Ray player, though other comments say it doesn't work with Sony players because the frame timing is slightly different. Do your research before buying. Better Blu-Ray players should adjust for the timing.

Interestingly, there is a cheaper Blu-Ray package that combines this 2-disc season 1 set with the 3-disc season 2 set. I do not know why you would want to pay more money for season 1 alone. Season 2 is different from season 1, but still a lot of fun.

While this statement is factually correct, it still won't play because the disc itself is mastered in a format/ frame rate that won't work with most players. Be careful. This feature is mastered in a 1080i/50 format. Most machines will deal with only 1080i/60 or 1080i/24. Even if the player will pass the signal, make sure your display will show it.

I also obtained my copy through Amazon UK, not being willing to wait until the powers that be on this side of the pond decided to import it, watched it all the way through the day I got it and yet again, discovered a new side to Mr. Armitage I had not seen previously.  He makes a fabulous action hero and manages to come across as both powerful and vulnerable at the same time, giving the story depth it might not otherwise have had. This is NOT your usual shoot-em-up actioner--there are many facets to the storylines.  Also worthy of mention here are Andrew Lincoln and Jodhi May, but the show definitely belongs to Armitage--and what were they thinking to import the series and begin it with the second season?  Very glad I didn't wait!

It comes with three stories of approximately 1 1/2 hours each and has many surprises, fantastic action, realistic violence and even nudity.  I couldn't wait to see the next story after finishing each earlier story. The stories involve special forces missions to Iraq, Zimbabwe and finally Afghanistan.  Seems to have been filmed with a very high budget and the stories are as entertaining as any feature film involving soldiers since Apocalypse Now.  The series' hero, Richard Armitage is awesome.  A renegade action hero like a cross between James Bond and GI Joe.  Apparently Armitage had to drop out of season 2 which was picked up by Cinemax so that he could film the Hobbit movies (although I think he appears in a cameo).

I was aware of the playback issues with this Blu-ray and the seller that I bought from was good enough to enclose an explanation about the player being capable of accepting 50/60Hz.

Curiously, my Denon AVR showed DTS Master input in 2.0, and output 7.1.  I didn't mess around with settings in the receiver and/or player to see if I could get a true surround input; I was happy just to be able to watch the show.  And a great show it is.

IMHO, Strike Back may have the best production value of any show of this genre that was developed for a UK audience.

Quick series synopsis:

SAS John Porter leads a hostage extraction in Iraq which goes wrong resulting in the death of 3-British soldiers. Porter takes the blame and leaves the army in disgrace, but returns 7 years later to redeem himself in another hostage situation. While there are 3-somewhat independent stories, there are also flashbacks to what happened in Iraq, which leads to the final conclusion of who was really to blame?

4099059,5,B0039WHKE0,"WOW...Richard Armitage is HOT STUFF!!! Check out that delicious bod! He bulked up for the role real good!

Now on to the bad news: Why, oh why, did he have to be killed off the new ""Strike Back: Project Dawn"" series?!?! HUH! What?!  Armitage is an ""A class"" actor who (like Matt Damon's Jason Bourne) has an inner action hero inside him.  He's totally convincing in the role and makes it all the better with his hunky self.

Cinemax's new Strike Back got me into the original Strike Back. However, after watching the original, Armitage is definitely the one guy who consistently makes the show fun, compelling, and exciting!! So what's the deal? Why did he have to be killed off! Although he's currently filming Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit,"" did the producers really find it necessary to kill off one of the best characters (i.e., John Porter) in the freakin' universe! It's so unlike Porter. He's a very resourceful guy and manages to escape near-death and hopeless situations time and time again. (He actually reminds me of Francis Crawford of Lymond--the anti-hero of Dorothy Dunnett's legendary Lymond Chronicles). His end is totally shocking and like what Kate said in ""Project Dawn"": I'm surprised he didn't put up a bigger fight!

I know this is useless plea, but I really hope he comes back--create a resurrection (I don't care!)--just bring Porter back!! There's so many unanswered questions and loose ends--notably the big gap between the ending of Ep. 3 and how Porter got into that compromising situation of Ep. 1 in ""Project Dawn."" Also, questions regarding Porter's daughter Lexie (who's now parentless by his death); Porter's relationship with Danni; and MIA Layla! The latter two women were crucial players for Section 20...so where are they now????

This 2-disc set provides 3 explosive episodes (each ep. is 2 hours long) and includes the following bonus features:

*On Strike: Making Chris Ryan's Strike Back
*Guns 'N' Ammo: Arming Strike Back
*Spotlight on location: Shooting South Africa

Verdict: I LOVE IT!!!! It's awesome! It's incredibly easy to set up and use (switching to different regions/codes is a cinch). Also, it's very lightweight and compact--compared to the Sony, which is heavier and bulkier. There are additional features that I don't intend to use, but for the price--viewing DVDs in enhanced resolution or Blu-rays from any country around the world--it's a definite keeper!

I agree with the rave reviews: ""Strike Back"" is visually stunning (more so in this Blu-ray), with in-depth characters and creative storylines. There's loads of action and military/political intrigue. There's effortless humor, romance, and some heartfelt moments--especially between Orla Brady and Armitage in Ep. 1. Also, there's one *sniff* sex scene. It's sensual but VERY tamed--unlike the new ""Project Dawn,"" where there's hardcore (almost porno) sex in the first episode alone! Don't get me wrong; Scott and Stonebridge are real hotties!!! The more ""action"" I get to see, the better!! Meanwhile, I'll be watching ""Strike Back"" and Richard Armitage over and over again. They're just that cool!

Final note: PORTER must be resurrected!!! Section 20 needs HIM!",1314489600,2,3664,5.356521739130435
4099060,4,B0039WHKE0,"STRIKE BACK is indeed on a DVD as evidenced here, but August 12, 2011 introduced the series STRIKE BACK for the television audiences here in the USA and the first episode is impressive, promising a well-made series to come.  The story is not all that original and not having read Chris Ryan's novel on which it is based, judging whether or not it is true to the book is not possible.  But basically this is another team of tough but loveable good guys working for the British Intelligence on various missions - the mission for the first episode deals with a soldier John Porter (Richard Armitage)  from the British group who is held captive by the Pakistanis who send videos to the headquarters to release their prisoners.  Headquarters included some fine actors: Sgt Julia Richmond (Michelle Lukes) and Colonel Grant (Amanda Mealing) and Sinclair (Rhashan Stone) - with a little help from an Indian agent played by Jimi Mistry - and the front fighting man Stonebridge (Philip Winchester) who manages to find the renegade womanizer and brilliant soldier Damien Scott (Sullivan Stapleton) to protect against a discovered terrorist attack on the New Lotus Hotel.  It is action packed, full of killing and explosions  and the requisite steamy sex scenes to attract all audiences who dote on action programs. The difference in this series is the relationships  among the actors/characters in the forces. They are all fine actors, all are eye candy, and all have a sense of perspective that gives them credibility.  It seems that they will be an entertaining and clever team to watch in action.  Looks like a good series for the summer! Note:  The second episode is even better than the first! Grady Harp, August 11",1313193600,4,1710,4.885813148788928
4099061,4,B0039WHKE0,"I rather enjoyed this first mini-series (season one) of UK Sky1's ""Strike Back"" starring Richard Armitage and Andrew Lincoln. The essence of this series at its core, expanded over 6 episodes, is essentially about John Porter (portrayed by Richard Armitage) and how one crucial decision he made not to shoot a young suicide bomber, despite all his SAS training, effected the lives of not only himself and his family, but his comrades as well, including Hugh Collinson (played by Andrew Lincoln). The result of his decision leaves two of his comrades dead, one in a comatose state, and himself effectively dishonorably discharged and without a job. Alienated by his family and friends who are ashamed of him and blame him for his actions, his marriage falls apart and he ends up sinking to the depths of security man humiliation hell. But the kidnapping of journalist Katie Dartmouth leads him back to the road of redemption and ... the truth of what really happened when he made the decision that changed his entire life.

The episodes are meant to be watched back-to-back, so episodes one and two would be the first act, while episode three and four would be the second act, and five and six the third act, with a different story and ""villain"" in every act. I've never read the Chris Ryan novels, so I entered this with only the knowledge that the show had casted outstanding British actors like Richard Armitage (of BBC's North and South, Robin Hood and Spooks fame - soon to be seen in Captain America: The First Avenger and Peter Jackson's The Hobbit I and II), Andrew Lincoln (of AMC's Walking Dead fame - though Lincoln's accent seemed to be disappearing on him at times), Jodhi May (of BBC's Daniel Deronda and Emma fame), Toby Stephens (need I say more? Though Toby Stephens is a little over-the-top in his delivery as an American CIA agent) and Colin Salmon (of James Bond and Resident Evil fame). The actors are really the saving grace of this show and kudos must be given to Armitage, Lincoln and May for holding the show together as the leads. May, portrays the only sensible female character with any sort of real character development, and she delivers a great performance for what she's given.

Stereotype and clichs abound, this show is definitely ""unapologetically macho"" with endless scenes of action and fighting to mirror the Call of Duty video games. All you can do is sit back and enjoy the ride. At times the show is guilty of portraying the villains as one-dimensional and having stilted dialogue, but its worse offensive is without a doubt the ""male fantasy"" love interest. I don't mind the mind-numbing big-budget action sequences, I actually found it entertaining and thrillingly suspenseful (even if my belief had to be suspended, yes I can admit I like watching good looking men kickass), but the convoluted ""love interest"" sex scenes were an unnecessary attempt to copy the whole James Bond-clich of ""look at me bag the young hot secretary, Ma!"" Of course, another flaw in the show is the under-development of John Porter's family. They're just sort of there, hanging in the very very background. There's really no explanation or development for what happens to them or how they're dealing, except that we know they're in anguish, so it's really up to the audience to guess what's going on there. Worse, is the lack of explanation on how John Porter suddenly is beginning an affair with the clichd ""love interest,"" who of course, reeks in lack of character development. I understand there was only six episodes and no room for character development for every single character, but really, they could of done with cutting out his family and the ""love interest"" (or at least just the ""love interest"") because I don't think anyone cared for them. If they really had to force a ""love interest,"" I actually felt that Armitage and May had better chemistry and it would have been more interesting to watch Porter and Layla get together.

But my criticism of the clichd ""love interest"" aside, the show's strength, besides its big-budget action sequences and its visually cinematic shots, are the over-arching storylines of John Porter's road to redemption and the dynamic between Porter and Collinson. Porter's methods and escape sequences are epically extraordinary and belief-suspending of epic proportions, yet they're so fun to watch and Armitage makes it look all so easy. He really is great at playing these testosterone filled-type of characters, yet he's also really good at portraying their vulnerabilities and conflicting emotions. Same with Lincoln. The episode two escape sequence is an example where ""Strike Back"" really succeeds. Without giving too much away, it gives you the big-budget action, but it also gives you an adrenaline-rushed sequence between Porter and Collinson that reminds the audience what these two actors are capable of and what, each character is trying to accomplish. Armitage and Lincoln are so good at what they do that they keep roping you in for the next episodes to find out what happens. In the finale, the cat and mouse chase between Porter and Collinson ultimately ends up blowing up in a confrontation between the two. This is where Armitage and Lincoln are at their best. And you really feel for both characters, despite their actions, despite their flaws. Without these two actors, this show would have been just a bad ""shoot 'em up"" carbon copy of Rambo. Thankfully, it's not. If I just fast-forward through the ""love interest"" bits, this series would be a solid A in the guilty pleasures category. I love the British humor and the gratuitous shirtless scenes of John Porter. In honesty, this show wouldn't have been different than any other show in its same genre, but it's really the performances by Armitage, Lincoln, and May, along with guest appearances by Orla Brady and Toby Stephens, that really make this show worth watching.

Hopefully in the US, series one will be aired on Cinemax or HBO because I've learned some interesting survival techniques like when all else fails, hide a knife up your butt and you will be saved. This series, from what I've gathered from other reviews, is a show that's more catered to American tastes than British tastes, which is why it was so surprising that this series was commissioned by a British television network, Sky1. Of course, following the rather moderate success of season one in the UK, season two is being co-produced with Cinemax which means expect more mind-numbing action and probably less character development. The character of John Porter will be back for season two, but in limited minutes as there will be two new leads to take over the show as it heads in a different direction than the first season (understandable as Richard Armitage would probably rather be filming the Hobbit in a chance of a lifetime role as Thorin, than filming Strike Back 2, which at best, is a B-grade action TV drama). To sum it all up, if you have nothing to do on a Saturday evening and find yourself looking for action-packed entertainment with a dose of good old British humor and acting (coupled along with some nice man-candy, just kidding, it's the character development that's important here!), then check this series out.",1306886400,6,7240,4.902936378466558
4099062,2,B0039WHKE0,"I was most looking forward to receiving this Blu-Ray Disc.  I had previously ordered this through a bookstore (twice) and both times it wouldn't play on my brand new Blu-Ray player.  I thought, ""I should have just ordered this from Amazon in the first place.""  Guess what, I ordered it twice through them, and twice more, the disc would not play.  Amazon was very good at responding back to me the first time I had an issue, and I found it quite easy to return it both times.  However, I was disappointed that the manufacturer, or whoever, made this disc unplayable.  Just wanted to let others know before they go through the trouble of ordering it.",1306022400,25,649,4.551724137931035
4099063,5,B0039WHKE0,"Can't understand the other reviews that aren't raving about this show but, whatever--I LOVED it! The first 15 minutes of the first episode about the SAS getting a hostage out of Iraq was awesomely good. The SAS (like Delta/Navy SEALS/Marine Recon) are guys totally dedicated to serving their country at very high risk to their lives and they don't get rich doing it. Andrew Lincoln (Walking Dead on AMC), and Richard Armitage (MI-5 on BBC)are both terrific as tough SAS operatives who wind up in very different places from each other after the first episode. This show is the equivilant to the movie ""Bravo Two-Zero"" with Sean Bean. If you liked that film--you will love this series.",1303430400,5,683,4.846153846153846
4099064,2,B0039WHKE0,"This is visually very well done, and you can see that a good deal of attention was given to details.  Lots of gadgets and action and blood and guns.  Andrew Lincoln, Jodhi May (love her), and Richard Armitage gave good performances, but I couldn't quite warm up to the John Porter character.  His conscience causes him to make a decision during a mission that he feels is morally right, but towards the end he caves in to the opinions of his comrades and his commanding officer, so he didn't seem much of a hero to me. I was disappointed at the dialog, which felt dumbded-down and was full of cliches and the F-word. I've seen Richard Armitage in a few other things and enjoy his acting (nice voice), but every other scene involved him taking off his shirt.  Not that I minded, at least it distracted me from the lousy dialog!  There is a love interest, though not very exciting (to me or my husband) and looked as if it was just put in there for the sake of more cliche.

This is definitely more a man's movie, and my husband said it was OK, though by the last episode it did feel pretty repetitive and he kept wandering away to the kitchen.  Two hours could have told the whole story.",1288742400,6,1186,4.339366515837104
4099065,5,B0039WHKE0,"If you aren't aware - this is a British Action Series made for TV. Britain has always been known for their excellent dramas & mysteries, but the action genre has been dominated by US film industry.  This was filmed in South Africa on a tv budget and it is well done. The directors & writers are the cream of the crop, so to speak. The production values are tops and in the age of CGI, the panoramic scenery IS the real thing.  I understand they used three different directors and there are three separate stories with a connecting arc, as a result each part has a different feel.  For me personally, I liked the story in the first the best & the pace & climax of the story in the last. My partner liked all three equally.  You will find portrayed a unique balanced attitude toward problems in the Middle East and some of the 'good guys' going after people who should be their allies.  If you are looking for a Chris Ryan story only one part of this three parter is based upon his book, but the other two were not.

 The characters are John Porter (Richard Armitage, currently cast/filming Capt. America & The Hobbit), a former SAS Sergeant, and Hugh Collinson (Andrew Lincoln  currently in The Walking Dead), a Section 20 officer in the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). There is a excellent cast comprised of Orla Brady, Shelley Conn, Colin Salmon and Jodhi May, including a variety of guest appearances including Toby Stephens, Ewen Bremner, Dhaffer L'Abidine, Shaun Parkes and Alexander Siddig. You might recognize some of these faces from US films & TV, but they are all well known in England.

  The stories are about the aftermath of a flawed rescue mission of an English business man on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq where two soldiers in their unit were killed. One man ends up being blamed & taking responsibility - discharged, disgraced & divorced.  The other becomes a war hero & promoted to a top position in the British government security services.  This is a story about Porter's quest for vindication and making things right.

The first story revolves around a kidnapping rescue again of a journalist whose father supported the invasion of Iraq and takes place outside Bazra. Porter returns to the special services because he recognizes one of the captors from a photo that the journalist took with her phone. There is action and some pretty dramatic scenes.  You will bite your fingers & sit on the edge of your seat. Suspenseful. Armitage & Brady really turn in great performances.

In the second story, now working for Collison, Porter is sent to rescue a captured assassin who tried to kill Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. It is apparent that both men are in danger and have to flee.  Shaun Parks who played the assassin described it as a 'bromance' or buddy film. Lots of action...of course Porter comes to the rescue.

The final story has a faster pace and takes place in Afghanistan and Pakistan,and it reminds me of something that might have come from Wikileaks.  There is an unstable English computer geek - redirected drones killing American troops - the CIA - MI-6 (English counterpart)- and an Iraqi terrorist group.  And guess what - for various reasons they all want Porter & the Computer geek dead.  This was an interesting story and highlighted the toll that conflict takes on men/women in the military. There are some really emotionally charged scenes in this one and Armitage really delivers an exciting performance.  Of course the question is do they both get away - and where to? Also who are the women in the burqas and what do they want? The pieces of the puzzle on who was at fault for the loss of the troups in 2003 are finally coming together--and what will happen when the story is out?

It was a great story with a hero you can count on. Armitage's Porter deserves another mission.

By the way, I bought our copy from Amazon UK (I have an all region player) in the regular format and not blue ray (hoping Santa will bring me one), but wished I did because the action and scenery would be even so much better.",1288396800,,4054,4.614206128133705
