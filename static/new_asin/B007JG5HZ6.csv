5091031,5,B007JG5HZ6,As a mystery buff I enjoy most all detective and mysteries.  I thought I'd try this Swedish mystery but with an English speaking cast .  Very good.,1349136000,,147,4.407407407407407
5091032,4,B007JG5HZ6,"It's sometimes unclear whether this series was inspired by product placement fees or appreciation of Henning Mankell's Wallander series, but it is handsome, Branagh is credible, and the generally free adaptations are not bad, as long as you're not too literal-minded.  Those devoted to the novels will miss significant plot elements, dozens of staff meetings, an unkempt apartment, dirty laundry, and a depressive but somehow wonderful man who eats terrible food and drinks too much - all replaced by worshipful shots of Volvos.  Possibly the best and longest car commercials ever made...",1348617600,5,588,5.380434782608695
5091033,5,B007JG5HZ6,"I am not the type of person who normally enjoys moody tv shows and movies. I was leery about the BBC Wallander series, with Kenneth Branagh playing the lead role of Kurt Wallander. I am so glad I made an exception when the series was presented on Public Television. I was hooked after the first episode.

I was thrilled when the series was released on DVD and I bought the set with 9 episodes from Amazon UK. Even though I have seen most of the episodes, a few times before, I am still enjoying them again. One of the plus sides of short-term memory loss is that I can watch my favorite shows over and over as I am doing with Wallander.

One of the best features of the series is the breathtaking scenery of southern Sweden. It adds a unique touch I haven't found in any other series outside of documentaries.

I am so glad Branagh agreed to play Wallander. I think he does a wonderful job of portraying the very complex character of Wallander.

I hope readers won't be put off by the negative reviews here. I think you will find this an outstanding series worth every penny you pay for it. I can't imagine any mystery lover not having a copy in their DVD collection.",1348531200,36,1167,4.339449541284404
5091034,3,B007JG5HZ6,"""Wallander"" Series 3 opens as Kurt Wallander is moving to his dream cottage in the country with girlfriend of two years Vanja (Saskia Reeves) and her young son Peter (Albert Maris). Outwardly, the detective hero of Henning Mankell's Swedish novels looks more settled. But he's still the same chronically depressive, extremely emotional man who cannot manage any detachment from his work, as we will see. The three episodes in Series 3 are ""An Event in Autumn"", based on a short story published only in the Netherlands entitled ""The Grave"", ""The Dogs of Riga"", based on the novel of the same name, and ""Before the Frost"", adapted from a novel in which Wallander's daughter Linda was the protagonist. This has been changed for the film, though Linda does make an appearance.

""Wallander"" is the most extreme melodrama I've ever seen on television, and it's wearing a bit thin for me. No one constantly in a state of such emotional distress could be a homicide detective. Henning Mankell has always crafted improbable, over-the-top plots, but his conspicuous reliance on implausible coincidences is lazy writing. While Kenneth Branagh is adequate in the role of Wallander, and more cuddly than the Swedish actors who have taken the role, which helps, the films hit only one note and stick with it: Wallander on an angst-fueled tear. Only in ""The Dogs of Riga"" is Wallander's angst interrupted by his disorientation. This series needs more along the lines of plot, or depth of character, or nuance, or anything that would engage the audience. The episodes are:

In ""An Event in Autumn"", Wallander moves with Vanja and Peter to an idyllic country cottage. He is soon interrupted by a call about a woman's body that washed up on the beach, in pieces, apparently the result of a ship's propeller from one of the ferries. Then Wallander's dog unearths a woman's skeleton in his new garden, the victim of a gunshot wound. The woman from the ferry is identified as Marinka Nowak (Paula Videniece), a Polish prostitute who worked in Sweden. But she was not on the passenger list. Efforts to identify the skeleton in the garden lead to a previous tenant, Jan Petrus (Con O'Neill), who ran prostitutes, but no easy answers. An improbable coincidence plays too great a role, and the motive for Marinka's murder, or if the death may have been an accident, is never clear.

The bodies of two murdered Latvian men float into Ystad harbor in ""The Dogs of Riva"". Their Russian mafia tattoos indicate a connection to organized crime. A narcotics investigator, Major Karlis Liepa (Sren Malling), arrives from Riga to claim the bodies. Liepa seems to recognize the men but is evasive. Wallander and Liepa are both interested in uncovering a drug smuggling route into Sweden, and Liepa returns to Riga to follow a lead. Wallander follows shortly after but finds himself in a strange culture, under surveillance by more than one party, without knowing whom to trust. Liepa's superiors, Colonels Jazeps Putnis (Arturs Skrastins) and Aleksandr Murnieks (Zoltan Butuc) seem suspicious to him. And Liepa's wife Baiba (Ingeborga Dapkunaite) seems to need his help.

""Before the Frost"" opens with a gruesome scene of swans being burned to death by a man named Jannek Langas (Paul Andrew Williams). When a hiker comes upon the scene, she meets a similar fate. That night, Anna Westin (Maimie McCoy), a childhood friend of Wallander's daughter Linda (Jeany Spark), shows up in a distressed state at the detective's home. But she flees and then disappears. Wallander traces a Bible found at the scene of the murder to Langas, a Danish paranoid schizophrenic and religious fanatic. But he is proving difficult to find, and Langas' taste for burning things in the name of God may not be confined to one man. It may have a connection to Anna. Again, an absurd coincidence is a major plot element.",1348444800,10,3860,4.9338461538461535
5091035,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Those who are ""bored to tears"" with Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Kurt Wallander probably have never read the books.  I would say his portrayal is as close as any Englishman can come.  I think you have to be a fan of Henning Mankell's brilliant books to fully appreciate what is being done here.  I do appreciate it, very much.",1348358400,37,328,4.52542372881356
5091036,4,B007JG5HZ6,"After a two or three year absence, emotionally-remote Swedish homicide detective Kurt Wallander (Kenneth Branagh) returns for a third season of three compelling feature-length mysteries, all adapted from the novels by Henning Mankell.

In AN EVENT IN AUTUMN, the detective finds the remains of a young woman buried behind his recently purchased house and soon discovers that her death is connected to the murder of another woman who was thrown off of a ferry.

THE DOGS OF RIGA begins when the bodies of two mobsters from Latvia wash up on Swedish shores, and Wallander is asked to travel to Riga in an effort to catch the killers.  What he finds, however, is a den of police corruption that he must expose in order to stay alive.

A friend of Wallander's estranged daughter comes to him for help in BEFORE THE FROST, and then disappears.  It's not long before it becomes apparent that she has become involved in a religious cult that employs arson as its primary weapon.

The performances in this trio of films are superb, as are the striking vistas in Sweden and Latvia against which he stories take place.

The 2-disc set is from BBC Video.

5091038,1,B007JG5HZ6,"Artists, even very good artists, make the mistake of believing they don't need independent criticism.

This is the worst thing I have ever seen Kenneth Branaugh in. His acting is fine, but the plot is on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon. So unbelievable, I couldn't finish watching the first episode. To add insult to injury, the action moves very slowly, with lots of closeups (of Branaugh, the big star, of course). So you have something that makes no sense, but takes a long time to do it.

5091058,3,B007JG5HZ6,"It's rare that anything starring Branagh disappoints, and this adaptation of the Swedish stories featuring Kurt Wallander is workmanlike and adequate but probably is best enjoyed by those who haven't first seen the excellent original Swedish version starring Krister Henriksson. For some reason English-language adaptations of Scandinavian noire fail to satisfy. The original trilogy of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was another example of an excellent original followed by a pale imitation made by big-name stars commanding high salaries yet lacking the essence of what made the originals so compelling.

Which is basically to say: if you've seen the Henriksson version, skip the Branagh version. There's nothing wrong with this English-language adaptation (provided you don't mind the awful garbling of Swedish names....) but there's nothing compelling about it either, whereas the original Swedish version is quite marvelous - perhaps because it's under-played, in contrast to the Branagh version where the director clearly felt he had to spoon-feed the audience by exaggerating every gesture, every ""dramatic"" moment, and every plot line. Doubtless this was made primarily for US screens and so subtlety was jettisoned in favor of ""See! See what he did! Look, we'll show you again!"" direction; the series would have been better if it had assumed, as did the original, that audiences don't need to be hit over the head.",1466208000,2,1424,5.414414414414415

5091079,4,B007JG5HZ6,"Well, like a well worn pair of shoes Wallander strolls back into our life and the series seems
immediately comfortable; just like Wallander, who has moved into a home with his girlfriend
in, ""An Event In Autumn"".

Now Wallander being Wallander there has to be something that puts a stop to that nonsense
of happiness and connubial bliss. It is a body of a dead girl in his yard. I have to say that is
one way to get my attention during the premiere of Season 3. Literally brings it right home.

Seems like a cold case, but is it? We are all use to twists and turns. We are used to it-is-not
what-it-seems plot development. Gloomy Wallander with his dogged pursuit of justice this
time emanates from his own back yard. It is an eerie start to a wonderful season.

""The Dogs of Riga"" has two corpses washing up on shore in Wallander's beat and this takes
Wallander to Riga Latvia. He works with the police and discovers more than he bargained for,
other than the killer.

You thought Sweden looked blue-cold but Latvia also has its cold side as Wallander has to
dodge his alleged allies to find the killer in a foreign land.

In the third episode, ""Before The Frost"",  a personal friend of Wallander's daughter asks for his
help and then disappears. Another spin on Wallander's life pulling and gnawing at him. There
is also another case about a elderly woman found in a shallow grave. This time it appears our
Protagonist only has so much time to catch the killer and, of course, help the daughter's friend.

It appears Wallander has his hands full again. I like all three stories. Each one is different but
using the old Wallander routines of duel cases, macabre entities, and Wallander getting up to
his personal eyeballs into the case.

I think that Branagh pulls it off again and wears it like a suit. The scripts are just as strong as
any of the previous episodes and it is to the credit of the cast, director, writers and cinematog-
rapher that they have a strong consistent Wallander-thread woven throughout the series.

There are no unusual twists or turns, just the usual twists and turns, but they are still pulled
off with bravado by Branagh and the cast. I gave it 4 Stars because in spite of the strong scripts,
acting and photography we learn nothing new about Wallander and it appears they may have
crested in character development.

Like a well worn pair of shoes this season is a comfort to experience and a pleasure to wear,
er, watch. This season is still worth watching even if for the comfort level it brings.",1440806400,,2529,4.5506607929515415

The first entry in this collection is An Event in Autumn, and it is one of the best in the whole series. Wallander is trying to build a relationship with a woman, after finally healing from his divorce. That provides a nice subplot as well as new location for the chilling crime story. Poor Wallander, gruesome murders have a way of finding him, even when he is at home. It is nice to see Wallander relating to a love interest; in one scene she helps him put on a new shirt and they just look at each other, smiling.

Both feature the endless countryside, the stark beaches and actually share some stories in common, the U.K. version is not as true to Mankell's Wallander, in both the staging and acting, in my opinion.

I did give this one a four star rating, but would give the Swedish version a ten plus rating.",1424390400,,456,4.604938271604938

I realize it's cultural -- I'm Norwegian and Swedish myself, through grandparents who were every bit as silent and sullen as Kurt Wallander. Maybe worse, come to think of it.  But really, is there no possibility at all for this man to enjoy anything?  I will  -- I know -- watch these programs again, and yes, I will watch any new one that come out.

But I do know what I like, and I not only like, but love this nifty BBC series based on what a New York Times writer derisively once called ""Swedish potboiler fiction"".LIke the ""Dragon Tattoo"" movie series, each Wallander episode is based on a single novel, and is really a self-contained film of its own. Yet there is an overall narrative arc, as well. Can anyone say ""Sherlock""? What makes this series so great is not just the great writing, not only the - and this is typical of BBC - the great photographic direction and haunting, slightly depressed Swedish coastal scenery, but, in two words: Kenneth Branagh. I mean,we knew this guy could act so the fact he is so good as the nominally dour homicide detective isn't surprising. What I would assert, though, is that Branagh MAKES this series. HIs facial expressions, line delivery everything he does on screen is pitch perfect.

5091227,4,B007JG5HZ6,"I have a like-dislike relationship with Wallander.  I like the acting and the setting.  Lovely shots of Sweden - some very artistic, dreamy and thought provoking.  The conflicted neurosis of the characters are well-defined and portrayed.  There's a definite Nordic cold desolation and loneliness feel to everyone's lives.  Plenty of existential angst to go around.  Communication doesn't come easy to anyone, least of all Wallander.  What I don't like is the graphic violence.  In this series there are a lot of deranged wackos running around with sharp implements and guns.  The gruesome factor does get to you.  But I forgive Wallander because there's a lot of Nordic beauty and clarity that shines through and makes this series worth watching.",1408665600,,746,5.19327731092437
5091228,5,B007JG5HZ6,The downside to finding a movie like Wallander and watching the series...  is that it comes to an end way to soon and you want more with no hope of getting them.  I have enjoyed this show immensely and will be sad to see to conclude.  I am down to my last show.  This is well worth watching.,1408665600,,291,3.9655172413793105

5091231,5,B007JG5HZ6,Outstanding acting in a mystery series that has twists and turns as the plot races to its conclusion. Sad that MHz International Mysteries are no longer able to be viewed on West Coast PBS stations. Absolutely gripping series that we do not see produced in the US.,1408147200,,264,4.638297872340425

5091234,4,B007JG5HZ6,Kenneth Branagh is almost like a chameleon in that he can immerse himself into a role so that all you can see is the character he is portraying.  We loved how he was able to morph into a Swedish character  who happened to be a police detective.,1407456000,,244,4.170212765957447

5091258,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Very dark in many ways - very moody and gloomy - not for everyone - the whole series is yet another triumph for Kenneth Branagh who gives a very low-key, restrained performance that results in a character presentation that is all the more powerful for it - you will watch the whole series if you watch one episode.  And you will remember it.",1405296000,,341,4.412698412698413

5091265,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Being a huge Wallander fan I had to add this to my collection of seasons 1 and 2, plus all of his books.  I totally enjoyed all three movies but had a question.  Doesn't the timeline for these stories place An Event in Autumn falls after The Dogs of Riga and Before the Frost?  I am going off memory of reading the books, so quite possibly I am mixed up on the order.

Notwithstanding my possible confusion, the movies were terrific and his character was spot-on with the books.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves the Wallander books and prior movies.",1404604800,,571,4.4
5091266,4,B007JG5HZ6,"This series is better done that most similar adapted-screenplay series, but it lacks the punch of the first six episodes (the first two seasons). The writing and characterizations were not as crisp, which gave the actors less to work with. The cinematography was still excellent, but I don't feel as though viewers are allowed into Wallender's mind as much as in the first two seasons. I liked the adaptation of ""The Dogs of Riga"" best of this trio.  Please note that the plot of the final Wallender book, which portrays Wallender's last case before he succumbs to early-onset dementia, is not included in this series.",1404345600,,618,4.885714285714286
5091267,4,B007JG5HZ6,I like this series very much.  It is raw and authentic.  Kenneth Branaugh is one of my favorite actors and he does not disappoint as Wallander.  For the faint of heart this series can get a bit too real and I find myself looking away or staring in shock.,1404000000,,254,4.142857142857143

5091269,4,B007JG5HZ6,"Wallender appears to be less than the swiftest detective in the world, but somehow gets the job done! The surrounding scenery does not exactly make me interested in visiting Sweden, its rather depressing sad to say ! But like many other detective series, these people go into houses/places where the last thing they think about is turning on a light!  What's with these guys, I wouldn't be going in most places without a light on in the first place...and a back-up team!",1403740800,,470,4.7317073170731705

5091273,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Branagh shines!  Great supporting cast, writers, direction, background.  Right up their w/Prime Suspect.  When the Europeans do drama and character studies they do it right. Highly recommended .",1403049600,,194,5.857142857142857
5091274,5,B007JG5HZ6,Took me awhile to get into the series but now I thoroughly enjoy it.  Getting into why he is who he is what took while and understanding his behavior helps to  make the show even more enjoyable.  Overall good story line.  Col,1402617600,,225,4.285714285714286
5091275,4,B007JG5HZ6,I give the series 4 stars because the stories are very good ( 5 stars ).  But the main character is always depressed and in a mental funk.  That detracts from the series somewhat.,1402444800,,179,4.235294117647059

5091281,3,B007JG5HZ6,"Beautiful scenery, shot very artistically and production values are high. If you value competence and clear thinking in your lead character Wallander is not your guy. He is a bit of a bumbler with occasional flashes of insight.",1401753600,,227,5.0
5091282,3,B007JG5HZ6,Wallander is himself a wreck.  Each mystery that falls on him takes him aback for awhile and then he gets up steam and moves at a snails pace to a resolution of the case.  It is interesting to watch him fall apart as things come together and by the end he is neither happy with the resolution or himself.  Much grittier than Midsomer Murders but enjoyable in is own suffering.,1401753600,,376,4.3428571428571425
5091283,4,B007JG5HZ6,Wallander is perhaps the best detective series that develops it's characters in many dimensions. The long episode format allows us to see the struggles this man goes through in Sweden.,1401667200,,184,5.166666666666667

5091305,4,B007JG5HZ6,"Branagh plays the hesitant intuitive detective Wallander amongst the terminally clouded and verdant landscape of southern Sweden.  OK, some episodes have snow. And sunshine. But it's not surprising he has a latent drink problem and a near zero score in meaningful communication within his personal relationships. But somehow the English accents, contorted plots and agonizingly slow process towards catching the perps, combined with consistently great camera work and gorgeous sound track combine to make this a truly compelling series. See them all.",1398729600,,550,5.7073170731707314

5091308,1,B007JG5HZ6,"I'm a fan of British tv mysteries, but don't bother with this series; it goes from bad to worse.  It's all about a self-righteous narcissist so preoccupied with his unknown dark thoughts that he is shockingly rude even or especially to those who might have thought they were, or should be, his ""loved ones.""  It's impressive to observe K. Branagh weep, but his character of Wallander only weeps for himself.  It's a downer with no redeeming qualities, in retrospect.  I've stopped watching near the end of episode 8, The Dogs of Riga, a dull story about this unattractive character who will only infuriate you.  I'm going to try the Swedish series.",1398211200,2,648,4.801801801801802

5091313,5,B007JG5HZ6,"The violence factor seems to be higher in this season, yet, the Wallander character has detective skills and feelings that he cannot seem to verbalize which makes for interesting relationships with those characters in both his work and personal life.  I found the Wallander character fascinating.  There are also differences between the American and Swedish police and judicial systems which aroused my interest.  After viewing all three available seasons, I am beginning a second viewing to catch further nuances within the program.  Thank you Amazon for making this program available at such a reasonable price.  (I will be looking out for other programs with Kenneth Branagh in them!  In my opinion, he is a fine actor.)  NOTE:  I may even look for the book series this program is based on.",1397692800,,793,5.046153846153846

There is a raw honesty to the character and a sensitivity that is not typical of the genre.",1397606400,,326,4.360655737704918
5091316,5,B007JG5HZ6,"The stories are plotted well and Wallander is a man whose pain is part of his relationship with colleagues and essential to our understanding of his reaction to and interaction with suspects, victims and all who come into the frame of the story. Depth in feeling and thought is woven into the fabric of the 'killing', and what is under the surface suffuses the slow and methodical work of ferreting out the bits and pieces of information that lead to capture and conclusion.

Branagh is a brilliant actor who conveys his world, one of pain and hurt, of confusion and the layers of understanding and no understanding at all of the world in which we live, of the life of ""Everyman"" that is, in fact, each and every one of us.
Wallander is Swedish mystery at its best.",1397347200,,765,4.543478260869565

In episode 1 Kurt starts a new phase of life with a new house and relationship which quickly take a dark turn when the remains of a body are found in the yard. Episode 2, The Dogs of Riga, is set largely in Latvia with Kurt investigating the death of a colleague with whom he was jointly investigating the death of a young woman who fell/was pushed from a ferry. In Episode 3 losses in Kurt's personal relationships are counterbalanced by a happy family development. On the whole, Kurt looks less disheveled and seems healthier emotionally than in prior seasons - a welcome adjustment to his existential angst.",1397088000,,647,4.538461538461538
5091320,4,B007JG5HZ6,"The authentic feel of the countryside and small town atmosphere makes for compelling drama, You are seldom distracted by the chaos of the big city and large crowds. Instead you can soak in the story while Kurt is doing his dramatic best at being depressed and doggedly tired--still ever consumed with putting pieces together that seem very wrong. The story of horrific murders with no motives and suspects leads Wallander to a cult practicing bizarre rituals and a dead man not so dead.",1396915200,,486,4.867469879518072
5091321,4,B007JG5HZ6,"We enjoyed the series.  Each of the shows had a complicated, but understandable, murder plot that really kept my attention.  The only negative is that the main actor's role showed him as having such a negative personality -- depressed, compulsive, and not any fun.  It was OK at first, but after several episodes, that sour disposition was hard to take.  And he always looked unkempt.  But I think that's typical of British offerings compared to US-made shows.",1396828800,,460,4.922077922077922

Branagh combines the almost perfect mixture of intelligence and emotion to create a Wallander that is sometimes compassionate and sometimes brutal. He does the role so well I often wonder if this is the real Kenneth Branagh just being himself. The plots most times are original and if not original they are produced in a fresh way. This is an outstanding British Television production that rivals if not surpasses the original Swedish series.

Make me smile, is like a slow motion, they don't have something better to do? or is because the people ask how they get to that place? I like.

5091368,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Kenneth Branagh returns as moody Swedish police detective Kurt Wallander in the BBC production ""Wallander 3.  Season three adapts three more of Henning Mankill's excellent detective stories, filmed on location in Sweden with primarily a British cast.  The roughly 90 minute episodes are well-executed and suspenseful, with intricate plots.

The first story is ""An Event in Autumn"" in which Kurt's plan to move into a lovely little farmhouse with his girlfriend is disrupted by the discovery of a body in the garden.  The discovery of a second body on a beach leads Wallander on a chase first after the leader of a prostitution ring, then after a faceless serial killer whose identity is in doubt for the viewer until the final minutes.

In the second story, ""The Dogs of Riga"", the discovery of the mutilated corpses of two Russian mob members at sea brings a visit by a Latvian police detective.  When the detective is murdered upon his return to Latvia, Kurt is drawn into a maze of corruption and murder in the Baltic City of Riga. The search for evidence in the detective's murder will leave Kurt with a potentially lethal dilemma: whom to trust in a former police state.  The plot for both the book and this episode seems implausible at times, but the drama and suspense are worth it.

In the final episode, Kurt Wallander is reunited  with his daughter Linda, in a case that involves a schoolmate of Linda, now missing.  Kurt finds a long trail of clues leading through several murders and arsons to an unpredictable group of extremists.  The answer may lie with the wife of an old friend.

These BBC productions seem always to stir a bit of controversy, either for the way they are adapted from the novels, or how they differ from the Swedish versions of the same stories.  This reviewer's advice is to enjoy them on their own terms, as quality television drama.  The Swedish scenery certainly does not hurt the production values.  It helps to understand the characters if the viewer has seen earlier seasons or has read at least a couple of the novels.  Recommended.",1389657600,,2074,4.76750700280112

5091383,5,B007JG5HZ6,Henning Mankell is one of my favorite writer.  I love the Wallander character.  Love the PBS series! Looking forward to the next and final episodes.,1388361600,,148,4.88

5091386,5,B007JG5HZ6,"I have enjoyed all Seasons of the Wallander series.  The story line is gripping. Few actors are capable of immersing themselves into a character like Kenneth Branagh.

5091387,3,B007JG5HZ6,"This is a superbly cast, written, directed, and acted series...cinematography excellent.  However, the story lines are so dark and depressing that it gets hard to watch.  I left it in the beginning of an episode which sees a man luring geese to feed near a full gas can, then setting them all afire...probably something a madman might do, but still (for me) too much gratuitous violence against innocent animals.",1387670400,,412,4.956521739130435

Superb.",1387238400,,320,5.018867924528302

5091394,4,B007JG5HZ6,Good story lines with lots of action.  Plots usually take a turn that you never see coming.  Enjoyed this series set in Scandinavia.,1385683200,,132,4.695652173913044

5091397,5,B007JG5HZ6,This is a great series.  The lead actor is brilliant.  The movies are filmed in Sweden which adds immeasurably to the tone and atmosphere of the films.,1385251200,,151,4.555555555555555
5091398,3,B007JG5HZ6,"I would have given this a better rating because the acting and story is good, but overall it is too depressing as a series.  Every episode Wallander has some horrible experience he feels responsible for.  It is too blue for me.",1385078400,,227,4.512195121951219

5091401,5,B007JG5HZ6,"These shows are great. Great scenery. Great acting. Compelling story lines. Mankel just knows how to keep you wondering what's going to happen next. And it never fails, at close to the end of each story, there is a twist. His writing - the script - is really, really good, which I attribute to a certain subtleness in the dialogues. And the Swedish setting (combined with the ethos of the local characters) is haunting and is its own character without which you'd believe the story was missing something. Of course, no one else should play the main role other than Branagh. He is pitch perfect. I wish there were more episodes.",1384646400,,627,4.657657657657658

5091404,5,B007JG5HZ6,as a fan of mankell's work (dark as it often is) -- I found the interpretation beautifully done.  branagh is perfect in the title role and the supporting cast is superb.  the amazon prime streaming was clear and even had closed caption capabilities which really help.,1383091200,,267,4.782608695652174
5091405,1,B007JG5HZ6,"I like the series overall, but the Wallander character is so weak and pathetic, you wonder why he still has a job.  He would do better as an advisor or something since he is so gun shy. For example, he and his female partner are being attacked by vicious dogs and he tells her not to shoot. He lets a madman hit his partner in the head with a sledgehammer as he stands there with a stupid look on his face. Good crime series with a very weak cop as the lead. He solves all the crimes, but he is just so pathetic.",1382918400,3,512,3.970873786407767
5091406,5,B007JG5HZ6,"This show is one of my favorites - the main character is wonderfully acted by Kenneth Branagh, who is one of the best actors today.  The show does not focus on flashy/trashy, it's just absolutely well written, well acted, and leaves me wanting to see more!",1382572800,,256,4.565217391304348

5091410,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Never having seen any BBC shows, it has been a treat viewing several via Amazon Prime streaming. The Wallander series, all three seasons that are available, are excellent crime drama. There is complexity in the story lines, keeping ones' attention through each episode.  I recommend viewing Season 3 as well as the first and second seasons if you enjoy crime drama.  The flashy fast paced actions of Hollywood dramas is absent, allowing one to focus on the mysteries themselves.",1381795200,,478,5.037974683544304
5091411,5,B007JG5HZ6,I really enjoyed watching all the episodes and wish there were more. I'll miss watching Wallander and crew and will be on the lookout in case they decide to film more.,1381708800,,167,4.419354838709677
5091412,5,B007JG5HZ6,"I am a huge fan of the Wallander series and would highly recommend. In addition to the BBC 3-series set (IMDB notes a new season is coming in 2014) starring Mr. Branagh, the two Swedish versions are also excellent in their own right). The writing, the acting and the production values for the BBC series are really worth your investment. Branagh is a very versatile actor and he really puts in a bravura performance here as well. I recently purchased the book for Henning Mankell's Faceless Killers and would highly recommend. I plan to try to work my way through the books as well.",1381708800,,582,4.605769230769231
5091413,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Great writing, intense mystery, superb acting!  The scenery was filmed to perfection, the music added a comfort, and the lead character is subtle, smart, and too human for his own sake.  A nearly perfect show!  Please continue this series and until it is continued I'll watch again and again.",1381708800,,292,4.918367346938775
5091414,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Wallander is a bit of an enigmatic Detective and I can only guess at how hard it was to interpret the wonderful character from the novel to film. I know many will find the quiet and introspective Detective to be a little less than the normal flashy detectives we see today. I, however , think it is refreshing to have an imperfect Detective who is introspective and quiet yet brilliant. All of Henning Mannkell's books I find to be great reads and to have Kenneth Branagh bring Wallander to life is a real blessing. Loved all three season's and can only hope that more will come our way.",1381190400,,587,4.444444444444445

5091416,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Wallander is so committed to his job.  He's an awesome detective, so much so that he has a hard time with his regular life.  He can't let go of the grief he feels and that affects his personal relationships.",1380844800,,207,4.282051282051282
5091417,4,B007JG5HZ6,"As all Wallander episodes, it was a little gloomy, somewhat depressing.  Wonderful acting.  I love the fact that it was actually filmed in Sweden, though British accents can be a bit distracting at times.  Perhaps a bit bloodier than Season 1 and Season 2, the stories were compelling and really stick with you.  Not forgettable like so much of TV.",1380326400,,348,4.75
5091418,5,B007JG5HZ6,"I have enjoyed each Wallender film.  Having read all the books, I'm Saddened there will be no more.  If you like the films, I know you would love his books.  Don't miss out on the wonderful reading experience.",1380067200,,209,4.447368421052632

5091420,5,B007JG5HZ6,I love all of the Wallander seasons and I am looking for more.  Wallander is a complicated character and not one dimensional.  Being from the US it is interesting to view people portrayed from other countries.  It is refreshing to see law enforcement from another point of view working towards the same end.  Catching the bad guy.,1379721600,,330,4.7368421052631575
5091421,4,B007JG5HZ6,"The Branagh stories are very well-written and told.  Branagh is not as good a Wallander as Krister Henriksson (IMHO).  He is too crushed velvet.  But the stories are still excellent, and the setting is hard to beat.  Also, most of the Branagh episodes are prequels to the Heriksson ones, so you are not watchig the same thing twice if you choose to watch both series (which i highly recommend you do).",1379721600,,401,4.605633802816901
5091422,5,B007JG5HZ6,All anyone ever seems to do in Sweden is drive endlessly across beautiful (but cold) scenery. Kenneth Branagh does it all day long. Then he finds a murder witch leads him to existential angst which leads him to the solution. And the nicest thing is that you can't guess the killer (as you can in every damn American detective show) by picking out the first speaking character who is not on the regular cast.  It's complex and involving and beautifully shot.,1379462400,,457,4.6419753086419755
5091423,4,B007JG5HZ6,"Great acting, well written, but don't watch if you are depressed.  You have to feel sorry for Kurt in this show as he never seems to get a break.",1379030400,,145,4.0

5091425,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Way to go!  Every episode is worth a re-watch.  No wham, bam, no silly violence and no heroics except our beloved aging and no nonsense detective figuring things out with secrets openly shared during the episode.  A la Agatha Christie style!!

5091429,5,B007JG5HZ6,Kenneth Branagh provides an intense performance. The stories are excellent and the photography is beautiful. Although it makes one think that Sweden is nothing but old farm houses and gravel roads!,1377907200,,197,5.387096774193548
5091430,5,B007JG5HZ6,"After watching Wallander's 1st two seasons, was eager to see the third. It didn't disappoint. Great stories, amazing characters and what lifts this program above many-extraordinary acting. Without speaking a line, Kenneth Branagh conveys how a genius detective, who has seen death first hand so frequently he is in a perpetual depressed state. Despite attempts to leave his job as a cop, his skills are needed and he is pulled back in to solve one gruesome crime after another. His job leaves him little time for a personal life and  he deals with the effects of his devotion to work. He has a string of broken relationships. More troubling to him is the work has caused him to disappoint his family over and over. Adding to Wallander's woes, he has trouble sleeping because it impossible to block out the horror he sees regularly. The cast of actors involved is first rate. Can't wait till season 4!!!!",1377734400,,903,4.788461538461538
5091431,4,B007JG5HZ6,"Kenneth Branagh is Wallander, forget the other pretenders. He has this Shakespearian presence  - think King Lear. His father is always there to give him a good kick while he is down.",1377734400,,182,4.6875
5091432,4,B007JG5HZ6,The earlier Wallanders seem better plotted but the acting writing and above all Branagh save this even with a particularly pat and rushed ending.,1377734400,,145,5.083333333333333
5091433,4,B007JG5HZ6,It was a good series but the man needed some R and R his tasks we tiring...hahaha but it was a change from the hum drum stuff we see or try not to be force to see...,1377561600,,165,3.4864864864864864
5091434,5,B007JG5HZ6,Unusual series that was very interesting with plenty of twists in the plots.  Guess USA is not the only place with lots of weirdos.,1377388800,,131,4.458333333333333
5091435,5,B007JG5HZ6,Great acting. Great progression. Unrushed and confident of the importance of its story (unlike every show made for US audiences). Great adaptation from the books. Wallander is quality at every level. Far exceeds expectations for a third season and is even better than seasons 1 & 2.,1377216000,,282,5.0212765957446805
5091436,5,B007JG5HZ6,"The plots of the murder investigations aren't really up to par, but by now Branagh's Wallender character and his family and circle are fully developed Nordic brooders, searching for meaning in their lives.",1377129600,,205,5.242424242424242
5091437,4,B007JG5HZ6,"The show ended well, with resolution on the final show with his daughter. I hate he's such a lonely person. Still wish he didn't cry so much.

Probably don't ever want to go live in his country. Good show, though.",1377043200,,363,4.352941176470588

5091440,5,B007JG5HZ6,Kevin Branagh is terrific as Wallander.  i enjoy this series on PBS so it is great to have my own copies and I won't need to wait for the show to rerun.,1376870400,,152,3.75
5091441,5,B007JG5HZ6,I started watching Wallander simply because I am a huge fan of Kenneth Branagh. After the first episode I was instantly hooked Branagh is engaging and enigmatic. The show is well written and I am not easy to please being in the law enforcement profession myself. The cast of supporting characters are all very talented. The scenery of Sweden is very beautiful and becomes another character that grabs a hold of you and won't let go. I can't do this show justice with a description you have to watch it for yourself. If you like crime dramas like I do I promise you will enjoy it.,1376438400,,579,4.471698113207547
5091442,3,B007JG5HZ6,"Branagh is an accomplished actor, but in the two episodes that I watched, his character went nowhere and the unrelieved moping of the detective never rises to acute observation, clever wit, or even dark humor. The horrors that people find themselves doing to others are worthy studies for a detective series, and the police who have to work daily with these horrors cannot but feel some effect upon their view of the human condition. But moping around without comment or irony is just to self-indulgent for my tastes. Oddly enough, interviews with witnesses and interrogations of suspects are pursued very indifferently, often with the detective walking away with little new information. This behavior stretches out the mystery, and may reflect a sad reality of the profession; on the upside it gives space to speculate about the next move the story might take. Whether it is the fault of the writers, though, or the exhaustion of the actor, I have lost interest in watching more episodes.",1376352000,,989,5.0
5091443,5,B007JG5HZ6,We see continued development of Wallander in this season.  The stories continue to be interesting and engaging. Branagh provides another terrific performance this season.  Quality through Amazon was great!,1376352000,,205,6.0344827586206895
5091444,5,B007JG5HZ6,This ranks as one of the best shows I have ever watched. Kenneth Branagh is such a talented actor...he gave such emotion to the character of Kurt Wallander. I highly recommend this watching all three seasons.,1376265600,,208,4.805555555555555

5091451,5,B007JG5HZ6,"I really like the lead detective in this series. He's well-played by Kenneth Branagh. Some of the character's personal story is a little thin, such as him suddenly moving in with a woman and her son, and then just as suddenly, they are no longer together, but otherwise, it's a really good detective show, and the first I've seen in that country's setting.",1375056000,,356,4.666666666666667
5091452,3,B007JG5HZ6,"Before I found the Kindle PRIME streaming Swedish version of the same series, I thought that Branagh's Wallander was OK:  Branagh plays Wallander almost without affect and his character seems slovenly, but the settings were beautiful and foreign.  But after watching Krister Henriksson and the rest of the Swedish cast, I ""got"" Wallander.  He's a functioning depressive and at worst, frumpy but he's definitely got pheromones. Krister's mind is razor sharp and impatient while Branagh's Wallander seems to wallow in asocial misery until he has an ah-ha! detective moment.  Lots of world weary staring in the English Wallander while the Swedish Wallander brings the dog to work and has convivial whiskeys with others, albeit in a tired, moody, I-like-opera kind of way.  Branagh's Wallander has next to no success interpersonally while Henriksson's Wallander delegates and interacts as a respected, isolated superior and concerned father. One just keeps suffering psychologically while the other focusses on his work to distract himself from loneliness. I'm afraid that Branagh's Wallander brings out the worst in the detective while Henriksson's finds the best.",1375056000,,1161,5.5

The stories are bleak, filled with a lot of mundane events, but the pacing is good and the culprits are not always obvious.

I recommend the entire series.",1374624000,,365,4.854838709677419

Of course, you have to like detective stories -who done its- with violence mostly finding dead bodies and an investigator who has personal problems with his family and emotional response to not saving the victims.
Another feature is the locations.  The victims are found mostly in Sweden, one in Riga, and some bodies float ashore because the series is set in Sweden.  I think it adds to the flavor.",1374451200,,573,4.533980582524272

Kenneth Branagh and the whole of the cast act very well and the cinematography is wonderful with nuances of wheat field blowing in the wind something you are not likely to find on Law and Order Stockholm (if there were one:).  Wallander is the obsessed ""dogooder"" we all pretend to be, justice is his breakfast, lunch and dinner.  His personal relationships fall apart as result and we can see it all unfold before us.  We all know in our own lives obsession of any sort seems to kill and relationship so we can relate and even feel his pain.  There is a bit of Poirot or Colombo is all this too which will likely captivate people like me in the over 40 group:)  As I watch it i always have my eye out for Lisbeth Salander aswell, enjoy!!!",1373500800,,970,4.244565217391305

The stories were somewhat less compelling, and there was little connection to the previous series. The scenery was still beautiful, and the cinematography superb in the outdoor scenes, but the onslaught of winter added an overall feeling of gloom, and the replacement team had less synergy than the original one. I missed Tom Hiddleston's part - all the new team is clearly ""reporting to"" Wallander, where the ongoing previous tension between Wallander and Magnus brought another layer of interest to the previous series.

5091530,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Taken right out of the BBC Masterpiece Mystery this season of Wallander features three completely different mysteries with Wallander challenged to solve the crimes.  Wallander to me seems to be a different sort of police detective as he is low key, methodical and he tries to be in tune with the victims and at times even the killers.

This is a two disk set of DVDs that features three stories:

* An Event In Autumn - Wallander moves into a new home and as he lets out his dog in the late evening the dog finds a buried skeleton on the back of his property.  Wallander has to investigate the history of the house and try to find out who the body is and how they died.  As he digs into the case he finds a link to another crime and he begins to think that he may have a serial killer on the loose....

* The Dogs Of Riga - A rubber boat washes ashore with bodies in it that have been killed Russian mob style.  Their mouths are burned out by acid as a sign they were informants who talked.  Wallander has to go to the city of Riga in Latvia as the only contact he has in that country for the case was just brutally murdered in the same way as the two men in the rubber boat.  He finds a culture of crime and police corruption that may just get him killed....

* Before The Frost - A woman who was the friend of Wallander's daughter shows up late one night and is asking for his help.  As Wallander turns his back the girl disappears.  Days later Wallander is called in on a bizarre murder that also involves the killing of some swans.  Evidence leads to the fact that a religious zealot who is a pyromaniac and a known institution patient is in the area and may be part of a religious cult.....

My wife and I enjoyed every one of these shows and they were entertaining and good mystery stories.  Kenneth Branagh played the role of Wallander and while he plays a different sort of role of a police officer that we are used to seeing on American TV he is very good as an actor.  The surrounding cast is also very good and the storylines were good mystery stories.  The only thing that bothered me a little was that there were so many links to Wallander's home and family and the coincidences were almost too much.  I overlooked it as I enjoyed each of the stories but it is evident. The stories are quite violent and at times the scenes can be macabre so be warned if that is not your type of film or story.

I enjoyed the first two seasons very much and was suprised when I recently found a new season on Amazon.  I fast forwarded through the animal immolation scenes in the last of the three episodes, because I just cannot bear to even imagine innocent animals being hurt but I was fully engaged from beginning to end of each episode with that one exception.

5091539,2,B007JG5HZ6,"A great show comes to a sputtering end.

The Wallander series was made great by genius story conception, talented actors, direction with a keen sensibility, extraordinary camera work, music and sound that breathed and: the writing sputters, dies, and stinks up the work in the 3rd show of the season.

the writing in the first season was extraordinary, and the second season kept pace.

This third season seemed disconnected. The first two shows remained true to the core but the meta story line, the development of Wallander as a human being was not full filled.

Worse, the writing in the last show is trite and full of cliches and political correctness. It lacks the subtleties, the shades of grey between evil and goodness of the other seasons.

In season one and two the writing was superb and artfully restrained. The viewer was left to ponder the big questions of life. Season three irritates with its bullying tone.

Given the story topic of faith within Christian fundamentalism they choose the blatant politically correct and pushed it forward at every moment. It is obvious the writers are narrow minded bigots without understanding. They are so far away from church culture they see it like mountains against the sunset, a single black shadow. The writing has no depth or color.

The director, actors, production et al, struggle with a stinker and do their part. But regardless of their effort the writing sours the show.",1357516800,3,1433,4.921161825726141
5091540,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Branaugh's version of the spiritually-drained, emotionally unavailable, malnourished Wallander is easy to care about and, for me, easy to resonate with his passion. His girly ringtone, and his unshaven face return this season for another round of murders. True the high number of exotically gruesome slayings seems rather implausible, but it's worth the suspension of disbelief to enjoy the quality writing, acting, and visual style. I like it that this set of stories takes place away from the boring set of the police station and the Riga story is the best Wallander episode so far. Best if you have seen Series 1 and 2 already, but mostly understandable on their own without the context of Series 1 and 2.",1357171200,3,708,4.957983193277311

On the one hand, Branagh seems perfect for the lead role -- his emotions kept in check until compulsion overcomes control and he snaps. All the supporting actors are well cast as well, and their performances excellent. The direction is exquisite, and the mood a mix of patient endurance and tense expectation. And all these things -- the characters, the setting, the mood -- are enough to offset what is for me plot lines that hinge too much on coincidence, chance and oversight. If you need your story to be seamless and air tight, this disc will probably make you tear your hair out. If, on the other hand, you are drawn to atmosphere and character, this will be a very nice ride. The choice, as they say, is yours to make.",1355443200,,878,4.459627329192546

Thanks to Amazon, we could keep on watching  as Kurt Wallander (Kenneth Brannagh) has more success unravelling the intricate cases he is assigned to than to sort out his personal life. The order of the stories is different from the original release dates of the books, but the scripts and charact development are well adapted to take this into account.
And oh, the haunting music!
We are looking forward to Wallender 4 ... and 5 ... and 6 ...",1352505600,,552,4.63265306122449
5091556,4,B007JG5HZ6,"Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Kurt Wallander is quite different to his two Swedish predecessors, Rolf Lassgrd and Krister Henriksson. The Branagh adaptations are much more focused on Wallander than the Swedish ones which give more promince to the other members of the investigating team. The Lassgrd versions are much closer to the actual books than the Branagh ones. The private life of Wallander is as it is in the books in the Lassgrd versions whereas the Branagh versions have changed some of the events, switched the order in which they happened or left them out altogether.
It was a good surprise to see Danish actor Sren Malling appear in the second mystery ""The Dogs of Riga"", a story which when written in the early 1990s seemed to be an accurate portrayal of Riga at the time, but twenty years later, this 2011 attempt at the story makes it seem that Riga is still stuck in 1991. Malling will be known to viewers of BBCFour Danish series The Killing and Borgen. It seems that he is the only character who correctly pronounces Wallander unlike all the others including Wallander himself.
Having the characters speak in English, but with POLIS, Vardagsrum among other Swedish words displayed on various uniforms, boxes etc, it seems odd that handwritten messages are then written in English. This leads me to the belief that surely the BBC would have been better giving Branagh another role in a UK based series which would have been cheaper to produce and more conventional than having a UK cast play Swedes speaking in English, reading English but being situated among notices and signs in Swedish. This is particularly more annoying when there are already two sets of Wallander stories already made in Sweden using Swedish actors speaking in Swedish which BBCFour have also screened the majority of with English subtitles to decent sized audiences.
Maybe I prefer the pure form in the SVT and TV4 versions. Having said that TV4 who had a hand in the Henriksson versions are part of the financing for the Branagh versions too and seem to enjoy decent ratings when they screen in Sweden with Swedish subtitles.
The next series will be the last and will consist of ""The White Lioness"" and ""The Troubled Man"", the latter will be a two part story.
One benefit of the Branagh versions is that they have helped open up the Wallander novels to a wider readership than would have exisgted had the Branagh versions not been made, so in that respect I'm happy.

5091564,4,B007JG5HZ6,"I'm a great fan of Scandinavian crime authors such as Henning Mankell, Karin Fossum, Jo Nesbo, and more. It is interesting that all three of the mentioned authors have male protagonists that frequently struggle with their inner demons, some more than others, but all have this thread of a tormented soul weaved into their individual lives. For Fossum, it is Inspector Sejer, and for Nesbo, it is Harry Hole. In terms of dramatization though, we only have Wallander for company, at least for the present.

In Collection 3, viewers are treated to three feature length dramas, i.e. ""An Event in Autumn"", ""The Dogs of Riga"", and ""Before the Frost"". I admit I did not much care for ""An Event in Autumn"", but I enjoyed the other two. Kenneth Branagh shines in his role as the tormented and depressed Wallander,  though I would like to see more focus on the plot as well as the other characters. Those who have been watching this series will understand when I say that the point about Wallander's troubled soul has been hammered home one too many times, and can get a little tedious at times.

The production qualities are amazing as always and a treat to watch. Those who like crime dramas with well-developed characters will enjoy this. At the time of writing, this DVD is not available in Blu-Ray format but the audio is clear and the images are well-defined and crisp, though not quite as sharp as those found in HD versions. I was only interested in the dramatization in terms of plot and character development and I felt Wallander 3 did a good job on those fronts.

Season Three appeared on the BBC this past July and consists of the interpretations of Swedish author Henning Mankell's novels ""An Event in Autumn,"" ""The Dogs of Riga,"" and ""Before the Frost.""

Wallander shows determination, insight, and courage in solving brutal murders, often going above and beyond duty to solve the crimes, all the while dealing with complicated family relationships in his private life.  The stories are well-written and some episodes in the series even provide the viewer insights into current Swedish society.  And as with the first two seasons, the scenery of Sweden (and in this season, Latvia) significantly adds to the enjoyment of the series.

8518326,5,B007JG5HZ6,"Wallander is a British television series adapted from the detective novels of the acclaimed Swedish crime author Henning Mankell. Wallander is essentially a combination of a detective procedural and a personal drama, the first iteration of which is a Swedish language version with English subtitles. The story line is centered around Kurt Wallander, who is depicted as a tired and troubled veteran Swedish homicide detective, whose personal life is completely dysfunctional, and who seems to be suffering from elements of severe job stress, burnout, and PTSD. He has recently separated from his wife, and he has a complicated relationship with his adult daughter, who often comes across as the supervisory parent, rather than the child, in her interactions with her father. Although Kurt Wallander has been known to look scruffy and disheveled, and often displays an extremely volatile demeanor, his unkempt appearance and his obvious emotional distress belie his exceptional investigative skills and acumen. When he is able to focus, Kurt Wallander is a masterful detective, who is hyper-observant, systematic, and methodical, with an uncanny ability to solve complicated homicide cases. In this third season, Detective Kurt Wallander takes two out-of-country investigative trips, a ferry ride across the Baltic Sea to Poland, and then a plane trip to Riga, Latvia, in search of evidence relating to several intriguing murder cases. Tragedy strikes again, when his cherished partner, Anne-Britt Hoglund, suffers a severe blow to the head, resulting in a devastating traumatic brain injury, during the course of a seemingly routine property search. Unfortunately, his difficulty with interpersonal communication, and his inability to adequately express his feelings, both chronic problems, have adversely affected his relationship with his lady friend, Vanja Andersson, causing her to terminate their relationship, and move out. However, there is a very touching scene at the end of the third episode of Season 3, in which Detective Kurt Wallander accompanies his daughter, Linda, for her first obstetric ultrasound, and he lovingly marvels at the sonographic image of his future first grandchild. Wallander is characterized by excellent writing and plot development, with murder mysteries that are exceedingly complex, gripping, and suspenseful, replete with many interesting twists. Kenneth Branagh delivers an absolutely outstanding performance with his brilliant portrayal of Detective Kurt Wallander, and the acting performances of the supporting cast are also stellar. Wallander is a decidedly intelligent, engaging, and entertaining detective series from BBC America, which certainly merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1499904000,2,2760,5.783783783783784
