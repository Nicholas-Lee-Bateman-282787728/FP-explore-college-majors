587986,5,6303113192,"One of the best.  I've read the critics' reviews of Sam Shepard's directorial effort, hogwash. If you don't like what Shepard did in this one, you've missed the point of the movie.  You can't roller-skate in a buffalo herd! There are two tragedies to this film: one, it has gone so unnoticed as a whole; two, Sheila Tousey has gone so unnoticed. I believe this is the greatest Native American actress. Couple this with Mr. Bates, Harris, Mulroney, Pheonix, Shepard and Ms. Arredondo, and it was a loser in any way??????",1076889600,19,519,4.6923076923076925
587987,3,6303113192,"As a true fan of River Phoenix I approach any film he's done with an incredibly open mind - maybe moreso than I should. Silent Tongue is a beautifully scripted and written Western revolving around a young man's loss of a loved one. Phoenix actually has only a dozen or so lines - with his silence though, he speaks volumes. His absorbtion of this character is flawless and eerily truthful. Richard Harris is wonderful here as in everything he does. His part is also not very wordy. In fact much of the film is wihtout dialogue. This creates a wonderful sense of the isolation of that era. It also allows the characters to be explored introspectively and with great depth. The true test of an actor is if he can embody the character with no lines; existing solely with his very being. Here River shows sheer perfection; conveying painfully his character's torment with only his body and his eyes!
However, this is where my praise for the film stops. Though it must have been an amazingly beautiful story to read, much was lost in translating it to film. Dermot Mulrooney has a large role. He botches it masterfully by grunting/shouting all his lines as though trying to reach predominately deaf people in the back row of a Theater he's not in. The effect is that none of what he says sounds honest, but more like a experimental, high school drama class failure. This is sad because in every other film I've seen him, he does a solid acting job worthy of much notice. There are also several scenes which are unnecessarily drawn out and campy. And as someone who loves the 1956 classic ""Giant"" which runs 3 1/2 hours, it takes a lot for me to call any scene in a Western drawn out.
Sam Shephard, Writer and Director of Silent Tongue, has produced dozens of brilliant plays etc. But to bring this story to life on film would have required much more attention to Cinematic effect than was given. Some things can captivate one reading a script, but simply don't hold up on the 'silver screen'. Even as an ""artsy"" film [A genre` which I LOVE], this doesn't quite achieve the goal. Nonetheless, one walks away from this film moved and touched - not only by River's brilliance, but also in realizing the magnitude of the story and message that must have inspired this film. And so even with its absurd moments and unfortunately wretched performance by Mulrooney, this is still a film I recommend for some. For Richard Harris and River Phoenix's performances more than make it worth a look.",1006041600,9,2480,4.613122171945701
587988,5,6303113192,"Sam Shepard, the writer/director of ""Silent Tongue,"" is one of the big names in contemporary American theatre.  So it comes as no surprise that his two feature films--also, ""Far North""--have a distinctly theatrical tone.  General audiences may not have a taste for this, but Shepard's films do reward additional viewings, and both have grown on me in a big way.

 ""Silent Tongue"" is a ghost story which uncovers a disturbing sickness at the heart of the Old West.  River Phoenix becomes mentally unhinged when his Native American bride dies in childbirth.  This sends his father, Richard Harris, on a journey to try and find another woman for his son.  Exhibiting tragically limited imagination, the father returns to the traveling circus where he traded horses for the first woman, and he attempt a second bargain for the woman's sister.  In the end, the sister must confront the dead woman's ghost, and we learn the dark secret of their past.

 Phoenix is eerily convincing as the mad Talbot Roe, and Richard Harris is uncharacteristic low-key as the world-weary Prescott Roe.  My only complaint is Dermot Mulroney who is miscast and unable to make his character's diction convincing.",974851200,26,1186,5.030769230769231

588079,1,6303113192,"Silent Tongue, 1996 film

This story is set in 1873 (the time of an economic depression). We see objects suspended from a tree. A man site before a campfire, then fires a shot at a bird. A man rides a horse leading three horses. He stops to watch a traveling show camped on the plains. [This is like padding.] A young woman on a horse does trick riding. They the performers promote a patent medicine. [Can they do enough business to support that cast?] That rider says his wife has died, the child too. His son suffers from an illness, his mind is gone. He offers three horses for the man's daughter. The horses are inspected. Later we see a young man in the night. Native Americans visit him. [This is incomprehensible to me.]

In the morning that young woman is abducted. They show a canal as if this means something. [This scene is phone, horses did not like camels because of their smell and appearance.] A new audience shows up, three men throw rocks at the entertainers. [They should blame the movie's producers. Staging scenes on a prairie keeps costs down as needed for a low budget production.] There is talk about suicide. ""Do it!"" Two shots end this scene. The movie runs on. The dark scenes say ""low budget"", no need for expensive sets (as if they knew it would be a flop). The young woman makes a deal.

By this time I decided I had enough. If your tastes are like mine you won't like it either.",1378512000,,1408,4.407692307692308
588080,3,6303113192,"Irishman Richard Harris played a Western adventurer many times, including the successful A Man Called Horse franchise. In Silent Tongue he's the patriarch of a family so dysfunctional that he has to buy wives for his son, played by River Phoenix (the first wife dies and the second one, sister of the first wife, proves uncooperative.) Unfortunately for Harris' character (a horse trader), his dealings are with the owner of a traveling circus/medicine show, played by Alan Bates. His family proves even more dysfunctional, complete with a jealous half brother of the 2 wives.
If that were not enough drama, it seems that dead wife number one won't stay dead as she haunts anyone who trespasses on her terrain. A theme of irony runs deep, especially as all the main characters end up with less than they had bargained for.
A case of the Wild West meets The Twilight Zone, with the emphasis on the latter.",1378339200,,904,4.801282051282051

588083,3,6303113192,"A young man (River Phoenix) is grief-stricken by the death of his Indian wife. So much so that he guards over her corpse in the middle of the desert, with nothing but a rifle and his sanity. His father (Richard Harris) decides that in order to save his son, he must bring along the dead wife's sister and have them marry.

This was Phoenix's last film before his untimely death, and even though this Western drama doesn't really hold up today, it still has some nice qualities attached to it. First off, Silent Tongue does have a mystical, almost hypnotic look. It's filled with beautiful shots of the silent wasteland surrounding the characters. I was captivated by how the desert looked in the film. Plus, there was also some lovely divine music, that adds to the ambiance of the film's atmosphere (even if it does have that relatively corny 80's sound). The dialogue is very well-written, and its apparent simplicity seems appropriate for a quiet period Western such as this one. Unfortunately, there could have been improvements made for the plot, which is slightly convoluted and just downright strange. It's sometimes hard to follow, especially in the second half of the film when the spirit of the dead Indian wife becomes a major importance. I guess the screenplay is to blame, because it isn't very strong. There are so many questions that are unanswered. I know it's up for the viewer to decided what just happened (and what WILL happen), but the creators of this film seemed to have succeeded a bit too well. And Alan Bates.....well, let's just say that his performance is over-the-top. He's sometimes hard to understand due to his thick Irish accent, and his personality sometimes confuses the overall tone of the rest of the film.

Still, Silent Tongue is a good-looking Western, with a very hypnotic feeling attached to it. If you're looking for wall-to-wall action, then you better look somewhere else. This Western relies on dialogue, drama, and mysticism. There are good performances all-around, especially Phoenix and Harris, and the music is very nice. I just wish that the story itself would have been done better than what's here on the finished product.

Grade: C+",1277683200,,2186,4.886792452830188
588084,5,6303113192,"In a tribute, a Rolling Stone reviewer suggested this was the quintessential River Phoenix movie. I disagree, he gives a much better performance in 'My Own Private Idaho' but this story is better written. It's not really a western, though it is set in that time and place we nostalgically yearn for, with stark wide open spaces in hues of tan and brown. There's lots of dust and horses and broken people trying to mend their fragile lives. There's even a snake oil salesman and his son, complete with sideshow and assorted freaks. Richard Harris plays a father who loves his son (Phoenix) so much that he will purchase a wife for his sad and lonely child, but when she dies in childbirth, why not purchase her twin sister from the shifty, snake oil hawker who fathered them? Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Phoenix broods over the body of his lost love wrapping her in hides and suspending her body in a dead tree. He will not let her go and her spirit doesn't want to stay. Her soul visits him in visions that become so real to him that he almost shoots himself. He can't or won't do it, to join her would be love, to hold on to her is pure selfishness. Her twin sister knows that the dead are powerful and she agrees to help Harris break the hold his son has on her sister, but then she's outta there. Conceived in rape, she knows that she is a double second class citizen. One, she's a woman, and two she's half white and half native. She has nothing but her wits and a dark opportunity to free herself from her father and his mad schemes. She'll take four horses for her trouble and the hope for a new life. (Even the female actresses, who deliver wonderful performances, are overshadowed by their male co-stars in the marketing of this film.)
  Although told like a ghost story, this is really a love story about a father's love for his son. Harris will do anything for his child, even fight the apparition of his former daughter-in-law that appears in the form of a wolf. Steeped in native mythology and mysticism this story speaks of ties we create between those we love and those we use. In contrast, the snake oil vendor sees his daughters as commodities. The only love that exited for these lost, little girls was their mother, Silent Tongue, who couldn't even cry out when she was raped by their father. Another victim of his entrepreneurial father, is the twin's half brother, who insists on setting out after his half sister is abducted by Harris, and dragging his father along to do the 'right thing' and rescue her. The entire cast give strong and beautiful performances. It's a crime this is not available in wide screen because the melancholy landscape, is itself, a character in this tale. The film is rife with metaphor and if you want to think and be entertained this is the journey you'll want to take between real love and what poses for the love between us. Even though it is offered in a full screen format it is a good value for the prices that it is offered at. For those who prefer to have nonviolent fare, there are a few scenes including the rape that are inappropriate or upsetting. Overall I didn't know what to expect, but I was surprised and pleased by this complex study of relationships that transcend time and place.",1255564800,12,3250,4.49746192893401
588085,1,6303113192,"Regional encoding is a sly device.  People in the U.S., for instance, who want to see Sam Shepard's 1994 film 'Silent Tongue' will have to watch this bottom-of-the-barrel, pan-and-scan frisbee thrown out by Lions Gate.  Meanwhile, folks in Germany have a decent 2.35:1 transfer with Region 2 encoding, which excludes most interested U.S. consumers.

Lions Gate.  These folks are getting worse, more brazen in their lack of integrity.  I mean, consider their cynical chop-and-dub job on the new release 'High Tension,' or their heavy promotion and wide distribution of garbage like 'House of 1000 Corpses' and 'Confidence' and simultaneous neglect of acclaimed films like 'Stevie' and 'May.'

The expense associated with giving consumers a 2.35:1 transfer is only marginally above that of a 1.33:1 transfer.  The Lions Gate people are clearly bottom-line bean-counters who we must all hope will go bankrupt and disappear into a pile of ashes, if there's any justice in the world.

The woman dies in childbirth as well as the baby and Talbot is despondent and sits beneath a tree in the wilderness where he guards his late wife's body.  Her vengeful spirit repeatedly attacks him and demands that he ""free"" her yet he can't bring himself to honor her requests.  Meanwhile, Roe goes in search of the traveling show, once again, in hopes of purchasing the twin sister of his late daughter-in-law, believing she might help his disturbed son let go of the past.  But when the McCree refuses his request, Roe kidnaps the girl and they are followed across the frontier by McCree (who is also the father of the twins, conceived when he raped their mother, Silent Tongue) and their half brother, Reeves (Dermot Mulroney).
