2764349,5,B000ND5HCK,"Columbo makes for a very entertaining and interesting show to watch.  We watch these shows once per week, and look forward to seeing it as each week goes by.

I highly recommend this series.",1289260800,4,190,4.5588235294117645
2764350,1,B000ND5HCK,"I would like to write a review of the Columbo Bundle; however, I never received them.",1266710400,,85,4.375
2764351,3,B000ND5HCK,"Unfortunately I cannot paste in a link to another product in this review, so go to Amazon.co.uk and search for the Columbo DVD set for season 1 through 8.  It's only 45 pounds (half the price of this set), and it comes in a much nicer case.  You'll need to be able to play region 2 discs in your player.

I expect Playback will soon release a set for seasons 1 through 9 and then 1 through 10 and so on.  It will be good to have the full set, but to be honest, Columbo's glory days end with season 7.  Season 8 is vastly inferior to the first seven seasons, and I expect the later seasons will be also.  Though as much as I love Columbo, I'm sure I'll end up buying the complete set when it finally hits shelves sometime hopefully next year.",1237766400,3,741,4.075862068965518
2764352,5,B000ND5HCK,I enjoyed being able to see the entire show as it was filmed and not cut up for commercials as is the case when Columbo is shown in syndication.,1237507200,3,144,4.0
2764353,5,B000ND5HCK,"I bought this for my father-to-be, it's his favourite show of all-time. He was soooo stoked and happy. He had no idea, and when he unwrapped the paper, and saw, he freaked the heck out. Completely overjoyed. He couldn't believe that I remembered it was his favourite show, and he couldn't believe I spent so much money on him. At first, he wanted to not open it, because ""it looks so nice wrapped up"", but then he wanted to watch them all, right away. Even though he has seen all episodes, he was still so happy about this gift, and it definitely made his whole birthday and Christmas. I'm incredibly glad I made this purchase.

It's a good show. Kind of reminds me of Monk. It's cheesy at times, but it's cute, and makes you think. Not predictable, not bad at all. Just the happiness, though, of my father, makes me like the show even more.",1232496000,,841,4.391025641025641
2764354,5,B000ND5HCK,"I bought this set for my husband for Christmas. We are really enjoying watching them together, and are now almost through the second season. I've always been a Colombo fan. The quality is excellent.",1232409600,2,198,4.852941176470588
2764355,5,B000ND5HCK,We got what we ordered - lots of Columbo. The extra episodes of Columbo's wife as the main character were nice surprises. Columbo rocks! The quality is as good as on TV.,1232236800,4,169,4.3125
2764356,5,B000ND5HCK,"I you're a big Columbo fan such as I am you will absolutely enjoy this set. It's complete except for the longer movies, which Amazon also sells as another product.

These are professionally produced discs and their quality and clarity is exceptional. The only drawback is the lack of a detailed program description. There is a small blurb on the DVD sleeve but it doesn't go into much detail. Check out [...] for a full Episode Guide. It lists original air date, writer, director, co-stars etc.

A good buy for a great show.",1220140800,22,524,4.623655913978495
2764357,5,B000ND5HCK,"I'm very pleased with my Columbo gift set. I searched a lot of websites looking for the best deals. Finally with Amazon, I found the best deal, I received my product in a few days, and most of all, I love my gift set. It was everything I thought it would be. Thanks!",1202428800,7,266,4.037735849056604
2764358,5,B000ND5HCK,Need I say more? Columbo was/is the best detective on television. I am enjoying these shows all over again forty years after the first one burst upon the scene. Spend the money and enjoy two hours of mystery.,1324252800,,208,4.5
2764359,5,B000ND5HCK,"Best present I ever bought me...thoroughly enjoyable. Love Columbo! Peter Falk is awesome...his memory lives on through our love and admiration!!!

My ES-age daughter has been watching with me and is really enjoying the series. Avoids today's TV's gore and violence....and makes her think and look for clues and learn about human behavior. Plus, observing background of scenes for the 70s and 80s cars, attire, smog, architecture.",1324166400,,430,5.417910447761194
2764360,5,B000ND5HCK,I purchased all of Columbo DVDs. Most of them are excellent especially the seasons 1-3. We already watched all episodes twice.,1322611200,,126,5.0476190476190474
2764361,5,B000ND5HCK,I got what I ordered all at once and it came the day they said it would. Thank you very much.,1317254400,,93,3.4761904761904763
2764362,5,B000ND5HCK,"The cast is exceptional in these works.  You get to see many villans in their prime like Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner and Patrick Mcgoohan to name a few.  The writing is top notch and if anything else, after 40 years it is amazing to see how similar our culture is between then and now.",1315699200,,288,4.314814814814815
2764363,5,B000ND5HCK,"My wife and I were hoping for a memorial marathon around the time Peter Falk passed away. We really appreciated his acting. So when my wife was down and we realized it was never coming soon, I surprised her with this. All of the episodes up to season seven, all of the disks were not defective. They all worked great. Five stars",1314316800,,328,4.306451612903226
2764364,5,B000ND5HCK,"It's only been a few days since Peter Falk has passed away. I am so thankful that I live now - when we have access to so much video/media availability. I've owned this set for a long time, but it's great to be able to pop in Columbo anytime and be entertained by such a legendary actor.

I will write this review from a theological perspective. I think that the reason so many people loved, and still love, and will continue to fall in love with Columbo is because he is so much like Jesus. There is a passage in the Bible that says that God's kindness leads us to repentance. I believe that Columbo was beloved because he is like a Christ figure in the way he simultaneously brings justice and kindness toward each person he encounters - even the murderer of each episode. He always gives the murderer an opportunity to repent - to admit their guilt and to express their confession. However, he never does so maliciously or vengefully - he does so with gentleness and kindness. The murderers usually feel relieved ultimately because the truth about them has been exposed. There is freedom in the admission of guilt - and they almost always come to respect Columbo as a persistent pursuer of justice, as well as a friend. You get the feeling that one of the first persons each murderer will make contact after prison, will be Columbo - because they know that it's their own sin that got them in prison, but Columbo's pursuit of justice is good for them, society, and for the family of the victim.

Columbo portrays Christ in his humility, kindness, gentleness, mercy, love, and justice. Look for how Christ speaks to you in each episode. ""While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."" Like Christ - Columbo always pursues justice and love simultaneously for the good of man, culture, and for the victim - just like Jesus!",1309046400,2,1825,4.560975609756097
2764365,5,B000ND5HCK,"Hey, its Columbo. Your not going to find a better, ""old school detective"". For a man that only had one eye, he was amazing. I thougt I'd saw every Columbo that ever was made. I was shocked when I saw a new episode after watching the first disk. Your going to love this series.",1296950400,4,276,4.12962962962963
2764366,1,B000ND5HCK,"My husband ordered this item from this seller in Novemeber of 2010. He knows that I am a big fan of the Columbo tv show and wanted to surprise me for Christmas. Long story short, after telling us it was in the mail this item was never received...they then told us that they were sending out a replacement order... still waiting... very disappointed in this company. Would not recommend dealing with them. Had to get a refund from Amazon in the end.",1294444800,4,448,4.475609756097561
2764367,3,B000ND5HCK,"Disk 5 of Season 1 is totally defective.  I am now into season 3 and 1 of the 2 disks is defective.  With 4 seasons to go, I wonder how many more are defective.  I have had this experience with DVD's purchased throug stores and am wondering why these disks aren't checked before they're sold.  I contacted the seller on season 1, disk 5 and told him it was a dud and received no response to my email.  That caused me to rate him a ""3"" and I have a long way to go to see all those DVD's I ordered.  It's disappointing to not even get a response from the seller to make it right. I may not order anymore through Amazon sellers because of the lack of response.  At least when I buy locally, I can take it right back and get a refund.",1294444800,19,730,3.958904109589041
8176696,5,B000ND5HCK,It's Columbo! Only Peter Faulk could have settled into the character of Columbo so well. With the exception of the first episode (even then not bad) Faulk makes the character of Columbo absolutely timeless!!!,1470096000,,208,5.147058823529412
8176697,5,B000ND5HCK,My wife and I enjoyed this series and you can watch it with anyone and not offend. Very good job of transfer to dvd.,1428364800,,116,3.875
8176698,5,B000ND5HCK,"Quality discs-no ""duds"" . Despite misleading reviews to the contrary,these are the standard 1-sided discs (not double-sided as alleged). Obviously a Columbo-fan item,but entertaining.",1415836800,,183,6.666666666666667
8176699,5,B000ND5HCK,Bought this one for myself. The other set for a friend. This set is still great also. No skipping. Great play.,1415836800,,110,4.285714285714286

8176701,5,B000ND5HCK,"I am a big fan of this show. I loved it when it ran originally, but didn't  see all the episodes. Now I have a chance to watch uninterrupted! Yeah! !!!",1389657600,,151,3.870967741935484
8176702,5,B000ND5HCK,"dvd's were in great condition......at a great price,and very fast delivery....it.was really good to see columbo doing his thing  again..",1389052800,,136,5.8
8176703,5,B000ND5HCK,"I know it's expensive, and if Netflix or Amazon Prime streamed all the episodes I wouldn't have purchased this item. But if you love getting your 1970's fix with the L.A. detective in the tan raincoat, this set is worth the cost. Some have mentioned in their reviews poor product quality, which seems to occur a small percentage of the time. I have now watched maybe 30% of the episodes and had one very minor hiccup, luckily nothing that crashed the DVD. Overall, you get what the product description indicates and I'm happy with it.",1378684800,,534,4.631578947368421
8176704,5,B000ND5HCK,"The set is wonderful but the packaging is the worst.  Do it like the Dick Van Dyke Show using one skinny holder folder for each DVD.  Easier for arthritic hands to use.  Otherwise, like watching in chronological order & love the shows.",1351296000,,235,4.5476190476190474
8176705,5,B000ND5HCK,"I loved COLUMBO back in the seventies and jumped at the chance to see these shows once again.  COLUMBO is old-fashioned in the best sense of the word.  This series relies on character and plot rather than gore and forensics. The question is never who-done-it.  Each episode begins with the murder and we know not only who did it, but how and why they did it.  The pleasure comes in watching Lieutenant Columbo unravel the crime, and eventually outwit the culprit.

Sometimes the lack of attention to forensic details can be amusing.  For example, a murderer shoots his victim and attempts to conceal the time of death by keeping the body warm with an electric blanket. When he removes the blanket, he simply folds it and puts it back in the linen closet, where later it goes unnoticed by the army of police officers meticulously searching the house. How a blanket could lay atop a gunshot corpse and yet remain bloodless and pristine is not an issue to be explored in Columbo-land.

This set of DVDs is nostalgic fun for those of us who grew up watching the show.  I would also recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the TV detective genre.  Without COLUMBO there would be no Monk, no Brenda Johnson.",1325548800,,1200,4.544186046511628
