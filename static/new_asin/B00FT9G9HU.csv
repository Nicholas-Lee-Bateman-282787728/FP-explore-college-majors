8618525,5,B00FT9G9HU,"Cute movie! A friend of mine from Japan recommended this movie and I searched near and far to find a copy that had English subtitles. Fun, Silly, happy ending, this movie will make you feel good. Don't be like comic book guy from the Simpsons; ignore the non-linear, illogical plot line. Ideal foreign movie for date night, or if you want a mellow weekend activity.",1477094400,,365,4.630769230769231
