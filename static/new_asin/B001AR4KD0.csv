8588387,5,B001AR4KD0,"First heard Jorge Morel years ago playing a Gershwin medley while I was stuck in a traffic jam in New York City.  Not only did he make the experience tolerable but made me bound and determined to find everything I could that was recorded by this man.  Later had the good fortune to hear him in the library guitar concert series in Sheboygan, Wisconsin where I was teaching.  What an amazing treat.  If you play the guitar or don't you will like this man's artistry.",1388620800,,465,4.435294117647059
