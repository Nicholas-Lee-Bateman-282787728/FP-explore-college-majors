8177409,2,B000NDECDU,"This DVD is a recording of one of Mad Money's episodes. The ""Back to Basics"" title should be taken seriously, as this is too basic for anyone who has watched more than a couple of episodes already. If you really want to know how Mad Money works, get the book ""Jim Cramer's Mad Money; Watch TV, Get Rich"". It's got way more useful information in it than the short TV show ""Mad Money with Jim Cramer - Back to Basics"", and will reward your time spent with it.",1230854400,3,457,4.204545454545454
8177410,1,B000NDECDU,I purchased this CD and have tried it on two different DVD players as well as my computer DVD player and it does not work!!!  Mine also looked like a copy.  Don't waste your money!,1196899200,3,180,4.114285714285714
8177411,1,B000NDECDU,"These shows are shown over and over when Jim Cramer takes a day off from ""Mad Money"". Wait until the day before he does a ""Back to School"" special and is on the road or around the holidays.",1191283200,15,189,4.0
8177412,5,B000NDECDU,Jim Cramer's Back to Basics provides you with great insight into market cycles and market factors that can positively (or negatively) impact your investment strategies.,1186012800,16,168,5.76
8177413,3,B000NDECDU,I bought this from Amazon and the DVD inside was a blue DVD-R with a stick-on color laser-printed DVD label.  The DVD-R plays fine and it has the high-quality work of Jim Cramer...but the fact that it is a DVD-R concerns me.,1176940800,14,224,4.333333333333333
