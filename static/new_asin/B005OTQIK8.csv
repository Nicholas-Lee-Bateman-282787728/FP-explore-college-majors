4854696,5,B005OTQIK8,"Romeos is one of those rare gems that tugs at your heart strings and makes you cheer for the hero of the film. This movie has a lot of heart and soul. It was funny at times yet serious all the same with a very relatable subject matter to those going through what the main character is going through of a person trapped in the wrong body finding his place in the world and all the while searching for acceptance from the people around him and from within.

Rick Okon, who plays the brave and rebellious Lukas, a gay trans man who is transioning from female to male, is simply amazing. He played the character with such realism and truth that I couldn't take my eyes off of him, more so than the object of Luka's attraction, Fabio, the closetted bad boy played by Maximilian Befort, who was amazing as well in the film. The other actor who stood out in the film for me was Liv Lisa Fries, who played Lukas lesbian BFF -Ine, who had to accept her childhood friend transformation from a girl to a young man real fast.

All-in-all, this movie is exceptional and one of those that I could watch over and over again without getting tired of it.",1340496000,16,1137,4.308411214953271
4854697,4,B005OTQIK8,"I have seen ""Romeos"" on a screen in a small cinema and was quite impressed as I didn't think it would be such a good flick. I am not very into transgender cinema, so it's only a second film I saw in this matter. The first will be amazing ""Transamerica"".
""Romeos"" is a story about intolerance and fight against it, about seeking for love, about the importance of friendship. The story has no flows and all actors did great job. What do you need more?

4854700,5,B005OTQIK8,"I watched this movie last weekend with a bunch of friends, many of whom are transgender, and we all had overwhelmingly positive feelings about the film. There aren't very many films out there that are representative of the lives of trans people and even fewer (if any) deal with these populations with compassion and respect. This film was particularly good in that regard.

The lines or borders separating certain identities are often confusing for a lot of people, and the general public often uses film to make sense of the lives of trans people, making films (or TV shows) that center on trans people formulaic, sensationalistic, and predictable. Frequently when trans people watch media coverage on our own lives, we very quickly get the vibe ""this movie/show wasn't made for us, and the producers/directors have no idea what my life is actually like""; this movie, however, was pretty spot-on with what many trans men (and perhaps other trans people) are feeling: (in many cases) anxiety, fear, and worry. When do I disclose my trans status? Should I have to? Will the other person still find me attractive? Will I become a joke in my town? Will I be harassed? Will I be accepted and respected, validated and affirmed? With which gender will I be housed with? How will my exes, family, and friends react? (and will they disclose to my new friends that I am trans and compromise the perceived integrity of my person - or my safety?)

The film also explores other emotions and themes: Friendship, attraction, pride in what one can accomplish working daily on one's body [in this case, weightlifting], enticement, sexuality and shifts in sexuality -- and it does it all in ways that affirm truths trans people know but many non-trans people don't, for example that gender and sexual orientation are very separate (and yet somewhat interdependent) things. And that transition is something the whole person goes through, not just their outer shell.

This film very carefully manages to bring up issues that relate to bodies and the ways bodies are gendered without reducing Lukas to his physical transformation as so many films/shows featuring trans people do. We see him inject his T, we see him still with breast tissue, we see him struggle with his lower anatomy, and we also see him struggle with whether or not these are things that will be ""deal breakers"" with the men (or more specifically: man) he is interested in. For all these reasons and more, this film is incredibly relatable to many trans men (especially those that are gay) and engaging to watch. I particularly enjoy the fact that his best friend (and also ex-girlfriend) was given such a central role, that we got to witness the type of housing discrimination that is so prevalent, and that we got to see him engage with his family - as all these issues are in many ways more problematic (and more pervasive) for trans people than the physical transformation stuff, which is usually only a central issue for a year or two [typically].

In addition to all of that, all the characters are (in my opinion) super attractive, and the acting is superb. For a non-trans man, Rick Okon does an incredible job capturing both the excitement and exhilaration of sexuality as well as the anxieties and frustrations that accompany having a body that departs from what is generally assumed about bodies (specifically, that a person you perceive as male has a ""typical"" penis and male history, and related).

In short: The scenes could be taken from the daily lives of actual trans men. Way to go, Sabine Bernardi.",1332374400,5,3567,4.840983606557377
4854701,5,B005OTQIK8,"Wow. Romeos moved me in so many ways that I feel...speechless. It's been a long time since I watched something that made the tiny hairs on my arms stand on edge. Moved to tears not only because of the performances (although they were extremely good) but because...finally someone has come along and made a movie so brutally honest, without apologies, on a topic that so many people are ignorant about. And we all know what happens when people are ignorant. Ignorance leads to fear and fear leads to blind hatred. That ignorance, fear, and hatred is what kills our youth, whether its from suicide or bashing.

Romeos was one of the movies I actually paid to see at last years 2011 Philadelphia Q-Fest. And guess what? When my mom and I got to the theater and were standing in line, we found out that something was wrong with the film equipment, therefore, we could either get a refund or come back tomorrow. Well, I had work the next day and I live about a good 40 mins from Philadelphia, so I ended up taking the refund. Since then, I have been patiently awaiting the movie's release on dvd and worried that I would be disappointed after waiting so long. Normally, that's what happens, but I was tickled pink that Romeos far exceeded my expectations.

As the synopsis states above, the movie is about a 20 something pre-op transgender FTM (female to male) named Lukas. He gets accepted into some sort of Nursing program and must live in a dorm while completing the course work. Even though Lukas has been taking hormone treatments that have changed his voice, hair growth, and general appearance, he is technically still a female. Because of this, he is forced to stay in the female dorms. The head of housing keeps Lukas's secret, telling the girls that there is no room left in the men's dorms, therefore, Lukas would be staying with them until further notice. Lukas is upset at his housing situation, but perks up when he sees Ine, a friend that knew him when he was known as ""Miri"" and learns she will be staying at the dorm as well.

As Lukas gets settled in, the first part of the film reveals his daily routine as a transgendered person: hormone injections, lifting weights, measuring different areas of his body, etc. He also keeps a live journal online where he connects with other transgendered people in all stages of their transition. When Ine invites him out with her to a party, you really get to see how awkward it is for Lukas. Even though the hormone treatments have done wonders with his outward appearance-- facial hair, muscles, deep voice etc., the one thing they haven't helped him get rid of are his breasts. Lukas wears some sort of chest binding vest, but it still does not keep his bosom completely flat. This is why he layers his clothes, crosses his arms over his chest, never getting too close to anyone--another words, Lukas is always in a state of anxiety or paranoia, afraid that someone will notice.

The hunky, charismatic Fabio is the one person Lukas wants to notice him, but not for his upper appendages. Fabio is the epitome of a gay alpha male, appearing to be confident in mind and body. He attracts the attention of both males and females and in some scenes in the movie, you wonder if he is bi or if he dates women to make Lukas jealous (you will see what I mean if you watch the film). Lukas is fascinated by Fabio; a part of it could be first love, a crush, but I got the sense that Lukas views Fabio as the perfect male specimen. He is everything that Lukas wants to be-- perfect body and the confidence to go with it.

But all is not as it seems. The more time Lukas spends with Fabio, the more he tries to convince himself that it's his manly attributes that attracts him. But one of the hardest lessons Lukas must learn is how can he expect someone to love and see the real him if he can't even tolerate his own self? And although Fabio may be good at making people believe he is confident and an out and proud gay man, in reality he is closeted in many ways (again, I don't want to give too much away).

There are so many interesting topics that are addressed in this movie, but there were 2 that really fascinated me. One is during a scene where Lukas reluctantly goes with Ine to the beach because he finds out that Fabio is going. While everyone is stripped down to their swimming shorts or bikinis, you feel Lukas's awkwardness as he sits fully clothed with his layered shirts. As he watches Fabio and some of the guys swimming, Ine, his best friend, takes her bikini top off (remember, nude beaches are common in some other countries). Lukas points to Ine's breasts and starts explaining the breast removal process that he will eventually go through and Ine pushes his hand away and tells him to stop.
She asks, ""If you like boys, why don't you just stay a woman?""
Lukas responds, ""One has nothing to do with the other.""
Lukas is completely right. But Ine's question is one that confuses so many people in the world. There is a BIG difference between someone's gender and someone's sexuality but oftentimes they are thought to be one and the same. Gender is whether you are a male, female, or transgender (born with parts you don't identify with and wish to change such as in Lukas's case). Sexuality is your sexual preference, what you are attracted to, such as being straight, gay, bi-sexual, etc. So even though Lukas was born female, he identifies himself as male. He is in the process of physically becoming a male. Since he is attracted to men, that would make him gay. His best friend is being hypocritical. Ine openly admits she is a lesbian. So for her to tell Lukas that he might as well stay female if he likes guys sort of makes no sense. I could see that being more of a comment that someone homophobic would say. Lukas could have turned her words back on her and say, ""since you like women, why don't you grow a pe*is?""

This leads me to the last point I want to make that the movie addresses. Once Lukas's secret is revealed (I won't say how and why), prejudice starts to rear its ugly head. Fabio turns into one of his greatest tormentors, calling him names, flaunting other men and women around him as if to say he would date anyone other then him. Straight people are not the only ones that can be ignorant and prejudice towards transgendered people. The homosexual community can be a transgendered person's greatest nightmare. Why? Because ignorance breeds fear, and fear breeds hate. Fabio really does care for Lukas. What holds him back is his lack of knowledge about transgendered issues and the pressure of what others would think of him liking someone like Lukas. There is no denying Fabio's curiosity and once he lets go of worrying about what others may or may not think about him and Lukas, he is then more willing to let go of his prejudices and learn more. And let me be clear, Fabio is not as confident as Lukas thought he was. There are many reasons why, but that is for you to find out!

If you think that is all that's covered in Romeos, you are in for a surprise. For a 94 minute movie, it touches on so many more issues, themes, etc. But I don't want to give everything away. It sounds like I did, but I'm telling you, I really didn't scratch the surface. So if you are up for a good drama, some romance, a little comedy, mixed in with real, true life issues that transgendered people go through in today's society, then you really are in for a treat!

4854702,4,B005OTQIK8,"""Romeos""....is a Carefree title....a Fun title.  BUT, buckle up your seatbelts and hold on tight....for the ride you're about to be taken on is, often, neither carefree nor fun.  And why is that?  Because, over and over, you'll be asking yourself:  HOW is this young guy...this Rick Okon, from a little town in the Northeast fringes of Germany, able to drag us inch by inch by inch into all his emotional turmoil:  His shyness...his physical discomfort...his fear of discovery...his beginnings of love?  ...And while doing so with little more than his frequent arms-hugging-himself poses...his facial expressions...and those EYES.  Well, the answer is just something you'll have to figure out after the trip.  For each of us, it will have been different.

But...forget the ""HOW"" we've just discussed.  More important is the ""WHAT""....for what we are being given here is a Near-Equal to the Oscar winning Best Actor performance in 1999's ""Boys Don't Cry"".  That time, Hilary Swank......this time, a rising, young German star.  As the transgendering Lukas, Okon takes us along on an important part of his journey through the swirling emotions of Hormone Replacement Therapy, into complete physical transformation from female-to-male.  BUT....in this instance, unlike in other films, the end goal is to find a same-sex (Male / Male) relationship.  About which, please note the following:

((  I can talk about this movie's particular sex-change circumstances in no better way than to paraphrase a quote by Reviewer, ""nnenok from Slovenia"" (at Imdb.com):  The MOST IMPORTANT lesson this film gives to us and to any already Transgendered-to-Male person (who is attracted to another Male) IS:  ...Being attracted to a woman doesn't make you a man---but FEELING like a man does.  ))

So...maybe ""Boys Don't Cry"".  Yet, perhaps at times, this film will bring you to the verge of doing so.  For what we are seeing is a near breath-taking and heart wrenching performance (I often recall James Dean), about a transgendering, young German who has fallen for a macho Lover-Boy type.  Yes, yes, Maximilian Befort, as Fabio, has a face and body which will keep your dreams HOT for days.  A Lover-Boy?...sure. A Sex Bomb?...you bet.  In fact, he's Sex on a Stick!  Yet, despite acting self-centered and forever off to the next conquest, his scenes with Lukas are always exciting ones....giving us a gut feel for the Fever which is building up between these 2, a Fever always tempered by fear of Fabio discovering the hidden transgendered condition.

As to Fabio's side of this relationship, he is kept almost always off balance, and in a perplexed state:  Lukas being turned-on by Fabio....quickly followed by instances of Lukas shutting Fabio down.  But, still, hard as it is to live with the emotional changes being thrown at him....Fabio does keep trying; he keeps coming back for more.  (Leading to this Reviewers opinion that Lukas has him hooked....letting the line out, then pulling it back--even if not always aware he's doing so).

And so, I TRULY BELIEVE the final lovemaking scene is giving us The Key to this relationship; oh, yes indeed, it is.  But that is not half as much as we are being told by the last few seconds shot, wherein we are watching through the lens of a digital camera...and seeing:  A deliriously happy, and completely transgendered Lukas, taking off running through seaside sand dunes toward water's edge.  Come on, now....STOP AND THINK about it!  That CAN'T be all we're seeing.  Because you know what?  SOMEONE is holding that camera....You wanna take any bets as to WHO?

Enjoy this Special Movie....And, thank you, Sabine.

PS--And amidst all the turmoil...Thank Heavens for the occasional fun, lightness, and warm support given by terrific young actress, Liv Lisa Fries, as ""Ine""...the B(Girl)FF of our Lukas during their growing-up years.

PPS--Hey, Folks, This has been a hard ride...and you deserve a break.  So, here's a little Enjoyment Tip for you.  Give a look at this great little Fun...Straight (or is it?) movie:  ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Target/dp/B004H4AD2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Target</a>"".  That Great Brit, Bill Nighy, is funnier than you've ever seen him....with a gorgeously conniving Emily Blunt always around upsetting things.  Oh..oh, and don't forget that guy of ""Harry Potter"" fame: Rupert Grint is a laugh riot....in his bathtub scenes.  So, buy it here at Amazon.com and have a BLAST!

Now...for my very last REALLY BIG TIP (for those of you Vid-watchers having an All-Regions DVD player):  Watch for the upcoming early release, in the United Kingdom, of one of the most highly reviewed Gay movies of 2011.  That's right, ""Weekend"" is due out on March 19, 2012 in Region 2, Blu-ray format.  If interested, Amazon.com/UK has it.  So, you need only go to the bottom of this page and click on 'United Kingdom'.  Happy viewing.",1327276800,17,4932,5.178481012658228

This was a really good story.  I was very impressed with the honesty and compassion I found here.  The female writer/director (Sabine Bernardi) really gave the subject matter and characterization of Lukas a lot of integrity.

This drama centers around the emotional life of Lukas (Rick Okon), a young and very passable German Female to Male (FTM) transsexual, on his 25th shot of testosterone and 11 weeks away from his top surgery.  Lukas has begun his year of social service and struggles with being forced to live in the female quarters.  Here only one person in his dorm knows the secret of his gender identity... a female lesbian who was his best friend in high school and is aware of his whole transition.  Lukas is very self conscious about his body (breasts, in particular) and is very needy and clingy with his female friend in most social situations.  Although she struggles to accept how much her friend has changed... ultimately, she is always there for him and I thought he was very lucky to have her.

In addition to these struggles, Lukas (who identifies as a gay man) begins to explore his attraction to men.... men who assume he is a gay man.  The emotional turmoil of dealing with his attractions, but not feeling comfortable or safe to act on anything or be honest with others, is a strong focus here.

Lukas doesn't have it easy.  And yet I didn't find this story depressing.  It was actually hopeful and inspiring in many respects. His family is at least partially accepting, he has one really good friend... and he's got online connections to other transmen who share their stories and support him.  I was glad he had a support system and that the film wasn't just a story focused on violence and hatred.  This was so much more.

When I found out the actor who plays Lukas is a bio male... I expected to be disappointed that a real transman wasn't cast here.  I mean, sure that would of been great.  But I gotta say... Rick Okon did a beautiful and highly believable job here.  The emotion conveyed in every minor expression and in his body language was truly exceptional.  And if I hadn't read in the reviews that Lukas is played by a bio male... I woulda thought he really was a pre-op transman after seeing him with his shirt off (sure looked like real female breasts to me!).  I also read that the casting was open to real transmen and that there just weren't many replies.  So it is what it is... and I was really pleased that this actor really gave the characterization of Lukas the honesty it deserved.

Now some of the other acting was so-so, lol.  And I'm not sure how Fabio (the gay man Lukas falls for) is considered an alpha male... he's way too pretty and skinny, lol.  Aside from the breast shots and a few male butt shots and some kissing... there is no graphic sex shown here.

I loved the story.  Admittedly, as a lesbian, I'd of (selfishly) loved to see Lukas attracted to women (or hey, more sexy scenes of his cutie lesbian pal)... but his identification as a gay male certainly made him very interesting and complex.  I especially liked the confrontation he has with the confusion of why he didn't just stay female if he was attracted to men... life would certainly be easier for him.  But he replies that one thing has nothing to do with the other... and this was a very interesting point to make for those trying to wrap their minds around his identity.

4854758,5,B005OTQIK8,"This movie surprised me in a good way, and that does not happen often these days. We follow our lead character through his hero's quest, with a few bumps in the road. What is good about the movie is the good guy is not perfect, he makes mistakes, and he has a few surprises for everyone along the way. This is not a typical ""genre"" movie in any way, because no one is who they seem, boy meets girl, boy meets girl, boy meets boy, what is ""straight"" and what is ""gay"" are tossed into the air only to be turned around on their head again and again. It's funny, it's got suspense, and it's got summer.
I don't want to reveal the plot because the story coming at you with the twists and turns is part of the fun, like a roller coaster you are riding for the first time, but it takes some stuff that still has controversy around it and makes it a human story that transcends category, and sympathizing and empathizing with him becomes the joy of the movie.",1376956800,,951,4.202185792349726

4854768,5,B005OTQIK8,"This is a great movie about a teenager who was born biologically female but feels male, and so begins to transition to male with the help of injections of testosterone. He is doing his civil service in Germany so he is in a new city and he gets to really try on his new identity. But he hasn't had the operations necessary to not have problems to carry around like female breasts. It is really incongruous to see this guy with boobs which just look like these unnatural appendages on him. Being young and impetuous he doesn' t always use his better judgment and gets into plenty of uncomfortable positions because most of the young adults he meets don't know he is anything other than purely male. He is fortunate to be doing his service with a girl who has been a close friend since childhood. This is in many ways a very realistic movie. One of the great things about it is that Lukas, the FTM guy is also gay, as in he likes boys sexually. At one point his female pal asks him why not just stay a girl if he likes boys and make it easier on himself. He angrily says that his gender has nothing to do with it! This is difficult for many people to understand but it is totally TRUE! There is your gender identity and then there is your sexuality and the one does not necessarily define the other. Anyway, Lukas falls for a guy who falls for him but then finds out the truth. Lukas is humiliated and even though he still yearns for the guy, he feels like it would be an impossibility especially because the guy he likes seems really full of himself and shallow. But, as with Lukas, people are more complicated than you might guess until you get to really know them. So I highly recommend this movie!",1374451200,,1699,4.3125

4854773,5,B005OTQIK8,"There are two ways this movie is fantastic:

First, this movie is great in all the traditional ways!:
 A unique storyline that really keeps you engaged and thinking - Check!
 Extraordinary actors that know EXACTLY what they're doing and make every moment real and believable - Double Check!
 Cinematography that captures every emotional detail needed to keep you engaged and feeling all the right things at all the right times - Check!
 A soundtrack that is completely perfect in every way - CHECK!

Second, this movies takes non-traditional subject matter and makes in seem like this is the kind of movie you are used to seeing all the time! The way it captures this short period of a pre-op transgendered man's life (meaning a female transitioning to male), completely captivates and enthralls you in a way that is VERY rare in this genre of movies!

I encourage everyone to see this movie! If I could rate this 10 stars, I would. It deserves to be seen by SO many more people and I am VERY surprised and disappointed it hasn't won any awards in the states yet!",1373673600,2,1063,4.652406417112299

As someone who has always felt uncomfortable concerning people going through this and could totally relate to one of the males and his difficulty in accepting someone to whom he is attracted who is going through that process of changing his/her identity.  It sure proves you cannot always choose who you love.  It's just something that happens.  His final acceptance of the lead character was totally breathtaking and the scene was wonderful and kind of hot.,1373328000,,577,4.917525773195877

4854779,4,B005OTQIK8,"The story is about a mostly passing transsexual (female to male) in a college dorm environment getting stuck in the female dorm, and navigating relationships which are complicated by being both pre-op and keeping it a secret.

From a theatrical perspective, the movie was well acted, the theme was consistent, and it was about on par with most mainstream movies on level of engagement. I noticed myself being distracted by other things during some of the slower scenes, but it held me engaged enough to watch and comprehend the whole movie.

From a social perspective, I liked that the movie highlighted the trans community as having a support network through video blogs. Having a support group is crucial for anyone, and can be a significant challenge for minorities such as the trans community. It's important for anyone to realize that there are support networks available - even if they are not in your local area, the internet will be able to connect you with people you can relate to and help you through difficult times.

I also liked that the movie didn't portray much violence. Violence is a major problem for the trans community, so it was refreshing to see the life of a trans individual portrayed as normal - experiencing the everyday human problems of fitting in and navigating relationships. People shouldn't have to worry about violence, so hopefully this movie signals a shift in society towards acceptance, understanding, and compassion.",1373155200,,1455,5.0041322314049586

4854790,3,B005OTQIK8,"I liked this movie, but casting Rick Okon as Lukas was a serious problem for me. I never for one second believed he was or had ever been female, so I couldn't help relating to that character as a man and only a man.

It's a sharp contrast to the casting 15 years ago of Steven Mackintosh in the mirror-image role of Kim in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Different-for-Girls/dp/B0053OAF6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Different for Girls</a>. Kim is a transgendered male-to-female, and Mackintosh is SO believable as a woman that I had to do considerable research to ascertain that the actor himself wasn't transgendered. He wasn't, and, in fact, he doesn't look the least bit feminine in real life, which makes his casting as Kim all the more remarkable.

Romeos is a pretty good movie anyway, but it doesn't depict the transgender experiences of the character as successfully as it does his experiences as a man. The movie would have been better with someone else cast as Lukas or if Lukas had just been a gay man, which is how he comes across anyway.

In order to make sense of the character Okon was portraying, I had to ignore all the transgender issues, which simply were absurd for that entirely male character, and I'm sure that's not what the director intended.",1344124800,4,1311,5.116822429906542
