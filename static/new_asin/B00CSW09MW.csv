8585901,1,B00CSW09MW,"I was so VERY disappointed with this movie. I have seen some low budget movies before that were really good, but this one was beyond low budget. After over half a hour or so I cut it off. In several parts of the movie the sound goes off. In some scenes the picture was shaking. In another part when the girl and her Dad were in her room talking it sounded like they were in a tunnel. This movie was poorly written and filmed. Dont waste your money on it.",1428537600,,454,4.055555555555555
8585902,2,B00CSW09MW,"I purchased this movie because I new a couple of the comedians/ names and thought it should be a pretty good comedy show.  Well, I was wrong. About 10-15 minutes into the show, I was already unimpressed.  They have Lavelle as being the star, and he was barely in the film.  He was in there at the beginning and at the very end at the end of the credits.  Karen Malina White was more a part of the show then Lavelle and her name is not mentioned anywhere on the box.  And where is Joe Torry??  The only character that ""popped"" to me was the Uncle.

 It seemed like the maid was fumbling over lines a couple of times.  It just seemed like they didn't make this show believable and engage the audience.  I am a stage actor myself, and I've seen theater plays better than this.  Sometimes it looks like the kids are overacting which would have been ""okay"" for stage, but not for a movie.

There was far too many flashback moments, and once or twice, I didn't even realize they did a flashback and was wondering how in the world did they go from getting off the bus, to the beach scene?  And the sound quality was horrible, especially when the kids came out of the hospital and was talking.  I had to turn my tv volume up to 50 just to make out the conversation.

Another portion when the Uncle went back to pick up the kids and him and Elise were talking on the porch, you could barely hear them over the background music.

On several of the songs throughout the show, you can hear where it would skip a portion and like loop back and wasn't fluent.  The music video at the end was one of the better parts of the film that looks more somewhat professional.  Although, I didn't care for that they had the little girl in the rap ""video"" running around in a tube top and all the adults was covered up.  Stop exploiting these kids!!!  I would give this show a D- at best.",1389052800,,1863,4.209039548022599
8585903,1,B00CSW09MW,"This was a low budget movie with poor acting, bad sound, lighting, directing and a horrible storyline and script. Even Elise Neal who is an experienced actress did not perform well in this movie. The only acting worth semi watching was uncle Larry, Maribelle and the friend Olivia (I think). The best part of this travesty was the music video at the end performed by Silkk the Shocker's son Lil King Miller..Paparazzi Fresh. My kids enjoyed that but begged me to turn it off during the entire movie. We watched for laughs at how terrible it is. The other two reviews must have some special interest or investment in this movie",1380844800,,626,4.648648648648648
8585904,4,B00CSW09MW,"My family thought this was a cute movie about blended families. I'm a big Lavelle Crawford fan, so I also cracked up at just about everything he said. A nice family movie night flick!",1375920000,,183,4.411764705882353
