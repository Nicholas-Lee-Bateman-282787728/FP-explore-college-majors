8186376,3,B000OR273C,"The description for this item says the 5 programs are on two discs, however it is not.  The package I received was a new, unopened package.  On the outside of the package is says ""Two-Dvd Set Contains:"", but there was only 1 disc in the package.  All of the advertised programs are on the one disc, but there is no menu; all programs run back-to-back so you have to fast-forward or skip-to-a-scene to find the individual programs. What a pain!  I don't mind that all programs are on one disc.  The fact that the disc has no menu system is what I don't like.  The content of the programs are okay and what I expected.  Same problem with the V-J Day dvd.",1221609600,3,652,4.295081967213115
