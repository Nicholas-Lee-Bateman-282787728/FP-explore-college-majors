7909979,5,B00000ICF7,"This tape continues Miaka's search for the Susaku 7.  She finds one of them in the red haired leader of the bandits, he's so much fun.  He has a hard time figuring out the love triangle going on in Miaka's life and he and Nuriko clash many times.  The story that truly sells this video is that of Lady Shoka.  Her story is the reason this tape is titled ""The Dying Land"".  It will leave you wanting to cry.  It is so bittersweet.  Thumbs up, many thumbs up.",1001894400,,457,4.125
7909980,5,B00000ICF7,"fushigi yugi is the best anime i have ever seen! the guys are really cute (and if you are a guy reading this, then so are the girls i would guess). there are lots of inticate turns that you don't expect. this movie imparticular is great. not only is a continuation of the best anime ever written, it's got my favorite character, amiboshi in it!",988675200,,344,4.3076923076923075
7909981,5,B00000ICF7,"The Fushgi Yugi series is about a Japanese school girl who is transported into another world: ancient China.  This story may seem to be for younger kids, but it's more targeted for the teenage audience (13up).  It is not a  kids video, so if you're thinking about getting it for your 7 year old  niece, bad idea.  This time in Miaka's adventures, she meets 2 new  charaters of the Suzaku Seven.  Once all of the Suzaku 7 are gathered, she  gets one wish: to return home. I highly advise this video for those of you  who like the Fushigi Yugi series, and for those who love to laugh: the new  character is hysterical, he reminds me of a royal bandit, and what's with  his vampire looking teeth, and he claims that he hates girls because they  always get him into trouble, well then, why does he fall for Miaka!",960508800,5,809,4.355704697986577
7909982,5,B00000ICF7,"I've got to say, my review might be biased, cuz Tasuki is the BEST in the whole series!!!!!!  Anyway, the animation in this movie is just awesome and the comedy is hallarious.  I never thought so much humour could be put into  serious moments!  If you want to hear more, just email me!",929750400,,285,4.320754716981132
7909983,5,B00000ICF7,"I thought this tape overall kicked @$$!! I love Tasuki!! He Rules!! Accept I thought the voice they casted him with was a little too low. He's only 17, but his voice makes him sound like he's 35!! But don't let that  discourage you from buying the tape, you get used to it pretty quickly.  Another good thing about the tape is they kept the LEKKA SHIEN'S!! I  thought that ruled. What I didn't get though, is when Genro(Tasuki's  nickname) first called on his phantom wolves he used Japenese, but the  second time he did he used English!! What the heck is that!! Oh, well. In  conclusion: THIS TAPE RULES!! BUY IT!!",927936000,,615,4.446428571428571
7909984,5,B00000ICF7,"It took my friends literally years to find an anime that I would actually watch, and this was it.  For once I can say I'm glad they're right!  Of the series so far, this tape is easily the best.  I hope it only continues to  get better.",927590400,,236,3.9574468085106385
7909985,5,B00000ICF7,Don't buy Fushigi Yuugi from here!  There are fan subs that are distributed for free and or charge only postage-handeling and price of the casset!  You can get more for your money!  look up Fushigi Yuugi fan subs  on the internet!!!,926467200,,232,4.585365853658536
