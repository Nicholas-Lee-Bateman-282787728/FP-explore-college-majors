2888470,5,B000SO7PCE,"A must for all CSI fans. Each of the three CSI shows, CSI, Miami and New York have their own great stories and characters,therefore each show can stand on it's own merit. New York with it's gritty attitude and Big Apple skylines, comes across well in its third season. Fantastic character growth, excellent performances by GARY SINICE,MELINA KANAKAREDES and the rest of the cast. The writing is top notch( god bless the writers!!!)You will not be disappointed. Season three races along to the season finale that was edge of your seat drama. You won't be disappointed.",1202860800,,567,4.916666666666667
2888471,5,B000SO7PCE,This is my 2nd favorite CSI. I love the characters on CSINY. I usually don't watch it on tv cause it comes on late. But I do buy the dvds. I can sit there and watch them all day. Its really one of the best shows on tv.,1197072000,,218,3.5625
2888472,5,B000SO7PCE,"Another great season, the cast and crew have done a fantastic job, story lines are very inventive and intriging. Can't wait till the next season is released.",1195776000,,157,4.851851851851852

New York - The Complete Third Season</a>&nbsp;We really enjoyed this Season. The look and feel of the NY version is so different from the original and other spin off. We are Looking forward to the Fourth season.",1194652800,8,370,8.048780487804878
2888474,5,B000SO7PCE,"Third seson of CSI New York is the best seson of this TV show. Just is shame for spanish tv fans see it DVD in bad spanish sound track. Sadly, it isn't with subtitles.",1193875200,6,167,3.9411764705882355
2888475,5,B000SO7PCE,"CSI NY is the more somber of the hit trilogy, and in its third season is even a little darker.  There are lots of bizarre crimes and murder weapons, e.g., an angel falls from the sky; a man is impaled on a condom machine, maybe by John McEnroe (!); a victim pronounced dead pulls a Lazarus.  And the cast has their own personal crises:  Mac (Gary Sinise) meets the son of is late wife, gets in trouble with the commissioner when a suspect throws himself off a roof, and has problems with his new love (the lovely Claire Forlani).  Stella (the great Melina Karakedes) faces possible infection from a victim with HIV; Danny is kidnapped by brutal drugrunners (well played by Carmine Giovanassi); Hawkes (Hill Harper) is framed for murder by a vindictive Edward Furlong; and Lindsay (Anna Belknap) testifies against the madman who killed four of her friends ten years previously.
I enjoy the CSI shows; it's fun to watch how the team pulls their evidence together; as in all the shows, Gary Sinise is the glue that holds the series together.  He's superb.  My only complaint:  the awful music they use is more of a distraction than an enhancement.  Where do they come up with these awful songs and singers?",1192579200,17,1203,4.6415094339622645
2888476,5,B000SO7PCE,"I felt the extra features section of this C.S.I. New York was especially informative. The Body Farm feature was expertly done. The deceased were respected at all times. I was a great way to let the public know all the ways science is advancing not only in labs, but also in the outside environment (also labs). This will hopefully let the criminal element of the public know that somehow, someway, someone is going to catch them.

You could tell that Rebecca Wilson is very well educated and well versed on the subject of ""Forensic Anthropology"" . I learned a few things on the journey through the farm. I feel that we will be seeing more of Rebecca Wilson as she continues advance in her field. She is truly gives a voice to the dead.",1191974400,,735,4.485074626865671
2888477,4,B000SO7PCE,"On this season of C.S.I. New York lookout for Episode 5 ""Oedipus Hex"". This episode shows off some of the hottest members of the Suicide Girls, even Missy Suicide (the founder of SG). Hot girls and possibly the best use of Pantera's ""Walk"" ever. The performance by the Creepy Carries is reason enough to pick up this season of C.S.I. New York.",1187740800,2,343,4.548387096774194

2888489,4,B000SO7PCE,"The third season of CSI:NY featured some excellent acting and some clever stories. As usual with these CSI shows the plausibility factor can be questionable, but overlook that and just enjoy the creativity of the stories as well as the NYC location shots There were a number of especially entertaining episodes, particular the Criss Angel magician episode, and especially the season finale, which was almost cinematic. Excellent ending to the series. Likewise the Edward Furlong episode was notably creepy - that guy hasn't progressed well since the T2 film and he plays the crazy criminal role quite well here.",1455235200,,611,5.181818181818182

poor choice.  I found the music obnoxious.  I  fast  forwarded every time the music came on while the evidence was being examined which was  much too often.",1437782400,,307,4.4

2888504,5,B000SO7PCE,"If you are going by statistics, then CSI NY emerged by far as being the weakest link. I freely admit that as being a major fan of it. First CSI NY tried to imitate the gritty nature of the original and then mimicked the artistic style of Miami, all but becoming almost a hybrid of the two. I'm glad to say that during the course of Season 3 - CSI NY steps out of the shadows of its predecessors and finds its own flavor with three dimensional characters as opposed to more two dimensional ones. Obviously I can't speak for everyone else but if CSI NY has one trump card to add to its aces, it's Lindsay Monroe. I can't explain it other than to say that she simply steals 82 to 88% of the scenes she is in. Especially with Messer, Mac and Stella - she is simply the ultimate enhancement talent of the CSI franchise next to Sara Sidle of Las Vegas. And for a newcomer, that's a pretty impressive thing to pull off. I love watching the character development and the very real challenges put forth to the team. I thoroughly enjoyed this season and as the perennial underdog of the franchise, NY continues to demonstrate why it should be taken seriously.",1428192000,,1149,4.348837209302325

2888546,4,B000SO7PCE,"I've been keeping up with the DVDs for CSI and CSI: Miami pretty much since they were first being released. But for some reason, I never was into CSI: NY. Possibly because the other series are set in warm climates and tend not to make me jealous, possibly becuase there are enough interesting characters (read: science guys and cool murders solved) to keep a girl busy for plenty of time. Whatever the reason, NY just wasn't for me.

Now things have changed. I'm still jealous of the snow on the ground, whether it's real or fake. However, there are new science guys to be discovered and that brain scanner in Dr. Hammerback's autopsy suite and the virtual autopsy room are the ultimate in technological gadgetry. See y'all in season 10!",1266364800,2,737,4.6692307692307695

2888548,4,B000SO7PCE,"I like the program but this season set unfortunately started getting a little preachy and VERY soap-opera-ish. AIDS awareness, political wrangling, and some of the vaguaries of the legal system all contributed to a slightly less than perfect product. Nevertheless, some great writing made this an excellent TV experience, certainly better than 98% of the stuff being broadcast today.",1260316800,,383,5.508474576271187
2888549,5,B000SO7PCE,"Briefly, the actors are still doing a great job with the program. Personally, while watching most of this season, I find that I'm going back to the first season when Danny had been in trouble with Tanglewood and the Minhaus shooting. With both Don Flack and Sheldon Hawks getting put into the hot seat, you could see the resentment they were feeling when Mac didn't seem like he was supporting them. I said ""now you know what Danny felt"". A sad thing about this season was the introduction of a new person with no background history other than she came back from teaching and was getting into Mac's life. I felt she pushed too hard and got what she deserved.
So far the whole season was as enjoyable as the first with a few twists and turns to keep you on your toes. Now if the writers don't ruin another good show with bad writing, then it might make it as long as the other two parent shows.",1258502400,2,893,4.321428571428571
2888550,3,B000SO7PCE,"After getting past my disappointment over Season 2, I had every expectation that Season 3 would borrow more from Season 1 then Its predecessor. There WOULD be commentary on episodes that aired after Christmas, there WOULD be 7 discs with the Special Features together on their own disc, storylines WOULD be covered In depth this WOULD be An accurate DVD. Perchance to dream because Mischief Night 2007(when Season 3 went on sale) played A trick on me. Season 3 failed more then Season 2. A word that came Into play with Season 3 & later Season 4, was redundancy. Both commentary & Special Features comported to the same episode. In the smart world, you give An episode 1 or the other, NEVER both! That began here. The episodes that were doubled up were 0EDIPUS HEX & SILENT NIGHT. The former has THE SUICIDE GIRLS ROCK C.S.I. NEW YORK, the latter, THE MAKING OF..... The only other episodes with commentary alone are NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE & CONSEQUENCES. 0ther Special Features are BREAKING THE KILLER CODE(all about Shane Casey played by Edward Furlong) & HILL HARPER VISITS THE BODY FARM. All In all, the Special Features could have been better, but the redundancy Is unforgivable.

There were storylines In Season 3 that were only bested by those In Season 5 & nary was there coverage. C.S.I. MIAMI(Season 4) & C.S.I. NEW YORK(Season 2) had A crossover FELONY FLIGHT/MANHATTAN MANHUNT where Horatio Caine & Mac Taylor pursued serial killer Henry Darius from Miami to New York. FELONY FLIGHT was Part 1 on MIAMI, MANHATTAN MANHUNT was Part 2 on the latter. The latter made reference to Lindsay seeing more blood then was found At the scene of Darius's latest New York murder & this was addressed In this SILENT NIGHT & fully tackled In SLEIGHT OUT OF HAND where we learned of the tragic event In Lindsay's childhood that motivated her to become A cop. Season 3 had us all on pins & needles with the Stella AIDS Scare which was began flowing In HEART OF GLASS & carried transmitted Into THE RIDE-IN, A DAZE OF WINE & ROACHES, WHAT SCHEMES MAY COME, PAST IMPERFECT & COLD REVEAL. There was disgraced Detective Dean Truby who was Introduced In CONSEQUENCES & was seen again In COMES AROUND. Truby resurfaced because of what began In PAST IMPERFECT At the same time the Stella AIDS Scare was being resolved, Clay Dobson, played by Joesph Lawrence. Dobson was A serial killer who got released form prison due to Truby's downfall. All of Truby's arrests were reexamined & Dobson benefited from this technicality. 0ut of jail, Dobson resumed his murderous ways. Mac went after him & Dobson decided to commit suicide In A way that would also disgrace Mac-plummeting to the ground landing on An NYPD patrol car. This led to An Internal Affairs Investigation where Mac's ass was in the roaster. Mac was suspected of killing Dobson In A rage. Mac went thru this In COLD REVEAL & COMES AROUND where Truby actually came thru for Mac by offering Mac A trump card to use against NYPD brass. There was the Irish Mob, Introduced as the B-plot In SWEET 16 & front & center In the finale SNOW DAY.

Season 3 confirmed what we knew all along, that the C.S.I.s occupied the same universe with Jerry Bruckheimer's non-C.S.I. shows. Danny Pino who plays Detective Scotty Valens on COLD CASE, brought Valens from Philadelphia to New York In COLD REVEAL because Adam Ross, who performed the AIDS test for Stella, mistakenly put Stella's blood Into CODIS which popped for A match In A Philadelphia murder Valens was Investigating. Nelly Furtado guest-starred In SOME BURIED BONES, playing professional shoplifter Ava Brandt. Furtado's songs also bookended the episode, At the start, the club anthem MANEATER & As the finale, the ballad, ALL THINGS MUST COME TO AN END. Illusionist Criss Angel played murderous magician Luke Blade In SLEIGHT OUT OF HAND. We also got An education In Season 3. HEART OF GLASS centered on the death of A man who we learned had HIV. His blood made contact with Stella's & later It was discovered that the man was by his sister by mistake because the sister suffered from Capgras Syndrome. Capgras Is condition where the sufferer Is so scared by his/her reflection that they think they are looking At somebody else. The sister believed the woman In the mirror was stalking her & her brother. Something learned & the start of A storyline & what did we get for It? No commentary, no Special Features, NOTHING. Just like Season 2, Season 3, the DVD, did A disservice to the show & to the city of New York. Season 3 re-enforced how far superior Season 1 Is.

Stay tuned for Season 4.",1254700800,,4584,4.699004975124378
2888551,3,B000SO7PCE,"In my quest to develop a slightly stronger stomach - like my mother, who as a biology lab assistant could eat a sandwich from one hand while doing a dissection with the other - I have occasionally attempted to raise my gross-out threshold by watching one or anther of the CSI shows over dinner. Not much luck with that, I'm afraid, I remain as hopelessly lily-livered as always... while still enthralled by the science and the solving of intricate puzzles. Season Three of CSI: New York delivers all those qualities; uncomfortably gruesome realism, criminal doings and forensic puzzles, among the denizens of New York.  All that is wrapped in sophisticated production values, well worthy of a theatrical release, and performed by a top-notch cast. Gary Sinese is one of those relatively few actors, like Gene Hackman, who can star in a movie or a television show while being absolutely convincing as an ordinary working guy.

The extras in this set include commentaries for the episodes ""Not What it Looks Like"", ""Oedipus Hex"", ""Silent Night"" and ""Consequences"".  There are four special features included. ""Hill Harper Explores the Body Farm"" -which in the spirit of truth in advertising, is exactly what it says. Be warned, I couldn't watch past the first five minutes or the second corpse, which ever came first. I'm sorry, liquefying human remains in a plastic wheelie bin was much more gruesome than anything I wanted to see over my dinner tray. The other features were a little easier to handle, although still pretty gory:  Those were ""the making of"" features, each focused on the curious aspects of specific episodes. Whoever would have thought of secret codes imbedded in custom-printed tee shirts,  or that the ""Suicide Girls"" is a performing group and a lifestyle. Only in New York, I guess.",1237680000,4,1801,4.970099667774086
2888552,5,B000SO7PCE,I loved this season best because it gave Mac's character a lovely love interest for the entire season. One with a slight accent and very beautiful. But the show itself was great and as usual love the cast.,1235692800,,205,4.421052631578948
2888553,5,B000SO7PCE,"I just love this particular spin off of the original CSI. Way better than CSI Miami. I think the story lines are always credible and the acting is nigh on perfect. It is great to get an ensemble cast that know how to work together, very much like CSI Las Vegas. Keep on going New York. I love it to bits.",1235606400,,304,4.0
2888554,5,B000SO7PCE,"I think this is one of their best seasons yet.  I have been a fan of the CSI series for a while.  I always got annoyed with the way ""H"" from Miami acted.  I liked the original CSI, but I think CSI: NY is the best because not only is New York one of the greatest cities in the US, but it is the way they do the episodes that really draws you in.  One of my favorite episodes is one where Danny and Lindsay process a crime scene where they find a cockroach with some priceless jewels on it.  There are many great episodes throughout the season, and I really like the fact that the hint at the characters personal life, but it doesn't take away from the individual episodes.  I have seen almost every single episode of CSI: NY, including all of the episodes of season 5 that have been made,  and I have to say that my absolute favorite episode is the season 3 finale.  You can't wait to see what is going to happen next, and how the characters are going to resolve the situation that they have been thrown into.  I am excited to see where this show will go.",1234310400,,1054,4.102439024390244
2888555,4,B000SO7PCE,"Is there anything less artistic  than hip hop? it's basically a drum machine and
synthetic music with the sampling of real artists songs who hed the talent to write real music. My friend produces  records and he showed me how there have been about a hundred different number one hip hop songs that are the same song with no change except different vocals.  In the past people rebelled against fake music now they put it on a great show and ruin the whole scene.  Now if a show is about a rap show or something to do with a hip hop music scene, like a episode in season 2 then it's fine to use it the whole episode because it fits.  But shallow electronic music ruins the whole dramatic effect.  The show is well done and the acting is top notch but you must suffer through it's really bad soundtrack that doesn't belong on a drama show.",1226793600,,836,4.292993630573249

2888557,5,B000SO7PCE,"CSI: NY is a great show and I love how well the cast gets along. I especially love Gary Sinise and what he brings to the show as Mac Taylor. He is a combination of William Petersen's Gil Grissom (CSI) and David Caruso's Horatio Caine (CSI: Miami) but with military training. The Third season of CSI: NY was really good and kept you on the edge of your seat with the mystery of Melina Kanakaredes' Stella Bonasera of having HIV or not, also the fact of some of the CSI's being set up and framed for a murder they did not commit. If you have not checked out this show then you need to because even though it has CSI in the title it still has a flavor of it's own.",1208217600,,661,4.0534351145038165
