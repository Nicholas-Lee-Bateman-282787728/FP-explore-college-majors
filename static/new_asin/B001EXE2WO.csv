8299746,3,B001EXE2WO,"OK, so we have five 5 star reviews here on Amazon. Can it be coincidence that there are also five 10 star reviews on IMDB?

Seems someone may have a vested interest in hyping up this film.

Regardless, it is good low budget picture. The sort of film I'll be glad to have in my collection in 20 years time when it's been forgotten.

It has suspense, passable acting and a good premise. Liked the ending too.

Well done to the film makers for a good job on small budget but please, let the quality of the film speak for itself (if indeed it is the film makers posting the top rated reviews).

Mind you, I bought it based on those reviews so they did their job!",1241308800,3,658,4.149606299212598
8299747,1,B001EXE2WO,i struggled through the whole movie..should i turn it off or should i watch it since i already have bought it??? i can not find any positive point about this movie!,1239494400,,164,4.32258064516129
8299748,3,B001EXE2WO,"This was a good movie, but the ending was not an ending at all. I would actually give this one a 2.75.  The mental torture was good, but there was a bit to much talking. As opposed to Jason, Freddy and Michael Myers, this could actually really happen, which added to the suspense. I love the way the director switched sympathies. At first , I looked down on the main character because of the way he dehumanized women, but soon after the two villains showed their true colors and began to torture him I kind of forgot about what a dog he was. This was a pretty good movie. I am still waiting on the ending though. It wasn't given to us in this movie.",1236902400,,649,4.192
8299749,3,B001EXE2WO,"You know, I didn't read any of the reviews before purchasing this film.  It was only after I bought it that I checked out the reviews.  I thought I had made a mistake.  With the exception of 5 VERY SUSPICIOUS 5 star reviews, there were 2 one star ones.  This worried me, but I sat down to watch it anyway, since I had already purchased it.  While watching it, I was pleasantly surprised.  It really wasn't a bad little film.  For being so low-budget, it had pretty decent acting from the 3 leads, a good story line, and some really creative camera work.  I think there's some promise here for these new film makers.  Despite some very obvious plot holes, some very corny music at times, an unsympathetic protagonist, a not very believable ending, and a lack of brutality (I wish the film makers had had the b*lls to be brutal.  It would have been much better), there was good atmosphere, good lighting, some genuine suspense and tension, a good flow to it, and a sense of style.

Filmed in black and white, the story is simple, but effective.  A young man wakes from a drunken stupor (with no memory of the night before) the morning after a huge birthday party thrown for him at his parent's mountain cabin.  While sifting through the mess, he discovers 2 sleeping party goers from the night before that he doesn't recognize.  He wakes them up, and they offer to help him clean up in exchange for a ride back to the resort lodge, but they soon start showing aggression, and their conversation gets very strange.  A little too strange for the young man (they talk about making snuff films), so he asks them to leave.  They refuse, then things get out of hand.

It's a bit unclear if these men really know the young man, but they do seem to, though he doesn't recognize them.  I read here that some people thought that they torture the man for no reason, but they did talk about making snuff films earlier, so, to me, that explains it, considering what their plans turn out to be.  Though there was actually no ""torture"" to speak of, they do torment him.  I wish the film makers had gone all the way with actual scenes of torture, but I understand that making movies is very expensive, so I can forgive small oversights.  And yes, sometimes things happen for no apparent reason, making almost any situation believable to some extent.

All in all, I enjoyed watching this little film.  It's far from perfect, but you can't expect perfection from small indie no-budget films.  If you're only used to seeing big-budget Hollywood films, *GAG*, you will definitely be disappointed, but if you keep an open mind and remember that you're watching an extremely low-budget film that someone put their heart AND money into, you might enjoy it, as I did.  I recommend this film for indie film fans only.  If you're not a fan of these types of films, you should probably avoid it. This film gets ***1/2 stars from me.  Enjoy.",1235260800,,2911,4.537428023032629
8299750,1,B001EXE2WO,"this movie sucked big time for a b movie. here are the reasons

1)the camera work sucked. it looked like it was done by an amateur. there was a seen where it was spinning around alot. i felt like i was goin to hurl.
2)the acting was acceptable but definitely not the best. ive seen better b horror movies. you can tell that the person doing casting just picked decent looking people mainly dudes.
3) the plots where horrible. through half the movie it was the 3 guys talking about what the host was goin to do for the rest of his life. then the a small segment was the host being chased by the two guests. finally the host was bound to the tub while the viewer is puzzled why he is being tortured by the 2 guests.

there isn't any real plus about this movie unless u like to see a quick seen of a Paris Hilton-esque type of home movie on this feature.",1233014400,2,851,4.120481927710843
8299751,1,B001EXE2WO,"I had high hopes for this film, because I've read some great things about it online. So, popping it into the DVD player, I was excited. I write this as I watch the film in digust.

The reviews I have read were misleading, for this movie was not an instant classic, but one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is entirely in black and white (which annoys me), the acting doesn't do it for me, and it's not as scary as I said it was.

The idea for the plot is very stupid. Two guys just appear in his house, and he doesn't do anything for about a half hour? It doesn't make much sense to me, and it is very bad.

Overall, I'd say avoid this movie, because it is definitely one of the worst I've seen.",1230163200,5,701,3.992857142857143
8299752,5,B001EXE2WO,"Hospitality is definitely the thinking person's thriller. Extremely insightful and witty-- the dialogue was absolutely riveting and the actor's well chosen and well rehearsed.
Many times in real life there is no true or justifiable motive for the horrific events that occur and I was pleased, from a movie point of view, that this was also true in the movie.
Kudos to the team and I certainly look forward to more thrillers in the near future.",1226448000,,443,4.842105263157895
8299753,5,B001EXE2WO,"About time!

This psychological thriller packs a big punch. The story line wasn't far fetched from reality. The writing was witty, giving the perfect balance of comedy and drama. This movie kept my Lady and I on the edge of our seats. The producer used only one location and told a big story ( Brilliant ). I could only imagine what this indi film maker would do if he was giving one of those big Hollywood budgets!",1223424000,,415,4.3896103896103895
8299754,5,B001EXE2WO,"This movie is so raw. You come away profoundly disturbed... but fulfilled! And you don't have to be a horror movie enthusiast to appreciate this film. Brilliant writing, quirky and engaging characters, awesome score, a richly innovative story... Just a cinematic treat.",1222473600,,269,5.428571428571429
8299755,5,B001EXE2WO,"If you are looking for a real scare and a unique ending, this is a must purchase.  I saw it at the original screening.  Can't wait to add it to the permanent library.  Great Indy flick with a talented cast and director/writer/producer.",1221868800,,235,4.5476190476190474
