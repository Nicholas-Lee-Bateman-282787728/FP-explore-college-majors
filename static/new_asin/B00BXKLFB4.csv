5680611,5,B00BXKLFB4,"I have been watching a lot of Birthing/ Parenting videos and I have to say this series is a ""must see"". It is comprehensive and very interesting. With so many experts in different fields, you can really get a nice balanced picture of each of the topics covered. This series is fresh and informative and I highly recommend adding it to your knowledge base. Especially in today's routine-driven medical system when everyone is treated as a statistic and you really have many more options about your care than the doctors and hospitals lead you to believe.",1366588800,2,553,4.770833333333333
5680612,5,B00BXKLFB4,"My wife just bought this series and ""made"" me watch it with her. I actually have never written a review but I was so impressed with these four videos that I wanted to share a guy's point of view. Honestly, now I can't imagine trying to make it through my wife's birth being as clueless as I was before we watched them. We actually went to a hospital childbirth class and pretty much learned nothing about the info in them. After watching, my wife decided that she wants to try for a natural birth which I would have never encouraged in the past but now totally get. We also decided that we definitely want to have a doula there to support us both.. ha! Also, although, not an area of interest up to this point in my life, I found all the information on breastfeeding fascinating... and holy cow, in case we are having a boy, I can't imagine not understanding all about circumcisions before making that decision. My wife has been reading lots of books and although I keep telling her that I am going to read them to and I did want to...kind of... we now both feel like I have gotten all the essentials and more. I would totally recommend this to all of my friends. Dads, you too!",1365724800,23,1178,4.3108108108108105
5680613,5,B00BXKLFB4,"I just finished watching this series....UNBELIEVABLE!!!!... I thought I was well informed as a mom to be until I watched this DVD.... It covers EVERYTHING you could possibly think of when it comes to pregnancy, birth and life with your new baby.  It is refreshing to see all my options presented by experts that I trust and not just one persons point of view.  I would recommend Happy Healthy Child to anyone that is planning to become pregnant, who is currently pregnant or even mothers who have already delivered...I would even recommend that dads and grandparents watch this! The information in this series goes beyond the basics and brings awareness to all the important topics surrounding becoming a parent.",1365552000,,712,4.974789915966387
5680619,5,B00BXKLFB4,"A wonderful gift! Beautifully presented and a treasure for all! Perfect for anyone who is in anyway interested or involved with pregnancy, childbirth and life itself-isn't this everyone?!:)",1435881600,,189,5.785714285714286
5680620,5,B00BXKLFB4,This collection is absolutely amazing and a must see by all expecting parents. There is so much information condensed here that makes you aware of the decisions you can make to have a healthy and happy journey.,1434326400,,210,4.702702702702703
5680621,5,B00BXKLFB4,"Not only have I gotten the experience of watching this incredible DVD series, I've gotten the gift of meeting Sarah Kamrath, and participating in a weeklong pregnancy teachers training with her.
Sarah is an enlightened and beautiful being who has connected the dots of medical science, holistic health care and ancient wisdom. This is not a spiritual airy fairy view on pregnancy and motherhood. This is a practical DVD series for the pioneering and conscious woman (and man) ready to claim the health for themselves, their baby and their family.
I can't recommend enough.",1432944000,,572,5.095744680851064
5680622,4,B00BXKLFB4,"I teach the Bradley Method and use portions of these DVD's to supplement my classes. I really enjoy what they add to what I teach. I also like that they are divided up, which makes them very user friendly to view particular topics as needed. I have been in contact with Sarah, and she is very gracious and generous; she truly just wants to help others have access to good information regarding childbirth!",1432771200,,405,4.561643835616438

5680625,5,B00BXKLFB4,"I purchased this series to use in the natural childbirth classes I teach, and they are a wonderful complement to my curriculum! There is so much misinformation surrounding birth, so much blind trust in the status quo, and it's so wonderful to have access to such a wealth of experts daring to challenge that thinking. This series is not anti-hospital, but it represents the evidence-based position that our culture's intervention-happy approach to birth is doing more harm than good for moms, babies, families, and our society as a whole. Somewhere along the way we stopped trusting our bodies and started fearing what we were born to do and do well. Time and again studies have shown that under normal circumstances, natural pregnancy, childbirth and parenting are the best way to assure a ""happy, healthy child"", and this is not bias, it's reality, and it can happen anywhere a family chooses to begin their journey, be it hospital, home, or elsewhere. Thank you, Sarah and friends, for providing the world with this wonderful collection of wisdom! (My students appreciate getting to hear some voices other than my own once in a while! ;))",1429056000,,1141,4.947916666666667
5680626,3,B00BXKLFB4,"This is either a five star product or a two star product, depending on what you're looking for.

If you're looking for a DVD substitute for birth classes this is not for you. There is very little detail about the actual labor process, what to expect, and/or how to manage pain. If you wish to know more about natural birth then watch these videos. They are well made with a little bad audio depending on which expert is being interviewed. Multiple, renowned experts discuss hospital procedures and why they usually lead to more interventions. We were already on board with natural birth, so this series was redundant to what we already knew. We were looking for more of a birth class in a box. Laugh and Learn meets this need much better than Happy Healthy Child.",1429056000,,763,4.610294117647059
5680627,5,B00BXKLFB4,Truly an excellent resource for new parents. Watch with an open mind and make your own decisions. Buying a second set for a friend.,1428796800,,131,4.5
5680628,1,B00BXKLFB4,"This is a very pro ""all natural"" childbirth video which is not in the product description at all. If you plan on having your baby in a hospital, save yourself the money and get a different video.",1428796800,,195,4.297297297297297
5680629,1,B00BXKLFB4,"I like organic produce and herbal tea as much as the next person, but this video was just over-the-top new-agey, spiritual mumbo-jumbo propaganda. It even shows suffering farm animals in the first 30 minutes when talking about a good pregnancy diet. I did NOT order a childbirth video to be taught about where my food comes from and how my energy and feelings should be positive and uplifting. I wouldn't mind some input from midwives and doulas and naturopathic doctors, as long as it's combined with science and practice and facts. This was absurd. One guy even said ""Everything that grows in the ground, everything that grows on a tree, everything that walks on the earth, and everything that swims in the sea-- that is what you want to eat"". Really?!? Everything?? I should eat cats? This guys was a kook!  And honestly, I am a very positive, relaxed, mindful person. This video was just insulting. What a waste of time.",1428364800,2,924,4.739130434782608
5680630,5,B00BXKLFB4,"Happy Healthy Child combines exceptional filmmaking with uncommon birth wisdom  Congratulations to all the parents to be who buy this set - especially those planning a hospital birth.  This DVD gives you what you need to know: Straightforward, practical, life changing information.  Bravissimo Sarah!",1423699200,,300,5.7727272727272725
5680631,5,B00BXKLFB4,"This is one of the most comprehensive and time-efficient ways of gaining the vital and enlightening information required to nurture you through pregnancy, birth and beyond. It highlights how birth works when we don't interfere with it (and how it can go awry when we do) and educates as to the impact of birth choices, common birth interventions and early parenting choices. All the while, it guides you gently and with feeling towards the most nurturing choices for mother and baby. Backed up by science and reseach data it makes a compelling case. The fact that the collection of renowned professionals interviewed include a number of OB/GYNs adds weight to the recommendations put forward.

As founder of Syntonic Birth, I particularly welcomed the mention of how beliefs and expectations determine outcomes at birth, not only of the expectant parents but also - crucially - the birth professionals who attend them, hence the need for alignment between all those within the birthing environment. SUCH an important but much-overlooked area in the realm of birth preparation.

This is great for blokes to watch to realise the important contribution they can make to the welfare of their unborn child. It includes helpful questions to ask your care provider to help you decide where, how and with whom to give birth.
This is also a must see for birth professionals too. It includes practitioners who show a lot of humility about having practised for years to the detriment of women and their babies, simply by following common practises without questioning, until they knew better.

In short, unless you are very enlightened and have done a heck of a lot of the right reading, you are unlikely to make truly informed choices about birth and parenting without this, even for many birth professionals. Buy it, watch it, share it, recommend it!

It's important to note however, that this provides information and advice only (as well as positive footage). You do then have to put the advice into action in order to prepare yourself for birth. As the title suggests, this is childbirth education, not childbirth preparation. Ultimately, trust in the wisdom contained in these DVDs and you will go a long way to producing a happy, healthy child and having a birth experience you can look back on with relish rather than regret!",1419120000,,2322,4.97680412371134
5680632,5,B00BXKLFB4,"What a fantastic DVD set, perfect for EVERYONE, whether you are having a baby yourself or if you know somebody else who is! When I received this set I watched all four hours on the same day. I met with a friend who is due to give birth next week and was able to help her write a very well informed birth plan. She was completely unaware that she was ""allowed"" to make requests such a delayed cord clamping or keeping her baby on her chest rather than him being whisked off to be cleaned and weighed. Her OB/GYN had told her that ""all babies"" have their cord cut straight away and that she would ""have to"" be separated from her baby for 3 hours during the first day and she was left feeling as though she had no choice - something that I have heard from a lot of first time mother's who naturally feel in a very vulnerable position! I feel EMPOWERED sharing this information with all my expectant friends and family and they in turn feel empowered and confident knowing that they know what best for their baby! PRICELESS!!",1419033600,,1021,4.322916666666667
5680633,5,B00BXKLFB4,"Wonderful! These 4 dvds have all the information you need for an empowered and fulfilling experience of pregnancy, birth and parenting. I have read almost all of the books by the experts interviewed and wish I just could have watched this! It's an invaluable ressource. Share it with all your pregnant friends and anyone interested in a holistic approach to the beginnings of life.",1417392000,,381,4.96875
5680634,5,B00BXKLFB4,"I loved this DVD.The information was clearly presented and very practical. The list of questions to ask practitioners is one that every pregnant woman should have.  Being trained in Montessori, I especially appreciated the section on bonding.",1413590400,,242,5.54054054054054

5680636,5,B00BXKLFB4,"An amazing preparation for a natural birth!!!! The best baby shower present you can give yourself or anyone else expecting a baby! High quality information, presented in a 'user friendly' manner. Even if you are well read in the subject, I'm sure you will find little gems of information here, from experts recognised around the world. A long term investment. Enjoy!",1407110400,,366,5.016393442622951
5680637,5,B00BXKLFB4,"These series are simply amazing! Its such an incredible work of a filmmaker to gather all this valuable information in such a beautiful and compact way. Each and single family planning to have a baby or being pregnant SHOULD watch it. We often think we know enough or thats the way things should be or even worse I know nothing about it, I have no control over it, so I leave it to others. It is so essential to go beyond what we know, to explore the unknown, to educate oneself, especially as parents-to-be. Its just a beginning of an amazing learning curve. These childbirth education series are perfectly designed to teach you what you may have had no idea about. Nothing will be the same after you watch it. And its worth every penny. I cannot imagine a more beautiful gift to expecting parents!",1406592000,,799,4.517241379310345

5680659,5,B00BXKLFB4,"Thought this DVD was going to be really boring, but it was incredibly informative. If you're planning a natural childbirth, like I am, than it might seem a bit redundant, but the different speakers really went in depth and helped to solidify my decision. It's definitely geared toward the holistic-minded, but anybody with an open mind who wants to be induced and given an epidural would greatly benefit from watching this video as well.",1401321600,,437,4.918918918918919
5680660,3,B00BXKLFB4,"If you are not convinced in having a natural birth at home or at a birthing center and practicing attachment techniques in parenting and you want to be convinced to do so, then you may want to watch this series.  Now don't get me wrong, I had natural births, one at home and one at the hospital.  I breastfed my baby till he was 2 years old.  But I was hoping to find a nice practical childbirth education series to give to my sister who is planning a hospital birth and really needs practical advice.  I was disappointed that almost one complete DVD in this series is spent proving that home birth or birthing center is ideal for normal pregnancy.  By the time women think about a childbirth education series, they cannot really negotiate their birth location.  They could have spent that time demonstrating to women practical techniques for natural birth in all three locations (home, center, hospital), instead of spending one short 10 to 15 minute chapter on romanticizing natural coping techniques.  Breastfeeding education was also sparse, with significant time spent trying to show why it is ""best"" or superior to formula.  This video series is more about philosophy and values than practical help for upcoming parents.  So if you are looking for a philosophy surrounding birth, then this is for you.  It did not meet my purposes for a PRACTICAL childbirth education.",1397001600,19,1374,4.833333333333333
5680661,5,B00BXKLFB4,A must watch for anyone interested in the holistic ins and outs of pregnancy and beyond. Good to watch even if you haven't taken any in-person childbirth education but I recommend that you do both!  Some really important information is found here!,1395878400,,247,4.880952380952381
5680662,5,B00BXKLFB4,"The subjects covered in this series of DVDs is a midwife's dream come true!  Very informative, educational, supports wellness in pregnancy and beyond and debunks the myths people have been lead to  believe in for so long with regards to pregnancy and childbirth.  We live in a culture that has completely stripped the woman's power away from her and left her believing that she is incapable of carrying and/or birthing her child without a barrage of medical interventions.  This DVD is a regular educational handout  to all my mothers, whether it is their first pregnancy or tenth!  Sincerely, appreciative midwife!",1395878400,3,615,5.1
5680663,5,B00BXKLFB4,"Whether you like it or not pregnancy is a holistic experience...

As a practicing prenatal and pediatric chiropractor it is very refreshing to see a DVD set like this come out. Yes it does cover primarily the holistic side of birth but as I tell all of my patients. Whether you like it or not, the world (and your family's health) is holistic. Kudos to Sarah Kamrath!

This is a much-needed educational series that yes, if your experience has been primarily conventional western medicine,  might make you uncomfortable. BUT there is a very important reason for that... Holistic is not a choice. Whether you believe it or not, It is actually the way the world works and we all know it deep down but don't know what to do when it's in our face.

If you are new to the holistic side, start slow... when the practitioners in the DVD suggest that you ""ask your doctor"" questions, write them down and get your answers. Baby Monitoring, Ultrasounds, Ptocin, Epidurals, C-sections, being able to ""move"" while in labor and deliver in a squatting or side-lying position, etc. all matter holistically. Meaning they affect much more than we all think!

As an example, laying on your back alone closes the birth canal by 25% by changing the angle of your sacrum and it also locks the sacrum in the pelvis keeping it from expanding and contracting during labor. From a holistic sense, this can slow labor times, increase levels of pain, stall birth, and lead to more interventions. A dynamic pelvis allows for baby's cranium to pump and this is  influential on starting baby's cerebrospinal fluid pump (cranial rhythmic pulse) that has a significant effect on brain development and nervous system health. The pumping of labor is beneficial for baby's breathing.

In the end, it's all about peace of mind. That is all I want for my patients.... some choose conventional medicine and I love them just as much as those that choose to focus on holistic. But I teach my patients that blind faith in either side is still blind. Watch the DVD, find answers to the questions that come up and then find your peace as parents. In my opinion, real peace is through education but at the same time, real peace is actually yours to decide upon and no one else's. Not your doctors, not your chiropractors, not your parents...

This series is going on my office shelves! It enhances my ability to educate my expecting moms and dads and even though I focus on pregnancy and baby in my office, I learned a lot from the best in the field. Thank you Sarah and all those involved!",1393891200,6,2545,4.652561247216036

5680665,5,B00BXKLFB4,"Making informed decisions in today's world of industry and healthcare involves gathering information and searching all available credible sources.  In the realm of pregnancy, ""Happy Healthy Child"" is a resource that should be on every newly pregnant mom's list.

I absolutely LOVED this video series. Not only are the content and the interviewees amazing, but the documentary is presented from a very heartfelt place. I cried at the end of some of the videos. I think these videos present information in a very riveting way, covering topics from pregnancy, birth and life with a young child. They are comprehensive and will have any parent hooked. Its a MUST watch for any parents to be, those who want to have kids at some point and are not yet pregnant and also mothers of newborns. You will be so glad you did.",1383868800,,728,4.4

It is everything I want my clients to see, and saves us all so much time and effort. Instead of me providing documents, links and spending hours in instruction, couples can now hear it all from the best Dr.'s, Midwives and specialists in the field, for themselves. The series is organized in a perfect way, offering just the right amount of info, without being overwhelming. It is entertaining, meaningful and tasteful! Now, when I work with couples, I can focus on more personal material and the hands on components I should be doing, instead of explaining the why's of everything. This series is the exact light that is needed to shine on the Birthing field right now! I have seen educational DVD's for 4 times the price, which are not even half as good as this! I recommend it to anyone getting ready to have a family, anyone already pregnant, anyone who loves anyone pregnant and anyone in the birthing field who works with anyone who is pregnant or wants to be! I am so relieved to have such a wonderful product for my clients!",1375747200,2,1177,4.690821256038648
5680692,5,B00BXKLFB4,"I thought I did my research for our first (home) birth....a dream team of a doula, midwife, midwife assistant, back up OBGYN, + 6 wks of child education classes.... Fast forward two years later, we are about ten days away from the (home) birth of our second child and I feel even MORE EMPOWERED after watching this Series.  This series is a must for first time birthers who want to balance the mainstream way of pregnancy, self care, birthing, and caring for your new baby, with expert interviews on both sides...allopathic care (OBGYNs) and natural birth care (doulas, midwives, etc). If you want to feel confident that you truly did your research before making your choice of how you will birth your baby...at home, a birthing center, a hospital...then you must watch this series. And there is so much more to this Series then just birthing. It includes topics on caring for your baby...from skin-to-skin contact immediately upon birth, breastfeeding, circumcision, + vaccination.  And if I may suggest, after you view it, sit still with all the information and reflect on the possibility that the intention of these experts and the director/producer/creator of this Series is to advise, empower, educate, and share what they feel is their Truth. One may become defensive. Understandable...especially if they are challenged to dig more deeply and possibly change (or go against) their belief systems from mainstream pregnancy, birthing, and newborn baby care...to shift their paradigms...and possibly go against even family and friends. So if you feel angry or confused...get quiet and still. Listen to your heart. To your baby. Stay awake to the signs that guide you towards even more information and dialogue. And then decide what's right for you. That's one of the important messages I got from this Series.  After watching this Series, you can feel confident that you did some really thorough research on the ""alternative"" (perhaps soon to become mainstream again) path of birthing.  For the sake of your baby's happiness...for the sake of the human race, purchase and share this with as many moms and dads to be as you can. Be the change...that is ALREADY happening in the world.",1374624000,3,2186,5.0470914127423825
5680693,5,B00BXKLFB4,"I am pregnant and am so grateful to have these video tools as a guide to having a happy, healthy baby. It is wisdom from experts in the field that express valuable and actionable options for parents to consider.
In my opinion, it's really important to inform ourselves on all possible routes for a healthy birthing experience and the years that follow. I am empowered because I watched Happy Healthy Child. It opened my eyes to a fundamental difference from the normal vantage point a mother has through her network of family and friends and the medical establishment. Typically, pregnancy is full of adjectives like fear and pain, shifting the power of 'success' to drugs while essentially removing the mother's power and strength from the equation. I now am assured that my body knows how to give birth and that it is a normal event and not a medical procedure as many perceive it to be. I am confident now that I am equipped with these tools and feel, regardless of the outcome (natural birth or c-section), that I did my best and made the right decisions for me and my baby. I am surrendering to what is.

What an incredibly informative and refreshing video series! As a professional videographer, the production quality is top-notch. From a content perspective, the messages are profound. It's difficult to imagine combining a more impressive line-up of interview subjects than what is in this series. So well done! Highly recommend Happy Healthy Child!!!!",1372204800,,1461,4.867469879518072
5680694,2,B00BXKLFB4,"I am really surprised with all the 5 star reviews.  I am wondering if these reviews were written immediately after watching the series, without each person taking some time to let the content settle in, and then conducting their own respective research with their doctors and other resources.  This set only covers a Holistic Approach to childbirth.  This set does not offer any other approaches ie, the typical hospital experience.  Now, I will say this set has opened my eyes and helped me by giving me insight and information not known otherwise.  The issue I have is that the program is anti medicine and anti US hospital practice regarding birth.  The content  almost scares you if you are giving birth in a hospital, and I don't feel that is fair to OBGYN's and or conventional medicine.  I was blindsided immediately after watching and for a split second was 'brainwashed' and felt similar to the other people posting 5 star reviews.  Then the dust settled and I started doing my own research. This included first hand interviews with friends that had both natural and epidurals as well as my doctor, nurses and valid online resources.  It's a lot to think about and cover but important for me to make an informed decision, not an impulsive one because of One viewpoint.  As new parents we are faced with many decisions, some not easy.  I have two months before our little one arrives and I am still researching and checking inn with myself to ask those important questions, ""whats best for me""?  How do I want to feel during labor? What are my fears? Etc, etc.  If you are curious about natural childbirth and or curious about a holistic approach then this will be great for you, but then you probably already know all that this set provides.  If you are just curious about a hospital birth, have faith in your OB and aren't an earthy, natural type but you are ok with the status quo then do not waste your money.  The two star review is mainly because the description is misleading and says nothing about what this series is really about.  It it completely a  one sided point of view and I didn't appreciate that.  I hope this helps you.",1372118400,8,2146,4.614775725593668

5680696,5,B00BXKLFB4,"Happy Healthy Child is a fabulous resource.  You would have to read 30+ Books and attend many workshops for this kind of Holistic Child raising content.  This is great for parents who do not have access to holistic child birth classes.  It is also a good way to involve your spouse without expecting them to do tons of reading.  These DVD's touch on so many important topics from the top holistic Drs, Phd's, Midwives, Rn's, and childbirth experts.  This would make a perfect baby shower gift.",1370304000,,493,4.686046511627907

The information is so poignant and important, presented in an empowering way, leaving me way more excited and informed about the birth process (and my options).  Personally I experienced quite a few practitioners beating the drum of fear around birth, yet in this series, the women, families and medical professionals provide a breath of fresh air for a healthy happy empowered birth.  Very well done would recommend it to men and women alike.",1494201600,,536,4.933333333333334

8575088,5,B00BXKLFB4,"ABSOLUTELY A MUST VIEW FOR NEW PARENTS!!! I just had my firstborn son last Friday totally natural and no drugs or etra surgery and this series was an integral part of an amazingly comprehensive and loving experience we had with Babies By The Sea birthing center!! Please if you want to know more about natural childbirth and the way doctors and the entire American health care system, is only out to save their own asses and could care less about your well-being or informing you of your options and rights, get these tapes and pass them on!!! And if you are in the southern California area and expecting, then please call Babies By The Sea birthing center in Encinitas, Ca they are absolutely incredible and my wife and I can not thank them enough for the wonderfully informative and loving experience we had with them, which is the opposite of the horrible experience we had with our local doctors....... dr. Perea at Hemet hospital might as well be Hitler reincarnated...... but yes love Love LOVE THESE TAPES!!!",1459900800,,1015,4.740112994350283
8575089,5,B00BXKLFB4,"I am a doula and work with pregnant families, and this four part series is an incredible source of information that helps answer so many questions new families to be have. I would honestly say that watching these videos will give you more relevant and empowering information than the childbirth education classes recommended to you by your hospital. These documentaries are a fearless, enlightening examination of our culture's medical and societal relationship to birth. You'll find answers to questions not many doctors and hospitals are answering, an attention to fact checking, and an honest exploration of the choices we have when deciding to become pregnant, give birth, and raise a child. These films are a must see-I can't tell you how helpful they have been in educating myself and the parents I work with.",1458777600,,815,5.08955223880597
8575090,5,B00BXKLFB4,"I watched these DVDs after I gave birth but I wish they were around when I was going through my first birth. Sarah has interviewed some of the top in the field of birthing and asked tough questions to inform the mama and partner about the birthing experience. Plus there are pregnancy and post natal DVDs too. When birthing in a hospital there can be so much one sided information about the medical side of things. These DVDs speak about the natural process of your growing fetus to the birth to the anthropological bonding between mama and baby. If your instincts are telling you one thing and society is not reflecting those thoughts, this is for you. You will gain practical knowledge and feel support to help you in this magical transformation.",1451088000,,748,4.674242424242424
8575091,3,B00BXKLFB4,"I love the idea behind the video and all of the information contained within, but calling it a childbirth education course is misleading. You won't learn everything that you would from a childbirth educator. And to be honest, after watching this I felt like a massive failure when things went wrong and we needed a number of medical interventions. I think a less biased, and more... anatomical? biological? approach might be more beneficial for a first time mom.",1448841600,,462,4.935897435897436
