8354101,5,B00275KIOY,"This is that rarest of birds, an independently produced animated feature meant for adults. Obviously it's satire, mostly aimed at Islamist extremism but almost a pointedly at George W. Bush, the media, fundamentalist Christianity and the kind of wrong-headed political correctness that sees throwing acid at a girl because she wants to go to school is a cultural choice as valid as any other. The character designs are excellent, and the parody ""I Love Prakhbar"" (""I Love Lucy"" with Osama as Ricky Ricardo) is worth the price of admission.",1363478400,,539,5.067415730337078
8354102,5,B00275KIOY,"A hilarious, well-done animated comedy about the downfalls of extremism. Simple, yet expressive, animation; fresh and colorful design work; and toe-tapping, funny-bone-tickling musical numbers. Independent animated features are hard to come by, and entertaining ones are even rarer. ""Bye-Bye Bin Laden"" is a surprisingly smart and funny film.",1253404800,2,342,6.145833333333333
