8153925,3,B000K29AD6,"This is ok, but nearly as good as Buck's 7-part DVD series.  This video was clearly made a long time ago.  If you only need groundwork instruction and nothing else, this might be good enough.  Otherwise, spend the extra money and get the 7-part series.",1449619200,,252,4.555555555555555

8153928,5,B000K29AD6,"this is a video that you'll need to watch and try and watch again.......and each time watch more closely for the subtle hints and clues

the only thing is i wish they had a complete session no breaks.....with one critter....and rider....and then again.

as a newbie wrangler and longtime horse owner......i just did a 3 day Wilde to broke client.....and then watch these and buck is a master.....i see the light...the clues....but for a newbie....it is overload......so be patient and keep trying......if not you'll have a best friend......and learned so much.......so don't expect a miracle on your first try....like but says practice practise.....and it will come ....its really about communication both ways and this gentle-ING and not breaking a horse",1410048000,7,755,5.283333333333333

8153932,5,B000K29AD6,"I had the pleasure of being present to see Buck Brannaman working with horses and their owners at the Hoosier Horse Fair last year.  It was enjoyable to see the way he handled himself and his horse.  He explained the reasoning behind each thing that he did.  The DVD was very informative I have watched it several times.  It is like a good movie, you always see something you missed before.  There were so many things made sense when you saw the effect of the actions.",1365811200,4,468,4.395348837209302
