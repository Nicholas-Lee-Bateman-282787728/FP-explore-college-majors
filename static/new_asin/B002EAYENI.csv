8367319,2,B002EAYENI,"Though MASSAGING ADAMS's producers might deny it, ""Adam"" has long been sort of a gay ""buzz word"" evoking images of an attractive nude male. Don't be fooled by what may be implied in any blurb about this piece of work. Even though the actual video has a warning label about models being over 18 AND that viewers of the DVD should be over 18 (and I am, by a lot :-) there is nothing here that a 3-year-old shouldn't see. The video shows less skin than one would see at the average country club swimming pool. There is absolutely NOTHING erotic, suggestive or sexual here. The two models (a male and a female) are just average in their looks and there seems little to learn about massage that would not already be common sense to most intuitive adults.
