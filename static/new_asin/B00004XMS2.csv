1367350,5,B00004XMS2,"I have had the pleasure of viewing this three-pack of action movies, and let me say this:  There is no better sound than DTS (for now).  If you love Mel Gibson or the Lethal Weapon Series, this is the one to get.  Sure there's a four-pack of movies, but I've viewed them too, and well, there is not the quality that you get with this three pack.  Trust me I fought tooth and nail for the other set, but viewing them both showed the four-pack is just not as good as this set, especially for the price.  Suggestion:  Get this set then get Lethal Weapon 4 seperately if you want.  It's cheaper in the long run, too!",973382400,44,612,4.17948717948718
1367351,3,B00004XMS2,"Lethal Weapon, along with Die Hard are the most mimicked action movies.  The original Lethal Weapon was o.k., but Glover and Gibson did have good  chemistry.  I have not seen the second yet, but I hear its the best. Lethal  Weapon 3 was pretty good, but Joe Pesci was annoying! Lethal Weapon 4 was  good and I found it a fun summer flick.  All in all I don't think The  Director's Cut will add anything.  It's not like there will be anymore  action sequences.  And with films like these how good do you think any  added character scenes will be? They'll probably feel very stilted",966124800,2,580,4.428571428571429

1367370,5,B00004XMS2,"This DVD set deal includes the first three movies of the Lethal Weapon series.

LETHAL WEAPON is the first movie in the series and introduces the unlikely cop team of Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). Murtaugh is fifty-years old and a veteran officer. Riggs is an up-and-coming star of the police force, known for his atypical style. They are partnered together and become close friends while working to bring down a major drug cartel. Besides being just a good movie, LETHAL WEAPON is also notable for being the movie that made Mel Gibson a box officer superstar in the United States. Mel became famous because of Mad Max, but it was LETHAL WEAPON that made him a household name in the U.S.

LETHAL WEAPON 2 continues a few years after LETHAL WEAPON. Murtaugh and Riggs are still partners. Once again they are on a drug case, but this time it's an international drug ring of diplomats from South Africa with diplomatic immunity. They are also put in charge of protecting a key witness and informant, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who becomes a great secondary character in the series. Also, Riggs falls in love and pulls a house off a cliff. As a bit of trivia, Riggs was supposed to die in this one, but the studio called for a rewrite knowing how successful the franchise would be.

The Lethal Weapon series was going to be a trilogy wrapped up with the retirement of Murtaugh at the end of the third film, LETHAL WEAPON 3. After thirty-years on the force, Murtaugh is finally going to retire. However, eight days before the big event he and Riggs become involved in a case of gun running and cops gone bad. Riggs finds lasting love with an internal affairs officer, Lorna Cole (Rene Russo). Leo Getz also returns. This film is the weakest of the Lethal Weapon movies and the studio wisely decided to bring everyone back for one last film.

Overall, this is a good collection for a great price. The movies are in widescreen format in the director's cut versions. The only thing that could make this collection better would be to have included LETHAL WEAPON 4, something the studio did a few years later. If you've never seen the films, this would be a good DVD collection to check out. However, if you're a fan of the series, I'd recommend purchasing the DVD collection that has all four movies in it.",1366329600,,2322,4.601449275362318
1367371,5,B00004XMS2,"Watching Riggs and Murtaugh in action NEVER gets old. Riggs leap before you look and Murtaugh's let's just wait for backup attitudes are hilarious, throw in Joe Pesci's Leo Getz and you will never tire of these classics.",1366156800,,220,4.815789473684211

1367387,5,B00004XMS2,"I bought this yesterday with my Bestbuy giftcard and now I highly recommend if you want the first three films, you should get this.

Pros

+ All three films are on two disc (The first disc double sided and the first one is on one side and the second one is on the other).

+ They are the same DVDs you get if you bought them separately so you don't lose anything.

+ It's Cheap!

Cons

There are no cons really but these might be to some people.

- You don't have the disc artwork for 1 or 2
- You don't have the snap cases.
- The Aspect Ratio is incorrect on the back of the case.  The first film has a different ratio than 2 & 3.  2 & 3 are the same.

Warner did a great job with this set alright.  Highly recommended.",1174780800,2,720,3.863013698630137
1367388,2,B00004XMS2,"Buyers should know that the widescreen aspect ratio listed for LETHAL WEAPON 2 and LETHAL WEAPON 3 are incorrect.  They say they're 1:85.1, when they are actually 2:35.1.  I found this out the hard way, after I'd opened the package.

1367392,5,B00004XMS2,"The previous reviewer is correct on all points, which prompted me to purchase this over the Director Cut Editions individually.

What makes it even better is the DTS audio tracks are full bitrate @1536Kb/s!  Most, if not all, DTS DVD's are half-bit rate @768Kb/s (Saving Private Ryan, Jaws, Lord of the Rings Trilogy).

Getting three great films in one package, widescreen, and w/full bitrate DTS for $11 is a once in a life time deal.",1163894400,18,435,4.773333333333333
1367393,5,B00004XMS2,"Okay, let me start by saying you're not going to get any reviews on any of these three movies from me. Anyone who lived through the late 80's and early 90's already know the action greatness of these films that launched Mel Gibson from just being known as ""Mad Max"". No, my review is solely based on the new ""Warner Bros. Triple Feature"" packaging of the first three movies in the Lethal Weapon series.

On November 7th 2006, Warner Bros released 23 DVD titles from their library with three films in each case with varied subjects like trilogies, westerns, star's films, animals, and others. But probably the best bang for your buck is this Lethal Weapon set (maybe, maybe the second would be the camp-horror classic ""It's Alive"" trilogy, which I'll be getting as well). Yes it's true, SOME of these titles will bother most videophiles because quite a few titles offered in these triple features are FULL FRAME only when originally they may have been released in Widescreen when first appeared on DVD (see the Free Willy, Poison Ivy, and 15 Minutes triple features for those disapointments). But not, I repeat NOT, the Lethal Weapon one. This one has all three films presented in Widescreen with the original 5.1 AND DTS audio tracks. To put it simply, you get all three films as they were originally released separately on DVD back in 2000: the Director Cut editions, nothing has been changed whatsoever.

I've read videophiles say, ""Well then, since it's THREE movies on only TWO discs, the compression has to be weaker"". Wrong. Here's the disc set-up: Lethal Weapon's One and Two are on ONE disc, but it's a DVD-18, otherwise known as ""double-sided/dual-layered"". Both these movies were released in 2000 as DVD-9's (one-sided/dual-layered). Meaning, it's the EXACT compression as originally, but now you just have to ""flip"" the disc over to get to the other movie. And the second disc is exactly the same as before, with the Lethal Weapon 3 disc artwork on label & as a DVD-9. So you see, the only thing you really lose in buying this over the 2000 box set is two DVD cases and three discs instead of what you get now, two. I'm pretty sure that's the compression/set-up for all the Triple Feature titles, but Warner chose to instead press the Full Frame side on some of these titles instead of the Widescreen. Why, I have no idea.

Also a plus is the price. At Wal-Mart, I paid only $9.00 dollars for the Lethal Weapon triple feature. Even if I found all three titles separately in the ""bargin-bin"", I'd still pay at least $15.00 dollars for them. This version is cheaper, but just as good. And the normal suggested retail price is still cheaper than buying them apart, so this really is the way to go.

Finally, alot of fans of the Lethal Weapon series also have claimed ""Why not include Lethal Weapon 4?"". Well, One: all these releases are under the ""Triple Feature"" title, not a ""Quadruple"" one, Two: this one also features ""The Unrated Director's Cuts"" when 4 was released as ""Theatrical Rated R"", and Three: alot of people just didn't like 4 to begin with (not me, I thought bringing in Jet-Li really added to the franchise). So that should explain that!

So, if you're on the fence about buying this new ""Lethal Weapon Triple Feature"", I say do it...but only if you don't own the single Director Cut discs already...because you won't get anything new here. And look at each other Triple Feature title's back cover to see if it's Widescreen or not, and could you live with the Full Frame version of the other titles at such a low cost. So: 3 stars for the entire ""Warner Bros. Triple Feature"" line, 5 stars for the ""Lethal Weapon"" title from it.",1163721600,69,3653,4.657364341085271
1367394,5,B00004XMS2,"I just bought this Director's Cut set, and I still love these Lethal Weapon movies as much as the day I first saw them. There's simply not a better series of buddy cop movies ever made, especially because the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is just superb.

With that said, I write this after the sad news about Mel Gibson's DUI arrest, and the charges that he said some anti-semitic comments. All I can say is this. The man has a messed up father, and because of that Mel has had some demons of his own. I believe that he needs to resolve some issues, and I think he will. He's not running and hiding people. He's admitted his transgressions and is doing something to get help. Maybe, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if we didn't try to tear down every great icon of this country? Maybe instead could we give this man some support, and help him overcome his problems? Don't discredit a life full of achievements because of one mistake.",1154563200,4,953,4.4147727272727275

Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make a wonderful team together...just wish they had made more movies together continuing the Lethal Weapon series.

I would recommend buying this to all my friends.",1152403200,2,366,4.950819672131147
1367396,4,B00004XMS2,"I absoultely love the Lethal Weapon Movies!  You cannot deny that the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is brilliant.  Many people already know the stories behind the Lethal Weapon Movies so this review just focuses on the actual DVDs themselves.  First of all do not get the original Lethal Weapon DVD box set because this Legacy box set contains the Directors Cuts of the first three movies, whereas the other original box set contains the theatrical versions. The directors cut versions all include additional scenes that were cut out from the orginals.  Having these extra scenes makes for an overall better experience and in some cases (e.x. Lethal Weapon) a more insightful experience than the originals.  Lethal Weapon contains the most extra footage (which is around 7 minutes) and really adds a lot to the movie and a better understanding about Mel's character, Martin Riggs. The extra footage found on LW 2 and LW 3 is not as extensive but still adds something to each movie.  All of additional scenes fit in well with the original versions, so you know that they were all probably cut right before release and were not just thrown in there.  Each movie has been re-mastered and has a good overall crispness that the original ones didn't have.

The only thing holding me back from giving Legacy 5 stars is the lack of special features.  LW 2 contains a short behind the scenes stunt video, and theres the usual trailers and cast info, but other than that the special features of each movie is very bare bones.  Warner Bros. could have and should have done so much more with each DVD, as I know tons of bloopers, deleted scenes (different from these restored scenes), and interviews still exist from each of three Lethal Weapons.  How do I know this? Just watch the ""Pure Lethal"" documentary found on the special features side of Lethal Weapon 4.  This documentary is full of the extra stuff.  The Lethal Weapon 4 DVD was released before any of these directors cuts and that had a good amount of special features on it.  Warner should have kept in mind the way they did the LW 4 extras when putting together Legacy's extras.  But other than that complaint this is a great, reasonably priced package, for any Lethal Weapon fan.  If the special features were given more attention and if they made a LW 4 director's cut, then this would have been the perfect package.",1144713600,6,2385,4.710843373493976
1367397,5,B00004XMS2,"Good 3 movies and great for collectors, but not really an essential.",1059350400,,68,4.75
1367398,4,B00004XMS2,"As I'm sure many of you know, if you want to get the ultimate definitive editions (so far) of the first three `Lethal Weapon' flicks, this is the set to get! Included in each movie: at least a few extra minutes that director Richard Donner rescued from the cutting-room floor. Seven minutes are returned to LW1, featuring Murtaugh (Danny Glover) checking if he's still ""got it"" at the police firing range, Riggs bearing down on a schoolyard sniper, and a few other added bits. The highlight of LW2's new footage is Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) using his skills as a former mob accountant to recall the address of the stilt house. Not too much is added to number 3; probably the most noticeable of this is our heroes' use of a high-performance automobile to wring info out of a high-society gangsta.
Sadly, this set is somewhat devoid of special features. I was disappointed that Warner didn't use the `Lethal 4' DVD release (which included a half-hour restrospective and a feature-length commentary track) as the model to go off of for the LW Director's Cut DVDs. Aside from the obligatory trailers & restored scenes, there's not much else to these discs. Only LW2 has a featurette that goes behind-the-scenes during the nighttime helicopters-shooting-at-Riggs'-trailer scene.
Still, the sound & picture quality of these discs practically blow away (doh!) their VHS counterparts, which were pretty good themselves. Thanks to those extra background channels, you can really hear the reverb when our heroes start poppin' caps at the bad guys! I only wish Warner would finally get around to releasing their mo-pic DVDs in sturdy plastic keep cases, rather than those fairly flimsy & not-very-durable cardboard snap sleeves they seem to favor...

1367399,5,B00004XMS2,"After Mel Gibson made himself a household name with the Mad Max Trilogy,  he took a little time off, then returned to the screen in 1987 for the successful ""buddy-cop"" movie: Lethal Weapon.  You can't deny the chemistry between Gibson's Martin Riggs & Danny Glover's  Roger Murtaugh.  The relationship has the perfect blend of dramatic heart and humor, which is the key to the success of the film.  Initially, no sequel was planned (in fact the original filmed ending had both men saying goodbye forever), but director Richard Donner thought the characters were so good together, he just couldn't end the picture with them going their seperate ways.  As a result, Lethal Weapon 2 was released two years later, adding Joe Pesci to the mix of this winning formula as Leo Getz (""Whatever you want...Leo Getz""). With the huge success of the sequel, it was only a matter of time before Lethal Weapon 3 hit theaters in 1992, adding yet another new key character, Rene Russo's Lorna Cole, a sort of ""alter ego"" of the Martin Riggs character.  Since these movies are based on good chemistry between the characters, it's amazing to me how they're able to add new elements without deterring the original winning formula.  Blind luck?  Or Hollywood genius?  You be the judge.
Now you may be wondering about which Lethal Weapon DVD Box Set to pick up, since there are two of them available.  The first set has the first 3 films as well as Part 4 all together in a nice Black case.  The other has only Parts 1-3 in a shiny silver case.  Why get the shiny case box set?  This is the special ""Director's Cut"" Legacy edition, which includes added footage to the first 3 Lethal Weapon movies.  Lethal Weapon 1 has about 7 minutes of extra footage cut back into the film which adds some more insight into the Martin Riggs character.  (...)  The other films also have some added footage that are not as involving but still enjoyable to watch.  I have to point out to many out there, Director's Cuts can be any length, so that doesn't mean you're going to get 20 minutes of extra footage every time you buy one. You also get DTS sound with this set, which isn't available on the other one.  It's true that special features on the discs are pretty slim.  But I do urge you to pick up Lethal Weapon 4 separately (Part 4 has a whole side of a disc devoted to extra Features) and enjoy the Lethal Weapon movies in all their glory.",1007596800,65,2406,4.525462962962963
1367400,4,B00004XMS2,"First of all, the ""Director's Cut"" label is misleading. When I see ""Director's Cut"" on a disc, I expect 20 minutes or more of added footage.  However, these discs only have 13 minutes of extra footage COMBINED, with most of that getting added to the first film. So suffice to say, the added scenes add almost nothing to the films.
Secondly, these discs have very few special features, with only the standard trailers and bios included. Instead, the space on each disc is filled with both a Dolby Digital and DTS soundtrack. It should be no surprise that the DTS soundtracks are the best selling point of the set. (If you want special features about the Lethal Weapon series, you need to pick up Lethal Weapon 4.) Also, the packaging of these discs is much nicer than the original versions.
And this set pales in comparison to some of the more recent boxed sets, such as the Die Hard Ultimate Collection, and the upcoming Godfather Trilogy. Still, this set is currently the best presentation of the Lethal Weapon movies.  So if you enjoy the Lethal Weapon series, this set (complemented by the Lethal Weapon 4 disc) is your best bet.  It's just a shame Warner Bros didn't give these movies the treatment they deserve.",1000425600,8,1216,4.672897196261682
1367401,5,B00004XMS2,"What can I say?  The four Leathal Weapon movies are far beyone great!  The humor, the action... Damn these are good movies... then they had to go on and release these ""Director's Cut"" and they made a great set of movies a little better.  The scenes themselves don't add too much, but when taken in context to the rest of the series, they add imensly to the greater story of Riggs and Murtaugh... they amount to little snip-its that provide a better foundation for the characters than the original releases did.  If you're going to buy Leathal Weapon, make sure it's the Director's Cut!",982540800,11,585,4.596153846153846

7925966,4,B00004XMS2,"This Triple Pack contains the first three Lethal Weapon movies, in widescreen, and their director's cuts.  I prefer the first two movies over the third one, although I do get some enjoyment out of the third one.  Special features are kind of sparse, but what's included is still pretty decent.  The first two films are included on opposite sides of the first disc, while the third film gets its own disc.  The image quality may not be amazing, but it's still pretty good.  Audio is excellent as all three films have Dolby Digital Surround Sound or DTS 5.1 mix options.  The DTS, as always, sounds superb with clear, distinct channels and vibrant sound.",1462406400,,652,4.725663716814159
