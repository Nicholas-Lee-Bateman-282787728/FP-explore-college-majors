8007785,5,B00018D508,"Here's my Dame! To her credit, she allowed the CBC to include her ""mistake"" in one of the pieces she sang. She could have asked it to exclude that - she'd been La Stupenda for years - but...she chose not to. She knew her worth but, she remained unspoiled.",1453852800,,255,4.224489795918367
8007786,5,B00018D508,"This is a fabulous dvd! The first part - from 1963 when she was in her early prime - is a concert of arias. The singing is fantastic but the production values are cheesy to say the least. The second half, a recital with Richard Bonynge at the piano, is flawless. Here her voice, in 1969, is at its supreme best, her communication intimate and subtle. It's a varied program in several languages, none of them understandable because of her famously poor diction. Many of the songs are familiar from her several recital cds, but it is a treat to see her communicate them live. The second half is French songs and in these she is unparalleled. All in all this is a highly recommended dvd.",1302220800,,684,4.436507936507937
8007787,5,B00018D508,"Joan Sutherland at age 37; a wonderful experience.  It makes me wish I were old enough to have seen her live.  The DVD has two programs -- one from 1963 is in Black and White.  The one from 1969 is in color.  Both were broadcast on CBC television.  The quality is excellent.  The sound, though monophonic, is clear with a nice frequency range.  The visual elements of the 1963 program are a bit soft, but clear.  There is no blurring as I have seen from other broadcasts from that period.  The 1963 program is a bit choppy as if some elements were lost.  It took two viewings to understand what they were trying to do.  Regardless of these imperfections the two programs were wonderful.  To see and hear Ms Sutherland at this point in her career was a treat.",1298246400,,758,4.374100719424461
8007788,5,B00018D508,"This DVD consists of 2 recitals, each about an hour long.  I personally preferred the 1st one because the 2nd was sung to a piano accompaniment, and I always find this a letdown, preferring an orchestra.  Nonetheless, both were great.  These concerts were filmed in 1963 and 1969.  (Sutherland looked much the same in the 80s as she did in the 60s, her husband tended more to show his age, though he is a personable, ingratiating, completely professional man nonetheless, and I love him.)  Except the piano, I have only one quibble with the whole thing.  The first recital (once it gets off the ground) is narrated by Sutherland, and she gives thumbnail sketches of the great female opera singers dating from the mid-19th centrury.  Then in photograph-like frames, she sings an aria made famous by each of several of these women.  It was fascinating.  My gripe.  Two or 3 arias were sung before this history, this premise began, and there was applause as though they were live performances.  Once Sutherland began her narration, there was no applause.  This prelude was incongruous to the rest of the program.  That bothered me.  But the rest was glorious.  The 2nd recital was live to a packed hall, and there was not one cough or yawn that I noticed from beginning to end.  It was sublime (as popular American song lyricists of the 1st half of the 20th century have redefined that word, perfectly pleasant and agreeable).  This DVD is about $10 more expensive than the average opera on DVD from Amazon, but I recommend it anyway, even if you go hungry.  Sutherland was beautiful.  The 1st recital was fascinating, interesting.  The 2nd recital was sweet and perfect.  The 1st recital is arias from operas.  The 2nd one is songs, according to the man who introduced it, favorites of Sutherland.  Of course it is all a dream of bel canto, coloratura.",1093996800,17,1850,4.748427672955975
