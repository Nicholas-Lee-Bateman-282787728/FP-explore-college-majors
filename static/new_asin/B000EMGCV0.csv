2523466,5,B000EMGCV0,"This long overdue collection of the four films Bogie and Betty made together is an absolute must have for fans of both Forties flicks and of course the greatest romantic screen-team in Hollywood history. Starting with 'To Have and Have Not', which was Lauren Bacall's debut film, as has been said many times before one can literally watch the pair fall in love on-screen a la Garbo and Gilbert in 'Flesh and the Devil'. The story is pure Hemingway with wonderful support from Walter Brennan and Hoagy Carmichael among others.

Next came 'The Big Sleep', a wonderful (if not baffling!) film noir adapted from the popular novel by Raymond Chandler. Betty never looked more glamourous and sexy than she does in this one.

Their third film togather was the highly underrated 'Dark Passage', another noir gem expertly directed by the equally underrated Delmer Daves with superb support from Agnes Moorehead and Bruce Bennet. Bogie plays a framed innocent man just escaped from San Quentin who is aided and abetted by Bacall after winning her trust.

The fourth and unfortunately last film with the pair is 'Key Largo', more in the vein of 'To Have and Have Not' than the previous two. The best supporting cast of all four films includes Claire Trevor (who won Best Supporting Actress), Lionel Barrymore and Edward G. Robinson in one of his last tough-guy gangster roles. In her book, Bacall describes the experience of making this film as one of the happiest memories of her career with daily afternoon tea served in her dressing room!

The price of this set considering the high-quality of the prints and the marvellous and relevant extras included by Warner's makes this set excellent value for money. Don't think twice, get it!",1144281600,33,1725,4.897260273972603

2523513,5,B000EMGCV0,"Four ways to say I love you. All classic movie buffs will have to have this collection. Perfect black and white make you wish color never came out. I started out watching ""To Have and Have Not"" with my dad about fifty years ago and have grown to love it more as the years go by for not only the brilliant acting but the way the music of Hoagy Carmichael is woven into the storyline. World War II is the coming spectre that looms large in the whole movie and shadows both the plot and the mood of the film, the fear of not getting out that became normal for world travelers at that time. The other three movies are also wonderful. ""Key Largo"" was always considered an Edward G. Robinson top performance and features a stellar cast and solid gold from Lionel Barrymore and Bogey as the anti-hero.""Dark Passage"" is film noir at it's best and a real treat for San Francisco residents who still remember it in the early fifties, clean and uncrowded. This is interesting not only for the great plot but as well for the direction itself, like the twist of not seeing the beginning of the movie from the viewers perspective. Unique and very good performance from H.B. The fourth movie here is ""The Big Sleep"", classic Phillip Marlowe as the dogged gumshoe, ever relentless in his pursuit of the bad guys. Some great, great movie lines in this one. It was only topped by "" The Maltese Falcon"" in terms of being a ""perfect"" detective story. These two players worked well together.",1434240000,4,1470,4.4888059701492535

2523518,1,B000EMGCV0,"I purchased this collection in August 2008. I already have some of the titles on VHS, which we don't use anymore. Great movies and wanted them on DVD. At last unpacked them and discovered that only one (Dark Passage) is playable from start to finish. The others have manufacturing faults.

2523532,5,B000EMGCV0,"Of the three Bogart signature collection packages, this one is the best, in terms of the price (almost half of buying them individually) and the quality of the pictures (Key Largo, The Big Sleep and To Have And Have Not are great classics that have past the test of time with flying colors). Dark Passage is the weakest of the movies, but it's not bad, and the dvd have some great extras, including the Bugs Bunny short Slick Hare, with Bogart (a Bogart and Bacall cartoon) in it.
Key Largo alone is one of the best bogart movies of all time (even if The Big Sleep and To Have And Have Not are better regarded). The three films are great classics.",1421280000,,647,4.355371900826446

2523601,4,B000EMGCV0,"Very well packaged with nice box to hold 4 DVD. Easy viewing but could have contained more 'special features' i.e. interviews and history of making the movie. Vocal dialogue clear and crisp as are the pictures. Great for personal in home collection, and the 4 DVD case adds a nice elegant touch. Should hold up well with routine handling. Certainly worth the money. 'To Have and Have Not' is very loosely based on Hemingway's book, but, is still enjoyable. Jules Furthman and William Faulkner adapted Hemingway's classic book, and, take numerous liberties with the Heminway's storyline. So beware if looking for the movie to follow Hemingway's book as one will be dissapointed (if in high school and looking to shortcut by watching the movie rather than reading the book...you are busted.) Howard Hawks is at his best as a director with 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep.'
  John Huston directs 'Key Largo' which is included in the collection. Delmar Daves directs 'Dark Passage.'
  Hoagy Carmichael plays-performs a few songs in 'To Have and Have Not' but they are not overdone and fit the storyline well. The scene with Bacall asking for a 'light' and 'just blow' is subtle and redhot with classic sex appeal. Dolores Moran exudes classic beauty and fine acting skills, while Bacall with a cool calm demeanor matches Moran's physical beauty with body language and dialogue. There are moments of levity which are appropriate and low key. The jacket liner notes ""it strongly resembles Casablanca"" which is a stretch and, strongly resembles a marketing ploy. Overall this is a fine Bogie & Bacall movie and well worth owning and viewing many times.",1343865600,3,1655,4.942446043165468
2523602,5,B000EMGCV0,"I know I will get skewered for this review, and some will consider my opinions to be blasphemous, but I believe this set has three of four movies that outclass what is supposed to be the greatest, if not one of the greatest movies of all time. Casablanca is great in its own right, but three of these movies, Key Largo, To Have and Have Not, and Dark Passage have a dialogue between its two main characters, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, that quite frankly outshines the dialogue Bogie had with Ingrid Bergman. I believe that Bogart and Bacall simply are on a level that has not been attained since. If you want to learn what meaningful dialogue sounds like, just watch these movies. The chemistry between Bogie and Bacall is as close to perfection as the silver screen will ever know. In Lauren Bacall's first movie with Bogie, the electricity crackles the moment their eyes meet in ""To Have and Have Not"". Bogie (Harry Morgan) is a charter fisherman who gets involved in the activities of the Free French in World War II on the island of Martinique. He manages to land one of their leaders in Martinique, and almost single-handedly takes on the nefarious Vichy leaders and their Gestapo henchmen. The dialogue is memorable between Bogie and Bacall (Marie ""Slim"" Browning), but the dialogue between Bogie and his mate Eddie (Walter Brennan), who is always looking out for him despite the fact that he is an alcoholic, rates highly as well and is quite hilarious.
In ""Key Largo"", friendship as well as a heavy dose of hostility, compliments of Nora Temple (Bacall), finds Bogie (Major Frank McCloud) in a nest of blood-thirsty gangsters who commandeer Mr. Temple's (Lionel Barrymore) hotel in Key Largo. Some memorable exchanges occur not only with Bacall, but also with Edward G. Robinson (Johnny Rocco). With some guts and resourcefulness, Bogie gains the upper hand on Rocco's band of thugs, and returns to Bacall.
In what is, in my opinion, Bogie's best movie ever, ""Dark Passage"", he plays an escaped convict, Vincent Parry, who escapes San Quentin Prison with the hope of clearing his name of the murder of his wife. What makes this movie unique is for roughly the first half of the film, the audience sees through Parry's eyes, first as an escaped convict and later as he recovers from plastic surgery to his face. Once again, some very memorable dialogue with his rescuer Irene Jansen (Bacall), but also with Sam the Taxi Driver (Tom D'Andrea), and his arch nemesis, the forever scheming Madge Rapf (Agnes Moorehead). In addition to the fine dialogue, this movie is filmed in San Francisco, with some excellent venues, especially the Golden Gate Bridge, the area around Telegraph Hill and the Filbert Steps, and the Powell-Mason Cable Car line.
The fourth movie of the group, ""The Big Sleep"",while not being one of my favorite movies, is nevertheless another good movie with Bogie and Bacall. Film for film, this might be the best film set Amazon sells. If you like Bogie and Bacall, this set is a ""must have"".",1342310400,2,3023,4.8042226487524

2523613,4,B000EMGCV0,"Humphrey Bogart was one of the iconic film stars of the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in numerous classic films, most notably ""Casablanca"".  But while his pairing with Ingrid Bergman in that film has gone down as one of film's greatest love stories, Bogart's most famous pairing on screen was not with Bergman, but with his fourth and final wife, Lauren Bacall.  He met and fell in love with Bacall on the set of their first film, and three further ones would follow, all of which are collected here on DVD.  The films all have varying degrees of noir influence, but also show the clear imprint of studio attempts to replicate the success of ""Casablanca""; through it all, the interactions between Bogart and Bacall are a highlight.  Plot details for each film are discussed hence.

""To Have and Have Not"", released in 1944, is the first of two films on the set directed by Howard Hawks.  It is based, in the loosest sense of the term, on a novel by Ernest Hemingway, adapted by William Faulkner and Jules Furthman (it thus represents the only 'collaboration' by the two Nobel Prize-winning American authors who were the opposite poles of American fiction in the middle of the 20th century) - which mostly amounted to Faulkner and Furthman throwing out most of Hemingway's novel and turning it into a ripoff of ""Casablanca"".  Captain Harry Morgan (Bogart) finds himself under pressure to help the Free French infiltrate the island of Martinique, then controlled by the Vichy French government; Morgan doesn't want to take a side, but he finds himself drawn into the conflict, partly because of his involvement with Marie (Bacall), a fellow American.  The main attraction here is Bogart and Bacall's interactions; indeed, Hawks was sufficiently impressed by their chemistry that he had the film rewritten to emphasize the two, relegating Dolores Moran's Helene, who was meant to be Bogart's primary love interest originally, to a minor part.

""The Big Sleep"", filmed around the same time but released in 1946 due to scheduling and production issues, comes from the same creative team (Hawks, Faulkner, Furthman, and new writer Leigh Brackett), and this time puts Bogart and Bacall centre-stage from the start; they were already married by the time production had ceased, and would remain so until his death in 1957, having two children in the interim.  ""The Big Sleep"" is based on the seminal detective novel by Raymond Chandler, and constitutes Bogart's second major contribution to film noir after playing Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade in ""The Maltese Falcon"".  Bogart is Philip Marlowe, Chandler's celebrated protagonist, drawn into a mystery involving the Sternwood family, whose younger daughter is being blackmailed.  Bacall is the older daughter, who, of course, sparks with Marlowe.  The film has an infamously complicated plot (including one murder never explained; legend has it that Chandler himself, when asked, didn't know), but holds together very well, with superb atmosphere (a must for a Chandler adaptation); it's a bona fide classic of the noir genre.

""Dark Passage"", released in 1947, is the black sheep of this collection.  While the others are made by legendary directors and often based on the works of famous novelists, this film was overseen by Delmer Daves, a journeyman studio writer and director.  However, I would rate it the second-best film in the collection, and it provides some of the best interaction between Bogart and Bacall.  Bogart's character is Vincent Parry, who has escaped from prison, where he had been sent after being wrongly convicted of the murder of his wife; aided by Bacall's Irene, he gets plastic surgery (for the first hour, the film is shot from Vincent's POV, so we never see his face before the surgery makes him look like Bogart; this is an unconventional approach), and must attempt to both keep his identity secret and try to find the true killer of his wife.  The plot is a bit contrived in places (particularly the setup for him getting the surgery), but it is a very well-done film.

""Key Largo"", released in 1948, is the final film of the collection, written and directed by John Huston, who had also handled Bogart's breakthrough roles in ""High Sierra"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"", and would in the same year direct him in ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"" (incidentally, arguably his best role).  ""Key Largo"" is the one film in the collection I think is somewhat overrated.  Our story follows Bogart to a hotel in Key Largo, to visit the father (Lionel Barrymore, tremendously fun) and widow (Bacall) of a dead war comrade, only to find that the hotel has been occupied by the entourage of an exiled mobster (Edward G. Robinson).  Bogart's non-detective characters frequently had a lot of Rick Blaine in them (as the first film in this collection did), but this film's lead is rather unconvincing as a shirker.  However, others rate this much more highly than I do, and it is not unentertaining.

All in all, a good collection of a great screen couple (though these films do not, apart from ""The Big Sleep"", really represent Bogart's best work).  Surprisingly, despite Bogart having nearly a decade of film stardom remaining after 1948 before he died, he and Bacall never worked together again.",1313193600,3,5250,4.972571428571428
2523614,5,B000EMGCV0,"This is a terrific set of movies with Bogie and Bacall.  My favorite is probably ""To Have and Have Not"" with not only sultry Bacall and her famous 'you know how to whistle, don't you Steve?"" line, but Walter Brennan at his very best as the sidekick comedy relief.  Dark Passage is great as Bogie plays the ex-con with a new face.  ""The Big Sleep"" is one of the best for the witty banter that only these two could convey.  The extras are really enjoyable, especailly the cartoons that showcase Bogie and Bacall. I got this set as a gift for my husband and we have both thoroughly enjoyed every movie in the collection.  It makes you long for the days when really fantastic films were made.",1306886400,,688,4.3858267716535435
2523615,5,B000EMGCV0,"This set includes all four of the films that Bogart and Bacall made together.  All four films are excellent and it is hard to pick a favorite.  I must admit, however, that The Big Sleep is my favorite simply because I love whodunits.  But, the 19 year old Bacall is amazing and sensual in To Have and Have Not.  Key Largo is also excellent with Edward G. Robinson as the heavy and Bogart as the brave veteran protecting his love interest (Bacall) during a hurricane.  Dark Passage features Bogart as a prison escapee who has a new face thanks to underground plastic surgery.  Lauren Bacall is the beautiful woman who believes his innocence.  Agnes Moorehead is outstanding as the murderess who framed Bogart. Like I said it is almost impossible to pick a favorite because they all all excellent films.  If you love Film Noir as much as I do, this set is a must have for your collection.  The price is right and I can whole heartedly recommend this collection.  You can't go wrong.",1304380800,2,980,4.548571428571429
2523616,4,B000EMGCV0,"Detailed descriptions of each of the films in this excellent selection are found elsewhere. I found all films to be very good in their digital remastered presentations. The details throughout the frames are great. There's not much in the way of ""extras,"" but that's not an issue for me. With all the purported ""sizzle"" between B & B, I thought the movie with the least romance (Key Largo, directed by John Huston) was the most enjoyable. Here, Max Steiner's music also helps create a very touching mood to reflect on life's meanings. Also, I just love EG Robinson's wacko Rocco character. Dark Passage is also interesting in its first-person camerawork, even though the story is a bit disjointed. Overall, except for Key Largo, I was hoping for more ""conclusive"" endings -- they seemed to end too quickly, especially since you easily become involved with the characters. Nonetheless, if you like movies, this bit of cinema history is thoroughly enjoyable.",1294185600,,955,5.012578616352202

2523619,5,B000EMGCV0,"I really don't understand why people have a hard time following ""The Big Sleep"". To me it is fairly simple and quite wonderful. I also adore ""To have and have not."" It goes down in my top 10 favorite classic movies. The chemistry between Bogey and Bacall practically jumps off the screen at you. ""Key Largo"" is also fantastic. The dark mood of the film is felt from the first 10 seconds. I hope everyone gives these movies a chance!

2523648,4,B000EMGCV0,"""Bogie and Bacall -- The Signature Collection,"" brings us the four movies the near-legendary Hollywood stars, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, made together, from first, Howard Hawks's 1944 ""To Have and Have Not,"" in which the couple, just meeting, literally fall in love on screen, through probably their best together, 1946's ""The Big Sleep,"" again directed by Hawks; their strangest, 1947's ""Dark Passage,"" written and directed by Delmar Daves; and their last, the 1948 ""Key Largo,"" directed by John Huston.

All four films are made by Warner Brothers, in black and white; all but ""Dark Passage"" made entirely on studio back lots, despite the ostensible tropical settings of ""To Have and Have Not,"" and ""Key Largo.""  In most, Bogie plays a character that will be familiar to his fans from his previous work, particularly the great wartime hit ""Casablanca"" that directly preceded ""To Have.""  We see some of the familiar Warner Brothers company of supporting players in these films, and some well-known, highly-esteemed actors, but the pictures belong to Bogie and Bacall, as they fire up the screen, as lovers and then newly-marrieds.

""To Have and Have Not,"" supposedly resulted from a bet between Hawks and Ernest Hemingway, famed American author of the book on which it's based.  Hawks said he could get a good movie from Hemingway's worst book, which this was.  Hawks did so, with a screenplay by another famed American novelist, William Faulkner, and Jules Furthman.  The picture, however, is an effort to remake ""Casablanca,"" without Ingrid Bergman, or the earlier movie's sterling supporting cast.  Set on a French-speaking Caribbean island, with Vichy French and Free French at war.  Almost-heroic Free French fighter, and his wife.  Bogie as Henry (Steve) Morgan, hardboiled antihero who sticks his neck out for nobody.  Hugely talented American singer-songwriter Hoagy Carmichael as Cricket, singing piano player.  Despite his many beautiful compositions, he just doesn't hold the screen as did Dooley Wilson, playing Sam, singer of ""As Time Goes By,"" in the earlier film.  Walter Brennan thrown in playing his stellar drunk, Eddie, asking people ""Was you ever stung by a dead bee?""  He's treated with romanticizing kid gloves by all concerned.  And the breathtaking 19-year old Bacall, as Marie (Slim) Browning, who's just landed on the island because she's run out of money.  She's given a snazzy check suit, and some snappy dialogue.  Remember ""You know how to whistle, don't you?""  She even sings; legend says she was dubbed by Andy Williams, but that's not necessarily true.  They say her part was beefed up when the studio execs saw what was happening onscreen.  Sid Hickox's noirish cinematography also contributes greatly to a sexy, old-fashioned, rather routinely plotted, World War II thriller, combining romance, faraway adventure, and a macho Hemingway hero.

""The Big Sleep,"" 1944, was the second film made by the golden trio, Bogart, Bacall and Hawks.  The screenplay, again, was by novelist Faukner, based, this time, on a detective novel of the same name by the Californian author Raymond Chandler.  This noir mystery thriller also casts a backwards eye at ""Casablanca.""  Here, Bogie plays Philip Marlowe, Chandler's existential, street-smart, courageous private eye, called to investigate efforts to blackmail the aging, incapacitated, wealthy General Sternwood about one of his daughters.  Both the General's daughters, the old man admits, are wild, and have the vices of their class, but Carmen, played by Martha Vickers, is most troublesome; Vivian, played by Bacall, gambles, and seems, carelessly enough, to have recently misplaced her husband, of whom the General was fond.  Still, in this picture, Vivian has great rooms and clothes, and a nifty white coupe convertible.  Supporting players include Dorothy Malone, Peggy Knudsen, Bob Steele, Lash Canino, and Elisha Cook.  Max Steiner contributed the atmospheric score.  The notoriously complicated, difficult to follow plot is frequently interrupted by girls admiring Bogie, and stopped dead so Bacall can sing.  The screenplay cleans up its source material considerably, still, it was considered an unusually violent and amoral movie for its time.  Treatment of Los Angeles is moody; night scenes are shadow and fog, daylight scenes slightly, menacingly overblown.  Nobody played harried and world-weary better than Bogart.

1947's ""Dark Passage,"" noir thriller, was written and directed by Delmar Daves, based on a novel by David Goodis, who wrote the novel on which ""Shoot The Piano Player"" is based.  It's set in San Francisco of the 40's, and may be the best screen treatment of that city at that time.  Once again, Sidney Hickox's noirish cinematography takes full advantage of its flavorful setting, hills, bay, staircase streets.  The building in which Bacall's character, Irene Jansen, supposedly lives, and its glass elevator, and her duplex apartment, are masterpieces of the ""moderne"" style then highly popular.  Bogart plays Vincent Parry, a doctor unjustly convicted of killing his wife; at the film's opening, he's just escaped from San Quentin, coming home to clear himself.  For the first hour, we never see him, only see everything through his eyes, then a new filmic technique.  The gimmick is, he has plastic surgery so as to no longer be recognizable; he then becomes the Bogart we know.  Housely Stevenson plays the plastic surgeon Dr. Walter Coley: his scenes are treated in a most Frankensteinian way.  The plot takes some truly odd turns: we're to believe that Agnes Moorhead, who is surely riveting, could give Bacall a run for her money in the Bogart stakes.  As if. Bacall doesn't sing, but she looks sensational, and has, in addition to that apartment, some stylish clothes and jewelry -- note the Mexican opals.  She's also got an eye-catching, memorable ""woody"" station wagon.

""Key Largo,"" 1948, directed by John Huston, was the last screen pairing of our two leads.  It's based on a stage play by Maxwell Anderson, nominally set in the tropical Florida Keys.  A wheelchair-bound Lionel Barrymore plays James Temple, owner of the island hotel; Bacall plays Nora, his widowed daughter in law.  Bogart plays Frank Mc Cloud, who fought the Italian campaign alongside the Temple boy until he was killed.  Mc Cloud goes to visit the Temples off-season, and discovers that a powerful hurricane's coming.  And that they are being terrorized by Edward G. Robinson, one of the great movie villains, playing gangster Johnny Rocco. Clair Trevor, playing Gaye Downs, Rocco's moll, former nightclub entertainer, gets to sing this time.  She does an acapella ""Moanin' Low,""  a song popularized by Libby Holman in the early 30's, and won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for it.  Bogart plays an unusually quiet version of his ""I stick my neck out for nobody character.""  But, such are the burdens of marriage, Bacall is uncharacteristically demure.  She doesn't appear to be wearing makeup, her eyes are downcast, and her wardrobe seems to consist of one --dowdy-- outfit.  She doesn't have those lines, either: Barrymore and Robinson get them this time.

These four films are the components of this collection.  There will be no more by our two great leads, and they were certainly among the screen's most incendiary lovers.  If you want them, this is it.",1181865600,85,7362,5.217021276595744
2523649,5,B000EMGCV0,"As a writer, I find it interesting to study classic movies that gripped our imaginations, found - and sometimes lost - romance, and always produced suspense.

Settle in and remind yourself of how relationships are supposed to work!

They are also good if you just want to be entertained. The movies are better together, because you can just keep going from one to the next and chances are, you will.

2523653,5,B000EMGCV0,"The 1940s Hollywood power couple of Humphrey Bogart (1899-1957) and Lauren Bacall (1924-) made four excellent films together:
(1) To have and have not (1944)--11/03 snap-case DVD UPC 012569584327, 7/06 keep-case DVD UPC 012569676862
(2) The big sleep (1946)--2/00 snap-case DVD UPC 012569502628, 7/06 keep-case DVD UPC 012569676817

(4) Key Largo (1948)--2/00 snap-case DVD UPC 012569501027, 7/06 keep-case DVD UPC 012569676848
The 1944 movie is a World-War-II film whereas the others are film-noir flicks. [Incidentally, Bacall played opposite Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe in How to marry a millionaire (1953). The film has an in-joke: the Bacall character says: ""I've always liked older men. Look at Roosevelt, look at Churchill, look at that old fella what's his name in The African Queen. Absolutely crazy about him."" Bacall is referring to her real-life husband, Humphrey Bogart.]

The box set ""Bogie & Bacall: The signature collection"" (DVD 7/06) collects the four Bogart-Bacall movies in a convenient slip case to house appropriately four plastic keep cases but awkwardly four cardboard snap cases. The four films in the box set come in plastic keep cases and are
also available separately. The previous releases were in cardboard snap cases but are still available. The exteriors of the respective snap and keep cases are virtually identical, those of The big sleep DVD varying the most, but only for the ""special features"" note. The earlier snap cases each have inside a chapter index and additional photo. The newer keep cases lack scene indices. I compared the four DVDs in the snap-case editions with the four DVDs in the keep-case editions. The DVDs for each movie are identical. It is important to note that the DVD for The big sleep is two-sided:
  Side A (114 min) = 1946 theatrical-release version
  Side B (116 min) = 1944 pre-release version with 18 minutes that were either reshot or deleted from the theatrical release
Side B of the keep-case DVD is not clearly labeled as such.

Warner was remiss in not issuing with the box set a brief booklet on Bogart and Bacall.

In conclusion, if you have the four snap-case editions, they are not outdated, and with reasonable care the cardboard snap cases wear well. However, if you are a Bogart collector lusting for the nice slip case for the quartet of films, get the box set with the plastic keep-case editions and give your snap-case editions to a friend or relative.",1164844800,73,2536,5.096385542168675

Go to Wal-Mart or Best Buy where they most likely have the the same items except with the nice cases for the same price.  The movies however are great.,1156118400,18,553,4.247619047619048

2523656,5,B000EMGCV0,"This DVD set of films featuring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall is sheer heaven for classic film fans. Each film is fabulous by itself, and watched together over a short period of time will really give any film lover a sense of why so many people love Bogie and Bacall. It is also an excellent example of two great directors in their prime. Howard Hawks, who has never fully received the credit he deserves for the many film masterpieces for which he was responsible, helmed two of these films, and John Huston directed another. This DVD set includes both the first and last of the couple's films together.

While ""Dark Passage"" is perhaps a level below the other three, there is a terrific ending which makes up for some slow spots. Having it included here makes the cycle of films the two made together complete. Lesser Bogie and Bacall is still better than most anything else out there. ""Dark Passage"" is a good film for fans as entertainment, but the other three are true film classics.

First, we have Hawks' ""The Big Sleep."" It is one of the most unique adaptations of a detective novel ever brought to the screen. Watching this film is one of the true joys of being a film buff. This is extraordinary entertainment that grabs your attention quickly and keeps it until the final shot. It is exciting and engaging, and a favorite of all detective film fans.

Director Howard Hawks turned Raymond Chandler's most popular story into an absolutely mesmerizing celluloid masterpiece. Raymond Chandler's complex novel was adapted for the screen by William Faulkner. We may never know for sure who committed one of the murders in this blurry crime noir, but like all Hawks' films, it is so incredibly entertaining we really don't care. It is full of sharp dialog and dreamy images much like the aftereffects of a drinking binge.

The story itself moves at a terrific clip, and there is so much going on you might get lost if you blink. Humphry Bogart is Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, and from the moment he arrives to talk to General Sternwood and gets mixed up with his daughters this is a film classic. One would think with a young and sultry Bacall getting tangled up with Bogart in their first film together, they would be everything in this film; they are not, however, as Martha Vickers gives a performance that has you thinking about her in every scene, even when she isn't present. She steals every scene she is in and is one of the most memorable dolls in noir history.

Bacall portrays the General's sultry older daughter, Vivian, but it is the sexy and thumb sucking younger daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers) whom Marlowe meets first. She leaves an immediate impression on both the viewer and Marlowe: as he tells the General: ""Yeah, we met. She tried to sit in my lap and I was standing up."" The very sick Sternwood wants Marlowe to look into a little matter involving blackmail and his daughters.

As Marlowe follows the trail of gambling debts, he finds one body after another and tries to extricate the daughters from the mess. Marlowe and Vivian have a spark that gives him incentive to get the job done, but he may not be able to head off the rollercoaster headed for the little kitten Carmen, who may turn out to have some very large claws. Dorothy Malone has a brief but sexy role as a clerk who shares more than a drink with Marlowe.

Hawks filmed this as moody dream of dialog and images hard to forget. Bogart's Marlowe has his hands full trying to keep Carmen out of trouble. The sparks that begin to fly between he and Carmen's big sister, Vivian, is complicated by her involvement with some of the players for the other team. Trying to find a way to keep the fast rising body count from getting any higher, while keeping Vivian and her little sister Carmen in the clear, will take some dangerous turns for Marlowe.

Bacall has never been more beautiful or inviting than when she is slumped down in the seat of Bogart's car, just waiting for him to kiss her. You have to see this film to really appreciate it. No description could ever do it justice. You'll never see anything else like it in American cinema. A true noir classic, and one of Howard Hawks' masterpieces. A must see film for noir fans.

The same could be said of the second film in this collection directed by Howard Hawks, ""To Have and Have Not."" The summer of 1940 in Martinique as people began to choose sides is the setting for another Howard Hawks masterpiece. William Faulkner, who had adapted Raymond Chandler's complex novel for the director's other Bogart screen classic, ""The Big Sleep,"" expanded a thin Hemingway story with writing partner Jules Furthman into another. This is sort of ""Casablanca"" with grit rather than gloss, and is just as enjoyable. ""To Have and Have Not"" does, in fact, outshine that film with its upbeat ending, and marks the real contrast between the two films, despite their similarities.

Bogart is Harry Morgan, trying to stay neutral about the local politics while he and his pal Eddie (Walter Brennan) take tourists ocean fishing in the waters of Martinique. His pal Frenchy (Marcel Dalio) wants him to use his boat to pick up a couple that will put him square in the middle of all that's going on both in Martinique and the rest of the world as the Germans make their move across the globe.

Morgan is fending off getting involved just fine until his latest fishing customer gets knocked off by accident before he can pay up. Complicating things further for Morgan is a newcomer named Marie Browning (Lauren Bacall) who sort of attaches herself to him from the moment they meet. She has come from Brazil by way of Trinidad and ends up in Martinique only because she doesn't have money to go any further. They seem a perfect fit despite all the sparring between them; a point driven home by her response to Eddie's question about bees. The viewer knows at that moment that she and Harry are a match made in Hollywood heaven.

Brennan is just terrific as Harry's old pal in constant need of a drink to keep the shakes at bay. He thinks he's looking after Harry when in fact it's Harry who's looking after him. The trademark male world of Howard Hawks is much in evidence here, as Bogart's autonomy begins to crack only when he finds his match in Bacall. Like many of Hawks' characters, Morgan lives by his own code and his own rules, and only breaks them out of loyalty to someone else. Another Hawks trademark of the sizing up of people from the inside out is also much in evidence here. Bogart and Bacall never even speak the other's name in this film: she calls him ""Steve"" and he refers to her as ""Slim"" throughout the entire film.

When Harry finally agrees to pick up Frenchy's pals in the Resistance to earn enough money to get Slim home, he gets more than he bargained for in more ways than one. It convinces Slim to stay on because she now knows for sure that ""Steve"" is the right guy. She gets a job singing for the piano player at the Hotel Martinique, Cricket (Hoagy Charmichael). And after a patrol boat takes a potshot at one of his passengers, his very beautiful wife begins to warm up to Harry in a big hurry, causing a bit of jealousy on Slim's part. Doloros Moran is very nice and quite pretty as that wife, Hellene de Bursac.

There are a ton of great exchanges between Bacall and Bogart here, the most famous being the ""just whistle"" scene. There are many others equally as good, however, including an exchange about strings that has Bacall walking around Bogart, and a great line from Bacall about walking home if it weren't for all that water. It is this latter exchange, and one other about Slim's lack of a reaction when being slapped that Hawks uses to highlight the personal baggage both Harry and Marie are bringing to the table.

A young Bacall looks gorgeous in gowns by Milo Anderson, and Sid Hickox's photography gives the film a real feel of a tiny island with palm trees lining the streets. Bogart's Harry will eventually engage in the fight when he decides he likes the people on one side and doesn't like the people on the other side. It is very much both a Hawks and Bogart type moment, the personal moral code of the anti-hero coming fully into play.

This is a fun film with great characters, lots of atmosphere, and an ending the polar opposite of ""Casablanca."" The song ""How Little We Know"" from Hoagy Charmichael and Johnny Mercer never amounted to much compared to the more famous ""As Time Goes By"" from ""Casablanca,"" but works nicely with the mood Hawks created for his second film with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. If you're looking for a big dose of Bogie and Bacall, and want the kind of ending ""Casablanca"" didn't have, then ""To Have and Have Not"" is a sure bet to please you. A fine film and a true screen classic.

Last but by no means least is the somber, ""Key Largo."" John Huston crafted this very fine film with the underlying theme of isolation from a play by Maxwell Anderson. The backdrop of a gangster taking over a hotel in the Florida Keys is filled with inner emotional depth rather than a lot of action, making this the most mature and realistic of romances Bogart and Bacall would have on screen.

Major Frank McCloud (Bogart) shows up at the Largo hotel in the Keys to see his war buddy's father and widow to give them some news about how George died a hero. McCloud himself is disillusioned from trying to save the world and has been drifting since the war in both a personal and literal sense.

Nora (Bacall) had been drifting before she met George and begins to feel this same connection to Frank as they talk about their lives since the war. There is a maturity here as Huston shows a deeper aspect to caring about someone instead of the fireworks of physical attraction. The themes of loneliness and isolation run through every aspect of this film.

Frank once again must decide whether to save the world when the Largo is taken over by fallen gangster Johnny Rocco (Robinson). Rocco was once big and despite his deportation back to Cuba by the United States government as an undesirable, plans to be big again. Frank had gone to war as an idealist, hoping to rid the world of gangsters like Rocco but now views it as a lost cause.

But as Nora keeps telling Frank, your head may say one thing but your whole life says another. As the tension of being held hostage as a hurricane approaches the sweltering Keys builds, Frank slowly begins to go with his whole life rather than his head, breaking his own personal isolation from the fight he gave up. The turning point comes when Rocco humiliates his former girlfriend Gay Dawn by making her sing for a drink and then refuses to give her one when she comes across.

Claire Trevor gives a great performance as a girl much like Nora who got hooked up with the wrong guy and became a lush. She will have her own turning point when she slips Frank a gun before he takes Rocco and his pals back to Cuba. Lionel Barrymore gives a good performance also as George's disabled father, holding on to his son's memory and his beliefs.

A great score by Max Steiner complements the lonely mood of this film perfectly. Bacall is terrific as she waits for Frank to return against the odds, so she can open up the shutters of her loneliness and let the light in once more. This is a somber and mature film that deserves to be viewed more than once. Bogart and Bacall fans will love this film but find more here than just Bogie and Bacall. A minor masterpiece and one you need to own.

Three of these are are among the finest ever made, and the fourth is as good or better than many films made during the same time period. This set of films is for romantics, and no one is more romantic than noir lovers. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall are the image of a noir couple in the minds of many moviegoers, and fans will find a lot to love here with this magnificent collection.",1145232000,45,11911,4.534450651769087

as engrossing, Dark Passage & Key Largo are still worth
a watch. These all have, of course, Humphrey Bogart &
Lauren Bacall, with several really good supporting actors.
I personally got the whole set just for The Big Sleep, which
has Bogie as Philip Marlowe. A great movie! RP",1524268800,,389,4.416666666666667
