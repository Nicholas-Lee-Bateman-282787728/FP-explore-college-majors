8066127,4,B0009SCV14,"My Spanish is very limited but I was able to follow most of the film which has no subtitles in Spanish or English.  It's interesting to see the story of Hamlet reset in Colonial Mexico.  Knowing that story, even when the dialogue was too complicated for me,  I had no trouble following this movie. Interesting to see how the variations were worked into the original story; also interesting to notice that Shakespeare didn't get a mention in the credits for story or script!",1297468800,,473,4.674698795180723
