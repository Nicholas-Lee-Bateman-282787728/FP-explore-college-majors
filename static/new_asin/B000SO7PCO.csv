2888362,5,B000SO7PCO,"I ordered this video for my grandson. He loves watching ""Everybody hates Chris.  The packaging looked fine.  He told me that he watched the tape, so I am assuming everything was fine.",1265587200,,183,4.6875
2888363,5,B000SO7PCO,"I loveeee this show and so sad that another black show was let off the air. but its good to own for your home, i love the family dynamic of the show and the comedic side of it is hilarious as well as seeing a normal black family living life in the 80's in Bed-stuy BROOKLYN!!! :)

Get this dvd it is WORTH every penny!!!",1264896000,,320,3.923076923076923
2888364,5,B000SO7PCO,"I love this series. It's especially fun to watch it with my son and teach him about Black social issues and history through it. He's laughing and enjoying the storyline and not realizing how much he's learning! The creative staff on this series have done a fabulous job keeping the story archs interesting and the characters exaggerated but fun. This comedy is not politically correct, yet it's not offensive. Kudos to the show for walking that line well.",1229990400,3,455,4.846153846153846
2888365,5,B000SO7PCO,"I have a three year old daughter.  Ever since she could tell what was on t.v.  she has just adored Chris.  Everybody hates Chris is her favorite show (so far).  I tivo it every week and have bought both seasons of the show.  Not only does it keep my daughter busy, she also knows all of the charcters by name, she even knows some of the phrases, like ""let me hold a dollar""! I thought that that was so funny!!!",1202169600,4,410,4.075
2888366,4,B000SO7PCO,"This 2nd season is not as hilarious as the 1st, but it still has it's moments, the show has also grown with recurring roles from Whoopi Goldberg, Jackee Harry, Todd bridges, Ernest(Raj)Thomas, Loretta Devine,  Antonio Fargas and more. Not that much editing has been done, even some of the original music has been left in. Some standout episodes are ""Everybody hates Thanksgiving"" ""Everybody hates skipping school"", ""Everybody hates DJs"" In overall, this is still some of the best writing a sitcom has seen in quite some time, if you enjoyed the 1st season, you'll enjoy the 2nd seaon as well.",1194825600,7,592,4.92
2888367,4,B000SO7PCO,"I love Chris Rock - his HBO appearances are classic.  However, ""Everyone Likes Chris"" is more than a little watered down from the expectations set by Rock's other appearances.  On the other hand, I should also note that his stories about growing up in Brooklyn and dealing with bullies, negative influences, well-intentioned and decent parents, somewhat manipulative siblings, and the usual issues at school are wholesome, lack any serious racial bent, and are at least mildly amusing.",1194134400,2,485,5.285714285714286
2888368,3,B000SO7PCO,"I just purchased season 2 of ""Everybody Hates Chris"", and immediately upon returning home from the store, noticed these dreaded words on the back of the box..""SOME EPISODES MAY BE EDITED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL NETWORK VERSIONS."" Not having seen these episodes during their network run, I have no way of knowing what, if any, scenes have been edited? And before I dare open the set, i'm hoping someone who did see them on TV before the DVD release can give a proper review and list any and all changes that were made? If there have been scenes edited out, i'd like to ask CBS DVD one question? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?????????????? It's bad enough that old time favorites like Happy Days and WKRP In Cincinnati, etc, are being released to DVD in severely edited versions because of corporate laziness and the greedy practices of the music industry? (hmmmm too bad we can't sue them the way they're suing us these days lol) But why in the world would there be a problem showing the complete, unedited versions on DVD of shows that were in their original network run only a year ago? Surely the silly copyright problems preventing older shows from being released uncut have been settled for the newer shows? Or should we just accept the fact that the loyal fans of these great shows will forever be screwed by corporations that will never give a damn about anything but our money?",1191888000,4,1370,4.618852459016393

2888389,5,B000SO7PCO,"I missed this show altogether when it first aired (on CBS I think), and am so glad that I discovered it now; I am in the third season and heartily recommend the program; life in the eighties as seen by a young black man going to a white school in Brooklyn. It is both touching and hilarious at the same time; I love all the characters, especially Chris' family; and the school staff is something else, too. Everyone gets exposed from time to time, no matter what race or class or profession. I recommend the show in its entirety based on what I have seen so far--great for the whole family!",1404000000,,590,4.324324324324325

2888391,5,B000SO7PCO,"This is such a hysterical show.  You can't help but enjoy every moment of it.  In addition to the outstanding cast and great acting, Chris Rock's narration puts this show in the top 10 sitcoms for me, ever!  It was a shame when it ended, but it's understandable where it ended (unlike some of our other beloved shows).  Glad Amazon has this on instant video so we can watch epi's again and again.  Trust me, if you have even the smallest funny bone, it'll get hammered!!!",1403481600,,471,4.430232558139535

2888396,5,B000SO7PCO,"I didn't get to see all the episodes the first time around, so I am really enjoying not missing a minute.  Sitcoms today are full of off-color jokes and topics unsuitable for children, but Chris is good family fun.",1401753600,,214,4.487179487179487

2888465,5,B000SO7PCO,"Chris Rock and Ali Le Roi really made a hit with this show. It is authentic, genuine and hilarious all at once. Even the racial slurs that Caruso makes to Chris cracks me up. This is a show that should have continued as long as the Cosby Show. It is shame that the plugged got pulled from this show. It should've never happened.
