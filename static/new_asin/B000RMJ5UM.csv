2869600,1,B000RMJ5UM,"This dvd opens with the title ""Battle of the Crimea Part One"". One big problem there is no Part Two!!! So the video ends with the build up to Manstein's attack on Sevastapol. The back cover clearly lists that the dvd includes all the events from October 1941 to the final German surrender in May 1944 - but not on my video !!!",1189555200,20,326,4.190476190476191
8201444,4,B000RMJ5UM,I love the Battlefield series but it seems the latter episodes are fraught with annoying errors.  The map maker apparently didn't know Roman numerals and the maps depict the 11th Army with VI (sixth in Roman numerals) instead of XI.  Once you get by such distractions it is a fascinating episode detailing the campaigns by which Germany took and then lost the Crimean Peninsula.,1430265600,,378,4.890625
8201445,3,B000RMJ5UM,"A good history channel- type movie about an interesting part of WW2. Contains a lot of doc footage. The obvious problems are: the footage is not always authentic (clips unrelated to the narrated events - obviously filmed other locations at a different time - are used to illustrate various campain events). The narration is considerably biased toward the German version of events ( not toooo much, but enough to make it obvious).",1400889600,,429,4.972222222222222
8201446,5,B000RMJ5UM,"Very clear description of the whole battle, maps were easy to follow, war footage was included,good information. This side battle was not necessary for the Germans,they went round Crimea anyway to get to the oilfields, another waste of manpower and energy.",1398816000,,256,5.2682926829268295
8201447,1,B000RMJ5UM,"If you are expecting the actual PBS Battlefield,,,,,,,,,,this aint it. This is a hastily thrown together feature for DVD only. I do no recommend it at  all.",1394668800,,156,4.777777777777778
8201448,5,B000RMJ5UM,"The feature showcases one of the greats from a military point of view.  Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein's unrivaled military talents and abilities are brought to the viewers attention.  Even a civilian can appreciate them.  The quality of the DVD is at the highest levels.  At many points, it would be a little tough for a civilian to even follow much less understand but I'm sure they'd like it.  The DVD is top notch entertainment and top quality factually and historically speaking.  The only caveat I would include is that it is a pure war DVD and isn't for children the themes including the audio-visual are not for children's eyes.  But, I think it's a must own for any adult even though it can be very tough for a civilian to follow.",1375660800,,748,4.66412213740458
8201449,5,B000RMJ5UM,I expected nothing less than a good DVD and was not disappointed. For any Russian front buff or for someone who wants to get a snapshot of Von Manstein's  genius. It clearly shows how superior training and  flexibility were the trademark of the German Army the first two years in the east. It also shows how the Russians turned the tables on the Germans when they retook it in record time.,1368316800,2,389,4.464788732394366
8201450,3,B000RMJ5UM,"This campaign was a minor operation compared to what the other Battlefield DVD's covered (ie. Stalingrad, D-Day, Battle of Britain), and has very limited footage and a lot of recycled shots and obviously stretched out narration.  This would make a decent chapter in a multi-campaign DVD, but as a stand alone it just did not have enough material to justify the length.",1356134400,,368,4.935483870967742
8201451,5,B000RMJ5UM,"I recently purchased this DVD, and I had no idea that there were different versions of this out there. But I think that I have the more complete Cromwell version. BUT, although I have watched most serious dvd's on World War 2, and I have read scores of books, this dvd was amazing. I never, never had a sense of how massive the battles for the Crimea were before watching this DVD. Stalingrad is known to everyone, but the battles in the Crimea during World War 2 were larger. The Germans were brilliantly led as they conquered the Crimea, but the Soviets eventually won it back. The battles were massive, larger than Stalingrad. The scenery, the shots of the Crimea are beautiful. This DVD is a buried treasure and I highly recommend it.",1344902400,2,738,4.556390977443609
8201452,2,B000RMJ5UM,"This review concerns the full length (150 minutes)Cromwell version of this program.  The production is really a mixed bag.  The best parts are the narration and maps, which provide the viewer with a very detailed explanation of the 1941-1945 campaigns in which the Axis conquered, then lost, the Crimean peninsula. The strategic considerations and operational obstacles faced by both sides are well covered.  The video portion of the program is less satisfactory, particularly the lack of synchronization between the narrative and the onscreen images. Too often, the speaker describes an attack occurring in December while the screen shows German tanks raising clouds of dust on parched summer steppes, or one hears of the efforts made by Soviet troops to frantically fortify defensive positions while images play of German engineers at work. The films' repetitive use of the same video sequences (t-34s moving forward, tired troops trudging uphill, a single truck driving through a ruined landscape) to depict different actions occurring months apart is also quite frustrating. By far, the biggest disappointment for this viewer was being teased by a detailed description of the mammoth ""Karl"" and ""Dora"" siege guns firing against Sevastopol without being shown a single picture of them (the onscreen images are of lesser caliber K5 ""Anzio Annie"" type railroad guns on other fronts!). One is left with the cummulative impression that the film was made in two separate parts, which were hurriedly combined to produce a disjointed whole.  It therefore pales in comparison to earlier films in the Battlefield series.",1279929600,15,1614,5.367588932806324
8201453,5,B000RMJ5UM,"I have the original Cromwell version that was reissued in the US in 2007. This is a fantastic program and is the same one that was broadcst on the Discovery Channel. Much of this footage is from Russian archives and has not been seen before. The earlier edition put out by Eagle is incomplete as noted in the other review. You want to own the Cromwell edition of this program. This is the original, full length version not the other truncated versions. Ironically, the complete version is actually cheaper that the abridged version. Go figure.",1190160000,27,543,4.726315789473684
