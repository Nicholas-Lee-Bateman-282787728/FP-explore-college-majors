As he covers the four topics in the above title, you find yourself listening to him and asking the questions are these things, these concepts correct or true. If so, you will become enlighten as to other possibilities.

5510219,1,B00AU6LVGQ,"Author is self absorbed. Rather than an open minded scientific approach, he basically rehashes his PhD dissertation. He has a disdain for Sitchin's work simply because Sitchin didn't major in theology related languages. Skip it!",1371686400,4,228,5.542857142857143

8557875,5,B00AU6LVGQ,"You have to be able to sit through a lecture that goes deep into Biblical studies, History, and Linguistics . . .  but if you can, this presentation is off the hook! This is truly ""Michael Heiser Unleashed"" in all of his scholarly glory.

The information is above top notch.  Sadly though, people don't want to think and would rather be entertained.  So therefore I recommend a cage match between Michael Heiser and Erich von Daniken as that will be the only way to get the truth out to the masses.  www.johnnycox.me",1421798400,4,516,4.565217391304348
