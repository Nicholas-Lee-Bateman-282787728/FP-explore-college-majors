6223453,3,B00HUQC442,"Been looking forward to this release for awhile!  3 of the greatest singer/songwriters in Music History!

How could the audio engineer/recording engineer put this crap out???

What a disgrace the awesome Musicians!!!!

The Setlist is diverse, spans several decades as expected!

The BAND, and the musicians i.e. the Rhythm Section are SICKLY GOOD!~!!!!
For Shannon to go from drumming from Tim McGraw to this Jazzy venue is beyond awesome!

I really wanted to give this a 5 Talent Wise; however the audio engineers really screwed this up!

Disappointed with the Audio team beyond belief!",1395100800,16,587,5.180851063829787
6223454,5,B00HUQC442,"I've always been a casual fan of Steely Dan and Boz Scaggs and never thought much of Michael McDonald.  So, I thought this might be worth getting.  What I got, far exceeded my expectations! More simply put...I am blown away!  Incredible performances by all three guys...not to mention all of the other top notch musicians playing with them.  As amazing as all of them are, the stand out, for me, is Boz Scaggs.  Wow! This guy's vocals are spot on, as well as his guitar playing!  Every song in this concert is a standout, but the highlight for me was Pretzel Logic, where each guy took lead vocals on each of the verses.  I could go on and on, but just buy the damn thing! You WILL NOT be sorry!",1395100800,100,695,4.3
6223455,1,B00HUQC442,"It is with profound sadness that this item will be returned.  Can't understand why, in 2014 with HD sound available ... why would a musical blu-ray - with this caliber of musicianship - be released with 5.1 sound???  Very sad.",1395100800,8,226,4.625
6223456,5,B00HUQC442,I saw the show in Sonoma and it was a fabulous night of good feelin' music. So many memories and such great sound. I have to put a plug in for guitarist Jon Herington who is phenomenal. I mean Scaggs is good but Herington just blew me away. Herington has been the lead guitarist for the band for several years now. Can't wait for my copy to arrive! Saw it on public tv last night and it brought all the feelings of the concert right back.,1394668800,18,438,4.104651162790698

6223485,5,B00HUQC442,"I had recorded the show on my DVR when it was shown on PBS and expected to keep it indefinitely, but it got deleted during a power failure.  Not knowing when it would be rebroadcast, I bought the DVD.  The program is fabulous; I can watch it over and over.  At age 74, I'm not a contemporary music fan or a ""rocker"" -- in fact just about all of the music (?) broadcast on the airwaves is....well, I don't want to get censored out here! I have to admit, even going back to the 70s, I never followed McDonald, Scaggs and Fagen (how can anyone not like Steely Dan, right?), but this show just knocked my socks off in all respects.  The unique performances of the ""Dukes"", the musical arrangements (which to me sounded more like a blend of contemporary sounds and jazz), the musical harmonies of the saxes and trumpet, and the musicians who are as artful and skilled as you can get.  The drummer was just fantastic -- he kept the rhythm going in perfect syncopation and defined his ""style"" without hogging the performance.  All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable show presented by a group of unique artists.",1496707200,2,1099,4.47
6223486,5,B00HUQC442,"Just had to add my voice to the chorus of rave reviews.  If you have even a passing interest in any of these three artists, buy this.  You owe it to yourself.  Some people have said that Michael McDonald's voice is a bit rough and that's true, but he's still great, especially on ""Takin' it to the Streets"" and the closing song, ""Them Changes"".  Donald Fagan is his usual self (and he does look like Bernie Sanders as someone said, I couldn't put my finger on who he reminded me of!).  Boz Scaggs is outstanding.  He continually kills it and makes it look easy.  So cool.  His voice is easily as good or better than it was in the 70's.  He really shines on ""The Same Thing"", ""Love T.K.O."". the verse he sings on ""Pretzel Logic"", and of course, ""Lowdown"".  If you want to hear great musicians laying down a great groove, get this.  Makes you wish you had been there.",1495929600,,865,4.3105590062111805

This record misses depth of the scene, depth of the bass, crystal cleaness of highs, and even voice timbre perfection.

6223491,5,B00HUQC442,"Enjoyed the solos from Fagen--never a strong voice, but clearly making concessions to more limited range--and McDonald, also exhibiting some voice limitations.

But Boz Scaggs knocked me out, voice as good as ever, and making sharp contributions on guitar as well.

Otherwise, the band is largely the musicians backing Becker and Fagen for Steely Dan tours, so they're tighter that two pairs of Spanx. Sound recording is good, the camera work is solid if unspectacular. In all, a great show.",1483315200,5,491,5.125

6223537,5,B00HUQC442,"At first I thought I was not going to like this because Walter Becker is not here, but after a few beers I ended up playing this concert about 6 times in a row. Back when I was growing up most of these songs were the themes of my night life. I always loved Michael McDonalds  soul stuff and Boss Scaggs 'Lowdown' and the other songs by him. Of course I bought this for Donald Fagen which when it came down to it, this was all the stuff I was buying as a youth and up to now.
Let's see now, if you were in your early 20's when this stuff was coming out you are going to want to swing back to time. None of these guys have lost their voices and personally they are almost better now then ever. True masters at their game and perfected some.
Here is the line up in exact order.
1. People get up and drive your funky soul.
2. Who's that lady?
3. I keep forgettin'
4. Kid Charlemagne
5. The same thing
6. Miss Sun
7. You never can tell
8. What a fool believes
9. Hey nineteen
10. Love T.K.O.
11. Peg
12. Lowdown
13. Takin' it to the streets
14. Reelin' in the years

his own stuff, look out! He takes it home!",1447718400,2,278,4.072727272727272
6223552,5,B00HUQC442,"Incredible live concert featuring Boz Scaggs, Donald Fagen & Michael McDonald! While McDonald's vocals are not what they once were (or maybe he was having an ""off"" night, but these musicians are all so talented, surely they could have played his songs in a lower key to provide his throat some relief) the concert overall is spectacular! It's given me a whole new appreciation for Fagen's genius and for more of his solo work and Steely Dan. And of course, Scaggs is the whole reason I bought this DVD.

6223573,3,B00HUQC442,"I wasn't sold on the Dukes tours and ended up sitting them out. This DVD makes me wish I had gone to a show or two. The performances are great, the arrangements of the cover tunes have that unmistakable Fagen-touch and the band (mostly Steely Dan touring alums) can't be beat. The concert is well-shot and edited.

All vocals, however, are excessively tuned almost beyond recognition. I understand these guys are aging and some post-production work was probably necessary. But the heavy handed use of Melodyne or whatever plugin they used strips the vocal performances of every nuance. I'm no purist; I know that professional live releases are probably going to have digitally tuned vocals, but this is ridiculous.",1440460800,3,714,5.0

I would have given it three stars the first time because it didn't blow me away and the arrangement of the live songs was so so but watching again gave me a greater appreciation for whole show. Also, I reserve 5 stars for concert blu rays like Talking Heads stop making sense (awesome all around), Chris Botti (sound an picture second to none), Toto (hello, they're Toto) so I think 4 stars is fair here because Dukes doesn't reach the echelon of concerts I just listed... Fagen's voice sounded off to me the first time but better the second. Mike McD was consistent but he won't blow you away. Boz is mostly what got this blu ray an additional star. I loved watching him the second time around. I know he plays guitar, though I think he's faking it through a couple parts of the show. Anyone else think so?",1440028800,,863,4.4

The supporting band is outstanding, especially John Herington on Guitar, Freddie Washington on bass and Shannon Forrest on drums. I'm a drummer and I never heard of or seen this young man play drums. He did an excellent job. I think Donald said "" and tonight from Memphis TN Shannon Forrest"" during the band introduction. This gave me the impression that he was a ""fill in"" for the night or new on the tour.  Either way keep an eye out for this guy on drums!!!!  I have one issue. The video production was spot on.  The audio  was no way as good as it should have been. The balance between some of  the instruments was poor. Sometimes some instruments were buried in the mix. It sounded like it was mixed ""on the fly"" The sound level of the bass was weak throughout the gig. That is the heartbeat of the recording...Freddie was playing his ass off and was barely in the mix.  The overall sound needed  EQ fine tuning. Sounded flat with little dynamics....You would think that the audio should be at least as good as then video was.  Anyway, the performances were still a joy to watch. The sound is the major drawback of this production...Donald should have insisted that Roger Nichols or Elliot Scheiner or Al Schmit be at the mixing board during the performance and post production.

6223585,4,B00HUQC442,"This concert is ""so-so"". They should have stuck with just playing their own songs. That is what people want to hear. When they did play their own songs, they did a good job. I thought the best performance came when they played ""Pretzel Logic"". One of my all time favorite Steely Dan songs! The sound quality of the concert could have been better too. The bluray seemed to lack ""pop"" and I have a very good surround system with the best set up for sound and picture quality. Overall I'd say if you like these guys, you'll enjoy the concert.

6223591,3,B00HUQC442,"I just upgraded my home theater (new HD projector and receiver) and wanted to get something that would show it off better than the DVDs I currently have (i.e. get BluRay's lossless audio and HD video). Although I like all three of the featured artists, I don't think I will be keeping this disc. There are several things that make concert video enjoyable to me (in order of importance): musical performance, audio quality, video quality. I would rate this disc as follows:

Performance - C  (not enough of the artist's material, lack of energy, average arrangements)
Audio Quality - C  (strange mix with low vocal levels, no sense of being in the auditorium, McDonald's keyboards are MIA except on one or two songs. Low dynamic range)
Video Quality - B (nice lighting and decent views and editing, full HD experience)

The only song on the album that I enjoyed was 'Takin it to the Streets' which allowed me to forget about the bad mix due to the energetic and heart-felt performance. I was also wowed by MM's piano performance. I had assumed the reason I never heard his instrument until then was that he must not be very good, but that is obviously not the reason!

For reference, DVDs I consider much better as concert DVDs (and yes they are DVDs, not BLuRay) are: James Taylor at the Beacon Theater, Eagles: Hell Freezes Over, Cream: Live at Royal Albert Hall.

If I want to listen to music, all I have to do is put in the CD or fire up Pandora. A concert video is a different thing and requires time and attention and should reward the viewer with something they can't get by just listening to a CD.

6223600,5,B00HUQC442,"Buying this 2014 Live Concert DVD is a no brainer if you love Donald Fagen (Aja), Michael McDonald (Doobie Brothers) and Boz Scaggs!  I've seen all three in their own Live Concert DVD's made years ago and not real impressed.  But, the magic all comes together with this one...and the producer and sound / lighting techs made it great as well.  Also, you can tell all three musicians are close and comfortable singing together, etc.

If I was to pick the best performer it would have to be Boz Scaggs.  His voice sounded great just like back in the 70's and early 80's.  And his ""Miss Sun"" duet with one of his backup singers was a highlight of the Concert.  Of course, Donald Fagen and Michael McDonald were awesome in their own right too!

6223682,3,B00HUQC442,"I adore all three of these mega-talented artists. But, I must say I was very disappointed by the short play-list, inadequate sound recording quality, and the delivery of their performances. Boz Scaggs delivered the best performance of the three. I was extremely disappointed by Michael McDonald's renditions of his famous hit songs. And although Donal Fagen is still an excellent keyboardist, his vocals have worsened over time as well.

I would still go to see them in person if they decide to perform in the northwest again, but they really need to work on their performance.  I know they can do better than what is demonstrated by this DVD. I bought the Blu-ray option and used outstanding Bose headphones, so I know it wasn't poor equipment on my part.

Please don't give up, Dukes of September. Just raise your quality level to what it used to be. I know you can!!! There are still lots of us out here that would love to buy your new releases if you raise the bar.",1414800000,2,969,4.622093023255814

6223710,5,B00HUQC442,"The song list, band, sound, picture and camera work on this disc is near-flawless. Boz Scaggs sounds identical to how he used to sound back in the Silk Degrees days, plus even more soulful, and plays a mean guitar to boot - he is clearly the biggest surprise on this concert. His range seems totally unaffected by the intervening years, and he's 70! On the other hand, Michael McDonald's range is severely restricted, so anything an octave or more above his comfort zone sounds strained and hoarse, plus he has an annoying tendency to move his head in and out of microphone range as he's grooving along. But he's still an amazing, soulful singer and pianist, and his background vocals make you realize just how many of these songs he sang on the original recordings. Donald Fagen (who put together the band and the arrangements) looks like a muppet when he sings, and his vocals often are a whisper of what they used to be, but at least he sings on key. The band is incredible, especially Jon Herrington, who tours as Steely Dan's guitarist; Shannon Forrest, the drummer (who seems to be talking to himself or counting beats out loud); and Monet, one of the background singers who steps out in front for a few duets. Finally, the eclectic song list leaves you wondering what other wonderful tracks were left off the disc.

Only additional complaints: on my expensive and properly calibrated home theater system, the low end is a bit lacking, and the vocals have excessive reverb when set to any surround (Dolby Digital or DTS) mode.",1412553600,,1532,4.695167286245353

McDonald has a habit of turning his head away from the microphone at the end of some phrases and so some words sound clipped.  Horn section was OK. Audience was somewhat  laid-back for much of the concert so the concert did not have an ""electric"" atmosphere .  But I would recommend this concert to any fans of Fagen, McDonald and Scaggs.

But, I am a long time fan of Mike McDonald and Boz Scaggs and I really love their music! It broke my heart to see that Michael seemed to be having trouble hitting those high notes that he is famous for. But, it was still wonderful. I would have liked to have heard more from Boz , but the few songs he sang was music to my ears. He never fails.

They compliment each other's work by sharing the song selections and hits of each other and adding some of their own personal favorites as well. These guys are the real deal and their combined bodies of work speak for themselves. A triple good time for all who see and hear this!!!",1404086400,2,582,4.772277227722772

Michael McDonald and Donald Fagan's music are in every music program that I listen to. Boz Scaggs  music is pure blues and soul. I need to get his music on my list.

I'm going to buy another copy for my sister.

Just hearing them together made my heart glad.",1403222400,,418,4.0120481927710845

6223818,3,B00HUQC442,"I am still recommending this blu-ray, with the caveat that the sound quality is less than pristine. Dynamic range is just "" not there"" and the crispness I hear on other nicely recorded outings such as Chris Botte at Symphony hall , or Michael Buble at the Wiltern is just missing on this recording.
That being said , the sound quality issue is not likely to be noticed unless one is listening on high end equipment.
Michael MacDonald reprising his back up vocals on the Steely Dan songs is quite a treat, and I am more than pleased that this is finally available for public viewing.",1402963200,7,582,4.5
6223819,5,B00HUQC442,"I've seen the Dukes Live several times, having taken them in at various places over the years, Minneapolis, Aspen, and Chicago. They never disappoint because frankly, these three guys really ENJOY this format and being able to get outside of their personal bands and projects and just play with their friends and a killer set of musicians. If you've never seen Steely Dan, The Doobie Brothers, or Boz Scaggs live, you're in for an unbelievable treat, because this Blu-ray is like getting to see the high points of all three performers.
The band is incredible, and their performances on this wonderful night at Lincoln Center are superb. Jon Herrington is an amazing guitarist, the horn section is world class, the bass is handled with aplomb by Freddie Washington, and the backup singers are incredible! Both Carolyn Leonhart and Monet Owens are at the top of their industry for their performance chops. Check out Monet on her duet with Boz for ""Miss Sun."" They've been doing this song together regularly for a good fifteen years, and it never gets stale.
The lineup of songs that the Dukes cover is a Hall of Fame of seventies, eighties and more recent classics, including gems from all three performers careers. Highlights are many, but my favorite moments in the show are: I Keep Forgettin', Miss Sun, Love T.K.O., Peg, Lowdown, Takin' It To The Streets, and Pretzel Logic. The Dukes' cover of Them Changes and their cover of Who's That Lady would have made Steve Winwood and The Isley Brothers proud.
This show gives me chills at times, and you will want to add this to your concert collection. Be prepared to be surprised by how good this is and how strong it is from start to finish. These guys are some of the finest singers and performers in the business, and you'll be glad you gave this a watch and a listen!",1402876800,3,1818,4.702194357366771

The supporting band is top notch and are spot on for this performance. This concert will give you a sampling of each of these ""Masters"" works. The set list is excellent and you will enjoy from beginning to end.
On Blu-ray in 5.1 surround this DVD is amazing. This is a must have in any music lovers collection.

The best thing about this Live Registration is the performance. Even Donald seems to really enjoy himself a lot, so this is surely not one of the annoying concerts he is referring to in Eminent Hipsters!
Donald, Michael and Boz prove that older mucisians can still sing well, although of course they don't reach the level they used to have, when they were in their twenties ot thirties. For me that doesn't matter, since I'm halfway between 50 and 60 myself, I can just appreciate their effort in maintaining their skills as performers.",1401321600,,621,4.706422018348624

Individually, I am a Big Boz Scaggs fan, I really like Donald Fagan and Steely Dan & although I actually preferred the Doobie Brothers pre Michael McDonald, I do like Michael McDonald. When I saw this DVD (new at a great price nonetheless) it was a must have for me. It is a great show & they really complement one another very well. They are doing their own individual tunes as well as doing music from the past that influenced them individually. They rotate back & forth between taking the lead on songs & back one another up on each others songs. The thing that surprised me was how well they meshed with one another and harmonized together. A great line up of songs and a very different concert to put on. I play a lot of concerts on the home theater and you usually have one band on for 90 minutes or so. It is great to put a concert on and have this great variety within the show and not have any real lulls. Buy & enjoy, you won't be disappointed.",1400457600,3,1101,4.19811320754717

The Lincoln Center/NYC is a very colorful venue and video worthy--the Met still release video performances of their operas to paying theater audiences throughout the country!  The greatest hits package is indeed more satisfying than the retro-what-influenced-us-as-kids fare.  I was thoroughly impressed with Boz Scaggs' contribution to the group;  big bluesy guitar sound, supple vocals, incredible songs and execution (i.e., MISS SUN).  So glad they recorded this show as a testament to their incredible collaboration.  Again, what a neat idea!!!  :D  :D :D",1400371200,2,651,5.551020408163265

Some R&B chestnuts are also in the mix.,1400371200,,319,4.818181818181818

I had the pleasure of seeing them together in the 1990's when Steely Dan decided to try their hand at touring. Adding Boz Scaggs music to the mix brings a whole other dimension. Boz's catalog by itself is impressive. If you're not familiar start with his multi-platinum ""Silk Degrees"". So, what you really have here are three concerts in one: Steely Dan, Doobie Brothers, and Boz. Check it out!",1400198400,,538,4.923076923076923

6223869,3,B00HUQC442,"Of the trio, Boz has maintained his vocal ability the best, closely followed by D. Fagan.  McDonald is another story. He is obviously the weakest link, often chopping words in half to complete his lines and straining to hit the high notes. I'm trying not to be too hard on the guy but they must have photo-shopped his cover photo cause he doesn't look like that on the stage. The backup band is competent but the white backup singer looks like she's appearing on stage for the first time(kind of hard not to take your eyes off of her). I've watched it more than once so it isn't that bad. Guess I expected more.",1399075200,,611,4.359649122807017

6223872,5,B00HUQC442,"These guys have been around for a long time and I've followed them for many years as Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers and Boz Scaggs since the '70's.
Boz Scaggs was the biggest surprise for me as his voice sounds as full and clear as it did 30-40 years ago.  Michael McDonald looked not quite as happy performing, sounding good if a bit strained in his performance.  Donald Fagan looks a bit weird but performed with valor on the Steely Dan songs.
Altogether with a great band and excellent backup singers, it's hard not to love these guys putting a new spin on these old tunes.
Very happy with my purchase as I can revisit these guys anytime by popping in my disc.
Love it.
Just an audio note, while I think the performance was great, the audio is just ok sounding...lacking in lively detail and sounding a little flat(Dynamically not pitch).",1398729600,,842,4.532894736842105

6223879,5,B00HUQC442,"Having never seen any of the three live, snapped this album up immediately.  Although Michael's voice has weakened through the years, his passion for the music hasn't.  Remembered Michael's connection with Donald from the Aja album and the background vocals.  Especially on Peg.  Boz's connection to Donald isn't quite as obvious.  Actually think his cuts were the highlights of this disc.  Donald is, well Donald.  Been a fan since the early days of Steely Dan when they were thought of as ""just another guitar band"".  You will get out of this album exactly what YOU want.  I did!",1398556800,,581,4.846938775510204
6223880,5,B00HUQC442,It has most of the favorite songs you would want to hear from each of the performers (especially Boz Scaggs).,1398470400,,109,4.5

6223883,3,B00HUQC442,The 3 of them were great together sharing their own songs as well as some of McDonalds favorite oldies.. The vocals were really good but that's all you get from the mix? There's not much low end & the band is really buried in the mix? Maybe that's what they wanted but I was not happy with the sound except for the vocals..,1398384000,13,323,4.142857142857143

6223885,5,B00HUQC442,Saw this concert in person. Glad to see it on Blu-ray. Also check out the The New York Rock and Soul Revue. It was a musical project which evolved from a series of concerts and musical shows produced by Libby Titus that lasted from 1989 to 1992. This tour was a resurrection of that series of shows.,1398384000,,299,4.2631578947368425

6223899,5,B00HUQC442,"Looking perhaps a bit more portly around the old midriff than one would like  our three ageing heroes take centre stage after the band has warmed up the crowd with a funky James Brown instrumental. And were off

Filmed November 2012 in Hi Def and from multiple angles  The Dukes Of September looks glorious - with the Lincoln Centre surely being one of the most beautiful venues in the world (and ideally sized too). You also begin to notice as the camera pans around the stunning band that the paint on the bass guitar is knackered, the sax is a bit rusted around the gills and the keyboards White Lightning McDonald uses has been teleported from 1976 to 2012. In other words  these are real instruments played by real musicians - and it feels like your very own Aja band 'live'  a complaint Ill gladly put up with any day of the week.

First up is a truly classy cover of The Isley Brothers Whos That Lady with Boz Scaggs taking lead vocals and long-time Steely Dan guitarist Jon Herington putting in blistering axework. In fact he becomes one of the heroes of the night  playing all those Jay Graydon, Larry Carlton and Elliott Randall solos weve known and loved all these years  not just note for note  but with an added fluidity  like he in fact played them in the first place.

The first real clunker for me is an ill-advised cover of Sam and Daves Sweet Soul Music (more cod Blues Brothers than a tribute to a classic) and a slightly underwhelming I Keep Forgettin also follows. But things explode when Donald Fagen goes into the funky keyboard opening of Kid Charlemange from 1976s The Royal Scam - and you can literally hear the entire audience thinking two words  STEELY DAN! The place erupts  because theyve waited a lifetime to hear this  the real deal  live and in your living room.

Its followed by a fabulous bluesy cover of The Same Thing - a Muddy Waters Chess nugget from 1964 written by the mighty Willie Dixon. Its followed by a genius choice  Chuck Berrys infectious You Never Can Tell with McDonald playing an Accordion out front to superb effect (uses it instead of a piano for the solo giving the song a slight Cajun feel).

But after crowd-pleasing versions of What A Fool Believes, Hey Nineteen and Teddy Pendergrass sexy Love TKO  they hit the audience with a lethal triple whammy that slays them in the aisles. We get Peg (Fagen on Vocals), Lowdown (Scaggs on Vocals) and Takin It To The Streets (McDonald On Vocals) in a row. To hear Michael McDonald harmonize with Donald Fagen on Peg as he did on the 1977 Aja original is magical  then Boz gets fabulous and funky with Lowdown (people up dancing at this stage)  then a Soulful keyboard solo before McDonald goes into that Takin It To The Streets opening - and Im bawling my eyes out like a big girls blouse. And as if that isn't bad enough  Jon Herington then launches into the blistering guitar of Steely Dans Reelin In The Years  and resistance is quite literally futile.

Theres also a couple of tasty surprises thrown in: Fagen in the encore doing a fabulously slinky version of Pretzel Logic with Boz Scaggs taking the second verse - while midway through the set Scaggs does his own Miss Sun  a gorgeous yet forgotten gem from his 1977 Down Two Then Left album. Boz cleverly duets the lovely melody with Monet Owens (one of the sassy backing vocalists)  she scatting vocals off his guitar licks towards the end. Its brilliant and more than a pleasant addition. And the band are just brilliant  all of them.

Im 56 this year and would have given a small gonad to have seen and felt this dream band for real. The music still feels fresh to me  like it was yesterday. But in lieu - this fab BLU RAY will have to do.

And as the camera pans across the senior citizen crowd  like me - you can see that its way past their bedtime. But man  what dreams to savour

I have never met Napoleonbut I plan to find the timeyes I do

I know what you mean mate.

6223900,1,B00HUQC442,"This concert had so much potential.  I thank PBS for bringing this concert to us, but what the heck happened to the audio?  I purchased the Blu-Ray version of this disc.  In today's age, with great recording and mastering capabilities, it's sad to see this level of audio quality on such a great concert.

I'm the guy who likes to rip the audio portion of the disc and put it on my music server at home.  This is when you can really tell the quality of the audio - when you listen without the video portion.  Our vision takes quite a bit away from our auditory senses, so one isn't much inclined to say this is poor quality recording when watching it with the video.  But once you separate the two, and your auditory senses are heightened, you realize the poor quality recording.

I loved this concert as a whole.  Excellent performers playing some great old tunes.  But I'm really disappointed in the producers/engineers who worked on the audio section.

I analyzed the 5.1 audio portion on my computer using good old Audacity.  You can visibly see there is barely any LFE.  And the use of surround speakers is minimal - pretty much limited to the crowd cheering.  I know some audiophiles like the audio coming from the front only, but I like the ""stage"" presence.  For example, Roy Orbison's Black & White concert uses all of your speakers and sounds tremendous.  Eric clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival's sound fantastic using all channels in an uncompressed format.

This concert had so much potential!  Most people, who don't know how to listen to music probably won't find much wrong with this disc.  But if you have the proper system, and you know what to listen for, you'll be disgusted at how such a good concert could be shred into pieces by it's audio quality.",1398211200,10,1773,4.625

6223902,5,B00HUQC442,"This DVD exceeded expectations in every way.  Excellent musicianship, song selection and sound quality.  The broad song selection also showed the versatility of the cast as musicians.  And I'd guess a lot of viewers didn't realize how good a guitar player Boz Scaggs is.  Very professionally done by all.",1398211200,,304,5.142857142857143
6223903,3,B00HUQC442,"I have many Blu ray audio discs. This one rates a 3 on a scale of 1-10 for its sub par audio. There should be a minimum standard for blu ray audio discs, including universal's ""pure audio"" discs.",1398124800,9,195,4.157894736842105

6223905,4,B00HUQC442,"I love all three of these guys and when I saw they got (back) together, I jumped at this purchase. It was a fantastic show! Here's why I only gave 4 stars.
Only a handful of the songs were performed by ""The Dukes of September"" where all three contributed heavily. Most of the show however was each individual singing his hits. I like the hits so I still enjoyed it. Boz sounded like Boz, dead on! Michael has a lazy sounding mouth when he sings now, like he's had a stroke. But he still sounds good. Donald is a jazz musician, so he plays and sings jazz, changing rhythms and progressions up in his hits. Overall, satisfied. Not blown away though.",1398038400,2,647,4.355371900826446
6223906,5,B00HUQC442,"absolutely 5* for its quality, content , total class , all encapsulated in the wonderful music. This is exactly what one would expect of this Dukedom, and most of the Steely Dan touring band.",1398038400,,191,4.647058823529412

6223918,5,B00HUQC442,"I caught this concert during a PBS fund raiser.  Years ago I was at a show featuring Donald Fagan, Walter Becker, Boz Scaggs, and Michael McDonald live, and they called themselves The New York Rock And Soul Review. The band included the late, great Phoebie Snow (RIP), and Charles  Brown. Drew Zing shared guitar duties with Walter Becker. This DVD is amazing, and I immediately searched, and pre-ordered it from Amazon. Jon Herrington is Larry Carlton, Skunk Baxter, Walter Becker, and countless other studio cats, that can just play. He had the technique, ""the brown sound"", and chops to play solos like the legendary  Larry Carlton's, Kid Charlemagne solo, almost better than Larry!  OK, I won't go there, because Larry Carlton, is in that elite category that won him those Grammies. Boz Scaggs still has the guitar and vocal chops of his youth. Michael McDonald sang back up vocals on Steely Dan's Katy Lied LP, long before his Doobie Brothers gig. He has more of a black man soul voice, than most black soul singers!  I mean no disrespect because, Marvin Gaye, Al Greene,up to and including, the likes of Bruno Mars, had the magic, and somehow Michael got some of it. That's my 2!",1397952000,4,1185,4.760975609756097

The Dolby Digital came across well. Boz clearly has the same voice and has not lost  thing. The 3 blended well with each other. The lead guitar player in the band was outrageous.

6223966,2,B00HUQC442,"I've seen them in concert twice in the past two years and I remained UNDERWHELMED by the live performances. Michael McDonald and Donald Fagan have carried most of the load joined by a very good band. HOWEVER, Mr. Scaggs was almost missing in action during the both shows that I attended, content to play a few guitar riffs and a offer a few vocals in addition to two or three of his own songs. A low point was their cover of the Grateful Dead's ""Breakdown Street"", a refugee from the disco-Dead era of the late '70's. (This tune is not on the dvd).
Now some people get so excited when they go see their pop & rock heroes in concert, and they fawn endlessly over them. I cannot do that here. Their performances were average at best. I have seen all three perform at a much higher level as solo acts or with their own respective groups in the past, and that is how I choose to remember them. Nostalgia is a dangerous thing, kids. The late, great Lester Bangs reminds us to be absolutely brutal when considering the merits if our favorite performers. These guys need to get hit hard upside their heads for such lackluster performances. A brutal, hard review can only help them look at themselves and get better.

Never mind the fact that McDonald practically destroyed the Doobie Brothers with his ""Granny Pop"" voice and arrangements - I was never so happy as when he skipped out on his own. Fortunately they returned to the Doobies' blues/rock sound that we know and love! The other too I have enjoyed for years but now strike me as more in the ""has-been"" category for some reason.

But hey, Donald Fagan I immediately know this has to be great because the Steely Dan albums were always recorded impeccably. I pop in my OPPO bluray player to watch it in 3D. Where is the sound? This is like listening to it on hifi vhs. How do I know? If music doesn't sound great on a pair of Klipschorns and a Klipsch Cornwall center channel, then it's not mastered well at all.

6223986,5,B00HUQC442,"There have been a few complaints about the audio because it is labeled as ""DTS 5.1 Audio"" on the back cover as well on the audio menu set-up on the disc; but look at the display on your receiver when playing the disc and you will see that it indicates that the disc is indeed DTS Master-HD and not DTS audio.",1395187200,13,308,4.065573770491803
6223987,4,B00HUQC442,"As much as I love this Blu ray, It could've been so much more.  How often to we get a group of musicians playing together on one stage that mesh so well together and the caliber of musicianship and class.  As much as I am happy something was documented on the Dukes Of September, why not spend a few bucks more to make it that much better.
 As it has been mentioned the audio has some weaknesses.  The 5.1 DTS or Dolby Digital is good, but it could've been ""Great"".  I have a high end home theater. Marantz Receiver and an OPPP-BDP 95/32Bit/DAC and high end PSB Speakers and Audio Quest (upper Level) Cables throughout.  I had to crank up very high to hear it, The PCM Stereo mix seemed to have more bottom end w/ out 5.1 separation.  The lower level's need to be mixed a lot better, some of the songs the vocals were being drowned out by the music.  Listen to the end of Preztel Logic When M.McD. was singing and adlibing towards the end, the vocal mix was way to low,  For DTS HD Master Audio mix, it just should've been more dynamic, better bottom end and the level a lot higher at lower level.
The Picture quality was flawless, the colors and flesh tones clear and accurate, patterns of jackets and shirts vivid and clear.

Now on to the content, Since the touring began in 2010, the shows have been 2 hour + and the songs changed a bit here and there, but a lot of songs seemed to be left off.  Maybe this set was cut down to 90 minutes. specificly for this PBS special, maybe someone who was there can mention if there were additional songs played, but not on the Blu-ray.  I know the broadcast was cut down to 60 minutes. to get folks interested and wanting more, so they would be interested in buying the DVD/Blu-Ray.  Michael McDonald has the power and voice to do songs like ""I've Got News For you"" (Mike belted that song out of the park) and If you Don't Know Me By Now.  As much as I know everyone knows What A Fool, but Keep This Train Rollin or Minute By Minute or even Here To Love You would've been much better song to do.  Mike has a ton of Solo Material as well, I was surprised what was chosen from his catalogue, (Just My Opinion on that).  No matter the current songs on the Blu-Ray, I just know there could've been another 30 + minutes that could've made this a 2 hour concert.  Bonus Features: NONE, HMMMMM.  This was another ball dropped.  At least roll a camera during sound check or rehersals and capture the interactions between the artist and band members along with some innerviews with each artist Boz, Michael and Donald. and put some thought into some additional features, it seems that this kind' of show does not always come around a lot, why not make the most of it.  As fans were never happy, we always want more or this song would've been better that that, it is just our nature, As much as I appreciate having this Blu-ray.  I am left wanting more and just giving my opinion on what could 've made this a better DVD.  In todays age in music being a popularity contest or a marketing contest, when you get 3 artists and a backup band of this nature,  I was just hoping the people that put this together would appreciate a bit more what they had.  Rock ON Michael, Boz and Donald.  Looking forward to M.McD. forthcoming solo CD later this year, maybe the Dukes will do a CD of original music mixed in with the classics they are performing today.... Peace, Mike S.",1395187200,32,3399,4.2982731554160125

I'm a conservative and it's obvious these guys didn't appreciate my ""fandom"" or support of their careers for all those years.  No thank you.  Never again.",1530403200,,265,4.36734693877551

Fantastic band playing with them and beautiful background vocalists-especially with the song Miss Sun-I just love it!
So happy I purchased this!",1517097600,,316,4.660714285714286
8635971,5,B00HUQC442,"What can I say about these 3 musicians.  I first saw bits of this concert on YouTube and I knew I had to get the Bluray.  Picture and sound quality is great, a disc worth having to watch it over and over.",1516838400,,204,3.8333333333333335

8635973,3,B00HUQC442,"Bought this DVD because it was the closest thing I could find to a video performance by Steely Dan.  Unfortunately,  the highly honed Hollywood-like
backup band made the music sound somewhere between the originals and elevator music.  I just kept finding myself wishing this was a performance by the original band.  Same was true for the Michael McDonald and Boz Scaggs numbers; they just sounded so much better with their original bands. Jon Herington does a fantastic job on lead guitar trying to make things sound like the originals, but it just isn't nearly enough.  Despite good performances and excellent production/technical qualities, I could only give this three stars due to the lack of the artists' original soul.",1511654400,,724,5.101694915254237
