4063935,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"Making the movie of Eat Pray Love must have been daunting.  How can a journey of self-discovery make an interesting film, even if it is set in three of the most amazing places on the planet?

Somehow it works seamlessly.  Eat Pray Love is a gorgeous film. It's funny and poignant and mesmerizing and moving, and it's restored my faith in movies. The filmmakers took a few liberties with Gilbert's book in the interest of pacing and story and the changes made it better.

Casting Julia Roberts as Elizabeth Gilbert was brilliant. Though we never forget we're watching Julia Roberts, in much the same way Bette Davis and Joan Crawford dominated their roles, she manages to be endearing and believable as she flounders in the wreckage of her life and tries to figure out what's next.  The amazing thing is that the effort behind her progress from depression to joy never shows.  It's demonstrated in subtle ways--roars of laughter at a still-frozen Thanksgiving turkey, pangs of memory and release of pain evoked by a wedding, mischievous glee at giving up her ""I'm in silence"" badge at the ashram. Julia Roberts' Elizabeth Gilbert is likeable and charming and her internal journey is wonderful to watch.

I liked the book, Eat Pray Love for the travel and the characters, but thought the self-discovery was a 'meh'--yet another spoiled baby-boomer dissatisfied with a life far better than that of 99.9% of the rest of the world who spent 400 pages and a year in the most amazing places on earth crying, ""Me me me"". I didn't like Elizabeth Gilbert very much and didn't totally buy a lot of the internal story, though I lapped up the tales of her experiences and the people she met on her travels.  Thanks to a really fine screenplay, we see the point to Eat Pray Love in a way that was sometime obscured in the book.  Thanks to a really fine cast, the supporting characters are just that, from Billy Crudup as Gilbert's hurt and bewildered ex-husband, James Franco as the actor who introduces Gilbert to meditation and Viola Davis as the best friend and sounding board.  Gilbert's circle of people in each of the three places she visits are pitch-perfect and never succumb to stereotype.  It should be noted that Richard Jenkins comes close to stealing the movie in India, as he exhorts Gilbert with AA-like fervor, variations of ""It works if you work it"" and ""keep coming back"" that mask regret and heartbreak. The scenes with him are some of the best in the movie, though there's not a weak link in the cast.

Even if you hated the book, Eat Pray Love is worth seeing as an example of a truly well-made movie with an exceptional cast--and be prepared to crave pizza margherita for days afterwards.",1281744000,13,2696,4.688559322033898
4063936,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"Isn't it nice to have the time, the resources, and the money to be able to travel the world and rediscover life, love, and spirituality? We should all be as lucky as Elizabeth Gilbert. Her memoir, ""Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia,"" has sold millions, been on the ""New York Times"" Best Seller list for 158 weeks, and touched the lives of thousands. One of them was Oprah Winfrey, who devoted two whole episodes of her show to the book. I admit that I haven't read it, but I have done a little research on it and on Gilbert herself. I have to say, I don't much care for her or her story. Her journey of discovery, paid for by an advance on a novel she plans to write, seemed awfully selfish, for she had no real absences in her life; she was married, had an education, was a successful writer, and lived comfortably in New York. This wasn't enough for her?

The film ""Eat Pray Love,"" which adapts Gilbert's story and has her portrayed by Julia Roberts, tells us that no, it wasn't enough. She divorces her husband (Billy Crudup), who, in an early divorce settlement scene, gave me more reason to side with him than with her. She has an affair with an attractive and all-around nice young actor (James Franco), which she then ends in a brazen display of tears brought on by God knows what. She then decides that it's time to take a year off and travel the world, to reconnect with herself, to once again have a zest for life - in other words, to escape from all the good things she had but never appreciated. She proceeds to spend four months in Italy, where she happily eats as much pasta and pizza as she can, with a few Napoleons on the side. She then spends the next four months in an Indian ashram, where the tries her hand at meditation, apparently under the impression that God can be grasped in one fell swoop. Finally, she goes to Bali, where she's presented with, but not necessarily willing to accept, love.

Along the way, she just happens to meet a number of people. Never mind the fact that they all greatly impact her life, as such people tend to do in stories like this; it's a miracle they can all speak fluent English. One of them, wouldn't you know it, just happens to be from the great state of Texas. In Italy, she befriends a sassy Swede and a charming Italian, a couple who look like they stepped out of a Giorgio Armani ad. In India, she meets the Texan (Richard Jenkins), a loveably gruff old man whose every line sounds like it originated from a fortune cookie. He, of course, has his own tragic back story, although he only shares it at just such a time when it's most convenient for the plot. In Bali, she reunites with the obligatory wise elder (Hadi Subiyanto), the long suffering divorcee (Christine Hakim), and Felipe (Javier Bardem), who enters her life as men tend to do in most forgettable romantic comedies.

There's nothing about this movie that feels authentic, and that's what infuriates me; it has the gall to pass itself off as an autobiography. I don't care how accurate Elizabeth Gilbert claims it is (she said during a ""Good Morning America"" interview that it played like a ""surreal home movie""). I don't believe her. This is the stuff of movies, not real life. Besides, she didn't visually document her journey at all - not a single photo, not a frame of film. All the more reason not to believe her. With so much doubt about the story's authenticity, and with Gilbert's questionable dismissal of the good life she so clearly had before making the journey, the film lacks any sense of spiritual enlightenment or emotional awakening; it comes off as little more than a portrait of a selfish woman on a sightseeing trip.

Julia Roberts is a wonderful actress, and even though I disliked the woman she played, I still thought she gave a good performance. Javier Bardem seems to be channeling the same dashing mystique he employed in the much, much better ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" which is to say he seems to be repeating himself, albeit competently. As for James Franco, let's just say that my mother has coined the perfect phrase for actors that display no range and speak in monotone lulls: ""They've just gotten a Novocain enema."" I don't know what director Ryan Murphy told him, but whatever he said, it was terrible advice. Franco is usually a very reliable, very convincing actor. Ever seen ""Milk""? Hell, ever seen ""Spider-Man""?

""Eat Pray Love"" is phony, contrived, and unpleasant, made worse by the fact that we're supposed to take it as fact. Don't bother sending me comments that I'm wrong and that everything in the film comes directly from Gilbert's actual experiences. I'm not going to believe you. If the filmmakers had followed the leads of the people behind ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and ""Letters to Juliet,"" who had the decency to label their films as works of fiction, then maybe I would have appreciated it more. But then again, no, I wouldn't have; there's still the matter of Elizabeth Gilbert, whose quest for meaning and happiness was really an exercise in trendy New Age mantra-talk and selfishness. The more I think about the journey she made, the less I like her as a person.",1281744000,40,5192,4.5905172413793105

4063964,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Julia Roberts may have liked the book and desperately wanted to be part of the movie but she was way too old. She looked to be in her mid-forties if not fifties and it took me out of the movie. Also, real relationships are hard to come by--true friends, those moments that you feel so connected to other people. Liz seemed to find this in everyone she met. Go get coffee-- the woman who orders for her becomes her best friend. Language teacher--best friend. Everyone she meets is that soul mate of a best friend. I've traveled a bit and I can tell you this doesn't happen. You may meet a person or two, but not EVERYONE. Even the medicine man in Bali tells her she's like his daughter. It  seemed forced and fake. I loved the book because maybe the relationships seemed more natural. This, not so much.",1516320000,,802,4.382550335570469

4064029,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"What a perfect flick for the entitled ME generation that wants it all and isn't concerned with who they hurt to get it.  Hey, you can't possibly be the reason your life is messed up; if you have a problem, don't face it or solve it -- just walk out of the situation. The main character screws her life up and blows up a fairly decent marriage, and for the rest of the movie, she gives the rest of us advice.

Here's another attempted rationalization of the main character's behavior:

""And we must take care of our families, wherever we find them. Today l saw Tutti playing with a blue tile she'd found in the road near a hotel construction site. She told me: Maybe if we have a house someday, it can have a pretty blue floor like this. When I was in Italy, I learned a word - It's ""tutti"" with double T, which in ltalian means ""everybody."" So that's the lesson, isn't it? When you set out in the world to help yourself, sometimes you end up helping Tutti.""

So much of the dialog was just as syrupy and sticky as that.  It's like you're at IHOP and you put your sleeve in some syrup and pretty soon it's on everything and you can't get it off.  One reviewer called it 'cheesy' -- that comment is spot on, imo.  ""Just hop from one affair to the next, and you'll be a better, happier person, because you'll gain something from each one.""  My wife could hardly stand it, and SHE picked the movie out.

Can't believe it got any ratings above 3 stars, but I get it that there are people who enjoy Julia Roberts enough to give anything she's in a good rating.  I like her too, but not enough to forgive dialog like this:

Liz Gilbert: I did love you, Stephen.
Stephen: I know. But I still love you.
Liz Gilbert: So, love me.
Stephen: But I miss you.
Liz Gilbert: So, miss me. Send me love and light every time you think of me... Then drop it. It won't last forever. Nothing does.

Aaughhh!!  Ladies, there are better chick flicks out there to watch with your significant other.  Do NOT expect your husbands or bf's to tolerate this movie well....clearly it's aimed at the lonely, bitter, frustrated, or disillusioned female who has no clue what they want.

The scoring, by the way, featured some great classic songs, yet it was still terrible.  The music often didn't fit what was going on, or it was blended in weird, or it chopped the sound off abruptly at a good part of the song.",1492214400,,2378,4.298206278026906

I hate to tell you but people in Italy and India are wondering the same thing. You're just filling your mind with new information which makes things exciting for a bit.

My husband  and  I  travel  together , and have  for  years.  It takes courage  to  leave the  life you know behind, and suddenly  enter a new world  of uncertainty .  Liz never wanted to  hurt her  husband  by leaving  him, but she needed to be honest  with both him and  herself  as well.

The premise of the movie - like the book-  is great and it had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it fell completely flat. There's no heart in this movie, the writing is campy, no depth in the characters except for their self-indulgence to the point of being whiny personalities from the first scene. It is so slooowwww moving that you can leave the room for 15 minutes to make a snack and not miss anything substantial. Generously, my husband and I lasted an hour into the movie hoping for the pivot -  but none came. Finally, we had enough and just gave up hope. If you're dying to see this movie, I would suggest waiting until it shows up on a free service so you can abandon it without guilt of having thrown a few of hard earned dollars to Amazon.

4064174,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"I really wanted to love that movie and thought it will inspire me but It didn't at all! A very pointless and meaningless movie! It tells a story of a selfish woman who had everything but she's unstable emotionally Just like a teenager who got changes in hormones and instead of her getting herself together by being busy, getting a second job or going back to school, she leaves her good husband whose only guilt is to be involved with a pathetic woman like her! She will seek another relationship with some young guy only to break his heart ... again!

My question here, do we all give Liz credit just because she's a woman? If that was a man, we'd have called him selfish, a**hole, j*rk... Oh you name it!

I'm a woman, working most of the day on my feet in a busy job..If I had an understanding, open minded husband like the one Liz had, then I won't do him like she did... She could have told him that she needs to travel but no, she divorced him instead!

""A foolish seeks happiness in the distance while a wise man grows it under his feet"".... in other words, she didn't have to travel to Italy to eat Italian food, she could have bought Italian cookbook or go to Italian restaurants. She didn't have to travel to India to practice meditation, cuz all she had to do is take some yoga classes and/or practice meditation where she is. Finally, a person does not have to travel to a different country to seek love, come on now let's use common sense! Her reasons for traveling is stupid and awkward, I would love to travel myself but NOT to eat, pray and love but to have fun, and take selfies in new places.... My second question, what would Ms Liz tells those of us who are unable to travel? Sorry, that movie may fool a teenager who don't understand life but a grown up woman with a busy job and real life, no she would be the last woman on earth having my attention",1472688000,5,1872,4.2824858757062145

4064190,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"It doesn't matter that this is not the greatest movie ever made, but it's high on my list.  Our world is in considerable need of a film like this.  The message is more profound than a cynical critic might believe.  I won't enumerate the details of the message.  Just look at it for yourself.  If you've seen it before, look again.  Please don't dismiss Julia Roberts as just a movie star doing her thing.  She's so honest and talented, you could miss her gift of herself to the film's truth.  This is also true of everyone else in the film. Everyone.  Richard Jenkins as usual hits it out of the park with his unbelievable surrender to the character. When he recalls his disappointment with himself revealing his loss of family caused by his recklessness, he made me totally believe, even though I'm a professional actor, writer and director who always knows the actor is not really the character.  Javier Bardem set aside his romantic, tough guy reputation to show us his vulnerability. He broke my heart. So did Jenkins. Credit for so much honesty among the actors must be shared by the director Ryan Murphy who established the environment for such truth telling. Of course, the original book by Elizabeth Gilbert and the film script by Murphy and Jennifer Felt were parents to this gorgeous child.  Even the ending which could be tossed away by ""sophisticated"" critics as a sappy happy ending is the heroine's reward for letting go of fear.  Not a bad lesson.  Look.  This a lovely, loving, rich film.  Aren't there more filmmakers out there - and bankrollers - who see how urgent it is for humanity - filmgoing human beings - to be lifted, reassured, inspired about the basic, underlying, overlying, spiritual facts of real life?  Is there anyone else out there who knows that films can be worthwhile and at the same time be beyond and above synthetic dramatical conflict, thrills, mayhem, anger, hatred, competition, destruction, killing?  Eat Pray Love looks at first glance like a lot of movies.  But it's not just another movie.  It's courageous, beautiful, and even entertaining.

The main conflict in this story is never resolved. The main character never grows up. Never changes. She the same awful person at the end of the book that she is in the beginning.

4064257,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"To address the reviews that said it was selfish; I believe that there are certain people who need a different, deeper, meaning in there lives. So many people, in all walks of life, get sucked into the factory-line of marriages that society seems to think you must participate in by the age of thirty. Some people (especially when married young) realize too late in the game that they followed along because it's what everybody does, because it was expected of them and not because it's what they really wanted. Yes, it's a horrible thing to realize for anyone involved but would it be fair to anyone to stay because society says you should, even though deep inside you know you were put on this earth to do other things? Isn't it worse to stay with someone and live a lie because you are afraid of what others will think or because you don't want to hurt anyone?

Not only does this story show how someone went against the grain, but it was an inspiration to those of us who seek more, to not be afraid of not fitting into the mold in which we think we must fit. It shows strength and courage to deeply love ourselves and to FINALLY put ourselves first before trying to meet the expectations of everyone else.",1465257600,,1209,4.445945945945946

4064295,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Although I never read the book on which it's based (my wife did), I felt this film suffered from a weak screenplay and weak preparation by Julia Roberts as the main character.  Javier Bardem and Richard Jenkins salvage the film, fairly late into it, with moving performances in supporting roles.

Julia Roberts's acting in this film was not as good as in other productions in which she has starred. It was as though she did not prepare for the role of embodying Liz Gilbert's character - perhaps she only read the weak screen adaptation and not the original book which I am assured by others established the main character and her situation better than the film.

The biggest weakness in the screenplay was that it failed to establish the main premise of the story - how Liz Gilbert had lost her sense of self every time she entered a romantic relationships - by showing, opting instead to convey that critical theme through the main character stating it as cold bare fact. Compounding this weakness was a severe lack of character development in either Liz's ex-husband Stephen, played by Billy Crudup, or even more so, in her first post-marriage boyfriend David, played by James Franco.

This was nevertheless an entertaining film, including some great foodie sequences (although I have to believe Italy offers more to eat than amazing pasta), and was ultimately rescued by the moving performances of Javier Bardem as Bali-based love interest Filipe, and Richard Jenkins as the painfully broken spiritualism seeker Liz encounters (and whose verbal insults she inexplicably tolerates) at a meditation retreat in India.",1461974400,,1618,5.026119402985074

All American women go to therapists to discuss their bad relationships with weak American men.  Americans cannot find spiritual fulfillment in the U.S. so they must divorce their spouses and go globe trotting to poor countries where people are so much more real and in touch with what it means to be human.  Are you rolling your eyes yet?  It's okay for Americans to be spiritual as long as that doesn't involve traditional religions like Christianity.  There is a conversation about teachers in the U.S. - all the schools in the U.S. have gotten rid of art and music programs.  If they do have these programs, the art and music teachers must work for free!!!  Wow, how much influence did the teacher's unions have on the writers for that one? Marriage vows are unimportant to modern American women.  If American women are unhappy in their marriage, they should pack up and leave their broken-hearted husbands behind.  Then they should subsequently leave broken-hearted boyfriends behind because there will always be another gorgeous hunk right around the corner, that is if you are tall enough and skinny enough. Americans are really, really screwed up by capitalism and hard work, but they might have a chance for redemption if they go to enough gurus in the third world.  Ok, Hollywood, blah, blah, blah, yawn, yawn.  I can only enjoy looking a Julia Robert's big, toothy smile for so long!",1458432000,,1522,4.875486381322958

It is a journey to self-realization, which I typically dislike (I believe that we, as individual, are capable to a similar journey if we take it, thus, we each should have our ""journey to self"" story).  But in the end, I admire the author/heroine's embrace of the condition or the culture of the place she was in.  Although there is bad in everything (as the world is imperfect), the author/heroine manages to see the beauty of the place, the people, the sounds, etc.",1456531200,,604,4.463636363636364

She leaves her husband because suddenly she needs to find herself or ""what to do"" but moves in with this guy she barely knows and then decides to go travel the world I do not know what for, apparently she had endless amount of money to do so. First goes to Italy where she quickly finds friends who turn out to be good people (that she just met). Then goes to the misery of India, to find herself and meditate. I do not understand Why she has to find herself in another country in the third world? and Why meditation is supposed to be the solution?. Then she goes to Bali, again to meet with some guru that has never even traveled and probably has no education. There in Bali, she is lucky again to find another good man that she spends two weeks with and at the end of the movie she stays with. Is that the message? That we have to find ourselves in a remote country and meet a man there and stay there? This movie did not make any sense to me.

4064405,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"This movie was pretty terrible.  I only gave it 2 stars because I like Julia Roberts & James Franco, but it's a pity they did this movie.  I have NOT read the book, but presumably it goes a bit deeper than the movie - one would hope, anyway, because the movie is a rather superficial summary of a life, wannabe spirituality, introspection, and love.

This movie and story is not really feminist, as one may want to believe.  It's just a seemingly spoiled woman who needs to convince herself it's ok to go enjoy stuff more and spend a lot of money on herself. Like - A LOT.  And apparently that was the key to her supposed 'enlightenment.'  I'm a middle-class white woman in NYC, so I'm not too far from understanding where she's coming from.  I understand for women it can be difficult to feel justified in giving yourself some time, attention, and love, and not feel like your selfish doing it, and it's totally legitimate for that to be part of your journey...however...this movie didn't capture the spirit of that true struggle for me at all.  And if she was supposed to have evolved throughout this to have gained more empathy for other people, they didn't do the best job at portraying that in a meaningful way, they just skimmed the surface of it.

The movie gives NO real back story, and doesn't go too deep into her psyche to understand why she is apparently suffering so much.  So, I basically developed ZERO empathy for her.  I didn't care about her 'quest' in any way, and it didn't seem to be that important.  We're all entitled to our experiences, and our feelings, but we shouldn't all be writing books and making movies about them...and then taking other people's money for them...(even if it was only the $2.99 for the SD version...I want my money back.)

Oh, you just can't seem to stay single for last 20 years?  You just can't stop having these pretty decent relationships that maybe aren't perfect but are with decent men?  Cry me a river.  What a nice problem to have.  And all this means you just haven't been able to spend time with yourself?  That's it?  Really?  Ok, then spend some time with yourself.  Oh wait - you have to completely change your life, go across the globe and spend thousands and thousands of dollars doing it, at some superficial attempt at enlightenment?  Oh cool.  Got it.

And then, when you've finally decided to know yourself better and find balance and various things that make you happy (yeah, hanging out in Bali partying and biking and chilling with your guru must be pretty hard introspective work!), then, and ONLY THEN can you learn the valuable lesson that it's ok to shirk all your ""balance"" and whatever else you care about to go spend MORE time with the new man you love (who you already hung out with for 2 weeks non-stop).  Oh yeah.  That's enlightenment.  Yes, getting a bit carried away with new love is totally legitimate. But to basically exalt this and tell yourself that it's ok to forget temporarily about all the things that got you supposedly ""centered"" in the first place kind of ruins that legitimacy.  Isn't that what she was running from in the first place?  That she was losing herself in someone else?",1451692800,2,3179,4.576991150442478

As great an actress as Julia Roberts is, she was not the right person for this role; a young Meryl Streep would have been more believable.  Liz Gilbert's personality in the book is bold and self-centered but was played by an actress who had to downplay her own bold, self-centered personality to become a self-pitying victim of her own misguided choices who had the fortune to travel to far off places to heal the pain of love gone awry.  The scenery was very realistic but maybe too realistic for a movie.  Less busy atmospheres with a calming effect would have made a greater impact but instead crowded the viewer's capacity to think.  On the bright side, the love interest and the guru were the highlights.",1446336000,,867,4.603896103896104

The author was not self absorbed or frivolous, but trying to find her place in this chaotic world and her purpose in life in order to live as a better human being. The book goes deeper into this but the Hollywood version isn't so bad. You just need to know this is not a comedy romance, although it is fun and there is romance.

4064576,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"I heard everyone recommends the book more and was impressed with the book.
After completing reading, I wasn't disappointed with the movie either - the characters were mostly along with my images (I could see Liz in Julia Roberts) and I can see some nice twists the movie made as well (was also impressed about the contrast of Edward and Felipe as one lost his son and the other kept his). Overall, although I didn't agree with the hectic towards the ending as it was too Hollywoody, it makes you feel like journeying through the book's world with Liz, of the more visualized version with beautiful sceneries and each person's accents as they speak. Great job that they made all this realized with perfect casting and filming!
Yet still, you ought to read the book to understand what's the whole story is about and relates more to your inner spirit - 2 hours and 20 mins is too short to describe everything, after all. Lastly, I really wished the movie would feature Yudhi, the Indonesian musician who was deported from America  in the book, or at least his music so that he could be famous and one day go back to his loving NYC again.",1430870400,7,1134,4.53170731707317

It is based on a true story, that gives me hope that someday I too can break free of ""chains"" that hold me back from my life ambitions and goals and that I will achieve my dreams and goals as well.

4064609,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"Shallow and completely non-spiritual.  A perfect example of priv-lit egocentrism that gives true spirituality a bad name. This movie utterly repulsed me.  Why you ask?  Well try imagining it from the husband's perspective. If you do a little research you'll discover that while Ms. Gilbert was discovering her ""true self,"" the husband she left was destroyed. To cope with his loss he immersed himself in actual humanitarian work...work that he had been doing for many years mind you. Could you imagine being dumped by your wife and then having her side of the story become a best seller - making her a millionaire!?  It would be as if the whole world agreed with her decision to divorce you.  Even worse - you get to watch her ""struggle"" with her decision to leave you on screen and hear her tell you to send her ""light and love"" in order to get over her.  Really?  That's what you got out of your trip to India?  And as if that wasn't enough, in the end you get to watch her ""fall in love"" with a dreamy Brazilian man - the capstone event of her enlightening year abroad.  So what's the moral of the story?  She ""learned to love again.""  Wow - I think I just threw up a little in my mouth.  So there you have it. If you wake up one day and find that the passion in your marriage is gone don't worry.

A glorified cougar film. She's what, 50 years old in this movie, and has no desire for children, or anything but her own personal fulfillment. More Hollywood Blasphemy.

 This as you know is a true story and when you read the amazing book Elizabeth comes off as quite humbled in the beginning because of a broken marriage and terrible divorce and decides to do an extended overseas travel starting in Italy.  Well in Italy Julia, still is Julia, and I really don't feel Elizabeths presence, Julia comes off as way too confident, (well Julia was 11 years Elizabeths senior) .  I wish they had an unknown actress play this role.
The movie is beautiful however felt rushed.

The next big taboo is that the character Felipe (in real life Jose) is suppose to be 17 years her senior!  But the actor Javier is one year younger then Julia!  How could they cast this?!! !  Nothing like the book, but if you watch it just as the movie is is a good movie.  Not 5 stars but good.

There were some amazing quotes to live by and who doesn't like Julia Roberts?  It made me extremely hungry.  The cinematography when it came to the food, was incredible.

Knowing that any movie about a book can merely be but I simple interpretation I really enjoyed the movie. People bashed it but I believe it's because they had expectations instead of going into the movie with an open mind knowing the movie is just about entertainment.

Read the book first and found it a very reflective , slow-moving story of basically a woman's quest for finding herself and living authentically.  Through lots of trials and errors, the main character travels literally around the world to awaken her inner muses that include an interwoven comedic story of food, romance and passion.  Very touching and well acted by Julia Roberts. The scenes are lush and reflect appropriately the rich details and descriptions found in the book.  Can be somewhat woo woo at times, but overall an amazing journey for those struggling with self identification, seeking passion and authenticity.",1404000000,,684,5.2

So many people have said that this movie is boring, but I disagree.  I think that everyone nowadays scoffs at anything remotely spiritual and I think it is horribly sad.  This movie is all about finding yourself again when you have lost yourself so completely in another person that you don't know who you are.  Yes, she had a lot of money and could just drop her life and go on an adventure, but who doesn't fantasize about that?  This movie showed me that it is possible to get yourself out of a situation you are drowning in and you don't have to live in misery.

Being at a point in my life when I have suffered multiple losses including the loss of my son and then my mother to cancer, I was also questioning many things spiritually in my life.  This movie has helped me gain an understanding of why or at least how to deal with the things that life has handed me and to grow from them.  I am thinking of writing my own book and calling it ""Grieve, Grow, Go"" with a nod to Liz Gilbert.

The movie was a huge let down and seemed like they were trying to cram the book into an hour and a half (or however long it was).

4064881,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"I borrowed this movie from a local library after hearing so many good comments about it. Perhaps we watched different movies, because I was was rather disappointed.

The story revolves around Liz, a woman who visits a medicine man that reads her palm and tells her about the future. She decides to take his information to heart and begins making major changes in her life based on this knowledge. She begins by divorcing her husband, a man with lots of ambition but lacks focus. She finds comfort in the arms of a younger stage actor but shortly after realizes it was more of a rebound relationship than anything.

In an attempt to figure out her priorities, she decides to take a year long trip through various locations hoping to find whatever it is she is missing. Her travels begin in Italy where she happens upon an English speaking Swedish woman at a local coffee shop. The two of them become friends and her social network in Italy begins expanding. Here she learns that sometimes doing nothing is alright, which is probably the best advice in the whole movie.

Next she moves on to India to visit a spirtual leader she became interested in while dating the actor/yoga instructor. This seemed rather odd because it seemed like she wasn't all that interested in the leader while dating her boyfriend, so why would she travel around the world to attend her retreat in a different country? Here she is able to forgive herself for the divorce and any other wrongdoings in her life.

The final locale is Bali where she reunites with the medicine man from the beginning and becomes his temporary assistant. He teaches her to find her balance in life, but ultimately tells her to forget the balance if she can find a love strong enough.

Maybe the book is better because it can dwell more on tiny details and personal reflections. The movie, however, came across as a woman who had a pretty good life (successful author, large circle of friends, and a caring husband) who decides she wants more/something different. It seemed very much like a man's mid-life crisis taken to the extreme. At least with a mid-life crisis you might buy an expensive car or ""toy"", but Liz decides to leave everyone she loves behind in order to go on a self imposed mission to discover herself mentally and spiritually. For the average person this type of ""retreat"" would not be monetarily obtainable, but due to her success she is able to shirk all obligations for an entire year.",1383350400,,2459,4.68287037037037

The book includes more thoughtful insights from the author in a way that the movie format makes more difficult to provide.

4064914,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"This movie is BRILLIANT. It was exactly what I needed when it first came out, and it still is.

Ignore the bad reviews; people judge things they don't understand. This is not a romantic comedy, so while it can be funny and romantic, that is not its purpose. It's the hero's journey from myth, but with a female hero.

Nonattachment and choosing your own thoughts, subjects covered during her trip to India, are the key to happiness and are being taught in every spiritual discipline. Nonattachment is what spiritual teachers are teaching students right now. It's ironic in the best way that the attachment she ultimately had a hardest time giving up was her new dedication to nonattachment! She was terrified of wanting something again, and making a commitment.

She is not selfish for choosing the life she wants. As women we're taught that we're bad people if we don't dance to everyone else's tune. I thought it was the bolder choice doing what they did, maintaining the first husband's personality from the book, and making him not a bad guy. It was no one's fault, it just wasn't working.

I've been in her position, praying for something, anything, a way up off the floor. And education is almost always the answer. Yes, the fact that the character seemed to have a lot of money made her trips a lot easier but that's not a reason to be completely prejudiced against her. Starting with physical indulgence in Rome, exploring the power of pleasure, then turning completely spartan in India and concentrating only on the spirit, she had to find out if it was possible to do both -- to live in the modern world, enjoy herself, and maintain the spiritual life she needed. She got both, and the right man, in Bali.

This movie is perfect for anyone having hard times, someone exploring spirituality, especially meditation, Eastern religions, or simply anyone who really wants to travel. It hit me on all fronts. Watch it if you want to know more about having a larger life.",1373673600,35,1974,4.7101449275362315

4064927,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"I wish this movie was better. You could only hope that a movie with such actors would be reasonably entertaining, amusing and/or likable. Unfortunately, the movie is not engaging and we frequently found ourselves asking ""What?"" and ""Why""? When I learned that this movie was first a book, I realized its one of those movies that attempts to follow the book's storyline to a fault -- probably not satisfying fans of the book and leaving other viewers feeling like they missed something.  Probably the most disappointing aspect is that the main characters give you little reason to ""root for them"" and don't really have any development. It seems like Julia Robert's character is supposed to learn something, but in the end, you wonder if she's changed at all or moved forward in any way.

And the scenery, which seems to be noted a positive aspect of this movie by other reviewers, is nice, but given the material, and what other movies have done with the same settings, is boring. Poor cinematography?

This movie gets a single star, not because its the worst movie ever made (it isn't), but because it falls so short of modest expectations of entertainment and the potential (source material, actors, budget, etc.) for a good movie.",1372291200,3,1231,4.852380952380952

I think Julia Roberts is a great actress, and have loved everything I've seen her in.  But, I guess this movie never got much attention, or maybe the name wasn't something that attracted movie goers to see it.  I can honestly say it was a wonderful heartfelt movie about a woman, who after a bad time in her life, went on a journey to find inner peace.  The countries she visited had some beautiful scenery and lots of adventure, and there were so many wonderful surprises in store for her during her journey.  I understand it was a movie based on a true story, and I just had to have the dvd so I could watch it again from the beginning.  What a ""Happy Surprise"" this movie turned out to be.

I chose the DVD because it is the most portable for all players in the household. The choices were either DVD or Blu-ray; no Blu-ray combo packs, Ultraviolet, or digital copies, therefore we had to go with the lowest common denominator for all player types from laptops to dedicated players.
The DVD does include both the theatrical version and the unrated director's cut, so this is at least some consolation. However, in this day of 'play anywhere anytime', this product does not measure up, even though it is priced the same as those that do provide more portability.",1365379200,,644,4.707964601769912

Overall, it simplified and romanticized a book that is deep and profound. It striped it of everything I loved; it was a completely different experience. Neither my boyfriend nor I enjoy chick flicks, and so neither of us liked this movie. (I wouldn't consider the book to be a 'chick-lit"".)

I will say that I loved the photography and use of light throughout this movie, that was beautiful. (Also, you should watch it after you eat because the Italy scenes will make you hungry.)

I recommend reading the book before watching the movie.

Liz is not selfish- she is the opposite of selfish, she is brave and true to herself.

4065022,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"So, I read the book (HATED IT) and couldn't get over how self-centered and awful the main character was.  Obviously, I was missing some big profound message or inspiration that has affected so many fans out there.  I just couldn't get past the fact that this woman was someone I did not like, that I would never be friends with, that I have absolutely no respect for!  That she was in Italy discovering a healthy relationship with food was preposterous!  Her story was vacuous and self-indulgent, and not really a story at all.  As for the interpretation of the movie, I hoped to find something that I missed in the book.  It was beautifully filmed but again, the character came across as ridiculous to me.  I like Julia Roberts and she did a decent job (I've seen her do better but this wasn't much of a role to sink anyone's teeth into).  I love Jarvier Bardem (LOVE) and he was a highlight for me... it's nice to see him in a vulnerable, romantic role rather than the villains that he's known for.

4065077,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"The view is beautiful, and it's not just Julia Roberts we're looking at; EPL is likely the best looking movie you'll see all year. Of course it helps to have Italy and Indonesia as exotic backdrops, but the art of cinematography should never be underestimated and it's really first class here; I'd go to Bali in a heartbeat, it looked that good.

If Julia Roberts went on a spiritual odyssey it might look a lot like EPL. OK, so we all know she's married with twins and gives every indication that she's happy with her lot, but it's actually not as far fetched a notion as it might seem. Apparently she found something to her liking in India whilst filming and embraced Hinduism on her return to New Mexico. Nice though that is, it's really the main problem with the movie.

The first time I heard someone call her Liz, as in Liz Gilbert, the real life protagonist on whose book the screenplay and movie are based, it was really grating. Towards the end it became less noticeable as she disappeared more into the role, but not much. I can't decide if she was miscast, or whether she was simply a necessity given the star wattage needed to make such an internally referenced movie.

Whilst the book is a chatty affair, a funny, self regalatory dialogue between reader and writer, a bit like listening in on an extended conversation between girlfriends, the movie usually side steps any effort to visually translate this and resorts to extensive use of voice-over. Perhaps a lesser star would have been more capable of disappearing into the role and carrying the weight of the emotional and spiritual journey. I'm not sure why but Naomi Watts keeps coming into my head as I think about it; from an acting point of view someone like her might been a better choice for the role because she has such a talent for raw emotion and for portraying neurotic and needy.

Having read the book a couple of times and got a lot from it, I had high hopes for the movie, but after reading a spate of poor reviews I realized I would have to downgrade my expectations. What really surprised me was how negative some of the reviews were; some reviewers really hated the movie and these were reviewers whose opinions I normally seek out and respect. They viewed Liz Gilbert as selfish and self indulgent in the extreme and whilst they may have a point, I think the problem was that they hadn't read the book. Lacking the time to really delve into the reasons for her journey, the movie portrays her as very self seeking in her treatment of the men she left behind. For this reason I almost felt it would have been better to simply launch her straight into the Italian section of her journey and fill in the missing motivation and back story as necessary.

Apparently the director and co-writer Ryan Murphy consulted with Elizabeth Gilbert on the screenplay and as a result was able to include material not in the book, even as he had to leave much out. This led to incidents like one just before the movie ends where Julia (sorry, Liz) breaks off her relationship with her Brazilian amour Felipe because she fears it will undermine everything she has sought during her year of exploration, namely balance. Whether this actually happened seemed beside the point; it seemed true to the spirit of her journey and I wished more liberties had been taken in an attempt to get to the heart of the story. With a distinct lack of such resonant moments the movie usually seemed more interested in outer beauty than in portraying her struggle for inner peace.

It's a well accepted truism that books and movies are apples and oranges; the movie of a book has to stand alone as a complete entity in itself and this usually means staying true to the spine of the book but substantially reinventing how that is portrayed in this most visual of mediums. It seemed to me the movie lacked the confidence to do this, probably as it didn't want to offend the book's many fans.

Having said all that I'm sure the movie will do well, even if it never expands its audience beyond the 8 million readers who bought the book. But whilst the book led to legions of devoted Liz followers (known by some as Lizbians) and touched a nerve somewhere deep in the psyche of many middle aged women seeking reinvention, the movie leaves its audience with nothing of substance. It was probably too much to hope that it would, but it's sad nevertheless that a book that held such meaning for so many should be reduced to nothing more than a 2 hour diversion in a movie theater.",1348963200,,4519,4.551045510455104

Yet, I did not find her very sympathetic and as I was in theatre I regularly found myself hoping she would fall down a flight of stairs, but alas, she never does. Maybe in the sequel?

I hope Julia realizes that as she loses her looks even more and her box office draw continues on its downward trend she might have to take a hard look in the mirror, mirror and realize she's not the pretty woman we all thought she was. (LOL, right? I just thought that one up on the spot).

Anyway, I have a cousin name a Rimmy Jo Buckles who claims to have messed around with her husband Eric Roberts when she was in Georgia in the 80s but Rimmy is a notorious liar, so who knows.

4065084,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"This is a woman's unique journey of learning how to love out of generosity, not sacrifice.

Gilbert, like so many young American women, commit themselves too early to a direction/relationship in life. After all she grew up in a very traditional, middle class, mid-western family (who often define happiness as a traditional marriage and planted lifestyle in your 20s). And she held onto to this life for a long time, because like all women, she didn't want to hurt anyone. But many young American women need to figure out who they are before committing to a husband and a life. This takes time and emotional maturity many women are taught to believe they do not have.

Why? Building a life not based on your unique passions and understanding of the kind of husband who is right for you is frankly...wrong.  This means you will spend your life loving others by giving from your root and not your fruit. And in the long run, yes it hurts us, but it ALWAYS HURTS OUR LOVED ONES.

Gilbert married into the wrong relationship for her. She couldn't accept him as he was. She was dependent on him being someone he wasn't.  When we don't feel good about ourselves and our lives, we struggle to love others well. ""Do you feel my love for you?"" as Elizabeth said. So by the time most women hit their 30s, they realize living a life where you're tolerating misery isn't good for anyone.

Truly loving people means there are no strings attached...because believe in the authenticity of our love for them BASED ON HOW WE LOVE OURSELVES. When we are content and at peace with ourselves, then we can really GIVE to others without NEEDING back from them.  That's how our love empowers others...which is the greatest way to live.

But to change your life so you give from your fruit and not your root is often a MESS.  But Gilbert had the courage to do it.  If she had not let her husband go, he wouldn't have had the chance to make a happier life. What a risky, loving, and brave thing to do.

So I find the principles in Eat Pray Love incredibly relateable to every woman who decides to un-compromise her life for the sake of making the world a better place.",1346457600,9,2143,4.497422680412371

SPOILERS:

I'm not sure if Julia Roberts' character simply chose the wrong person to marry or really didn't want to be married to anyone, but thought she had to be. She's a career woman, who finds it beneath her to have children, which should have been discussed with her fiance before marriage. She should have told him she didn't want to have kids, which was one reason she filed for divorce.

She also was upset that her husband wanted some home-cooked meals. Again, if she hated cooking, she should have told him before getting married to him, such as, ""I hate cooking, so if you want a home-cooked meal, be prepared to do it yourself."" Cooking is a responsibility that can be shared as well, but she felt it necessary to divorce over that issue too.

Then she decides everything is about her and what she wants, never mind what her husband wants. But he's not entirely innocent either, because she talks, and he doesn't listen. Both of them needed to sit down and discuss what they wanted out of life and what they wanted from each other before getting married.

So to make herself feel better she travels, meets people, and gets happy. Who wouldn't be happier after spending a year's long vacation without worrying about the cost?",1343001600,2,1476,4.639846743295019

4065093,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Eat, Pray, Love is a true story about a writer who leaves her husband because she's overcome with the feeling that her life doesn't fit and isn't a real reflection of herself. She seeks escape in a younger man, doesn't find it, then decides that she may have better luck by doing a yearlong adventure in Italy, India, and Indonesia. Through those adventures she finds love and happiness again.

I have mixed feelings about the movie. I read the book and felt it was a self-indulgent pity party. I didn't expect much from the movie, but wanted to give it a chance.

CONS:
Julia Roberts is horrible. I am not a Roberts fan, but seeing her in this was agony. I am so over her. She can't act. Period. She is the same in everything. Was this Erin Brockovich Goes to Italy or Julianne Porter (from My Best Friend's Wedding) Shacks Up? She looked depressed most of the time. When she lit up, it was a huge contrast, but that rarely happened. The only way I knew that she had transformed into a happy person was when the Balinese man (Ketut) said so.

The pace was REALLY fast. I knew that there had to be a lot left out in order to cover adventures in three countries and give it a set up as well, but this was lightning speed. It didn't give a chance to really get the flavor of each location or how she was changed by the experiences there. We are just given dialog that tells us what happened. The segues from place to place were abrupt too.

The ah ha! moments didn't translate to film. The first one was, ""Go to bed, Liz."" That wasn't illuminating to me in the book either, but I could see how she thought it was. In the film, it was as if God was not listening to her. All of the big turning points in the book were lost in the movie.

It's unrelatable. It feels like a fantasy. ""Normal"" people just don't cry over nothing, run off for a year, forget all their friends, and come back happy. I think that is the big message of the movie and that falls flat...unless that is your fantasy.

PROS:
Despite all I just said, I actually ""got"" that her inner/outer journey was transformative. Maybe that was because I read the book. Maybe it's because I lead sacred travel tours and have experienced that same growth myself. Some of the things that may have seemed trite and New Age resonated with me. (Maybe because I'm trite and New Age? lol)

The scenery was the big winner. As a world traveler myself, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE seeing new places. The locations weren't just shot as background. They were characters in the movie! That was very effectively done. Of the three locations, I have only been to Rome, but it IS everything you see and more!

I hate when people can't review a product for what it is instead of comparing it to the book because often, I haven't read the book. Sorry for doing that to you. If you haven't read the book and are wondering whether to try it out, my advice is, if you like Roberts, the Hollywood formula and exotic locales, you will probably like it. If you want meaning, logic and good acting, forget it. :)",1340755200,4,3032,4.3350970017636685

There are a few problems with this story (love it or hate it); but at the end of the day, it's a one woman's journey. Everyone is different.

Javier was fun to watch (and sexy, as always) but I'm not sure Julia Roberts was the rights cast for this character. She seemed too cold and distant; I didn't really see the chemistry between them.

But, I enjoyed the locations, the cinematography was superb, and it inspired me to travel more (and that's good) . . . I'm going to Italy this summer.

I think the story is about taking a stand for you own life. Do the things you need to do. This, to me is an important message women need to hear more often.

4065103,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"This excellent movie begins as the Roberts character's life is falling apart after divorce so much so that she can not even enjoy the things she previously enjoyed food and love,and can not even be comforted by a teacher(being under the influence of teachers gurus or a theme here). This type of story was made in the 40's and later remade by bill murray(one of the best of modern comics)as Razor's edge(somerset maugham). This is  a different story based on a new book. The divorce shows the man looking for traditional values,stability,where as the woman flighty,seems to move among many relationships, a very commom feature of modern culture,normalized,as the animating romantic figures as our mind are looked for on the outside world rather than the other way around,or as the movie shows in terms of values. So where off to Italy,to a home with little running water,and none of the comforts science has brought to modern life,from here on the lack of typical comforts are important and the character muses in
anger 'jesus' as if in shock. She also changes perspectives,she is shown around an italian home situation, and around the city of naples,and the values are
'experienced' not authorized by the men,a theme in this movie. This is a similar theme of a man looking for values and stability in her earler film
mystic pizza. we also hear a great man,someone to look for,is someone who cares for children,but she also comments on the many good women shes talked too.
Then where off to India the land of 'bagavad giya.' Here we are seen the value of service in this religious culture,however it was in the west as well but never really taught. She feels disconnected..a texan who is briefly on the scene tells her you must master your mind...she has control isues...unspiritual and to the religious 'sick.' A typical modern man..Jesus' sermons can always be seen in this kind of controlling person. Using everyone for theor own ends....she needs to be transformed however she does get married...then off to bali single again...she meets a brazilian...i guess showing an american in
relation to people from different backgrounds. She doesnt want a husband...but healing,like the old shamans can perform. She is injured..bloody...and gets a medicine person offering this kind of service. She meets a brazilian who
represents the old portugueese,the wisdom of the west who was too disposed of
after caring for children,they both seek enlightenment a catch phrase in the west where after the decline of religion a new life was opening up...but here in its reverse format saving them from what science has brought the modern
world...the story ends showing her as someone who lost her balance in wayward
society and learning through traditional religion of east and west and finding wholeness and help...and she learns all  ""given my experience""...and the film ends on a boat trip a phallic symbol of love...

Julia roberts has brought a really grown up story to the screen and she really plays the role great! We are interested in her personal story and the tale is not lost in its myriad locations as we develop greater interest in her as the tale moves on...and we see the changes in the story.

The film is beautifully shot but seems to lack the heart and soul and emotional depth we chick flick types look for.  The movie isn't a total failure however.

You can fast-forward the first 29 minutes or so as it's all slow back story. I did not and now I'll never get those 29 minutes of my life back.

Now once Ms. Roberts lands in Italy the movie starts to come to life. The friends she makes in Italy and the scenarios involving food, gestures, joining soccer fans in Napoli and exploring Rome make for a fantastic movie. That movie I wanted to see.

Sadly, as soon as that gets started it's over and off to India. Landing in India we get that helter skelter taxi cab ride through the bizarre culture shock that is the Asian subcontinent. Then the movie reverts back to slow as molasses boredom in an ashram. Sorry, I just cannot handle navel-gazing hippy nonsense. That whole section of the flick I did fast-forward.

Then onto Bali where the story of Julia's journey actually started in the ""fillum."" There it's pretty much hit and more miss as Javier No Country and her start a romance that is fine for what it is but involves way too much neurosis on Julia's part.

So I'd say overall Eat is excellent, Pray is hideous and Love is just mediocre. Personally, I would have liked to have dumped Julia and stayed in Rome to follow her close friends--the Swedish woman and her Italian boyfriend. Now they were an infinitely more interesting couple than No Country for Bali and Erin Bali-no-vich.

Julia Roberts does an admirable job portraying a self-involved woman who clearly only thinks of herself.  She does show some personal growth in her year of finding herself, but ultimately, the movie left me with kind of a blah feeling, like I wanted more positive change in our protagonist (I realize this is a true story).

My wife loved the book and film, and as a middle-aged male, I suspect I wasn't the demographic they were interested in anyway when marketing this film, as I only watched it with my wife as a personal favor.  So, it could have been worse, but I clearly do not recommend watching this film if you are a middle-aged male, unless you want to keep the better half happy that you can actually stop watching the gosh-darned sports for a couple of hours and share a gosh-darn film that she actually wants to see, (for once).",1313539200,3,1031,4.410526315789474

4065134,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Much has been said about this movie not being nearly as good as the book, and that is all nonsense.  The book is a monologue and since when have you gone to the cinema to see a movie with almost no dialogue, just one person talking?  Would you really want to watch a woman in the midst of a nervous breakdown, constantly screaming and weeping, all ""ME ME ME, WHY ME""?  Most folks would not, and would say she needed to get her act together, which is what the book is about.  The movie hardly mentions that part.  Some books, like ""Room With A View"" make it to the screen almost entirely intact and watching the (Merchant Ivory) movie is like seeing the beloved book brought to life.  Other books, like ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" end up with a movie that bears no resemblance to the book, because the book wasn't that good to begin with.  ""Eat Pray Love"" is something else.  Bits and pieces of the book are cherry picked and a movie was made, with characters invented to give a home to parts of the monologue now repurposed as dialogue.  Almost nothing in the movie happens in the way it was written in the book, but we get an entertaining romantic comedy with some spiritual mumbo-jumbo, and without all the gut wrenching self loathing, and mental melt down.

We also get some fairly gorgeous cinematography, particularly in the Italy and Bali sections.

Unfortunately, it seems that quite a bit of the film ended up on the editing room floor which makes some parts of the film seem like they need a bit more explaining, something that is far more clear if you've read the book, but not essential to the enjoyment of this film.

I have now enjoyed the book, and will still enjoy the movie as I found it, a romantic comedy/a ""chick flick"".  To all those who are hysterical that we didn't get a film about a neurotic, screaming, control freak alternately discovering the pleasures of the world and how to actually live in it I say, Bah.

This was the reason movies were more or less invented, to divert people's attention from the woes and horrors of everything going on during the Depression and WW II. Today there are plenty of problems in America that make a movie like this one great entertainment, for me at least, to get away from tornadoes, forest fires, drought, floods and unemployment, to name a few.

I laughed a lot at the predicament of trying to learn a new language (Italy) and customs of India. Right away I am in Amazon looking up the movie to buy. Who cares about the deep under currents and subplots. I am 72 and I want entertainment. I laughed and I cried.

The interesting spiritual stuff is gone, even the food parts are uninteresting. I don't really buy the love story at all. This movie has some elements of the book, sure, but none of the depth.

I hesitated to watch this. It was on Netflix, so I figured I'd give it a go, since I don't have to pay any more for it. Yeah, bad idea. For gutting the story like it did, it was way too long. The scenery wasn't as cool as it should have been, and the characters other than Gilbert were not explored at all, let alone as deeply as they were in the book.

Okay, fine, I get that's what Hollywood does. However, this was an autobiographical work. These were real people who got turned into props. Gilbert's own amazing and inspiring spiritual journey got totally pushed to the backseat. She does some emotional work in the movie, but all of the spiritual enlightenment, which is a beautiful and amazing story in and of itself, is gone.

Elizabeth Gilbert is a real person, and I just don't think she deserves to be portrayed as a shallow idiot with no introspection. Especially after she went through the spiritual work and was wonderful enough to share that with the rest of us by writing it down in her book.

Julia Roberts plays the role of a heartbroken divorced women who decides to travel to Italy, India, and Indonesia to find inner peace and balance. She goes on a 1 year journey traveling to these 3 countries searching for happiness.

I was inspired by the quote given by Ketut: ""In order to stay happy, you must always know where you are"". If you do know your place in the journey of life, you will accept everything that happens to you and will have inner peace, eventually becoming happy. I believe this could simply be done by grabbing a piece of paper and write/draw on it your journey through life. Put on it life's basic elements such as success, love, family, spirituality, health...etc. See where you are. See the big picture. See which areas you need to improve and perfect. Hang this paper somewhere in the house and look at it everyday. Keep thinking about it, and I believe this is how you could achieve inner peace and balance.

I heard people criticize this movie for being slow and sometimes boring. Well, the pace of the movie MUST be slow since its about achieving inner balance. You can't expect a fast paced movie about inner balance to be effective and received well. It has to be slow and need to take its time, just like the journey for the quest of happiness.

Good movie, I highly recommend it.",1306886400,5,1330,4.57563025210084
4065151,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"The movie was good for its entertainment value such as: beautiful scenes of italy, bali and india, her unique outfits, and just an excuse to be lazy and watch someone else travel. So overall it was nice, just not realistic.

Now for the bad part. Its sooo fake. Its like a fairytale. Here's what they try to make us believe:
1) MONEY IS OPTIONAL
She allegedly got divorced and had no money. But yet, she manages to take a trip to 3 countries and stay there for several years?? Not once did she even get a job to support herself. She stayed in pretty nice places for it to be ""free"". She even had money to take italian classes from a hot tutor.

2) DESIGNER CLOTHES
How did she have the money? How did she have the time to go shopping? I didn't see her go shopping. Her wardrobe was very nice despite the fact that she only traveled with ""one little bag"". Not realistic at all! For a girl to carry such a small bag with  barely any clothes or makeup, they would not look like julia roberts who would wake up freshly made up and with perfect boticelli curls. And we cannot forget how clean she looked while in India and Bali.

3) GIRLS ARE SO NICE AND EASY TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH
Not! In real life, girls couldn't care less about other girls. But in this movie, she makes girlfriends easily. And in all the cases, they approached her. She didn't have to do any effort. Its as if they knew she was the celebrity ""julia roberts"" even though shes ""acting"" like someone else. I'm sorry but in real life, girls are catty as can be!

4) LIFE IS PERFECT WHEN YOU TRAVEL
Nothing annoying or bad happened to her while she traveled. She wasn't mugged. She didn't really have a bad day. Things always worked out for her. That's not realistic. The only time something ""bad"" happened ended up being ""good"", like hurting her leg to meet the guy of her dreams.

5) GURUS ARE WAITING AROUND TO HELP WHITE AMERICAN GIRLS FIND THEMSELVES
Im not really sure what his intentions were. Exactly how was he benefiting from this relationship? Was he that lonely that she was his only friend? She only brought stress to the guru.

6) GAINING WEIGHT IN THE MOVIE MEANS WEIGHING 125LBS
The girl she met in Italy was complaining about gaining weight and she was so skinny. So they set out on a journey to find bigger jeans...whoa thats a great story. If that girl is fat, then I must be obese. I was laughing out loud when they were both in the dressing room trying to close her size 4 jeans on her obviously tiny body. It was sooo ridiculous because the jeans obviously fit her tiny ass. But they kept acting like she was the girl in the movie ""Precious"".

7) MEN ARE LINING UP
For us normal looking folk, men don't just appear the way they appear in this movie. If i  went to a crowded play, i certainly would not catch the eye of the lead character. 1) because its crowded 2) because i don't look like julia roberts
This movie is just an insight on what its like to be beautifully attractive.

8) WHAT THE HELL WAS SHE LOOKING FOR? DID SHE EVEN FIND IT?
I still don't know what she wanted in the first place. I mean, i just thought she wanted a long vacation. But isn't that what everyone wants? We just don't have the money like she did. She claimed she wanted peace. But how exactly? In the form of a man? I thought the movie would be a little deeper than that. I think she was just bored the whole time.

9) POOR LIZ, HER LIFE WAS SO AWFUL BEFORE THE TRIP!
They didn't convince me that her life was so bad before
She was in a mansion, friends, her cute husband, what was the problem? Well, they didn't really show it if there was one. If it was an issue of editing, there were many other parts of the movie that i would have sacrificed so that they could add a scene about why she hated her life so much.

10) LIZ WAS VERY RESPONSIBLE TO LEAVER HER MARRIAGE OF 8 YEARS SO ABRUPTLY
I wonder if she even had a heartbeat. She didn't give him a chance to fix it. And she left halfway around the world. I don't think he was that bad. She acted like he abused her or something.

11) SHE'S NOT INDEPENDENT, BUT SHE THINKS SHE IS.....
Yeah, she did make the trip halfway around the world, BUT, she only makes decisions based on the guru/medicine healer's opinion. In the end, she has no mind of her own.

12) LACK OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
james franco (david), richard and her husband didn't really have good character development. They all just disappear into the void.
13) How did Felipe fall in love with her so fast?
They barely just met. I can't figure this one out. Was it because felipes son told his dad that its time he have sex again?

14) POOR & MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS CAN'T HAVE ENLIGHTENMENT
Why? Because we don't have the money to take years off our jobs and go to 3 countries and go on vacation.
15) The guru/medicine healer really needed subtitles. I tried hard to understand a word he said.

16) THE TITLE OF THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ""SELFISH AROUND THE WORLD""
Liz is selfish, not because she is trying to find herself but because of the way she is with other people in this movie. She doesn't think of others while she is trying to find herself. They tried to make her seem so nice by giving the house to the family, but that was the only nice gesture. She didn't care about anyone else 's feelings.

HERE'S WHAT THE MOVIE HAS TO OFFER:
1)A scenic break from our mundane lives that last about 2 hours.
2)It will make you think its time to go on vacation.
3)Will make you want to cook or eat italian food
4)Its fun to make fun of this unrealistic movie

4065156,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"I have so many issues with this film I'm almost hesitant to even write this review, since I don't really know how to start it.  I mean, what is there to say that wouldn't sound like a random checklist of insults to the film?

Maybe I should start with a synopsis.

Based on the memoirs of Elizabeth Gilbert, a young woman who abandoned her marriage and her `life as she knew it' for a lesson in self-discovery by scouring the globe in search of meaning in her life.  She went to Rome, India and Bali.  She ate, with little regard for her waistline.  She meditated with mixed results and she fell in love for the second (and longest) time.

Sadly, that is kind of all there is here.  The film doesn't dig into the meat of Liz well enough to create something more than superficial.  Even the basis for her divorce seems selfish and underdeveloped.  I understand that she and her husband were `different people' but that is the case in every relationship and Liz came across as a selfish and stubborn woman who was tired of not getting everything she wanted, despite not fully knowing what it was that she wanted.  The places she goes are beautiful and the food she eats looks scrumptious, but there is no weight added to her actions.  She seems one-note, desperate for something but not fully aware of what that something is.  And her revelations come about in a way that breathes a lot of contradiction into the film; for the message seems unevenly toned.  Her adventures lack depth and development and give the air of pointless pandering, failing to emotionally connect to the audience.  And then there are sequences and plot lines that defy all logic.  Normally one would have to suspend disbelief with cinematic musing, but a film that is adapted from a memoir needs to have a feeling of realism that `Eat Pray Love' lacks.

It makes no sense to me that Liz would be so well received instantaneously by complete strangers, but that is just me.

Julia Roberts is a good actress.  She's not great, but she's good, and she's better when she allows the natural charm of her comedic skills to take over (don't take yourself too seriously) so when she gets angry and tries to act upset she comes across awkward and unsure of herself, but when she giggles and smiles and charms the audience it works gloriously.  Thank god for Richard Jenkins and Javier Bardem, who OWN this film.  Their supporting characters are the most engaging, and their superior acting skills completely take over their scenes; especially Jenkins who breaks your heart in a million pieces while maintaining quick wit and sharp delivery.  Viola Davis is underused (I wish she had been the film's star) and James Franco is a hot mess, emphasis on `mess'.  UGH, and Billy Crudup, who is not high on my list of favorite actors, was just PERFECT here.

But really, cast aside, it was Ryan Murphy who destroyed this film.  His handling of the material was so vapid, and the poor editing choices (the flashback scenes were terribly spliced in) made the actors performances seem worse than I'm sure they were (especially Franco, who came across terribly green).

With moments of manipulated sympathies that come across more corny than sincere, `Eat Pray Love' will make you want to fast.",1302739200,,3247,4.672535211267606
4065157,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"I've not read the wildly popular memoir so I can't compare the movie to Elizabeth Gilbert's book.

The film finds Liz, Julia Roberts, in a crisis of self. As in she doesn't know who she is -- she lives as an extension of of the man in her life and is dissatisfied. She receives a prophecy about her life and marriage. This prophecy winds its way under her skin and she festers with discontent.

What results is a slow discovery of who she is and who she wants to become. Liz removes herself from life for a year and sets out to find the happiness she hopes she can find.

4065160,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Was curious about this film since it includes two of my favorite actors, James Franco and Javier Bardem. I didn't read the book prior to seeing the film. Julia Roberts was refreshing; I felt she was at ease in her acting and not trying so hard as I've often seen in her previous films.

If you've ever experienced a failed marriage and have a sense of adventure, in a modern way, you may relate well to this film.

Three men, three countries, one final positive outcome for her. (What a fairytale!)

Julia Roberts plays a soon-to-be-divorced woman fortunate enough to be able to travel long term and to the places she has chosen: Italy, India, and Bali. We see her willingness to explore her inner self, meet new people (mainly the non-threatening kind), and connect the hurt pieces of herself to the world. The best character and acting job goes to Richard Jenkins (Richard from Texas); his sincere portrayal of a man haunted by his actions hit me hard.

We see the guilt for her husband (Billy Crudup), the fling(?) with David (James Franco), and her bond to Philippe (Javier Bardem).

I could relate to all three relationships so I found the film enjoyable.",1301875200,,1160,4.666666666666667
4065161,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"OK, I tried, I really, really tried. Lasted 18 minutes of this dreck. Try NEVER to watch a movie where Julia eats. Basically she looks like a horse trying to eat an apple through a wire fence! Her huge mouth is further enhanced by the badly done (upper) lip job that looks smeared now that she's definitely beginning to show age. I never knew what all the hulabaloo about her was about.

And this movie has been done before. It was called ""Shirley Valentine"", unhappy for no reason housewife abandons a perfectly good marriage/husband to run away and have an affair. Didn't work for that one, doesn't work here. She whines about going from boyfriend to boyfriend in her early life and never having time for me, me, ME!!!!!!! So what does she do? She goes overseas to go from boyfriend to boyfriend. At least that's what the other reviewers said. I ain't wasting 2 1/2 hours of MY life on this turkey!!!",1301702400,2,902,4.533742331288344

4065163,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"I was really excited to see the movie; however after the first 15 minutes I wanted to stop watching this due to it's extremely odd beginning that set the tone for the whole story.  You see in the beginning, Julia Robert's character, is a journalist who travels to Bali (Indonesia)to get a story on love.  There she meets a spiritual advisor who reads her PALM (okay this is where they started losing me)and tells her she will be married 2 times and lose most of her money within a year.  When she returns to the States she tells her husband she wants a divorce (based on that ridiculous palm reading).  Hello...can you say ""selfish"", ""morally shallow"", etc.

I forced myself to watch the whole movie thinking there had to be a lesson to be learned.  Nope.  Naddah.  The only redeeming value was the character was able to help a woman friend and her child in Bali realize their dream of owning their own home through the monetary gifts from her friends in the states.  That's the ONLY good part of the movie.

And it's ironic that in the entire movie she says she refuses to be defined by a man's love/relationship and absolutely says she will not marry again.  She ends up marrying the guy (not in the movie, but real life later on) because of his immigration status in the states...what goes around, comes around.

Yes, she does break some hearts including her husbands and her rebound boy toy but Robert's character is trying to find her own happiness instead of depending on a man's ""idea"" of happiness. Along the way, she does learn to love again but first she must learn to love herself. I didn't think this film was self-indulgent or boring, check it out!",1301356800,,646,4.391666666666667

4065167,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"I read through some of the other reviews, but I absolutely loved this movie! (I love movies based on true stories.) I'm sure a great deal was missing and to really get the full picture you needed to read the book. But I would recommend this to any woman who is in her 40's (even 30's) that has experienced life and different relationships. The characters in this were truly believable. I hate to stereotype, but the ""want-a-be"" actor she gets mixed up with and thinks she is love with was so dead on. Her explanation / analysis in front of an audience of this kind of love was truly believable. (Think about people in your own life who have ended a realtionship and jumped right into another one without taking time to heal, etc.) I tend to be an extremely giving person and I did not look at this from the angle of her being a selfish human being. Why? Well a two hour movie is not going to give you the complete picture without reading the book.

The movie doesn't really develop her relationship gone sour with her husband and I would hope the book explained / had more detail on this. I wasn't making an assumption this non christian suddendly decides as her last resort sto pray to God (it was very apparent she lacked this in her life) for help and then tell her husband it's over. There is always alot more to a story. My guage was that the movie picked up pretty much at the end of a relationship and that the main character was not willing to work on it. Once again we are missing the ""rest of the story"". So you have to pick up her journey from there.

Talk about courage. Imagine, as she stated in the movie, she has always been in a realtionship with someone since 15 and now she is not in any relationship and completely leaving her comfort zone. She's not moving to another state - she is leaving the country!! Everyone she knows, everyday surroundings, all of it! Think about taking that kind of a risk in todays world as a single female. And along this journey they portrayed that she met some truly good people Vs. those trying to harm. Talk about luck and finding goodness in others. Once again the movie portrays the more sunshine piece of this and not the difficult / pissy situations she encountered by going to 3 different places she was not familiar with. Imagine having a great time in Italy, being happy and then uprooting yourself to India with no guarantees of any sort. (If you want to analzye it here is this needy person who was looking for anyone to fulfill what was missing from her life and now she is on a quest to find peace within herself that doesn't necessarily equate to being with someone. Here was a dependent person who now is independent. That is a leap).

This movie conveyed a sense of real people with real emotions. I cried when the character from Texas finally opened up to her and explained why he needed to forgive himself. And I have no doubt that he truly gave her the nickname ""Groceries"". It was brilliant when her ex-husband to be conveyed to her that he had no idea what her issues were. Pathetic yes from the standpoint that people fail to truly communicate with each other in life. The characters in this were believable. Even the Brazilian gentleman she meets. I would bet  it was true that this guy was hurt so badly by his ex-wife that he hadn't given his heart to anyone in almost 10 years.

Sure based on some of the reviews not everyone will like this movie. But it you have taken chances in life and moved from your comfort zone you may have a totally different reaction to this movie and a different level of interpretation. In closing another interpretation - I was so very disappointed years ago when I finally watched ""The Way We Were"" with Barbara Streistand. I did not think it was a love story at all. I saw this woman who continually gave to someone and so desperately wanted their love and they would never love her the same. When it was over I couldn't believe this movie was ever hyped as a love story. Maybe one sided. Food for thought -  when you read reviews please remember everyone has their own opinions / interpretations based on their own life experiences. Read more than one review before you make a decision.

When this movie was over I was reminded of how grateful I am for what I have in my life and the good people I have met along the way. And how fortunate I was that I had found true love.",1301097600,2,4381,4.374692874692875
4065168,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"You guessed it, not my turn to pick the movie. In the past this worked for the best, getting exposed to good movies I would not had picked otherwise. This time though I was itching for a magazine well before the movie was halfway through.

A woman in mid-life crisis ends her unfulfilling marriage to her equally immature and directionless husband for no other major reason. The divorce is messy with a lot of guilt to be distributed around. A brief (cougar-)affair ends equally badly so she embarks in a year-long journey to redefine herself.

The journey starts from Italy where apparently she learns to appreciate life's little pleasures and how to enjoy them guilt-free. This part made me hungry for good Italian pasta with fresh tomato sauce and basil but little else. Having said that I have been to Naples and (with all due respect to my Napolitano friends), one can find much better-tasting pizza in New York.
By the way, when someone decides to accept her body no matter its imperfections and goes shopping for larger jeans, she does not then proceed to force the zippers of ...smaller sizes.

India was next and it was a disaster. The guru she has traveled so far to meet is visiting the US and her disciples run her ashram like something between a hostel and a Scientology sweat-shop. She receives no enlightening guidance except some overused bromides from a Texan in his post-alcoholic guilt trip.
I love Indian culture and have a great respect for Indian people. However, unlike SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, this movie will not make you want to visit this mesmerizing country.

Finally, Bali where she meets again a toothless old medicine-man/palm reader. She copies some notes; she runs a short but effective charity fund; and she finds lust/love in the sad eyes of a Brazilian divorcee. What did she learn in the previous year: apparently nothing because she is about to run away from that relationship as well. Will she? Well, at that point point I could not care less.

No worries about job, money, responsibilities or obligations to others - no wonder she experienced ennui. Now she's even wealthier for publishing the nauseating drivel about her useless life, and we're expected to think of her as courageous and deep. No way.

That being said, this movie was worse than the book.  The highlight for me was being able to see gorgeous parts of Italy, but it was a complete struggle not to leave the theatre before the movie ended.

It's very difficult to translate a book into a movie and this one failed.  The movie felt like it went on forever and it didn't connect with the audience.  It was difficult for me to sympathize or even like the Liz character.  The movie is boring, yet it also felt rushed.  If they were trying to convey Liz's struggles and her journey to self-discovery, it was done poorly.

Shallow,narcissitic,selfish,mired in'comfort',regarding poverty as 'picturesque'[and avoiding it like the plague in India and Bali except for one sight of the ride from the airport in the case of the latter].
I wouldn't be suprised if Al Quaeda used it as part of their recruiting drivel.
It really is awful and while my wife and I watched it in elequent surprise,I reflected on the beautiful shots of the luxury ashram in India and resort in Bali, thinking of the thousands of unsung people in the world who actually do good for other people,the thousands who travel to really meet 'ordinary' people and try to help their environments.
Such a morally twisted work as this does very poor service to the view of the American middle class.
Perhaps big American studio bosses should leave deep and serious thinking to the British.

4065178,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"`Eat, Pray, Love' is an average film with a decent message and as I haven't read the book I can only review this film based on it's own merits, rather than comparing it to the message the book imparts.

This film follows Liz (Julia Roberts) after she divorces her husband and travels to Italy, India and Bali as she tries to find some meaning in her life.  She learns about herself, makes some friends and has some amazing experiences, like travel will often do for anyone.

I hate to say it, but this film is overly sentimental and whilst the basic message is a good one (being true to yourself and finding god within you) this film feels like it has to spell it out for you as if you are stupid and can't grasp the message being rammed down your throat at every turn.  This may sound harsh and I don't mean it to, as this is perfectly watchable and entertaining, but I don't know why film makers feel the need to dumb things down to such a degree that they almost insult the viewers intelligence.  The `meaningful' voice-overs spelling things out particularly started to grate by the end of the film.

Roberts is pretty average in this film and Bardem is probably the best of the actors here.  Saying that, Richard Jenkins is very good as well and deserves a mention.  The direction is ok and is certainly very glossy and shows the countries off to spectacular effect (like a glorified tourist advert for each destination), but it lacks a certain depth and, like the film in general, it feels rather superficial.

Don't get me wrong, this film is good enough and certainly has something to offer, but it has no nuance and isn't as `deep' as it likes to think it is.  The book may be a whole lot better, but judging this is on it's own merits I'd say this is a good but not great film and it is worth a watch; just don't expect too much and you should be fine.

Having sugary Julia Roberts play Gilbert only makes all of this worse. And to top it off, the movie is drainingly boring, with even the scenery failing to generate interest.  In short, the movie lacks both substance *and* style.

4065184,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"Is there a more wishy washy actress than Julia Roberts? I certainly haven't come across one. Perhaps the least deserving Best Actress Oscar winner in history, Roberts has relied on her 'charming smile' to get through roles without any discernible 'acting' going on. Case in point : ""Erin Brokovich"" and the woefully overwrought ""My Best Friends Wedding"". However, there are some of us who find Roberts' wide jawed smile rather disconcerting, unsettling and a little frightening, and lets just say this film does nothing to prove her case as an 'actress'.

The book was bad enough (not many of you know that what happened to the author after the book was published and it is probably not going to make a very savory movie), but the film takes all of its vapid elements and multiplies it by a 100. The 'Pray' section for instance, is bewildering. Its difficult to ascertain what Roberts is going through when she closes her eyes on her meditative journeys, but on film these segments don't make any sense and don't reveal anything at all, except that a woman somewhere is closing her eyes. The director is especially gifted at sucking the life out of a scene, it has to be mentioned.

The problem is with the script, as well as with Roberts over-confident performance. She might perhaps think that shes at a stage in her life where she can 'walk through' any role, but lets face it, the woman barely got through ""The Mexican"" without being upstaged by Pitt at every stage so she should really rethink her acting strategies. The worst part is the end, which neatly ties together her escapades and presents it as a more holistic episode of ""Sex and the City"" (should be seen to be believed). The supporting cast, often goodlooking but seldom talented, are totally wasted. The cinematography is beautiful but any of you with a home camera in any of these locations would find it hard to take a bad shot, so thats not saying much. Bali and Italy are pretty hard to tamper with on film. Sadly, they seemed to have captured the worst of India here, which is stereotypical of a film that tries to go the spiritual route (much like Kate Winslet in ""Holy Smoke""). Javier Bardem, who is one of the worlds most nuanced actors is relegated to the role of a caricature here, while James Franco (whos lets face it is not going to win an Oscar for expressionism) plays an enlightened palm reader in Bali, which doesn't at all help matters. Billy Crudup is the best thing about this film, and at least he has the decency to only appear for a few minutes here and there.

Bottom line, if you don't like Roberts' 'work', stay far, far away. Also, it might be of note that was a lot of eating going on in the film, and much less praying and loving. Well, at least they could keep their lunch down. Grab a pillow and pray for daylight if this is the mess you plan on renting tonight.

Well, to say it better - I really enjoyed ""eating"" and ""loving"" - the ""praying"" was a little lost on me and seemed a little lengthy in comparison.  I finally got around to watching the movie this past weekend.  I liked it.  It wasn't my favorite movie..... but I thought it was decent.  I do think the book is a LOT better.  It's just too large a subject matter to try to cram into a 2 hour long movie.

Julie Roberts was the ideal choice for the main character, Liz.  I thought she brought a lot to the character - after all, this story is based on a real woman's life experiences.  At times, the movie seemed a bit rushed, but again, I think that has more to do with the fact that you're cramming a year long journey into 2 hours of film.

A lot of people didn't like the book, and subsequently the movie, because they felt that it was all me, me, me and that the author was self-centered or self-righteous.  Newsflash - the book is a memoir - which is autobiographical writing.  Did those people not realize that?

I personally enjoyed the movie - but then again, I really enjoyed the book.  A friend of mine hated the book, but liked the movie - go figure!  It's hard for me to judge because I actually have read the book, but I think I was able to get more out of the movie because I knew a little bit more about what was actually happening - the parts of the story that the movie only touched on or didn't include at all.

I wanted to like it but I have to echo what the other reviews said about it. It was almost impossible to empathize with anything this woman was feeling, hard to relate to anything in this story. This story should have been titled ""How much I love myself"". The main character is self absorbed, irrational and unreasonable. She wanders far and wide to find herself and ""marvel"" at something, and throws away everything she has ever worked for and hurts people that did not deserve to be hurt. An important message in this movie was that in order to change how you feel you must change how you think. and yes it is very difficult. You do not have to take a trip around the world to teach yourself to love honestly, to be true to yourself or to find spirituality. I would suggest this movie if you have two hours that you really want to waste. If you have read the book (I havent), you may want to watch it.

I agree with another reviewer the companions in Italy were the most interesting part of the movie but never really developed the characters. The reason for the main character's up and leaving husband - the hopping in/out of bed from husband to flaky actor to sensual Javier Bardem. I could not emphathize with the character. Too self absorbed and she brought the unhappiness upon herself.

4065201,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"You'll love the scenery in this movie - especially of course ROME with Bali second. I think there was great effort by the director to make you feel like you're there too.

It doesn't matter that I read the book. This movie leaves far too much of the relationships to the imagination. Especially the two most important relationships of the main character, Liz. First we discover that Liz is unhappy in her marriage, but we're not exactly sure why. The dialogue makes an effort to try to fill us in... but we've arrived at the very end of the marriage and aren't privy to the WHY.

What kinda bothers me about the character, Liz, is that she jumps right into another relationship while going through her divorce, but this time we see it through from beginning to end and STILL aren't privy to the ""fights"" they later discuss when breaking up.

Do not read further if you don't want the story ruined...

Liz's next relationship evolves the same way ... but there's no chemistry that I can see - although they seem to pretend there is - here it really seems like acting. The Brazilian boyfriend seems too course for her... he seems just WRONG... that's not to say I haven't seen this actor in other movies and thought he was fantastic... it's just that with Julia Roberts it doesn't work. But apparently as the movie ends, he's ""the one"". After less than a year in which she broke up her marriage, ended her interim relationship, she has found Mr. IT? It's too fairy tale for me... but this is supposedly based on a true story so I guess it's possible. I've been married and divorced... it's not often that people rebound so quickly. That amazes me... it's just not my own experience. For me this movie left me cold... I didn't feel this woman had truly progressed emotionally... she just jumped from partner to partner.

4065204,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"The movie had the feel of a New York Times Magazine article put to film.  Ugh.  Self-involved, self-indulgent, East Coast, upper-middle class, spoiled  woman (who supposedly loses ""all her money"" at the beginning of the film but still can fly to Rome, hang out for months at a time with no visible means of support, then hang out in India for another few months, then Bali for a few months after that -- who knew you losing all your money resulted in a jet-set lifestyle?) travels the world to find herself and in the end, doesn't really do a very good job at that simple task.  This is just a variation of the annoying paeans to the bourgeoisie we see every couple of years, e.g., ""Click!""; ""The Family Man.""  If you want real self-discovery material, see ""The Razor's Edge"" or the unfortunately forgotten ""Bagdad Caf.""

As for Ms. Roberts, she seems bent on fulfilling her own prophecy from ""Notting Hill"": ""one day not long from now, my looks will go, they will discover I can't act and I will become some sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while.""",1295827200,16,1088,4.525510204081633
4065205,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"The way they hyped up this movie and book - whose premise I really do like - I expected a nice piece depicting someone's journey through self-discovery. Instead, it turned out to be a trite two hour movie depicting the shameless self-indulgences and superficiality of a vain person on the quest for the elusive ""finding yourself"" mantra she undoubtedly read up upon in the self help aisle at Barnes and Noble. Because of how the character acted and was portrayed, the audience just never gets to identify and empathize with her and her ""problems"". For two hours you sit there and watch her whine about her life, how it is/was so unhappy and unfulfilled and what have you, but you never know why really. If the goal is to have the audience empathize with a character and identify with it, they have to know what's bothering them, be let in on their pain and unhappiness. That is what makes a great movie. The writers in this one seemed to want the audience to just take their word for it that she was unhappy and unfulfilled - despite all evidence to the contrary. Someone once said if the problem is in one's head, it still is a problem. But in this movie, we never get to see what that is - imagined or real. The worst thing a movie maker can do is create unrelateable characters.

Julia Roberts did a lousy job and her character is both unlikeable and unrelateable. This movie is supposed to tell us that material things and money are not the source to happiness and that there are other sources of happiness unrelated to such external things. Yet the main character (Roberts) spends a year travelling around the world living in great places that cost a lot of money. Later on, this movie promoted a lip-gloss by Lnacome or something. Yeah...way to send a message about material things not mattering. They should have pointed out that trying to find yourself when you are broke is much harder to do. Luckily, Roberts in this movie didn't have to worry about that ""tiny detail"". One should be so lucky to have so much money that it is not worth mentioning anymore - even though it still is used to buy you all the sanity and self-discovery trips in the world.

But it is not just that. The main character was annoying for other reasons as well. I mean her spiritual guide is a self-announced medicine man in Bali with amnesia. Yes amnesia, as in brain damage. She turns her life upside down because of the random crap he made up and told her, and then a year later when she goes back, to tell her ""mentor"" what she did, he doesnt even remember her!! It was hilarious. I thought they were kidding and that at this point the movie would take a turn; that her character would finally realize how immature and insane it was to do all those things to herself based on the random musings of a silly, old man who doesnt even know her. But NO. It stayed. That was it. Oh so conveniently, the shaman starts suddenly remembering her after she is about to burst into tears at the realization that she might have screwed up her life based on the words of a random, senile man.  That's deep.

The movie went downhill from there at an alarming rate. I have never seen so much substance-deficiency and implausibility of both story and characters packed into two hours or so of narcissistic screen time for a middle-aged actress. The supporting characters were unlikable too and Julia Roberts just seemed too old and burned out for some of the ""boys"" she dated - like James Franco. They wanted to make it look like her relationship with Franco - which she started 5 minutes after her divorce by the way - didn't work out for other deep reasons, like she loved him, but it is obvious that it didn't work out cause she is too old for him and he a vacuous moron.  And then Javier Bardem. Obviously both of these people are on rebound, especially Bardem (who is 39 and has a 20 year old son but ok) but still after a couple of weeks of humping in the tropical hut, he confesses his ever endearing love for her like a starry-eyed 17 year old teenager. I seriously thought she knew better and would respond that she didn't feel the same way, that she didn't love him. But ta da, it turns out - despite all evidence to the contrary and what we see - she is in fact madly in love with him but (how original) is too scared to admit it cause she is afraid to get hurt. Yeah right. Could they have packed any more lame cliches into that?

They could and they did because in the end, just like any other woman I guess, all she needed obviously to get out of her funk was love and riding off into the sunset (literally) with her man.

Coming out of this garbage they tried to pass as a ""wonderful journey"" I figured that not only did I not get anything out of this movie and the supposed journey, but that obviously neither did the protagonist. Just as we never found out why she was really having a crisis and was unhappy, we also never find out why and how she got happy again. This movie is based on the premise that she lost her mojo and needed to find it, but looking closer it seems that she never had it. After that one year of travelling and exploring and meeting all these supposedly cool and enlightened people (quitters is more like it, see Bardem's character), she doesnt seem to have found more purpose in life than before. She doesnt look and act changed, enlightened or as if she had gained some insight into who she really is and what she really wants out of life. She spent a year travelling around, ""hanging out"" and having a good time and all she got to show for is a man. As expected, because by being a self-absorbed, spoiled brat who never had to do a hard day's work in life and doesn't listen to people you are not likely to gain insight into anything. Spiritually, she could have been Carrie Bradshaw's sidekick when she went into hysteria.

In the end, she is exactly where she started: nowhere, drowning in her own superficiality and shallow-ness. The only exciting thing in her life will be a long distance relationship with Bardem between Bali and New York until she gets bored again and leaves, thinking that maybe the answers in life are to be found in the elusive wisdom of this one medicine man she read up upon on her last trip to the self help aisle - this time at Borders.",1295827200,,6280,4.393809114359415

I think that is probably b/c there are probably thousands of woman out there who have felt what she is feeling yet don't have the cash or profession to take off for a year.  While the lead up to why Elizabeth is so unhappy in her marriage is barely hinted at in the movie (this i agree with, except it's only a two hour movie, and it would take at least 1/2 hour or 40 minutes to adequately portray that, and we, the audience, want to see Italy, so, chop chop), it is covered quite painfully actually in the book, at which point i almost put it down. I think the reason i didn't put the book down, was because Gilbert can actually be quite a good writer. There are soooo many self-help/travelogue/transformative whatever books out there, which i might be inclined to read, and have tried, and after a few dozen or so over the years, most discarded after a chapter or two, the narrator here is self aware enough to point out her own flaws and write well while doing it, so i didn't put it down. If you read any interviews with E. Gilbert, or the first couple of chapters of her other book Committed, you might come away understanding that she really didn't intend or expect this to become a sensation. I have been known on principle, not to see something or read something, b/c it is  a sensation, makes me distrust it. Whatever, I went to see the movie to get a vicarious trip to Bali and Italy, which i got, so I'm not complaining too much. And the whole complaint that these are first world problems and thus shallow, etc., yes, except if you are THAT unhappy in a marriage, get out before you inflict yourselves on children.

4065215,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"Let me start out by saying that I did read the book before seeing the movie, and well...that was no easy task. Once I got passed the part where Liz is in Italy, I had to force myself to get through the remaining two-thirds of the book. I never saw the movie in theaters, because I knew I wanted to finish the book before watching the film, but it took me several months to finally get through the book. Once I finished my reading, I was verrrry disappointed and was hoping that the film, which had just come out on DVD/BluRay, would bring this woman's story to life and prove much less painful to sit through as it was to read.

Often, books are made into films that really shouldn't be. Generally, people tend to prefer the book over the movie, but at least the film is ""pretty good"" and watchable. Not the case with Eat, Pray, Love! I think the main issue is that it isn't another great fiction novel about love, or wizards, or vampires. Basically, the book reads like a diary or journal. This isn't a ""story"" or a ""tale"" it is simply the author, Elizabeth Gilbert's, account of everything that happened to her during this period of her life. So there is honestly no beginning, middle, and end. There is no climax, not even a plot. This kind of writing can slide in the literary world (referred to as non-fiction or autobiography) but it's very difficult to translate non-fiction to the big screen unless it's a documentary, like March of the Penguins or something.

I don't know what I was expecting from the film... I guess I thought maybe the filmmakers would add in a plot to make it more interesting. Honestly, the movie probably wouldn't have been too bad if it were simply BASED on the book, not translated verbatim. But no, the movie was filmed the way the book was written, minus all the narrative that made the book at least sometimes amusing or intriguing. It is IMPOSSIBLE to sympathize with the character in the film... basically it just appears that Liz is suddenly very unhappy in her marriage for some reason, and instead of discussing it with her husband like an adult or putting forth any effort at all to save the marriage, she bolts. BAM! DIVORCE! Makes you want to grab her by the face and say ""look you dumb bitch, this isn't some casual boyfriend who you don't really like anymore, so you just break it off and move on. He is your HUSBAND!"" What kind of a message is this woman sending out? That if you are even the slightest bit unhappy in your marriage, you don't address the problem, you just file for divorce and run away to a different country??

So the film starts out with the main character, Liz, pulling a very selfish move (and practically out of nowhere since the movie lacks the narrative that the book includes to provide a bit of explanation and reason for her actions..), making her rather unlikeable and unable to relate to. A main character that the audience hates... not a good way to start off a motion picture. The part in Italy was at least visually appealing (and appetizing..), however, kind of randomly pieced together like a collage, including various shots of tourist spots, food, Italian people, and Julia Roberts doing the ""Julia Roberts laugh."" I recall the scene where she claims to have gained all this weight and is struggling (to the point of having to lie on the floor) to put on a pair of jeans, even though there is no visual evidence of this supposed ""weight gain."" It's like when a 110 lb woman is complaining about her love handles... you just kind of want to slap her.

I was watching the movie with a friend who hadn't even read the book, so I couldn't even imagine how torturous this movie-watching experience was for her. Once it got to the VERY sudden flip flop over to Bali, my friend and I just couldn't take it anymore and fast-fowarded to the rather anti-climactic love scene with Javier Bardem. I remembered seeing him in the previews and wondered which character he was going to portray in the film, but was surprised to see him playing a character who, in the book, was supposed to be much older than Liz. I'm pretty certain that Javier Bardem is younger than, or at least the same age as Julia Roberts, but whatever. Soon after this scene, they run away together and the movie concludes with them riding a boat off into the distance or something cliche like that.

Bottom line: This movie has no plot, the main character is irritating and impossible to relate to, and the last two-thirds of the movie (and the book) are extremely difficult to get through without burying your face into a pillow and screaming. The only delightful part of the film is Richard Jenkins' portrayal of the character Richard from Texas, but sadly his appearance in the film ends very abruptly and the movie starts to suck again. And the brief period in which she dates David, played by james Franco, seems pointless, unnecessary and almost kind of irrelevant to the rest of the film. Unless you're in the mood to watch a crappy movie and make fun of it with a friend or loved one, I suggest not wasting your time or money on this one.",1295395200,25,5088,4.51409978308026

The book has to be better than the movie!  The movie is a waste of time.  I felt no compassion for Julia Robert's character. Her big crises in life?  Not loving a devoted husband.  ""Losing herself"" in relationships as evidenced by the remodeling of her kitchen when she is not a cook.  Not being able to clear her mind during meditation.  Jumping from man to man to make herself feel better, and hurting these men in the process.

Her big contributions in life?  Praying for a 17-year old who does not want to be the bride in an arranged marriage.  Asking her friends to use the money they would spend on her birthday presents to help her friend in Bali buy a house.

If you want to see a self-indulgent, rich girl, cope with the ""crises"" she has created in life, then you may enjoy this movie.  Most of us, however, have pains much harder than this woman, and we have to pick ourselves up each day, go to work, and care for our loved ones.

4065224,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"I knew the moment I heard Julie Roberts was cast as the lead in Eat, Pray, Love! the movie was doomed. Now don't get me wrong, I've been a long time fan of Julie Roberts since the early days, and thoroughly enjoyed Pretty Woman, Erin Brockovich, Notting Hill, and Charlie Wilson's War.  What's happened to her acting talents since then is a mystery.  Roberts acting range these days seems to be limited to either a fast talking loud mouth adolescent or an emotionally collapsed, poor me, lost soul wandering through life.  I think directors, producers, and writers get blindsided by all of the hype around a star. From my point of view, Julia Roberts amazing lack of depth in this role is responsible for the failure of the film. Even Javier Bardem couldn't save it.  Julia's song I fear, has been sung.

Eat, Pray, Love's heroine should have been a younger, more earthy woman who could bring to life the emotional trauma in her marriage, her lusty full bodied eating adventures in Italy, and finally some reasonable realistic interpretation of having found some serenity and peace through self-exploration and the mysteries of meditation.  They should have held auditions before committing.(Perhaps Rachel McAdams in The Notebook - an Oscar performance if I ever saw one).

Ryan Murphy is a talented writer and director who produced the racy Nip/Tuck, and the now highly popular Glee.  We know he's talented so what happened with Eat, Pray, Love? Did he allow Roberts to interpret the role for him?  Sure looks that way, as his
characters on Nip/Tuck were complex. At least Viola Davis was in it, and she brings a depth to any role you see her in. The film for all its beauty in parts was as shallow as Roberts acting.  What a shame!  So many of us who read the book were looking forward to a great fun movie and in the end it was disposable.

Julia Roberts - D.",1294876800,,1923,4.577259475218659
4065225,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"I've missed Julia Roberts.  Either I have been watching different movies or she hasn't been in many lately. I forgot how much I enjoyed her acting.  She comes across despite her obvious attractiveness as a genuine person with many levels on the screen. This role was no exception.

Having not read the book, I have nothing but, the movie to comment on. I enjoyed it.  The characters were interesting and complex. Liz, Julia's character, essentially did what many women do, absorb their boyfriend's/husband's interests and make them their own. Often time, laying their own interests aside.

This character combines her interests in travel with her search for herself.  Ironically one of her choices India combines a former boyfriend's interest in a particular guru. This I found a bit odd. Maybe his interest awakened one in her.

The ending which I will not reveal here, was to me a bit ironic and counter-intuitive.  Especially with the character's gut punch reaction.  I said, when I saw it....here we go again...

Good luck.

This was an entertaining movie and reminded me of many of the people in my life that have offered advice; solicited and unsolicited. When you look back you think, hmm, they made sense or what a bunch of crap.  Sometimes the two are not immediately obvious.",1294790400,,1285,4.898148148148148

4065231,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Unfortunately, I think this movie watered down some of the themes of the book, and the character of Elizabeth Gilbert, to the point where it lost its depth. Part of what makes Elizabeth Gilbert likable in the book (and in my opinion she is likable, although I know some people don't feel that way) is that she is a keen observer and social commentator, in addition to being funny. Her sharpness, particularly her ironic insights, and her humor were entirely lost in this movie, leaving the character kind of insipid.

Themes were watered down too. In the book, Elizabeth Gilbert's uncertainty about wanting kids, and the resentment she feels at social and familial pressure to do so, is more of a driver in the dissolution of her marriage than it is here. Perhaps the writers/producers felt that a mainstream audience couldn't handle questioning of social convention on that scale. As another example, in the book when Elizabeth collects money from her Western friends to help her Balinese friend Wayan purchase a house, the resulting problems spur an interesting analysis of cultural differences, and the problems inherent in trying to help someone from another social world. In the movie it's watered down to a feel-good success story (as is Elizabeth's romance there, while in the book it is considerably more complicated.) The India spiritual scenes are pretty watered down too - her insights are more self-helpy than spiritual.

All that being said, I enjoyed watching Julia Roberts most of the time, and most of the supporting cast was very strong, especially Richard Jenkins and Javier Bardem. The shots of Italy, India and Bali were all lovely. So set your expectations accordingly, especially if you've read the book, and you can enjoy what there is to enjoy in this movie. If you want the true insights of the book though, just read it.",1294617600,2,1846,4.932475884244373

4065233,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Three stars for the scenic locations and the actors who did the best they could with what they were given.  This is watchable if you can suspend disbelief and fall in love with a selfish protagonist who doesn't deserve anybody's love.  That was one of the main problem's with this.  This is a woman who jumped into relationships she shouldn't have been in at the expense of others.  The issues she had in these relationships were never quite valid or clear.  I think it's probably a testament to many relationships these days where people just leave over tiny shreds.

I didn't read the book so I imagine it was probably fantastic, but it's my understanding that some of what really happened to this author were adjusted in the movie.  If you can believe that the author's life was even more selfish than the way the movie portrays.  They actually had to tone it down a little or she would've really been vilified.

For example: In the movie the Julia Roberts character wakes up one day from her marriage to the Billy Crudup character and decides she wants a divorce.  He presses her for a good reason which she's unable to divulge eloquently.  She then proceeds to fall into a passionate romance with a younger guy played by James Franco.  She goes through the same turmoil with him and leaves him setting off on a year journey to Italy, India and Bali to find herself.

How it allegedly really went down was the real author cheated on her husband with this younger guy and left her husband for him.  That younger guy then cheated on her and left her in the end.  Now that should've been in the movie to teach one a lesson about how you treat others will come back to bite you.  I guess the filmmakers thought that the audiences would think she deserved it.  There is no way around her life.  It was all me-me-me and I-I-I.

She spends a good portion in Italy eating her way through it and hanging with new friends.  Her friend complains that she needs to stop eating because she's gaining a few pounds.  The Julia Roberts character says, ""Has a guy ever thrown you out or said something?"" The friend says, ""No.""  Julia says, ""Because he hit the jackpot he's with a naked woman.""  Um - obviously she doesn't know much about what the man is REALLY thinking.

All in all the story could've been worked a bit more to make her more of a likable protagonist.  The reason she's likable at all is because we're watching Julia Roberts who brings good things to the screen.  The message is hidden in there deep if you can get past all that.  And the scenery, acting and the way the film is shot keeps you afloat and interested.  There is a message in it that were all looking for enlightenment or answers or to be happy, but just don't use others or jump into relationships you're not ready for, because you then you just look like a dishonest loser.

Julia Roberts makes this work - an unknown actress might not have been able to bring as much light as possible to such a negative character.  Does the protagonist find everything she's looking for?  The last half hour of the movie is the more intriguing, so it does end with a bang, but will you be able to hold out until you get there?  If there is any great line it's the man-friend she meets while praying in India.  He says, ""To get to the castle - you got to swim through the moat.""  He's full of soliloquy's to which she asks, ""Do you always talk in bumper stickers?""  That was a line from the movie, ""Postcards from the Edge"" with Meryl Streep by the way.

4065244,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"How could you go wrong with Julia Roberts? Doesn't she always make movies golden?

With Eat Pray Love, Roberts encapsulates the adult version of Bella, of Twilight. Starring as Liz Gilbert, Julia Roberts spends most of her screen time crying over the fact that she has lost herself and doesn't have a boyfriend.

Billy Crudup is Liz's husband who can't seem to settle down on any one job or idea. He is always trying new things and this unnerves Liz. So she asks for a divorce.

Soon after she leaves her husband, Liz hooks up with a young actor played by James Franco. See what happens? You sleep with Julia Roberts and, before you know it, you're nominated for an Oscar.

Liz then takes a year to find herself in Italy, India and Bali.

She eats incredibly good looking food in Europe, gets eaten by mosquitoes in India and finally ends up getting run off the road by a Gerard Butler look-a-like. Does anyone not think these two will end up together?

I meditate and do yoga.  Judaism is well known as a religion that celebrates eating well, and we don't have any of those annoying vows of celibacy (I have five kids).

Not only that, the movie takes place in New York, Italy, India, and Bali - all places I have been to and that I like.

So I was positively predisposed to this film.  I went into it with high expectations.  Which made my disappointment all the greater.  I found the movie very tedious.

I was concerned that maybe it's because I'm a guy, and as my 14-year-old daughter pointed out, this is a real ""chick flick.""  I was relieved to discover that my wife - who likes Jane Austen movies - also thought Eat, Pray, Love was tedious.  It wasn't just my testosterone speaking!

The pluses: Julia Robert is still easy on the eyes, despite her advancing years (look, none of us is getting younger).  No problem believing that the young hunks would still think she's hot.  If you like food, you'll like the ""food porn"" in Italy.  But the film has a lot of weaknesses:

* The basic premise is not plausible.  The protagonist has a life most women I know would die for.  A great writing job, a hot husband, incredible friends, a beautiful house.  Where does all the angst come from?  You want to travel and your husband doesn't?  Get over it.  Go write your article about Aruba and come home to a nice house.

* The pacing is VERY slow.  Excruciatingly slow at times.  This film is not ""arty"" enough, not ""eye candy"" enough to get away with moving so slow.

* Everywhere she goes it seems she runs into people spouting clichs and platitudes that she takes for profound wisdom.  ""The sweetness of doing nothing (it sounds better in Italian)."" The paradox of how hard you have to work at relaxing and meditating.  That sometimes you find balance by giving up your balance to love.  Etc.  All said by very different gurus: Italians in a barbershop, a rough Texan who has absorbed all the wisdom of the ashram, a toothless old medicine man in Bali.

* Instead of spouting platitudes a real friend would listen.  She never reveals why she is so filled with angst about her life and harsh feelings toward her husband and then her boyfriend.

I spent time at an ashram in India, spent some time in Bangkok, some time in Rome, some time in London and Paris.  I had wonderful experiences, and a lot of fun. Did I solve all of the mysteries of life, settle all of my issues... No. But I learned a lot and grew as a human being. As, I think, she did.
I was satisfied and entertained. Given that I thought this was going to be the worst movie of all time, I was really delighted.  In fact, I just ordered a copy for myself, because I want to see it again... and will probably watch it a third time at some point.",1293408000,2,1282,4.220408163265306

4065265,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"To put it simply, Eat Pray Love is a movie with beautiful scenery and about a woman who feels unfulfilled and seeks the help of people who seem to be experts on how to live life. Don't expect anything too deep. The writers expected viewers to have read the books and so they don't give us much information as to what exactly causes her to feel such a lack of passion in the first place. Italy (Eat) provides a tourist's dream: good food, good friends, and basically the overall message of living a life of pleasure. India (Pray) is the more serious and the more interesting story here is not about Liz but of the Texan and young Indian girl we see in the movie. The message is meditation and learning to clear the mind. Bali (Love) is where it comes full circle so to speak. She learns that she is finally ready to love again. Once you love yourself, you can be free to dive into the chaos of loving someone else. The messages presented in the movie are things everyone already has heard which is why some other reviewers call it ""shallow"" which I can understand. The acting is so great that they bring more character to the screen than what the script gave them [excluding the husband and the actor, the script gave those characters no hope]. I picked Eat Pray Love so that I could watch someone do what I have always wanted...to go to a foreign place and immerse myself fully into the culture and learn some kind of lessons that could be applied in my everyday life. So despite the movie's lack of true depth I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again, just to sit and daydream and wish I could go far away as well.",1293235200,2,1623,4.342105263157895

4065272,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"[NOTE: I drastically edited my review. The essence is above the line. The addition is below. I hope this new/edited review at least helps people stop and think.]

You've probably read the raves about the scenery and food. Yes, they're great. And probably seen that Julia did what she could with this role. Again that's true. Also that she plays a main character who leaves her life behind to find herself. At least, that's what the movie is supposed to be.

But all I saw was that Liz had a great life, but thinks that friends, family, and relationships are disposable. Financial security is something to be discarded on a whim. Just go ahead and throw everything away, then focus on yourself, yourself, yourself.

Everyone else in this movie had it harder than Liz did. Her husband was willing to talk things over with her, but she refused. Then she dove straight into the arms of another man, dumping him too when she didn't feel fulfilled enough. All around the world, Liz found people whose lives were more difficult than hers. Did it give her pause to think?

Nope. All Liz learned is that she needs to be nicer to herself, to find people who make her happy, and that she can love others and herself at the same time. *gasp*

After finding this revelation, does Liz make any effort to repair the trail of shattered relationships she left behind? Does she realize that all relationships take work, maintenance, and tender loving care?

Nope. Instead, Liz just rides off into the sunset, finally knowing who she is and what she wants. Keep looking for your identity until you discover who you are. Then live happily ever after, as if relationships either work or they don't, like some kind of childhood fairy tale.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But wait! This is supposed to be an inspirational movie! A movie that shows a brave woman's journey as she travels around the world determined to find herself. Ok, great, I get that.

Now picture a MAN in this role. A MAN who divorces his rich wife and leaves all his friends because he isn't satisfied and doesn't know who he is anymore. A MAN who goes from woman to woman, feeling unloved by any of them.

A MAN traveling around the world, eating until he bursts out of his clothes. A MAN learning to be nicer to himself. A MAN caring only about himself, until he realizes he can love others and himself, and then finally lets himself fall in love again.

Is this STILL a beautiful movie?",1292716800,28,2507,4.784722222222222
4065273,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"It is a saturday night, its raining outside, and I didn't feel like Inception or Despicable Me. I was hoping for a foreign film, but the choices I looked at under ""video on demand"" at amazon didn't offer any of my choices, so I chose Eat Pray Love.

I am glad I didn't read the book, because there is nothing worse than having to read about a woman who apparently has everything drone on and on and on and on and on about having looks, career, a handsome husband, and just be so unhappy.  She didn't drone on verbally, but it was the constant state of unhappiness the character was in that was droning. It sucked my energy.

Having done my own spritual quest these past 7 years, it was topped off last June by me breaking my leg, dislocating my knee cap, and tearing ligaments, my meniscus and finally placing cracks between where the joints meet. I've done my share of spiritual quest and I approached this as teaching me something - what i learned I won't share.  Having had to use crutches since June of 2010 (its now december), I've learned to be more in tune with the disabled. I rarely see them in grocery stores, the mall, anywhere. And its taught me that we're so caught up in our own world, that the only time we care about those who live a slower life that is parallel to our superficial lives, is aroudn Christmas.

So having to sit through a movie where this woman has looks, a career, money, a handsome husband, numerous friends, is able to walk, eat, cook, essentially take care of herself, travel, and pretty much has more going for her except that she's a dreary soul is hard to sit through.

I fast forwarded through alot of it. I'm a Pisces and a big fan of Javier Bardem and he shined like a jewel; thus the 3rd star.

I wouldnt recommend eat pray love because it is a homage to egotistical maniacs who bemoan there existence and are not grateful for anything. Is that a spritual journey? Really?",1292716800,,1915,4.377464788732395

I agree with a friend of mine, Julia Roberts is an excellent actress, however someone less famous would probably have been more appropriate for this role. Kyra Sedgwick would have been my choice. She has the same quirky edge that Gilbert has. All in all the film is good. Director Ryan Murphy is pure joy in what he does with GLEE, but I would have liked perhaps a European director and crew to have made this film or Ryan Murphy could have utilized textures from European films, shadows, solitude, and angst. For some reason the film doesn't quite do that, but all in all I would recommend it. Love Javier Bardem.",1292630400,,732,4.511278195488722

The truth is, I'm not a big Julia Roberts fan. Heck I'd rather watch an Eric Roberts film (even Sharktopus is better than this) than sit through this again.

4065283,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"I guess there is a spoiler in my review but I don't really know any way around it to get across what I'd like to convey. Sorry about that. I usually don't put them in my reviews.

Every since I saw the cardboard standup at the movie theater, I wanted to see EAT PRAY LOVE. I didn't make to the theater when it was out and waited patiently in hopes that my local library would get it in. And they did. I waited three weeks on a waiting list and when I got the call it was my turn, I went in to pick it up immediately and planned to watch it that night.

I must say I was a bit disappointed in this movie. I was really expecting something profound.  Yet as often as the case, I heard the book was really good by a few people. Still, having watched the movie I can't say I'm eager to read it. A positive note, the acting was good.

I for one am a deeply committed person, so right off the bat the main character leaving her husband the way she did, didn't sit well with me. As the story unfolded, I kept waiting for something, something that never happened.

The flashbacks of her husband put in my mind she'd come to her senses and discover she really did love him, and needed to give her marriage the work, commitment and chance every marriage deserves. It bothered me greatly that it never materialized.

I totally get that people often make the wrong decision, and that one needs to discover who they are, their purpose in life and all that. In EAT PRAY LOVE, honestly, the only connection to the title I came away with is EAT. She did indulge in eating. As far as PRAY, I was thrown for a loop on the whole praying thing. As a Christian, did I miss something? Or was the PRAY part, praying to a picture of a woman. That was a little disturbing to me to say the least. As far as LOVE, well yeah, she quickly went from one guy to another with a hint of LOVE. Is it me or did she basically jump into another relationship like she confessed she had from the marriage she'd just ran away from?

So in the end I was sorely disappointed in this movie. I felt the title was misleading, leading you down a path far from what the title suggested.

Apparently the zenith of life for the modern woman is to travel to Italy, make some local friends there and pay for these enormous meals, later travel to Bali where a quack shaman type prophesied she would get married again and try to hitch the man of her dreams.

We meet that amazing individual and before we even know what hit us we have suddenly disappeared inside of a serious relationship.  We disappear because we have begun to neglect our friends, our professional business, our family and often times even our health.  Ladies, think about your last long term relationship?  How did it affect your weight?  I know for me, I tend to gain ten to forty extra pounds when I settle down because we spend so much time eating and laying around enjoying each others company that any focus on fitness seems to fly out of the window. Ultimately, we get to a point where we struggle to find a balance between the love and living a healthy and productive life as an individual.

 I've always had a hard time with this, but I came to realize that much of the problem was that I hadn't taken a good enough amount of time to know, love and commit to myself.  As a result, it was easy to pour all of my love into someone else.  Now that I have taken the time to love me first, I've found that I love others in a far more health way.  Even still, a new challenge has risen to the surface.  In an effort to avoid backtracking or resorting to my old ways, I found myself avoiding relationships altogether.  I tried to convince myself that I just wanted to be single so that I wouldn't risk falling into that same unbalanced pattern again.  Just when all of these jumbled and confusing thoughts threatened to overwhelm and consume me, I took a break from my hectic existence to watch the movie, ""Eat Pray Love.""

In the movie, based on the book by the same name, a woman my age finds herself in the midst of a marriage and a life that is no longer fulfilling. In an attempt to find her joy, she leaves all that she knows for a year and takes a journey of self-discovery.  On that journey she focuses on learning and loving herself by placing herself in new environments with new people and spending a lot of time in prayer and meditation.  As she nears the end of her journey, love finds her and initially she runs from it feeling that it might cause her to lose that balance that she worked so hard to attain.

Just when she is prepared to walk away from the love, a wise teacher that she met along the way reminds her that ""losing balance for love is a part of living a balanced life."" In all of our struggles to get it all right and to have it all figured out,... let's not lose sight of what's really important...Love.

In work and play, I know how the world works, but I am always willing and eager to learn more. That said, EAT PRAY LOVE is a movie and adaptation you will either get or you don't. Either you enjoy it and appreciate it or you don't. And I am ok with that. Every movie is subjective to the viewer. With this film, it will either touch you deeply or disgust you. Let's start with touching.

Not everyone is lucky enough to have experienced the pain Liz does (Julia Roberts). I say lucky because in order to grow, you must feel pain I believe. And while some people found Roberts' portrayal of Liz Gilbert trite and shallow, I found it deeply moving and an effort I could relate to. For two and a half hours, I was removed from my living room and moved along the journey of Liz through Julia Roberts. She WAS Liz and even as an actor, I think Julia Roberts was showing she is still learning about the world around her. I found her pain and sorrow and eventual growth very real. Call me what you wish, but no film needs to follow a standard formula to appeal to the masses. EAT PRAY LOVE is an interpretation of the artist and this film clicks on all cylinders.

As for the disgusting part that some people label the entire film, I think perhaps they expect too much from movies and actors. To jettison the world around you as you sit in a movie theater or living room takes a talent many don't have. The message of this film and its characters is to let yourself go and create an open minded approach and view to the world around you and the world within you. Not everyone can do that and I am ok with that too. But call it what you will, EAT PRAY LOVE is an adoring look at one person's life among many. You will feel the energy and beauty of it or you won't. I applaud the filmmakers and actors for an escape that even men can, not should, appreciate. It's not just a chick flick, it's a snapshot of one person's life that is far from shallow. It is a moving journey indeed.",1291420800,12,2085,4.197007481296758
4065296,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"I remember turning on ""Oprah"" when Liz Gilbert was on a few years back discussing the book version of Eat Pray Love. I could stomach about 10 minutes of her whining about how her privileged, upper-middle-class lifestyle just wasn't fulfilling her and how she had to give it up for a year to find herself. She had a good husband, she had a good job, she had a new home that she decorated just the way she wanted it, and yet, dang it all, it just wasn't quite enough. Why is that? Why is that? Ah, yes. Because she's selfish. And how cool is it that her lifestyle afforded her the luxury of finding herself during a year of travel to exotic places. Why, we all should do it. What the heck are we waiting for?

I can recall that at the end of this ""Oprah,"" Liz was telling us that we can all have our own ""Eat Pray Love"" moment, even if it's just a ten-minute break in a quiet corner of our bedroom, away from the chaos of the kids, work, husband, and the bills. I don't know about you, but taking a break while sitting for ten minutes in a friggin' chair with the door locked while my sticky-fingered kids are pounding on said door, wondering why Mommy locked herself in her room, isn't quite the same thing as taking a year off of my life to travel to three exotic places most of us can only read about. Maybe it is the same, because enlightened Liz says so and she seems to have all the answers.

Julia Roberts, I believe, tried to make Liz appealing/relatable, but who can relate to a woman like this? I mean, who can walk away from her marriage because her husband's, what, simply a nice guy with not enough ambition to satisfy her needs? Who can relate to a person who has the luxury of dropping out of life for a year to travel to Italy, India, and Bali? Who can relate to a woman who turns down a guy like James Franco (I know he was supposed to be a younger man, but I found Franco and Roberts to be a way awkward couple) or Javier Bardem (come on now).

And what is it that makes Eastern religions so much more mystical and alluring to people looking to ""find themselves"" than, say, Christianity or Judaism? (I guess calling it ""meditating"" instead of ""praying"" is the key.)

Well, there are some pluses to this film. The cinematography of Italy is a big plus. (India apparently is too harsh a reality to photograph much of, so all we see are interior shots and an occasional cow near a squatting boy--I guess this is supposed to symbolize the country's poverty, which is ignored throughout the film.)

The main character's selfishness comes out more as well.  By the title and plot of the movie, you would think the main character is out to find herself by losing herself in other cultures and finding solice in spirituality.  But in reality, she is on a vojage to Neverland to escape her problems like a teenager fleeing impending responsibility.  The movie portrays the irresponsible side even stronger, which makes the character completely unrelatable.  All the parts of the book where the character somehow makes progress to ""find herself"" and has moments of spiritual progress have been cut out of the movie.

4065299,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"I have been to India, and I was happy to see that in this movie they actually showed the beggar children that will surround you and some of the garbage problems, most movies about India doesn't show that part. Good Job.

I grew up somewhat poor; when all my school friends played or did their homework, I had to cut wood, carry wood, pick weeds etc etc. I received work boots as the only Christmas gift and work gloves for my birthday. I had to wear my older brother's used clothes. We couldn't afford to turn on the heat in my room, it was around 50 degrees in my room in the winter.

Since when is it wrong to follow your heart? This movie is about following your heart, not self indulgence. She is not following every whim and desire, she is trying to do the right thing by following her heart. Your heart truly knows what's right and wrong. And that power comes from within you, not outside. Is that scary and/or dangerous to some people?

Before you can help anyone else, you have to help yourself, that is not self indulgent, it's called common sense.

She collected 18k for that lady who had gone through such hard times, selfish??

Blaming this movie for your personal problems doesn't make sense to me. If you have all this time dissing this movie and are so unhappy in your personal life, couldn't you do something more useful with your time, energy and money?

When I was growing up I never even had any money to go to the movies, we never had a VCR either. I grew up in the 70's and 80's. You have money and time to spend on movies, and you're poor?

I've also been through some traumatic experiences in my life. To keep on being reminded that I have the power to steer my thoughts in any direction I choose is great and empowering. When you have been through a trauma, memories of the bad experience keeps coming back, and you might feel helpless sometimes. It is not a new concept to me, but it felt great being reminded of that I truly have the power to change that.

Thank you guys for making an awesome movie. Made me feel  a bunch happier and lighter :)",1291248000,7,2071,4.303341902313624
4065300,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"I can't really add anything to the growing list of observations made by the mostly exasperated viewers of this film. A day after I watched this self-indulgent b.s., for some reason the movie Silkwood popped into my head, and I longed to see Cher sitting on that porch swing, giving the performance of a life time as Dolly Polliker. The observations of a poor lesbian in Texas may not sound like something that would present a transformational moment, but it moved me to tears; something that this movie could only hope to aspire to do in its dreams. If you want to wash away the memory of his disappointing performance in E.P.L., I suggest that you re-watch Milk to remind yourself of what tenderness James Franco is capable of portraying. Richard Jenkins gives the only authentic performance in this movie- not sure if it's worth slogging through an hour and twenty minutes to get to, but it's definitely the most moving part. If you want to go on a journey of real forgiveness and redemption try Big Fish. Billy Crudup,(the much- maligned caricature of a husband) gets a chance to shed the years of animosity he's felt towards his father by taking a trip through the fantastic stories he's spun over the years, in the hopes of de-bunking them all, only to discover that there's a grain of truth in every one.

There is not enough time in the movie to fully define each character and I think Liz does that very well in the book.

An intelligent, educated, wealthy woman seeks answers to life's questions from toothless sages in impoverished countries. Am I missing something here?

4065304,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"I read the book when it came out, and just watched the movie. I enjoyed it. The very first words spoken by the lead character, Julia Roberts, are about a friend of hers who was called upon, as a psychologist, to aid Cambodian refugees in dealing with their feelings about the many trials they have gone through. Surprisingly, it seemed, they mostly wanted to discuss their men/women relationship issues. From there the story proceeds about her quest to sort out her relationship issues, mostly by developing a relationship with herself, something that she never really noticed was underdevoloped, mostly because since 15 yrs. of age she had either been super involved in maintaining a relationship with a man, or ending one so she could start anew with another.

There are films that deal with weighty issues. This is one about a woman who wants to redirect her life, so that she doesn't define it so much by other people and external trappings. She will not become a Saint. I don't think she wants to be one anyway. She won't change the world (but she does give a woman some money toward the building of a house she needs). Because of these things, I found the movie to be one that I think many people can relate to. If she had made incredible changes in many, many lives, she would be a great person, for sure, but not someone that so many can relate with - someone whose identity invariably become lost once in a relationship with someone else.

She visits some exotic locations. I would have enjoyed seeing some more scenic shots. I thought the tempo of the movie was great. Some might think it slow, but it seems European with its pace, and since the film is about her travels - it seemed fitting.

Some of the spoken parts from Julia (Elizabeth) are word for word from the book. The way the author arranged her words is quite amazing, and worth reading or hearing spoken. Elizabeth Gilbert is a very talented author. Her book is a book about a woman on a quest to better herself, she is indulging herself with this, so yes, it is self-indulgent. If one is looking to watch a film about something other than self-indulgence, I would say to just watch something different.",1290902400,4,2176,4.5886889460154245

As far as movie-making goes? Predictable and pure Hollywood-style suck the life out of any storyline this may have originally had"" Pure smarm-horrible editing, ridiculous vignettes depicting characters ""thinking"", ""contemplating""...
Julia Roberts seems to have a constant tear in her eye-so much faux ""deep thinking"" and reflection. UGH.
When the tears do fall, it is insincere, boring. Get ready to roll your eyes. When she decides to leave for a year...I almost wished the movie would just end there and we could all wave from the driveway.
The only positive thing...if there is one, about this movie...is that it was less than a dollar (putting the price point slightly above what we all should pay for this-free.)
I knew I was in for trouble in the opening scene when Julia Roberts's Eeyore-style narration, coupled with her riding a bike through one of her mid-life stay-cation destinations, that this movie was going to be just. plain. BAD.
In that regard, it didn't disappoint-the ""bad"" was a thread throughout the entire film, with several horrible crescendos involving her life decisions and advice from friends, flashbacks, dances with people that weren't really there...and more narration.
SO ridiculous.
Ok, granted, I have not read the book-but who cares?
A movie should stand on its own.
""Bridget Jones's Diary"" certainly did what this movie could have done in terms of getting the best out of a book and creating for it a unique film version; even ""Stepmom"", which is, in my opinion, Julia Roberts finest hour, delivers this way-and it was also a good movie to boot.
Rent those!
Yes...
put on pajamas and drink tea and reflect on why 99% of us could never afford to drop out of life and buy homes all over the world, replete with bike basket and poorly-chosen soundtrack a la Pearl Jam?!
Oh, come on.
Someone needs to take Oprah out for lunch and introduce her to some real books-great stories, and beg her to stop giving a hand to the drivel that has turned into what people are calling a...(wait for it) phenomenon.

4065310,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"Julia Roberts returns to the screen in the much anticipated adaption of Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir ""Eat, Pray, Love."" No doubt this film will bring in many viewers due to the high-grossing memoir and what has been come to be called the Oprah effect. Oprah Winfrey has devoted TV shows to the book (one of her book club's selections) and recently a show was aired featuring Julia Roberts.

Julia, as Elizabeth Gilbert, is thirty-something, married and working in New York as a writer. She comes to the realization that she feels nothing for the life she has created and her marriage ends. After a messy divorce and another failed relationship, Elizabeth embarks on a year round trip to Italy, India and Bali.

In Italy, Elizabeth finds friendship and discovers how to relax and enjoy life. In India, her quest becomes more spiritual and she befriends Richard from Texas, played by Richard Jenkins. By example, Richard helps Elizabeth find forgiveness in herself. In Bali, she continues her spiritual pursuit while trying to find balance in life. Elizabeth becomes smitten with a Brazilian, played by Javier Bardem, and must decide if she can maintain her own individuality while falling in love.

The story line is well written by Ryan Murphy (of Glee Fame) and Jennifer Salt and the acting is top notch as it should be with such a gifted cast. This will become a highly regarded film for Roberts, although not to the degree as her Oscar-winning portrayal of ""Erin Brockovich."" If any actors are noticed during award season, Richard Jenkins and Javier Bardem may have to compete with each other for supporting nods. The movie is beautifully film by Cinematographer Robert Richardson and will be a delight for anyone starved for beautiful scenery.

Yes, this film could be classified as a chick film, but the lessons of a life well lived make the film more than just a nice interlude. It is a thoughtful film with messages that are deeper than any chick flick could ever hope to produce. This film will speak to anyone that has found times when they were in need of nourishment, inspiration and love.

""Eat Pray Love"" is rated PG-13 and has a run time of 2 hrs. and 13 minutes

4065311,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"Let me preface this by mentioning I haven't read the book, though I've been meaning to, and after seeing the film first, I can only hope the book form is better. As a travel buff, I've been looking forward to watching this film, and I knew from the get-go that this would be a film about a woman's ennui and unfulfilled life. Yes, I know, first world problems--cue roll of the eyes. But I think many people can relate to the emptiness that pervades life on occasion.

That being said, even as someone sympathetic to this kind of plight, I found the character Liz to be utterly insufferable and a practically impossible woman to relate to. The film has Liz, lying in bed with her husband, looking bored and lonely. She gets out of the bed she shares with her husband to go downstairs to literally kneel down and ask for God's help for the first time, sobbing in the room of her multi-million dollar home. The problem with this entire premise is that her emptiness isn't presented in a way that is relatable to the audience. With film, the exercise is to convey what is inside by external means; the audience cannot magically divine what is going on with the characters. I understand what the INTENT was: her husband doesn't have the travel bug; her husband has ideas but doesn't stick to a single one to make it his passion; her husband doesn't share her curiosity of life, an inclination for what is MORE; she has it all but is still unsatisfied--there's no spark, no excitement. But for me these were not conveyed convincingly. Instead, we have Julia Roberts (playing Julia Roberts) crying, staring at the wall, yelling, acting like an overgrown brat with an alarming sense of entitlement. She purports to look within, but she doesn't. She turns her rage to those around her, and that's a fatal flaw in the film from which it never recovers.

The premise is very promising and intriguing: woman with all the trappings of life searches for more meaning in life by empowering herself--after all, it is often touted that money cannot buy happiness, and there are situations in real life where people who don't have much are happier than those with a lot (more money, more problems). Depression, for example, doesn't skip a person just because he or she is wealthy. Money and material goods are clearly not guaranteed keys to happiness and fulfillment. But instead of taking the opportunity to lay that foundation and build upon this premise, the filmmakers seem to skip it altogether in favor of pretty travel shots, apparently unable to take on the storytelling task. Is it difficult, especially in this economy, to make a film about the dissatisfaction and existential angst of a well-off woman? Yes. But it is not impossible, and if they are going to make a film based on this premise, they better well try to sway the audience. Unfortunately, they seem to just rely on Julia Roberts' ""America's Sweetheart"" status to replace effective narrative. The idea itself is interesting; the execution is the problem (most people can relate to the experience of seeing a fantastic trailer for a film or reading a film summary and getting excited, only to be disappointed after seeing the actual film).

In a meeting with the lawyers and her husband, Liz glares at her husband with the fire of a thousand suns, resenting him for being, well, him. Rightfully, her husband frustratingly informs her that she never sat him down to tell him what's wrong, never gave him a chance to try to fix it if she had such a problem in the marriage. The audience really only sees what ANNOYS her (e.g., he wants to do a postgraduate degree, he doesn't want to go to Aruba). Are these ""flaws"" big enough for her to just walk out one day? At least this warrants a serious sit-down talk about each of their goals and feelings, right? No. Liz doesn't feel connected to him, and instead of sitting down like adults, she decides to leave, cold turkey, because if you don't get what you want out of life, the lesson is you must drop all your problems and run. It is understandable for someone to want to end a marriage if she is unhappy, but to just cut it off abruptly without a serious discussion (and assuming abuse or infidelity haven't occurred, which, in this film, they haven't) is unreasonable and paints the person as a spoiled brat who never learned how to navigate life in an adult world. This is a bad start to a film...an unsympathetic protagonist. Oh, God, how many more minutes do we have to spend with this woman? Did she really just leave her husband because some medicine man in Bali six months before told her one of her marriages would be short? Really? How gullible are you, Liz? The filmmaker really missed out on capitalizing on one genuine moment in the film -- her husband, in the elevator after the meeting with the lawyers, looking truly broken by his wife's abrupt abandonment. Do we get to explore her need to do this in spite of her husband's deep love for her? No, we get Liz's three-second look at his broken figure before she decides to run abroad an cavort with strangers who are meant to fix all her problems.

Throughout the film, Liz makes no real decisions; rather, she allows others to do the thinking for her, which makes for tiresome viewing. The writing and direction are aimless and sloppy. Far too much of the film is spent on her romance with a struggling actor, David (James Franco), who is more of a caricature than someone along the road who truly enlightens Liz and helps her on her journey. He's young. He's handsome. He follows an Indian guru (shrine adorning his apartment), sounds like a fortune cookie, and is a complete poser. He states he has never been to India, but he wants to one day, and spends his day looking sexily forlorn, a tortured soul, when, in fact, he's just like those wannabe Goths who shop at Hot Topic (except he's the hippie version). One day, he wakes up to find half of his bed empty. Where's Liz? She has moved herself to the floor beside the bed, looking like someone just killed her puppy. Again, she doesn't talk about the problem. She just moved her bed to the floor like a petulant child because, again, as with her husband, she's unfulfilled and wants to break up for no discernible reason. Okay, maybe Prozac is in order?

We are meant to take away from this romance the idea that David inspired Liz's trip to India. After all, she never would have known about that guru if it weren't for this poser. Get it, audience? Each person she meets is like a clue to the next spot on the treasure map. Get it? Except the character of David is so hastily written and lazily portrayed that the impact of his influence is negligible (seriously, James Franco looked like he phoned-in his scenes, and even he admitted that he knows the film is terrible and that he only did this film to have the experience of working with Julia Roberts).

The Italy chapter of the film is the most enjoyable, simply because it plays like a fun travelogue -- food porn, fun people, pretty sights. Here, we get a little break from Liz's overbearing personality. We meet some other characters who welcome Liz with open arms, and there are beautiful shots of quaint cafes and restaurants, plates of delicious food, and beautiful cityscapes. For once, we get to see Liz just ENJOYING herself without lashing out, and for a moment the audience can forget Liz as Liz; she's just an American enjoying Italy like any tourist would, looking at Italy with new eyes.

I expected the film to escalate and become even more profound as we head to India, but the narrative takes a serious and boring dip here. You know all the foodcentric tie-ins in the promotion of this movie? It ends with Italy, and it is understandable, seeing that Italy is the ""eat"" of the triumvirate, but since the spirituality aspects of India and Bali are so clumsily portrayed that one cannot help but feel cheated by the rest of the film. Okay, if we can't have genuine spirituality, at least show how decadent the other places are. There's more to India and Bali than ashrams and huts. It's as if the writers and filmmaker didn't know what to do about India. ""Hm, what's India known for? Gods! And poor people. Okay, this part of the film will be about Gods and poor people. It'll be like a spiritual thang."" So we have Liz living in an ashram, cleaning and doing practically nothing, and this is where she meets a Texan named Richard, played by the amazing Richard Jenkins, the highlight of the film. Though his character is paper-thin, Jenkins is so gifted and nuanced in his acting that he's able to flesh out a full character out of practically nothing. He's like your favorite uncle who wise-cracks and kicks you in the seat of your pants once in a while to set you straight. It is too bad that his character disappears rather quickly, which deflates the rest of the film. The writers try to flesh out India by introducing a 17-year-old girl forced into an arranged marriage (a heavy-handed parallel to Liz's own marriage, complete with flashbacks), but by then it is too late. Chapter 2 is already dead in the water. There's no spiritual enlightenment, just a disrespectful fast food approach to prayer and meditation. You just sit quietly, cross your legs, close your eyes, and spread your arms out. That's all, folks.

The film then skips abruptly to Bali, as if it did all it could do in India. Here we have the return of the toothless guru, who, like the Franco character, speaks like a fortune cookie and appears more like a stereotype more than anything else. Liz refers to him as ""Yoda."" He's quirky, speaks with an accent, wears a sarong, and reads your palm...OF COURSE he's enlightened! He's from Bali! He's infused with magic! All the houses have no walls. It's really weird here! When the quirkiness of Bali runs thin, it's time to introduce Felipe (Javier Bardem), an affectionate grizzly bear of a man who kisses his son on the mouth and cries at the drop of a hat. He's not American! He's Brazilian! Passionate! That's what Liz needs! But after his profession of his love, Liz immediately pulls away and starts screaming at him, feeling suffocated. Really, Liz? It's his fault for falling in love and cramping your style? How dare he say it! He's supposed to be passionate -- but to a point, to some invisible marker that Liz draws in the air. Here, Liz comes off as bipolar, running hot and cold at the drop of a hat without rhyme or reason; she is angry at anyone who doesn't read your mind. At this point, the film suffers even more because it is unclear to the audience WHY he's in love with her. He professes to be madly in love with Liz, but it's a head-scratcher why because we do not see her as very lovable at all. She's a screeching banshee of a woman who doesn't seem to be aware of her own motivations, so the relationship itself seems forced, and, by this time in the film, it is too late to build this relationship up as The Relationship in the entire film (yet it is, to the detriment of the narrative; it wasted far too much time with David before introducing Felipe late in the game). She runs away, but one last minute trip to the all-knowing toothless guru, who tells her to open her heart, magically clicks in her head (despite people saying this throughout the film), and she runs back to Felipe and they live happily ever after. Instead of giving any of the foreign characters some real depth, the film paints them in broad stereotypical strokes.

The film never recovers from its biggest malaise: Liz is not sympathetic or relatable. We The Audience watch her cry, look empty, wander, and we can imagine what that's like from drawing on our own lives, but we do not FEEL for her because she isn't even active in her own life. Throughout the film, she is passive (funny, considering all the traveling she decides to do), but in every scene she doesn't seem to help herself, and feels like it is life's duty to provide others who will help her out of her slump. Liz begins the film financially comfortable, with an enviable job, a nice husband, a gorgeous home, and loving friends and family -- it will take some good strong storytelling to convince the audience why she feels unsatisfied. But the director and writers rely too much on the audience just being able to GET IT so the film can skip off to the three countries for the pretty shots. There is no compelling scene that shows Liz and her husband's true unfixable disconnect. We're just supposed to accept there is one from Liz's tears and blank stares at the wall and move on. There's nothing at all that convinces the audience that this gilded cage is suffocating; if anything, we understand Liz as a woman who just needs a good therapist and some volunteer work around the corner (but no, the film seems to say...you can't volunteer at home; you must have a profound experience with poor people abroad). The shot at the end of her ex-husband with a baby and new wife, strolling happily down the street, is meant to show the audience that Liz was right all along, that they were never meant to be, but it feels false and tacked-on instead of true vindication. The problem is, most people in the audience don't have the luxury of taking a year off to vacation in three countries to find themselves, so if you are going to make a film about an unfulfilled woman who CAN do all of this (and a film with merchandise tie-ins that include BUDDHIST prayer beads), it  would be nice for the filmmakers to make the point that happiness doesn't merely lie in stamps in your passport; rather, it's a journey you can take at home. You can meet wonderful people at your corner coffee shop and develop meaningful friendships. You can volunteer at a local shelter and find purpose. If you stopped enjoying food, you can find new recipes or cuisines to try. Unfortunately, the film clearly pushes the idea that for Liz, her existing family and friends aren't enough; she feels an ashram or guru (both stereotyped in the film) is the secret of finding herself; and she even proclaims that the food in her current area doesn't do it for her anymore. The whole film reads like a commercial for the travel industry more than an illuminating lesson of a woman at a crossroads in her life that each audience member can apply to his or her own life. If you want to make a film about a woman who is empowered by dropping it all to find more meaning out of life (and more power to her for doing that), great; it'd just be a lot more effective sans the cultural appropriation (the East is so mystical and weird!) and commercialization. For example,  take the $36 Eat Pray Love Lancome lip glosses, one of the many official merchandise tie-ins). It's kind of incongruent to market a film about materialism not buying happiness by selling lipglosses.

In short, the film is like one of those gimmicky Zen boxes you see by the registers at Borders: watered-down to non-existence and insulting.",1290643200,370,14956,4.586915887850467
4065312,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"There are many mixed reactions to both the popular book EAT LOVE PRAY by Elizabeth Gilbert and the cinematic transcription by Jennifer Salt and director Ryan Murphy - from adoration to loathing. And exploring the reasons for this spectrum probably would result in a hint as to how far in life's journey each responder has gone.  The general theme of the fallout from sustaining a broken heart and being the perpetrator of breaking a heart makes for a thoughtful discussion on where we are in our ability to form lasting relationships today. The movie may be awash in color and overwhelm the viewer with National Geographic-like splendors of the world, but at the fore of the film is a little tale that deserves telling - or at least thinking about.

Writer Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) sees what is lacking in her early marriage to Stephen (Billy Crudup) and realizes as a couple they have grown apart.  She tells Stephen quite frankly that the marriage is over - leaving a broken heart in Stephen.  Liz's editor Delia (Viola Davis) supports Liz's sense of being lost and encourages her to follow her instincts and set out to see the world and in the process to find herself.  After a ricochet romance with young actor David Piccolo (James Franco) who is a free spirit and introduces Liz to meditation, Liz gathers her courage and sets off to see the world.  She visits Bali, meets healer Ketut (Hadi Subiyanto), who encourages her to deal with her inner self and follow her heart.  Liz is off to Rome where she discovers the secret of simply relaxing to enjoy being alive - while she consumes plentiful Italian cooking! - and engages an Italian language teacher Giovanni (Luca Argentero) and a mutual friend Sofi (Tuva Novotny) and in time absorbs the sense of family and unconditional love and the beauty and gestural language of Italy.  She then travels to India where she joins an ashram to concentrate on meditation and makes friends with a young girl Tulsi (Rushita Singh) who is facing a forced marriage (Liz offers her advice that marriage is what you make it), and a Texan Richard (Richard Jenkins, offering the strongest performance in the film) who ultimately shares his sad past of broken hearts with Liz as they bond. Liz then is off to Bali to see Ketut again and discovers Felipe (Javier Bardem) who is likewise distancing himself from a ruined marriage but retains a close love for his children.  It is this final coming together of two souls with similar needs who form the ending of the story.

Yes, the story tugs at the heartstrings at bit heavily but perhaps being a little more vulnerable to the ideas about which this book/film speak is what we all need more than chat room cold distancing.  The cinematography by Robert Richardson is lushly colorful and the original music score by Dario Marianelli enhances each step of the film's journey.  The cast is well chosen, even in the small roles (one would expect only the best from the all star cast assembled), and the direction keeps the at times confusing back and forth process of storytelling fluid.  Maybe it is the approaching season that makes this film feel warm, but that is really OK.  Grady Harp, November 10",1290643200,2,3189,4.7328519855595665

After 12 minutes in my daughter and I already wanted to turn it off.  And just over and hour we couldn't take it anymore.

the main character saving herself.
While it is about breaks ups, it is also about her finding herself

she needs to figure out who she is.

In the beginning we are introduced to a woman who is having a perpetual life crisis. Never being happy or finding her hearts content. Common story for just about EVERYBODY I KNOW. How they went about resolving her dilemma was just not that interesting. Her trip to Italy was relatively uneventful and the lesson to gain from it was to eat what you want and buy bigger pants. Basically, we got that from the watching previews. Then in India, she didn't find anything beyond that either.

I was hoping for her to find some degree of benefit from each location, putting it all together in the end to become a whole, happy person. None of this actually happened.

The last trek to Bali was when it got interesting and is the ONLY reason I give this movie three stars. The adventure and love story there was filled with interesting characters that finally made the movie more interesting than watching paint dry. Javier Bardem really brought something into the movie that simply didn't exist before. He played a great character and his acting was done very well. I liked this entire segment. If only the entire movie would have been like the last third.

Rent it. Then decide if it is worth it. I see some people felt it was worth five stars. I envy them. I just can't live in that world. If you want to really enjoy a great ""Finding Myself"" chick flick, get ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" instead.",1290556800,3,1637,4.483221476510067

4065320,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"You know, any schlub who has been to at least two world's fairs and a rodeo could have saved the protagonist of this film a lot of time and trouble by quoting Buckaroo Banzai's favorite adage:

Wherever you go, there you are.

Unfortunately for the audience, it takes the globe-trotting heroine of Ryan Murphy's film adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir ""Eat Pray Love"" 133 minutes to reach that same conclusion (OK, so it took Tyrone Power 145 minutes in ""The Razor's Edge""...but who's counting?)

Julia Roberts stars as Gilbert's avatar in the film, where she is briefly introduced to us as a (seemingly) happy, thirty-something NYC-based writer with a loving and supporting husband (Billy Crudup). I say ""briefly introduced"", because soon after a research trip to Bali, during the course of which a shaman (Hadi Subiyanto) foretells that she will lose all her money, but eventually return to study under him so that he may impart his great wisdom, Liz decides that she needs to bolt from the marriage (much to the puzzlement of husband and audience).

While the ink is still drying on her divorce papers (at least in screen time), Liz tumbles headlong into a relationship with a hunky young off-off Broadway stage actor (James Franco). The lust, however, soon turns to wanderlust, and Liz decides that maybe what she really needs is to take a year off from...everything. So, leaving her new relationship somewhere in the neutral zone, she embarks on a three-pronged attack in order to ""find herself"", first to Italy (eat), then India (pray) and then Bali (love...oops, is that a spoiler?)

So what does she learn? Want the speed-dating version? Here goes! In Italy, they have like, killer pasta and pizza. Awesome! And the gelato...it's to die for! Oh...and Italians live in the moment, and they talk with their hands...just like the people on Jersey Shore! And when Liz decides to treat her new Italian friends to an all-American style home-cooked Thanksgiving meal with all the trimmings, one of the Italians, being unfamiliar with our ways and customs, forgets to defrost the bird. But, not to worry-Liz puts it in the oven, they all go to bed, and then, they have turkey for breakfast. How whimsical! Next stop: India, where Liz learns piety by scrubbing floors at an ashram. Oh, and gurus live in the moment. Then, it's back to Bali, where she goes back to the shaman who started the whole thing (he lives in the moment). Then, she meets a sexy Brazilian! (Javier Bardem).

Roberts is suitably radiant, flashes her million dollar smile and delivers her patented hearty guffaws right on cue, but she oddly seems to spend a good portion of this (very long) film as an observer of her character's journey, rather than an active participant. Consequently, it's hard for us to really care about what happens to our leading lady; and that is a fatal flaw. The always wonderful Richard Jenkins (as another American at the ashram) briefly perks up the middle third. But as soon as his character disappears, so does the spirit and energy he brings to the film. The locales are gorgeous, and there's plenty of food porn for the gastronomiques, but that doesn't candy-coat Robert's phoned-in performance and the flat, soap opera-ish dialog (co-written by Murphy and Jennifer Salt). It's like randomly surfing between Lifetime, The Food Network and The Travel Channel.

I have not read the source book, nor frankly am I ever likely to. The Pottery Barn angst on display here is tough to sympathize with in these hard economic times (how many of us can afford the luxury of ""taking a year off"" to navel-gaze?), and seems bent on perpetrating the Ugly American meme. In fact, I thought that the depictions of the ""colorful locals"" encountered by the protagonist on her whistle stops bordered on the kind of colonial stereotyping I assumed Hollywood had abandoned ages ago. You know how they say that ""It's not about the destination, it's about the journey""?  In this case, the trip could not be over soon enough.",1290384000,16,4010,4.878120411160059
4065321,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"once again, as in all her films, you can't get past the fact that it's Julia Roberts playing Julia Roberts and not the character.  The book was so darn good and the movie itself is a great filming experience and all the other actors did a fine job.  If only the audience could forget and not see all of Julia's expressions and mannerisms, the huge mouth and laugh, it would be rated excellent by me.  The Julia cackle has come into every single part she has ever played and when that happens, the viewer is brought out of the film and back to Julia.  We know she has a huge laugh and bigger than normal smile but other actors have an English accent or whatever and they change that for a film and make their characters be the characters.  Julia can't do that or maybe she can and just doesn't.  Every person she plays can't have a cackle in their character, can they???

4065323,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"I agree with one of the reviewers who wrote that some more easily relate to this film than others.  The film puts into words and images one take on midlife.  I wonder if it mirrors/symbolizes Margaret Mahler's stages of development.  Italy for symbiosis as highlighted with the merging with spaghetti scene.  India with separation from other/outer focus to an inward one via learning to meditate and Bali with independence and a return to the world with her stepping back into romantic relationships at a more mutual level.

The Grimm's tale Duration Of Life also comes to mind:  The first thirty years is filled with a zest for life (Italy), the next thirty with grief and inner work (India or in the Grimm's tale:  the donkey and dog years) and the last phase (Bali or ""the monkey years"") with play and a generative contribution to society (a house was built for a healer).

If this movie can be viewed as a metaphorical story for the midlife passage, Robert Bly's words come to mind when he said that fairy tales give us empathy and support to look inward to search for our core beliefs.

On another level, this movie reminded me of Holland's Opus which was said to be a comfort movie for those who didn't realize their dreams - this movie for those who didn't experiecne the level of self fulfillment they would have liked or felt designed to experience.

The scenes with Richard, who ""speaks in bumper stickers,"" seem to serve as an image of a Boomer mentoring an Xer.  A colourful, fun and decent movie.",1289260800,9,1509,4.635338345864661

4065325,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"In 2006, a woman named Elizabeth Gilbert wrote a book called Eat Pray Love: A Woman's Search For Everything Across Italy, India, and Indonesia. This little book depicted her search for balance, and a better life. It was endorsed by the almighty Oprah, and therefore, millions of readers across the country, and across the world have been enlightened by her everywoman approach to spirituality, religion, and what needs to be done to live your best life.

And, four years later, the film version is released. Naturally, Julia Roberts was selected to play the lead role. And, let me start out by saying, I was a huge fan of the book, and Julia Roberts was NOT who I had in mind to play Gilbert. I saw someone like Kate Winslet, or Anne Hathaway in the lead role. I thought that with Roberts playing the lead role, the story would be transferred from a deep, spiritual journey, to just another Julia Roberts movie.

I was pleased to discover that I was wrong in these thoughts. Julia Roberts is a fabulous actress, and like any fabulous actress, she makes you believe that this part couldn't have been played by anybody else. She embodies the role, it's obvious that she spent months, perhaps even a year, getting into character. She is so reminiscent of the Elizabeth Gilbert character. After watching this film, it's clear that she was the obvious choice for the role.

In the film, Liz Gilbert (Roberts) is a seemingly happy married woman. She has everything a modern American woman is supposed to want: husband, beautiful home, great friends, terrific job, etc. She discovers that that's not all it takes to make one happy. She divorces her husband (Billy Crudup), and starts to date an actor (James Franco) from a play that she wrote. She finds a beautiful human connection with him, but realizes that even he's not what she really needs.

She breaks it off with him, quits her job, and decides to take a journey around the world, that would last one full year. This journey would start in Italy, where she would get in touch with her abandoned love for food, then moving to India, where she would find religion, and then to the Indonesian island of Bali, where she would try to find love again.

A colorful array of supporting actors make this film what it is. Viola Davis plays Gilbert's BFF Delia, who is tragically underused, but she is a kind of voice of reason for the wishy-washy emotions of our heroine. Javier Bardem was the obvious choice to play her Indonesian lover Felipe, who has undeniable chemistry with Roberts. Richard Jenkins plays a man who Gilbert meets in India, who acts as sort of a confidante to our main character.

The heart of this film, however, lies in the breathtaking cinematography, and beautiful soundtrack. Director Ryan Murphy, of Glee, and Nip/Tuck fame, treats this better than he did his previous adaptation Running With Scissors. It's directed with love, and it follows the book as well as can be expected. He fits alot of gorgeous architecture, and beauty into the massive scope. Each frame is a postcard, and makes the viewer long to take a journey like this at some point in their life. It also is very resonant on an emotional level. It makes you believe that even the most cynical person can find happiness if they allow themselves to.

In the end, this isn't a romantic comedy. This isn't a chick flick, it isn't even a `Julia Roberts movie', it's a loving adaptation of an admired memoir. It will surely satisfy fans of the book, as well as fans of Julia Roberts. But, you don't need to be a Roberts fan to appreciate what this film has to offer. Its message is universal, beautiful, and breathtaking. See it.",1287964800,6,3658,4.679626749611198

4065328,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"There are two types of people who watch this movie: those who get it, and those who don't.  Those who don't may learn to appreciate it but it will never become a part of their souls.  If movies ever define what a person is going through in life, then this is one of those movies.

Based on the memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert, it follows Gilbert (played wonderfully by Julia Roberts) in her attempt to find herself after her divorce and a failed romance.  She decides to do this by spending the year in Italy (""eat""), India (""pray""), and Bali (""love"").  In each of these regions of the world she rediscovers a part of her that she had lost over the years: in Italy she discovers not just an appetite for food but for life in general; in India she finds her spiritual center while in Bali she learns that she can love again.

This is a simplistic description of the movie, but to go into more detail would simply take too much space.  Chances are if you are female over the age of 40 you may understand where Liz is coming from and learn something from her experience.  Most men might not get it -- a neighbor of mine who saw was utterly clueless about the subtext; I myself did see some of my own journey through life in what Liz went through and ended up seeing the movie three times in the theater (my wife saw it six times).  If you are hardcore in your religious beliefs you may have a problem with her seeking spirituality in a non-Christian/Western setting (in fact, the Vatican itself condemned the movie saying Liz should have stopped eating while in Rome and visited one of the many churches in the Eternal City for spiritual guidance rather than go to India).  But that's the whole point of the movie: Liz needed to find what worked for her, and each part of the film represents a step in that discovery.  Could she have gone into the churches?  Perhaps, but at that point she wasn't ready to find that part of her soul and she didn't need the church to tell her what she HAD to do which, frankly, she got tired of doing throughout much of her life.

Julia Roberts' performance is excellent, and I will be sorely disappointed if she does not earn an Oscar nomination next year for it.  It easily surpasses her work in ""Erin Brockavich"".  The cinematography is excellent, the musical score is uplifting (and it's a shame that only one song from the original score is on the soundtrack album), and the supporting cast is so well that several should be up for their own Oscar noms.  If you're especially interesed in cinematography and acting, pay attention to the scene between Liz and Richard from Texas that takes place on the roof of their ashram in India -- that's all one take without edits.

This isn't a movie to watch.  This is a movie to experience.  This is a movie that wants you to feel something.  I know my wife and I did.  And I've been told watching the film before reading the book makes the book much easier to read.",1286928000,8,2938,4.393715341959335

Director: Ryan Murphy
Writer: Ryan Murphy, Jennifer Salt (Based on the Memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert)
Cast: Julia Roberts, Javier Bardem, James Franco, Viola Davis, Richard Jenkins, Billy Crudup, Tuva Novotny
Year: 2010

A memoir is the exact opposite of a screenplay. A memoir is full of inner monologue, emotion, endless stories that take place over a great amount of time and it's all told in a first person narrative. A screenplay has to be short, concise, pure dialogue and contain very little obvious emotion (thats for the actors to interpret). So when a memoir is chosen to be adapted into a feature film it's quite the challenge. You have to stay true to the events and the person telling them but you also have to work within the constraints that a feature film demands. This is what writer/director Ryan Murphy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Running-With-Scissors/dp/B000M5B98A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Running With Scissors</a>, TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glee-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0032JTV6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glee: The Complete First Season</a>) was faced with on his film ""Eat, Pray, Love.""

Elizabeth Gilbert's classic memoir of self discovery, spirituality and love by traveling to Italy, India and Bali is a wonderful book full of wit, wisdom and meaning that can be appreciated by anyone; though only about 2/3s of that is translated to film. In any adaptation, whether it be novel, comic or memoir, there is one thing that I personally want to see faithfully portrayed: the themes (think Marry Harron's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Psycho-Uncut-Killer-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0009A40ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Psycho (Uncut Killer Collector's Edition)</a>). Of course there are going to be adjustments to the narrative and characters due to the difference of artistic mediums, but thankfully Murphy pulls it off with his film. He is able to find the right balance of addition and subtraction to properly honor the source material yet also create a satisfying stand alone film.

The film beings with Liz (Julia Roberts,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erin-Brockovich/dp/B00003CXFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erin Brockovich</a>) struggling with her unfulfilled life and loveless marriage to Stephen (Billy Crudup,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen-Theatrical-Cut-Widescreen-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B0029NY9YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen (Theatrical Cut) (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)</a>). Divorce proceeds and so does a rocky rebound relationship with David (James Franco,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milk/dp/B001QUF3SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milk</a>). Living an aimless life without passion and against the better judgment of her best friend Delia (Viola Davis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doubt/dp/B001PA0FFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doubt</a>), Liz embarks on a round the world journey to reconnect with pleasure (eat), her spirituality (pray) and self esteem (love). Along the way she meets many 'the wise stranger' (Richard Jenkins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Visitor/dp/B0015OKWKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Visitor</a>; Javier Bardem,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B00118T63C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>) and visits some of the most beautiful places on earth.

Sure, this may sound like a seriously sappy and contrived film, but in all honesty, it's not. Murphy never lets the film dip into melodrama and handles his story with a smooth, confident hand. While he could have taken some of the more edgier parts of the book (ex: Liz's severe depression) to the screen, the movie ends up being cleaner and crisper and all the more fun without it. The picture is meant to inspire the audience to have fun, to connect and to live life, if the darker issues were included the message could have missed the mark. Murphy accomplishes this sense of euphoria visually and ascetically with the help of master cinematographer Robert Richardson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inglourious-Basterds-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B002T9H2LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inglourious Basterds (Single-Disc Edition)</a>). The shots of Italy, India, Bali, and heck, even New York, are so georgous that if you can't afford to take a vacation this year, a ticket to Eat, Pray, Love will do the trick.

What ties the film together is, of course, the luminous Roberts. She is, of course, a bon a fide movie star and this material is something that she can easily use to showcase her talents. She is backed by a terrific and believable supporting cast of Hollywood stars and native Italians, Indians and Balinese actors- all equally great.

""Eat, Pray, Love"" may not be a groundbreaking motion picture, but it's certainly a film that is enjoyable. It engages you emotionally and to me, that is the first and most important thing I look for in any film. It might not be the most faithful adaptation fans of the book were hoping for (and how could it have been?), but on it's own it's a picture with an easy charm and it's a harmless way to spend two and a half hours.

4065333,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"My friend Pati read this book and was bowled away by it, so when my friend Madeleine decided she wanted to see the movie I willingly agreed.  After seeing it, my impression of the movie's message is that ""the meaning of life is guys.""  Wow, what a concept.

The heroine started out the film with a perfectly nice guy, went through a mid-life crisis and dumped him to eat her way through Italy, meditate and scrub floors in India, and find another guy in Bali.  She just came full circle.  It seemed to me she'd have saved herself a whole lot of money--let alone scrubwoman's hands--by simply staying with the first guy.  Oh well, what do I know?

It's not that I didn't understand where she was at; God knows I've done my own world travelling trying to find happiness and meaning, and I've done my own fair share of soul searching in the process.  Heaven knows I've certainly tried finding the meaning of life in one guy or another, but the truth is, there is no meaning of life beyond what you yourself give it.  If guys are your thing, then guys it is.

The fairy princess notion, however, that guys are the ""meaning"" of it all places a huge burden on them, and it's one that no human being can or even should attempt.  It's doomed to failure from the outset, which is probably why so many marriages collapse.  The whole notion of ""happily ever after"" in which people, especially female people, are encouraged to believe is very unstable.  That happy couple in the wedding photo will probably be the grumpy pair arguing over breakfast about some trivial difference of opinion.  Our society's answer to the disappointment is to discard one relationship for another that will be ""better"" than the last.  In the end marriage becomes ""all about me.""  While this makes big bucks for the billion dollar wedding industry, I doubt it does anything for anyone else.  It certainly doesn't help the children sometimes caught up in the discord.

The most important thing that people need to remember is that romance novels rarely have sequels that feature the same lovers.  This is a telling detail.  Once the ""happily ever after"" arises out of the turmoil of frustrated love, the lovers cease to exist for us.  After all, did the movie go on to tell us all about the boring details of the lives of the new ""happy couple?""  Nope.  Unfortunately it's the boring details that constitute most of life.  The couple may cease to be lovers, but they don't ""go on"" as they were before.  Either their relationship matures, or it doesn't and they're both back where they started again.

The most important things I learned in my own odyssey were about me.  I'm still learning them, too, because like most people, I don't really think I need to change.  I just know you can't run away from yourself.  You're always there, where ever it is you go, and you need to learn to live with the person you are no matter where you are!  As the heroine says midway through the movie, ""Ruins are life's way of teaching us something.""  Yup, it's ""live with it!""

By the end of the film I felt like the producers had foisted off another romance movie on me.  I felt that they said, ""Yup. It's all true; all you need to do is find the ""right guy,"" and you'll live happily ever after. And that's the meaning of life.""  How sneaky.",1284163200,6,3294,4.517766497461929
4065334,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"It was a very self-absorbed story and film.  I only stayed until the end, because I wanted to see if this totally selfish, inward person every 'got it'!  I was one of the few who stayed.  People started walking out after about the first half hour and by the time she got to the 'love' portion of the film - the theatre was basically empty.  It was painful to stay until the end.  Was it worth it?  NO.

A person who cannot define themselves without the validation of others, and who moaned and groaned for two and one-half hours?  Unbelievable that someone felt the need to spend millions of dollars to put this into film.  I can only imagine how intermidable it was to try to get through the book.  Again, amazing that this complaining story made it in print!  The only saving grace in the film?  The wonderful scenery and food.  Not enough to redeem this movie; nor good enough for an actress like Julia Roberts.

I read that she is now 'done with Christianity'...well, I guess someone had a revelation!  Although, I might have kept that to myself until the film aired; I suspect that bold statement affected ticket sales, certainly in the US, before the film was released.  I love Julia Roberts, but this was not one of her better moments.

What will lead a person to want to discover this feeling is an intense longing. How this happens for each person is unique and a surprise. Travelling across the world is only one of a wide variety of circumstances. The actors in the story did a good job because I believe that they were able to go little deeper to access their own experiences and feelings about what really matters, and then ""infuse"" the script to make it come alive.",1283817600,3,717,4.790322580645161
4065336,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"I enjoyed this movie, but felt the screenplay was much too long...Julia Roberts exhibits her talented magic, as Liz Gilbert, a journalist who is spiritually and emotionally bereft. Roberts does a great job with capturing a confused, control freak, who is uncertain, generous in spirit, affable and vulnerable. Emerging from an ill matched marriage, to dating a more spiritually enlightened boy toy....Liz recognizes there is more to life and something very wrong with the men she chooses. So...with the amicable encouragement of her friends, she sets out to do something different! Viola Davis is very likeable as her BFF, a juggler supreme (super busy) life chaotically wonderful, supportive and self confident friendship. Liz makes an unexpected proposal to take a sabbatical from her normal life and journals her adventures along the way.

The script was good, the cinematography great, and the director captured the essence of the woman and her companions. But the film was contradictory and just about 30 minutes too long. To say Liz was in an unhappy marriage bothered me...Liz was in an unhappy life (her own) and engages on an outer journey to places of inner discovery. She sets sail for Bali to find her journey's map, then on to Italy where she easily makes friends and revels in the wonders of a culture who is like a relaxed pair of jeans...you know, with the expandable waist? Liz even delivers a lecture on how unhealthy America is to women and their body image (gasp...muffin top stomachs!) She pledges to defy social mores to her newfound Swedish friend...to just ""let go and live"" while in the land of love and culinary delight. The problem is the camera then follows them to a boutique where they painfully, dully, try on several pairs of too tight pants, enduring the torture of having someone help them pull the zipper shut, whilst lying down for maximum flatbelly...ultimately buying another denim corset. It just doesn't compute. I guess I was hoping for more scenes of the history of Rome and more of the amazing food and drink...too much time on spaghetti (uhm, yeah, we have that here in the USA). Found myself wishing i could see the Sistine Chapel and more of the local, delights in bread, cheese, and pasta. Okay, so a letdown with the Italian sequence....the saving grace was the beautiful language and total lack of neuroses in the Italian culture,...at least within the confines of Liz's encounters.

India was my favorite part of the story, it was humorous, capturing both the ruinous filth of the city and its collective devotion to prayer and enlightenment. Liz transcends her privileged, neurotic, monkey chatter thoughts by forming an intimate, platonic bond with another American devotee (played wonderfully by Richard Jenkins), who shares his story and prompts her (sometimes with an emotional cattle prod) to keep walking the inner path. Again though...too much time on watching someone meditate...uhm, hello? Its kind of like watching someone take a nap... not really engaging...unless you are going to throw in special effects. Our Liz was just not experiencing any significant inner plateaus during meditation, so no swirly whirly colors or visions...I would humbly suggest leaving some of this segment on the cutting floor.

Back to Bali for the final installment, where Liz reconnects with her Yoda like shaman,""Ketut,"" who gives her tasks,throwing in niblets of common sense, with an adorable toothless grin and weird accent. To give the story credit, Liz (Julia Roberts) does her best work here....in particular, a scene on the beach where she portrays abject horror at the reality of being alone with the very vulnerable, and sensitive Javier Bardem I(""Felipe"")...a guarded, yet affable divorced gentleman she is growing very close to. Felipe is so diametrically different that he can easily see she is seeking a ""champion,"" instead of the ""boys"" her history involves. Liz resists, of course, in her typical New Yorky stubborness of trying to find something on the exterior to ""fix"" her interior flaws. Many referenced the fortune cookie ending where she runs toward discomfort, risk, uncertainty and another chance at love. This time with someone who brings out the best in her...

All in all, i would suggest this movie as a video rental...the movie theatre involved me eating too much popcorn and milkduds, during the parts that i would have left out. Cutting 30 minutes would have been way cool. Roberts, Jenkins, Bardem....all wonderful, and its admirable when anyone, from any class (even the well heeled upper, elite) takes the path less traveled...",1283817600,,4604,5.094039735099337
4065337,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"The story begins with Liz failing out of two relationships, well aware of how each got the way it was but baffled as to why. So, in order to find herself, she goes looking in places she's never been.

The 'Eat' part of the story take place in Rome, where Liz discovers the wonder of 'dolce far niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing. Except that it's not nothing, it's full involvement in the little things of each moment, and in turning the biological demand for fuel into a kind of making love. The mouth-watering, full-screen shots of pasta, melon, turkey, and more show just what there is to love, including a drumstick moment that approaches the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Jones/dp/B00005AUKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Jones</a>&nbsp;for sensuality. (In truth, this segment of the movie made me ashamed of the bland drink and stale popcorn I had inflicted on myself at the theater's concession stand.)

Since I'm not in the ""chick flick"" demographic, the next two passages didn't do so much for me. Liz's next stop was India, where I hoped the culinary passion would play out among the complex flavors of India's cuisines. Although Liz brought a healthy appetite with her, the 'Eat', 'Pray', and 'Love' segments of the movie didn't overlap, and India marked the transition from 'Eat' to 'Pray'. As in any good spiritual journey, Liz encoutered new teachers during this phase, and not the ones she had expected. For reasons known only to Liz, the time in India came to its end, and she moved on to Bali and 'Love'. I was happy to see that 'Love' took many forms, and not just the mandatory romance.

I'm more of a guy movie kind of guy, but I see my wife's movies almost as often as she sees mine. As estrogenic cinema goes, my taste tolerated this one quite well - but I'd come back to the 'Eat' portion of the movie any time. Four stars: not necessarily because of how it matched my preferences, but because how well it seemed to do what it wanted to.

4065338,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"I was shocked to see that Elizabeth Gilbert's nauseating twaddle, EAT PRAY LOVE was being made into a movie.  Even more shocked to see Julia Roberts in the lead.  But I always enjoyed her comedies, so I was hopeful she might turn the poor excuse for a memoir into a comedic film.  I was so wrong.  The movie just might be even more shallow than the highly-touted-by-Oprah (another reason to avoid the book) supposed ""memoir.""  Italy was sterotypically portrayed (lots of pasta and Italians who don't seem to have a care in the world) India and the ashram were also pretty unbelievable, even Richard Jenkins, a strong character actor, could not redeem that segment, and Bali, where no one's home has walls...really?  Do only ex-pats live in Bali?  Oh, and there is a very unconvincing story awkwardly woven into the movie about a single Balinese mom with a mission to help others for whom Ms. Gilbert supposedly raises a ridiculous amount of money so the woman can build a home with floors covered in little pretty blue tiles.  The only ""real"" moment in the film came when Felipe (Javier Badem) is saying good-bye to his 19-year old son and tearfully tells him that a week together is just not enough time.  Having raised 2 children, I could relate to his pain.  But that was the only authentic part of the movie.  As for the man she visits in Bali, her healer?  who reads her palm? Two of my friends traveled to Bali and actually sought him out.  Guess what?  He told both of them the same thing he told Elizabeth!  ""You will live a long life and have 2 husbands.  The second husband will be your true love/soul mate,"" blah blah blah.  Julia Roberts was boring, she smiled too much, she wept with no tears, she had a wardrobe that would never have fit in that dirty duffel bag she was hauling around and her dialogue had no soul.  But then, neither did Gilbert's book. Even Neil Young's music could not help this film. If you like experiencing someone else's self-indulgent behavior and whining, this movie (and the ""memoir,"" a word I use loosely here) is for you.

From my vantage point on the other side of midlife, I can say that Elizabeth has the same problem a lot of people have, they are in an unhappy relationship and think the problem is the other person. Of course, it never is entirely the other person but usually one doesn't discover this until after the second bad marriage.

Elizabeth chucked everything and went on a journey to herself. If you pay attention to the subtleties of the movie, she begins her enlightenment when it stops being about her and starts being about other people. Richard, who lived up the highway from here until his death recently was certainly a real person and was portrayed in the movie very much like in the book.

The scenes in Bali were spectacular. The miraculous healing potions of Wayan were as described in the book.

When the movie was over, I felt that it was a ""little too neat"" in that some of the angst and agonizing were omitted as side plots and not important to the main story but in the book they were very interesting. My companion (another woman who had not read the book) remarked that she was glad it wasn't a ""love story"". In my opinion it was a love story about learning to love yourself and open yourself up to life. A lesson we all need to be reminded of.

Do yourself a favor, read the book, see the movie, read her next book. Enjoy!",1283040000,152,1449,4.37546468401487
4065341,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"I'm partial to this actress, enjoying the numerous movies in which she's appeared (my favorite being Notting Hill).  Unfortunately, I had to shake my head at this film, after forcing myself not to walk out mid-way.

Perhaps I should have read the book first, and saved myself the trouble of actually seeing the film.

First off, the good points--the photography in the various locales (Bali, Italy, and India) was stunning.  The vibrancy of the photography was brilliant, and to say they were breathtaking would be an understatement.  The story had potential, so I believed, but I was vastly disappointed.  Overall, it drew away from the glamor emitted from the great photography.

Roberts played her role with the same skill she has demonstrated in her other films, reaching to envelop the character with an all-encompassing grace.  Her  male co-stars (Billy Crudup and  James Franco) provided perfect foils to her acting. It was the story line that was lacking.

Centered around her divorce, I understand that this is  a difficult medium for anyone to reach in their lifetime.  Liz Gilbert's journey from her divorce to her self-realization was just a little too much to handle, filled with (what I interpreted) as self-absorption before she reached self-realization.  My belief has always been ""When times get tough, aren't you supposed to pull up your pants and tackle life head-on.  Running away never solves anything.""  That is precisely what the leading lady did when she encountered trying times.

Goodness, wouldn't we all love to go through a trying time in our lives, and manage to jet off to some exotic locale (for a year!)  to get away from it all? Reality is this:  many of us can't afford the escape (financially), nor can we say the hell with everything, and leave it all behind.

I hate to pass out a bad review but, if you're looking for a film with depth,  save your money on this one.  (Please remember, this is simply my opinion)

Go to the movies and see something entertaining, a film that will make you wish you were off in that magical world portrayed on the screen, and not wallowing in intense and heart wrenching despair.",1283040000,10,2150,4.846153846153846

4065343,1,B0033AGJ5Y,"Eat, Pray, Love was, first and foremost, boring.  Nothing happened--no adventure, no enlightenment, no interesting conversations, no revelations, no self-discovery (or discovery of anything else, for that matter).

Second, this movie was trite.  Reminiscent of the ego tripping of the 1960's, it added nothing new to any debate about anything--humanity, nature, individualism, all of these were possible topics.  The movie touched on none of them.

Third, this movie was improbable.  Liz wakes up one morning, deciding (for no ascertainable reason) to dump her husband and go on a year-long odyssey to discover something, or recover something, or whatever.  She apparently has the funds to do this, which should come as a surprise to everyone (including herself) after her divorce.  We certainly never see her worried about money or whether her mail will catch up with her, or how to pay her income taxes or credit card bills.  In Italy, she eats pasta and moans about an increasing weight we certainly never see.  In India, she stays on an ashram that seems to cater to spiritual tourists, but we never see her eating or sick.  She never even gets dirty.  In Bali, she takes on a huge commitment to transcribe ancient Balinese wisdom for a wise man, but abandons this endeavor without warning or excuse to spend three weeks (!) in bed with a handsome and very unusual Brazilian man.  (When did any of you ever meet a gorgeous Brazilian man who was willing to be a househusband?)

Fourth, this movie represented selfishness and hypocrisy at extraordinary levels.  She dumps her husband with no warning, no counseling, nothing.  She goes where she wants and tramples upon whomever she wishes to crush.  Given that she is on a mission of self-indulgence, it is shocking that she works to persuade a 17 year old Indian woman to marry the man her family has chosen for her.  Why isn't this girl entitled to the same freedom that Liz feels is her own right?  She does one thing that might be considered to be outside the solipsistic world she has created:  she writes to her friends to ask them to donate money to a Balinese healer who desperately needs a house.  But even that is staggeringly self-centered:  she bases her request to them on the premise that, if she were in New York, her friends would be throwing a very expensive birthday party for her, to which they would bring expensive bottles of wine as gifts.  What presumption!

In case you have read this far in this review, and in case, having read this far, you don't get the picture, this is a terrible movie.",1282953600,174,2568,4.784090909090909
4065344,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Whether or not ""Eat, Pray, Love"" adequately represents the bestselling memoir of the same name (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eat-Pray-Love-One-Woman-s-Search-for-Everything-Across-Italy-India-and-Indonesia/dp/0143118420/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia</a>) by author Liz Gilbert or not doesn't really matter.  Is it the fault of the filmmaker or the writer when the piece attempts to hit the side-of-the-barn of greater meaning and just barely skims the surface?

""Eat, Pray, Love: the Phenomenon"" recounts the year long journey of writer Liz Gilbert as she recovers from a messy divorce and an unfulfilling affair/relationship with a very 21st century self-absorbed pragmatism that appeals to both aging flower children and their ""look-inward"" progeny.  By combining worldly angst with the spiritual fascination of Eastern religions made fashionable by the Beatles in the 60s, Gilbert attempts to fill many different types of holes in the spirit of self-development simultaneously.  Although she succeeds somewhat in her book, director Ryan Murphy's film stalls when it fails to define itself within a particular genre.  Not that this ambiguity alone causes the film to fail--it ambles along prettily enough but unfortunately without enough thrust to make it stand out as a must-see event.

Murphy/Gilbert's audience contains the wide subset of Oprah Winfrey watchers--those of the ""live your dream"" mantra that desire nothing more than to be able to make a lucrative career out of facilitating something they love.  Gilbert surely fits the bill here: her publisher financed her journey of discovery to three foreign countries where she could eat, pray and love her way to bigger pay check.

Just what Gilbert is fleeing is up for grabs.  Her marriage to Billy Crudup doesn't work and neither does her affair with the young hottie actor (James Delicious Franco)--how sad is that? Neither of these man ask her to sacrifice her livelihood for them--Crudup is depicted as financially dependent on her and Franco blows her off emotionally when he realizes she is looking for him to save her.  As she wanders through the streets of Rome on the first leg of her trek, the audience senses her confusion--is the melancholy of her past preventing her from enjoying the pleasurable sensations of the present and the future?

The juxtaposition of the ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" theme while in Italy--mucho plated food porn, the hum of Vespas and so many leather-clad Italians looking chic in skinny jeans--with the austere loneliness of the Augusteum in Rome to depict the change that the world and time has on one's inner identity marries the desire to splurge with a sad introspection that tries too hard--hinting at depression but not quite spelling it out.  Perhaps knowing that Gilbert actually battled depression with medication may help the audience better understand and relate to the confused emotional shifts through which the main character traverses.

Murphy avoids this descent within the modern mindset for pharmacopia focusing instead for more than half of the film on Gilbert's sojourn at the Indian ashram.  Is he commenting on the fact that the status of being a spiritual seeker is just part of a look at the ersatz intelligentsia--those who emote often and within the boundaries of copious self-development/how-to realms where just living a good life with great companions isn't quite en vogue anymore?  Is he telling us that enlightenment has become the newest and trendiest goal?  In this sense, is it any wonder that the most predominant self-help guru of our time (Oprah Winfrey) has taken Gilbert under her lofty wings and is promoting not only the author's bestselling memoir but also the film and its star, Julia Roberts?  Is he helping to build an ""Eat, Pray, Love"" franchise that advocates taking a long break from reality while attempting to peel away the layers that hide the inner self?

Who knows?

Gilbert's activities at the ashram are never really defined--her inner journey becomes trite and cutesy rather real and mind-boggling.  Whatever conclusion she reaches doesn't really reach the viewer--the audience waits for the ""love"" leg of the triangle because that is how a film as attractive as this with an attractive main character should end--with love.

All this would be very cool if the film defined itself in more universal terms.  As a travelogue, the cinematography lovingly captures the Eternal City, the riotous humanity of Mumbai and the lush jungles of Bali with a glossy expertise that would do both National Geographic and Travel & Leisure proud.  As a romantic fantasy--girl is married to wrong guy, has affair with younger actor and than finds the hunkiest Brazilian ex-pat this side of Ipanema even after gorging herself with indulgent amounts of pizza, pasta and gelato--'EPL' might work.  However, the screenplay makes the mistake of dictating a New Age panacea for the ennui of modern life.  Whereas the average viewer expects a visual nirvana of charming faraway places, he/she is force-fed the not-so-palatable pill of Liz's self-absorption.  The result confuses; the storyline seems over-edited.  The overall messages gleaned from the experiences in the three places don't really flow with any real meaning because even though we are treated to some voiceover, we are not privy to the progression (if any) of Liz's without-rhyme or reason thought as we are in her equally poorly formatted book.  The bulk of the film's time is spent focusing on the routine of the ashram in Ganeshpuri, India where Liz fumbles through meditation, her early morning devotionals and some textbook feminism regarding the woman-unfriendly aspects of marriage.  Why she is there and what she hopes to gain other than to meet the guru of her ex-boyfriend is never fully mapped out.  She snaps with frustration at the gruff Richard from Texas (Richard Jenkins) also playing pilgrim at the hermitage and he speaks in zen to get her to the point where she can get between the sheets with Javier in an Indonesian hut.  Huh?  The amalgamation of the material world with that of the spiritual and the sensual covers too much ground in too little time while the formulaic ending of girl riding the waves with her new man trivializes the more somber issues introduced but never fully developed or rectified in the first two segments of the trek.

As ""Eat, Pray, Love"" can't figure out just exactly what its point is, the actors can't figure out how to play it. Choreographed with MTV-ish segments of Julia as Liz in different parts of the world, the audience strives to participate but cannot--Liz's pain is explained, but it is too nebulous--too deep and indulgent to fully understand.  All Julia Roberts can do is alternatively look sad or happy.

Bottom line?  Watching Julia Roberts travel to three different world venues as she ponders the big question of life's meaning doesn't quite work in this film adaptation of Liz Gilbert's bestselling book ""Eat, Pray, Love.""  A better venue for this soul trek would have been a National Geographic series where the points of scenery and dogma could have been better exemplified in documentary format.

4065345,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"""Eat Pray Love"" is a botch. There are some very pretty images onscreen of beautiful people lounging and engaging in shallow, narcissistic, pseudo-spiritual preening and posing, some nice, crunchy, flowing, draping, tie-dyed, robes and scarves, and some heaping plates of pasta gorged down by people with perfect teeth. It's like looking at a spiritually pretentious, multi-culti American Express commercial for two and a half hours. The travelogue scenes are undermined, though, by inappropriate camera work. Director Ryan Murphy uses a shaky, handheld camera, spinning scenes, and extreme close-ups. His cinema-verite style is very out of place with this material.

Other than Richard Jenkins' performance, ""Eat Pray Love"" has not one second of integrity. It wants to be about the nature of love, the mystery of life, and the search for the transcendent. The main stars and Ryan Murphy, the writer-director, show no evidence of any depth or insight on any of these questions. I pity the fool who takes this film on as a spiritual guide or love guru.

I'm not sure if viewers were supposed to have as much contempt for the characters as I ended up having. Was I supposed to regard Elizabeth (Julia Roberts) as a passive, parasitic, narcissist, coward, and tramp who slept with anyone who was almost as good looking as she? She's coupled with three men in the movie, and flirts seriously with two more, and they are all pretty enough for a travel layout in Vanity Fair. None has any discernable personality. The only reason Elizabeth has for hooking up with these guys is that he and she are the two best looking characters onscreen at any given moment.

Even though Elizabeth embarks on a life-changing world tour, and does one charitable deed, she comes across as passive. Others in the film have lives; Elizabeth stands on the sideline, watching. She lives through others. This is especially evident when her Indian friend, Tulsi, is forced into an arranged marriage at age 17.

I've met Hindu women in their forties and fifties who could still cry real tears over that moment when they came home and found the red sari and were forced to start producing children for a strange man they didn't know and didn't much like. This film treats forced, child marriage as just another chance for stunning wardrobe changes and shots suitable for a National Geographic spread.

The multi-culti ""It's a Small World"" approach is morally grotesque, especially in a film that wants to be about searching for the big truths. In terms of the structure of the film itself, showing Julia Roberts, no doubt the tallest person there, hanging out at an Indian wedding just makes the character into a dilettante, someone the viewer finds hard to like.

In addition to being shallow, the script is at times incoherent. I had no idea what was going on in the first twenty minutes of the film. I didn't know - and I still don't - what Elizabeth does for a living, how she lost all her money, as the film tells us she does, or how she got the money back. She appears to give all her money to her layabout (but pretty) husband; why? Couldn't she get a better divorce lawyer?

Then she's off to Italy to eat pasta and tease a sexually frustrated language tutor and annoy traditional Italian matrons who don't understand her lifestyle choice; where'd this woman who just lost everything get the cash to do that? Viola Davis is compelling, but I have no idea who her character was or what she was doing in the film, except as a racial token, which is sad. I kept thinking how much better of a film this would have been had someone with Davis' depth been a main character.

James Franco pops up as one of Elizabeth's lovers, but his entire, tedious and uninteresting segment could have been deleted, and nothing would have been lost.

Elizabeth has a Balinese guru named Ketut. No idea whether we are supposed to take Ketut seriously or not. He is a fortune teller who repeats the same tired spiel to each new client: ""You are a world traveler."" Mind, he's reading the palms of world travelers. He smiles without letup, which gets creepy.

Had I not seen this film, I never would have known how bad an actor Javier Bardem can be when he has contempt for his project. As one of Elizabeth's boytoys, Bardem gives one of the single worst screen performances I've ever seen. He slums through the film with a phony, creepy smile on his face, the kind of smile that hides something. I was hoping that he might be a slasher; now that would have perked the film up.

There are a couple of utterly phony scenes, one with an Aussie lad we could never believe is Bardem's son, one where Bardem invites Roberts to an island getaway, that are overcooked to scorching point - you can practically smell the phony emoting - and that cheapen the film beyond redemption. What was going on with the director? Did he not see what Bardem was doing?

Richard Jenkins, as a soul-wrecked Texan seeking enlightenment, or at least the ability to sleep at night, is the one integral, worthy feature of the film. His character is real, and believable, so well-written I have to guess someone other than the main writer created him, and perfectly well acted.

See a really brilliant film about a beautiful woman on an international quest for spiritual transcendence: Fred Zinnemann's 1959 ""The Nun's Story"" starring Audrey Hepburn and Peter Finch.",1282867200,23,5389,4.750802139037433
4065346,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"What did I think? Well, ""Eat Pray Love"" is way too long. At two hours and 20 minutes, a film has to be more than the sum of its parts to be memorable. ""Eat Pray Love"" is not. We're never really convinced why Roberts as Liz Gilbert needs to indulge in a year off to travel the globe, and to go to the three specific places she visits. We know she wants to go back to Bali to meet again with an elderly spiritual adviser she meets there at the start of the film. We know she decides to go to an ashram in India to follow the teachings of a spiritual leader her vacuous post-divorce lover (James Franco; wasting his considerable skills)followed. Unfortunately, Franco was totaling uninteresting and not believeable as a man that Liz could really care for. Her character doesn't even seem to be particularly taken with the vocation of his particular ashram. We know she decides to go to Italy because, well, if given the chance, wouldn't we all go?  Thus begins the ""Eat"" part of her journey.

Along the way, the solo Roberts as Gilbert (from now on, I'll just say ""Liz"")meets many and makes friends in every venue. During the journey, the crystallized reason for my enjoyment makes itself known at several turns...all involve touching small moments of friendship shared between Liz and someone who has come to mean a lot to her. It goes without saying that I go to see tear-jerker movies (my latest was the schmaltzy and wonderful ""Letters to Juliet""), but they play and prey on their audience. Far more enjoyable are the movies which are subtle enough to create a lump in your throat, have your eyes well up, but allow you to flow through the moment on to the next scene. There are several times in the film that this happened to me, and those moments (and the cinematography and the incredible soundtrack) make me happy that I plunked down my $9.50.

One of them involves Liz, who celebrates Thanksgiving with her adopted friends in Italy. As the dinner nears, it is discovered that the friend in charge of the turkey had not even defrosted it. The group enjoys the rest of the dinner, enjoys immensely the time they spend together, and then all nap through the night while the turkey cooks... waking in time to have it for breakfast. The scene where the camera pans across all the guests in ""group nap"" are charming, the reveal of the reason they stayed, the turkey, is one of those small chuckles and moments where you really feel the characters, because you have known people in your life who would have done exactly that with you.

In India (""Pray""), Liz participates as a spectator at an arranged marriage between a young girl and her groom. During the ceremony, she pans back to her own wedding day, a wedding to Stephen (Billy Crudup) that ended in disaster when she abruptly determined that she could no longer pretend that she was happy with him, while pretending that their life together was enough for her. It wasn't. The poignancy of Liz' memories is when she imagines that they dance to the song that SHOULD have played at their wedding reception (the song that did play gives us another totally charming flashback, perhaps Crudup's only likeable moment in the movie). Into the mix comes the first 8 bars of ""Harvest Moon"", the ethereal love song that instantly makes you realize that Neil Young is a genius. I'm instantly transported by Young's imagery, and the lump comes back into my throat. I try hard to match my own memories of Harvest Moon with the dancing scene between Crudup and Roberts, but my own memories are more tangible and more connected to the song than the scene on film. However, the moment stands out as a reason for me to watch the film on DVD, and also wakes me up to how extraordinary and funky the soundtrack is; with two songs by Young, two by Eddie Vedder and some delicious Brazilian jazz, it is unforgettable.

Also in India, the movie's best character, Richard from Texas (Richard Jenkins) makes an appearance, and from the casual nickname he gives Liz (based on her habit of eating everything in sight), ""Groceries"" , to the poignant scene in which he discloses the family tragedy that brought him on his own quest to India, Jenkins adds a friendship for Liz that feels more real than any that come first or follow later. Every scene that Jenkins is in is absorbing; you are left somewhat flat when he leaves and Liz is still in India, and you find yourself asking...why? Jenkins, a revelation in his role in the popular cable series, Six Feet Under, and a revelation as Theron's father in the bleak ""North Country"", has been wasting away, waiting for Hollywood to rediscover him. Looks like that wait is over.

On to Bali, where the movie gets its biggest appeal; Javier Bardem as Felipe joins the film and finally Liz's quest doesn't seem so silly anymore. There is real chemistry between Roberts and Bardem, and the romance is so delicious that the lumps are back in my throat again. Also hard to beat are Bardem's moments on the phone and in person with the young actor who plays his son. His joy and sadness are so real. Liz's crusade to help a destitute mother in Bali by gathering donations from America also threatens to unravel me. Bali is so beautiful, Liz becomes so much more believable there, that the infinite 1.5 hours it took to get to this point don't matter so much anymore.

And as the film wraps, I realize that, despite the harsh criticism from others, I appreciated Roberts' craft, her ability to capture you with facial expression, some of the supporting players, the beauty of her stops in the world, and the quirky soundtrack, far more than I ever enjoyed the book. Screenwriters Jennifer Salt and Ryan Murphy (who directed; also from ""Glee"", ""Nip Tuck"" and ""Running With Scissors"") may have left the audience stranded and muddled for long stretches, but they did manage to eke out a film that, in a way, was worth a look.",1282780800,,5890,4.609151572926597
4065347,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"In ""Eat Pray Love"" you are going to see a lot of Julia Roberts as Liz exhibiting every possible facial expression for the doting camera that couldn't seem to get enough close-ups of her. This is a long movie which seems even longer than it is. We are going on a quest with Liz to Rome, to an ashram in India, and to Bali. I think she's looking for the meaning of her life, although I'm not quite sure because the movie seems to be sending out a lot of mixed messages.
Liz wakes up to find her marriage is a failure, and I never do quite figure out what's wrong with it. Do people mumble in movies these days, is the sound track turned down too low, or am I going deaf? Then she falls in love (maybe) with an aspiring actor, but that fizzles out so she goes searching the world for sustenance, revelation, and romance.
In Rome she meets a passel of friends, but mainly she seems to be pigging out on the delicious Italian food. I have never seen Italian food so attractively and lovingly photographed. Of the three locations, Rome is conveyed more thoroughly and evocatively than the other stops.
When she gets to the ashram in India, she finds that the lady guru is off in New York so she has to learn meditation from others. We really see only the ashram and don't see much of India. At the ashram she meets Richard, a man who really is in bad mental shape (played excellently by Richard Jenkins).
Did you ever get one of those fortune cookies at the end of a Chinese dinner which contains the blandest, most generic piece of advice you could find, advice that can fit anyone and doesn't offend anyone? That's the way I feel about this movie. Liz keeps meeting people including a medicine man in Bali who come up with handy aphorisms, truisms, palliatives, and nostrums which seem inane and goofy. She gets a lot of counsel and meets happy couples, but this chick has to keep looking, searching, discovering, looking...
Borrowing a line from the movie: unless you buy a lottery ticket, you can't win the lottery of life. Everywhere Liz seems to be having epiphanies and gaining insights. Some people in the theater walked out in India and never did get to Bali where she met Mr. Right. Don't ask me why he was the right guy. He badly needed a shave, was a sensitive guy, but so were the other two in her life. Is it a feel-good movie? Hard to say. She's a confused gal who left me in the dark, hoping the Bali section wouldn't be too draggy.",1282348800,7,2442,4.357456140350878
4065348,2,B0033AGJ5Y,"[Based upon Theatre viewing].

First rate cinematography and acting; sporadically first-rate script - some of the most very compelling, poetic lines I've ever heard in the movies, though there is an overuse of soliliquey...and anti-American Nuclear Family posturing.

Julia divorces her under-achieving, immature husband - a selfish guy who chooses to do a John Travolta imitation in lieu of dancing closely, to their originally chosen wedding song, with his bride, at the Reception.

She confers with her Psychologist friend, who says that having a child is like a tatoo - indelible, irreversible, as a life experience. Having a husband...another story.

Before she splits for Europe, she shacks with a local actor-to-be, who encourages her to also check out a Mystic in India. She eats in Italy, prays in India, and ""loves"" all over the place. A constant theme is that husbands are
not essential...for happiness.

The movie could have ended beautifully, and within two hours, in India, but she splits for Bali and meets another divorcee, a masculine man, who nonetheless calls his 19 year old son ""darling"" and kisses him on the lips - Julia sees great meaning in this.

Not to give away the full plot, let's say that the movie edition should have been, as I said above, under two hours, and the final half hour or so, could have been presented in a Special Edition DVD.",1282348800,2,1372,4.943478260869565
4065349,4,B0033AGJ5Y,"Title: Eat, Pray, Love
Director: Ryan Murphy
Writer: Ryan Murphy, Jennifer Salt
Cast: Julia Roberts, Javier Bardem, James Franco, Viola Davis, Richard Jenkins, Billy Crudup, Tuva Novotny
Year: 2010

A memoir is the exact opposite of a screenplay. A memoir is full of inner monologue, emotion, endless stories that take place over a great amount of time and it's all told in a first person narrative. A screenplay has to be short, concise, pure dialogue and contain very little obvious emotion (thats for the actors to interpret). So when a memoir is chosen to be adapted into a feature film it's quite the challenge. You have to stay true to the events and the person telling them but you also have to work within the constraints that a feature film demands. This is what writer/director Ryan Murphy (Running with Scissors, TV's ""Glee"") was faced with on his film Eat, Pray, Love.

Elizabeth Gilbert's classic memoir of self discovery, spirituality and love by traveling to Italy, India and Bali is a wonderful book full of wit, wisdom and meaning that can be appreciated by anyone; though only about 2/3s of that is translated to film. In any adaptation, whether it be novel, comic or memoir, there is one thing that I personally want to see faithfully portrayed: the themes (think Marry Harron's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho). Of course there are going to be adjustments to the narrative and characters due to the difference of artistic mediums, but thankfully Murphy pulls it off with his film. He is able to find the right balance of addition and subtraction to properly honor the source material yet also create a satisfying stand alone film.

The film beings with Liz (Julia Roberts, Erin Brockovich) struggling with her unfulfilled life and loveless marriage to Stephen (Billy Crudup, Watchmen). Divorce proceeds and so does a rocky rebound relationship with David (James Franco, Milk). Living an aimless life without passion and against the better judgment of her best friend Delia (Viola Davis, Doubt), Liz embarks on a round the world journey to reconnect with pleasure (eat), her spirituality (pray) and self esteem (love). Along the way she meets many 'the wise stranger' (Richard Jenkins, The Visitor; Javier Bardem, No Country for Old Men) and visits some of the most beautiful places on earth.

Sure, this may sound like a seriously sappy and contrived film, but in all honesty, it's not. Murphy never lets the film dip into melodrama and handles his story with a smooth, confident hand. While he could have taken some of the more edgier parts of the book (ex: Liz's severe depression) to the screen, the movie ends up being cleaner and crisper and all the more fun without it. The picture is meant to inspire the audience to have fun, to connect and to live life, if the darker issues were included the message could have missed the mark. Murphy accomplishes this sense of euphoria visually and ascetically with the help of master cinematographer Robert Richardson (Inglourious Basterds). The shots of Italy, India, Bali, and heck, even New York, are so georgous that if you can't afford to take a vacation this year, a ticket to Eat, Pray, Love will do the trick.

What ties the film together is, of course, the luminous Roberts. She is, of course, a bon a fide movie star and this material is something that she can easily use to showcase her talents. She is backed by a terrific and believable supporting cast of Hollywood stars and native Italians, Indians and Balinese actors- all equally great.

Eat, Pray, Love may not be a groundbreaking motion picture, but it's certainly a film that is enjoyable. It engages you emotionally and to me, that is the first and most important thing I look for in any film. It might not be the most faithful adaptation fans of the book were hoping for (and how could it have been?), but on it's own it's a picture with an easy charm and it's a harmless way to spend two and a half hours.

Rating: B",1282176000,4,3972,4.78978102189781
4065350,5,B0033AGJ5Y,"I was hesitant to see the film, knowing how Hollywood can take a good book and ruin it.  I was also dismayed at the choice of Julia Roberts as Liz Gilbert.  Having read the book, I had a hard time imagining Roberts portraying the very intelligent, honest, and sincerely soul-searching Gilbert.  I can think of a number of finer actresses who would have been more convincing and perhaps contributed to a better film.

However, it seems that the fault is not all with Roberts.  I think the director must have played a major role in diminishing the book.  Still, we have to thank him for bringing it to life.  It is, by the way, visually gorgeous.

One of the major faults of the script is the way it didn't adequately show the depths of Gilbert's despair in the beginning.  It  actually portrayed her husband as a pleasant-enough guy which is contrary to the message in the book. The film almost makes it seem that she's leaving him just because he doesn't want to go to Aruba with her.  No wonder so many people who haven't read the book slam this character as empty, spoiled, whiney and selfish.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is her acute despair that propells her to make her amazing journey.

About half way through the film, I overcame my dislike of Roberts.  It was, coincidently, in the India segment, about the time Gilbert began to face her own problems and discovered a new depth in herself.  Roberts rose to the occasion and showed the new maturity beautifully.  The scene where she offers her ""gift"" to the newlywed Indian girl is quite moving.

Richard Jenkins is fun as the Texan she meets at the Ashram, although I did find his ""confession"" scene a little over-the-top.
James Franco as the actor didn't really impress me either...maybe because he mumbled most of his lines, preferring a lot of loopy facial expressions to portray his ardor.

The actors in Bali were good, especially the fellow who played the wise man.  He is almost worth the price of admission.  I agree with another reviewer that the interaction between Gilbert and Wayan, the medicine woman, was given short shrift.  But the importance of the Bali sequence was that this was where she found ""love.""  Bardem plays the charming Brazlian entrepreneur who overcomes her fear of love beautifully.  He's a little shaggy but that doesn't detract from his immense charm. He's perfect for the part--seems truly to be a man who is worth her attention, as opposed to the two she left behind.

I thought the Amazon review was excellent except for the conclusion that the story was more escape than spiritual.  To me, this came across as a remarkable tale of a genuine spiritual voyage.  The fact that it has a happy ending shows that she did the hard work, faced her own inner demons and came out a better, happier person, more willing to love and to be loved. Doing this intense inner work is not self-indulgent or escapist; it's very hard and I commend Gilbert and anyone who endeavors to undertake it. It is hardly escapist.  I can only guess that people who haven't done this kind of inner jouney have no inkling of what they're missing.  Too bad...I hope this film helps some of them to wake up!

Despite the flaws of the film, I give it five stars for it's theme.",1282003200,9,3245,4.614310645724259
4065351,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Based on the bestselling ""memoir"" (air quotes because of the $200,000 advance her publisher gave her to essentially travel for a year and then write a book about it; I question the authenticity then of much of what she pens - characters, vignettes, anecdotes, and all) of the same name, by Elizabeth Gilbert, the movie is far more palatable, to my taste, if only because of the pretty pictures of the moving places where the book was set and the movie filmed - Rome, somewhere in India, and Bali.

If you hated the book, as I did (full disclosure: I ate up Eat in Rome, but the slog through the ashram in India was too much - I found myself Praying for it to end or get better, neither of which came to pass, so I simply gave up and said to hell with this piece o' Oprah-touted crapola), I think the movie is still worth your while for the well-shot scenery.

4065352,3,B0033AGJ5Y,"Like anyone who has the slightest interest in seeing this 2010 film, I was seduced by the Travel Channel images in the trailer and the sight of a radiant Julia Roberts in her first full-fledged star vehicle since 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mona-Lisa-Smile/dp/B0001ADAVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mona Lisa Smile</a>.

The challenge faced by director/writer Ryan Murphy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glee/dp/B0032JTV6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glee</a>) and his co-screenwriter, former actress Jennifer Salt, is how to make something dramatic out of what is essentially an inward quest toward self-fulfillment without turning the whole venture into a mire of clichs that passes for dramatic structure. They don't actually succeed, but somehow Roberts' goodwill and infectious manner, missing for most of the decade, overcome much of this obstacle in her sympathetic portrayal of Gilbert.

After a brief preface in Bali where Gilbert interviews a prophetic medicine man who forecasts her love life, the plot begins in earnest with Gilbert's emotional meltdown back in New York six months later. Liz (as the character is called in the movie) divorces her flaky husband Stephen who has upended their marriage with plans to go back to school. She rebounds in a passionate affair with David, a younger actor, but recognizes how she again submerges her own identity in the relationship. In order to halt this recurring pattern and find enlightenment toward her true self, Liz decides to take a trip around the world with three destinations in mind - Italy where she eats, India where she prays, and Bali where she falls in love. Her first stop is Rome, where a young Italian tutor teaches her the art of doing nothing. With the help of her new Swedish best friend, this means accepting the ten extra pounds on her frame due to a steady diet of pasta and pizza. Liz then moves on to an Indian ashram where she receives essential spiritual guidance from a tough-talking Texan named Richard.

She finally comes back to Bali to reunite with the medicine man and then accidentally meets Felipe, a recently divorced Brazilian who may or may not turn out to be her soul mate. Because Murphy and Salt appear intent on remaining faithful to the book, they attempt to cover too much for a feature-length film. Secondary characters become trivialized, and situations become rushed and pat. Take, for example, Liz's relationship with a healer named Wayan in Bali. So moved is Liz by Wayan's plight, she emails all her previous travel acquaintances to send money in order to buy Wayan and her young daughter a house. Yet, we get very little sense of any meaningful friendship between the characters. That's because the movie fails to capture the deep emptiness of Liz's soul that would drive her to make this life-altering journey. This is what the author did better in the source book, i.e., show the underbelly of Liz's despair through insightful comments and some pithy prose. As the movie stands, it's left to Roberts to flesh out the character's emotions without sounding like a whining, privileged woman of means. It's no small feat.

When not providing the sometimes smug narration, Roberts is luminous but not the film's only standout. Even though his character has to provide the hoariest bromides, Richard Jenkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Visitor/dp/B0015OKWKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Visitor</a>) manages to bring fiery heart and gravitas to the Texan who forces Liz to take a hard look at herself. As Felipe, Javier Bardem (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vicky-Cristina-Barcelona/dp/B001DJ7PR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>) has to play the feminist ideal of the modern man and consequently comes across almost too evolved to be honestly compelling. Less impactful turns are provided by Billy Crudup as Stephen (though his scene at Liz's divorce lawyer's office provides a much-needed edge to the story), James Franco rather morose as David, and Viola Davis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doubt/dp/B001PA0FFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doubt</a>) as wisecracking best friend and editor Delia (similar to the role she played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nights-in-Rodanthe/dp/B0017ANB08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nights in Rodanthe</a>). Robert Richardson provides the rich cinematography that captures the ripeness of each exotic location down to the luscious pasta dishes in Rome.

At it's core this is a story about having a broken heart and breaking someone's heart. I could relate. Who can't?
