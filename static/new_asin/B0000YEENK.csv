8004420,5,B0000YEENK,This film by the director of Battle Royale deals with a group that decides to make it big by becoming Blackmailers. It has a great noir feel to it but be prepared for a downer ending,1412726400,,182,4.083333333333333
8004421,4,B0000YEENK,"While, yes, the video has no subtitles (should be able to understand most of it at the 2-kyu level and a general understanding of Yakuza-style talk), it is a great film from the 1960's. Also, the streaming version found on Amazon is sort of fuzzy, but the DVD version is not. So, don't hold that against the film. :)",1256342400,3,316,4.372881355932203
8004422,1,B0000YEENK,"There are no subtitles in this film--written and spoken language is Japanese!!!  I speak and read English and French.

The film has the appearance of a badly colorized, old-old-old, badly edited, deteriorating, fuzzy, black-and-white film.

This was an unappealing lost of $3.99 and a jolting deflation of my expectations.",1204416000,,322,5.530612244897959
8004423,3,B0000YEENK,"I have seen two of Fukasaku's major works (the first being Battle Royale and Battles without Honor and Humanity the second) prior to this movie. And if I had watch this before one (or both) of these, I would probably gave it a higher score. But, it is a bit light compared to those two. That is not to say there isn't anything to scoff at.

It has interesting camera work, biting black humor (with a dash of social commentary), and a passion for youth. It is a wonderful film for someone wanting a bit more in Yakuza films",1165795200,,522,4.2727272727272725
