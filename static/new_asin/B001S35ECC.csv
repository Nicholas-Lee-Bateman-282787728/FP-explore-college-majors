8339403,3,B001S35ECC,"The footage was okay, but my boys lost interest after about 10 minutes. and we barely watch television. So not real informative and not real entertaining. I think You Tube has better videos. I wouldn't buy it again and I wouldn't recommend it to others",1377475200,,252,4.622222222222222

8339405,4,B001S35ECC,"I grew up an Air Force kid, and Dad worked most of that time on C-130s. In an effort to help his grandkids understand what he used to do, we've talked about C-130s. He's told them a little about the planes and his work, but kids like to see things, right?

And since we couldn't quite scrape up $160 million to buy a C-130 to show them, we bought this DVD.

It is not a highly slick and glamorous production. It shows what the airlift aircraft of the US Air Force can do. The basic capabilities are narrated, but most of the time is video of flying airplanes, landing airplanes, cargo loaded, cargo unloaded. Which was just fine for us. Since all 3 kids are highly interested in the plane, there weren't really any attention span issues.

The DVD is kid-friendly. Even in discussing the AC-130 Gunship configuration, there is no ""live combat"" or any intensity. The closing segment about transporting wounded is perfectly tame as well.

The one thing missing, at least to our eyes, was a C-130 doing a ""Touch-and-go"" maneuver, which they got to see in real life and found very exciting. So, they were hoping it would be on the film. It's not---but that's no real loss when you've seen it actually happen.

Worth the low cost (under ten bucks) to buy and let the kids watch. It couldn't hurt for them to have loadmasters and Herk Navs for heroes instead of over-steroided athletes.",1313798400,2,1379,4.544354838709677
