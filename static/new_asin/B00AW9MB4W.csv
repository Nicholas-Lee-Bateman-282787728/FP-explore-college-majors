5511189,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I was not happy with the ending of the book to start with. I was hoping the movie could do better but went from bad to worse. I liked the way the book started with Ender as a six year old, the movie jumped to fast with a stupid end. The acting was very good I must say. I say rent it and if you like buy. I will watch again.",1381276800,,324,3.5774647887323945
5511190,5,B00AW9MB4W,"1.  This is a review based on a realization the movie is finally coming.
2.  I have listened to the audiobooks repeatedly, and thouroghly enjoy them....
3.  This movie-if following what was discussed in the commentary has been long in coming, like twenty years plus.  Due to producers not wanting to follow the book with young kids as the primary charecters, and wanting to change the story by adding a love interest.
4.  According to the commentary at the end of the audiobooks it should be a combination of Enders Game and Shadow of the Giant.

I plan to get to the theater and buy the disk, and hope that Orson Scott Card (the books creator) was successful in keeping to the essence of the story, as it is far to long to be all in there....

Read the books / or listen to them as I do...",1371427200,7,790,4.297297297297297

5511235,3,B00AW9MB4W,"So, if you like the book ignore the book and look at this movie like it is the book squished into a really short movie.  Basically things get squished so hard that a bunch of the story has to be cut out.  Things get mashed into the wrong place (Bean), and some characters actually end up being smaller (Bonzo).  This movie removes all the internal struggles and... well the main attraction of the book and makes a sci-fi movie that is like a readers digest version.  Forget the Giants Game (it is in the movie), because it is not reeally important.  Oh yeah and if you were expecting Locke.. and his sister in here... nope not at all.  They mash all the null gravity games basically into one game.  The forward base and the colony are mashed together.
I have to give them credit, though (hence the 3 stars)... they hit on most of the major points.  The ending is really cheesy and lame (from the book reader POV), but I understand why they had to mash it up like that.
This is like reading cliff notes that fell into the toilet... a lot of the main stuff is missing and it will make you upset, but you get the basic idea.
If you never read the book this movie is probably pretty good, because lets face it Ender's Game is a good (gritty) read.
Ender doesn't struggle.  There are no politics.  The older people basically are just winging it (not really manipulating everything to get a result).
Just ignore the book and watch the movie for what it is.",1528588800,,1450,4.337037037037037

Was a movie about a kid named Ender that didn't act like Ender, didn't face the same challenges as Ender, or have the growth or development that Ender had in Card's novel. I guess they did it for time, but that just made the whole movie feel rushed and empty.",1525564800,,280,4.30188679245283
5511272,3,B00AW9MB4W,"This was a difficult movie to review. I normally approach movies based on books with a mindset that they will never be as good as the books. Instead, I try to see them as a movie about that book, in it's spirit. This usually works, and I can often enjoy movies that get bad reviews because the don't match the book ""well enough"".

That being said, if you haven't read the book, watch the movie first. You'll enjoy it. I gave it 4 stars from that perspective. The characters weren't as fleshed out as I'd like them, and the movie could have easily been 20-30 minutes longer and It would have gotten a higher rating. more time to flesh out the characters, the battle games...I left feeling at the end like Ender wasn't a commander, he was just a kid playing games, which is about as far away from the book's intentions as you can get. But as a standalone, it's a good movie.

Now, From the perspective of the book, I give it 2 stars. I had a hard time feeling like any of the larger undercurrents and themes from the book were carried well at all. characters were moved around, multiple characters meshed together, so many things changed...They could have done things differently and still carried the theme well, and this didn't play out in the movie at all. The spirit of the book wasn't there In my opinion. Like I said earlier, I give books-to-movies special consideration, and even with that I struggled to finish this movie. I didn't feel compelled to watch it out, and had almost no connection with the characters, unlike the book. The graphics were great though, and I enjoyed how they expressed the Buggers.

So it ended up with 3 stars as an average. I won't downplay the movie, but if you haven't read the book, watch the movie first. You'll enjoy it allot more.",1525305600,,1771,4.476780185758514

After I entered the code to redeem the digital copy, I found out that it had to be streamed though VUDU, Fandango, or ITunes. The only one that I could figure out how to access was VUDU. After setting up an account, the movie refused to play. None of the help articles was very helpful (one, for example, just took me to a list of about 200 flash player error codes) and it was only after a google search that I realized it wasn't supported on my chromebook. But, by this point, the code was already 'used' and couldn't be applied to any other digital service (even if I could have figured out how to make them work.)

5511301,3,B00AW9MB4W,"The movie suffers mainly because they did it in one movie. Ideally, they should have split the one book into 2 movies to include the more meaningful and important aspects of the book. The age differences from the 2 were also a little startling at first (I read the book before I saw the movie). Asa Butterfield is a fine actor and gave a great performance with the script he was given so it was not his fault at all. They could have had him in the 2nd movie for the older parts and had another set of younger actors to match the book's timeline for the first movie. I feel badly for the actors for having been thrust into this movie tbh as it wasn't a fair shake for them as it wasn't a blockbuster due to the flaws I stated, hence the movie's dismal $ gross in theatres. The special effects are top notch btw. I hope that another director and film company decide to remake the movie correctly as I have pointed out either in theatres (3D would be ideal ofc) or as a special series on Netflix or similar platform (but not a G rating in the hands of Disney as that would compromise much of the character study of the story).

I rarely want to ask for my money back for a movie rental, but I would make an exception for this. The parts that were cut out were unnecessary and the direction was confusing and contradictory.

5511409,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Enders Game Movie Review
  Imagine eating pizza without the cheese; that is what the movie Ender's Game is like.  The movies special effects fascinated me, but the script lacked many important scenes from the book. This is just one reason why people say a book is better than a movie.
  In the movie we see Ender and all of his companions continue to take on challenges throughout their journey at battle school. Important scenes like the battle scenes are included, but the movie skips scenes like at the end of the book.  Ender goes to a planet that was once colonized by the buggers, and finds a baby bugger. He then starts writing about what the bugger were like when they were alive. He goes on all these adventures after the final battle but in the movie it just ends after he finds the baby bugger. It was very anti-climatic and uninteresting at the end. In the movie they make ender seem all nice and that when he hurts someone it wasn't his fault. In the book it shows that ender is a killer when he needs to be and I think that it makes the plot very interesting.
Again, the movie is interesting and entertaining. However, if you like the book then stay away from the movie.",1519948800,,1184,4.408256880733945
5511410,2,B00AW9MB4W,"The Enders Game movie was based on the book Enders Game, written by Orson Scott Card. In my opinion, the movie consisted of many flaws. First of all, the movie only focused on one main point of the story plot and took away everything else. For example, many battle scenes that were important in defining some of the characters were not even shown in the movie. Because of this, you did not get to know the characters as well then you would if you read the book. Also, the Enders Game movie felt extremely rushed. Many things were taken out of the movie that was in the book, and the movie did not seem to flow like it should have. The acting is the most horrific acting I have ever seen. Especially the main character - you would think you would cast the main character as the best actor, but he was probably the worst. The horrible acting made the movie somewhat funny to watch. In addition, the director completely cut out the last scene of the book. The ending in the movie did not match up with the ending in the book which made me mad.
 The only thing I viewed as a pro for the movie, was the fact that the graphics of the movie were very talented. When Ender was in the battle with the buggers, the graphics showing the fight scenes were drawn out very well. The directors did a good job making the battle school and the fights look almost futuristic.
 In Conclusion, If you like science fiction type movies, then you would enjoy watching Enders Game. Although, in order to enjoy the movie, I would read the book first. If you do not read the book first, the movie can be somewhat confusing sometimes because you do not know the background information that was written in the book but not shown in the movie. This movie would be a movie you would only want to watch one time because you would not be able to sit through it a second time.",1519862400,,1843,4.30835734870317

5511413,5,B00AW9MB4W,"I won't go into the differences between the book and the movie, as that ground has already been covered.  I also believe the deviations were probably necessary in order to make the book translate better on screen.  What matters most to me is that the movie captured the essence of the story, i.e., leadership and the ethics of war.

Without giving any plot details away, I will just say this movie contains probably one of the most effecting and important commentaries on ethics of war I've ever seen in any story, and the last scenes are some of the best scenes I've ever seen in any movie.  Ender's views on how wars are fought are simple yet profound, not to mention ironic given Card's actual views on real wars that are being fought right now.

As for the mechanics of the film - the acting, the directing, the visuals - they were all done well.  I thought this was probably Harrison Ford's best performance in a long time.  I sensed he was really committed to his character.  Asa Butterfield as Ender was also very good.  He is resigned yet doubtful at times; caring yet ruthless; immature yet wise.

In summary, the movie stays true to the essence of the book while deviating from certain details; is well-acted and directed; contains some of the best scenes in any movie; and has arguably the greatest twist in the history of story telling.",1518912000,,1348,4.579166666666667

5511463,1,B00AW9MB4W,"This is a horrible horrible adaptation of the book. Orson Scott Card is a very intelligent person. He understands intelligence and beautifully wrote about intelligent children and the dilemmas of adapting to a world of average adults and peers. His book was about politics. The politics of childhood. The politics of governments. The politics of the structured environments intelligent children prod and push and break as they come of age. The process of overcoming challenges through strategy and logic. The trials of learning to balance that logic with empathy. The battle with nihilism that children like Ender inevitably face. Whoever wrote this script and directed this movie is a very unintelligent person awed by the cool space ants and anti gravity moon rays and super fast space ships and awesome fight games awe man zero gravity that's so cool! The movie is utterly offensive to the novel. This isn't a mishap in fanfare to iconic characters or events of the book (although there are plenty), this isn't a floundered adaptation of a concept of the novel, or a badly chosen plot scheme to drive some theme of the novel that ""works"" better for the screen... it's simply a complete misunderstanding of Card's work. I have to watch it in short 10 minute intervals. I will finish this movie the same way I would stair at a train wreck full of decapitated and burning corpses. I won't enjoy it but I'll be drawn to it for the simple fact that it's addicting to see how horrible and awful something can actually be. Ender is not in this movie. Neither are any of the other interesting and complex characters. It's just some bozo characters with the same names and a skeleton plot of the book.",1517270400,,1695,4.78839590443686
5511464,5,B00AW9MB4W,Read the book many years ago.  From what I remember movie appeared to follow the book pretty well.  Nice to the characters fleshed out.  Technical effects supported the story rather than dominating it.  Good movie.,1517184000,,214,5.0285714285714285
5511465,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Ender's Game is one of my favourite books, and I've always wished for a movie to be made from it, while at the same time dreading the prospect, as I've always had trouble envisioning how this would work out. Before the latest viewing, I read the book just beforehand, so I easily noticed all the shortcuts taken, as well as the (rather extensive) omissions and changes to the story.
Leaving out Locke and Demosthenes was a fundamental omission, but somewhat understandable - they would have constituted a major storyline in an already crammed movie.
The relativistic effects, the location or the forward base, and the queen/Ender interaction constituted major changes, but although those changes led to unnecessary logical errors, they didn't affect the main storyline significantly enough to doom the movie.
In the end, I think the movie is good, but it probably makes little sense unless you have read the book first.
Also, I think the movie shows that the story could probably be brought to life in all its glory, albeit as a miniseries. Then they could have slowed the pace, and included all the elements from the book - if possible, using actual six-year-olds and allowing them to age during the course of production.
Production values of the movie, special effects and acting are all excellent. If you like Ender's Game, watch this, but set your expectations to a reasonable level. And remember, the enemy's gate is down!",1517097600,,1427,4.925311203319502

5511488,3,B00AW9MB4W,"If you have read the book, you'll be really disappointed in the movie... Before making the decision to watch the movie, I already knew the movie will never be able to portray the delicate and complicated mind of Ender and it is his thoughts that really drag us into the story and made us go through the ups and downs with him. However, the movie completely lacks that. Not only it did not portray the struggle of Ender well, it even made the adults completely too sympathetic. It was Ender's struggle and his internal dilemma which push him almost to the brink of breakdown. Everything that he had been through that almost torn him apart made him great and the movie really lacked that.

However, the graphics and designs were great, even better than I imagined in my head. For that I gave it three stars.",1516665600,,805,4.513698630136986

While I didn't know it was adapted from a book, it had that feel. It was like a puzzle with some of the pieces compressed or missing, as happens when this isn't pulled off very well.

If you're into special effects and gaming, this might be your ticket. Otherwise, it's a nonstarter.",1515542400,,547,4.46

5511520,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I've not read the book in years so have to look at the movie as a ""stand alone"".

I thought the special effects were fabulous and the battle scenes were very well done. All in all, I would say the younger actors did a great job considering how much of it was done with a green screen (or is it a blue screen now?).

The most negative thing I can say is that they characterizations were not well done - considering how ""special"" Ender was, there was not much we learnt about him and what we did was mainly through Harrison Ford's viewpoint.

I also feel Viola Davis was underused - fabulous actress but never really understood why she was in the movie.

The one thing it DID do was succeed in making me want to re-read the book. If it is anything like what I remember, it will be better than the movie.",1511395200,,801,4.181818181818182

How the heck did they no find the egg or queen which happened to reside just outside of they're base. In the book text was set aside to allow you to see into Graffs mindset. This gave you in idea of how important  enders life was but at the same time how his life didn't matter as long as he performed his duty.

5511523,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I read Orson Scott Cards original novel and a couple of its sequels in the 1990s. The book was published in 1985. The plot is common to Many sci-fi films. A young hero leads the fight against a seemingly invincible empire. Like Luke Skywater, Paul Atreides and Neo in the Matrix, the hero is believed to be a chosen one with special gifts. He will save civilization, or at the very least defeat the bad guys. Ender's superiors believe that he is a military genius. He is the Messiah figure they have been waiting for. However, there are some who are skeptical about his talents. Even so, Ender becomes a general and leads the fight against a mysterious alien race.

Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed with the film, even though it is faithful to the book. The movie is well made and has an excellent cast. It is difficult to work out why it is not as compelling as the book. However, this is often a problem when a popular novel is turned into a movie. It looks and feels slightly different to how you imagined it on the page. I did enjoy the film, but not as much as I wanted to.

After digging into the book, I started to find myself actually liking the book and wanting to keep reading. If you watched the movie on this, I would highly recommend to read the book. The book is a lot more detailed and will go through scenes slower. The movie did help put scenes into my head though. I also liked how it talked about real life issues in a creative way. Ender had to constantly prove himself and outsmart the older kids. That happens a lot through out life. You will always have to prove yourself to other people who do not believe in you. One of the biggest parts about the book I could not believe was that Ender was only 6 years old when getting recruited to the army. He showed a very high intelligence and that caught Graff's attention. Lastly, I thought the end of the book was very well played. Ender knew what he did, and he had enough guts to help change what he did and help what he essentially destroyed.",1509408000,,1073,4.239024390243903

If you read the book and enjoyed the depth of the story told there, this movie has very little to offer. First, the actors are teens not kids, and thoroughly unconvincing as the worlds' most intelligent. That part alone could ruin the reality for some. Second, the book did a great job layering in the psychological warfare the teachers waged with the students - every factor was calculated - and it was not blind respect for authority that kept students in line. In the movie... any scenes remotely trying to show this was laughable. Sure, this is a difficult story to tell in a movie, but this attempt falls short of reasonable.

This is one of those films where you almost find yourself drowning in CGI. There's just so much of it and it just starts to feel like a giant fake video game after awhile.

5511888,4,B00AW9MB4W,"It's difficult to adapt a novel as emotionally, socially, and politically complicated as Ender's Game.  To give them credit, the producers (including  author of the novel Orson Scott Card), writers, and director gave it a really good shot.  They have had to truncate years of Ender's life into a year or two.  But they try to stick to the plot, as much as they've had to condense it, and on occasion, they've actually lifted dialogue from the novel (which started its own life as a short story, the first that Card published).  Toward the end the graphics borrow a bit too much from ""Minority Report"" and ""The Matrix.""  But this movie refuses to be run of the mill, and for that, I have to admire it.  It probably makes more sense if you are familiar with Card's work.  And if you are angry because of things Card has said against homosexuality, a. He's a Mormon, b. Rent Angels in America,  c.

It crams what should have happened over years into a thing that sounds like it only took months at most. They attempted to throw in a love story where there wasn't one. They screwed up Ender's character (in that he doesn't lose and will do anything he has to in order to survive and win), they threw in some BS warm and cuddly crap with the simulations at the end, and finally they make it seem like it wasn't a kill or be killed scenario between the buggers and humans. The movie hijacks the book and decides to make it a PC signpost.

5512136,5,B00AW9MB4W,"As an American Society, we have been very nervous about overdoing child exploitation.  Its a horrible and tragic thing that many people don't see as a threat.  Enders Game brings that perfect blend of awareness, adventure, and suspense into a beautifully written film.

Many films contain many vulgar and violent scenes that disturb the viewers and dampen the overall effect of the movie.  Gavin Hood the director understood that very well.  Enders Game contains many scenes that get the message across better and move vivaciously.  It portrays and deepens the character Ender in a way that isn't violent but gives him an aura of intelligence.

Enders game is all about the post-apocalyptic survival of mankind in the hope that peace can once again be achieved.  In order to maintain this hope, a collaboration of nations collect their smartest children to an orbiting commanding center to go in hopes of surviving another space attack by an alien race.  Often times kids as the main character are portrayed as helpless, cruel, torturous, and even bullies.  This is once again an  astonishing exception.  Enders Game maintains Enders clear idea of motives and determination.  Because of this change, Ender is now turned into a positive role model that can be represented as a young adolescent for his age.

Many would say that Enders game is unethical because it puts children as young as 8-12 into the military in high stress situations.  This peculiar choice was not meant to be contentious.  Its giving us a wake up call.  Kids as young as 17 are joining the military.  Kids, and I mean actual kids in the military for our country is becoming more of a reality.  Ender is the perfect example in which he shows us the positive/negative consequences of this choice by his own government.

Enders Game is a real eye opener.  Hood does an excellent job in following the book so its more relatable as well. So pull out the popcorn and blankets.  What are you waiting for?",1487980800,,1969,4.832335329341317

It's tough to see, or better said, not see, what you expect. (I had the same issue with the Martian).

I have read both the Ender's Game novel, as well as the Ender's shadow novel, and I expected much of the two to diverge for the movie, but far too much was left out, and a lot of changes were made that were unnecessary.

*spoilers*

The best part? The only reason this review gets even 2 stars? The battle room was fantastically done.  Too bad they cut out almost all the battles from the movie.  The ""battles"" that were included were too short, too pathetic, and really, really pointless.  I'd rather watch the CareBears battle the My Little Ponies.

Some of the weird things that left me dumbfounded....
Why do Petra and Ender spend so much time together holding hands? They weren't an item in the books.
Why make the mind game something only Ender gets into, and not something everyone in Battle School plays? It's Bean that avoids the game to the consternation of his teachers!
Why pretend Bonzo lived?
Why is the queen still alive? Why is she on the planet with Command School? Why were they on a planet instead of the asteroid Eros?
Why was Bean so undercut? He has basically no role to play.

The biggest one the one that makes me wonder why they bothered to make a movie at all, (except as a cash grab):

Why, oh why, did anyone care about Ender in the movie? He is pathetic, marginal, mouthy, and doesn't do ANYTHING until the end...ish.

I had reread many of the books in the Enders Game series, and had such high expectations, that, looking back now, I think no movie, unless it was 8 hours long could have sufficed. Watching this again, after not having reread the books for a couple of years, I can see that they really did try hard to fit this incredible story into 2 hours. And they failed in many places. But if your expectations are reasonable for a movie, and you remember just enough of the book to fill in the gaps in the movie, then this movie will be just as moving as reading the book. On a side note, the technology choices through the movie are really quite prescient, with lots of futuristic devices that look so natural, you can almost miss them-",1479772800,,787,4.360544217687075

5512856,1,B00AW9MB4W,"I understand that saying ""The book is better than the movie"" is an often repeated statement. However, I must say, without having finished this movie(I have but twenty minutes to go), this is one of the worst adaptations I've ever witnessed. Jurassic Park was great, in its own way. The book was amazing, and the movie was good. I preferred the book because of its gritty horrifying beauty, and the movie was good because it was fun for the kids (I read this book before seeing the movie when it came out, and both happened before I was twelve.) They were both wonderful in their own way. I say this only because I want you to understand that I know the difference between the two is so often astounding. Alien is (In my opinion) one of the best Sci-Fi trilogies ever made. Star Wars is also amazing (The real ones from the 70's and so on, not the crap later). The Formic tunnels in the Eros portion of the film are a direct rip-off of the alien tunnels from Aliens, and that is just a small thing. These are also so you know that I have not based my comments on one movie... The fact that the producers or whomever had to invite Bean into Ender's launch crew, have Ender know that he crippled (I know he killed him, too) Bonzo, and have him not have killed Stilson, have Graff tell him the things such as needing to be a commander, Mazer is straightforward with him and his crew, the battle room is one room in the entire school, not multiples rotating, they're all obviously well over the ages of the characters in the book, Ender is handed everything he needs to know, not given an opportunity to react or act on his own, and many other discrepancies that are so incredibly off topic and attempting to make ten books into one possibility of one sequel that I wish to vomit on and punch all people who read the books and then agreed to perform in this piece of junk (I have more crude aphorisms) so that Hollywood would not try this again. I realize I'm too late by many years and have already witnessed some of the trash recently put out in that particular area. I do not, however, say that they did the best they could with whatever they were working with, because the horrific hunk of a waste of my life (Including this review) is so insanely awful that I honestly am thinking about travelling to L.A. and burning a complete set of the Ender quintet on the hairy (or shaved) asses of the people who let this be developed (Not to mention the actors/actresses who starred in it after reading the script.) Don't watch if you have read the books and don't like the taste of bile in your throat. If I could give this zero stars, it would be too generous.",1476576000,9,2653,4.350806451612903

5513026,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Enders Game
 In 1977 writer Orson Scott Card penned a short story for Analog Science Fiction.  Nearly a decade later he re-wrote his story as a full length novel, for which the Sci-fi community awarded him both the Nebula for best novel of 1985 and the Hugo a year later.  For a Science Fiction writer nothing tops these two awards.
 We finally have the story of Ender Wiggin on the big screen.  We have without doubt an artistic success with Enders Game.  Director Gavin Hood (who directed Wolverine, another tale of a conflicted hero) has been able to put his glorious version of Cards vision up there for all of us to enjoy.  Do not confuse Enders Game with such space operas as Star Wars.  Fans of main vein Sci-fi will love this film.  Producer Orson Scott Card spent $110 million to make this fabulous film.  We will see if a strong fan base and a wonderful rendition of the story with excellent special effects can bring in enough ticket money to justify the expense.  I hope so.  This four saw blade film deserves our support.  It did come in at number one for the weekend with $37 million in sales so we can have hope.
 Asa Butterfield (Hugo) as Ender provides us with a cerebral acting style.  We see the near genius Ender thinking through his various options to his challenges.  His forceful personality allows him to carry through his decisions with utter ferocity.  Fast decision making and relentless follow through are the only characteristics that will save Earth from the alien enemy.  For 50 years humanity has been breeding, training, filtering and discarding brilliant children, looking for the one mind that can defeat the aliens.  Harrison Ford is the heartless colonel that has the responsibility of training Ender and the other child warriors.  Ford has no bending to ordinary human emotions what so ever; the stakes are the extermination of all mankind or the extinction of the alien race.
 This doesnt sound very cheery.  This PG-13 (violence, xenocide) film hasn't much room for great acting, but Ford does very well.  The film does have room for gorgeous, large scale visual effects.  The scenes of the child warriors training in zero gravity are especially good.  The film remains faithful to the spirit of the original book, but we would need a multi-part miniseries to get in all of the characters and detail of the novel.
 Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley have supporting roles.  Also in supporting roles are two young female actors who have done good work in the past.  Abigail Breslin (the very young star of Little Miss Sunshine) and Hailee Steinfield (wonderful as an even younger girl in True Grit) have small but important roles.
 The universe terrifies and never forgives.  In surviving, we may lose our humanity.",1472428800,2,2748,4.772823779193206

Almost everything I treasure about the book is missing here.  I've tried watching it twice now, but it's just not an interesting story anymore and I don't care about the characters portrayed here.

5513132,5,B00AW9MB4W,"Leadership is not a simple behavior set, as the movie makes clear. Card had the US Marine Guidebook principles in mind. Ender's brother Peter was a genius sociopath, his sister Valentine was a genius empath. Ender was the balance between the two. As a fine way to spend time reading, I recommend the entire Ender's Game series of four genius children (Ender/Andrew, Valentine, Peter, Bean) in a world of adults who don't understand the intelligences they have ignited. A side trip into Arthur Clarke's Classic ""Childhood's End"" covers a similar theme. The whole kit and kaboodle is available on Amazon. The movie brings the story to the screen, with relationships among its characters intact. Given some of the ideas afloat in the movie industry, this could have ended up as a sci fi bug hunt. It's special effects are superb - I have a suspicion some of them inspired scenes in ""Star Trek Beyond."" For those who grumble about the shortened timeline, I refer you to Agatha Christie's comments on how changing stories from one medium to another requires merciless editing. Read the books, compare the presentation of ideas with the movie scenarios, enjoy Card's take on human behavior when faced with an external enemy.

5513400,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Ender's Game (the book) captivated millions of readers across the world. I am, most definitely, a huge fan. When the movie adaptation was announced I, like many, was both excited and nervous to see it because I didn't want it to take anything away from the book that I loved.
After watching it, I still feel the same way about the book as I did before. As far as adaptations go I think they did a pretty good job. Of course it doesn't follow the book perfectly-- there are parts that it skips, parts that it modifies and parts that are added in. I wouldn't go so far to say that I love it, but I am glad that I bought it and there are aspects/nuances of the book that I understand better after having watched it recreated on the big screen. I think the actors did a good job, but there's a lot to Ender that is tough to capture in such a short period of time.
In summary, I am glad that I bought it but can't say that I absolutely loved it. I would, however, recommend that fans of Ender's game give it a try (just once) and for those who know nothing about the book-- I still think it's a decent movie.",1466208000,,1103,4.111111111111111

I can presume that the book was probably better, but not having read the book I give the film five stars.  I can give a similar analogy with ""The talented Mr. Ripley.""  Having read the book first the movie did it no justice.  The book really showed you Ripley's state of mind, while the film tried to show this to you, but never made you understand.  The film left much to be desired.  Yet most of the people I have met that have seen the movie and not read the book ranted and raved about it.

Many said that the ending was easily guessed, but I did not find it so.  I did feel that the final battle scenes as well as the events after seemed rushed, and the film never really illucidates Ender's connection with the Formics.  I fail to see why he is so empathetic towards the enemy.  This seems to contradict when he crushed the bully ""to win all future battles.""  He was not sorry for putting him in the hospital.  Even being able to identify the problems with the plot and the sequence of events, I still rate this five stars.

There was a certain degree of hollowness to the feel of the show.  It's difficult to articulate but there certainly was a sense that something was missing.  Might have just been the way the show was edited.  That being said, it's one of the better sci fi movies I've seen in a while.  The emphasis was on exploring big ideas and painting a portrait of humanity's present with caricatures of its possible future --- in the way science fiction ought to be --- rather than on intense visual spectacle.

There was sufficient commitment to the story.  Some parts felt a little bit ham-fisted but that could be blamed on the source material they were drawing from.  The movie didn't seem to drag on as much as the novel did and it hit most of the book's key points.",1465171200,,831,4.493333333333333

5513571,3,B00AW9MB4W,"SPOILER WARNING, THIS REVIEW MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS

Ender's Game is a film based on Orson Scott Card's award-winning science fiction novel of the same title. Apparently, Card was involved in the movie adaptation. I never read the novel, and I admit that the film isn't one of my favorites. It is slow-paced and somewhat boring, with some characters looking like slapstick stereotypes (Bonzo comes to mind). The acting leaves something to be desired, too (again Bonzo comes to mind).

The premise is interesting, though.

The plot is set in the distant future after a brutal alien attack on Earth. It's implied at several points that the aliens are highly evolved social insects. Humanity pulls itself together and plans a counter-attack against the alien home world. Earth's space ships are remote controlled by specially trained children (sic). The battle bruised commanding officer Hyrum Graff, starred by an aged Harrison Ford, is looking for a kid with sociopathic tendencies and believes he has found the perfect candidate in Ender Wiggin. However, Ender turns out to be an empath with paranormal abilities and decides to play a game all his own, which could decide the fate of two civilizations

Avid watchers of syfy on TV or cinema will duly note similarities with Babylon 5, Starship Troopers and perhaps even Harry Potter!

Ender's Game contain a number of unexpected twists, but it isn't until the very end that we get to know the full picture of what's really going on. And by then, I was frankly bored, since most of the film deals with Ender's training at a space station, and a very superficial treatment of his relationships with the other cadets. I really only want to give this movie two stars, but since I happen to like the underlying idea (and plot twists) I will very graciously award it three.

When Ender's Game premiered in the United States, gay rights activists called for a boycott of the film, since Orson Scott Card has actively campaigned against same-sex marriage. Card is a Mormon and a direct descendant of Brigham Young. The boycott was rather silly, since the movie has an inclusive cast and an anti-racist message. And yes, social insects are, ahem, matriarchal",1463702400,,2197,4.940379403794038

5513663,1,B00AW9MB4W,I't never ceases to amaze me how movie watchers can be so less demanding than book readers. Anyone who has read this book can't help but find the movie lacking. It should have been a 3 hour movie minimun. It's cut down of storyline and character development robs it of any connectivity of events. The back story of Ender's siblings is not something that really could have been cut but was essential to the larger background of the story universe which is completely missing here. I'm surprised Card signed off on his masterwork to settle for this schlock.,1463616000,,555,4.673469387755102

First half was over long - spent too much time on Ender's development. Second have should have been developed more.

Note: I did not read the book, so the review may have been different if I had read the book.

On second viewing I've completely changed my opinion of this movie. I now rate it 5.0 stars. Maybe now being familiar with the material helped. Still wished they developed the relationship with the formic queen more.",1462406400,,614,4.63302752293578

I was so excited when the movie came out and so very dissapointed when I saw it.  To me, it probably would have been a good movie if I had not read the book first.  But the brutality that was in the book was not in this movie.  They did not portray Ender as he was meant to be portrayed per the book.  Orson Scott Card said it would be very difficult to find kids that could act in these roles.  The actors were great choices but the production held back the true story.....even changed it quite a bit.  Now, if someone wants to do this right they need to make it a mini series on HBO or even animate it properly.  The animation of this movie would do much better for the story than the movie did.

Missing more of Ender's back story than I would have liked, but still a damn good movie. 4.5 stars for the film. However.... I bought the DVD because I wanted the disc and also the Ultraviolet edition, which is included. Unfortunately, the included Ultraviolet edition is only SD (Standard Definition). I was very disappointed to discover this only once I plugged the code into Vudu. What is the point of Ultraviolet SD? Everything should be HD. With pipes being so large these days (most people with even the second-from-the-bottom (standard) cable internet service from Time Warner have massive bandwidth available to them), HD is no big deal. I see no reason to charge more for it. Seriously. So, if I wanted the HD edition, I could pay $6.99 MORE via Vudu. Feels like I paid for something and did not get what I thought I was getting.

5514280,3,B00AW9MB4W,"I knew going into this movie that it would be very different from the book, and I wouldn't expect it to be so in order to be a good movie. I simply expect it to stand on its own to be good. Obviously the book has a very extensive plot with complex themes, and the movie would only be able to develop a few of them. What they end up focusing on in the movie is Ender's struggle with hurting people and the tactical games he plays. I think this is a good choice, but unfortunately none of these points are developed well in the movie, only giving the plot points through a lot of simplified dialogue. I'd say they stuck to the book's plot points too much instead of developing the characters and the world by showing it on screen.

The cast itself is very well chosen. Veteran actors give veteran performances, and the child actors have been praised for their earlier work. Again though, the dialogue they have to work with is pretty dry so none of them stand out well. This movie was made for IMAX, and the visuals are really great. The set design is beautiful and practical for their environment. So I can only seem to blame the writer/director Gavin Hood for the expression of the story. I don't see how he got the green light for such a large, epic movie with a star-studded cast when he hasn't done anything like this before.

Anyway, I watched this movie to do a book report and it did help me narrow down the themes of the book, and visualize the battle spaces described in print. So it did that for me at least.",1453334400,2,1517,4.2822299651567945

5514328,5,B00AW9MB4W,"When I first heard of this movie ( about 2009) I had my doubts, how could such a great book (one which I didn't care for) become a great movie. My problem was the fact that they were using children, all apparently under the age of 18, to wage war. It amazes me to this day because I think the old fart politicians should go to the wars they want, and leave the rest of us alone. After seeing the movie, I think the kids should run the world, and the old farts go to war, even more so.

Something I didn't catch until a few days ago was the fact that Ben Kingsly and Asa Butterfield were both in this movie they were also stars in Martin Scorseses Hugo. Imagine that. I have to wonder what the connection was for the two of them.

Harrison Ford is also in this Movie and did a great job as far as I am concerned. I have to wonder if he was the real enemy just like Ender thought. There are a couple of childhood fights and some bullying. I do not think these fights should have ended up in someones death or disability, but the author was trying to prove a point, yes it does happen but not usually. Ender seems to have a lot of good thoughts and bad luck.

Bugs. In Starship Troopers we see how devastating bugs can be, gosh look in your backyard and you will see the devastation they provide us with in quick time. No need to go see a movie. Yet in this movie we have intergalactic space bugs, that can read your mind, and put thoughts into your head. Ok, that is enough, destroy them all!. However let it be known that with mans billions of years of experience with bugs, we have never won. Keep these things in mind while enjoying this movie.",1452384000,,1645,4.118380062305296

5514418,4,B00AW9MB4W,"This film is based upon an extraordinary novel of the same name. It has become a huge classic of the sci-fi genre and even turned into a magnificent audio book performance for those who prefer their reading that way. So this film had an enormous task ahead of it, somewhat like ""Harry Potter"", ""Gone With the Wind,"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Those films were also based on extraordinary novels. This film doesn't do as well as those two books did in their film incarnations. However, it did tell the same story and with all of the special effects that you could only imagine in the book.

What it didn't do though was put us in Ender Wiggins' head, which the book did. His is a very different head because his task is no less than to save his entire planet from aliens. A young person has to fight this war because it is all ""fought"" via video game maneuvers. You have to take a very young kid and train him from the start to have this video game mindset. Ender has it. He also is a natural born strategist and is always thinking in terms of moves.

Ender's brother and sister are given a bit shorter shrift in the film that the book. Since they have significant roles in the whole saga, I don't think the cuts should have been made there.

My guess is that you might enjoy this film more if you are NOT a huge fan of the book. I was such a fan so it fell short for me. If you've never read the book and know nothing about it, or its sequels, it may be a stellar experience for you.",1450224000,,1485,4.185314685314685

Many truths about how evil man can be, winning wars at any cost.

Killing out of fear,jealously, insecurity, like native Americans were, Jews,slavery,Jesus. How man never learns from their mistakes.
Ender questioned all of this, so he was lied to and manipulated to carry out the ultimate genocide.

I truly believe and history has shown,if man met other life in space,this as usual war and death would be ultimate outcome. Man fears anything they don't understand or can't control.

Ender, the maim character has natural abilities for being ruthless in fps simulations.  All of his peers hate him, but on cue, they all start following him as their squad leader.

5515102,4,B00AW9MB4W,"This was true to the story of the book, without the soul. I think finding the inner working of Ender's mind would have been great. The sets were great. However, some of the actors were wooden and boring. The actor that played Ender and Petra were terribly cast, they did an awful job. This whole movie depends on the actor playing Ender and if he had done a better job at showing PTSD, stress, and genius as well as the director doing a better job of getting that performance could have turned a movie I would like to a movie I loved.

End: Watch it once, you'll love it. Enjoy the beautiful CGI, the fun concept, the sets but after the credits roll you'll walk away and never think about it again.",1442880000,,698,4.287878787878788
5515103,2,B00AW9MB4W,"Read the book and was a fan. Movie destroyed the story and point of story by attempting to make it more palatable to perceived societal sensibilities.

In this case they should have bought another story and made it with these two stars instead of wasting their time ruining this great book.",1442793600,,328,4.771929824561403
5515104,5,B00AW9MB4W,"I wish I would have noticed that this was Blu-ray, which is incompatible with my DVD player.  So, I watched it on my Computer (nice big screen with good speakers).  It is nice to see a big budget movie with a Heart.  Spectacular visuals with an intense story line.  I am not going to give anything away.  Some scenes may seem a bit cut off or trite but it is  perhaps the Studio's fault for making them comply with 'policy' to keep it within a preferred time constraint.
I think this movie should be seen by everyone from age 14 and up.

I did not expect great things because I had not heard positive reviews from many people. However, those people are crazy, cos I loved it. I think it would have worked better as a trilogy, but I guess I will just have to read the books to prolong the journey.",1441929600,,394,4.337837837837838

5515186,1,B00AW9MB4W,"I first read the book as a teenager and have introduced several people to the story over the years.  That said, the movie deviates too far from the book, leaving out too much information.  I felt like half the story is told in the movie.

As a movie, it might be able to stand on its own if you haven't read the book.  For one who has read the book, I have to rate this movie at least as bad as Battlefield Earth.",1441756800,,413,3.9397590361445785
5515237,5,B00AW9MB4W,"Great movie.  Book is a hundred times better, but this wasn't too bad a representation of the book.

5515244,2,B00AW9MB4W,"The book means very much to me as a Soldier, an Officer, and a combat-arms Leader and I had very high hopes (and apparently too-high expectations) for it. My review is of the film, but the film happens to be based on a very important book and overall, they tried really hard and I appreciate their efforts, but they just missed the mark.

I would compare it to the fourth Harry Potter book- they got the basic story and hit the highlights, but missed just about everything else. It has it's good points- visuals and effects, good actors(overall) but mostly misses the book. It hit the high-points of the overall story, but completely missed backstory, the ending, the end-battle sequences and plan, the loss of human life, and the major emotional impact of the end of the war. Some of the actors were totally wrong for their characters- Bean and Bonzo specifically- while Alfre Woodard and Harrison Ford were good, but not great or perfect for their respective roles. Some major characters were fundamentally changed- Dap; and the military element seems contrived and feels slapped on as a last minute 'oh, wait, they're supposed to be Soldiers.' For all the work and effort put into this, it should have been much better and more faithful to the details of the story instead of just trying to hit the highlights. Like I said, this reminds me of the fourth Harry Potter movie.",1441238400,,1376,4.70954356846473

5515246,5,B00AW9MB4W,This movie exceeded my expectations.  I just rented it because my son begged for me to watch it since the book he read was so good and I watched it with him.

But the acting? They tried to act tough, but it wasn't till the end that the kids acted like a unit- Harrison ford doesn't have a tough bone in his body, for this part, especially the sergeant in the movie, but in my opinion time was not given for the actors to act better- for us to empathize for them, that was geared for the main character only and only kicked in at the last minute.

Literally, after reading the book and knowing the story, they left out so much. All of the arena battles that made his team respect and follow him. His strategies that he would come up with and implement made the schools officials realize that he was the one. This should of been 2 movies all day long. The first movie would of been all battle school and at the end he is on the ship heading for command school. The 2nd starts as he arrives at command school and the events that followed. Hollywood suits crunching the numbers and giving half the budget needed to make a great movie. Chris Gore of G4TV fame said it best. ""This movie is a great trailer for the book"".

5515471,5,B00AW9MB4W,"A friend had recommended the book to me a few years ago. She eagerly awaited my review and was disappointed with my lack of amazement. While I certainly enjoyed the twist that makes both the book and the movie a classic. I was put off by the writing style that definitely portrayed the decade in which it was written. I am not a fan of 70's style writings or movies. I was born afterwards, thankfully, and have no interest in reliving that time period. When I saw the movie, I finally understood the passion many felt from the book. It was intelligently updated for a modern audience and era. Science fiction has come a long way since its inception and it is all the better for it. I enjoy seeing this movie time and again.",1437004800,,723,4.362962962962963

This led me to the point of quiet anticipation to see this film.  Unfortunately, though there are many books and comics that transitioning to the big screen well, for me this wasn't one of them.  It wasn't that it was terribly bad because I didn't think it was.  Simply put, in-order to fit the whole book into a single movie, there was no time to develop the characters in a way that formulated a connection with the audience.  It hit many of the key points but it felt that story and everyone involved, was undeveloped.  My hope is that at some point a mini series or something along those lines can be created that will truly delve into Enders Game.",1436486400,,791,4.383561643835616
5515495,2,B00AW9MB4W,"Ender's Game is a Sci-Fi Near Future story that explores a question of what the human race would do under if an Alien race were to attack us.  Left in deportation for decades the human race prepares for their return to finish the job they started.  The original story is a Sci-Fi Classic!  And it's available on Audible!  Which is such a better version of this story.  Unfortunately the movie come short in telling this story.  It is true to the original book however tries to hard to spoon feed you why Ender is reacting the way he does and insults your intelligence being in the audience for not being able to understand the story.  Harrison Ford and the entire child cast are INCREDIBLE!  The movie editing and final cut are hinder the story and leave you asking ""What just happened""?  The studio should have taken the play version of this story and drop the audience in the middle of the storyline of Ender.  That way you don't need to be mulling over the sorta back story as to why Ender is the way he is and spend more time in Commander School which is where all the action and character building occurs.

In the movie, all of Enders personal struggles are rushed making his character feel really flat. In the book he struggles his way and discovers he's the best. Well his struggle is actually most of the book. In the movie he starts off as basically an ass kicker the entire underdog aspect is missed.

Maybe JJ Abrams or Joss Whedon should only make all sci-fi movies.

5515603,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I work with juveniles and awhile before this movie came out one of them told me about the book, and the surprise ending.  So I won't spoil that for anyone else who may have not seen this movie.  So how then to describe the movie?  Its a little like Starship Troopers meets Lord of the Flies, but more family friendly and with a serious streak of drama in its veins.  Asa Butterfield stars as Ender Wiggin, a seemingly non-threatening, slight young boy who is tactically unconventional, uncanny, proficient, and brutal.  When he is bullied he doesnt back down and acts to ensure that the bullies aren't likely (or capable) of continuing on in their abusive behaviors.  He is living in a time where the earth has almost been annihilated by an overwhelming alien race and he is picked out to attend a tactical boot camp.  Lets just say that he both has trouble with authority figures and he excels at the trainings, but will it be enough to save the day?

A caution to parents who are sensitive to violent content in their childrens entertainment.  Enders Game has a couple of scenes of quick but fairly brutal and shockingly serious violence.  It does stay within the boundaries of a PG-13 film and in no way depicts the violence for the value of entertainment nor does it attempt at any point to glorify it; it is a serious matter of the storys course.  Whether the human race is on the precipice of extinction or theres just a mean kid down the block, bullies engage in ugly behavior and sometimes provoke extreme and ugly behaviors out of others.  Also the adults in the movie treat the children not as children but as adults, and they push them hard (too hard perhaps) in the service of helping to save the humankind.  They are not necessarily nice people, but the story begs for a question to be asked: with such variety and variability within human potential what traits are important for human survival and society, and are these only important for the times in which we live?  For older ages or more mature youth Enders Game can be a powerful movie to bring out discussions that might not normally be generated by standard tween fare.",1435363200,,2140,4.582677165354331

 Even without reading the book, I felt the characters were flat and the story was rushed - as if they were trying to squeeze way too much stuff into too little time. The result was a movie that  just dragged in places and was slow yet things were happening behind-the-scenes that we had no clue about.

If faced with the same circumstances will we make a decision that will save us or damn us?  Its true the alien race that invaded slaughtered mercilessly but can you blame them when they themselves were facing extinction on their home planet.  Perhaps they weren't aware we an intelligent species open to reason.  A lot of, ""what ifs,"" in this film

5515882,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Harrison Ford in a sci-fi movie.  I was expecting action and bold story telling.  A young boy, the hope for the future.  Earth was attacked, but it was able to fight back and destroy the invaders.  Ever since Earth has been preparing for the next wave.  Children are being trained to fight. Ender is the perfect balance of strategy, violence and leadership.  Ender's Game shows Ender from cadet school to battle.  While the movie looks bold and is filled with fighting.  The story feels lacking.  I felt like I was watching a series of highlights.  I never felt connected with Ender's character.  As far as Harrison Ford's character I disliked him and wanted to stomp his face, which is kudos for Mr. Ford, as none of the other actors made me feel even a fraction of that, including Ben Kingsley.

Picture and sound quality were excellent.  However, the extras were minimal and not nearly as extensive as I would expect a sci-fi ""nerdy"" film to have, especially one based on a classic novel, with a built in audience.

I haven't read the book so I can't offer comparisons, but I felt as if I was missing so much of the story that I am planning to read it.

5515912,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Unfortunately, I had just reread Ender's Game before watching this movie, and it made deviations from the book painfully obvious.  Entertaining enough film, but here's the bad:

I hated that the kids were older in the movie, that they tried to make Petra a love interest (WTF, she marries Bean and why does every woman in a movie have to be a love interest and why does every male protagonist need a love interest???  This isn't When Harry Met Sally), that they removed the Valentine/Peter politics parallel plot, that they made the battles look like warm & fuzzy team building exercise, and that they made the kids Ender killed look like accidents.  The whole damn point is that Ender is kind, but when push comes to shove, Ender is a killer.  While he regrets killing, he never regrets or even questions the strategies he employed that took his attackers' lives.  If hindsight is 20/20, although it would still make him sad, Ender still would have killed Stilson & Bonzo if he had to do it all over again.  Also WHY DIDN'T ENDER EVER RETURN SALUTES?  When Dap (who didn't match the book at all) salutes him, I was cringing when Ender never returned the salute.  Who in the hell wrote/directed those scenes.  The rationale makes no sense and it was like nails on a chalkboard to watch.  And the kids weren't exhausted enough.  It still looked like video games/team building.  They didn't show how much pressure the kids were under.  We saw the adults under pressure, but not the child soldiers and the harrowing toll sacrificing their childhoods for earth took on them.

The good: I LOVED GRAFF & ANDERSON!  Well done.  I loved seeing the reports Graff was getting.  It really lent a sense of urgency and made his strategies toward Ender come from a more human place.  Casting Anderson as a Black woman?  HELL YES!  Why not?  I don't think Orson Scott Card ever wrote ethnicity or gender for Anderson, and it made movie Anderson more interesting.  Also, some of the technology he described in the books reads really dated nowadays, and I think they updated the technology in the movie in a way that integrated seamlessly with what the book was trying to portray.  The battle room scenes were too few (the whole book basically took place in the battle room), but they were well rendered.  It was fantastic seeing something I've read a million times be portrayed so well on screen.  And lastly, Mazer Rackham was a lot smarter and more well rounded than in the book.  I like that he had Maori tattoos and explained their significance in a way that was culturally respectful and wrapped up the concept of Speaker for the Dead in a nice way that wouldn't tempt Hollywood into a sequel.  :-P",1428192000,24,2687,4.647558386411889
5515913,1,B00AW9MB4W,"How do I describe Enders Game? Since Ive read the book myself and enjoyed it, you might say I have a very strong opinion of it. That being said, this is a TERRIBLE movie adaption!

The book was a number of things, but Orson Scott Cards classic was a book well ahead of its time in terms of theme and content. It was also a shocking book, and an intelligent book that military commanders in real life are encouraged to read. The story deals heavily with the themes of leadership, responsibility, consequences and the tortures of war.

In the distant future, the military fears the return of an alien race who almost destroyed the human race once before. Given their desperation, they have decided to recruit genius young children instead of adults because they believe kids can make better commanders. The shocking truth is, there might be some valid point behind this decision as the story goes on to explain. Ender Wiggin is the most promising of all those young cadets and his adult mentality climbs him up the ranks until the games he trains for drive him to near insanity.

Every awesomely amazing detail Ive described about the book is horribly downplayed in the movie adaption. The ironic thing is, this is a book that came out in the 80s. The comparisons between video games and war are more important now than they were when the book was written. It goes without saying, Orson Scott Card definitely afforded himself some risk taking when he shocked readers with this book, but the movie doesnt create that same connection with the viewers. Anyone under the impression this is a good movie... just doesnt know any better.

Enders Game is a movie that cant help but be compared to the book because its a movie that takes away from the plot rather than adapting it. The editing and the pacing are very choppy, as it skims over long periods of time without being clear how the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the characters are slowing changing them. There are some exceptions, of course, but some of the best moments such as the zero-gravity chamber are watered down because the movie can never explain the way Enders mind works or the reason why he is the subject of everyones interest. One example of this bad story telling is Alai, who is Enders strict and overbearing commanding officer. Ender is getting punished in one scene for saying he will outrank Alai one day, and is them getting a salute from him in the next scene without even showing us how any of this was developed.

I will admit it, the acting is phenomenal, as are the special effects. However, no amount of either is enough to save this watered down story that hardly explains any of the relevant plot or scientific details that are crucial to the story. The emotional struggle is toned down too, quite unfairly. There is a connection readers feel with Ender Wiggin when he descends to near insanity, before the big and dramatic ending twist is revealed. The epilogue of this movie doesnt even pose the challenging questions that the book did. So what the heck?

On a strictly serious note, it is possible Enders Game was a book that was impossible to tell in movie format. It was, indeed, a challenging book that posed many hard questions that no movie studio would dare to ask people. But this is the nature of hard science fiction. It still puzzles me why more people don't notice the choppy plot line and character development.

Regardless, Enders Game is up there with Dune, I Robot, The Martian Chronicles, The Time Machine and Starship Troopers as one of the GREATEST science fiction novels of all time! You couldn't possibly believe that from watching the movie alone. As someone who believes in this book and this story, its my hope somebody reading this review will be spared the stupidity of this movie.",1428105600,2,3797,4.700751879699248

5515935,4,B00AW9MB4W,"""Ender's Game"" is a terrific learning tool for pre-teens and teens giving them valuable lessons on the morality of warfare.  Like any endeavor we should abide by a morally humane code of ethics when engaged in combat and battle exercises.  This theme runs throughout the film making a cogent argument unlike the cynical ""Hunger Games"" movies that decry violence yet wallow in it at the same time.  Good performances offered up by a stellar cast led by Asa Butterfield (""Hugo"") who gives a mature and knowing turn that belies his tender years.  If I were to fault the film it would be over length and though the effects and art direction impress they add a certain sterility to the proceedings.  Regardless, an intelligent film for its target audience that offers them food for thought to chew on.  I received this as a Christmas present from my brother which I found curious.

5515941,1,B00AW9MB4W,"Okay, I've never read the book, but they (the studio(s) who backed this) needed to appeal to more than JUST those folks who read, and liked, the book. After all, you're talking about 110 million dollars for this movie.
Taking that into account, this is just an implausible, nonsensical heap of garbage.
If you were to buy into this movie's premise, we should be recruiting junior high school kids to fly our military's fighter jets, and command our nuclear subs! Being really good at playing video games seems to be the only criteria.
So if that's to be believed, what the hell are ""we"" doing with only old guys running the program? I mean Harrison Ford and Kingsley were both about 70 when this movie was made. Let's get a couple 16 year olds to command this operation!
And we are told that Kingsley was the famous fighter pilot who ""defeated"" the ""bugs"" way back when. Given the average age of an Air Force fighter pilot, we can calculate that about 35-40 years had passed since that event.
So in 35-40 years we invented all this amazing technology? Oh wait, maybe they got kindergarten kids to invent and make all that stuff. Silly me.
What was I thinking?
I realize that the movie is based on a 1985 book, but I can't help seeing the connection to 9-11. They even have a sign in the background of one scene stating ""Never Forget"". I'm thinking that the sign wasn't in the book.
And the message I guess is: hug your enemy, don't be mean and attack them.
So at the end we are suppose to really admire Ender for his compassion on taking the Queen egg and trying to find another planet for that species to live happily ever after. Apparently Ender forgot about the million's of his own species that were killed by these ""bugs"".
And they promoted him to boot! Just shows that their recruitment program was fatally flawed.
In reality, the ""bugs"" will probably eat Ender, then repopulate their species and attack Earth again.

* Harrison Ford, probably the most famous of all time, puts in one of his best performance in this movie which is bolstered by a somewhat unknown Asa Butterfield who did a fantastic job in portraying a complex and deep character. The book portrayed him as a tragic character but I liked how Butterfield played his role in the movie.

* This is essentially an underdog story. If you like how the underprivileged, and the weak, rising up, then this movie will certainly resonate with you. The main character rose in strength due to his incredible talent and perhaps some luck when the Director spotted his talent.

* The graphics are decent and amazing, especially that of the last scene. This is a believable story set in the future of the Earth and there is bound to be a sequel given how the movie ended.",1425772800,,1040,4.463157894736842

I am haunted by the choices some characters make, for themselves, for others (like Ender), and for their own and other species; and I carry away with me thoughts about how the results of those choices will affect those characters even after the movie's conclusion.

5516256,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Ender's Game is a mostly enjoyable science fiction just for the original concept alone.  A young boy played by Asa Butterfield with a talent for strategizing in relation to alien elimination and an ability to properly and fearlessly command leadership of his crew has to train hard to basically become the hero of the world much to the displeasure of his parents and siblings who are strongly against it.  Harrison Ford does a good job expressing forceful encouragement towards the young boy during the most critical of situations, and Harrison is the second strongest character in the movie without question.

I really think Asa Butterfield is amazingly talented.  This is the first movie I've ever seen him in.  I know he's done other films too.  I like how his high intelligence and constant alertness makes him question any and all actions which is actually what anybody should do in his situation.  His conversations with Harrison's character are really good as a result.  For a good chunk of the story- in fact for 75% of it, Asa's character goes through numerous training courses including laser beam shooting/no gravity floating madness with his mates in preparation for the alien invasion which provides some of the most interesting moments of the movie, and also confirms Asa's talent for strategy.

Of course because Harrison Ford accidentally mentions Asa as being the brightest of the group, his team doesn't necessarily welcome Asa with open arms and instead they express jealousy, anger and hatred for Asa's talents.  For a large chunk of the movie, Asa either has to persevere or defend himself against the more belligerent and disagreeable members of the team (some of which are even older than he is).  One thing I found odd is that Asa's amazing strategizing abilities were sometimes inconsistent.  Sometimes he'd be able to easily clean people's clocks by anticipating their punches ahead of time, while other times he either temporarily loses this ability or simply lets his guard down (or perhaps he lets his emotions interfere with common sense).  As a result, Asa sometimes struggles to defend himself against those who are picking on him.

The reason I'm not giving this movie 5 stars is because there's SO much story devoted to Asa's training to become the best, that when the time comes to actually face and eliminate the aliens, there's only 20 minutes of movie left.  So on one hand the character development was fabulous without a doubt because we see everything Asa's capable of both emotionally and strategically, but on the other the movie sort of fails to deliver a satisfying outcome that shows Asa taking full advantage of his skills for a considerable/sufficient period of time. A small complaint though, because otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed Ender's Game and highly recommend it for kids and science fiction lovers.",1420502400,,2854,5.029723991507431

5516314,3,B00AW9MB4W,"This movie created much anticipation upon its being announced that it was to be made. It is one of the very few Sci Fi novels I've read in the last 40 years (in spite of being a big fan in younger years). The problem is that unlike a lot of other movies, which can make use of unusual landscapes (Oblivion and Noah filmed in Iceland) this film, like ""Avatar"" and the Alien Series, takes place entirely in an artificial landscape, and yet its budget was less than half of the production budget of ""Avatar"". The commentary on the DVD makes constant reference to how tight they were with the budget. I have no idea how much they spent on salaries for Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley, but they probably could have saved a lot by substituting two good character actors for those roles, at perhaps 1/4 the cost.

On the whole, the ""live"" action works nicely. The problem arises with the dream / video game scenes. It often seems as if dream sequences are hard to integrate with awake time scenes. You are never quite sure if the character is or is not acting based on a dream. A similar problem occurs with the vision sequences in ""Noah"".

I think the movie may also suffer from the fact that the story in the book and the movie is based on a big surprise ending. And everyone who has read the book, knows the surprise, and the movie did not have the time available in the book to build up to that surprise. If I was not curious to see how well they did the book, I would not have bought this movie. I can recommend it if you have NOT read the book.",1419724800,,1542,4.2593856655290105

Plus I know full well that the mental and physical peak range is 18-25 years old. Not 13 or whatever these kids were. Add to that the fact that better decision making comes from EXPERIENCE, makes things seem far fetched to me.
There are just too many gaps, that are probably filled in by the book that would make Ford's decisions seem less rash.

5516373,4,B00AW9MB4W,"An adaptation from a book of the same name, Ender's Game just a pretty good job of translating to the screen.  If you are a fan of the book, you will not be entirely disappointed.

The major differences between the book and movie are as follows.  Ender's sister and brother play very minor parts except when interacting with Ender.  In the book, they are much more important. The number of battle room battles is condensed, leaving out some of the major impacts on Ender.  In the book, you feel his exhaustion, while the movie just shows him as tired.  Some of the characters are merged with one another to speed the movie along.  This, of course, also detracts from some of the internal battles Ender has to face.

All in all, I think the movie captures the major points of the book.  You have young boys being trained to fight a war while experiencing pressures beyond what they should be able to endure.  You have adults waging a war against a misunderstood enemy.  You have a surprise ending that reveals a dark result and impact on our main character.

The visuals are riveting.  You can sense the weightlessness in the battle room and the tension elsewhere.  The only real negative to the film is that we miss a ton of what is going on in Ender's head but that is expected since half the movie is him being isolated from everyone else.",1418774400,,1341,4.487603305785124

5516392,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I'm going to give it 4 stars instead of 3, just because I hope they make another one.  This movie however did not do the book justice.  I'm trying to put my finger on it.  The effects were fine, I did notice that people who read the book recently seemed to hate it much more than those who had read it a long time ago.  I fell in to the latter camp, and consequently wasn't quite as bothered by the changes they made. I guess my primary gripe is that everyone I watched it with just didn't feel for any of these characters.  If you can get in to it, I'm sure you'll like it just fine.

In terms of recent sci-fi movies chances are you'll enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy and Edge of Tomorrow so much better.  These are both great movies for all kinds of people, and everyone I've recommended them to has enjoyed them, even people who don't typically enjoy sci-fi or action like my sister.  And if you're looking for something a little more thought provoking you might want to try Interstellar (same director as Inception and the Dark Knight).",1418515200,,1039,4.319587628865979

Probably 90 percent of the story is not told in the movie. What is there could be confusing if you didn't read the book. Basically nothing more than another ""kill the aliens"" space opera. If would have taken very little additional screen time to add SOMETHING in the way of a background story so we could understand the characters a little more. The character development was the crux of the novel. You just don't get the story otherwise. The movie just leaves you wondering, ""Huh? what was that all about?"" This treatment of the novel is just plain lazy, sloppy and typical Hollywood (or is is Bollywood?). Decent special effects though. Watch it on a large screen with full surround and crank it up. It's the only way to enjoy this movie at all.",1418515200,2,923,4.566265060240964

Ender being LARGER and seeming older than most of the other kids really took away most or all of the tension.  I mean, he literally towers above the strangely-cast very short Bonzo.

The timing is very accelerated, as one would expect for a film, but in this case some very bad choices were made.  Most importantly, although there are a lot of battle scenes, we are given no indication of what makes Ender good as a soldier or leader.  The only thing he's shown to be good at is shooting, after 30 seconds of instruction from Petra.  And, even that is not very convincing.  Again, no tension, no concept of Ender as particularly good at anything (outside of Harrison Ford's grumbling comments).

Basically, we're told everything, rather than shown, and even the telling is flat and uninteresting. Ah well.",1416960000,8,911,4.7215189873417724

The buildup to the grand reveal is less dramatic than the original short story. But then that's the same in the novel length version. I read the short story when I was quite young, and I'm now on the edge of old. So most viewers are not about to be surprised, must less shocked by the reveal, which I shall not spoil, just because.

But I had trouble with the ending, more specifically the sense of remorse in the film.  This situation is portrayed as live or die situation for humanity.  I found somewhat difficult to believe that the human of this conflict would feel so much guilt over their actions.  Especially in view of the fact that Harrison fords character was filling these young recruits with a desire to destroy their enemy before they could be destroyed.  Other than that one issue, it was a very enjoyable film, with some great special effects.  I recommend this film , for the special effects alone.  JRV",1413590400,,754,4.746153846153846

I am, unfortunately, one of those people that is almost always disappointed by the film version of my favorite books. This film was a dramatically condensed version of the text, but it did well to capture the horror of the book.

A few notes:
- The visuals were stunning and I think they did well to capture the feeling of the universe.
- I wanted to see more of the ""tactics"" that they used to dominate as Dragon Army and more Battle Room action in general.
- They omitted the Peter/Valentine sub-plot entirely.
- Spoilers: there was also way too much allusion to the final exam being more than a simulation.
- They also used ""drones"" instead of humans in the fighters. It tempered the revelation of the horrific choices that Ender had to make.
- I quite enjoyed the sound track and will likely purchase that as well.

Overall, I would consider this a movie that is worth seeing once. It might not hold a place of honor on my shelf, but it was enjoyable.",1412899200,2,1025,4.441489361702128

I was a little annoyed by him ""losing"" in command school; the whole greatness of Ender was that he never lost.

The movie was refreshingly clean (though the overall theme was serious and dark at times; not necessarily in a bad way) and extremely thought provoking. The plot line made some unexpected turns, so don't worry about it being clich! I also loved the acting; it was so good I didn't even think about the story being a movie.

5516887,3,B00AW9MB4W,"When a film comes out that's based on a book, I usually prefer the book over the movie.  In this case, however, I went into ""Ender's Game"" without having read the book first and only knowing a vague outline of its plot.  This means that it's impossible for me to judge this movie as an adaptation, as I don't know what strengths and flaws of the film are its own merits and what are successes and failings of the original novel.  So I'll be reviewing ""Ender's Game: The Movie"" as its own animal, and perhaps save the book for another review further down the road.

As a movie, ""Ender's Game"" is an enjoyable bit of eye candy, but it feels very generic.  I can see where they were trying for a story with epic scope in the vein of ""Star Wars,"" but it came up very short.

Ender Wiggins is a boy enrolled in a school for cadets, where gifted kids compete for the right to become soldiers in the upcoming war against the Formics -- aliens who attacked Earth fifty years ago and who may very well come back to attack again.  Unbeknownst to Ender, he's being watched by Colonel Hyrum Graff, who believes he may be the key to winning the war and selects him to attend battle school.  Battle school is brutal and highly competitive, encouraging ruthless competition and driving its students to win at all costs.  Under the Colonel's watch Ender goes from a skinny, weak rookie to a keen-eyed strategist, and soon ends up in command during a high-stakes war game on a distant world.  But the true nature of Ender's training will come as a brutal shock... and he will learn that victory comes at a heavy cost.

The visuals and special effects in ""Ender's Game"" are decent, if not particularly stunning or imaginative.  In my opinion special effects work best if they can make you forget you're watching CGI, such as with films like ""Pacific Rim"" and ""The Avengers.""  ""Ender's Game"" never reached that level for me -- I could admire the pretty effects but never lost myself in them or forgot I was just watching pixels on a screen.  That, and everything looks oddly generic, with few of the visuals standing out as imaginative or unique.  The Formics themselves came the closest, and I wish we could have seen more of them.

The acting is rather stiff and wooden as well.  Asa Butterfield tries his hardest in the role of Ender, and he makes the hero a likable young man with guts and brains as well as a good heart, but he's one of the few bright spots in the film.  Harrison Ford is mostly just playing a grouchy old man in this film, and his gruff and flat performance makes me long for his Han Solo and Indiana Jones days.  Ben Kingsley is virtually wasted as Mazer, a war hero who aids in Ender's training, and pretty much plays a Harrison Ford clone.  Everyone else seems to just be muddling along, phoning in their performances and picking up their paychecks at the end.  The acting's not quite as bad as that of a ""Star Wars"" prequel, but it's nothing phenomenal either.

As another reviewer mentioned, the film feels rushed.  I can understand that they were trying to incorporate as much of the book as possible into a two-hour film, but if they had to rush to do it, then maybe they should have split the film between two movies instead of cramming everything into one.  Ender's progression in such a quick time feels unnaturally fast, though I'm not sure if this is the fault of the story or the rapid pace of the film itself.  And little plot hints strewn throughout are never fleshed out -- it makes me wonder if they were intending on a sequel, but said plot hints are left dangling at the end and make the film feel unfinished.

Also, the climactic reveal of the film seems to come straight out of nowhere, and felt jarring to me.  Not the twist itself -- it was brilliant -- but the fact that it felt like there was little to no buildup to said twist.  A little foreshadowing would have been nice.

I don't know how this film compares to the original book, but I'd be lying if I said the film didn't at least make me curious about the book.  It's not a great film by any means, but it did entertain me, even if it left me wishing for a little more meat to the story and the world itself at the end.  I'd wait until this one hits the $10 movie bin before buying.",1410825600,,4267,4.376903553299492
5516888,5,B00AW9MB4W,Bought this movie after seeing it in theaters. Also because  the lead actor has my last name. Very good dvd. I wish the second  movie will come out soon so I can buy that,1410825600,,170,3.9705882352941178

5516890,4,B00AW9MB4W,"The theme of this movie is the moral conflict between violence and compassion. This conflict is personified early in the movie by Ender's violent brother and compassionate sister but is most critical to the plot in Ender's internal conflict as he tries to balance the two traits within himself. The pro-military society which developed after the human race was almost destroyed fifty years earlier by an invasion from space also plays heavily into the theme. The theme is also present in the way Colonel Graff and Major Anderson debate how Ender is treated during training. I will also add here that if you follow the physiological manipulation Colonel Graff uses to achieve his ends you might view the movie as being a physiological thriller in a science fiction setting.

All of the acting in the movie was great. I was especially impressed by two of the child actors: First Asa Butterfield, his facial expressions plainly showed his feeling of isolation and fear as well as his determination and his calculating mind; Secondly I was impressed by Moises Arias, it is rare for me to feel compassion for a character who is plainly a bully but Moises Arias pulled that off. I did not feel anywhere near the level of compassion for him which Ender felt but enough to understand Ender's reaction. Since the idea of Ender feeling compassion for the bully ties in with the overall theme it was an important characteristic.

However the movie did not fully explain why they were training children in their earlier teens to be the International Fleet Commander nor did it really show why Ender was that special. At the same time I did feel early in the movie that something was missing, and I now feel that what I missed was reading the book before watching the movie. I watched this movie with almost no prior knowledge of the story. I had watched some interviews with some of the cast along with some short clips and a little ""making of"" footage, but not enough to really explain anything. Ben Kingsley's brief interview and the special effects are what caught my attention.

After watching the special-features and both commentaries included on the Blu-ray I now understand the theory of training the young teens as commanders. I still find it a little far fetched, but I understand that the book and the movie are targeting preteen to early teen audiences which would be far more accepting of the theory. I can set-aside by doubts in the theory and enjoy the movie on its terms once I understand its terms. The same thing goes for Ender's special abilities, they are more fully explained in the special-features, and apparently were more fully explained in the book. I also gathered from the special-features that the main problem in fully addressing these very important plot points was time, as it is the movie is almost two hours long. I think the book should have been divided into three movies, one for the first school which was almost totally skipped by this movie, one for the battle school, and one for command school.

The movie's second strongest feature (the first being the superb acting) is its special effects, they are great, especially in battle school. This would be another reason for making a full movie of just battle school, the special effects would be spectacular. The special effects in command school were also good but way to brief, if a full movie had been devoted for command school the special effects there would probably surpass battle school.

I watched the movie four times. Once with no outside knowledge of the story, then after watching the special-features I watched the movie with each of the two commentaries, and then I watched it again with the movie sound track. If you are not at all familiar with the story I would suggest watching the movie first because if you watch the special-features and commentaries first you would also gain knowledge which would detract from your enjoyment of the ending of the movie, but be sure to watch the special-features and commentaries afterwards to fill in the blanks.

One final thing, this movie reminded be strongly of three prior movies. First of all, the pro-military government and the war with bugs in space reminded me of ""Starship Troopers;"" using video games to train, and assess military candidates reminded me of ""The Last Starfighter;"" and Ender's use of  ""the little Doctor"" reminded me something in ""Star Wars,"" but to tell what would be a major spoiler.",1410739200,,4446,4.826771653543307

The story, although compressed into a movie format, was able to cover most of the main elements in a well presented and gripping story.  Harrison Ford does a tremendous job playing Hyrum Graff, the crusty officer in charge of training the children, determined to win at any cost.  Despite his height, Mois&eacute;s Arias is utterly convincing as Bonzo Madrid, the squad leader who promotes himself at cruel cost to his underlings.  Hailee Steinfeld brings beauty and life to her role as Petra Arkanian.  Ben Kingsley is perfect in his portrayal of Mazer Rackham, the exotic hero who saved the human race in the first invasion.  And Asa Butterfield is superb as the troubled yet genius military leader Ender Wiggins, who finds a way to win time and time again against impossible odds.  The special effects are exceptional, but never take front seat before the emotional drama of the story.  The formics are convincingly alien, in a creepy sort of way, without dominating the moral question being explored.  I highly recommend this film.",1410048000,,1101,4.908108108108108

5517006,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Ender's Game is one of my favorite novels. I was incredibly apprehensive when I learned that it was being adapted for film. Hollywood has a pretty notorious propensity to corrupt what made a novel brilliant when moving it to the big screen. This film is one of the few exceptions. It is by no means better than the novel, but it does a very respectable job of bringing the story and characters to life in a way that doesn't hurt the integrity of the source material. As always, material from the novel had to be cut or modified to fit the new medium's storytelling mechanism, but none of it was detrimental. The story and characters stand on their own and I'm confident that, as a whole, it strongly stands on its own.

The world represented is a believable future. The planet has been invaded by an alien race and was almost brought to extinction. Since then the world has banded together to form a unified Alliance Fleet dedicated to protecting the planet from future attacks. Part of this initiative is to train children to be war leaders, as they can assimilate information better than adults and can grow up learning war tactics and stay on the cutting edge of technology. This sets up the plot of Ender's Game, which revolves around one boy who has been secretly regarded as the ""chosen one"" destined to rid the world of our former invaders.

The visuals are incredible and do a good job of representing the reference material. Plenty of scenes in this film were strong representations of what I imagined Ender's world to look like. The environments and characters are convincing. The story is harsh and cruel and really shows the actor's skills. Asa Butterfield is absolutely spot-on with his performance as Ender, he is strong-willed and uses all his pent-up emotions to bend the rules and fuel his passion to prove himself. My only complaint in characterization comes from the mild feeling of love interest we see between two characters who, in the novel, are completely platonic.

The story has good pacing, just as the novel does. It wraps up relatively succinctly, with a feeling of accomplishment and revelation. It leaves the door open for a sequel, although the novel's sequel ""Xenocide"" would be almost impossible to adapt to film and retain the right ""feeling"".",1408752000,,2278,4.776649746192893

5517040,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I read Ender's Game many years ago and it was one of those books that stuck with me even though I'd forgotten many of the details. I was looking forward to the movie but decided to take a refresher course and re-read Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead before watching the movie.

Ender's Game relies a lot on the reader understanding, or at least being carried along with, the minute emotional details, interactions, and perspective of Ender Wiggins and those around him, especially Ender's brother and sister. The book could easily (like many well written books) have become an 8 hour mini-series or at least a movie trilogy.  Unfortunately, it wound up being much shorter and the trade-offs were noticeable.

The movie did follow the general path of the book and it did appear that there was a real attempt at getting the major points from the book into the movie. While the movie can certainly stand on its own it was rushed and became the telling of the highlights of the story rather than the story itself.

The environment that was created at the Battle School and Command School felt right compared to what I imagined from the book although I'd always imagined the Battle Room to be much darker and not quite as packed with stuff.  With a couple of well known names (Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley) helping to support the film the rest of the cast did a reasonably decent job of portraying their characters although, again, without as much depth and detail as the characters in the book. I could be wrong but it seemed to me that the character Harrison Ford played, while important and key to the book, was more predominate in the film than in the book.

If you're into space based science fiction with a moral this movie is worth watching. It's not meant to be Star Wars and while I think the story could be considered ""epic"" the follow-up books probably won't make it to film since they are less epic space battle and more political and psychological drama.",1408233600,,1969,4.611428571428571

5517083,5,B00AW9MB4W,"First off, I never read the book. This probably worked in my favor, as movie adaptations usually do not live up to the standards of novels. They simply can't due to time limitations. While a writer can several pages of glorious details, movies can portray the same idea in a matter of seconds. They are two completely different types of media, so crossing means something is lost during the conversion. But I digress...

I knew nothing about Ender's Game prior to watching the movie.

Who is Ender?

Ender Wiggins, the third born son in his family. I use the term born loosely, because the movie almost made it seem like he was created rather than conceived. He has two older siblings, a brother who enjoys beating up Ender (quick to use violence) and sister (Abagail Breslin) who is very compassionate. Because of these tendencies, his siblings failed the commander training. Ender was the family's, and perhaps humanity's, last hope.

Commander training, what?

Not exactly sure the name of it, but it basically entails sending young teenage kids into war school where they are taught the ""rules of war"". Only the best proceed to the next level. It turns out, Ender has a gift for war far beyond the capabilities of his classmates. He steadily moves up the ranks and ultimately gains control of the entire human fleet to face the ""invading"" bugs.

The movie itself was visually amazing. The practice room the cadets train is nothing short of spectacular. It looked like a glass enclosed dome floating in outer space. To make it even cooler, you could see the planets in the background as the kids practiced their skills. How cool is that!?

The war room at the end was also visually amazing. It helped the viewer feel like they were witnessing the war at home. Quite a feat!

The only part of the movie that surprised me was how little they used Abagail Breslin. Her name appears prominently on the movie box and in trailers, yet she only appeared for maybe 10 minutes for the entire movie. And I read somewhere that she made almost 200k for her role. Where can I find a gig like that!?

I hope they decide to continue this saga and lead us on the adventure along with Ender. If not, the movie has me so interested in the series that I have already borrowed the second book. Maybe at some point, I'll read the first and compare the two.",1407974400,,2338,4.600961538461538

5517090,3,B00AW9MB4W,It's an okay adaptation.

5517091,3,B00AW9MB4W,"I was not surprised to see the Harry Potter comparisons in many of the reviews of this film. I thought the same exact thing being a fan of the entire Ender book series. My movie comparison might be sort of like Disney creating a condensed sugar coated representation of Lord of the Flies...in space. We all generally know its a challenge to distill the imagination and depth of story into a movie script, one has to allow for some deviation. Yet, along these lines, the pulp, grit, action, and harder science fiction are lost to what I consider the detriment of a much greater story. The standalone movie itself is OK, better if you never read the book, the acting is good enough, the effects are great. The book story seems more from an adult perspective (or a kid being forced into adult perspective telling it), more than a ""tough"" story for kids like Hunger Games, but this is the end result on the big screen. Many key plot elements were revised or left out entirely, the focus of the story diverted from intense tactical and virtually inhumane psychological training/conditioning, tension and sub-stories surrounding Ender's rise to leadership, his darker family history, severe emotional/moral conflicts, etc. All at an age traditionally considered way too young to process these things. Ender's training begins at 6 in the book not age 15-16. These aspects have been almost totally glossed over to produce an interesting looking movie about an extended Quidditch match in space. Stun guns, fancy suits, ham handed clich stock militaristic dialogue taking the lead in the story over deeper content. I'd say reading the book prior will lead to disappointment, reading it after may provide insight. Whatever you may think of Orson Scott Card's political statements, which I admit I don't agree with him, they seem to have influenced how far they could go representing a book that made you really think...to producing a movie that does not require you to.",1407542400,,1959,4.921450151057402

5517155,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I remember when Ender's Game the novel was released in 1985 but had never read it and so was unfamiliar with the story other than it's part of a series.  Therefore, I was disappointed that, except for a brief voice-over commentary at the beginning, there's not much background about Ender...why his father's such a distant AH, and why it's so important for this one child to be the one from their family to be taken into the training program. Blurbs for the book say Ender and others are specifically bred for the program. Nothing is mentioned of that in the movie. Ender's sister was smart but failed and Ender's brother had the necessary violence but was unable to keep it in check properly. Ender has the intelligence and the violence though once he loses his temper, it stays lost and he has a bit of a problem with authority from someone he considers less intelligent than he. This is apparently what the Powers that Be are looking for so Ender is soon not only in the program but candidate to lead the entire armada against the invaders, who by the way, were quelled 50 years before and haven't been heard of since. Since most of the recruits are under the age of 15, one shudders at the idea of an armed forced manned by people without the mental or emotional maturity to make such life-and-death decisions whether they're in the right or not. Endor appears around 13. A 13-year-old Admiral of the Fleet...? God help us all!

So why stir up trouble, if the attackers are no longer attacking?  The Man in Charge wants to make certain they never get it into their alien brains to do so again, though half a century has now passed.

It all seems to boil down to Never Trust Anyone in a Uniform (or in this case, an adult) especially if he's a zealot like Graff appears to be. Ender is continually placed in situations where he's bullied and beaten and he always wins because his temper takes over. Generally the violence aimed at him seems completely uncalled for. Anyone in authority automatically hates him on sight. One wonders how any military force could be successful with that attitude from the unit's commanding officers.

It's an entertaining film though I'm told it deviates from the novel in important ways. It does have a certain sterile quality to it however, as well as  bit of a prophetic quality in that all the recruits, besides their intelligence, are all adept at video gaming a la The Last Starfighter. There's very little emotion in Ender's Game except for anger, generally evoked through unreasonable means.  The open ending makes it certain the rest of the quintet will probably follow.",1406419200,,2613,4.655097613882863

5517158,3,B00AW9MB4W,"As a disclaimer, I read the book and then watched the movie, and I liked the book pretty well (probably 3.5 to 4 stars for the book). Also, SPOILER ALERT.

The movie was ok. Special effects were cool and I really like how they brought the training room to life, making it far more realistic, epic, etc than it did in my imagination when I read the book. Also, capturing Ender's calculating nature was done excellently in my opinion, though we are missing out on a lot of the character development, A LOT of Ender's commanding skills, and some of the competitive/vindictive spirit that Ender actually had in the book. To be fair, it makes sense that they would cut a lot of it out for the sake of the story, but they seemed to unnecessarily rush his progression through commanding positions. For example, Ender is given command of his own team in the training room and they only have one mission. That is an enormous truncation of the book's story. Even some sort of brief look at a series of victories would have been more helpful and less like the act of giving him his own team was just some sort of minor test (it was a test, true, but not so minor).

The room in which he commanded ships to attack the aliens was probably the best part in terms of effects and visual awe. They did really well with that part.

While I understand their reasoning behind cutting out the brother's and the sister's respective stories from the book for the sake of Ender's personal story (after all, it is his movie), Ender's siblings played important roles in the books, especially when it came to the very end of this part of the story. I can't help but feel they could have somehow incorporated more about his siblings without detracting from Ender's story. After all, part of the reason the story ends as it does is because he was on a trip with his sister. With his brother only playing a tiny role as bully at the end, there was no chance for his own story of excellence, his redemption and his heart-wrenching apology that appeared in the book; I found it quite tragic to cut out the real personality and humanity of the mean brother and just to reduce him to a bully with a few scenes.

Overall, I thought it was a good, not great movie, and I think they definitely could have done better including some parts of the book without rushing the story or diverging too much from Ender.",1406160000,,2372,4.43348623853211

Most cinematic SF is crap, and fails badly because the writers don't know how to write good SF...  OSC's script is excellent, and the entire cast & production-crew did it proper justice.

5517200,5,B00AW9MB4W,"Orson Scott Card is a good writer, but a better story teller.  The movie adaptation of ""Ender's Game"" is surprisingly and refreshingly faithful to the book (not 100%, but still).

Some people are put off by the book and the movie because of the violent nature of some of the interactions between child characters.  That, frankly, is central to the storyline.  Humans are at war, or are preparing for war against an alien force that nearly wiped humans out decades earlier.  Military and political leaders concluded that their best chances against a largely unknown enemy was to recruit children with the ability to think creatively and ruthlessly to lead Earth's space fleet.  With that, the stage is set...

Harrison Ford plays his role perfectly as the crusty commander of the training school and foil to Ender.  Ben Kinglsey is fantastic as Mazer Rackham, here of the first battle and Ender's mentor.  And Asa Butterfield is a great Ender Wiggin.  I also enjoyed seeing Emily Breslin in a more grown-up role as Valentine Wiggin, Ender's older sister.

While there were many top-notch movies that came out in 2013, Ender's Game was probably my favorite.

Viewers should be advised that this movie contains is potentially disturbing violence between children.

As someone who loves the books, I was incredibly disappointed with their treatment of the material and how little they developed the characters.  And if it was for people who haven't read the books....I don't understand how it could be enjoyable to them either!  There was so little character development that unless you were just watching it as a ""shoot stuff, watch things blow up, sci fi movie"", why the hell would you have cared about the story or what happens to any of these characters??  And Ender's reaction at the end of the movie would make no sense because you had no understanding of how that decision would have impacted him as a person because you had no real sense of him as a person other than ""he is good at war stuff"".  And don't even get me started on the trailers of the movie giving away the ending!!!

All in all, I feel like the makers of this movie tried to stay true to the book, but the only way to do that was by giving a super sterile cliff's notes version of the book which totally stripped it of its meaning and the characters of their humanity.

It recruits promising ones to go through academy training.

The enemy is superior in most respects, and the adult leaders have good reason to fear our next battle with them may well be a decisive defeat unless we can find a truly unique strategist who can make the best use of our space fleet in general as well as one newer weapon we hope the enemy doesn't know we have.  Of course Ender is the chosen kid.

The adult roles are somewhat lacking in originality but the specials are good, the action is paced fast enough, and at the end, I liked this film.  I'll avoid giving away any important plot elements, but if you enjoy science fiction (the kind with aliens, space travel etc) then you will probably enjoy this film.",1405555200,,1064,4.528795811518324

5517263,4,B00AW9MB4W,"While the movie was decent enough on its own merit I was slightly taken back by the ending. It was not revealed until the end that the battle was for real, instead of just being a game. This in and of itself was fine and I can understand the logic of doing so. But my lack of overwhelming enjoyment came from turning what could and should have been a joyous celebration into a personal agenda promoting the horror of genocide. We are led to believe at the end that an injustice was done and woe is me all the while fighting an enemy that had decimated the earth 70 years before. Now we must deal with the conclusion that somehow we did something wrong.

This is one of the current prevailing trends in movies today.........directors take what could be an excellent movie and attempt to twist it around to suit their personal agenda and want to use it as a podium to promote their thoughts and views. While anyone is free to think what they want, please don't try to push it off on me through your directing. If you want to make some type of political statement, then do a documentary or something, not a movie and then twist the last 5 minutes and ruin everything.

As a result of this, I watched two hours or so and enjoyed literally everything, got engaged with the character development, could empathize with Ender and then was let down and left empty at the conclusion. If the movie had ended on a positive note with a celebratory victory over incredible odds, it would have been excellent. Granted, I have never read any of the books being a somewhat older generation, but the movie could have stood on its own.",1405036800,,1616,4.437710437710438

5517294,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I saw the movie before I read the book so this may have a different point of view from other reviews. The movie is about how this alien race known as the Formics or Buggers invaded earth fifty years ago. The I.F. starts a program to breed kid geniuses to become a battle commander who can battle the Formics. Ender Wiggin is one of those kids. He goes through training at this space station which is the Battle School. After his training at Battle School he goes to Command School where he learns how to fight the Formics.

There are a lot of differences between the book and the movie. First of all, Ender is six in the book, not twelve. His training also takes a lot longer in the book than in the movie. The aliens are called the Formics in the movie and not the Buggers. Personally I like Formics more. In the book Bonzo died, but in the movie he was injured. There are more but it would take forever to write them down. Those are main differences.

Overall I'd say it was a good movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes sci_fi movies and books.",1404777600,,1053,4.233830845771144

5517301,3,B00AW9MB4W,"This summer I had to read Ender's Game as a summer assignment. I enjoyed the thought provoking characters and the complex plot immensely. After I finished this book I wanted to watch the movie to get an idea of what the different scenes in the book would look like when created by Hollywood. I began watching the movie right after I finished the book because I was so excited. To my dismay they distorted the characters making them something they aren't, and even worse mixed up the order of when things really happened. For example, Bean wasn't in Enders launch group. He became part of the book later on when he is assigned to be part of Ender's army. I was thoroughly disappointed with the way they dumbed down the movie; leaving out Ender's thoughts-- one of the most important parts of the book because it shows how much of a genius Ender is. All in all I don't recommend this movie if you have already read the book.  Your imagination gives you a much better image and idea of what is going on, and the actors were  uninformed about the roles they were given. If you have not taken the time to read this book, and don't plan on doing so, I suggest watching the movie. However, you will be missing out on the best part of the book, the thought provoking and complex ideas. Overall, I think it was a poor representation of the book.",1404518400,,1336,4.4048582995951415
5517302,2,B00AW9MB4W,"An OK movie, but ultimately the subtle message of the books and the internal struggles of Ender are hard to be conveyed in a short motion picture.  Knowing something of the books I was able to fill in the missing information for the most part, but I can see that if I'd known nothing this would have been very confusing. The lessons learned they showed did not have the desired response.

Aside from not hitting the books very well, it was predictable, and not from my knowing the book standpoint, it was Hollywood predictable.  Not to mention within that scope a very weak finish.  Maybe the books and the recentness of them will help drive this for future, but box office losses in the millions do not make investors happy.  This movie had much more advertisement than recent box office Sci Fi flops such as Serenity, and Serenity was a much better movie based on the critics and fans who did see it.

It's too bad, other movies like John Carter, had it preceded Avatar, had a better cast, and been named The Princess of Mars like the books, it might not have lost a ton at the box office.  Now all those other Edgar Rice Burroughs non-Tarzan books will take many more decades before someone decides to film one.  Enders will probably share the same fate.  All you can say now is try again someday.  It took nearly 50 years to make a good movie trilogy out of the Lord of the Rings despite many poor animated attempts, so there is still hope.  Not recommended unless you're just a fan who wants to own the only movie.",1404518400,2,1519,4.428057553956834

5517327,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Ender's Game gets the Hollywood treatment and realizes my worst apprehensions. I'll give it this: the movie's good, but it's not great. It's bleak and humorless and takes itself way too seriously. Orson Scott Card's classic 1985 novel is my favorite sci-fi YA read of all time, and, in my opinion, the silver screen treats it rough in places. It would've better served the source material were this instead a show serialized on HBO rather than a 2-hour motion picture. So many anticipated things from the book were barely touched on or simply glossed over.

I wonder if the ""We are not alone"" contingent were gratified when the chitinous alien race darkened our skies fifty years ago. Humanity barely eked out a win in the Formic War and, since then, deepest paranoia has incentivized us. Somewhen between then and now Earth's International Fleet has brainstormed a new and radical approach. Today, humanity rests its hope on its children. The reasoning: a child's brain is more adaptive, more cognitive, more intuitive, can integrate complex data more easily than adults. A program is founded to train and groom genius children into the next great military commanders. It's Earth's best response for when the swarming Formic horde inevitably re-invades.

Here's Andrew Wiggin, here's Ender (Asa Butterfield). After a messed-up mind game or two, he's recruited to Battle School, that space station wherein he's expected to fiercely compete with other child prodigies for that rare selection to Command School. Ender comes from a genius family. He's the third Wiggin sibling to be admitted to Battle School. His brutal and unstable brother, Peter, and his compassionate sister, Valentine, had both washed up. It bodes horribly for Ender that he's viewed by the military academy's harsh taskmaster, Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford), as THE best hope for humanity in the coming war. Colonel Graff means to test Ender, to mess with Ender, to push him to the breaking point.

It's bemusing that Indiana Jones and Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) play second fiddle to some kid. Except that the kid turns in real credible work here. Asa Butterfield is focused, His expressiveness makes Ender an open book for us. You observe the spirit-shattering toll his stint at Battle School inflicts on him. I still say Asa's too old to play the part.

The best bits concern the null gravity war games held at Battle School, which are these visually arresting, smartly choreographed sequences. I wish the film had staged even more mock battles.

The impartial movie audience - mostly those who haven't read the book - will be more receptive towards the movie. It's got a compelling lead and an irresistible, thought-provoking premise, and a whiff of The Last Starfighter and Starship Troopers. The f/x is impeccable.

But I've read the book and I feel protective about the book. I think, ultimately, the movie doesn't do it justice. The heebie-jeebies you feel from these kids talking like adults is largely because the story barely makes an effort to depict these kids - other than Bean and Petra - as Ender's intellectual peers (which they are supposed to be). In fact, from jump Ender is projected as this very special, best-of-the-best type of war leader, and yet the film doesn't do enough to make him earn it. There are serious editing issues. The story feels rushed. You get no sense of how much time elapses. We see Ender rapidly go from a raw ""launchie"" to being promoted to squad leader to suddenly holding all the top scoring records in the game. But without the proper time reference, his evolution just feels too abrupt.

More nitpicks: It's petty but it bugs me that the movie doesn't explain the root of the ""Ender"" nickname. It's like this: When Valentine was very young, ""Ender"" was the closest she got to pronouncing ""Andrew."" And ""Ender"" stuck.

I waited in vain for someone, anyone, to refer to the Formics as ""buggers.""

Harrison Ford seems engaged as the brusque, calculating Colonel Graff whose eye never strayed from the big picture. He makes a good foil for Asa and you resent but get the motivation behind Graff's deliberately damaging actions. You know why he isolates Ender. The book dives even more into it. For example, in the book, no sooner does Ender get comfortable with a group than Graff rips him out of it and reassigns him to a new group. And Ender has to start from scratch, earn everyone's respect all over again. The movie also brushes aside the second guessing and the remorse and paternal warmth that Graff comes to feel towards Ender in the book. Too bad, it would've humanized Graff more.

In the end, there simply isn't room to adequately plumb the richness and complexity of Ender's Game. Barely touched on are the eugenics aspect, the ansible technology, and society's totalitarian state. Valentine and Peter's roles are criminally marginalized. Instead, Petra (Hailee Steinfeld), Ender's Battle School ally, serves to occupy Valentine's space. Petra becomes Ender's emotional bulwark. Ugh, okay, enough picking at the edges. I say, go watch the movie. I know I've bagged on it pretty mercilessly. I give it an above-average 3 - maybe 3.5 - out of 5 stars. It's got stuff going for it. It delivers the sci-fi thrills. The lead acting is solid. But after watching the movie, do read the book and see how much got left out. Then maybe you'll feel like I feel. The movie's good, but it's not great.

Instead, it has a totally different plot, with a totally unique story, but you buy into it easily, just like the newest Battlestar Galactica series. It keeps you engaged, guessing and holy cow - the acting is everything you want - ESPECIALLY from the children, which is even more rare these days.

The movie makers also were apparently combining some of the elements from ""Ender's Shadow"" (Bean's story) with Ender's Game, and I do understand that a story about 4--7 year old geniuses wouldn't sell as well as one about pre-teens and the book dealt with some really adult themes such as murder and other stuff that many parents wouldn't have wanted presented to children who were the same age group as those in the book so ""aging up"" of the main characters was understandable.

5517348,2,B00AW9MB4W,"I just saw this movie yesterday. It seems to have been written to appeal to the 8 to 12 year old age group, which is fine. It's just that the script logic and development also seem to have been written by 8 to 12 year olds. The nature of science fiction requires us to surrender our sense of the possible and entertain the thought of what is normally considered to be the impossible. That said, the movie still goes outside and beyond reason once it has established its' premise.

Instead of being a child Ender is a prepubescent pretty boy. He is not ignorant of what is happening, which is one of the things that make the original story so morally ambiguous, he is quite well aware that he is belong trained to run the show. The script is plebeian and the special effects cannot make up for the poor acting and plodding direction. Maybe one day it will be remade iby someone like Joss Whedon.

The boy thought it was all a game with no consequences until it was all over, and then he went on  a mission of peace. Those in charge of the boy didn't care what they would do to the boy mind, but cared about the outcome of the battle.  The commander destroyed the innocence of youth for the end result.

Granted, the best was done with what visual media has to offer.  Well-suited actors were chosen for the parts.  The visual effects were well-rendered.  The soundtrack is impressive.  The translation from the book to a two-hour screenplay, however, remains as impossible today as it has been since Ender was first penned.  Card performed a rare feat in creating something unique and whole and complete within itself.

The actor playing Ender was pretty terrible and Alai was completely different from the character in the book.

There are few movies that really capture the essence of a book.  Patton with George C Scott was one, this is another.  There is great depth if you think about what really happened.  Was what the human race did to its children and the Formics ethical?  Orson Card Scott got it right years ago when he wrote the book that our youngsters who play video games all the time would be better at war that we oldsters who are to set in our ways and didn't spend half our young lives in front of a cousol.  Now we kill half a world away with RPVs.  Not so different from killing light years away without really being there.

It is believable. If you are under 30, it is probably very believable. It has a lot to do with computer games or iBox games and game strategy. The characters are believable and I'm glad Harrison Ford was in it because except for the other guy on the cover, who played in Schindler's List, the cast was brand new to me. Except for the kid who hits his head, who was one of the big eared people in Deep Space Nine, who did a very good job of acting.

I really liked the lead actor, the boy who wins the war. I liked the plot very much.

This is not a well made film. The dialog is wooden and the acting is uninspiring. The character arcs are not natural; things happen because the script says they should happen. No one and no scene comes from a believable place.

This movie does not invoke the general feeling of the book. No time is given to care for the characters. Too much time is spent on some things, and not enough time on others. There are no, 'aah, I see' moments. For example, when Ender is put in charge of his toon for the first time, he asks the drill seargant if his toon will really follow him. The seargant salutes him dramatically. But up till that point we had never seen Ender take the lead in anything. And the only interaction he had had up to that point with the seargant was asking questions and being subsequently yelled at.

First off, a group of teens training for the inevitable future war has a good premise, but these were just kids, essentially playing a video game out of Futurama. Ender's pubescent crackling voice was very irritating, and you never know if he's going to be the next Patton or the next Omar Bradley. He fights bullies and hurts them badly, then cries over doing it, treats his subordinates badly, then kisses up to them. Harrison Ford and Abigail Breslin were quite good, but not good enough to carry this one. Ben Kingsley, as the previous war's hero, is pretty much useless, and hard to understand with a very heavy South African accent. It was like listening to Sharlto Copley. Very good special effects, but like Battleship and Pacific Rim, it can't carry a flick. You know in the first 5 minutes (spoiler alert) that the last training game is actually going to be a preemptive strike on the bug aliens. It would make a better video game than movie.

In some ways, the movie is able to more simply explain the moral dilemma in the story, that to win, one has to know the enemy sympathetically, as the enemy knows itself/himself/herself; which amounts to loving one's enemy and therefore is it/he/she really an enemy ... to be annihilated?",1402099200,,803,4.962686567164179

This story was probably good in the book, but when I actually saw this movie I could not stand to watch it to the end.  The story was not the problem, it was the characters.  The characters were very two-dimensional, if you know what I mean.  Every character was pretty straight forward, there was no mystery to them, nothing to be revealed.  There was no conflict within the characters either.  All of the conflict was external.  In a movie about war this is a bad thing--every soldier, I don't care how old, has his baggage, and it does not all exist outside of him.  One would think a kid would have much more psychological problems after years of having to deal with such a bully, right?  I mean at least take the easy way out and give him some father issues!  While he may be an okay leader, I believe that a leader exists in much more than tactical prowess.  He leads his people because he has been through what they have been through.  Perhaps Ender was the perfect leader for his crew--they all appeared to have no problems, and so a leader with no problems must have been perfect for them.

If I cannot watch a movie all the way through, I cannot give it a good rating.  After some consideration I gave this game 2/5 stars, because the concept was pretty interesting--the execution was another story.

The book was certainly an entertaining little story, but to me it seemed like a little story.  Perhaps because of the extreme youth of the characters and their often age-unlikely behavior.  Intelligence doesn't imply maturity.  Anyway, I always thought the book was only so so.

So I went in with moderate expectations and I would say this movie exceeded them.  It was reasonably close to the book while at the same time managing to be a coherent story.  The acting was pretty good and the special effects were great.  It's hard to set such a crazy story and such crazy imagery onto film and I think they did a reasonable job at it.

5517522,1,B00AW9MB4W,"I rented and watched ""Ender's Game"" this weekend and the shortest verdict I can give is ""barf-worthy"".

Just like with Peter Jackson's crappy rendition of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I approached ""Ender's Game"" with low expectations and it still didn't manage to clear the bar.

It's not just that the movie sucks compared to the book. I was prepared to forgive it any trespasses against the literary work it was supposed to be based on. The problem is that the movie can't even stand on its own legs. Like so many Hollywood adaptations of books with cult following, this one also turned out to be overhyped, badly directed pile of CGI and wooden acting.

The greatest sin of ""Ender's Game"" is that it consistently fails to show instead of telling. Over and over, we are told how special Ender is, how smart and how empathic, how he's the only hope of the humanity, but there's only one scene, near the beginning, that even tries to provide us with any evidence.

Adding insult to injury, Gavin Hood does his best to destroy whatever life and spirit Orson Scott Card breathed into his characters. Even though every kid in the book is supposed to be smarter than average, the movie portrays most of the boys as dumb bullies, whereas the girls are mostly cosmetic. The most egregious examples are Peter Wiggin, who is portrayed as an archetypical jock with an extra helping of psychopathic tendencies; Valentine Wiggin, who is there only to play damsel in distress in order to motivate Ender to get back to being a soldier; and Petra Arkanian, whose primary role is to create some vague sexual tension between her and Ender. In a textbook example of Hollywood's casual sexism, Petra's participation in battles has been dumbed down to teaching Ender the rudiments of shooting -- after which he miraculously becomes the equivalent of a Matrix character in his very first battle -- and shooting the Little Doctor super-weapon in the final battle after everyone else on the team has done the hard work.

This is nowhere near the comprehensive list of the movie's flaws: I actually found myself making the ""Everything Wrong With Ender's Game"" video, in true Cinema Sins style, in my head, as I struggled to keep watching.

All in all, it doesn't matter whether you've read the book or not: you can skip the movie ""Ender's Game"" and your life will be better for it. There are countless better ways to spend two hours of your life.",1401235200,6,2424,4.718676122931442

They've combed the story very smooth, deleting darkness and rebellion, self-doubt, conflict, and large-scale institutional deception almost completely. Even the age of the protagonists, which in the book carried its own shock value, was changed and lost meaning.

As a long LONG time fan of this book, I was intrigued but dubious about the movie adaptation. I was delighted with the movie, from the fabulous visual effects to the amazing cast, excellent acting and artful handling of the big twist at the end. My husband and I rented it first, then we HAD to purchase the blu-ray. I watched the rental version 5 times! The blu-ray is absolutely worth it for the amazing quality of the visual effects. I read the book several years ago, but my husband did not, so it was VERY difficult for me to not give him any clues about the big twist ending. I managed to keep my mouth closed though and it was quite fun to see his shock and admiration for author Orson Scott Card's mind games.

I thought the casting was fantastic, particularly Harrison Ford and Viola Davis delivered excellent acting and complex characters. Ender was very believable and played with great emotional range by Asa Butterfield, who has a strong list of film credits for someone so young. Ben Kingsley was a little one-dimensional, but his character was not given much screen time.  One actor who did a great job with not much screen time and few lines was Nonso Anozie as Sergeant Dap (you might remember him from Game of Thrones (Xaro Xhoan Daxos in the city of Qarth). All of the child actors did great jobs with their roles.

Secondly: The movie will never be like the book. I didn't see this in theaters because I wasn't sure if it was going to be any good judging it from just the trailer. I highly recommend you see this movie as summation of the book and not as an in depth detailed depiction of said book. Enjoy it for what it is, and not for what it isn't.

So far I've only found one or two like references like when Harrison Ford explained to Ender why he was ""the One"" Ender replied, "" I guess this is the reason for which I was born.""

If you don't know about these subtleties it is still a very fine and well done movie.  Of course I loved the book even better. But who usually doesn't like the book better.

I'd recommend it but I'm going to check out your meaning and explanation of the movie next.
Happy Viewing.

5517651,3,B00AW9MB4W,"You know, when screenplay writers are trying too hard the audience can see through their efforts easier than when the screenplay just loses its own way.

Such is the case with Enders Game, an attempt to corral all the mindless gamers into watching a movie with big name acting and a not-so-noteworthy story notebook. Note that I do not give this screenplay the credence of a storyline because if that were the case, you would see it clearly during the piece.

Here we have a ""coming of age"", ""big bad government minions"", ""nasty bugs (I hope this trend fades away)"" and ""pubescent love interests""  all surrounded with CGI/super-sound to make the time pass quickly.

In short, this movie reminds me of those Italian movies that big name actors do when they want to make some easy money while on vacation on the seashore. Nice work if you can get it but way short of a story/characters of any lasting interest.

In a way, it's too bad that Orson Card wrote a novel so wonderful that a movie-making attempt would be fraught from the start. The book contained extensive detail about Ender's relationships with his family members, his academy friends and his superiors--not to mention the motivations of these characters--and the movie simply couldn't do justice to all that complexity. If I hadn't read the book beforehand, I think the movie would have been a disappointment.

The movie makes leaps in the plot that are disjointed. The on screen chemistry is just no there. The building of the drama leading to the major battle at the end was flat. Also there are so many things that the movie just doesn't address that would help make the movie move so much better.

I must give credit to the folks that translated this into a movie. They did the best job that could have been done. Don't bother watching it unless you have read the book. There are only two possible responses to this movie; 1. You didn't already know the story and have just watched a very  bland and puzzling scifi flick that didn't have much of a point or 2. You are knashing your teeth and pulling out your hair in agony because the story mostly followed the book in a valium induced coma sort of way.  You cry a single tear of grief because you realized about twenty seconds before the end credits start rolling that this movie will never ever shift out of granny gear.  So if you read the book and you had the above mentioned emotional response at least your emotion filled in the gaping hole left by the film's lack in that department. On a side note to the set designers, the battle room and many of the other sets were just visually waaaay too busy.

For some reason, authors and Hollywood like to think you can take the content of an awesome book and somehow fit it into 2 hours (Okay, Peter Jackson thinks he can do it 9 for the Hobbit, but that's another story).  The better option I believe would have been to do a short series on this.  Then they could have explored the emotions and all the cool stuff without triaging it for a 2-hour feature film.

There's a lot of unanswered questions in the movie and I do feel like it could have been done better. But condensing a book into a 2 hour movie is not easy.

5517784,3,B00AW9MB4W,"The special effects in this movie are great and the acting is top notch. The idea of transferring computer game skills to actual combat situations is intriguing.  But the plot itself is wobbly.  If this movie is trying to say something, I'm lost on what it is. Apparently the earth is or recently was under attack and is still at risk. Many were killed. Now they are recruiting the brightest children they have on earth to train to fight the invaders. Whether they are doing this because they don't have enough intelligent adults left is unknown. It is kind of an odd premise, considering how young and immature these kids are emotionally, as is very clear, though they may have above average intelligence and/or computer skills.  Ender Wiggin is apparently considered a genius and they want him to command their fleet against the enemy invaders to save the world.  Ender is a competent if not ingenious strategist, but he's also still a boy with feelings for his family and his friends.  The military encourages the boys to see each other as competition, not friends, which is odd because if anything the military in real life tries to build a sense of comaraderie among soldiers, who need to depend on each other in combat situations. Yet the major, who may be a psychologist, but whether she is, is not made clear, says they don't want Ender to think he can depend on others for help.  It's as though they are trying to turn him into a robot, without feelings or caring, in the belief that if they can do that, he would be more effective. That makes no sense at all.  The technological skill this future Earth society seems to possess would enable them to make robots and use them in combat or even for command if that was what they needed.  Society does tend to teach people, especially boys, to be stoic and not have feelings, and that's one way society creates mental illness in people, including and especially soldiers. So while the conflict is an intriguing one, the way Ender's mind is being manipulated is not unlike the way the minds of children are manipulated from birth onward - i.e. don't feel because feelings will cause you problems. Ender fights it but succumbs to save the world. What is the message or purpose in this? I have no idea.",1399507200,,2255,4.62

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

After watching 'Ender's Game' for the first five minutes and understanding the film's premise, my immediate reaction was 'Yikes!-- look's like I'm in for a long ride.' Yes I must confess that my initial impression that the premise was ludicrous, was borne out by the rest of the plot and attendant hokey character machinations. Why exactly does humanity choose to employ children to battle insect-like aliens (aka Formics) who attacked and almost successfully destroyed earth fifty years earlier? That's a good question for Orson Scott Card, the author of the original source material, who wrote the book (of the same title) which the movie is based on. It's an easier question for profit-hungry producers, who speculated that allowing prepubescent kids to act out their fantasies in what essentially is one monotonous video game on screen, would translate into mega-profits at the box office. At the end of the day, 'Ender's Game', only made a very small profit due to its reliance on a slew of computer generated effects.

As for the Ender's plot, it revolves around a kid who has the same apocalyptic sounding name (does it mean he 'ends' the threat of the alien invasion or earth is at an end?) Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin (played by an overly intense Asa Butterfield), is a cadet who catches the eye of Commander Graff, who sees potential in the reserved and thoughtful twelve or thirteen year old. Graff is played by Harrison Ford who manages to be unpleasant throughout, barking orders at Ender and generally conforming to the script's call to play the boss as a boorish martinet.

While in a regular training school, Ender gets into his first physical confrontation with classmate Stilson, after defeating him in a space ship simulation. He also impresses Graff's subordinate, Gwen Anderson, when he figures out how to defeat a giant troll-like creature in a 'mind game' program designed as a no-win scenario (the CGI-effects here, along with a later scene involving one of Ender's visions, are perhaps the best parts of the film).

Ender then graduates to the much more fancy battle school where students fire laser guns at each other in a giant sphere dubbed the 'Battle Room' in a zero gravity atmosphere. Kids who love video games will probably find all of this endearing but for me, most of it reminded me of the typical dated paeans to military school cadet culture (here now with the students dressed up in spacesuits). When Ender is appointed the 'commander' of his own band of 'misfits' and defeats his former commander, Bonzo Madrid (no, not Bonzo the chimp!) in one of those battles inside the sphere, the second clichd fight occurs between the two afterward, inside a shower room. Ender decides it's 'Bedtime for Bonzo' after he puts Madrid into a coma (again Commander Braff is impressed by Ender channeling his hardly utilized inner Rambo).

Ender ends up being promoted to Commander of all forces and is transferred to a base of a former Formic colony. There he meets Rackham, the legendary commander who found the key to defeating the Formics in the epic battle fifty years ago. Ben Kingsley manages to out growl Harrison Ford, as another over aggressive mentor assisting the heralded lap dog, Ender (and yes, Kingsley's atrocious tattoos all over his face, are certainly not endearing at all). I have no guilt feelings about revealing the film's deus ex machina, so SUPER SPOILERS are ahead: the simulation that Ender (along with all of his pals from Battle School) engage in, which annihilates the Formic planet, was for real.

Thus Graff turns out to be a true martinet, a stand-in for over-aggressive, right wing, American military types. Ender, however, feels horribly guilty about being duped into wiping out the Formics. He realizes that the earlier mind game scene he involves himself in, is right outside the base and after encountering a dying Formic Queen, he vows to take the Queen's egg and colonize a new world with it. Ender justifies his actions by claiming that the Formics attempted to communicate with him, before Graff and his minions did their 'dirty work'. The problem is the Formics did indeed try to destroy the earth's population but the film's scenarists provide no explanation as to the original reason for the invasion. Therefore, Ender's assumption that their attempt to communicate is not justification enough for him to save the Formic species. Ender is unable to refute Graff, who implicitly argues that any attempt to communicate could very well have been a ruse.

Unfortunately, the idea of kids being put in charge of a fighting team in place of adults, seems to be an absurd conceit. And at a certain point, it isn't difficult to figure out that the filmmakers intentionally allowed Ender to take the moral high ground after he gets oh so 'touchy feely' with the that one last Formic egg (damning Graff for encouraging the kids' aggression, deceiving them but not explaining why he was wrong in the first place about the danger of another Formic invasion).

There were a few moments here and there which were nicely done, particularly Ender's mind game where he encounters the Formics for the first time inside the castle that was destroyed during the initial invasion. But watching juveniles beat each other up or blast one another in simulated war games, was not my cup of tea. This despite the films' scenarists wishful thinking that killing is bad if you don't give a dangerous, former adversary, a chance to redeem themselves, in the face of the flimsiest of evidence. Others might dub all this 'liberalism run amok'; as for me I'll simply return this disc to Netflix as fast as possible and move on to something more worthwhile!",1399248000,,5750,4.913491246138002

I was thrilled when they told me it was going to become a movie, because honestly, we have the technology to make it a great one. This was not a great one. It was good. But not great.

Pros:
Good casting. (Although anything with Harrison Ford is going to get my vote)
The battle room was spectacular. It looked like what I had pictured in my head and then some. I loved it.
Ender was portrayed as conflicted, which is great. And they did a good job showing how he started to gain the confidence from the other kids at the school.
Mazer Rackham came off as awesome however I hate the part about the facial tattoos. Fine and all but it seems just like a cheap way to try and push the next ""Speaker for the Dead"" movie. Not in the book. Just stupid.

Cons:
There was not enough information on Ender's connection to his family (why was being a 3rd important) Who cares that his brother was a little mean? Why didn't his parents make a bigger stink about him leaving...etc.
When watching the movie the time he spends at Battle School seems like he is there only for a few days.  It kinds feels like he is rushed from launchie to commander within a week. No wonder people hate him. I kinda did too. He was cold and calculating which is only a small part of the Ender int he book. I wish they could have brought out the other parts of him.
The kids were way too old. Weren't they supposed to be 6?

So much more detail and strategy was expressed in the book I was shocked when the final game was played and then he graduated.  The book is a richer story.",1398816000,,458,4.352941176470588

One of my biggest pet peeves is movie studios who produce one movie out of a trilogy, and because it doesn't do as well at the box office as they would like, then they drop the ball and don't finish the trilogy, etc.  I wish they wouldn't even start and make one movie unless they are willing to commit to however many books are in the series!

The graphic are beautifully done and I was happily surprised by the quality of the acting in the movie.

I would have loved to have seen more scenes described in the book, especially more battles in battle school and in the simulator room, but I am happy with they gave us. Great Job!",1398643200,,616,4.176470588235294

It has an impressive cast and they do an outstanding job keeping you involved.  The story is wonderful and very thought provoking.  I think that this movie has been extremely underrated and sadly gone under the radar of most people.

The story line, the plot, the characters, etc. were all boring, slow developing, and I couldn't connect with any of them.

Overall, the movie was slow, uninteresting, boring, the story line was disconnected and made no sense, and just when it felt like the movie was (sort of) beginning, it ended.  I simply can't recommend this movie and feel giving it 1 star is being generous.",1398470400,,539,4.469387755102041

I hear that they 'played down' some of the more serious realizations of Ender sacrificing/killing people through his actions that was found in the book, but I think the movie didn't suffer too much for it.
 My favorite scene was when the Dragon team challenged two other teams, and how Ender developed a strategy to win (again, sacrificing some people, but at that point, it was still just a ""game"").",1398470400,,630,4.625

5517983,2,B00AW9MB4W,"I can't give it 1 star, simply because it looks like at least a modicum of effort was put into the design of the film, unlike most young adult book-to-film adaptations nowadays. However you could not lose the point or feel of the book more than this film does. They soften Ender's violent tendencies at every opportunity, in an ill-advised attempt to make him more sympathetic. Ender's violent outbursts are crucial to the story, and neutering him is detrimental. The changes to the finally are also perplexing in how they miss the point of the book and Ender's motivations. Just a waste. Not to mention the film is incredibly dull. Even if you're a fan of the book (or perhaps especially?) you can skip this one.",1398470400,,713,4.666666666666667

5517988,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Ender's Game was technically very nicely produced and the actors did a credible job. The story lacked a clear cut motivation for the initial attack on earth by the Formics. Later in the movie it became clear that they needed to colonize other planets in order to survive but there wasn't enough interaction between the races. It seemed more like a video game than a movie.

Also, we began watching the movie on the 1st night but due to factors beyond our control we had to stop watching after about 1/3rd of the movie. When we returned to watching the 2nd day, the movie abruptly cut out after about half an hour so we missed the last 20 minutes or so of viewing. It is doubtful if we rent another movie under these circumstances. There should be more time available to watch a rented movie.",1398297600,,791,4.455172413793103

But I felt like they missed such an important monologue at the end (the bug queen's forgiveness speech).  It was such an important part of the book, I thought, and would have been easy to add to the movie.  It is the part of the book that gives some closure and meaning.

5517996,1,B00AW9MB4W,"This is the best example of WHAT NOT TO DO here is a short list of what is wrong:
1. Peter (Ender's brother) looks nervous in the movie, in the book he was cool and calculating.
2. Peter is supposed to be what Ender fears to become, in the movie Peter just seems like he needs a good spanking. If they would have added the part when Peter dissects a squirrel in the forest and uses twigs to pin the squirrel to the ground, I would have though Peter was a freak the move makes him seem like a joke.
3. Orson Scott Card was notorious for being strict on adaptations. He refused TWO scripts a while back because they A. Made Ender older, and B. Because they added a love story. This movie does both Ender is supposed to be 9 and by making the only sub character who gets character development in the movie Petra it gives off a love story. And this isn't just my opinion when I saw the movie a person I was with called Petra ""the person Ender clearly liked"".
4. BEAN IS INSIGINIFCANT.
5. Petra is the only on with a story.
6. The enemy's gate is only down once in the entire movie (really important in the book).
7. Halfway through the movie I started hating Ender.
8. It seems like Ender is only at the space base for a month, the director said he did that because changing actors would be unsettling to the audience, I guess he never saw the movie.
9. No character gets developed and the plot only gets half developed.

It goes on and on how much junk is in the movie, 3 good things came out of the movie the visuals in the mind game, zero gravity training area, and the command station at the end of the movie.",1398124800,7,1609,4.140575079872204

This movie is like Starship Troopers except with headline actors who actually think they are making a good movie.  The whole point of Ender's ""gift"" was that he was so empathetic that he could understand the enemy and defeat them.  But he never understood the enemy but still defeated them.  In the end, he feels sorry and wishes he could help...blah, blah, blah.  Adversarial movies are only great when the opponent is truly daunting, mysterious, powerful and cunning.

This movie has the same name. The time line has been drastically shortened, the characters are never really developed and the viewer really has no idea what has gone on with Ender. Tons, if not just about all of the meat, have been left out of the story.

Visually, the movies provides a few standard ""aw, isn't that cool"" effects but never touches any of import they might have.

If you liked ""Ender's Game"" the novel, I feel you will be quite disappointed with the movie. If you have never read the novel and see the movie, you will have missed out on the actual content of ""Ender's Game"".

However, at just six minutes shy of two hours, this travesty is somewhat entertaining and has a fair amount of visual eye candy. It's just not Ender's Game.",1397952000,2,1006,4.541436464088398

He is pushed beyond his physical and mental limits to the point of complete exhaustion.  I always envisioned an 8 y/o boy with a thousand yard stare, haggard, shaking and despondent.  Instead, we have a movie about a teenager who has a bad month at Space Camp!  Peter is a only a mean older brother.  ""The Ansible"" is just a name for an object like ""anvil"".  The video game with the giant  is just that, a video game.  This list of disappointments is far from complete, but the greatest disappointment was already established before the first digital image was saved.  The book was about Ender.  The movie was just as much about Harrison Ford.
  I hope that the next attempt to capture this complex novel on film is more representative of the book.  If it is not, I fear that we can anticipate a series of epic failures that we saw with ""Dune"".  Perhaps a mini series like ""The Stand"" would be more appropriate.",1397865600,4,1042,4.502673796791444

5518218,2,B00AW9MB4W,"The main villain doesn't appear until the last 5 minutes of the film, post battle, so nobody is in jeopardy. The villain is supposed to power the story so no villain, no engine, no world-saving work for the hero to do. No one subjecting innocent people to bad things, no threat, no one to worry about, no scary character to impress or frighten the audience.

The story then is Ender's schooling. He's a sympathetic enough character relentlessly bullied as he is, but he doesn't really do much: with no villain he has nothing to do beyond competently dispatching his bullies. While a challenge for Ender, his bullies aren't exactly a world threat and so can't replace the missing primary villain and the work the villain does in the story.

The training game the film focuses on doesn't seem that difficult to me, and when Ender actually organizes the attack at the story's conclusion, he's just directing other characters, sort of like old Star Trek episodes where Captain Kirk tells Mr. Sulu or Scotty what to do.

Acting was solid, Harrison Ford sold Ender as ""the one"" but story itself didn't show him to be the one; it was more the characters kept agreeing that Ender was the one, but with no villain, the story itself had no way to prove to the audience that Ender is the hero.

Casting was overly traditional, wished they'd have cast Ender as female or a minority or the Harrison Ford character as a minority or female. As shot, we have same old, same old: caucasian male power players surrounded by female and minority secondary characters, even down to the african american bark-is-worse-than-his-bite sergeant. Maybe Hollywood will be this way until females and minorities can green light a film, though you'd think that could happen by now.

Also, the storytellers didn't create a believable world. Having the Harrison Ford character just show up at Ender's family home and inform Ender's parents that he was taking Ender did not work for me. Such behavior definitely needed to be supported/explained in the story as in the real world such behavior by a government official would not be acceptable. Writer needed to show a world where such governmental over-reaching is prevalent, the norm: this is really important (otherwise the audience stays outside the story as the story world has no correlation to the audience's world) and needed to be set up in the story before Ender was taken.

The story didn't show the devastation of the attacks on Earth: Ender's family home and neighborhood looked fine.

And the way the other kids bully Ender does not suggest that Earth is under threat.  If Earth was at the point of being destroyed, would the bullying behavior we witness Ender endure at nearly every level of his education be as prevalent? Don't think so. Kids would know there'd be no time for such nonsense, they'd be too terrified.  Writer figured a way to make Ender sympathetic by having him victimized, but the excessive bullying isn't believable in a world where people supposedly live in real fear of alien attack. In other words, teenagers living on a planet that was actually being attacked by aliens would not act as the bullies did towards Ender. If the writer wanted us to buy their behavior, he needed to do alot more work giving us the reason for it. Jealousy and competition, the reasons the writer give here to explain the bullying, don't work when a species is under attack and facing destruction. A planet where millions and millions have been killed, as the voiceover says here, is a world in chaos and disrepair. Such excessive bullying for the reasons given just don't mesh with what's supposed to be happening in the story.

A kid fending off multiple bullies is a sympathetic character and a good start, but with no villain, and a poorly set up and executed story reality, the movie fails to emotionally engage us except that we feel sorry for Ender, but our pity does not a story make. Competent acting. 2 and 1/2 stars.",1397260800,2,3957,4.771929824561403

5518265,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Ender's Game is a classic example of the surgery that must be undertaken to transform a novel to the screen. This film focuses on only one story line: Ender's training at Battle School. He, along with other gifted children, must face tactical, strategic, intellectual, and moral challenges to determine which of them is the one person capable of defeating the insect like aliens who nearly wiped out mankind fifty years earlier and who appear now to be massing for a counterstrike. The novel interwove that thread with the story of Ender's beloved sister and psychotic brother, who scheme to influence and manipulate the politics of Earth. That subplot and a good portion of the mind game/dream sequences have been excised to focus on the combat training, while still emphasizing the moral ambiguity of the whole exercise. The film's success or failure rests almost entirely on the shoulders of the actor portraying Ender, and Asa Butterfield is more than up to the task. He completely captures Ender's combination of steely resolve, colossal intellect, sudden violence, and, above all, the empathy that conflicts with his other qualities. He easily holds his own in scenes with Ben Kingsley (looking like he wandered in from an audition for Queequeg in Moby Dick) and Harrison Ford, suitably weary and gruff (his character's name is 'Graff' in case anyone in the audience doesn't get it). The other young actors are just as good, with the exception of poor Moises Arias, who is given the thankless task of playing Ender's rival Bonzo as if he wandered in from a Bowery Boys movie. His lip curling, eye-popping menace is laughable, particularly since he looks about three feet tall. The special effects are outstanding and the driving score by Steve Jablonsky complements the action very well. Be aware that the ending is slightly different from the book in order to bring closure for those not familiar with the series. Even if you don't like science fiction, the novel is worth a look.",1397088000,,1987,4.96996996996997

Movies like this keep all Americans believing that we can still keep building for a better tomorrow. Is it propaganda?

However I bought the book after seeing the movie and heartily recommend others to do so as well.,1396569600,,410,4.0

5518427,5,B00AW9MB4W,Ender's Game is such an epic book with so many intricate details that it's impossible to replicate without the move being 18 hours long. That being said I loved it and thought it was an excellent adaptation.  I thought it really captured the essence of the book without deviating very far from it.,1396569600,,297,4.60377358490566
5518428,2,B00AW9MB4W,"I had just finished listening to Ender's Game on a book on CD. It was a great book and I couldn't wait to see the movie. However, the movie left much to be desired. In the book, Ender was so young when he started and very isolated. That was a huge part of the story in the way he was used. And while I get the concept of leaving certain situations out for the sake of time, I really felt this was edited poorly for the movie. I felt very little for Ender on a whole in the movie; there was no connection with him. This could have been a really good movie, especially in this day of reckoning for bullying. Instead it was just a so so science fiction flick.",1396569600,,656,4.015267175572519
5518429,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Enders Game had the potential to be great but missed for a numbers of reasons.  One failing is that the characters of Alai, Bean, and Petra are almost one dimensional despite there being so much more detail in Cards books.  There is no feeling that Bean was actually Enders fall back if he had chosen not to return.
I have no real issue with minimizing the brutality of older brother Peter since that contributes little to furthering the plot.  (He was essentially a sociopath in the books.)
Time constraints should never dominate a movie as it obviously did here.  An additional fifteen or twenty minutes would have done so much to elevate this movie.  Besides leaving the supporting student cast in the dust there really should have been one more battle sequence with Dragon Squadron.  They essentially leapt from last place to first based on one victory.  There was no explanation as to how they got to the middle ranking, it just happened.  It is probably too much to ask for to hope there is a battle training scene somewhere on the cutting room floor.  The strategy used by Ender and Bean are both important.  There is no indication as to why Ender should leave the mopping up details to Bean and there is a reason.
Finally, there was no reason to completely ignore the effects of relativistic flight.  Mazer was called an old man, there was one mention of an ansible without explanation.  This effectively closed the door on future movies in the series.  Mazer was almost the same physical age as during the Formic war.  Ender will become the Speaker for the Dead because he spends so much time not aging through his travels.  Why slam the door before the movie was released?
A minor point about the commentary...commentary is most effective when you can listen to it and the movie at the same time.  Not here.
Enders Game is the one Sci Fi book I have read six or so times.  I have read the entire series at least twice straight through.  The movie is fine, but could and should have been great.  As with many movies it is difficult to pick up detail on a TV screen.  Apparently no designers ever consider that dark colors wash out detail on a smaller screen.  At least the sound was not overpowering so you could get all the audible detail.",1396483200,,2249,4.55860349127182
5518430,2,B00AW9MB4W,"The title I wrote pretty much sums up this entire movie. But if you need more details, here goes.

10 years after Will Smith and Randy Quaid  saved the planet from an alien invasion in Independence Day. There has been a fear that the aliens might come back and try again. So now Han Solo is spying on kids via cameras and has zoned in a kid named Ender who is supposedly really, really smart because he beats video games in ways no one else can. Quite frankly if I could just hook my brain up to a pro action replay, I probably could do that too.

Anyway, Harrison ford takes the kid away just like Anikin Skywalker was taken from his mommy, and this star of the movie with a high level of midi-clorians is taken to a space station to begin battle training. The way the military train you for combat in the future is have you play laser tag in zero gravity! War, it's fantastic!

So the kid clocks a few more video games, gets passed around to a few teams, the editing makes it seem like it's all happening in a matter of days before the main boy does the typical ""I can't handle this"" rubbish that has been done to death in films, only to come back and form his own underdog team... here comes the Mighty Ducks in spaceeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!

The end battle was too predictable, not so much of how things happen, but you knew what the end scenario was going to be before it happened. Then it just ends on a stupid note. I'm off to do more than save the Earth, but the whole universe.... a weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!

It's too rushed. You just don't care about this kid. He goes from cadet school, to space, to being switched around, to being unsure of himself and back to try and save humanity in the blink of an eye. All you get is the feeling that this kid is supposed to be very intelligent, has a violent side when pushed, a possibly sociopath, doesn't like authority and will disobey it, and is in love with one of this team members. Pretty much sounds like the story of D-Generation X! (Ahhh, SUCK IT!) There is too many pointless bully scenes that don't pay off in the end, they are just there to show this kid is unstable and will do anything to win. But I just could not care any less.

Visually the scenes and CGI work well enough... but I couldn't help bu wonder if it was a distraction? All that junk flying around in a zero gravity game of laser tag... was it stuff that was necessary, or just visual distractions to cover the fact that it's a game of kids trying to get from one side of the room to the other with at least one member not being shot? Come again, how does that train you to be a commander? Because Ender's game plan was pretty simple, any old jock could have thought that up.

If you don't go into movies like I do, and you aren't so critical of films, and just want to be mind &^%$#@ by visions of space and 10 foot ant's, then this movie might be worthy of a night in front of the tv with a bag of popcorn.... but if you go in and expect this to be more than a barely half decent flick, one that once you watch, you will never want to see again, then you might wanna avoid it. However, be your own judge... see it if you must. Then you can come back and we can make fun of it together.",1396483200,,3210,4.15780998389694

The primary story line survived the translation well, and the character progression was pretty accurate as well. I think that, it you never read the book, thsis movie might seem a little light in the way of character depth. Ender is almost the entire focus of the movie and what fans of the book saw as a gradual increase in Ender's talents was very jerkily and not so convincingly translated in the movie.

5518476,1,B00AW9MB4W,"Perhaps if I hadn't just finished reading the book prior to seeing this movie, then I might have liked it more. I wanted to read the book prior to seeing the movie, and finished it two days before seeing the movie. I loved the book. I think it is perhaps my favorite book I have ever read. With that being said, I had some major issues with the movie. I felt like they changed far too many things from the book.

For starters, Ender is supposed to be six years old when he enters battle school. That's not a big deal, since it would have been hard to find a six year old who can act, so I understand that. In the start of the movie where Ender gets in a fight at school, they completely change the way the fight unfolded.

Once Ender is on the ship heading to battle school, there are characters who aren't supposed to be there. Bean is supposed to be a couple of years younger than Ender and in a different class, but he's on the ship with Ender in his class.

Moving on to the part of the movie that most bothered me: Bonzo. In the book it is clear that Bonzo is TALLER than Ender. Ender is supposed to only come up to Bonzo's chest, which ads a completely different feeling to their heated relationship. I hated the fact that the actor playing Bonzo was shorter than Ender in the movie. When Ender and Bonzo get in the fight in the bathroom, they changed the way the fight played out, which is fine, but Bonzo was supposed to die. In the movie they have Bonzo hit his head and he is in some sort of a coma/still alive. Ridiculous. Bonzo is supposed to be dead, and Ender most definitely does not go back to earth to stay at Bonzo's bedside like he does in the movie. That right there bugged me more than anything else about the movie.

Later in the movie they have Bernard as one of Ender's subordinates in command school, which doesn't happen in the book. In the book it's all of Ender's friends who wind up being his subordinates in command school during the final battle sequences, and Bernard was never one of Ender's friends.

There are tons of things I could list that they changed, but this will suffice. The movie might be decent for people who didn't read the book. I understand that the story lines in books get changed when they are adapted to the big screen, but usually it's small changes. They made too many drastic changes, not to mention all the little things they changed. It could have been an awesome movie, but they sped through it and didn't let the story develop enough.

I have been happy with other book to movie adaptations, but not this one.",1396310400,7,2570,4.288659793814433
5518477,5,B00AW9MB4W,Great story line in movie even though it did not follow book exactly. Nice special effects in movie. Good acting. Entertaining for adults as well as children especially preteens.,1396310400,,178,5.172413793103448
5518478,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Gavin Hood was an uninspired choice to write the script for Ender's Game and it shows in an uninspired film.  Book to movie translations are always hard.  Do you follow the book slavishly, take only the title and general premise, or try to find a middle ground?  Hood seemed to take the approach of making sure to hit certain key parts of the book regardless of how it fit into the flow of the story being shown on the screen.  Meanwhile, the changes that were made from the book often seemed unnecessary and unfocused.

First, were they trying to keep a secret of the big reveal that happens towards the end of the film.  At times they play to the secret and at other times they give enough information to the audience that it is obvious what is happening.  It would have been acceptable to go one way or another, but Hood can't seem to decide which way to go.  Instead he just muddles along to the big secret that isn't a secret.

Next, the whole film feels rushed.  This either needed to be two films with the cut-off being the end of Battle School/the vacation interlude, or Hood should have ditched all of the family, Peter, and Valentine dynamics.  Have Graff mention why the other siblings weren't taken to provide some background and leave it at that.  Anyways, because things are rushed, there is no sense of the pressure Ender is under, how hard he is being pushed, how alone he is, and the fact he doesn't know he is the chosen one.

A deviation from the book that annoyed me.  Earth was attacked twice in the book which made humanity's reaction more understandable.  Also, the fleet was always described as being prepared to defend against the next attack.  Ender only finds out later that the high command has gambled on attacking the Formic homeworld and colonies.  Also, the second battle that Rackham wins was in space in the outer solar system.  Why they moved it to Earth's atmosphere I don't know.

I could go on, but the main thing is the film is not bad, it just isn't that memorable.  Only a couple of times does the film show what it could have been.",1396310400,,2073,4.462765957446808

5518480,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Quickie Review
Pretty good. I went in with very low expectations and it was better than expected. There were huge, glaring plot holes and problems here and there, but overall a good movie. Once again, however, a director seems incapable of properly showing the passage of time. It seemed like the kid was training for about 2 weeks before he got promoted 3 different times. Then, after what seems like a month, he's a the commander of the entire fleet? Maybe the books did this better, but it didn't seem like much was at stake when the kids are playing training games the whole time. I know, the ending is quite a twist and the main focus is the ""morality of war"" concept, but until then it fell a little flat. Also, we really do not need a FREAKING VOICE OVER to open the movie. This is getting old, it is lazy, and too many movies TELL instead of SHOW. It is especially annoying when they show us the same footage and give us the same explanation in the movie itself FIVE MINUTES after they just did the first giant exposition dump. I had the same problem with ""Oblivion."" Stop it, Hollywood.",1396310400,,1095,4.425742574257426

The special effects are dynamite too.  The story is very well told with a  classic surprise ending.  The movie sans the top notch sound and special effects would probably be a 4.

5518558,4,B00AW9MB4W,I moved between three stars and four. I really liked the book and the film was very faithful to the book but it cut a lot of the drama somehow. I think Harrison Ford was a bit too big of a known character although he was  sympathetic one.,1395964800,,238,3.9583333333333335

Ben Kingsley plays an unbelievable, and not in a good way, Maori related pilot who trains Ender.

Some cons:  The movie seems a bit rushed in places.  It may have been too much subject matter to try and fit into a two- hour movie, but it did try to follow the book very closely. Also, the ending didn't seem to capture the extreme stress, and the sickness that Ender succumbed to in the book as well as the book.  This is important because it is the main driver for Ender to go and seek out the Hive Queen egg.  However, the main point was still there, it just seemed a bit contrived.

I would definitely recommend the movie, there were many times during the movie that I said to myself, ""That is exactly how I imagined that scene.""  This movie will find a place in my library for those snow days that I have nothing else to do.",1395878400,,775,4.154362416107382

What about the older brother who made a 30 second appearance to quickly bully him and was never seen again.  Harrison Ford's character could have been played by any gruff military type.

Since I haven't read the book, I came in with no expectations, except for a good scifi movie. It was good but not great and fairly predictable. Ender was obviously the halfway point between his brother and sister -- a great tactician with empathy for the enemy. There is the obvious underlying theme of using children playing the game of war as a training ground for the real war and was looking toward the day when we would have children, or at least young adults who played video games raining death on our enemies (or suspected enemies of the state) from above. Drones. We have those now, so Orson Scott Card either had a vision of the future or someone took his idea and ran with it.

The special effects were great and the acting pretty one-dimensional for the bad guys and bullies. The rest of the characters were somewhat fleshed out and at least entertaining on some level. The focus was obviously on Ender and the special effects, so the level of acting was good for what they were given. I enjoyed the movie, even without factoring in Harrison Ford, and might watch it again, but I doubt I would go the extra mile to own it. The movie didn't resonate with me.",1395532800,,1205,4.472727272727273

It felt like it progressed through the story extremely fast, where the majority of the book was the slow development of Ender. They introduced some prominent characters (like Bean) almost immediately which I didn't like too much. Also there was very little play between Ender and his siblings, where in the book they played much larger rolls within Ender's thinking himself. Peter was almost non-existent and it seemed like Valentine was there for only moments.

5518808,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I have mixed feelings about the theatrical version of Enders Game.  Although it attempted to stay true to the novel by Orson Scott Card (who was also one of the producers of this movie), I felt that because it left out one of Enders major character development  you didn't get a sense as to the intense transformation he endured at the hands of the Battle School process.  For instance, Ender is much younger in the novel than he is portrayed in the movie.  This made a difference for me because with the novel you saw how the development of a childs brain was being altered so that he could grow to become more than a homicidal killer, but an antisocial leader capable of extreme destruction for the greater good.  That is the major premise of the novel, but the movie missed this mark.

In the novel, you both empathized and feared Enders capability.  In the movie, I mostly just felt sorry for him.  The boys he killed had never been accidental, but in the movie he only killed one boy (by accident) and the other boy, he simply stopped.  Again, the character in the movie looked to be in his early teens.  Ender killed the first boy when he was seven years old; this makes a huge difference in that Enders capacity for violence seemed to be at the hands of the Battle School and not a part of Ender in the movie (which was just not so).

All in all, it was a good movie.  It did what it intended to do, it entertained.  However, if you're going to make a thinking mans Sci-Fi, then commit to it.  Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley are gems in this movie.  The children are not; which is sad since the plotline centers on the development of children into efficient military soldiers.  It could have been so good and instead it became okay.",1395360000,,1739,4.3875

5518810,3,B00AW9MB4W,"If you've never read the books you will find it very hard to understand.  'Ender's Game' is a lot like David Lynch's ""Dune"".  The books are better suited to a mini series than a feature film.  The uninitiated will not be in awe at what they have seen and will not understand any of it.  This is the reason it fared poorly at the box office.

Now to those of us familiar with the books, we know of Ender's relationship with his brother and sister and the fact this is barely touched on in the film is ok as we can mentally fill in those gaps.  The scenes at battle school are pleasing but much too short to convey Ender's skills from the book.

The final conflict with the Formites is much more grandeous than I imagined in my head.  Though reading the book spoiled the ending.  I have heard if there is a sequel they are going to stick with the current cast and take them in a different direction from the next book in the series which has Ender as an adult.  This will probably be a good thing and make the sequel's story surpass that of the original.",1395360000,2,1052,4.189054726368159

This movie was clearly made before Ford was offered the chance to reprise his H. Solo role in whatever Star Wars film is up next. So, he must have been broke and desperate to make a film--any film--when he shot this stinker. I'm certain the parents of the 7th graders who wrote this screenplay are very proud. Clearly, the kids are still enjoying regular naps since they built a nice long one into the last three quarters of this film. Plodding, uninteresting, unstimulating. unimaginative. My advice?

5518875,5,B00AW9MB4W,"As a fan of the book series I was worried that the film adaptation would not work. The film works for me on every level apart from some scenes feeling a bit rushed. It was a pity that Gavin Hood's deleted scenes on the BD version had not been edited into a Director's cut version to show them in context. Asa Butterfield is very believable as Ender Wiggin with Harrison Ford as Graff, in a relationship that is reminiscent of Ford with River Phoenix in Mosquito Coast. The ensemble cast could have been developed more, especially in the character of Bean,( Aramis Knight), who is a key player in the other books of the series. A thought provoking SF experience for my young grandson when he watched it, asking more morality questions than I could give answers. For fans, the extras on the BD give some insights into the complex production problems and casting.
Production:
The set designs & VFX by Ben Proctor, Sean Haworth and Digital Domain are magnificent, some of the best I have seen in SF films and IMHO equal to those in Gravity when projected on a large screen. Steve Jablonsky's score contributes at the emotional level without being overbearing. The space scenes are awe inspiring when shown on a big screen with multi-channel audio setup correctly. I pre-ordered this Reg A version from the UK and was pleasantly surprised to received it the day after the USA release. I also have the UK release and there are a few differences between the Reg A and Reg B versions.
1) The top menu is different  and I prefer this one ( the USA, Reg A version).
2) The 7.1 audio field sounds better on this one. (with a lack in LFE channel on the 5.1 UK, Reg B version.) this may just be a problem with my player though.

My son thought it was a very good representation of the story. A few minor differences but followed the book pretty closely. One main difference is in the age of the main character. In the book he is 6 years old and in the movie, a teenager. After seeing the movie it's understandable why the children were portrayed older. I can't imagine you could find enough six year olds to play those parts correctly. The advertising hype would lead you to believe it is an epic space battle movie but this is not the case. This is a story about psychological mind games and the resultant actions of the players. All in all a very good film!",1395100800,,790,4.203947368421052

5518919,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Enders Game is one of those movies that is going to divide people and that division is going to be primarily based on whether or not you have read the book. People who have not read the book will either like the movie or just think its ok because a lot of the issues I have with the film come from reading the book. If you have read the book you will not be too keen on the film and in some cases hate it. A lot of my issues with the film are issues I have with all film adaptations of books. You cannot have everything from the book in the film and as a result a lot of moments are skipped through that give the story a depth creating a rather shallow film. While that stuff does bothers me it is a necessary annoyance of film adaptations of books or else the film will go on too long and be boring. The main issue I have with the film is that there a couple of characters that aren't represented well, such as Ender and Graff and their relationship, and various points from the book aren't emphasized well enough, such as Enders miserable life, and the ending. While this is isn't the worst adaptation of a book Ive ever seen its not the best either. Issues always come when transitioning books to film so no matter what it will let me down but a couple of changes really got to me and those who read the book. The film is alright but nothing spectacular as a lot of the changes make the film feel shallow and rushed. If you haven't read the book do that is it has a lot more depth.

The actual concept and message behind this movie (and the book it was based on) is pretty compelling, however. The adaptability and malleable nature of youth makes them the perfect officers, conceptually, which is something the story taps into. The misinformation and disinformation utilized to draw specific emotions and actions was pretty brilliant IMO. The greater question of what an enemy really is, whether that enmity should be enduring, and the moral questions surrounding acts of war was something that resonated with me.

5519036,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Watching this film, I couldn't help but draw comparisons to other specific sci-fi on the big screen: Not too long ago the Star Trek reboot showed us Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Uhura together at Star Fleet Academy. And some 15 years ago was the abysmal adaptation of Starship Troopers. I liked Star Trek, despite my annoyance at some aspects of it, but still, Enders Game is, so far, my favorite space cadets-playing-war-games movie.

As far as Heinlein goes, this film captured the spirit of his military science fiction better than the movie that bore the title of his trail-blazing book. Ive never read Orson Scott Card, but am tempted to at least add his books to my bucket list, now.

Card used an interesting premise for this storyline: Future armed forces will train children for war, since youngsters adapt quicker to new/changing technology. Hence the hero is a child, with the responsibility of Earths very existence resting on his bony pre-adolescent shoulders.

Or is he a hero? It wouldnt surprise me if the critics hate this movie because of what survives to the big screen from Cards book: the suggestion that ruthlessness is required to win wars. That is watered-down considerably by writing the character as a bleeding heart type with an emotional maturity more on par with an aged monkwho just happens to be a savant with military tactics and strategy.

The acting is fair, on averagenothing spectacular. The boy playing Ender is called upon to be misty-eyed in too many close-ups to remember, and he delivers. And Harrison Ford hams it up (this is a consistent phenomenon in his recent roles, seems to me) as Enders stage mom commander. Other actors are believable enough. (In Fords defense, the role did strike me as written with a lack of dimension.)

What made the experience enjoyable for me was the character interaction written into the academy scenes. Group dynamics can be fascinating from an anthropological perspective (or depressing and infuriating from a participatory one). Reduce the group members in age to when the passion and motives of human beings are easily observed, and the intensity amplifies accordingly. For this reason I should have loved Lord of the Flies, but they lost me at fade in.

I can nit-pick pretty much any movie to death (even those I like), and have. This one is no exception. But Ill just mention one thing that bothered me: the mixing of naval and land force ranks in one branch of service. Having sergeants, colonels and admirals all in the same branch is justwrong.

But anyway, I found that the good outweighed the bad and Enders Game is worth a watch.

I am even fine with the absence of Peter and Valentine from the story. For the most part the scenes in the movie come from the book. These scenes tell the story of a child being groomed for battle  just as it is states in the book.

My issue is that , at least for me, this is not what the book was about at all. The movie completely skips the most important parts of the book IMO and tries to condense Enders feelings into a couple of blurbs by a child psychologist. I feel the entire point of the book was missed in the movie.

Anytime a movie revolves around using children (without) special abilities to be the new ultimate soldiers, I just kind of cringe, then when they manifest the idea into a three hour saga about their feelings, I just want to puke.

The only thing I really found myself bothered by was Kingsley's role, I don't know where they got the whole facial tattoo thing from, I found it rather distracting. Harrison Ford was fantastic and really made the role of Col. Graff come alive. Asa Butterfield made the perfect Ender in the book we got to follow Ender from a younger age, but I understand why they needed to do it this way with casting. Great story and great movie. If you've never read the book I won't spoil the ending for you, but it was handled well. Ignore the controversy surrounding the author, it's completely irrelevant. So the guy believes in the traditional marriage model and doesn't want to see that changed, so what? Like you're not allowed to have a different opinion than the mainstream anymore and if you do you'll get ostracized for it. Doesn't make him evil and it sure doesn't change the fact that this is an awesome book and an awesome movie. If you think you're making a political statement by not watching this movie because he doesn't support gay marriage, guess what, you're not. Calling for a boycott of this movie because of the book author's politics is silly.

5519121,4,B00AW9MB4W,"""Ender's game"" by Orson Scott Card was first published in 1977 as a short story. The author expanded it to a full length novel by the same name published in 1985 which is regarded by many people including myself as one of the greatest SF novels ever written. Some elements of the film are also taken from Card's parallel novel, ""Ender's Shadow.""

This review of the 2013 film version, which has just come out on blu-ray and DVD, is based on watching it at home on disc with my family.

I don't think the film is quite up to the level of brilliance of the books. Some of the most visionary aspects of the novel, such as the way it foresaw the role of online debate and discussion at a time when the World Wide Web was a twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee's eye, do not make it into the film. A viewer who has not read the book would have no conception that the hero's brother and sister, who are major characters in the book and its' sequels but minor ones in the film, are as influential in their own right in the history of the ""Enderverse"" as he is.

Nevertheless this film is a pretty good stab at bringing to the screen the central plot of the original short story and many of the moral dilemmas and challenges of the full novels - and I don't think you could have fitted much more of the books into a film of this duration. The plotting is reasonably tight and keeps the action going, much of the acting is excellent, and the special effects which show space travel, a ""battle school"" on a giant orbiting space station, and finally space battles, are brilliant.

The premise for the story is that Earth has been at war for decades with an alien race who originally attempted to invade our planet and were beaten back at great cost. The insectlike alien enemy are usually referred to in the film and in some of the more recent books in the series as ""Formics"" - in the original book they were usually referred to as ""bugs"" or by a similar and even ruder word. Presumably the more polite term has been adopted to reduce charges of xenophobia. In fact neither the books nor the film are at all xenophobic, but some of the characters in them are: one of the moral issues the story addresses is whether fear and hatred are the only possible response to the enemy and whether mankind might be too quick to assume that the extermination of one or other race are the only possible outcomes.

The human race has decided, for reasons which will become clear, that to win the war it is necessary to start training the best potential commanders to lead Earth's military while they are still children. The story is set at ""Battle School"" and then ""Command School"" where the children with the highest military command potential are being trained to lead the fleets.

Harrison Ford plays Colonel Graff, the commander of Battle School, whose job is to pick the boys and girls who will lead Earth's forces to victory or defeat. Graff is determined to develop the best and most ruthless commanders no matter how much pressure he puts these children under: Voila Davis plays Major Gwen Anderson, Battle School's psychologist who is horrified by how far Graff is prepared to go.

Asa Butterfield plays Ender Wiggin, the boy who Graff is trying to turn into a new Caesar or Napoleon - and who is sharp enough to respond, when Graf shares that aim with him, that Caesar was assassinated by his own people and Napoleon was defeated. Ben Kingsley plays the older Mazer Rackam who becomes Ender's final teacher (the younger Rackham who defeated the original Formic attack is portrayed by Kyle Clements).

Aramis Knight plays Bean, Ender's lieutenant and the closest thing he has to a friend, who is the viewpoint character of the book ""Ender's Shadow.""

I though the acting by Butterfield, Ford, Davis and Kingsley was superb - Butterfield and Ford were both nominated for acting awards for their performances in this film.

I'm trying to think of a way to give this film a fair rating without damning it with faint praise. I did enjoy it - my 12 year old son thought it was brilliant and is desperately hoping there will be a sequel.

That may be difficult this time around - not least because the other books in the series would be even harder to film than ""Ender's Game"" which the author and others have been trying to turn into a film for a long time.

I don't believe this will be the last film version of ""Ender's Game"" that I shall see. Gavin Hood and his colleagues have shown that it is possible to produce an entertaining film version of this book. Sooner or later, and probably within my lifetime,  another director and studio will be unable to resist the challenge to see if they can produce a brilliant one.",1394668800,,4692,4.499412455934195

It was like watching your best friend flail helplessly as he sinks beneath the surface of the water, and you can't swim.

5519217,4,B00AW9MB4W,"The Ender franchise has turned into such a global phenomena that now, most kids are required to read it in High School. I was one of those kids and I absolutely loved the story. In fact I continued on with the books and they became unbearably strange. How they got almost 20 novels out of it is beyond me. While I was really excited to finally see Ender's Game on the big screen, I knew the chances of it continuing past one film would be slim at best. It all has to do with the ending, which is bizarre and really shouldn't have been continued. For those who don't know the story, in the future, Earth is at war with an alien species known as the Formics. The Humans have taken heavy losses and in desperation have started a recruitment program, that focuses on children. Knowing that kids think in a different way than adults do, they are hoping to find that one genius who has the key to defeating the Formics. That child turns out to be Ender Wiggin, a child who under Earth's new Government, shouldn't have even been born. Seeing the story I read so many years ago, come to life on the big screen, was magical for me. Finally I was able to understand the parts that were just too confusing to see in my head and get the complete picture. Ender is played by Asa Butterfield, who somewhat miraculously, at the age of 15, has had the starring role in every film he's been in. After watching Ender's game it's not hard to see why, he was to this film, what Ender was to the Human's in the story. The producers surrounded him and his young crew with a cast of Academy Award winners including Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, and Viola Davis, which ultimately strengthen the movie and must of really inspired this kid to give the performance he gave. While the film simply broken even at the box office, (killing any chance of a franchise developing out of it) it was very well done and closely mirrored the book. They did a near perfect job of deciding what parts should stay and what should be eliminated, giving us a film that was just as good as the book, if not better.",1394496000,,2069,4.348837209302325

There is some truth in the concept that kids are more proficient at gaming technology than adults and applying that premise to real life military situations is plausible. That said it isn't very believable  the way 14 year old  Ender rises above bullying and other childhood obstacles and rockets through the ranks to become a great military leader against earths greatest enemy which threatens humanities extinction. If you get past the ridiculousness of all that it is entertaining. Sort of a remake of the Star Troopers movies idea us against the bugs.

The movie did a good job of getting the book's long complex storyline into a 2 hour visual story. I am glad the movie's ending was the Ender character I heard. It would have been a lie if Ender was not mortified by the lie of the ""game"" - tricked he ""___ Spoiler ___"" not a simulation of it.

5519235,4,B00AW9MB4W,"This is a thinking person's Sci-Fi. In fact, it would barely qualify as a Sci-FI because the futuristic science is not one of the central theme of this movie.

Exciting this movie really isn't. If you are looking for a Sci-Fi action flick, then you might be disappointed.

This movie is about leadership. How does one become a leader? How does someone build trust and win the hearts and minds of his/her team? This movie provides rather insightful answers to these questions.

In my view, everyone should be interested in learning to be a leader. Being a leader doesn't necessarily mean being a formal leader. It means having the qualities of a leader so that can build trust and gain influence of others around him/her. It is one of the life's great survival skills.

What I didn't like about this film is the notion that teenagers can be more competent leaders and battlefield strategies than experienced adults. Really? If teenagers are so competent, how come our society is not led by teenagers? The movie definitely downgrades experiences and wisdom of adults as something irrelevant. Now that's fantasy.

Pros:
1)Great book on how to develop one's leadership skills. Provides good case study on what a great strategic leader would do in challenging situations.
2)Provides deep insights into human relationships and even has a moral dilemma which gives the audience something to ponder.

Cons:
1)Not an action flick or even an exciting film.
2)Barely qualifies as Sci-Fi.
3)Adults are portrayed as incompetent compared to crafty teenagers. Will our civilization really succumb to relying on hormone raged teenagers to save the humanity? I think not.",1394409600,,1654,5.0625

As for the movie, I did not get to see it in the theatres so I'm viewing it for the first time and I think this is going to be a movie that I will have to view a few times to fully appreciate it as a science fiction film.

5519263,3,B00AW9MB4W,"I have been a fan of Orson Scott Card's Ender series (especially the first two: Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead) that I found the movie enjoyable but too short.

The game room in the book developed so much about the story line that was left out of the movie.  My guess is that they had a lot more game room scenes that didn't make the cut and I look forward to an extended version with those restored.  Who is Bean?  Why did the commander when castigating Ender say he was micromanaging Bean and should let him do what he did best, innovate?  All of this was explained in the book and most of it was based on early experiences in the game room.  Another key element, the mind game, was explored just enough make it relevant and I commend the director for reducing the time it took to bring that important plot twist in without wasting too much precious screen time on it.

I still believe that with the addition of one training session in the battle room where Bean shined with innovation (the string maneuver etc.) and two battle before the big final battle would have added a lot of character development opportunities that are missing from the movie.  I rarely believe that a movie can cover the depth available to good authors.  A good director just doesn't always have the time to fill in many of the details (Peter's and Valentine's influence, the overall political situation on Earth, etc.) but to leave out the pertinent character developments that were vital to understanding the space battles was, in my opinion, a major flaw in the movie.

Having that background knowledge I could still sit back and enjoy the movie which has wonderful special effects, excellent acting, and I thought Asa Butterfield played a nearly flawless Ender from my recollections of the book.  If you truly want to enjoy this movie and understand some of the subtle elements I highly recommend reading the book.  If you've watched it, read the book anyway.  Fortunately the movie did not totally change the story so the book will fill in gaps rather than modify the storyline.",1394409600,,2067,4.63013698630137

While the initial view of the battle room was interesting, the nature of the game, and of Ender's mastery of it was short and superficial. Thought the relationship between Peter, Valentine and Andrew was portrayed poorly, and that Ender's emotional development was trite and cliche. While not a great fan of Orson Scott Card, I thought the original novel captured much of the emotional journey in Ender's coming of age, and his eventual emergence as a soldier trying to come to terms with the nature of genocide and his personal responsibility.

Unfortunately, there's either not enough budget or time to show Ender growing up in Battle School so a lot of the character development is lost in Alai and Bean, and the side story of Valentine and Peter is mostly lost.

My biggest complaint is the casting of Bonzo as half Ender's size instead of tall and aristocratic.  He comes off as a nasty dwarf instead of a proud and fearful wannbe leader.

That said, the graphics are marvelous, the story is told, and Ben Kingsley is a wonderful Mazer Rackham.",1394323200,,608,4.5

But - there is sooooo much that is skipped/condensed/collapsed that the movie does not make sense unless you have read the book(s) already.  The books focus on the characters and interactions much more - as well as Enders' internal thoughts.

You just don't get that in the movie.  Wife and kiddos loved it - ecstatic about it - because they read the book.

I thought it was ""OK"" - then after reading the book, I agree it would have been great...

5519400,4,B00AW9MB4W,"It seems to me that many films start off very promising, transition to a certain momentum and then, alas, stumble across the finish line in a disappointing fashion.  This film is just the opposite.  Full disclosure up front.  I wasn't, and am still not familiar with the source material but I suspect it is pretty well written.  I should also disclose that I'm a  sci-fi fan and have been since I first saw a movie with a genetically altered giant ant (""Them"").

This story is about Earth barely surviving an alien assault from another planet by a species called Formics.  They appear to be giant ant-like (see!) creatures looking to colonize our planet.  After an all-out war, the Formics were eventually defeated with much of the glory going to a pilot known as Mazer Rackham (a tatted up Ben Kingsley).  Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) heads up a unit responsible for finding what is left of the Formics on their home planet and annihilating them with a preemptive strike.  The key to success appears to be young pubescent teens who are gifted intellectually but also don't have their brains cluttered with life experiences like the adults.  Hey, that makes some sense to me in a future world.

Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) has been identified as the primary candidate to lead the assault.  In essence he would be the battlefield commander.  This middle section of the film is where the story falls flat.  First, Master Butterfield wasn't very convincing as the guy who would stand up to bullies in the various training sessions.  Physically he isn't very imposing.  One of Ender's primary allies and potential romantic interest is Petra (Hailee Stenfeld) who suits the role.  Director and screenwriter Gavin Hood muddles this part of the story but saves it with some terrific CGI battles (simulated) in preparation for the final attack.  Without giving too much away, the adults are still running the show.

The film's nice premise focuses on idea of using children in a war time setting.  The film's conclusion raises other moral issues which for me, turned on a light as to what the film was actually about.  Recommended.

The Blu ray version of the film comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The film has a lot of CGI in place and the green screen shots that go with it.  In general, most of the movie is shot indoors or in space so the natural look of the film is somewhat dark.  Fortunately the black levels are excellent.  Some of the color designs in the film seem problematic but that isn't the fault of the transfer technicians, so no complaints on the video.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track and it is very, very good.  I was particularly impressed with the surround sound distribution.  It is evident that the technicians paid attention to this element and it shows.  Never offensive but relevant to the various scenes.  Excellent dynamic range which again is often lacking.  Subtitles include Spanish and English SDH.  Extras are the usual:  a couple audio commentaries, a making-of featurette, some deleted and extended scenes, a short piece on how scenes were shot and a trailer.",1394236800,3,3142,4.809345794392524

(I read the first four books in the series, the first two of which were outstanding, the next two pretty good but not enough for me to continue with the series as Card wrote more.) Watching this movie, most of the details came back, and I found that the visuals of the movie felt true to what I'd pictured when reading. It was very enjoyable to see these wonderful scenes come to life, and it's great that modern special effects have a reached the point where this is possible.

There were a few aspects that could have been improved. The Battle School training sequences were good but lacked the thrill that the book evoked. Ender's relationships with his siblings was underdeveloped in the film. But overall I felt the story was well told, well acted, and never boring.

It's a shame that Card's personal beliefs affected the reception of this film. I didn't know about them until the movie came out, and part of why I didn't know is because the story is not about his personal bigotry. For myself, I've chosen to approach the story entirely on its own merits, not to pass judgment on anyone who made it. Others may make a different choice.

There is a telegraphed twist near the end, followed by an absymal conclusion.  Why do aliens, who always have superior technology, always have to be large insects?

5519409,5,B00AW9MB4W,"Rarely does a book translate accurately to a film.  Although not perfect, this was a fairly good representation. I was especially impressed that the movie downplayed the language/graphic violence in the book, yet conveyed the point of the violence from Ender's perspective. In some places it was very necessary to the plot.  I wouldn't let my children read Ender's Game yet, but I did let them watch this movie. (my oldest is 9yrs).
Of course, the book spends a significant amount of time with Ender building his army at Battle School, and in the movie the zero-g scenes are very few (a little disappointing) - but I can't imagine how difficult those scenes were to shoot, and the ones they did show where impressive.

This film has a cast that is full of Oscar caliber talent including, Sir Ben Kingsly, Viola Davis and Haley Steinfeld. Still, who engulfs you in this film is Ender himself, Asa Butterfield. Every emotion he lets out the audience felt. There were moments that made fans cheer and moments that made them tear. The story of a boy that will be used as a weapon to save mankind is a fantastic and sometimes heartbreaking story. The cast and story are what truly drives this film a long with a great score by Steven Jablonsky. While it may not be entirely accurate to the pages of the book, the film is its own animal and gives the watcher an incredible experience.

There actually could have been a better overall effect with more of an emphasis on the mental state of the children. If it was even entertained, I understand why the production team kept it ""safe"" for all ages but it ignores how much ""darkness"" youth actually seek in storytelling. Walking on the fringes of what they're being asked to do comes off as awkward. A lot of people said they were trying to cram too much in but it seemed like there wasn't enough. Simple narratives from time to time could have shrunk the universe to better understanding.

5519546,2,B00AW9MB4W,"1985 was a good year --- not only was I born but this was the publishing year of what many call the original YA dystopia. Ender's Game as a film had a lot of work to do from the outset. It not only had to overcome years of developmental hell but had to contend with severe controversy surrounding the Orson Scott Card's questionable ideals as well as high expectations from the series' legion of die-hard fans. Now, I haven't ever read the books so I had no basis of comparison when going into the film but I did have high hopes. Based on the trailer, the movie looked awesome! Unfortunately, for me, Ender's Game did not defy the odds.

The story follows Ender Wiggin, a newly recruited member of a battle school designed to train young children to fight a war against the alien forces that attacked Earth years prior. Ender finds himself alienated and must overcome incredible pressure from everyone, and most of all, from himself, in order to lead the team to victory.

I can't really say if the plot remains faithful to Card's original novel, but I did enjoy the idea of it. For the time it was written, it was probably uniquely original, but being late to the game, I can't say I haven't already seen it all before. Despite the predictability of the storyline, my biggest gripe was that it felt like key elements were missing --- not plot holes exactly, just like critical scenes had been cut at the last minute, like there were gaps in important information. Instead, it relies heavily on these grand info dumps from Wiggin via the narration and the character development and storyline suffer because of this. Another big problem I had was with the story's overall cohesiveness, in that there is none. The whole movie feels as though it takes place in the matter of a week and because of this, there's very little depth. I lost track of time watching it, probably because I was doing other things other than watching it. In short, I just didn't care.

You would think that the star-studded cast (Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, Hailee Steinfeld, Viola Davis & Abigail Breslin) would be enough to save this drowning movie, but alas, such was not the case. Breslin has but a minor role and Davis, arguably the best in her role, isn't featured nearly enough to leave a lasting impression. Ford and Kingsley deliver passable performances, but they hardly shine. And newcomer Asa Butterfield is wooden and stiff in his role as Ender. I don't know if the character in the book is this way, but he's incredibly unrelatable in the film. Things come to him far too easily and I had no idea why he was appointed to be the leader of the group. Nothing he said or did really gave me a good feeling about him. Honestly, I didn't care about a single one of the characters and if you don't care then what's the point?

I guess the look and feel of the film were about the only things I think the filmmakers got right. The set and cinematography were spot-on, everything I imagined from the spacey, sci-fi setting. I want to play in that Battle Room. So. Freaking. Amazing. But other than that, Ender's Game was an utter fail as a stand alone movie. If it's done anything positive, it's only made me want to read the book that much more.

Food for Thought: All in all, I was less than impressed with Ender's Game. Though it was a visually stunning movie, I found it to be predictable, full of wooden performances and too hard to comprehend. Since I haven't read the book version, I have no basis of comparison so I'll let the rest of you be the judge of that one. Overall, it was a majour letdown for me.",1394064000,,3591,4.501533742331288

5519550,3,B00AW9MB4W,"This was a pretty good movie,probably steered toward younger people that are game addicted and or  like annimation. Sorry to sound old here but the draw here for me was Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley,being they were important to me with Star Wars,Blade Runner and Ghandi(Ghandi being not an action movie but well acted) and others in that era.
  The concept here is that this brainiac kid is plucked out of his class for having razor sharp leadership skills and solutions to problems and advanced to defeat the latest threat to the colonies in from Earth from the ""Buggers"" an Insectoid species going after the ""queen"" bug. Harrison Ford playes a ""drill sargeant"" type to find his next leader because the last ""millitary kickbutt leader""(Ben Kingsley) was thought to be killed in the last big battle to defeat the bugs. It turns out he wasn't killed but went into hiding on a distant location,maybe I'm wrong about the details but you get the concept. The kid goes through ""cosmic boot camp"" and defeats his opponents in a series of trails and winds up in charge of the military forces,and what he thinks is his final trial which is a video game defeats the bugs and gets the queen to save everyone. Actually it is reality and he really does kill the enemy(and a lot of his troops)to gain victory,the command has fooled him into doing the job and he freaks out. Everything works out in the end even though he feals used in the process! He gets the bugs and the pretty girl in the end and becomes the next""millitary kickbutt leader"".
  From what I read in a movie description this was a book from 1977 and I guess finally CGI got advanced enough to do this type of movie. I don't mean to be prejudgiced toward ""gamers"" but the treand toward ""action through CGI sequences"" has become so often because of cheaper production costs in hollywood I miss real acting! Maybe CGI has got to be so good that there is no need for actual acting?Anyway this is aimed toward gamers,its actually a pretty good movie! This reminds me of ""Starship Troopers"" in a way,and in that movie it was the ""brain bug"" that was the thing to get! They plug in a couple of good old actors to make it more respectable and draw in old farts like me!!haha!!check it out,its a good way to kill a couple of hours!!Hey look at last years big space drama ""Gravity"",it was almost all CGI and made a ton of money(no acting awards)but a lot of technical awards and etc. Maybe someday there will all CGI movies and no need for actual actors anymore,like Jim Cameron said in jest on the set of ""avatar"" a few years ago(that movie made a billion),it would sure be a lot cheaper then paying a bunch of high price actors,haha!!just kidding!!who knows what the future will be?The Oscars seem to still favor an actual acting movie! I suppose Sci-Fi will be in this CGI trend?From Star Wars on this is the way its going,watch and enjoy!!This movie is worth 3 maybe 3 1/2 stars at best!",1393977600,,2936,4.52165725047081

Yes, it is odd that the plot line would place teenagers in charge of the salvation of the planet.  Given the choices that some of them make today, that would seem to be a bad move and an open recipe for disaster.  However, this younger generation is quite good at multitasking of the sort required in the movie, even if some of them seem to pile bad decision upon bad decision - note Justin Bieber.  Yet, one could not escape the open presentation of youthful conflict - the joy of winning a competition, the hormonal competition with their peers, the need for approval, and, in the end, the desire that Ender had to carry the final enemy queen to a new planet, which is what the enemy desired to start with.  A adult commander would not have made this decision.

5519741,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Turning books into movies must be difficult. Change too much and you are at risk of angering the fans and change too little and the movie might not flow that well. Ender's Game leans somewhere towards the latter of that spectrum, but it still works fairly well as a film in its own right. Despite not liking some aspects of the book, the Battle School section is fantastic, so I had high hopes for this film. Luckily, I wasn't too disappointed.

The movie does a good job of explaining the story quickly to newcomers without boring readers. Basically, aliens called Formics have attacked Earth twice, and the last time humanity almost lost except for Mazer Rackham's heroic (and mysterious) sacrifice. Now, the Formics are attacking again and the government is training children to take them down, with the war relying on training a particular boy named Ender Wiggin to be the leader.

Ender's Game the book travels at a fairly quick pace; Ender's Game the movie speeds by even faster, which is both a good and bad thing. The pacing feels perfect in the last half-hour or so, but during the Battle School part (as I mentioned as my favorite part of the book) feels like it is missing some crucial scenes. When (mild spoilers) Ender gets control of his own army at the school, he says he will make them the best. And then all of the sudden we cut to just one battle and one battle only that results in Ender leaving to go to Command School. The book perfectly captured the feeling that Ender was rising to the top, but somehow the movie mostly misses this.

Although I would have liked to have seen more, the Battle Room scenes are neat (basically zero-gravity laser tag) and the movie strengthens again near the end where a twist that will likely surprise those who haven't read the book is executed perfectly. The ending is thought-provoking and handled very well, perhaps even better than the book did it. All of the acting performances are great, with Asa Butterfield as Ender being a particularly strong choice. The music is also very impressive, and visually the film looks great.

Outside of a few small but glaring problems with the film's pace and a few pieces feeling like they are missing, this film is what any fan could have hoped for from the book and stands on its own as a good science-fiction adventure. Those into the genre should definitely check it out.",1393718400,,2372,4.640476190476191

Disclaimer: I love SCI FI in books and on screen. I'm a Star Trek Classic fan through all the movies. B5 fan.
For person 1)  Read the book and watches the movie.
You will be disappointed. They did not treat the subtle scenes of the training in orbit well. They didn't have time. Mericans don't like long movies. I would like them to reshoot the film with the entire book in the movie.
They were not able to include the nightmares when they were at the forward base doing the simulations. They had to introduce those nightmares as a couple of statements.
The nuances, and subtle nature of the book was not treated well in the movie.
However, the movies was excellent.

For person 2) Never read the book, likes science fiction movies.
You'll like it. The cut scenes are excellent. The pace is fast.

No sex !  WOW a successful movie without sultry scenes. Maybe Hollywood can learn something from this movie.

Really a wonderful read, and I heartily recommend it. In fact, if you can, read the book before seeing the movie, because while the book didn't spoil the movie, the movie will possibly spoil the book.

Anyway, acting, special effects, casting were all very good, and having read the book (although many years ago), the movie made sense to me. Usually I leave sci-fi films asking lots of confused questions:  ""Who was the guy with 5 arms?""  ""Why did the shiny guy eat the monster thing instead of throw it back into the pit of whatever?""  But Ender's Game the book was so good that it explains all the questions so Ender's Game the movie makes complete sense.",1393718400,,796,4.358108108108108

5519772,1,B00AW9MB4W,"I read the book in 1985 and then again in 2013. It had won all the major SCi-Fi awards. Hollywood changed many aspects of the book including the fact that the bugs attacked Earth twice and slaughtered over 100million people. Also, Hollywood decided to make the military the bad guys. Yes, in the book, Ender felt some remorse, but he succeded in saving Earth by destroying the 90% of the evil queens and saving the egg of the benevolent queen. Quite a bit more that Hollywood changed to further their own agenda. People that see the movie but  don't read the book , will have a completely different perception....the Hollywood idealogy instead.",1393632000,3,644,4.75
5519773,3,B00AW9MB4W,I guess I should have expected it but... kiddy time.  Harrison Ford can't really save this one from the surrounding cast.  Not a terrible movie but certainly lacks real substance.,1393632000,,179,4.933333333333334
5519774,2,B00AW9MB4W,"This movie is poorly written and poorly directed, both by Gavin Hood.  Characters routinely announce their motivations, the same bit of exposition is repeated no less than three times in the first 20 minutes of the movie (the repetition is a minor plot point later on, but it's a completely unnecessary one), and we get lingering shots of scenery without any real point while the rest of the movie feels like it's rushing to get through major plot points as fast as it can.  Harrison Ford looks and sounds tired, but I don't think that's a character choice.  The second half of the movie is much, much better than the first, but that's just because the first half is laughably bad.  And half of the good half is just a setup for the sequel they were surely hoping to make.

I thought I'd be happy enough with this movie if they just had some cool scenes of space paintball like in the book.  Turns out there's not much of that here, and what is here sometimes abandons the ""Ender is a tactical genius"" aspect that is the core of the book for a more conventional ""Look at how well he can shoot with a gun in each hand!"" approach.  They do have one good battle school scene that feels like it could have come straight from the book, but those 5 minutes don't make up for what comes before them.

I don't want to come across as one of those ""They ruined my favorite book!"" types.  I don't actually care if they change the book, as long as the changes make a good movie.  I think some of the changes here would have worked better if they had gone further with them.  Ender's siblings, for instance, get such little screen time and characterization that the movie would have been better off cutting them completely; as it is, they're just a way to visualize a ham-handed theme.

All in all, I only really enjoyed about 20 minutes of this movie.  The rest just felt like it was keeping me from the fun parts.",1393632000,2,1902,4.369318181818182
5519775,3,B00AW9MB4W,"The cast is incredible.  Even the kids cast are very good actors.  The special effects are excellent.  But make no mistake: this is a kids movie with a predictable and semi-boring plot.

To avoid spoilers, let me just say that the first alien invasion mentioned in this film was turned back in such a simple and silly way that it makes the plot of Independence Day look like it was co-written by Einstein and Asimov.  And the rest of the film sort of follows suit.  Ender is chosen for qualities that most of the kids in every middle school across this great nation already exhibit.  He is not special.  The training sequences are kind of interesting at times, boring at others.

As a kids movie, this is a great choice!  Very well-done.  For adults who have already encountered better, more complex and interesting science fiction plots, this movie is NOT recommended.",1393632000,,869,4.688741721854305

These don't translate easily to the screen.  Those who've read the book will find the movie somewhat perfunctory, and the story won't be convincing to those who haven't read it - because much of Ender's difficult journey is just given sound bites here.  For example, Ender's return to earth to visit his sister just takes a few minutes on screen, whereas it's a real re-connection and recharging that takes much longer in the book.  But again, the dialogue and scene had to be compressed.

Where are the adult scifi...with adults in them?

Perhaps this works in the book. I didn't read it. But the kid who saves the world just doesn't do it for me to be honest. It just seems adolescent in a movie. Again, it may work in the novel....but not in the movie.

The movie itself was well done and the story flows well. It was well written and the cinematography was great as well as direction. My only beef was that the stars were kids....kids that seemed to be like 15 years old.

If I were a teen I would enjoy it. But as a grown up who sees the level of maturity in today's teens it just doesn't work.",1393545600,,851,4.2024539877300615
5519814,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Read the book 25 years ago. totally forgot what happened. I was expecting a space action flick, but it was more cerebral, exploring Ender's outlook on life and what it means to be a pawn in a game you don't understand.",1393545600,,218,4.341463414634147
5519815,3,B00AW9MB4W,They should have made it into 2 separate movies. One focusing on Battle school. The other on Command School. This would have helped the movie immensely and made it more understandable.,1393545600,,184,4.967741935483871
5519816,1,B00AW9MB4W,"I read the book a long time ago. Then I read it again - by mistake. I do that occasionally when I have forgotten that I have already read it. That's not a good sign. If you get half way through a book before it all seems familiar that's a sign that the story isn't very memorable.

The book is very famous. It is by far the most famous book written by Orson Scott Card. It spawned a number of sequels. Everyone one with any interest in Science Fiction has heard of 'Ender's Game'. But watching the movie version after all these years it seems trite. That's because it has already inspired a number of movies including ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Matrix"".

It is very reminiscent of the Matrix. Harrison Ford keeps saying over and over - ""He's the One"". I wanted to say in refutation - ""No, he isn't dummy, Keanu Reeves is the One"".  The idea that little kids make good fighters was just exploited in last year's ""Hunger Games"". And the military training meme was also seen recently in ""Starship Troopers"".  So the whole story setup is anything but fresh.

The special effects are of course perfect. When the space ship took off I reminisced about how that same scene was done in ""Fire Maidens of Outer Space"".  In that super cheesy 50's movie they cut in some stock footage of a V-2 rocket going up. When it returned to Earth they showed the same rocket with the film inverted. Even as a tiny rug rat I knew this was all wrong. Movies should be better than that.

In ""Ender's Game"" the CGI special effects are damn near perfect. So it was surprising that about an hour into the film when I was overtaken by a wave of boredom. If I hadn't paid five dollars to see it in high definition I would have switched to something else. It just wasn't a strong enough story to sustain my interest. I didn't believe in the characters. I didn't believe in the situation. And what's worse, I didn't care.

The real point of the plot is not about training little kids to be soldiers but about the morality of genocide. Personally this theme lays an egg. Who cares about these aliens? Kill 'em all seems OK to me. But Card tries to elicit an emotional response by having the old switcheroo in the final reel. The nasty aliens who we thought had tried to kill us were really sweet, sensitive bugs who just wanted to communicate. Ender feels real bad that he killed all of them.

When I read the book, this emotional climax left me cold. When I saw this scene played out on the screen last night it also left me cold. It was too flat. We had never seen the alien bugs except in a few heavily excerpted flashbacks. We never saw them in person - just their space ships. We were never given any reason to love them or hate them - so who cares if they have been wiped out?

We need some new plots. We need more Sci-Fi movies that endorse alien species genocide like ""Starship Troopers"". Most Sci-Fi movies recently have endorsed genocide of humans (e.g. Avatar). Here in California we could use a little genocide of the Delta Smelt - but we have been fed all this tripe about the horrors of species elimination and we have lost our  own will to survive.",1393545600,4,3131,4.353344768439108

5519874,5,B00AW9MB4W,"I admit it -- it's been a while since I've read any of the ""Ender"" books but from what I remember, it matched as well as can be expected for an adaptation of  a book.  Considering that the author was one of the producers of the movie, I guess it was close enough to satisfy him as well.

There was a big push for the special effects but for me, the important part of the movie was the boy, Ender, and how he reacted to the ""set-ups"" he received -- either directly or indirectly -- from Colonel Graff.  I don't normally see Harrison Ford in an unsympathetic role but he played this one to the hilt and was very believable.  You almost hated what he was putting the boy through but yet you understood (or thought you did) why.

Ender's reaction to the final battle were just as I expected.  Many have mentioned that they did not like the ending.  I did.  It showed a ""humanity"" in Ender far beyond what his teachers expected.

I did note that under ""special features"" in the description is the designation of ""None"".  That is not true.  There are deleted and expanded scenes include.  I have not yet viewed them.  I just finished the movie itself about an hour ago.",1393459200,2,1163,4.324074074074074

I thought the actor who played Ender really captured the essence of Orson Scott Card's hero.  Hurt but only when necessary, a smart strategist, but not a killer -- as they wanted him to be -- but a compassionate soldier.  He kept his compassion to himself.  Even when confronted at all odds, he didn't back down but tried to figure it all out.

The family thing was skipped entirely from the book.  His brother and sister had a blog and was very political in nature and this was cut out.  Also his brother was not well developed at all.  I had no care for the movie version.  The sister, she was a bit better developed but I didn't care there either.

As in the book, the film version of the ending was great.  I won't spoil it, but when I first read this ending I was amazed.  No way did I guess that.

The end of the film hints at a sequel, most likely Speaker for the Dead or some such.

Overall, recommended.  Harrison Ford as the crusty old general is unintentionally hilarious.

I found myself asking questions, like why do you have to have permission to have a third child, and I wanted to know more about why the other two siblings were dismissed (the older brother was implied to almost be chosen but they vaguely hint that violence was the reason he wasn't). I am sure that reading the book would clear this all up, but honestly I tried to read a few pages and the author has a writing style that I do not care for and sci-fi books are not my thing. One of the few genres that I want to see created since my imagination has a hard time creating what the dome they trained in looked like (as an example).

Great science fiction asks the same kinds of questons that science asks about the nature of our universe and then offers up plausible maybe even fantastic answers but always rooted in real science.

While falling short of my definiton of great science fiction, Ender's Game touches on many moral and ethical issues of life in general and concerning the morality of war and how it it is waged in particular. The acting and character development are well excuted, and production values are first rate.  Thankfully, Ender's Game isn't the simple minded kind of hostile alien movie that Independence Day or Battleship were.

First thing - it's based on the book but is not the book.  The 2-2.5 hour limit of a movie prohibits making a paragraph by paragraph recitation of the book.  HBO could do it perhaps, but not a movie.  Books turned in to movies always have this issue so if you expect the book on screen you will miss the movie.

Second thing - it is not and never was a young adult, action-adventure, coming of age story in the fashion of Hunger Games.

What is going on here are some deep and uncomfortable questions about belief and morality. Parents, schools, society and governments have always believed it is appropriate to mold children in a fashion beneficial to the collective whole. Even if it turns the child in to a useful monster?  Even if it merely leads the child into a adulthood he/she would otherwise reject?  Is it OK if survival of a society, nation of even the entire species is at stake?  If it is acceptable under the most extreme circumstances, what about when your total and sincere belief as to the actuality of said extreme circumstance is false?  Was it still OK because you genuinely believed?

What about genocide? Is there any circumstance the justifies it?  What if the alternative is the certain extinction of your own culture or nation or species?  And again what if your true and genuine belief is false?  (The book was published thirty years ago when the Holocaust was much more in the memory of many still living.)

What about a game or hyper-realistic simulation vs reality?  Do you make different choices depending on which one you face?  Should you?  What does it do to you when you think your actions don't count?

Both the book and the movie are deeper than they first appear.  The more you can suspend disbelief and see yourself in the role of either the children or the adults the grimmer this tale becomes.",1393372800,,1866,4.580060422960725

I have not read the novel by Orson Scott Card and prior to watching the movie was not familiar with the storyline.  In my opinion the move felt disjointed or disconnected and I think more time spent transitioning between major sections of the storyline would have been beneficial.  While the movie will probably be very entertaining to kids/teenagers (who may or may not have been the target audience), as an adult I thought there were too many holes in the plot to fully enjoy the story.

Orson Scott Card's novel is a highly-regarded work of science fiction, and like so many other movies made from classic novels, I think this film does not do the novel justice.",1393372800,,759,4.684210526315789

The character ""Bean"" is also barely there, in fact after his brief introduction I lost track of which actor played him.

5519945,3,B00AW9MB4W,"The book was remarkable in the evolution it portrayed.  The idea that someone could be identified so young and then trained to be truly extraordinary in the hands of a committed and sometimes ruthless mentor -- all for the sake of saving the planet.  Card tripped over so many interesting themes, so many insights, many of which popped out accidentally if you read his own forward --  that would never translate to the screen.

This ""adaptation"" turns the well known story into a visual adventure.  While it is a great story for those who have never experienced the book, it ends up being EXTREMELY CLICHE when you pull the depth out.  it is simply the story of finding the young boy who turns out to be savior.  A very common and overwrought theme.

My main criticism is that they could have done more with the battle room, the intricacies of what was learned there and how would have been fun to watch.  It was the battle room and the slow and painful lessons he learned that made Ender - Ender.  He was not great day one, he was not a leader all the time.  It took a lot of bruises to be someone who learned to win, not just because he wanted to or because of luck.

Same thing with the glossing over his study of the bugs formations.  It was not just - ""oh i noticed""... Unfortunately, something that could have been as powerfully moving for its lessons -- think ""pay it forward"" - ends up just another cool looking movie.",1393372800,,1426,4.396946564885496

Sadly, so much is left out from the book there is very little left but a basic premise. I do not know if it was to much story for a single movie, and if that was the case they should have made it in two parts. Do battle school as volume one and command school as volume two. So much of the character development and the strategies were left out that it makes it almost impossible to understanding Ender and the other characters.  You get little snippets but nothing in depth, so when it all comes to an end it is very unsatisfying.

But the way it was done on screen, they should have made it more obvious what was going on. I thought to myself that non-readers would be confused here, and my assumption was confirmed by some people I've heard from who hadn't read the series.

5519991,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I love Sci-Fi movies and books and so you know I just had to see this one.  This book is a classic of science fiction that any one that is a Sci-Fi fan has read and enjoyed.

Earth is in trouble!  The Formics showed up with their advanced technology and almost defeat mankind before we were able to turn the tables and win.  Only the heroic efforts of Mazer Rackham saves mankind in a turn of the battle.  The leaders of Earth know the truth.  They almost lost and by a fluke of battle won, almost by accident.  They know the Formics will return and they know that they need a new generation of military minds to win the next time or to be defeated.

Ender Wiggin is the boy born and bred to be the one to save all of Earth and mankind.  He has to be trained, nurtured and put into the right position to manage the war.  Is he the hero that everyone thinks he can be?

This is a good film and the special effects are just outstanding.  The use of key leading actors in the filming made the movie even better.  Harrison Ford played a great role in the film and I liked how he and Ben Kingsley added real grit (Albeit much shortened time period) to the training of Ender Wiggins.  I have to say though that the book was better than the movie. Isn't this usually the case though?  The story deviates from the book in several areas and I believe it was done to make the movie more enjoyable for the people that have never read the story.  Unfortunately if you had read the book you loved the story and the details of how Ender was hammered into being the leader needed to fight the war is a major part of the written book.

The movie was good and I give it a 4 star rating.  I am also glad how the CGI was great but it didn't just take over the film and destroy the story totally.  Some of the last movies I have watched were just so much CGI action that the story suffered by being overwhelmed by the CGI artists.  If you are a lover of the book you will have to see the movie.  It is fun to see it come alive on the screen.  Just be prepared to see some changes in the overall presentation.",1393286400,4,2088,4.0661764705882355

Naturally, due to the nature of the beast, the film version cannot be truly faithful to the printed word, however the film stays loyal to the main story tbemes and the scenes with the most impact are the ones that are included in the film.
I loved the visual interpretation of the school battle room. It's much as I envisioned it from the book. The interaction between Ender and his classmates was portrayed somewhat accurately but more emphasis could have been placed on the sense of isolation Ender feels from the rest of his class.
As others have stated, the ending could have played a bit longer and explained a bit more as Ender goes from being battle commander to Speaker for the Dead.

Overall, I was not horribly disappointed, and can completely understand many of the changes that were made.

My only real complaint was Bean's character. I haven't read the books in a while, so i grant i may be recalling wrong, but he was a great deal more cunning in the books.

5520124,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Whenever a film discussion turns to the idea of adaptations, one of the first questions that inevitably comes up is, ""how does it stack up to the original novel/video game/cartoon/comic book/etc. that it's based on?"" It seems the very notion of rating the film on its own merits goes right out the window.

The argument isn't without merit, but I've always felt hesitant to go down that path. Too many die-hard fans and purists have the mentality that anything changed from the original work is a mistake, possibly even a travesty. Many seem to forget that we're talking about adaptations, not translations. Look up the definition of adaptation, and you realize the intent to change things from the original is built right into the premise.

Of course the flip side is you can only go so far before it ceases to be an adaptation and becomes an original work in its own right. While most of the source material is subject to interpretation, adaptation, or even downright deletion, the core that made the original story worthwhile is key to having a successful adaptation.

So to that I ask, was Enders Game successful at adapting to the big screen while staying true to the core that made the original novel such an engaging read? The answer is a hesitant yes.

For those unfamiliar with book or movie, the story follows young Ender Wiggin in a future where humans were once nearly exterminated by a race of mysterious aliens. Now, children with superior minds and the ability to think outside the box in ways unknown before are recruited and trained at the Battle School to potentially become the next hero of the human race in a second alien war that hasn't even come yet. Ender is one such child, tactically and strategically brilliant, even compared to his Battle School peers.

On a technical standpoint, the film was more than competent. The visual effects were top notch, and art design was exceptional. Virtually all physical elements of the film were pictured exactly as imagined from the original book, a claim I can only make about one other film (Lord of the Rings). Perhaps the only let down was the camera work. With any film where scenes take place in zero-gravity, I feel there is an opportunity for some non-conventional camera work, which the cinematographer here just didn't take advantage of. Instead, what we get is acceptable, but nothing to write home about.

As far as plot goes, as a standalone piece it holds together relatively well. There are no glaring plot holes, the pace moves briskly when it has to while giving scenes a chance to breath when emotions are running high. The only real issue I would point out with the plot is that Ender's time in training is (understandably) accelerated, to the point that it seems he moves through Battle School too quick to really have learned anything at all.

As an adaptation, it hits the key plot points, all the major characters are there in more or less the same archetypal roles as in the book, and anyone who's experienced both would be hard pressed to point out any key points of action missing. The only real drawback is again Ender's time at the battle school; in the book, he's there for a significantly longer time, and is given a chance to really develop and grow as a soldier and then as a commander. This is the one point where I feel the story would have been better served as a mini-series, where more time could have been given to Ender's growth, both professionally and emotionally.

And that's the real crux of the matter with Ender's Game. Anyone who's read the book knows that, for the most part, the characters surrounding Ender are essentially archetypes, barely more than cardboard cut outs, that are never really developed. The same could be said of the film, which is unfortunate when you have co-starring talent the likes of Ben Kingsley, Harrison Ford, Hailee Steinfeld, and Abigail Breslin.

Following Ender's development, on the other hand, is largely what I felt made the book such a wonderful read. We're right there in his head when he hits all the extremes of pride, anger, loneliness, depression, self-contempt and so on. Much of this gets at least touched on in the movie, but the emotional impact just isn't there, and not for lack of skill from the star, Asa Butterfield. The problem comes from the expediency of story that your typical film requires. They just didn't allow the time for the buildup of emotion, or give the characters a chance to develop in a way that necessitated what emotion we did see. Again, this is where a longer format, such as a mini-series, would have benefited the adaptation greatly.

I'll forego a lengthy discussion on what other issues I had with the film, as they're more directly a comparison of the movie to the book. For example, there's a sub-plot involving Ender's siblings which was completely stripped from the story, and while it was certainly interesting, it didn't directly serve Ender's story and I can understand why it was left out. Also missing is hearing Ender's thoughts as he evaluates the tactics and strategies that he sees from his peers. Again, this is something that I found incredibly interesting, but like the sub-plot around his siblings, you won't miss it if you haven't read the book. The one thing I'll point out is that understanding how he views the tactical situations around himself is largely what gives the reader a sense of what makes Ender special, and so it is sorely missed from the movie for those that have read the original story.

In short, the story was good, the acting ranged from competent to well done, and it was enjoyable overall. The story was simply to rushed to deliver on much of the emotional impact it needed.

5520128,3,B00AW9MB4W,"Let's begin by saying that the book was fantastic. As with most movies base on novels, the movie does not doing it justice. Not that it wasn't a good attempt, but it seemed rushed and more condensed than it should have been. It moves so quickly that when a character leaves or is eliminated, it really doesn't matter. You did not know them long enough to feel bad that they left.

Even with Ender, there wasn't enough time to show the Ender in the book. If I had watched the movie first, I probably would have said ""Yeah, so, who cares."" By itself, the movie doesn't make it. Not at all. You must have knowledge of the book to follow this but even then, it comes more as a disappointment rather than something that will make you rejoice.

It could have been 2 movies. Slow it down, give us time to get to know and like the characters, the struggles they go through, etc. Let us see their turmoil. Someone said that a movie is different than a novel. That is true but in a story like this one, a little more care could have been taken to preserve the spirit of story. It was lacking.

I was very excited for the film.  Sadly, the film makers decided to make the movie too short.  The novel itself isn't a long book, but there is a lot of things packed into it.  The movie clocked in at 1:45 by time the credits rolled.  15 added minutes would have easily fleshed out the snippets.  The scenes didn't feel like scenes, they felt like snippets.  Only 2 of the battles in the battle room were in the film, which is ridiculous and none of the free time training sessions that helped Ender gain the respect of his fellow battle school comrades.  The movie barely even scratches the psyche surface of Ender, which is the whole point of the book (along with the 'Mind Game' game), the weight of the world on an adolescent.

The film makers wanted the movie to stick close to the book, but sadly because of the running time, this movie is nothing more than a shallow film when it could've been something ala Moon, Children of Men, Gravity, etc. that delved into the psyche of it's characters and resonated with the film watcher the way the book did.",1393113600,,1227,4.417777777777777

I was tossing near the end as to whether the training was continuing or it was a real mission.  Guessed the latter because it was near the end of the movie.

Many elements of the book were included but without the depth of detail that the book has. This created a lot of gaps and the story seems to move too quickly. A lot of the emotional moments in the film don't have their basis firmly planted in the film's story, which makes them unbelievable.. If they had gutted absolutely everything that was not essential to the goal of the film, it would have come out a more cohesive story.

Or with a series of films, one could get into each the story arcs that were brought up and do them justice. Again, producing a more cohesive story.",1393113600,,693,4.40625

There is a good bit of good psychology in it.  It's a lot about motivations, critical thinking and the importance of aggression as being a last resort rather than a first line of defense. I can see why they used children however I don't think that was right. I don't want to give away the movie so I won't say anything more about the story line. Of course Harrison Ford is always excellent, so is Ben Kingsley. The ending primes it for a sequel.

Every single person I've spoken with about the film (who HAS read the novel) said this movie was terrible, and a disservice to Orson Scott Card. I couldn't agree more.

The film was very monotonous. The child actors are sub-par. There was hardly any character development. The audience is left feeling detached, not relating/sympathizing/empathizing with any of the characters.

This movie could have been an epic. It would have been better as a three-part series, so that the story could have been addressed in its entirety. I HIGHLY recommend reading the book first, and then never seeing this movie.",1393027200,6,761,4.9375

I am always a bit wary when one of my favorite books is turned into a movie. Oftentimes the translation from print to visual performance does not work.  I am happy to say that the movie adaptation of Orson Scott Card's classic exceeded my expectations. I think the main reason is that the adult supporting cast: Harrison Ford, Sir Ben Kingsley, and Viola Davis gave such strong performances.

I also agreed with the idea of casting older children to play the parts of Ender and his compatriots.  In the book, by the time they reached Command School, they were teenagers, so to have them be so in a two-hour compression was not jarring.  This is different from the approach taken by the Harry Potter series where Harry and his friends grew up with each film.  That choice was really not available in this case.

The sets, the music, and the technical aspects were appropriate to the story line and did not distract.",1393027200,,958,4.633136094674557

The most memorable scene for me was the exchange between Ford and Butterfield following the final battle. Ford was captivating. Just great acting. The special effects are also first rate, lending believability to the story. The story itself is well conceived....that humanity would, in times of desperation, break through any taboo to survive. A movie about consequences and morality. Very enjoyable. I wish more movies had this level of complexity instead of just being black and white, good and bad, as most movies are.

You really got a sense of what he was going through.  The other characters were also done well.

5520267,1,B00AW9MB4W,"Ridiculous. I can understand the dislike by most people who have read the book. I simply cant fathom why they padded all the hard corners of the original story in this ridiculous movie. The impending destruction of the human race was part of the storyline in both the book and movie, right? Ender was supposed to learn how to lead soldiers and destroy the Formics, right? Why did the movie remove one of the major themes of the book? In the book Ender held no advantages except his mind. His youth, size, and the concerted effort of the adults to see that hed never have anything easy was a major part of the storyline. Ender was supposed to become harder, pushed to the breaking point and beyond by his human enemies, except this movie made all his enemies powder puffs. How does that not make this movie ridiculous? The Formic War won by Shirley Temple on the Good Ship Lollipop. Granted, the book was about making children the most dangerous of killers. Perhaps an uncomfortable theme, but The Hunger Games managed to pull it off without sanitizing the gladiatorial horror. I rented this movie to see the adaptation. If youve never read the book, well, find something better unless you're easily amused.

Keep in mind, yes there were some important elements that were left out and I did have to explain a couple of things to my husband and daughter since they were not explained well in the movie - i.e. what the significance of a third child means and why it's important.

However, if they were to put all of the elements in the movie, it would either be over 4 hours long, or made into 2 movies. It could not be done. I would have preferred to see more with the battle room and how Ender formulated his strategies. But again, there is just not enough time to put everything into a 2 hour movie.

With that said, I think they did a great job with the major points to the story. Some will disagree, especially with the sub plot of Valentine and the older brother (I can't remember the name at the moment), but again, not everything will fit into a 2 hour movie. The special effects were very well done and I did like how they portrayed the battle room. It was way better than I imagined it!! So was the final battle in command school. I thought the effects were great and I liked Harrison Ford as Graff.

I thought it was well done and I would recommend it to others. I would also consider purchasing the movie.",1392854400,,1363,4.234615384615385
5520442,4,B00AW9MB4W,"Excellent special effects that reproduced the physical environment described in novel.  screenplay consistent with storyline of book.
Would see again when it becomes free on Prime.",1392854400,,180,5.923076923076923
5520443,1,B00AW9MB4W,Badly done.  I loved the book.  My husband hadn't read the book.  Neither of us liked the movie.  It raced through the plot - seeming to pick up on the useless details while leaving out the things that made the book great.,1392854400,6,222,4.214285714285714
5520444,1,B00AW9MB4W,"I read the book in College. It was a good story. It did not translate to the Movie.
Regardless of the differences between book and movie, I simply did not get the sense that Ender was a leader.",1392854400,6,193,4.105263157894737
5520445,5,B00AW9MB4W,I thought it was a movie with a lot action and with a story to tell..  it ended with hope for man kind.,1392854400,,103,3.4782608695652173
5520476,3,B00AW9MB4W,"I would not recommend the movie.  I expected so much more.  When the movie ended I was thinking, really?  I don't normally bother with writing a review, especially a negative review.  I like Harrison Ford, I like technology, I enjoy the fantastic, I like a good story.  This movie lacked on all counts.  If you go ahead and watch the movie at least you can compare your review to this one.",1392854400,,389,4.408450704225352
5520477,2,B00AW9MB4W,"I read the book years ago, long enough that I remembered the basic premise, but not the details.  Enough to make me intersted in the film.

I found the movie to be shallow and almost boring.  I did not come to like or empathize with Ender at all.  The plot/story seemed rush and vague and predictable (even if you hadn't read the book years ago.)

Big disappointment.",1392854400,,367,4.417910447761194

5520479,4,B00AW9MB4W,Apparently this movie is a little different from the book. But I really enjoyed it. I hadn't read the book but still kinda predicted that the final test wasn't a test. It kept my attention.,1392854400,,189,4.428571428571429
5520480,4,B00AW9MB4W,"I thought the acting, plot, and visuals were amazing. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I thought the ending was cheesy and kind of a cop out. I would have preferred a harder ending were characters are forced to live with consequences, not simply have an easy solution.",1392854400,,288,4.452830188679245
5520481,4,B00AW9MB4W,I liked it. I think it was hard for them to get the book into a movie so they skipped some things. But overall I was happy.,1392854400,,123,3.5925925925925926

5520483,1,B00AW9MB4W,This movie is awful! As a fan of the story I was extremely disappointed! Left out so much of the heart if the story.,1392854400,,116,3.875
5520484,3,B00AW9MB4W,"This movie seemed to be an outline of the book.  I read this book many years ago and my two teenage boys have also read it.  We were very excited when the movie finally came out, but by the time we were able to go to the theater, it was already gone.
So we waited for it to come out on Amazon Prime and sat down and watched it together.
We were disapointed that the flight school was really rushed, since that was a favorite part of the book for all of us.
""Enemy's gate is down"" was one of the main parts of the book, and really glossed over in the movie.  The flight school ""room"" was really amazing!! We all agreed it looked different that we imagined, but that it was really great in the movie!

It was enjoyable and fun to see it on the screen.  My boys (big fans of Star Wars and Indiana Jones) were happy to see Harrison Ford in the movie.  It is worth a watch if you've read the book.  I have no idea how this movie would seem to someone that didn't read the books.
The movie left itself open for a sequal, but I'm not sure more money would be invested in this.",1392854400,,1069,3.9906103286384975
