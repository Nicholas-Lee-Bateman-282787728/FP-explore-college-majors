8274798,5,B0019N6UHY,OMfreakinG!!! This is the greatest offer in the history of offers!!!  If you do not order this then your collection is not complete!!  Everyone else is going to have these three great classics...  except you!?!  Meet the Spartans is worth half the price by itself!!!  Miss it and you might as well be a third-worlder!!!!,1307145600,2,320,4.745454545454545
8274799,1,B0019N6UHY,"Why on god's green earth is this a bundle and why is it so expensive?  The Simpsons Movie is $18, Me Myself and Irene is $11 and Meet the Spartans is $16; that adds up to $45, you can buy 300: the complete experience for the difference.",1295913600,,236,4.0212765957446805
8274800,1,B0019N6UHY,Why in the world is this so expensive?  It divides out to over $35.00 per movie!  You can get them much cheaper by buying separately.  DO NOT BUY!,1244678400,3,146,4.142857142857143
