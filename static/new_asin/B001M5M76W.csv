4999684,1,B001M5M76W,"The only reason I gave this lousy movie one star is because I had to in order to publicly post my review.  The acting, filming and storyline are absolutely horrible!  I just wasted valuable time watching this movie because I wanted to know how it ended.  This movie does in NO way properly represent what a typical Muslim family is like if anything it distorts it, why not travel to anyone of the 1.6 billion Muslim people in the world and produce a positive, worthwhile movie instead.  There is enough negative images of Islam throughout the world, how about something positive for once!  While it is true that female genital mutilation occurs in parts of the Arab/Muslim world, it is important to note that it ALSO occurs in several other cultures and religions as well, so stop singling out Islam!!!",1444348800,9,802,4.7

4999686,4,B001M5M76W,"A brutal film that shows the treatment of females in the Muslim world, the USA with thousands of refugees that has received and now more thousands coming do not have any laws to protect girls from female circumcision, forced marriage and Honor killing.
Spain checks any child taken to their Muslims countries for a visit and if they come back mutilated, both parents serve jail time and after are deported without any female child.
Muslims give more value to a camel than a female.
The USA needs to pass laws to protect women, and stop the use of Sharia Law in the USA by Muslim lawyers for family issues because are on favor of men and some States are allowing..
I am very surprised this film was allowed in the USA, where we have a lot of censorship .
Thanks Amazon for showing it.",1441843200,3,783,4.444444444444445

Several times, I thought about turning it off as some parts were just downright difficult to watch and I had to close my eyes or just turn away.  This movie is for mature audiences only and I am giving it five stars--as difficult a story as it was to watch, the story needs to be  told and the acting was excellent.  No I do not love this movie-but for the above reasons only I give it five stars---could never watch it again....hope I can sleep tonight.",1439510400,4,525,4.326530612244898
4999691,1,B001M5M76W,"What a garbage movie did I watch. Varun Khanna or whoever wrote or made this movie seems they are completely ignorant about Islam. The values depicted in this movie are completely opposite and against what Islam teaches. You need educate well yourself about a religion before making such a NONSENSE movie. Don't confuse culture, ignorant practices with a religion. Like in India, does Hinduism really teach child marriages or keeping pure virginity? Again, this movie is full of absurd, nonsense and fake characters and completely biased targeting a religion unfairly. Please read Holy Quran accurate translation and judge this movie yourself !",1501027200,,644,5.323529411764706

4999695,1,B001M5M76W,"Besides the bad acting and the sick to the stomach weak childish story this movie is full of intentional lies about Muslims and the Muslim values. This movie depicted the Muslim father who spoke Egyptian colloquial as a monster who despised America and the american values didn't hesitate a second to mutilate the genitals of his daughter who happened to sleep with a ""white boy""!!!!!!! The poor girl said it in the end of the movie ""my father made two mistakes first he came to this country"" that tells you the real intentions and goals behind making a movie like that..delivering implicit vicious messages to the viewers subconsiouns to hate Muslims.
 not only it  Intentionally portrayed a sick and false picture of the family values inside the Muslim family it also ignored how those values assimilate in and share a lot of the American values.  Stay a way from this biased sick one sided propaganda garbage.",1497571200,3,912,4.833333333333333

Pathetic father and son-regardless of their ""beliefs"" there is no excuse for the way in which it depicted his daughter being treated that way. Surprised by the end, her suicide?

4999723,1,B001M5M76W,"As soon as I saw the goat slaughtering scene in the beginning, I immediately knew it was about bashing Muslims. The filmmakers have made a poor attempt to portray the Muslim family as dis-functional and perverted. As a Muslim woman I honestly didn't know whether to get angry or to laugh after viewing this movie. It is so ridiculously far from the truth. Incest? Female genital mutilation? Really??? These are not only non-Islamic they are inhumane. No where in the Koran is female genital mutilation mentioned. Even the prayers they scripted in were all backwards. If you are going to bash Muslims at least do your homework and put a little effort into it! True Muslim families have love and respect for one another just like any other family. Of course there are some backward people who may still live in stone age, but this is due to their culture and has nothing to do with religion. Viewers please don't be misled and manipulated by this distorted movie. Let's all keep an open mind and live in peace.",1450569600,22,1008,4.668539325842697
4999724,5,B001M5M76W,"Beyond Honor is an emotionally moving depiction inside a devout Muslim father's family -- a glimpse into a family dynamic that most Westerners will never see. The acting is almost not a distraction, but considering the horrors going on I thought that many characters would be absolutely hysterical. And this is one of those movies in which sympathetic characters do not act in their best interest. I found myself saying a few times, ""Yes - Call. The. Police!!!""",1449446400,3,461,4.923076923076923

8499841,2,B001M5M76W,"This disgusted me. Then the reviews that critique this as stereotype disgust me, because mutilation and suppression and violence against women and spousal sexual abuse is a reality in cultures that are pervasive in certain areas of the world.  I'm all for social justice and the combating of stereotypes, but in this case the virtue of combating stereotypes would result in ignoring horrific injustices that are 100% real and in fact commonplace practice in areas of the world we prefer to pretend don't exist.  This movie was packaged by Amazon to look kind of sexy, and then it turned out to be a horrific story that no doubt reflects many someones' realities.  While I resent the surprise of disgust when I was expecting something entertaining and wanted to give one star, I am giving two stars for the reminder of this awful reality and the need to advocate for the rights and safety of women in places where it is needed--I will never speak of my disagreement with genital mutilation with a casual or academic tone again, and will certainly, vehemently, seek to persuade instead of opine.

This story could only of been shown as an Independent film.
Most people will think this was about religion but it's not don't be confused by the imagery & discussion of prayers.
The whole issue was about ""Preceived Honor"" & the assumption of being disrespected or loss of honor. The father had little respect for himself & even less repect for his family. all of which washout in the way he treated his son & his wife in word and ""deed"".
As well as in the way he was treated by his sister and aunts.
There are people of all faiths & creeds that are confused by honor & respect, most criminals say they did something because they wee disrespected.
