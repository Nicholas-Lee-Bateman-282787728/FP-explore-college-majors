8325890,3,B000X7SB3I,"Anyone looking for a visually acceptable copy of the movie will find this copy to be one of the better copies available. The film transfer was decent, without a lot of the scratches and blemishes you find in these older movies.

That being said, the soundtrack is simply abysmal. The volume is very low and what sound that is there is not so clear. I plan to use Goldwave and some filters to bring up the volume and try to make it more audible.

Lastly, there is no hint in the ad for the movie that this is a DVD-R. Considering that, I believe the price is too high. I would have scored it 2 1/2 out of 5, or 5 out of 10, is possible. Since that wasn't possible I went with 3 stars because it is better than just 2 stars.",1494460800,,722,4.041958041958042

PAPER MAN is a drama that borders on science fiction. Here, four students assign a credit card to a fake identity by manipulating data banks.

This made-for-TV movie long ago warned that tampering with then-burgeoning computer technology could have disastrous consequences.

8325895,5,B000X7SB3I,"Computing the way it was and the way they saw it would be in the future. Add to this a mystery that may rival Stephen King fans.

Avery Jensen (Dean Stockwell) is discussing how all the computers in town are linked together. Some rambunctious students see this as and advantage to getting a credit card. So they get fellow student, Karen McMillan (Stefanie Powers) and a young cutie to vamp Avery into making a man on paper. Everything is going swimmingly until the paper man purchase a gun and grows an unnecessary birth certificate. Now it looks as though the computer has a mind of its own and the creators are meeting with a mysterious demise. It also seems mysterious that Avery seems immune.

It is interesting to see the actors as they were in this movie the Lisa (Tina Chen) that teaches the computer to say breath (death) is in the movie ""Three Days of the Condor"".

8325897,2,B000X7SB3I,"As the previous reviewer has stated this film is a classic if you are into early computer technology.
I would give it five stars but I really can't.
The DVD I received from Reel Classic Films looks like a DVD-R and it doesn't have a menu screen, it just starts as soon as you put it in the player.
Now this wouldn't really be a problem but the transfer was bad.
The picture seemed continually out of focus and there was a lot of judder as the people moved. The sound was quite poor too.

Anyway two stars for a great film spoiled by a terrible DVD release.
Buyer beware.",1214352000,4,570,4.181818181818182
8325898,4,B000X7SB3I,"This is a futuristic view from 1971 of college students messing with database records and computer networks.  I saw this movie years ago before most people had ever heard of hacking. Back before before home computers had been invented, these students had unlimited access to the college's mainframe computer. Monitors were not used back then, so in the movie they interact with the computer through teletypes.  See the amazing high-tech sight of  every response being loudly and rapidly printed.
Attempts are made to awe viewers with impressive modern technology such as punched cards being read or sorted and also with views of large spinning reels of tape.  It was a moderately good mystery movie.  When I watched it in the early 1970's, I enjoyed the thought provoking futuristic ideas.  I still remember my amazement when they showed the mainframe computers late at night exchanging information with each other without the help of any human.  This was a view of the future from 1971.  By the way, the movie does not use the word ""hacker"" which did not mean what it means now anyway.",1044403200,4,1086,4.896174863387978
