2179466,4,B00069FKVE,"I just finished watching ""Edges of The Lord"", and I must say that I found it to be an incredible story about the life of a Jewish boy who had to move in with a catholic family in order to survive the time of the Holocaust. I'm not an expert but in my experience this movie was one of the best I've seen that was related to one of the worst times in history. I would recommend this movie for anyone interested in Period Drama.",1105056000,11,425,4.011764705882353
2179467,5,B00069FKVE,"The movie is as powerful as 'The Pianist' and 'Schindler's List'. It deals with children losing their innocence during the Second World War. The plot is excellent and the acting is superb (we have here not only Haley Joel Osment, but also another very talented young actor - Liam Hess; the Polish children did an excellent job as well).

I am a Pole and I am proud that such a good movie was shot in Poland, as Polish-American co-production. The crew itself is a mixture of Polish, British and American people - this fact itself makes the movie interesting to see.

I am happy that the movie has finally reached the States (in Poland it was issued on DVD two years ago).",1101254400,15,670,4.483606557377049
2179468,5,B00069FKVE,"This film's story could be compared to the classic resistance story 'Le Silence De La Mere' by Paul Vercors. It depicts actions taken by Polish people in their ordinary lives to counter the predations of the occupying Nazis. Actions which could have cost them their lives. It is not, however, a flagwaving tub thumper that rewrites history to make the Poles out to all be innocent angels. There were collaborators and Nazi sympathisers in every one of the allied nations, and this film shows that Poland was no different. Contrary to remarks by other reviewers, not all of the actors were employing fake accents, and not all of the fake accents were inaccurate (I speak as someone who knows people from that region of Poland). The reason for the use of actors from different nations would be that the production was made with money from more than one country, and also because a film with actors from different nations would have wider appeal. The accent issue does not detract from one's ability to watch the film, although I would argue that this is not a film that is there to entertain. It is there to give people pause for thought, and is therefore especially useful in these dark times when the far-right is on the rise across the UK, Europe, and much of the rest of the world.",1397347200,,1283,4.631578947368421

2179471,4,B00069FKVE,"This movie portrays how war and it's atrocities can and have forever affected children adversely. It was a bit disturbing, but also hopeful at the end.

2179472,5,B00069FKVE,"This is one of those undiscovered gems which I'm glad to have finally viewed. I believe this never saw theatrical release in the US and went straight to DVD. A pity really because it certainly merits multiple viewings, although the subject matter is one that is heartbreaking. The film's stars are all young children and the adults are more secondary characters, and the focus is on how these children and adolescents navigate life during a turbulent period, i.e. WW II.

12-year-old Romek is a Jewish boy who is sent away to a remote Polish village to live with a Catholic peasant and his family comprising his wife and two young sons. Romek (Haley Joel-Osment in a finely nuanced performance) is passed off as a relative of the farmer, Gniecio. Romek learns to adjust to this different life, always wary of who he is, and manages to get along with Wladek (the older boy), and young Tollo who is prone to dramatics. They form friendship with a young girl Maria and life seems idyllic, with the children learning Catechism from the village priest, played by Willem Dafoe. However, the children are not immune to the turmoil of the times - economic hardships necessitate desperate acts like keeping pigs (illegal under Nazi ruling) and the children witness terrible atrocities like villagers getting executed, and worse. A neighbor named Kluba is depicted as brutish and suspicious and his son is a tyrannical bully who gets off by preying on Jews who escape the trains bound for the camps.

Through all these events, young Romek tries desperately to understand the new world he is thrust into - and begins to take on the life of a village peasant boy. However, the darkness of the Holocaust gets increasingly closer to Romek, with events unfolding in a wholly unexpected and shocking manner that literally took my breath away. The film is rated R - there are scenes of brutality and violence, including a rape scene. This is nevertheless a great addition to any Holocaust film library, and I intend to watch it again, taking things in a little more slowly this time, for this is a multi-layered film that is intense as it is dark, with moments of beauty and horror, all seen through the eyes of children.",1390435200,,2204,4.767015706806283

2179477,5,B00069FKVE,"This film features remarkable performances by children as they deal with betrayal, sexuality, and violence.

Every cast member is excellent.

The setting is occupied Poland, 1942. There are not many films that explore this time and place.

Watch Liam Hess as Tolo. He accepts the burden of guilt for the deaths of his father and others, and attempts to atone. Very moving.

There are stunning colors throughout the filmmaking.

Read Elie Wiesel's Night, or Jerzy Kosinski's The Painted Bird, for literary treatments of this time and place.",1369094400,,539,5.149425287356322
2179478,4,B00069FKVE,"In German-occupied Krakow, a Jewish father and mother place their twelve-year-old son, Romek (Haley Joel Osment), with a Polish Gentile family living in the countryside just prior to the deportation of the Jews to extermination camps beginning in May 1942. Romek is not eagerly welcomed by the family's oldest son, Wladek (Richard Banel), but little Tolo (Liam Hess) takes a shine to him. Wladek's girlfriend, Maria (Olga Frycz), develops tender feelings for Romek, which further fuels the tension between the two boys.

Romek lives in constant anxiety as neighbors suspect he is a Jew and threaten to ""out"" him to the Germans both out of fear of reprisal and anti-Semitism. The gruff-but-caring local priest (Willem Dafoe) takes Romek under his wing and begins religious instruction for all the children as precocious Tolo strongly identifies with the suffering and redemptive Christ.

The children witness the horrors of the occupation and Holocaust, first as bystanders, then as victims, and finally as participants. Little Tolo makes the ultimate sacrifice believing he is expiating the sins of his family and humanity.

Edges of the Lord is an intense and moving film. The four children give fine performances, although the viewer must pay close attention to the dialogue which at times is difficult to follow. The interesting Tolo character reminded me just a bit of John Irving's redemptive Owen Meany/Simon Birch. Olga Frycz has since gone on to become an accomplished young actress. Beautiful Malgorzata Foremniak, one of Poland's most popular actresses, gives a fine performance as the Polish family's mother. When Malgosia's on screen it's impossible to take one's eyes off of her.

Director Jerzy Bogajewicz also wrote the screenplay of this 2001 Polish-American co-production. The film was not distributed in the US but went straight to DVD. Still, Edges of the Lord is well worth seeing even though it plays a bit loose with history. No Jewish professors and their families were living in comfortable apartments in Krakow by 1942. Also, Polish anti-Semitism is a bit watered down in this treatment whereas it was actually quite prevalent throughout interbellum and occupied Poland. Unfortunately, even today there are many in Poland and Polonia who have no use for those on the ""edges.""",1359072000,,2300,5.241847826086956

2179480,5,B00069FKVE,Edges of the Lord was an excellent movie.  I highly recommend it.  The cruelity of the Nazi's and today's cruelity of the radical Muslims are very similar.

2179481,5,B00069FKVE,"One cannot say you actually enjoy this film, though I do appreciate and enjoy the depiction of humanity vs inhumanity (on a mass scale). I believe all the actors did a great job especially Tolo; his child-like sacrifice will not soon be forgotten. Nor will the protagonist's partaking of the 'edges of the Lord.'  Very well put together, believable, heartrending and life affirming but my predominant emotion was sorrow.  And yet, people say 'we should just get over it, get past it for heaven's sake' re the Holocaust.  I am not even Jewish but it is unbelievable to me that anyone could feel that way.

2179487,5,B00069FKVE,Edges of the Lord is a GREAT movie set in the World War II era during the invasion of Poland.  It is about a family who does what they can to save their child from being captured because he is Jewish and details the risks taken by those who assist with the plan.

2179488,5,B00069FKVE,"This is the type of movie we only see from Europe. Very few American movies deal with the issues of childhood in a realistic manner and fewer still, deal with the issue of children growing up during a war without a Hollywood type exploitation. This film deserved greater distribution. Although not as lyrical as the excellent Island on Bird Street, this is a story that asks the viewer to decide just what sort of sacrifices he or she would have been willing to make in similar situations. As most of us are not involved in war, we must ask ourselves what are we willing to sacrifice on a daily basis for the good of society. If Haley and Wilhem had not been involved, this film would have had no American distribution at all. That is a shame. You must watch this film to fully understand and appreciate the significance of the title.",1197936000,,834,4.493421052631579

2179490,5,B00069FKVE,"What a movie! If you are a fan of Haley Joel Osment (what's not to love?) or even if you are not, this is a film that will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, with emotional twists and turns that left me gasping for air. This film was never theatrically released in the United States (I don't know why) but it is definitely available on DVD and definitely worth watching and sharing.

Osment plays a little Jewish boy who is sent away by his parents to hide in the country side where he must pretend to be Catholic. This means this little tiny child must understand what it is to be Jewish, why it is dangerous, what it means to be Catholic and why it is important. Finding a group of friends to play with, it is intriguing to watch how they interpret their own Catholicism, and how it is acted out within the context of WWII.

See this movie. Not to be missed.

2179491,5,B00069FKVE,"Edges of the Lord received very little publicity when it was released, and the American release went straight to DVD.  Yet this is a film that demands watching and more than once.  Haley Joel Osment gives possibly his best performance ever, and that says a lot considering his outstanding efforts in The Sixth Sense, Pay It Forward, A.I., and Second Hand Lions.  He portrays a young Jewish boy in Poland during the Nazi occupation, who is sent to live with a Catholic family in rural Poland, where he must pose as a Catholic in order to survive.  The only person, besides the family he is living with, who knows his true identity, is the village priest played by William Dafoe who gives an understated yet excellent performance.  The drama is intense throughout, but it builds to an even more intense climax.  All of the children in the movie give remarkable performances which further serve to show the true nature of what it was like to live under Nazi occupation whether a Jew or a Christian. This is a movie not to be missed, and it is a movie that should be watched together by families with children above age 12",1169856000,5,1118,4.565
2179492,5,B00069FKVE,"Similar to Pay It Forward, the boy (Haley Joel Osment) does a wonderful job of making one truly feel for the boy and the specific situation the boy is in. As the story winds on, how people treat other people is what impacted me the most. In other movies, I have seen horrible things done to the Jews during those times. I'm sure there were many more things done than I can imagine. However, this movie went way beyond zeroing in on how the Jews were treated.

The movie shows us that brutality was inflicted on not only the Jews, but many others too. Many know that the Jews were treated horribly back then and some people may even insincerely shake their heads and say ""Tsk tsk"" and think how it would not have affected them. If the insincere people saw this movie, they would understand that their own selfish selves would also be in danger and would hate the whole situation itself. The movie shows a place that is a Hades where evil actions were common. I am certain that many people shed tears during this awesome movie.

Although hate, a lack of respect for life, and murder ran unchecked, the movie also showed characters that had an understanding of how precious life is. These good people supported life and did the best they could at great risk to themselves. Their actions went way beyond religious tolerance. The actions showed a respect for people and their beliefs.

Words cannot do justice to this movie.",1158624000,7,1419,4.556862745098039
2179493,5,B00069FKVE,"The same director of the winner film Yol, wrote and directed a  remarkable and haunting picture about a Jewish boy who will experience in Poland the cruelties of the War in a double dimension: the Nazis and some nasty human beings in the town. A devastating, powerful gaze around the ashes of the War.",1148256000,3,301,4.574074074074074
2179494,5,B00069FKVE,"I made this selection based by ""judging the book by its cover"" so to speak. I saw Haley Joel Osmont on the cover, saw William Dafoe as a priest, quickly read the summary on the back and took no notice of the rating. I expected a kindly story about a young Jewish boy ""rescued"" by Christians in Poland during World War II and expected it to be moving and probably perfect for family viewing. Well, all I needed was one viewing to know I made wrong assumption, but making this wrong assumption and expecting a different film may be why this film moved me so.

The film tells the story of Romek, played by Osmont, who is sent to the Polish countryside to avoid being captured by the Nazis. The village may be remote, but it is hardly immune to the World War that is taking place. Romek has the expected scuffles with the village's children but eventually find his place.  Yet he also experiences the horrors that cannot be avoided in such a story.

Perhaps what makes this film outstanding is that it is not a typical Holocaust survival film. The film accurately portrays the moral ambiguities that were very much a part of life during the Second World War, especially for Europeans. We see a different type of Catholicism, not the often stereotypes Catholicism that is all too often seen in films, but the unique strain of Polish Catholicism. There is plenty of conflict in the film on many different levels. There are tensions between Romek and the other children that are typical of children's interactions, yet we also know that some of the conflicts are at a deeper level when people suspect why Romek is living in the village. We see the atrocities of war, but we see it through the beautiful acting and writing of the film and not through graphic gimmicks.

There are a number of elements in this film that will catch the viewer by surprise and in the end, make the viewer think. It is worth watching and without question will cause the viewer to think about the bravery of so many during the Second World War, the atrocities that were all too much a part of it, and how easily we can take human rights for granted. Yet surprisingly, while it can have all these elements, and not have the happiest of endings, it is in the end uplifting because in its own way, the human spirit triumphs.",1132012800,31,2291,4.5
2179495,5,B00069FKVE,"Though I have yet to see the film, I will admit to being intrigued.

I just wanted to point out to Mr. Harp that there is a vast difference in saying ""In the priest's cataclysm [sic] class..."" as opposed to ""catechism class,"" although I'm sure myriad fundamentalists would echo his sentiments.",1111795200,5,293,4.745098039215686
2179496,5,B00069FKVE,"EDGES OF THE LORD is a film that, once seen, creates in the viewer the need to call every friend and recommend their seeing it.  As conceived and directed by Yurek Bogayevicz and by using primarily a Polish cast shot on location in various areas of Poland, this film appears to be a simple tale of courage of a young Jewish boy Romek (Haley Joel Osment) whose parents wisely see the encroaching genocide by the Nazis and out of love, teach their son the basics of Catholicism so that Romek can pass as a Catholic and be placed with a Catholic family in order to save him from the Nazi exterminations.

Romek lands with a family whose children include an older child Vladek (Richard Banel) and a younger Tolo (Liam Hess).  The family understands that Romek is a Jew and even the young children incorporate that fact into their cohabitation.  The village priest (Willem Dafoe) likewise takes Romek under his wing and in a touching scene while the priest is cutting the 'hosts' for Catholic communion from a wafer sheet, he tells Romek that the uneven portions are the 'edges of the Lord' and therefore Romek may eat them as a Jew without betraying his own religious beliefs.

The boys are part of a circle of preadolescent friends which includes one girl Maria (Ola Frycz) who slowly warms to Romek.  In the priest's cataclysm class the children are assigned roles as Apostles and Tolo assumes the identity of Jesus.  It is this assumption of the life of Jesus (sneaking a crown of rose thorns under his cap, tying himself to a tree ('cross'), and ultimately making a sacrifice for Romek in imitation of Christ's mission) that provides some of the more exquisitely beautiful moments in this lovely film.

The story can be watched and absorbed on many levels: the effect of the atrocities of the Nazi occupation on Polish Jews, the sanctity of the family unit and the terror of living in an occupied country in the time of war, the delicate line children tread to become adults, the inhumanity of man as contrasted to the profound humanity of man - all of these threads are woven into this Polish tapestry of tremendous emotional impact.

While the performances by Osment and Dafoe are expectedly fine, the roles of the Polish actors - especially the incandescent Liam Hess as Tolo - are extraordinary. This is truly a masterful work that deserves a very wide audience.  Highly Recommended!  Grady Harp, January 2005",1105401600,101,2413,4.7214285714285715
2179497,5,B00069FKVE,"I just finished viewing this picture, ORDER IT TODAY!  It's rated ""R"", but we watched it with our children, to help them to understand the evil of that time in world history.  To reinforce the drive to avoid this at all costs.  We wanted to be there to answer the question that inevitably comes up, ""why are they so mean"".

Buy this picture and view yourself, but don't pass it up.  It was released in Poland 2 years ago, but not in the US until now, thank you for having the courage to do this.

This is yet another triumph for Haley Joel Osment, this young man has the ability to turn you on and off like a switch.  Haley where does you talent end, each picture is better than the last?  Please, please keep up the outstanding work.

I felt that the subplots weaving thought the picture were just perfect, the Priest who handed Haley an unblessed wafer at their first communion, (he understood that the boy did not feel comfortable and made it possible for him to continue his disguise), the your girl who wanted the have sex with him, the youngest brother how believes he is the Christ, and wants to suffer and die to return the world to where it was before the war, and many more.  You will want to watch this one 3, 4 or more times.

As a Jew I found his performance string and stunning.  The plot set against Word War II and Nazi occupation of Poland brings on memories of the holocaust, people murdered in cold blood, the trains, Oh those trains of helpless Jews going to their death, the tears rolled down my cheek.  I pray that we shall NEVER see such a thing happen again.  This is one of the most powerful holocaust pictures I have ever seen it is as powerful as ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"", it must be seen to be believed.

Addendum:  6/19/2011

As suggested below I have removed the description of a key seen from my review.  Now I have watched the movie again for the 5th time and I find its significance MUCH more relevant than some vignette from a bye gone era where most of us were not alive or like me to young to remember.

TODAY, Right now this movie MUST be seen by every American, NO every citizen who enjoys freedom, yes it is even more relevant now than it was back in the 1940's.  How quickly we forget, how quickly we put things behind us, 1000's of people are enduring the very same oppression and torture TODAY in the Middle East!  WHY DO WE LET IT HAPPEN, over and over again?

I urge you to buy it NOW before it goes out of print, watch it with your kids; yes I said your kids, your friends, your neighbors, and anyone who will come.  Then think about the kids who are dyeing today NOW in Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc.  Oh GOD how can we stop this?",1105142400,59,2698,4.276134122287968

It has been at least a year since I viewed it and few stories can grab you with the childhood innocence and childlike faith that this story embodies.

When a young Jewish boy is taken into a very poor farm family, few neighbor's believe he is their city cousin.  Though he is taken to Sunday Mass and begins to study for his first Holy Communion along with several other village children, a noisy neighbor begins to make threats that he will expose the truth to the authorities and attempts to blackmail the family.  As the story progresses, man's inhumanity to man is revealed and it would seem everyone in the village has a secret.  A great tragedy befalls this wonderful farm family.  The one young son suffering from dwarfism is a witness to the unvarnished reality of man's desperate corruption.  He takes the story of Christ's sacrifice to heart and has the other children reenact the crucifixion.  Soon thereafter he sees an opportunity to intentionally places himself in harm's way in his own desire to purify those in the village, who are so regrettably sinful.

It is a wonderful lesson in self-sacrifice and a reflection of Christ's great love for his brethren.  This is not a preachy story, it doesn't have to be, the interaction among the children clearly display how little acts of sin lead to bigger acts of atrocity.  I wonder if this is based on fact.  It's message is tremendously powerful.

I think this would make a great Youth Group Movie night and even offers wide appeal for the entire church body.",1410393600,,1661,4.624573378839591
