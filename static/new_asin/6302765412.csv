516701,4,6302765412,Enjoyable performance by Quaid & is semi-believeable in it's golf action & speak. Kathryn Harrold(?) does a good job as Quaids wife-to-leave. This is NOT a kids movie by any means............& I 2nd all the calls for a DVD version. This movie is worthy of it. Funny as hell in parts with Jack Warden.,1113004800,8,300,4.574074074074074
516702,5,6302765412,We Want DVD! We Want DVD! We Want DVD! We Want DVD! We Want DVD! We Want DVD! We Want DVD! We Want DVD! We Want DVD! We Want DVD!!!!  Get it in VHS if you absolutely must...  but this one deserves DVD.,1092441600,47,201,3.6511627906976742
516703,5,6302765412,"It's an absolute shame that this movie is not out on DVD.  Randy Quaid gives a great performance as an unfocused, over-partying bottom ranks PGA tour player whose marriage is on the rocks.  This movie is a perfect blend of humor and drama.  It is also as inspiring as Rudy and Hoosiers.",1083369600,15,286,4.461538461538462
516704,5,6302765412,"Looking for an in depth study of the psychology of being good at something?  Some insight into how women, male friends, helpers, sponsors and others play into that?  You might like this.  It's also a great lot of fun, and documents pretty accurately the golf scene of a few years ago.  Frankly, it hasn't changed that much, they still don't let the women play with the men.  But there are plenty of women playing with men in this movie.
I read the original Dan Jenkins novel some time back.  It was great, but more complex, and I sort of got lost in the clever details and missed the main themes.  But in the movie, which simplifies the novel for the sake of time, they come dramatically shining through.
The only complaint, other than it not being on DVD, is that there are one or two implausibilities, like Beverly getting up the day after surgery and going to a golf tournament.  I believe that's a change from the book.  But it's effective.  Oh, and did I mention, there's a great music soundtrack too.",1076457600,7,1006,4.478021978021978
516705,5,6302765412,"Move over Dorf and forget all about TIN CUP.  DEAD SOLID PERFECT is the best golf movie ever made.  It's on the same level as CADDYSHACK, only more mature, so as not to scare away the conservative duffers.  Randy Quaid and Jack Warden are wonderful and Corinne Bohrer is the cutest thing to ever grace the links this side of Annika Sorenstam.
It's criminal that DEAD SOLID PERFECT has not yet made an appearance on DVD.  It's funny, it's got nice production values, great acting, drama, and Corinne Bohrer.",1051056000,23,506,4.651685393258427
516706,3,6302765412,"Although not his biggest commercial success, `Dead Solid Perfect' may be the funniest book written by one of this country's great talents, Dan Jenkins.
In the text, there is a combination of comedic genius, and  a  true love for the subject matter, the game of golf. Add 50 some years of  experience reporting on the game, and Mr. Jenkins has just about every  aspect of this story nailed, cold.
I know many who think one of his  earlier books, Semi-Tough to be an exemplary piece of writing, I agree, but  the film it produced turned out luke-warm as best.
This film is better,  although it can not be described with  the superlatives of Jenkins  original. Sometimes it's just impossible to capture the essence of such  multi-layered characters on film in 2 hours or less.
Not to knock Bobby  Roth, or the two principals, Randy Quaid, and  Jack Warden who both did  good turns: Quaid as Kenny Lee, the  talented but struggling tour golfer  and Warden as ""Bad-Hair' Wimberly, the cash-rich sponsor. The  film  stumbles and rumbles to a storybook conclusion.
For golf fans it's a good  movie and certainly more honest and original than  Tin Cup. For the rest  I'd say only fair.",950227200,,1177,4.704433497536946

516708,2,6302765412,"Randy Quaid plays a stereotypical golf/athlete who cannot grow up and out of his passion and lack of passion for the game.  It is not only the precursor of Tin Cup, but it is a much better movie with certainly more  comedy, and gets at the heart of a good walk spoiled.  Certainly not a  grade ""A"" movie by any standards, but a nice ""B"" look  at the behind the scenes life of golf as evinced in Dan Jenkin's novel  expose.",938217600,3,422,4.148148148148148
516709,4,6302765412,"This is the poor man's Tin Cup...unrealistic much like Cup, but fun.  Randy Quaid plays the struggling, wanna be, tour pro and personifies the ""dead on"", albiet, stereotypical lifestyle of the borderline  professional athlete...living life to excess, drinking, gambling, and  womanizing.  After all, isn't this what life on the road in an old  convertible Caddie is all about. The golf scenes won't drive you to the  golf course to tee it up immediately after watching the movie, but there is  just enough substance here to keep you interested. And for those of you who  are slaves to cleavage, be sure to check out Quaid's girfriend Corrine  Bohrer...enough said.",913766400,6,664,5.074074074074074
516780,4,6302765412,where is the DVD version of this? I've been waiting for several years in hope of it's release but still no sign.  :-(,1250294400,,117,4.086956521739131
516781,5,6302765412,"This is, quite simply, the best golf movie ever made. Yes, it is low budget in the early days of HBO films, but it is a well-acted, well-written movie. Randy Quaid turns in a brilliant performance. The supporting cast is equally skilled. The writing is superb. This movie OUGHT to be released on DVD. A better cast, top to bottom, than Tin Cup (with apologies to Cheech Marin). THE golf movie.",1198886400,,393,4.549295774647887
516782,5,6302765412,"Best golf movie ever made.  Very faithful to Dan Jenkins book. Golf scenes are realistic (much better than Tin Cup). I would love to see it out on dvd, have been looking for it for years.",1190160000,,187,4.194444444444445
516783,5,6302765412,"As a former tour player now out of the game, this film captures alot of what the PGA tour used to be.  The race to ""Monday Qualifiers"" by what we were referred to as ""rabbits"" was filled with alot of the shenanigans this movie portrays. I'm sure the PGA wasn't especially thrilled with the movie, but this system produced greats like Trevino, Rodriguez, and many more.  Would love to see this movie out in DVD (haven't owned a VCR in years)soon!  As per other reviews, B movie with great content and storyline. Would by 10 DVD's for gifts for my golfing buddies!",1152403200,9,562,4.490196078431373
516784,5,6302765412,"I wrote HBO pictures a few years ago begging for a DVD release, and still we're forced to wait, and wait, and wait.

This is the quintessential golf movie.  While I enjoyed Tin Cup, it was nowhere near as engaging as Dead Solid Perfect.  This movie is very different than Caddyshack and equally as funny in parts.

Caddyshack's poking fun at the country club lifestyle and Dead Solid Perfect's views of being a PGA touring professional in the 80s are worlds apart, but the golf is what matters here.

DVD cannot come soon enough.  If you play golf and don't find yourself quoting this movie to your buddies on the golf course, something is definitely wrong.  Buy it on VHS if you have to, you will not be disappointed.",1144800000,6,718,4.51937984496124
516785,3,6302765412,"I haven't seen this VHS product, but I've seen the movie on cable TV. It's not the greatest movie, though it has its moments. The saving grace is that Corinne Bohrer is gorgeous in it. But I'm kind of biased. I've always been a Corinne Bohrer fan.

516786,5,6302765412,"Still underrated.  A great sports movie, and, for my money the best golf movie ever done.  It is a lot more believable than Tin Cup.  It also doesn't hurt that it has the greatest scene of brief, completely unnecessary nudity I've ever seen.

To quote one of the other reviewers: DVD - DVD - DVD - DVD.",1139184000,8,302,4.245614035087719

516789,4,6302765412,I watched the VHS version a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it and would place it up there with any sport movie.  Randy Quaid plays the character of a party animal golfer to a tee.  Why won't the studios listen to the public and release this as a DVD so those of us with taste can buy it to play it over and over.,1113436800,13,318,3.876923076923077
7831882,4,6302765412,"All you need to know about Randy Quaid, you can get from ""Dead Solid Perfect"" and ""Independence Day"". I liked both movies, but ""Dead Solid Perfect"" edges out ""Independence Day"" by a sliver thin margin. There are a few movies that HBO should release on modern format. Though you may never have heard of it, this is one of them. I saw Dead Solid Perfect many years before I started playing golf, once I saw it again, I liked it even more.",1465257600,,436,4.329268292682927

7831888,4,6302765412,I definitely second the motion to bring this movie out on DVD--if for no other reason than to get another look at Corinne going for ice.,1385683200,,136,4.269230769230769
7831889,3,6302765412,"A different kind of golf movie.  Acting is okay, and the plot is good.  I didn't remember the amount of swearing from when I first say it years ago.  Kind of embarrassing with my kids around.",1376265600,,191,4.25

7831891,4,6302765412,"yes, corinne borher is gorgeous in her own way and she does have that breathtaking ice-bucket scene, but kathryn harrold? wowser. as roy mcevoy once said, ""there's something about that chick.""

dan jenkins is, of course, one of the funniest writers ever, regardless of genre--he just happens to write sports--and he shows it to us through his own texas view-master.

it's a pretty good story about a never-was hanger-on on the PGA tour, the kind of marriage you might expect a par golfer on tour to have, and some of the best one-liners in filmdom: bad-hair wimberly talking about his folks: ""i got the finest kind of parents a man can have--rich and dead."" or kathryn harrold catting on her wayward husband's girlfriend in a conversation with him: (paraphrase) ""you were just kidding about her corrective shoes.""

effing classic.

oh yeah; WHERE'S THE DVD???",1306368000,2,859,4.944444444444445
