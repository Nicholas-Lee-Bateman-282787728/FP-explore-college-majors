2661377,5,B000ION2IK,"I LOVED this movie.  I am so glad I purchased it.  As an artist, I am continually appalled at the way greed and retrobution drives people and the ripple effect it has on the whole of humanity.  This gets to the heart of this movie and this true-life drama.  There's nothing charitable to say about the people who stole this art, whether alive or dead, but I hope the decendants of these people have the decency to return to Isabella's museum what is rightfully hers and stop being so, bloody-well IRISH!  (I can say that because I am Irish and it makes my blood boil to learn that it is Irishmen suspected of stealing these treasures.  You are better than that!)",1187740800,5,662,4.429752066115703
2661378,5,B000ION2IK,In fact I would reccomend seeing this and then going to the Isabela Stuart Gardner Museum in Boston. This is a really compelling documentary about the infamous are heist at the Gardner Museum in 1990.  It is frustrating and sad to have these works missing and perhaps poorly maintained.  The characters involved in the story range from a devoted stolen art private investigator who has had skin cancer for 50 years to FBI agents and con artists who are all involved in the game of getting them back.  This is a must see to anyone who loves art.,1163548800,23,544,4.530612244897959
2661408,5,B000ION2IK,"This documentary is an excellent example of what happens when the brain-dead are left in charge.
Several questions present themselves immediately, with respect to securing the museum's treasures.

1. At what point was it decided to house priceless art in a building with so many windows?
2. Who thought it was a good idea to staff the night-shift with only two ""security guards""?
3. *Why no security systems upgrade? Wouldn't the museum's insurance carrier insist state of the art technology  be implemented? (See asterisked comment below)
4. In his entire career, if Harold Smith was ever successful in tracking down stolen art it was due to fool's luck and not exceptional sleuthing.

It's a shame these masterpieces were literally given away. What an embarrassment.

*After a bit of research, I discovered the museum carried no theft insurance at the time of the heist.
It boggles the mind.",1403740800,,893,5.054421768707483
2661409,3,B000ION2IK,"Was interesting docu, full of improbable people, instructive insight, but as of now, badly in need of updating,,,,, if yur up on current hapoenings and add that knowledge to what yur seeing, its worth the watch..",1393459200,,212,4.916666666666667
2661410,4,B000ION2IK,"I've been to the Isabella Stewart Gardner many times and finally decided I needed to know all I could about the 1990 art theft. this documentary provided all I needed to know about the investigation, suspects, main players.",1392249600,,223,4.894736842105263
2661411,3,B000ION2IK,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed with this movie.  Although the acting was good the story was common.  In other words...I'VE SEEN MOVIES LIKE THIS BEFORE.  Still, I would recommend it for those who don't mind repeats.",1325116800,,228,4.65
2661412,1,B000ION2IK,"Although the Gardner art theft is a fascinating topic, this documentary is imminently boring.  This film has an odd, depressing pace with an equally depressing soundtrack.  Much footage is shot with a shaky, handheld, video camera and the film is poorly edited.  It smacks of an amateurish documentary - a film student's first attempt at his craft - with every cheap film transition and filter in the editing software trotted out to try to add interest via special effects because the film itself is so utterly lacking.

The presentation is somewhat disjointed.  It doesn't give the viewer a particularly good account of this famous theft, but sort of jumps between interviews with some of the peripheral players in the story.  Along with the discomfort imparted by the the shaky camera, bad composition and poor editing, it is often hard to watch in part due to an exceedingly strange looking cast of characters.

If you wish to learn about this famous and still unsolved art theft, you would do better to pass on this movie and to read instead&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gardner-Heist-The-True-Story-of-the-World-s-Largest-Unsolved-Art-Theft/dp/0061451843/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gardner Heist: The True Story of the World's Largest Unsolved Art Theft</a>.",1295308800,8,1317,5.7927461139896375
2661413,5,B000ION2IK,"This is a must see. A great documentary. Tells of the woman who built the museum and the inspiration for it. I loved that part. Actually, the first black and white picture that they should of her bust she reminded me of the wicked witch from the Wizard of Oz. I think it was the outfit.  Harold Smith had a story to tell in his lifetime, poor guy. I thought it was a surprise ending to see who they think could have helped to get the pictures back. A must see for everyone. An important part of history. Ciao",1278979200,2,508,4.1313131313131315
2661414,5,B000ION2IK,"wondering where ""the Concert"" might be hidden, who is responsible, and you'll shake your head at the sheer audacity of this theft. It was something that sounded like fiction when it happened and watching this will even make you worry that the piece and the others are at the very least stored and archived safely.

I for one would like to live to see the day that ""the Concert"" is put back in its frame and to know where it's been all these years. The film will have that effect on you; even if you know nothing about the Gardner Museum heist, you'll come to the end of it caring about these works!",1229904000,,598,4.292035398230088
2661415,5,B000ION2IK,"The Gardner Museum is an enormous collection of valuable art collected by a woman who was obsessed with acquiring the best for her extraordinary home. The unsolved theft of millions of dollars of art one night remains one of Boston's most discussed crimes. There are mountains of speculation. The film brilliantly weaves an important art appreciation component into the story line.
If you appreciate art, love an unsolved mystery, and want to see the strange characters involved in the hidden world of art theft - this is for you.",1218931200,4,530,4.966292134831461
2661416,4,B000ION2IK,Good look at trying to find stolen art. The art investigator himself is really the best part of the story. Would only recommend if you have serious interest in stolen art & their museums.,1213574400,,187,4.529411764705882
2661417,5,B000ION2IK,"STOLEN is an absorbing and truly informational look at the seedy side of the antique and art dealer world as seen through the still-unsolved St. Patrick's Day heist that occurred at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The documentary involves the present day characters who could have been involved and those who have been trying to crack the case since 1990. The narration of Blythe Danner and Campbell Scott re-enact the relationship of Mrs. Gardner and her art purchaser Bernard Berenson from the late 1800's in order to show the obsession that Gardner had in procuring these rare art treasures and the lengths that people even then would go to to get famous paintings. This theme of underworld is woven skillfully by film maker Rebecca Dreyfus as she shows how complex cell groups  continue to operate in art thievery and their motivations, quite contrary to ""the love of art""! .Also, the documentary is a fascinating look at the paintings by Vermeer, Rembrandt and others that were stolen and why specifically these works. A great discussion and informational documentary that is very compelling and full of true life mystery and possible political intrigue that seems to only appear in Hollywood, but in fact exists in truth!",1196640000,15,1242,5.029126213592233

8147065,1,B000ION2IK,"After I rented the movie (stolen) I tried to view it on my kindle, but was unable to stream it.  So I contacted Amazon via telephone to try and find out why I was not able to see it.  After several attempts by your tecks it was finally determined there was something wrong with this video, and not my kindle or wifi connection.",1416182400,,327,4.174603174603175
8147066,3,B000ION2IK,"I expected a straightforward documentary about the art works stolen from the Gardener Museum in Boston. That may have been what the documentary makers set out to do. What I saw was a quirky documentary style film about the quirky people who are drawn to the search for stolen art. I'm not going to summarize the narrative, since it doesn't really have one. Yet the desire to find the works of art does create suspense. I would suggest seeing this film if you, like me enjoy getting to know different kinds of people",1410048000,,515,4.548387096774194
8147067,5,B000ION2IK,Great movie.,1409356800,,12,5.5
8147068,2,B000ION2IK,"At times, the movie seemed comic and melodramatic. It also seemed that the world of stolen art was somewhat a game. Though I must say, if one likes quiet intrigue, this may be your movie.",1407974400,,187,4.371428571428571
8147069,2,B000ION2IK,"This is a rather old documentary on the theft of the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum in Boston. In march 1990, thieves broke into the museum stealing priceless paintings, among them Vermeer's ""The Concert.""
The film follows real life art investigator Harold Smith looking for clues and hunting down leads. All of which do not pan out.
There's a lot of inter cutting of history, and archival footage of Gardner and her museum and her thirst to acquire the best the art world could offer, of course for a handsome price, with current footage of Smith on the trail.
Now, much of the film seems like reality shows of today, ""Hunting for Bigfoot,"" ""Area 51,"" ""Are Chupacabras Real?"" There's no resolution. And with the seedy people Smith encounters and the wild speculations, finding those artwork would be next to impossible. As of today, none of those paintings have been found.",1407974400,,875,4.879194630872483

8147071,1,B000ION2IK,Not very good.,1407542400,,14,4.0
8147072,5,B000ION2IK,"""Stolen"" was a very fascinating story, and did a very good job weaving the numerous people involved, the theft, and all the historical and current details, so it was understandable, and entertaining,  especially with respect to Mrs. Gardner, who was quite the character!

However, I do agree with another reviewer, (I'd have to leave this page to get the correct name) that the ""score"" of a documentary is usually so eerie and depressing.  This was not quite as bad as some, but either budgets don't allow for better music, and/or/ because the subjects of documentaries are usually serious, like corporations polluting the water of a town, they feel they have to use a sort of funeral dirge to accompany the story, to show reverence or something.  I think it's the money, though.",1407196800,,779,4.878787878787879
