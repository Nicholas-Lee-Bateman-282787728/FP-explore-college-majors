959625,5,6305063516,"As a devoted fan of gothic horror, I can say that this double feature was a real treat.  It contains two beautiful Hammer classics that deal with the living dead.  Released in 1966, when Hammer Production was at its peak, both movies make great midnight viewing.

  ""The Mummy's Shroud"" takes place primarily in Cairo, Egypt in 1920.  An archaeological team has found the mummified remains of a child who was an Egyptian prince in 2000 B.C.  Naturally, there is a curse that begins killing everyone who entered the sacred tomb.  What distinguishes this mummy feature from all the others?  It is the prince's mummified servant who is brought to life and kills.  Some of the deaths are quite gruesome, especially that of the man who is thrown onto his bed, wrapped up in his sheets, and tossed out the window - quite heart pounding.  The shroud that was stolen from the mummified prince must be found; only it can stop the violence.

  ""The Plague of the Zombies"" is set in the English countryside of the 1800s.  It is action packed from beginning to end and has a high body count.  At least twelve villagers have died under mysterious circumstances when a doctor arrives to investigate a plague.  Upon further investigation, it is learned that their graves are empty.  How and why have the dead risen?  There is a conspiracy involving a rich man who controls the village and the evil young men who are living with him.  Blood sacrifices, voodoo rituals, and an abandoned mine play important roles in this creepy, atmospheric gothic horror.  I only wish Hammer Production had made more zombie features as they did with the vampire, mummy, and Frankenstein monster.

  This DVD is highly recommended for fans of gothic horror, Hammer films, and the living dead.  ""The Mummy's Shroud"" and ""The Plague of the Zombies"" are perfect together, especially since they were both produced by Anthony Nelson-Keys and directed by John Gilling.",1216166400,16,1928,4.840490797546012

959629,3,6305063516,"That's the tagline for The Mummy's Shroud (1967), adapted for the screen and directed by John Gilling, a prolific artist mainly associated with Hammer films whose best film, in my opinion, was 1967' Plague of the Zombies, and, while `Shroud' may not measure up to that film, it's certainly worth a look.  The film brings together a fairly strong cast, including Andr Morell (Plague of the Zombies), John Phillips (Village of the Damned), David Buck, host for the 60's British Television show Mystery and Imagination, Michael Ripper (The Reptile), and Maggie Kimberly (The Conqueror Worm).

As the film begins, we're in ancient Egypt, as a tale of a greed and deception unfolds, one that leads to the untimely death of a young pharaoh named Kah-to-Bey, and also of his sworn protector/slave named Prem.  Fast-forward to the 1920's, and we now bare witness to a British archeological team, led by Sir Basil Walden (Morell) seeking to locate the tomb of Kah-to-Bey.  Also included in the group is Paul Preston (Buck), whose father is financing the entire affair, Claire, assistant to Sir Basil, and a photographer who's name isn't really important as it soon becomes apparent through lack of character development he'll probably meet his maker in the not too distant future (and he does).  The search has yet to bear fruit, and things go from bad to worse as the team doesn't return and is thought lost in the expansive deserts of Egypt.  These recent events have prompted Paul's father, Stanley Preston (Phillips), to make the trip, presumably due to concerns for his son's safety, but that turns out not to be the case, as his motivations reveal him as an intrinsically flawed character, intent on protecting his investments and securing the acclaim and recognition he believes rightfully to be his, even though his contribution only extends to the financing portion.  As Paul's father gets cornered into joining one of the search parties currently setting out to locate the original group, Sir Basil and his entourage manage to find the tomb.  Stanley Preston and his rescue party locate the `lost' party, and they uncover the hidden resting place of the pharaoh, and the obligatory curse is presented, you know the one, that states anyone desecrating the tomb shall meet a gruesome death and such, which no one takes seriously, except maybe for Claire.  The group returns to civilization with their find, but soon find death not far behind...death in cloth wrapped feet...

Firstly, I have yet to see anyone come close to the Mummy character presented by Boris Karloff from the 30's Universal film.  He made the role his own, given his ability to imbue so much into the character without even having to say a word.  Subsequently, I have a slight negative bias to usurpers to the throne.  That being said, I did enjoy this film, despite a few minor flaws.  Gilling is an excellent director and scripter, as evident here.  His story is very solid, and even though there's a huge amount of predictability inherent in the story, he manages to really deliver dense, intricate plot with a few well develop characters, even throwing in the occasional twist.  I think my favorite character was Stanley Preston, played by John Phillips, as he was just such a colossally dislikeable character, but also the most interesting.  The character I liked the least was a tie between Paul and Claire.  The character of Paul had not nearly enough depth, and he just never exuded what I expect from a leading male character.  I never felt he could actually get the job done.  And the character of Claire?  Well, she was just very odd looking, almost frog-like with her bug eyes (nice rack, though), and also, her character seemed to lack the depth I would have preferred from the lead female in a film.  So how was the Mummy in this film?  A bit too plump for my tastes...I expect a character, dead for thousands of years, to show a certain level of desiccation, as seen in previous Hammer Mummy films.  Also, I think someone else mentioned this, and I would agree in that the creature's bandages didn't convey the feel necessary to be completely convincing.  The two biggest flaws, in my opinion, involve plot elements featuring a wild-eyed fellow with bad teeth, in charge of guarding the pharaoh's tomb, who issues a threat to the group prior to their entering the burial chambers.  Seems to me, once the killings of individuals who were present in the tomb started, the surviving associates might mention this guy as a possible suspect to the police, who are finding the investigation of said killings going nowhere fast.  We later find he has the ability to control the Mummy, summon its' spirit forth to kill the desecraters by holding the pharaoh's burial shroud and speaking forth certain words, a fact he later proclaims during the dramatic last scenes, with said proclamation leading to his own downfall just before his enemies, the last of the defilers, are about to meet their doom.  It reminded me of the obligatory scene in a James Bond film where the villain, having Agent 007 in a rather precarious situation, begins to detail their grand scheme, as the only real obstacle to their machinations is about to die.  While not on that large of a scale here, it provides the same effect, that of allowing the doomed character(s) time and/or opportunity to escape their impending fate and turn the tables on the big-mouthed numbskull.  Somebody should have told him loose lips sink ships...

The wide screen picture presented on this DVD looks wonderful and there's a pretty decent amount of special features including theatrical trailers for the film, TV spots, a World of Hammer episode entitled Mummies, Werewolves & The Living Dead, and a small reproduction of an original poster for the film enclosed within the case.  Final verdict?  I'd say 3  stars for the film and the features.

959632,3,6305063516,"Hammer's third Mummy film follows a fairly typical script, but is overall better than most people give it credit for. A tomb is disturbed and a curse is put on all those who entered the tomb, sound familiar?The films is somewhat slow, but really picks up about a half an hour into it. The excavation set was better than I thought, but the museum looked more like a small storage area than a place where valuable artifacts would be housed.  The mummy overall looked pretty good. There is one scene that always bothered me and that is when David Buck puts a hatchet into it's neck, you can tell it is a dummy that is maybe 2/3's the size of the guy playing the mummy. It is really kind of bad when you look at the earlier impaling scene which looks pretty good, but I would think that scene would have mush harder to do than a hatchet in the shoulder. I also got a little annoyed at the gypsy women who overacts to the hilt. Still, this film has a fairly good cast and it remains interesting. This is probably Michael Ripper's best role for Hammer and it certainly better than it's companion film Frankenstein created woman.",971827200,10,1122,4.394230769230769
959765,3,6305063516,"""The Mummy's Shroud"" (1967) movie is the third mummy entry from the Hammer Studios. This one suffers from poor sets but the first-rate cast and more violence carries it above average.  The film takes place primarily in Cairo, Egypt in 1920 where an archeological group (led by Andre Morrell) is lost while searching for the resting place of Prince Kah-to Bey. The team has eventually finds the mummified remains of a child and re-unites it with the mummy of the prince's bodyguard, Prem (Dickie Owen) who had been mistakenly buried as the prince. Once the two mummies are re-united, a loyal Egyptian, Hasmid (Roger Delgado) unleashes the wrath of Prem on those who disturb his prince's resting place. What sets apart this mummy is the gruesome nature of the deaths and the script.  In the end, Prem is destroyed when the words of death are uttered. Overall, this was a weak entry but Hammer still pulls it off thanks to a talented cast that includes, Andre Morrrell, John Phillips, Michael Ripper, David Buck, Richard Warner and Dickie Owen.",1369699200,,1041,4.842696629213483
959766,5,6305063516,As always Hammer Studio's still made in my piont of view the best horror pictures.

959767,3,6305063516,"DVD transfer:  very good to excellent.  Vibrant colors in the Mummy's Shroud stand out.

One thing about Hammer, they knew how to make period films. At one time, Hammer's warehouse of set-pieces, props and costumes must have been overflowing.  These two films owe a lot to the care taken in set design.  Scary stuff is a little harder to come by.

The Mummy's Shroud follows, to some extent, the old curse legend from the original finding of King Tut's tomb in the mid 1920's.  This film is set in that time in Egypt.  Researchers find a tomb of an ancient boy king and invoke the curse attached to the grave.  After that, members of the expedition are attacked by an ancient mummy.  This is a great looking film.  Only the mummy is a little hokey but that's not a big set back.

The Plague of Zombies is set in the 19th century in rural England (a favorite of Hammer's) and is darker than the first film.  I like the fact that Hammer didn't do a lot of ""zombie"" characters but kept them mostly in the shadows.  Borrowing somewhat from Val Lewton films, we build suspense, fear and even horror without an over-abundance of special effects.  I actually like this film better because the atmosphere is closer to the better Hammer films.

Recommended for:  PG oriented audiences.  The violence is minimal.",1296604800,3,1302,4.586956521739131
959768,4,6305063516,"If you like the older universal mummy series and I do then you will like this one. It's very similiar to them only it's in color. It has several excellent actors in it and including the actor who played the master on dr. who in the seventies. The story is much like the rest with archeologists disturbing a tomb and a mummy being resurrected to wreak vengeance. One reviewer said this wasn't scary however if a indestructible mummy did come after you it would be very scary. And the story is taking place back in the 20's when the publics knowledge of horror situations was very limited to say the least.  The film was shot in the sixties by the great hammer studios who were at their peak , they still had a another decade and another mummy movie to go before they collapsed. This is traditional horror and if you like traditional horror and older horror films then this is right up your alley. I love older horror and can find gems right back into the silent days but hammers efforts often had a gothic quality that someone needs to rediscover for a flick or two.",1287792000,,1065,4.406091370558376
959769,3,6305063516,"An expedition in Egypt circa 1920 results in the discovery of a long lost prince's tomb left in a cave in limited conditions by his slave. Among the expeditors is Claire, the crew's language expert who refuses to translate the message on a shroud that covered the prince's corpse. Perhaps Claire's name was inadvertently deemed short for clairvoyant, as the current keeper of said tomb is all too eager to recite the shroud's words in its original tongue and thus resurrects the mummified slave to enact revenge to those who disturbed his prince's final resting place. Third of the Mummy films released by Hammer Studios (all of which are unrelated to one another) and perhaps would be considered the weakest entry of the bandaged bunch. Additionally, the title monster's make-up is below average and lazy at best. Still, an adequate Mummy movie offering that you don't have to get too wrapped up in to follow. Note: Among the extras in this Anchor Bay release is a 25 minute ""World of Hammer"" episode focusing on Mummies, Werewolves and the Living Dead and narrated by Hammer alum Oliver Reed.

When I ordered this movie a few days ago I didn't realize I had already seen it.  The title ""Plague of the Zombies"" didn't ring any bells.  After the fox hunters kidnaped Andre Morell's daughter, though, I remembered that I had already seen it.

This is an excellent Hammer horror movie that few people have ever heard of.  I don't why the movie gets so little exposure.  It's right up there with the best of Hammer's horror flicks.  It has a great gothic ambience, a tight story line, smart direction, and a skillful cast.  The zombies may seem cheesy by today's standards, but they still spooked me.  If you like horror movies, don't miss this one.  There isn't much blood and gore, but if ""Plague of the Zombies"" proves anything, it's that you don't need them to serve up the chills.
