8488582,3,B005XC5YYW,"I purchased this DVD to help me research and investigate the UFO and Bible connection. How would this play out in the near future when the church is raptured out of this world. This documentary would have been alot better if he had used more visual aids. You can only capture the audience attention for so long being in front of the camera. Moving around would have helped also,rather than just standing in front of the camera the whole time. While he did provide some,it was not nearly enough to help his arguement. One thing I found odd out of place is when he started using numbers to justify his Biblical Prophecies. It became annoying,You can not reduce the grace of God to mere numbers and how they add up. Be warned,if you purchase this DVD,have plenty of coffee or soda to keep you attentive to the subject he is covering. Don't get me wrong,it's good material for reference,but he needed more visual aids to help it move along.",1348444800,2,936,4.544378698224852
