3154385,3,B00168OIIU,"I cant doubt it: this is one of the most must have movies that anyone could buy, even more on blu ray format. However the Question is: Whats Wrong Between Disney and Latin Fans? just simple to explain the question: Pinocchio for example, included the blu ray format movie and a digital copy on DVD. DVD had spanish language track, but Blu ray. Same for Sleeping Beauty. Also, the bonus features do include subtitles, and even games include spanish track. Taking the fact that bluy ray format was meant to be the same for Canada, USA and all latinamerica *and not DVD*, why disney is excluding Spanish Language Track, even when they did have the sources to include it on DVD? as far as i know, A Bug's Life won't include Spanish Language Track, just as they did for DVD before. I don`t think it is for business reasons, or to protect the latinamerica market. I just hope they include in this fantastic movie all the sources they can include, to make bluy ray disc ""A"" region, just what it was meant to be: A Global Choice for all the Americas.",1241481600,3,1042,4.460732984293194

A thorough list of extras and all of the blooper clips only added to the overall satisfaction.  I already owned the Cars BD, so I was pleased to add this movie as well.  The PQ is clearly a 5/5 even though the animation clearly shows this to be early in the Pixar lineup.  The AQ earns a hands-down 5/5 as well.  What little .1 present is primarily from the wings of the grasshoppers and the rhino-beetle ""Dim"", but it's rich and thunderous, not boomie.  All dialog was clear and supporting ambient sounds are present from the BD menu all the way to the end of the movie.

I haven't tried any extra features with the blu-ray version and only have the picture quality to compare.  The blu-ray version is more sharp, but the DVD version was pretty good to begin with.

It is a story about an ant colony led by Flik (Dave Foley).  Flik seems to always cause trouble although he only means well.  They have grasshopper landlords it seems as they have to assemble food to feed them regularly 0 like a tax or payoff to the mob.  Flik seeks help from a buggy circus, which includes a spider, caterpillar, fleas, and other odd bugs.  He thinks they will scare the grasshoppers, but they realize this may not work.  Several schemes are hatched including a mock-up bird made of sticks and leaves.

Disney/Pixar like to boast that 'not a pixel is out of place' with their blu-ray transfers and that is so true about this blu-ray. It is simply brilliant. There are absolutely no faults in the transfer. Pixar may have done better with their animation in later CGI classics, but a Bug's Life is still a remarkable feat of the imagination. It appeals equally well to both kids and adults. There's plenty of humor too. This is one of those discs that you should own if you have a blu-ray player. I have seen the DVD of this movie, which was very good, but the blu-ray simply blows it out of the water. Highly recommended.",1251763200,3,710,4.345864661654136

3154432,5,B00168OIIU,"Back in 1998, Pixar Animation Studios and Disney released their second film.  Coming off the emotional high from ""TOY STORY"", Directors John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton began working on ""A BUG'S LIFE"" which cost around $45 million to make and brought in over $363 million worldwide.

The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews and featured an all star cast starring Dave Foley (""The Kids in the Hall"", ""NewsRadio"", etc.), Kevin Spacey (""The Usual Suspects"", ""Se7en"", ""L.A. Confidential""), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (""Seinfeld"", ""Saturday Night Live""), a young Hayden Panettiere (""HEROES""), comedians Denis Leary, Madeline Kahn, Phyllis Diller and Bonnie Hunt, Richard Kind (""Spin City"", ""Mad About You""), David Hyde Pearce (""Frazier""), Brad Garrett (""Everybody Loves Raymond"") and Roddy McDowell (""Planet of the Apes"", ""Cleopatra"") to name a few.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

When the first DVD came out for ""A BUG'S LIFE"" in 1999, it received rave reviews for being a complete digital transfer.  And of course, since the film's release in 1998, we have seen how Pixar animation has come to evolve in the last eleven years and pushing animation technology as far as they can go.

With that being said, ""A BUG'S LIFE"", even though its been a decade since its release, looks absolute magnificent on Blu-ray.  Feature in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:35:1, the animation looks absolute crystal clear.  The animation is quite vibrant in colors, lush and green for the grass, the browns of the dirt, the blues of the sky and the blacks are nice and deep.  There is nothing bad that can be said about the picture quality.  It's an animation that was created in digital and looks absolute awesome on Blu-ray.  No artifacts, no blemishes, no dust, bad particles or anything negative.  The picture quality is colorful, clear and vibrant!

As for audio, the audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and sounds absolutely superb.  The sound is literally coming from all directions and really good utilization of rear surrounds and separating audio.  I have a 7.2 setup and scenes such as the grasshoppers flying, to the sounds of thunder and a variety of sounds with music all coming together definitely makes an immersive, audio experience.

It's important to note that my receiver doesn't shown the DTS-HD Master Audio and shows up as ES.  There is speculation that the audio is featured not in 5.1 but in 6.1.

The special treatment that Walt Disney has put in their animated releases on Blu-ray have been nothing short of phenomenal, it doesn't matter if the film is 10 years or 70 years later, the picture and audio quality of these releases have been outstanding.  ""A BUG'S LIFE"" is yet another fabulous release on Blu-ray!

JUDGMENT CALL:

Also, included is a MovieCash Code with a printable voucher for the upcoming animated film ""Up"" and a second disc which is a digital copy of the film.

""A BUG'S LIFE"" is just a fantastic Blu-ray release.  I've always looked at the storyline is like a hilarious, enjoyable and child-friendly, animated nod to Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" but its overall storyline and presentation was just incredibly done.  The film was financially successful and it was quite interesting to see this film and DreamWorks Animation's ""ANTZ"" go head to head in the box office that year.

It's been a long time since I first seen ""A BUG'S LIFE"".  The first thing that catches your eye is how beautiful the film looks even though it is over a decade old but then once you start seeing the dirt and detail of an animated film created by Pixar at that time, you realized how much farther Pixar has come since 1998.

You can look at the characters now and just imagine if they looked this good then, can you imagine how much detail into the actual characters that Pixar would probably go crazy if they worked on a sequel (with a total of three films for ""TOY STORY"", with the success of this film, I was hoping a sequel for more adventures with Flik).

There is really nothing negative I can say about this release.  The 2003 DVD release was among the most fantastic Walt Disney animated releases ever as it really goes into the making of the film and for any Pixar fan or animator, this DVD was just magnificent to own.

What is awesome about ""A BUG'S LIFE"" and watching it ten years later is that the story is well-written and the acting is well-done.  It's one thing to have awesome animation but if the storyline is not enjoyable, then the experience is not exactly wonderful.  With this film,  you have a good group all-star talent involved in this film and the I found the acting to be well done.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus and her well-known laugh, Kevin Spacey's brooding vocals and of course, Dave Foley does a magnifcent job as Flik.  But the list goes on, these talents did such a fantastic job on this film.  It's also important to note that if you are big fans of legendary talents Madeline Kahn and Roddy McDowall, this animated film was their final film.

Now let's assume that you own the original 1999 or the 2003 DVD version and are wondering if you should double dip and re-purchase this film on Blu-ray.  My answer is YES!!!

This is the definitive version to own of ""A BUG'S LIFE"" as the picture and audio quality is just phenomenal in High Definition.  I can continue to give you many reasons of how awesome the picture and audio quality are and how incredible this film is, but you also get more special features included only on this Blu-ray release.  Moreso, than the 2003 DVD edition and these newer bonus features are presented in HD.  The overall presentation of this release alone outshines the 2003 DVD (and that DVD release was magnificent).  If you own an HD setup, you're definitely going to appreciate this release!

Overall, ""A BUG'S LIFE"" is highly recommended! A+!",1243641600,3,8928,4.918120805369128
3154433,5,B00168OIIU,"The Movie:
Following the commercial success of Toy Story, Pixar's first outing into cinema, comes ""A Bug's Life."" This film, though not as charming as Toy Story, is still wonderfully crafted by the geniuses behind the scenes. The story follows the adventure of Flik, an ant inventor, who seems to find himself in trouble more often than not. After a series of events, all of the food that the ants collect as an offering to a band of grasshoppers that harrass their colony is gone, dropped into the water surrounding the island that the colony is on. Poor Flik is to blame. Quickly after a meeting between the Ant Queen, Princess Ada, and the advisors of the colony, Flik is sent out to find some warrior bugs to fight off the grasshoppers. What ensues is a hilarous misunderstanding, that leads to your typical confrontation of good vs evil. The pace of the movie is great, and the visuals (per 1999) are amazing. John Lasseter knows how to treat his audience, and we get what we want to see, the perspective of the world from a bug's view. Taking story elements from ""Seven Samurai,"" the film is about standing up for what is right, even if confronted with insanely big obstacles. The voice actors, specially Kevin Spacey as Hopper, seem to have a blast, giving an extra amount of charisma to the film. The main reason why this movie is a success is because, like all Pixar films, it has a heart, and it always will.
5 out of 5.

The Blu-Ray:
Video:
WOW! I have to give Kudos to Disney. They have yet failed to impress me with any of their Blu-Ray releases. There is not a blemish or artifact to be found. Straight from the digital transfer, the colors are perfectly balanced and varied, while blacks are as deep as they can be. This is a pristine transfer, with no imperfections what-so-ever.
5 out of 5.

Audio:
I was very impressed by the video, but I was blown away by the DTS-HD MA mix on this Blu-Ray. MY GOODNESS! I never thought I would say this, but this is the perfect mix. It even tops Wall-E (IMO) in every aspect. Surround use is constant and directionality is like no other. The perfect demo scene would be when the rains begins. The bass of the drops, the clarity of the screams, it all weaves together to form an audio experience like no other. Just perfect!
5 out of 5.

Overall, this is a wonderful Blu-Ray. Great, fun movie, with a wonderful transfer, and an audio mix that is demo-worthy. My hat goes off to Disney.",1243468800,,2437,4.47191011235955

3154435,5,B00168OIIU,"I know A Bugs Life probably isn't the highest rated Pixar film around, but I really like it. I had this on preorder for quite a while and finally got it in this week.

We got a chance to sit down and watch it last night and it looks ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! The detail and the color is so perfect. You could see every little pebble in the ant hill. I saw detail that I would have never even thought should be there before.

Pixar makes some good quality movies and after viewing this, I'm very much looking forward to buying many more Pixar films on Blu-Ray.",1242864000,2,553,4.2075471698113205
3154436,4,B00168OIIU,"My review is for the Blu-Ray version of ""A Bug's Life"". I will not over the plot since there are multiple reviews about it.
VIDEO:
The graphics are awesome, especially the landscapes and the overall environment. However, I was slightly disappointed with the graphics of the ants and some of the insects that looked poorly rendered CGI material, which sorely stands out in Blu-Ray version. Yes, I still have in mind that the movie was made in 1999 and was Pixar's second movie.
AUDIO
The audio was awesome. Lossless audio makes a difference here, especially when the grasshoppers leave the cantina at the dessert. It is just fantastic

Overall, I enjoyed the movie. I am true fan of Pixar's movie (I have all the releases in BD). Maybe this movie is not at the same level of other great titles like Ratatouille. I know we should not compare this movies with another Pixar's movies; however, that is almost unavoidable after you spent almost $35 on it.

I still recommend this movie for the whole family. I read earlier one review that this was not for kids, but my three year old daughter enjoys the movie.  There are some scenes that could be a little bit obscure, but are carefully balanced with funny moments and that you as a parent can take advantage in order to teach your kids not to be scared of, and face obstacles and not feel intimidated.",1242864000,2,1348,4.608333333333333
3388882,3,B00168OIIU,"I cant doubt it: this is one of the most must have movies that anyone could buy, even more on blu ray format. However the Question is: Whats Wrong Between Disney and Latin Fans? just simple to explain the question: Pinocchio for example, included the blu ray format movie and a digital copy on DVD. DVD had spanish language track, but Blu ray. Same for Sleeping Beauty. Also, the bonus features do include subtitles, and even games include spanish track. Taking the fact that bluy ray format was meant to be the same for Canada, USA and all latinamerica *and not DVD*, why disney is excluding Spanish Language Track, even when they did have the sources to include it on DVD? as far as i know, A Bug's Life won't include Spanish Language Track, just as they did for DVD before. I don`t think it is for business reasons, or to protect the latinamerica market. I just hope they include in this fantastic movie all the sources they can include, to make bluy ray disc ""A"" region, just what it was meant to be: A Global Choice for all the Americas.",1241481600,3,1042,4.460732984293194

A thorough list of extras and all of the blooper clips only added to the overall satisfaction.  I already owned the Cars BD, so I was pleased to add this movie as well.  The PQ is clearly a 5/5 even though the animation clearly shows this to be early in the Pixar lineup.  The AQ earns a hands-down 5/5 as well.  What little .1 present is primarily from the wings of the grasshoppers and the rhino-beetle ""Dim"", but it's rich and thunderous, not boomie.  All dialog was clear and supporting ambient sounds are present from the BD menu all the way to the end of the movie.

It is a story about an ant colony led by Flik (Dave Foley).  Flik seems to always cause trouble although he only means well.  They have grasshopper landlords it seems as they have to assemble food to feed them regularly 0 like a tax or payoff to the mob.  Flik seeks help from a buggy circus, which includes a spider, caterpillar, fleas, and other odd bugs.  He thinks they will scare the grasshoppers, but they realize this may not work.  Several schemes are hatched including a mock-up bird made of sticks and leaves.

It appeals equally well to both kids and adults. There's plenty of humor too. This is one of those discs that you should own if you have a blu-ray player.

3388929,5,B00168OIIU,"Back in 1998, Pixar Animation Studios and Disney released their second film.  Coming off the emotional high from ""TOY STORY"", Directors John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton began working on ""A BUG'S LIFE"" which cost around $45 million to make and brought in over $363 million worldwide.

The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews and featured an all star cast starring Dave Foley (""The Kids in the Hall"", ""NewsRadio"", etc.), Kevin Spacey (""The Usual Suspects"", ""Se7en"", ""L.A. Confidential""), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (""Seinfeld"", ""Saturday Night Live""), a young Hayden Panettiere (""HEROES""), comedians Denis Leary, Madeline Kahn, Phyllis Diller and Bonnie Hunt, Richard Kind (""Spin City"", ""Mad About You""), David Hyde Pearce (""Frazier""), Brad Garrett (""Everybody Loves Raymond"") and Roddy McDowell (""Planet of the Apes"", ""Cleopatra"") to name a few.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

When the first DVD came out for ""A BUG'S LIFE"" in 1999, it received rave reviews for being a complete digital transfer.  And of course, since the film's release in 1998, we have seen how Pixar animation has come to evolve in the last eleven years and pushing animation technology as far as they can go.

With that being said, ""A BUG'S LIFE"", even though its been a decade since its release, looks absolute magnificent on Blu-ray.  Feature in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:35:1, the animation looks absolute crystal clear.  The animation is quite vibrant in colors, lush and green for the grass, the browns of the dirt, the blues of the sky and the blacks are nice and deep.  There is nothing bad that can be said about the picture quality.  It's an animation that was created in digital and looks absolute awesome on Blu-ray.  No artifacts, no blemishes, no dust, bad particles or anything negative.  The picture quality is colorful, clear and vibrant!

As for audio, the audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and sounds absolutely superb.  The sound is literally coming from all directions and really good utilization of rear surrounds and separating audio.  I have a 7.2 setup and scenes such as the grasshoppers flying, to the sounds of thunder and a variety of sounds with music all coming together definitely makes an immersive, audio experience.

It's important to note that my receiver doesn't shown the DTS-HD Master Audio and shows up as ES.  There is speculation that the audio is featured not in 5.1 but in 6.1.

The special treatment that Walt Disney has put in their animated releases on Blu-ray have been nothing short of phenomenal, it doesn't matter if the film is 10 years or 70 years later, the picture and audio quality of these releases have been outstanding.  ""A BUG'S LIFE"" is yet another fabulous release on Blu-ray!

JUDGMENT CALL:

Also, included is a MovieCash Code with a printable voucher for the upcoming animated film ""Up"" and a second disc which is a digital copy of the film.

""A BUG'S LIFE"" is just a fantastic Blu-ray release.  I've always looked at the storyline is like a hilarious, enjoyable and child-friendly, animated nod to Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" but its overall storyline and presentation was just incredibly done.  The film was financially successful and it was quite interesting to see this film and DreamWorks Animation's ""ANTZ"" go head to head in the box office that year.

It's been a long time since I first seen ""A BUG'S LIFE"".  The first thing that catches your eye is how beautiful the film looks even though it is over a decade old but then once you start seeing the dirt and detail of an animated film created by Pixar at that time, you realized how much farther Pixar has come since 1998.

You can look at the characters now and just imagine if they looked this good then, can you imagine how much detail into the actual characters that Pixar would probably go crazy if they worked on a sequel (with a total of three films for ""TOY STORY"", with the success of this film, I was hoping a sequel for more adventures with Flik).

There is really nothing negative I can say about this release.  The 2003 DVD release was among the most fantastic Walt Disney animated releases ever as it really goes into the making of the film and for any Pixar fan or animator, this DVD was just magnificent to own.

What is awesome about ""A BUG'S LIFE"" and watching it ten years later is that the story is well-written and the acting is well-done.  It's one thing to have awesome animation but if the storyline is not enjoyable, then the experience is not exactly wonderful.  With this film,  you have a good group all-star talent involved in this film and the I found the acting to be well done.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus and her well-known laugh, Kevin Spacey's brooding vocals and of course, Dave Foley does a magnifcent job as Flik.  But the list goes on, these talents did such a fantastic job on this film.  It's also important to note that if you are big fans of legendary talents Madeline Kahn and Roddy McDowall, this animated film was their final film.

Now let's assume that you own the original 1999 or the 2003 DVD version and are wondering if you should double dip and re-purchase this film on Blu-ray.  My answer is YES!!!

This is the definitive version to own of ""A BUG'S LIFE"" as the picture and audio quality is just phenomenal in High Definition.  I can continue to give you many reasons of how awesome the picture and audio quality are and how incredible this film is, but you also get more special features included only on this Blu-ray release.  Moreso, than the 2003 DVD edition and these newer bonus features are presented in HD.  The overall presentation of this release alone outshines the 2003 DVD (and that DVD release was magnificent).  If you own an HD setup, you're definitely going to appreciate this release!

Overall, ""A BUG'S LIFE"" is highly recommended! A+!",1243641600,3,8928,4.918120805369128

Following the commercial success of Toy Story, Pixar's first outing into cinema, comes ""A Bug's Life."" This film, though not as charming as Toy Story, is still wonderfully crafted by the geniuses behind the scenes. The story follows the adventure of Flik, an ant inventor, who seems to find himself in trouble more often than not. After a series of events, all of the food that the ants collect as an offering to a band of grasshoppers that harrass their colony is gone, dropped into the water surrounding the island that the colony is on. Poor Flik is to blame. Quickly after a meeting between the Ant Queen, Princess Ada, and the advisors of the colony, Flik is sent out to find some warrior bugs to fight off the grasshoppers. What ensues is a hilarous misunderstanding, that leads to your typical confrontation of good vs evil. The pace of the movie is great, and the visuals (per 1999) are amazing. John Lasseter knows how to treat his audience, and we get what we want to see, the perspective of the world from a bug's view. Taking story elements from ""Seven Samurai,"" the film is about standing up for what is right, even if confronted with insanely big obstacles. The voice actors, specially Kevin Spacey as Hopper, seem to have a blast, giving an extra amount of charisma to the film. The main reason why this movie is a success is because, like all Pixar films, it has a heart, and it always will.

The Blu-Ray:
Video:
WOW! I have to give Kudos to Disney. They have yet failed to impress me with any of their Blu-Ray releases. There is not a blemish or artifact to be found. Straight from the digital transfer, the colors are perfectly balanced and varied, while blacks are as deep as they can be. This is a pristine transfer, with no imperfections what-so-ever.
5 out of 5.

Audio:
I was very impressed by the video, but I was blown away by the DTS-HD MA mix on this Blu-Ray. MY GOODNESS! I never thought I would say this, but this is the perfect mix. It even tops Wall-E (IMO) in every aspect. Surround use is constant and directionality is like no other. The perfect demo scene would be when the rains begins. The bass of the drops, the clarity of the screams, it all weaves together to form an audio experience like no other. Just perfect!
5 out of 5.

Overall, this is a wonderful Blu-Ray. Great, fun movie, with a wonderful transfer, and an audio mix that is demo-worthy. My hat goes off to Disney.",1243468800,,2437,4.47191011235955

3388932,5,B00168OIIU,"I know A Bugs Life probably isn't the highest rated Pixar film around, but I really like it. I had this on preorder for quite a while and finally got it in this week.

We got a chance to sit down and watch it last night and it looks ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! The detail and the color is so perfect. You could see every little pebble in the ant hill. I saw detail that I would have never even thought should be there before.

Pixar makes some good quality movies and after viewing this, I'm very much looking forward to buying many more Pixar films on Blu-Ray.",1242864000,2,553,4.2075471698113205
3388933,4,B00168OIIU,"My review is for the Blu-Ray version of ""A Bug's Life"". I will not over the plot since there are multiple reviews about it.
VIDEO:
The graphics are awesome, especially the landscapes and the overall environment. However, I was slightly disappointed with the graphics of the ants and some of the insects that looked poorly rendered CGI material, which sorely stands out in Blu-Ray version. Yes, I still have in mind that the movie was made in 1999 and was Pixar's second movie.
AUDIO
The audio was awesome. Lossless audio makes a difference here, especially when the grasshoppers leave the cantina at the dessert. It is just fantastic

Overall, I enjoyed the movie. I am true fan of Pixar's movie (I have all the releases in BD). Maybe this movie is not at the same level of other great titles like Ratatouille. I know we should not compare this movies with another Pixar's movies; however, that is almost unavoidable after you spent almost $35 on it.

I still recommend this movie for the whole family. I read earlier one review that this was not for kids, but my three year old daughter enjoys the movie.  There are some scenes that could be a little bit obscure, but are carefully balanced with funny moments and that you as a parent can take advantage in order to teach your kids not to be scared of, and face obstacles and not feel intimidated.",1242864000,2,1348,4.608333333333333
