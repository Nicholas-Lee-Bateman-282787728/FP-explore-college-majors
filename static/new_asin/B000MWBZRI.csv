8173210,4,B000MWBZRI,"In the late sixties, John Harris captures the flavors of the past hidden in
the last sardine cannery to remain open through the eyes of two aging cannery workers who once knew the famous owner, Knut Hovden-- through an aging piano player in a house of ill repute haunted by a ghost-- and through the eyes of some runaway hippies and dance mimes who choose to live in the once prosperous (and oderous) fish packing house only to see it burn down after a few months. Artful, well photographed, it makes you wish the film could be so much longer.",1223337600,,543,4.44
