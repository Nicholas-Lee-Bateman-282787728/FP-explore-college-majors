993199,5,6305235120,"As a fan of the OUATIC series, I'm gonna say that Pt2 is my personal favorite, from the storyline to the soundtrack- EX martial arts display put on by Jet Li, with choreography by Yuen Wo Ping & fantastical direction by Tsui Hark. As good as Jet is, he's practically upstaged by Donnie Yen, firmly rooted in character as an imperial loyalist yet the villainous antagonist to Jet Li's Wong Fei Hong! Yen practically steals every scene he's in! Rosamond Kwan & Max Mok round out the main cast, providing ample mix of comedy & drama that balances the film.
A word of WARNING however: do N-O-T buy the ""SONY Pictures/Classic"" release!!!
You would B better off getting an HK import version, instead!!!
My own copy is the ""Tai Seng"" DVD release.
The difference between the two?
The ""SONY"" copy runs at a S-L-O-W-E-R pace, listed & clocked at 113 mins.
The import(Tai Seng)copy runs 108 mins but both R the SAME versions, scene-for-scene!
Thus, the latter's speed plays GREAT, in conjunction with the action! The SONY is DISappointing.
Also, the same can be said for the ""SONY"" versions of OUATIC 1 & 3!
So AVOID the SONY's, get the HK Import (Tai Sing, for ex)copies instead!",1368748800,,1169,4.6521739130434785

993201,5,6305235120,"Jet Li returns to the role of early 20th-century pugilist and healer, Wong Fei Hung, which elevated Li from some dude who's done a few sweet fu flicks to a household name in China.  This is a sequel that, in my opinion, is better than the original, though I will not say that it's a better movie.  They cut down on the length and dubious humor, swapped Yuen Biao for Max Mok, and replaced the 3 fight choreographers with Yuen Woo Ping.

This finds Master Wong heading to Canton with his disciple Foon (Mok) and Aunt Yee (Rosamund Kwan, ""Project A II"") for a medical conference to demonstrate to westerners the Chinese art of acupuncture.  While there, the city is going ape as the White Lotus Clan is attacking all things foreign and everything is on the brink of chaos.  As China's fate has yet to be determined, Master Wong meets Dr. Sun Yat Sen (Zhang Tielin, ""Hero""), also an attendee of the conference, who has a list of China's revolutionaries that the government desperately wants.  Add to that the ever-blossoming romance between Wong and Yee (his aunt by marriage) and you've got yourself a flick!

I cannot say this movie is perfect but I can't think of too many things that would've made it better.  It's a great mix of story and fights.  The wires are used a little too much but this is far from the wire-zeal that Yuen Woo Ping would indulge in many other films.  Where this really excels is the use of Donnie Yen (""Flashpoint"") as a Qing general after Sun Yat Sen.  He and Li have two must-see fights with deadly bed sheets!  I also have to laugh a little at the film's climax:  Did Woo Ping choreograph ANY movie from the 90s that DIDN'T have the final fight take place atop some sort of pyramid-like structure?!?  ""Iron Monkey"" almost passes!

As with the other 2 parts of 1-3 this version from Columbia/Tristar is terrific!  Remastered picture and audio, with languages available in Cantonese and Mandarin and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.  As with the others, the English dub is available as a special feature.  Eh, so long as it's there.  This is a good film all around and though based on many real people, is fictitious.  One can watch great fights and learn a little about Chinese culture and history, therefore making it HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Notes:  the White Lotus Chief is played by Xiong Xin Xin (rarely does director Tsui Hark make a flick without him), who would go on to play the awesome Clubfoot in the rest of the sequels.  I also think that R. Lee Ermey dubbed his voice in this, though that is merely an assumption.

From the star of ""Romeo Must die"" and ""Kiss of the Dragon"". Jet li is back as irrepressible folk-hero and martial arts master Wong Fei-Chung in the no 1 Hong Kong Box Office smash hit ""Upon upon a Time in China 2"". Fearuring a tense, atmospheric story which centers on Cantion and the  destructive power struggle between the official government, the emerging democtacy movement and the rabidly xenophobic White Lotus Cult, this movie entered the record books as the 100th movie to depict the life of legendary hero Wong Fei Hung, making the serties the longest running in movie-making hisrory. This movie has everything which made its predecessor such a success: a dynamic, incorruptible hero brought brilliantly to life by Jet Li, a supremely talented supporting cast, beautifully conceived sets, stylish cinematography and breath-taking fight sequences.",1257206400,,969,5.251612903225807
993203,5,6305235120,"The first couple of times I watched this movie, I did not know who Donnie Yen was.  After watching Iron Monkey, Killzone, and Seven Swords, I wanted to see more of his movies.  Looking on amazon, I could not believe he was in ""Once Upon a Time in China II."" How did I miss him ?  I already loved this movie, and now knowing Donnie Yen is in it, makes it even better!
The story for II, is Wong Fei-Hung(Jet Li), Aunt 13(Rosamund Kwan), and Foon go to Canton for a medical conference so Wong can display his acupuncture skills.  While there, Wong runs up against the White Lotus Society, who hate all foreignors!  As Wong battles against the White Lotus, he also eventually meets the local General(Donnie Yen).  Their first martial arts scene with stick-fighting is awesome!  As you can probably guess, Jet and Donnie are two of my favorite martial artists! Wong eventually saves some schoolchildren, and they all arrive at the English Embassy, where the White Lotus society wages war.  After fighting off the Society, he goes to their shrine to battle the Immortal,Invincible Kung!  Another great battle ensues, with Wong triumphant.  As Wong and Foon attempt to meet with the ""rebellion"" at the docks, General Len comes to stop them.  The final battle between Jet and Donnie is fantastic!!!  I can't believe I did not know who he was the first time!
I liked the further subplot of the interaction between Wong, Foon, and Aunt 13.  Wong is always yelling at Foon, especially when Wong seems to catch him touching or holding Aunt 13.  Foon is in love with Aunt 13, while she obviously is infatuated with Wong.
The DVD picture is very good.  And the sound is also very good.
The Extra's on the DVD are a bit thin.
* There is the original theatrical movie, and then an English Dubbed Version.
* There are 4 trailers
* There are filmographies of director Tsui Hark, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, and Rosamond Kwan.

The action sequences of this film out do and are better than what we see in the original film. This movie also leaves behind the realism and goes more towards a fictional story, it even says that a lot of the film is fictional at the beginning.

993230,5,6305235120,"This movie is the center master piece of all martial art movies, very and I mean very remarkable scenes, fights between Donny Yen and Jet Li and the cult master. It speaks a little humor that works better than the first movie, Tsu Hark has very apparently found the correct ""style"" to deliver this movie, this action package remains one of the top action thriller of all time in my mind. I found the idea of Donnie's role using wet twisted cloth as weapon is very intriguing, but yet when he was beaten by Jei Li using a broken bamboo to slice it apart is even more interesting. The thing is the weapon is created without intention in mind and the creative deadly idea was make right at the moment when Jei Li's almost got strangle to death by the wet cloth, the idea is just tricky but works remarkably. It tells u in a sense that the most powerful weapon at the end can be a simple creative mind that trigger just in a matter of second. I like that fight a lot. And the romance between Jet Li and his aunt in this confusing family branching thing has much thrill too, basically the girl is Jet Li's Aunt but they dun directly blooded each other as their accestors only linked to each other may be 5 or 6 generations back, but in  each traditional chinese family they always bring along their whole family branch record so if it happens u found somebody's grand 10X generations ago was once in the branch he might go easy on u if hes richer. with this sense in mind, so when Jet Li propose to the girl its consider very outrages as even shes a lot younger than Jet Li but she s a senior of his and even they dun even have teh same last name but they do come from the same family. But then they are gonna get marry.. the whole damn thing is both amusing and confusing.",1107302400,3,1768,4.215339233038348
993231,4,6305235120,"Wong Fei Hung is an important figure, not only to Chinese history, but also to me as a student of the style, which he helped make famous. The Hung Gar Style is traced back to Hung Tsi Kwan (there are lots of debates over the spelling of his name) who taught Luk Ah Choy, and Wong Tai (Wong Fei Hung's grand father) who taught Wong Kei Ying (Fei Hung's father) who refused to teach Fei Hung, forcing him to turn to Luk Ah Choy for lessons. Fei Hung then went on to teach Lam Sai Wing who wrote the book that more or less made the style famous. Hung Gar is a very common style in Southern China, but is very rare stateside with only a small number of schools teaching it. Wong Fei Hung is therefore a matter of great interest to me, which is why I bought this film without actually seeing it first. Lucky for me it ended up being a very worthwhile purchase.
 Although the film continues the bizarre and fictional relationship between Wong Fei Hung and his Cousin Yee this film is the most enjoyable of the three that I have seen. There is a lot of comedy in this film that works brilliantly along side the action and the drama for this film, which fully recognizes itself as being a work of fiction despite its use of historical figures.
 Wong Fei Hung and his student Foon (Now played by a different actor) set off on an adventure with Cousin Yee that bring them up against the Sinister White Lotus Society who are determined to rid China of the foreigners using a mystical power that makes them invincible. But is this power real? The film's story is more intriguing than the previous film, and the action scenes are twice as good. I highly recommend this title as it, like its predecessor is one of the finest Kung Fu films out there. Even the English dub on this film is halfway decent!",1086048000,4,1788,4.318452380952381
993232,4,6305235120,"I picked this one up as I heard that it's the best movie in the series, as well as one of Jet Li's best movies in general; that statement is really only half right.  It is most likely the best in the series, essentially due to the intricate fight scenes choreographed by none other than ""The Man"" Yuen Woo Ping.  Unfortunately, all of the movies in this series suffer in the same manner as the build-up to the fights is rather boring and extensive; i.e. the stories are nothing to write home about.  In actuality, my favorite movie with Jet Li depicting Wong Fei Hung would be ""Last Hero in China"", which is officially not even a part of the OUATIC series.  Watch this flick for Donnie Yen; if you want to see more entertaining work by Jet Li check out ""Fist of Legend"" or ""Kung fu Cult Master"".",1037664000,2,795,4.315436241610739
993233,5,6305235120,"I reckon this is the best of the trilogy. Decent plot, good acting (Rosamund Kwan a very cute actress too). And you can hardly find a fighting scene as well choreographed as the one between Jet Li and Donnie Yen, both being ""real"" masters from Shaolin. When it comes to Kung-fu in the post-Bruce-Lee era, only the well-trained techniques of Li and Yen can really take your breath away (unless you prefer Jackie Chan's acrobatic moves and funny stuff, that is). Jet Li goes on scoring big with ""Kiss of the Dragon"", but I don't think he is cut out for the double role in ""The One"". So far my top five martial arts films are: ""Fist of Fury"" (Bruce Lee), ""Iron Monkey"" (Donnie Yen), ""Wing Chun"" (Michelle Yeoh), ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and ""New Legend of Shaolin"" (Jet Li).",1022284800,3,774,4.457746478873239
993234,5,6305235120,"In the second film in this series, martial arts film legend Jet Li stars as Dr. Wong Fei-Hung, a real life folk hero of 19th century China.  Combining solid martial arts action (as you'd expect from a Jet Li movie) with an equally solid storyline which delves into actual historical elements, this movie is a winner all-around, thus justifying the Hong Kong Film Award that it received.
THE STORY:
It is 19th century China and Western influence is growing in China bringing with it both good and bad elements.  Dr. Wong Fei-Hung, a noted martial arts instructor and doctor, as well as his countrymen must contend with the expanding influence of the West and its impact on Chinese society.  The country is in turmoil.  An anti-Western extremist reactionary cult, the White Lotus Society, has arisen with a maniacal following bent on destroying all things Western, including Chinese who have begun to adopt Western ways.  It is up to Wong Fei-Hung and his loyal followers, his loving ""Aunt"" Yee and his student Foon, to stop the ruthless destruction of the White Lotus.  In addition, the film delves into history further as Wong and his companions meet and aide Dr. Sun Yat Sen, the famous Chinese revolutionary.  There are tons of battles as the White Lotus, The Chinese Government, the British forces and Dr. Sun Yat Sen's revolutionaries all battle against each other, with Wong Fei-Hung and his followers all caught in the middle...
THE COOL STUFF:
If you love martial arts action you've got TONS of it here.  The fight scenes are NUMEROUS and ELABORATE as you'll be treated to tons of fighting set in 19th century China is tons of marketplace settings as well as vintage Chinese dwellings and buildings.  The sets and costumes are just awesome.  The fight scenes between Wong and the White Lotus are just awesome.  In addition, though the storyline is serious, unlike in the first film, this film does incorporate some humorous moments into it courtesy of the Westernized Aunt Yee and her interactions with Wong and Koon which lead to some hilarious moments (on the train ride as well as the dinner scene with the dog).  Another hilarious scene is the acupuncture seminar that Wong and Koon attend with Sun Yat Sen and the Western doctors.
THE DVD FEATURES:
The features of the DVD, while not extensive as most new DVDs are, are perfectly acceptable.  Included on this DVD are the following:
1. Bonus Movie Trailers for the following:
a. Once Upon a Time in China II
b. Once Upon a Time in China Trilogy
c. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
d. Miracles by Jackie Chan
2. Filmographies for Director Tsui Hark, Jet Li and Rosamund Kwan, Donnie Yen
THE VERDICT:
The most common criticism for most martial arts/action flicks are that the stories [disappoint]. The redeeming quality for them is, of course, the action.  Like its predecessor, Once Upon a Time in China II overcomes 8these criticisms by delivering solid action and (lo and behold) a GREAT story.  In addition, the film, besides having an awesome story and action sequences also incorporates just the right amount of humor to make it a nice package all around.
Overall, besides oohing and aahing to tremendous fight scenes you'll also be treated to a great look at a crucial period in Chinese history.

993286,3,6305235120,"Long story short: if you want to see a movie heavy on plot, (complicated as it is) OUATIC 2 is for you. However, if you want to see a movie which showcases both Jet Li and Donnie Yen's incredible martial arts skills, you'll have to look somewhere else as those skills are used very sparingly, in fact they're buried so deeply in the movie amid all the plot you almost have to ask yourself why they were included in the first place.
'Fist of Legend' and 'The Tai Chi Master', among many others, are Jet Li's best which exibit his tremendous physical talents. 'Drunken Tai Chi' and 'Iron Monkey' are a must see for both fans and those who are unfamiliar with Donnie Yen, an established actor and martial artist who'll soon make his mark just like Jackie Chan and Jet Li.",1008547200,,768,4.415492957746479

Not only are they very clear in their message and morals (something Hollywood has lost through attempting to be sophisticated) but they are beautiful to look at, with every scene gently enclosing you in its magic. No ""look at this"" shots, or endless, yawning gaps in the action.
I'm a recent convert, and therefore unskilled in my appreciation, but I found the movie more accessible than the first one, as no doubt it was meant to be. The style of amiable, innocent comedy and the great characters make it very enjoyable. This second movie is surely different enough to have a different title, but I do like the impatient, production-line nature of it all.

The best Kungfu movies never emphasis on violence and this moive is indeed a good example. There are many good fighting scenes which well reflect the characters and are beautifully choreographed. I am especially fond of the fighting scene between Wong Fei Hong and the offical, in which when Wong Fei Hong went to ask the offical to give refuge to the children, the official raided him aggressively and they fighted with staffs. The sentiments from both sides, villainy and righteousness, are poetically presented though their movement. So much better than those meaningless violent fightings.
OUATIC I and II are truely great movies, while the rest of the series, though pleasant to watch, are not as good. The movie shows the best of Jet Li along with fist of legend. Pity he acted in some really lousy movies too, especially some (all) of those he made in Hollywood.",999993600,5,1145,4.73

Li is Wong Fei Hong, a renowned matial artist, this time around traveling with his companions when he becomes entangled with a revolutionary group called the White Lotus Sect.  They are calling for the expulsion of all foreigners from China.  This leads some to fantastic fight sequences which certainly lived up to the first film.

The storyline is also a very interesting continuation from 1; while in 1 we saw the western influence and exploitation seeping into turn of the century China, here we glimpse the other side of the coin, non-exploitative foreigners being persecuted by patriotic groups.

...actually I could go on-and-on about this movie, but I'll try to stick to the essentials. Personally, I think this one's the best of all the other OUATIC sequels. Yes, they're all excellent films, but what makes this outstand; well it has two of the most gifted martial artists of all time.
I still get goose-bumps everytime I watch the dramatic scene where General Lan (Donnie Yen), is shown in an eerie-evening setting, and demonstrates his amazing skill and grace using a wet cloth-stick. Its an exquisite visual with glowing lanterns hanging everywhere...and then the scene explodes into a fierce and thrilling all-out battle with Wong Fei Hung (Jet Li) using bamboo sticks.

Of course the entire film is done equally impressive; a powerful story about the political turmoils of China. Here, Wong Fei Hung is caught in the choas while visiting Canton for a medical conference. Although the scripts are brief and simple, the story in itself is very dramatic with much credit to the stunning cast performaces.

I  just love the crazy tables fight between Jet and the white lotus sect and I  have no clue how they thought up that fight scene! And having Jet Li fight  against the great Donnie Yen was even more of a plus in the movie! My only  regret is I wish Jet and Donnie would have fought hand to hand which would  have probably went down as one of the greatest one on one fights in  history.

But what added a great sense of  suspense to the movie was the White Lotus cult,these guys are nuts,if you  see the first scene then youll know what I mean,especailly when the two  guys eat the sticks on fire(close up and all) and their priest deflects  sword attacks and gets kicked in the nuts  viciously by his students to  demonstrate invincibility(but of course not to Wong Fei Hung).There was  also alot of violence and the cults songs are almost hypnotizing  ,especially the blind man's,I CANT GET THEM OUT OF MY HEAD!YOU MUST OWN  THIS MOVIE KUNGFU FAN OR NOT.",955152000,9,896,4.643312101910828

993360,5,6305235120,"The sequal to the hit Once Upon A Time in China takes off with Wong Master (Jet Li) taking a vacation with a couple of his best students.  Right form the beginning of the movie Wong Master's martial art prowess is displayed.  In this beginning scene he encounters a ""White Lotus"" sect whose  aggressive ways in dealing with foreign affairs lead to too much killing.  The fight that is created between Wong (Jet Li) and the White Lotus sect  displays an internal fight with one's own countrymen.  The fight scenes in  this sequal are original and high intensity.  A very imortant message slips  through all the perfectly coreographed action scenes.  Even the opposition  may be evil and underhanded, violence is only a short-term solution.  A  nice touch to the movie is the romantic stirring between Wong Master and  very distant Aunt with no blood relation.  It's not as sick as it sounds...  Definitely a must have.",947635200,8,917,4.782051282051282

993362,3,6305235120,"This movie was better than the first one. the final fight with the ""White Lotus"" society was pretty good.
 But what made this a classic and a must see for HK Kung Fu fans are the 2 fight scenes between  Donny Yuen and Jet li. The Shaolin Stick vs towl fight scene in the middle  between Donny and Jet was thrilling to watch. The final fight scene was the  bomb, with Donny using a ridiculous sheet of towl again as a weapon.",930009600,3,424,4.134146341463414
