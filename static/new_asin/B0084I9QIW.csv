5130650,5,B0084I9QIW,I was able to see Michael Jackson here in Indianapolis in March 1988 both shows were sold out. He was amazing!!! The show was over 2 and half hours long. I've never seen a concert of his only being an hour long. I hope that's a misprint. I'm very excited that this is finally coming out!!!,1343865600,13,289,4.178571428571429
5130651,3,B0084I9QIW,"It says it is the complete show, but it only runs 60 minutes?  Can this be correct?  Was this just a one-off special performance, or an actual BAD Tour show?  60 minutes seems quite short to me.",1342915200,5,194,4.1891891891891895
5130652,4,B0084I9QIW,What about a blu-ray version of this special concert? DVD is (almost) dead! Michael himself would have wanted the best ...,1342137600,11,122,4.857142857142857

5130658,5,B0084I9QIW,"If you are a fan of Michael Jackson, if you love to see someone master their craft, If you like and love to see talent, and really hear someone sing without a track playing in the back round. Then this is a must have DVD. Some commented on the quality. It is good, but if you compare it to how DVD's look when they are recorded in digital format. Then some may complain. But the video is still good quality since it was not digitally enhanced.",1510358400,,443,4.162790697674419

5130667,5,B0084I9QIW,This video captures the genius of MJ. It's a riveting performance showing the talent and detail that characterized his work. You're left to wonder what would he be doing today if he were still with us. RIP Michael!,1501459200,,214,4.657894736842105
5130668,5,B0084I9QIW,"This is by far the best tour in the career of Michael Jackson. I don't make this statement solely on the songs (although I think that it takes into account the three-best albums in his career), but I like to focus on his dancing moves/coreographed routine. The style and routine incorporated is the most diversed of his entire career. His common dance routines to his most popular songs are present (his Billy Jean routine is the best he ever did for that song) but you can also note the R&B/Soul moves that flash out every other beat (James Brown's shimmies and groove). This is by far the most diverse era of MJ as far as musical style and dance (Rock&Roll, Pop, Disco, R&B/Soul, Metal). I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn who MJ truly was and wants a good starting point. RIP GOAT",1499040000,3,805,4.482993197278912
5130669,4,B0084I9QIW,"I enjoy this DVD of Michael Jackson's Live performance at Wembley Stadium!!! Great songs, and still is the King of Pop!

5130683,2,B0084I9QIW,I LOVE LOVE LOVE MICHAEL JACKSON.  Needless to say I am very disappointed with the quality of this DVD.  I wasn't expecting blu Ray quality but it looks like a crappie VHS version.  The screen/picture isn't clear for half of the show.  Anytime it's a wide shot and not a close up on Michael the picture is slightly blurry.  The sound is pretty good.  I was so excited to see this concert having had seen and purchased the Dangerous tour and DVD I was expecting just as good quality but alas heavily disappointed. If i had known the picture was going to look like this I may have kept searching or just waited till a blu ray version came out.  But I still love me some MJ,1473206400,,670,4.228346456692913

MJ's performance is outstanding but it seems SONY wanted to make a quick buck . If you want to see quality videos of this concert, check youtube.

5130710,5,B0084I9QIW,"the quality of this recording can't compare with some of the more recent innovations in digitalization/HD etc. that said, if you're really into Michael Jackson, then do what my kiddos do - crank this up, move the coffee table out of the living room and dance like nobody's watching.  Because if you're this close to the King of Pop, you can only bow down to his greatness.  Who cares if you can see each of his pores? If you're dancing like my little guy, you wouldn't have time to see them anyway :)",1451606400,,500,4.365591397849462

5130712,5,B0084I9QIW,"I was only 6 years old when MJ went on this Bad World Tour, so this is truly amazing that they were able to restore and capture this incredible treasure!! I grew up as a child of the 80's, so MJ has always been a fave of mine. Please keep in mind that this entire concert came from the only VHS tapes that MJ had in his personal collection, so it's not in high definition, which in my humble opinion does not by any means make it less amazing. You can tell that he pours his entire heart and soul into every single song, and how can you not enjoy singing along while watching all of that fancy footwork?! Having said that, it's an incredible piece of history, being that this would be his first solo World Tour and his one and only American Solo Tour. This particular performance was one of 7 that he performed in London, and Prince Charles and Princess Diana attended this concert. The sound is fabulous and as much as I so wish I had been able to see one of MJ's incredible concerts, watching this DVD makes me feel as if I am in the front row, and there are not too many shots of the crowd during the performance. There was a booklet included that lists all of his tour dates/locations and includes some wonderful photos of MJ.  I highly recommend this to everyone as it came in perfect condition and the shipping was super fast!!",1450915200,,1333,4.2687747035573125

5130718,5,B0084I9QIW,"I barely watched the concert, and I can give you a full blown review on it. Michael Jackson was extraordinary as always. The DVD resolution wasn't the best or the worst either...Sony was probably too lazy and money hungry to remaster the visuals, but I know for a fact the sound is restored, and multithreaded. Also there isn't those annoying crowd angles every 20 secs to show how they fainted (I mean c'mon camera guy). The visuals shouldn't be a problem (unless you have a big HDTV, and even then as long as you aren't insanely close to the tv it should be fine), and if you have a widescreen tv just go to display size/picture size, and put complete (or whichever looks best). Oh and I almost forgot to tell you about the 5.1 surround sound (when main menu comes out click on audio and you'll see it). They didn't perform ""the way you make me feel"", but on special features they have the footage of him performing it from the night before (also it's in a slightly lower quality). They also have ""I just can't stop loving you"", and ""Bad"" from yokohama which I think is really cool. The packaging is superb, but when you open it up you'll see the disk inside a cardboard pocket so be carefull when taking it out, and it also comes with a booklet containing all the tour dates with pictures which I think is really cool also. To those of you who are struggling with buying this or ""Dangerous tour live at Bucharest"" i'd say get wembley if you want to see mike at his best (at Bucharest you can hear him fully worn out in the 3rd song :'( ). But if you want better special effects, and dancing get live at Bucharest. Overall i'd give this a 5 star rating because I think this is a MUST HAVE for any Michael Jackson fan.",1448323200,,1719,4.308641975308642

And then he topped it off at the end with the little girl hugging him and him bringing out all those children who did such a great job trying to imitate his dances.

5130741,5,B0084I9QIW,"this concert was so good that it  literally brought tears to my eyes while watching it. it was tears of appreciation for the intensity of his performance. he gives 150 percent. the energy he has to continue to sing and dance song after song with no rest is remarkable. I appreciate that that camera is kept on him 99% of the time and does not alternates between him the audience every 15 seconds like todays modern concerts dvds. the quality is not dvd hd but more vcr tape quality transferred to dvd. the quality was better when I watched it on my 20"" tube tv than my 42"" widescreen but nevertheless still watchable. this is better than the Budapest concert thought I like the Billie Jean performance on the Budapest concert better. This is a must have for every MJ fan, casual or fanatical.

I watch this at least once a day, and sit awe struck wondering how he can perform one song after another so perfectly. Also have the Dangerous Tour-Bucharest which is fantastic. However, there's something about this Live At Wembley concert that is truly magical. He is mesmerizing. I cannot take my eyes off him. (Nearly passed out with that ending of ""Rock With You"") To me, everyone else looks totally 80's, but MJ's look is timeless - as always. Michael Jackson is absolutely incomparable, unparalleled.

5130789,5,B0084I9QIW,"Michael, your talent knows no limits. I think the only category of music I never heard from you was country, but you could conquer that genre, too. Aside from YouTube clips, this was my first experience watching seeing MJ performed, showing why so many people would be so willing to stand for 2 hours or more just to catch him work his mojo. It is just simply an amazing feat to behold, and sadly makes me regret for taking his talent for granted. Not that many of us would have thought of it in that way, but for me, I liken it to my years living in Charlotte, during Jordan's return from his 1st retirement. As big of a Jordan fan I was, it NEVER once occurred to me to buy a ticket to see the Bulls play the Hornets. And for months now, I have been going through a Renaissance with Michael's music, both with his brothers and on his own. Live at Wembley is a masterpiece, and one that you most definitely need to add to your collection. Dirty Diana, this dude chose to do a rock song, and literally ROCKED IT!!!!! I used to think when I saw grown men crying at the sight of him, these dudes are punks. Well, I digress from that position because I am not too sure I would not have the same emotions: crying, snotting and everything. He has said that he writes 100 songs or more before dwindling those down to 20 to 30 that he wants to release to the public.  I am now able to discern quite of bit of what his lyrics mean, and as gentle of a soul as he IS, if you think he is done, especially for those who put him in their crosshairs with slander, keep watching. Even if the King of Pop is gone, Michael Jackson is not.",1413590400,,1621,4.129746835443038

Sound quality is surprisingly good for 1988;  I prefer this audio over the Live in Bucharest DANGEROUS tour DVD.  Obviously video quality isn't stellar, but read the description; the video was ripped from the only known 25-year old VHS copy of the show from Michael's personal collection.  Gets the job done anyway.  I like the fact that the cameras focus on Jackson the whole time as opposed to showing the sweaty, crying concertgoers.  I would rather see MJ, thank you very much.

The 3rd song is ""The way you make me feel"", which is not in the concert footage. He added that song later in the tour. If you love MJ, you will absolutely love this DVD.

I have wanted this for so long, and never imagined it would come out on DVD. This is truly, My King at his PRIME. If you love Michael, and truly get moved within your SOUL by his music. YOU WILL love this and MUST own it. Now let me say, the quality of this for being so old from 1988 is very very good. Now it's not going to be as bright and bold as today's dvd's because back then cameras and lighting were different. I just wanted to put that out there, THIS TAKES NOTHING AWAY FROM THE QUALITY OF DVD.

It is fantastic and songs like I just can't stop loving you with the beautiful blonde back up singer of his is pure gold. It's clear in that performance from this dvd when he touches her leg and the way she grabs his arm, and in the one from the Bad Tokyo tour that they had some kind of chemistry. You could see it when they look at each other. Dirty Diana is simply divine here. His performance with his guitarist Jennifer Batten is amazing. She touches him as she walks by at one point and it's just electric. His members of his band truly loved him.

This DVD is priceless and is beyond a great deal for what you are paying, you would expect something this rare to be $80 at least. But let me say, with the 3 bonus performances on the disk you can't go wrong. This is for any real raw Michael fan.

I have owned a VERY bad copy of this which was recorded from TV back in 1988 I guess and deteriorated over the yrs...it is just wonderful to have this footage in mint condition from Michaels personal videographers! Another gem for any Michael Jackson fan!,1363996800,,283,4.68
5130867,5,B0084I9QIW,"So, in 1988 I was 7 years old and completely in love with Michael Jackson. I even showed the movie Moonwalker at my birthday party. Why oh why didn't my parents take me to see him in concert? There were so many opportunities: Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Indianapolis. Did they not realize that this would be his only US tour ever??? Did they not know that this was history in the making and probably one of the greatest entertainers who ever lived? It's not like I could have ordered tickets and taken myself. Poor me.

And then 25 years I discovered this wonderful dvd here on amazon. This dvd does not disappoint. It takes me right back to 1988 when the 80's were awesome and I had not a care in the world. Michael has his long Jheri Curl with the little baby hairs and the band has no shortage of mohawks to go around. Now for those of you who criticize the video quality, I have to say that it actually inhanced the experience for me. Obviously this was recorded in the 80's before all of the technology advancements we have today so you must take that in consideration. I also find it quite amusing to watch their attempts at making stage theatrics and pyrotechnics to thrill the crowd. Of course it pails in comparison to what we have today, and may even seem a bit rudimentary, but to me it is a documentation of history. Michael was a perfectionist so for the time period whatever was strategically placed in the show was painstakenly reviewed by Michael and his creative team. Even by today's standards it is still a fantastic, marvelous show. His talent is timeless and for that reason alone this concert stands the test of time. I really appreciated it's VHS quality. Call me a sucker for nostalgia.

All of the songs performed are great. I do have one criticism, however. Why oh why did he hire Sheryl Crow as a back-up singer? I love her music as a solo artist but until I heard her live singing on this dvd, now I must question her ability as a singer. She sounds like a strangled cat. She butchered one of my favorite songs. By now I'm sure you have seen the movie ""This is It"", well the beautiful young lady he hired to sing this song for his This is it tour blows Sheryl Crow out of the freakin' water. I don't know what the heck Mike was thinking. Maybe he was infatuated with her high heels, leather mini skirt and sky high eighties hair lol. Speaking of Sheryl, when they are singing together on ""I just can't stop loving you"", the sexy way Mike touches her and is in tune with her body. Whoa! I didn't know Mike had it in him. I mean, I've seen all his videos but those all seemed so choreographed. If this video is any indication, Mike sure knew how to touch a woman in all the right places.

Best video ever. I am so happy I have these memories to remember this special man forever. He was genius and now his legacy with live on through his music and the collection of film that we have. Bravo. Bravo.",1363737600,2,2923,4.340036563071298

5130875,5,B0084I9QIW,"This was an excellent DVD... watching Michael Jackson in action on his most successful tour ever, the Bad tour.  He truly comes alive on stage, but more so with this performance because he knew Princess Diana, who he greatly admired, was there watching.

I LOVED the close ups, which you don't see often on YouTube videos of his other tours and concerts.  He was magical, full of energy and incredible talent... and there is NO ONE today who can match him.  This was his desire, to be the best, and so he was and always will be.

I only wish that more in the media would acknowledge that fact.  They seem to ignore all the accolades from Michael's artist/musician colleagues and friends that are heaped upon him.  He was more than just an artist, seen more as a prophet for influencing our generation and the next.  Michael has left an incredible legacy, that young children are only now learning about, and so his light will shine on.  Long live the King.",1360713600,2,956,4.543859649122807

Having had the Yokohama concert, Dangerous, and History shows already, it is great to have this classic now, finally.  Whats great is that if you've seen the later concerts, you can see how Michael continually worked to improve the stage show and performance...always coming bigger and better.  And Michael was probably one of the only artist who, through short films and such, has a specific look and costume associated with every song he does. So on stage, he basically brings the videos to life. Red jacket - Beat It. Blue Shirt/Rope belt - Way U Make Me Feel. 30's Gangster suits - Smooth Criminal. Tuxedo Pants/Glove- you know that one.  But, I still have to say again that the highlight of this show is that he is having incredible fun, smiling, and SINGING the WHOLE THING!  This, coupled with the incredible amount of movement and dancing, is really quite a great feat of strength and skill.  Then after, or before, you watch this show you can look at the tour schedule that comes with the DVD and realize that he would do this every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for a over a year! Incredible! I cannot name one single artist today who could even do that for an hour.

Amazing that so many reviews here complain about the video quality.  C'mon, its 1988!  The sound and video are as perfect as it needs to be.  This is classic footage, the likes of which will never be seen again.

The most astonishing thing for me is experiencing Michael Jackson at precisely the prime period of his craft and skill. This concert is before the Pepsi commercial accident, which burnt his head, requiring surgeries and began his journey into painkilling additions. It's also before the child molestation allegations, before the severe physical changes he underwent to his skin and facial construction. It's just a excellent snap shot in his life.

5130896,2,B0084I9QIW,"Here's an honest review with clear glasses vs. the rosey glasses that most seem to be wearing. The good news is that MJ is on top of his game here and gives a great performance, but the video quality is absolutely not up to par. I think it stinks, compared to todays standards. As a perfectionist, my guess is that he would not have wanted this released, because of this. This is ""clearly"" a money grab...The video quality is VHS like and there's no debating that. IMO, this release should be purchased by only the hardest core MJ fans or ""completists"". I regret my purchase. It was an impulse purchase at a big box store. Because of the poor video quality, even two stars is kind...I don't think I'll be watching again. Overall, Michael Jackson: Live in Bucharest, is a far superior DVD. It's video quality is night & day compared to this one. Also, I suggest buying some ""pro shot"" bootlegs of his more recent concerts if you want HD or modern quality. There are many, if you look...I wish reviewers would give honest, non biased reviews/critiques...

Update, Interesting how people are (still)giving this 5 stars while admitting the video quality stinks...? Most of us prefer that people rate the product, not the film itself...Objective vs. subjective...Many of us rely on ratings when making purchases but so many somehow blindly look past the poor picture quality. They're rating MJ, not the DVD...and that doesn't make much sense. I guess thats where the term 'fanatic' comes into play. This DVD is actually made from a VHS tape and it shows.

It has great photos, small hard pics, a poster, the first Bad, another version with songs previously unreleased and a DVD of this concert. I suggest getting the Bad special edition that came out before MJ died too. It has previoulsy unrealesed songs,but not as many as the 25th edition and commentary by Quincy Jones.",1353283200,,402,4.676056338028169

5130910,5,B0084I9QIW,This is possibly Michael Jackson's greatest concert! Here he is at his absolute prime and every song if 100% live which is astonishing as the dance routines are so energetic!

5130911,5,B0084I9QIW,"First of all I am a huge fan of MJ's live performances. I have a total of 7: 2 Bad Tours, 1 Dangerous, and 4 HIStory; and now I have another Bad Tour, Wembley, so a total of 8. And that's not including the concerts with the Jacksons I also have. Now that that's out of the way, the review.

This is definitely in the top 3, I could argue top 2, best concerts from him. What makes it that good are the moves: he rarely ever stays still. You cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a few seconds or you'll risk missing a glide, pop, or spin. You can easily see James Brown's influence in this performance. On top of all this he is performing some of his greatest songs: Wanna Be Startin Somethin, Another Part of Me, Human Nature.... and the list goes on.

If you are a fan you will own this, it's that simple. If you are not a fan you will be after watching it. Now, off to watch it again.",1352592000,5,894,3.988826815642458

5130914,5,B0084I9QIW,"Watching his eccentric vocal and dance expression on the one but an empathetic interpretation on the other hand, made me forget time and space. Though picture's quality is changing, the tone appropriately has been revised and by all recordings are concentrated on the artist at stage, they intentionally cut out the audience fainting one after another. We are shown an extraordinary man, we are given the chance of watching Michael Jackson's variety on probably his best concert tour ever. This DVD is a must not only for the hardcore fans but even for those who believed MJ's music would be forgotten soon, it wouldn't be worth mentioning any more.",1352332800,,649,4.963302752293578

The imagery and picture quality are just FINE! I bought this DVD of the concert at Wal-Mart and I don't usually buy a lot of entertainment (CDs/DVDs) from Wal-Mart. I may not have a flat screen HD TV in my bedroom but I have two downstairs in my home and all of them produce great visual quality with this Concert DVD. My old Tube TV also has ""high quality"" even though it's not an HD TV. It doesn't matter what type of TV you have or what the Quality is that the DVD was produced with. People need glasses. There's nothing wrong with the quality. The images are crystal clear as if you're right there in the audience seeing the King of Pop live.

I would definitely recommend this concert DVD to any MJ die hard fan. Or even someone who just likes watching him dance and sing on stage making magic wherever he is. Whatever the case of what type of Fan you are, I'd still tell the world to buy this DVD. I know I absolutely love it. Who needs HD and Blu-Ray? Not me for one. Some things are just better watched in it's almost original formats. Hell, most of my VHS movies have better visual quality than some HD videos.",1352073600,6,1271,4.25206611570248
5130916,3,B0084I9QIW,"Michael just blows his audience away with his performance. The problem...if any...with this concert dvd is the quality. It is not a bad job on any body's part, it is simply from 1988! The technology simply did not exist back then to make this performance all that it could be. Michael's performance however, it is GREAT and deserves 5 stars.",1351814400,2,341,4.7
5130917,5,B0084I9QIW,"This DVD of Michael Jackson's BAD tour in London is awesome!  I wish Michael Jackson completed his Dangerous Tour as well.  It sucks because after the BAD tour, Michael Jackson never toured the United States of America.

His HIStory tour only had one stop on U.S. soil and that was in Honolulu, Hawaii, which was sold at as well.

Even though Michael Jackson is an American, he abandoned the United States of America after 1993.  Guess it makes sense
because the media continuosly criticized Michael Jackson.

I wonder what it would be like if Michael Jackson never used propofol and completed his This Is It concerts in London.

Would the United States of America ever accept Michael Jackson back as a pop singer if he were alive today?",1351123200,,737,4.7109375

Not as many theatrics as later concerts just Michael, dancers, musicains, and background singers, tearing it up. I love it.",1350345600,,416,4.791666666666667

Anyone who appreciates live shows will be happy watching this. There is no one that can equal Michael Jackson and on this particular night at Wembley he was on top of his game.",1350086400,,392,4.171052631578948
5130923,5,B0084I9QIW,"My only question is, why would they take so long to release some so brilliant? Growing up listening to MJ, the Bad era was and still by far my favorite and ever since I watched his Bucharest concert when it first aired I always wondered if we would see any older concerts at all. All I can say that it's a shame they kept this locked up for so long, but now that we have it all I can say now is FINALLY!

I am very happy with this release. I feel this performance exceeded that of the Dangerous concert. The entire focus was MJ and the band and if there was anything that defined the art of music and performance this is it. MJ performed songs in this concert that he has not performed since like ""This Place Hotel"", ""Dirty Diana"", ""Rock With You"". Plus, we still get the good stuff like, ""Beat It"", ""Billie jean"", etc. You see MJ was having fun in this concertas he smiled a lot more and was very energetic. Every performance was high energy. MJ is a prime example of being one with music. Also the band gets some time to shine as they have a little jam session in mid-show which I think was pretty cool.

I see many people complained about the video qulaity. Well we get what we can get. Besides, this was ripped from the original VHS recordings so the footage can only be restored so much. Considering what we have in this release it's really not bad. I just think many of us have been spoiled with HD we expect everything in HD. This is a good release so don't let that get you down. It's worth it.

Now, I'm wondering when we will get anything from the Victory Tour.",1350000000,3,1571,4.195364238410596

This is EVERYTHING that I remember Michael Jackson to be at his prime on the Bad Tour! I was not disappointed one bit at this DVD or his performance! If you're like me and you're TRUE Michael Jackson fan, you HAVE to get this for your collection, it is very well worth the money! I can't wait for the Blu-Ray edition to be released on this performance which I hope is very soon!",1349222400,,500,4.273684210526316
5130925,5,B0084I9QIW,"I have watched the Dangerous Tour, Bad tour in Japan, HISTory tours in the Philippines, Korea, Copenhagen, the Jacksons and Jackson 5 live shows and some clips of concerts in YouTube but this Bad Concert surpasses all of them. The close-up of Michael in this video is breathtaking. Trickles of perspiration, raw emotion, enduring passion in every song took my breath away. I had tears in my eyes watching him. I couldn't keep my eyes off him for the whole 2 hours and 15 minutes and I still did not want it to end. It is very intimate and truly a performance for royalty. You can't help but feel that Michael is singing just for you alone not for 72,000 fans.

The sound is amazing and the restoration is pretty good considering this is from a 25 year old VHS, Yes, a quarter of a century and still Michael sounds so ""now."" I know this concert will make a new generation of Michael Jackson fans. If you are not a Michael Jackson fan, you will be one after you have seen this concert.

For this price, it is a steal to own the greatest concert of all time, in fact the greatest entertainment of all time. I am indeed lucky to have lived during the same time as Michael Jackson, the King.

I know I will be watching this concert again and again as I do the Dangerous Tour and all of Michael's concert. This will be the crown of them all.",1349136000,5,1335,4.2896825396825395
5130926,5,B0084I9QIW,"If you are not one of those people who are so spoiled by modern technology that they are only able to enjoy something if it's HD/Blue-ray quality then I highly recommend this concert!

Jackson's Estate did not make a secret of the fact that they could only find an old VHS in his personal collection from which they could restore the video of this concert. The camera angles aren't perfect either as what you see on the video is what was recorded for the Jumbotrons during the concert. The audio on the other hand was recorded on multitracks, so that's great.

Despite of these handicaps I still rate this concert 5 stars because Jackson's mesmerizing performance more than makes up for them! Surprisingly the stage show is rather purist, especially compared to what we see in many concerts today. No spectacular stage scenes, no high-tech effects, no laser shows, no fireworks, not even an army of dancers (there are only four, besides Jackson himself), no strip shows, no pole dancers. There are a couple of costume changes (like the inevitable warewolf and zombies in Thriller), but we cannot talk about a parade of spectacular costumes either. Mainly it's just Jackson and his singing and dancing. And that is good so! Actually it's one of the most impressive things to me about this concert and Jackson himself: that the concert has a kind of magic feel to it, you just cannot take your eyes off the screen for two straight hours, it's highly entertaining, enjoyable, uplifting, breath-taking, mesmerizing - and that's all down to Jackson and his talent, charisma and stage presence and not to stage gimmicks and high-tech! He was a truly great performer.

Maybe because of the lack of gimmicks and high-tech, but the concert has a kind of intimate charm too - if you can say that about a show in front of 72,000 people. It's hard to put this into words but I don't see the type of mechanical, calculating, cold artificiality in it that I see in so many concerts by other singing-dancing stars. Jackson is light on his feet, he's cool, relaxed, joyful, clearly enjoying himself, like he was born to do it. He probably was. His happiness is infectious too. And all the while he's putting on an amazing show.",1348963200,29,2211,4.72279792746114

So let me tell you, MJ is brilliant, BAD tour fantastic! With that being said, the quality of this DVD sucks! Common, VHS tape transfer? Really they couldn't do better than that?

For the first time ever I felt like returning a MJ product! So buyers be aware, this will look pretty bad on your flat screen TVs! Sound is great though.

I'm looking forward to the next 10-15 years when someone will ""find"" a decent footage of the BAD tour and release it on blu-ray.",1348790400,10,587,4.425925925925926

5130929,5,B0084I9QIW,"This DVD is a true treasure. Some have complained about the quality of the film, but it's just fine to me being that this was re-mastered from an old cassette tape.

Michael looks gorgeous in this. He sounds a little winded at times but he still sounds good! I love the Smooth Criminal and Human Nature performances. And of course the Rock With You and Man in the MIrror performances as well.

Not thrilled about the I Just Can't Stop Loving You performance, but it's not because of Michael, but because of Sheryl. Her voice leaves A LOT to be desired.

His dancing is mesmerizing and I thoroughly enjoyed the musical break when musical director Greg Phillinganes and Co. were rocking out!!

I was smiling from ear-to-ear when he introduced the backup singers, musicians and his dancers at the very end. He seemed so enthusiastic. HE really had an appreciation for those who worked with him.

I LOVED THIS!!! And I encourage all MJ fans to get it!! It's a decent price and you will be thoroughly entertained!",1348444800,2,1008,4.640449438202247
5130930,5,B0084I9QIW,"I wrote the review about the Michael Jackson: Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Jackson-Live-in-Bucharest-The-Dangerous-Tour/dp/B000A2RRF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Jackson: Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour</a>.  I actually went to the Dangerous concerts but never got to see the Bad concerts apart from some of the unofficial ones on tape which were poor quality so I waited a long time for this DVD.

To say this DVD is earth-shattering is an understatement, the concert is raw, dynamic and totally exhilarating.  The best thing about it are the close-ups of Michael, you will never see him up-close like this ever.  Of course we are used to seeing his energy which always lights up a stage but in this concert you see him at his very best, his movement is amazing and you see a happy Michael who is at the top of his game musically and dance-wise.  The vocals are incredible, the sound from this DVD is sharp, clear - almost electric and it pierces through the speakers.

This is taken from Michael's personal tapes which were Super VHS.  In case you don't know Super VHS is almost equivalent in quality to DVD so the quality overall is excellent.  No it is not HD but lets be honest, if you really want to see a 'raw' concert then you don't need it.  This fits in with the time of the concert which was in 1988.

I am not going to speak about all the individual songs, every one is incredible and shows the different dimensions of Michael but I will say that Dirty Diana is my favorite.  Michael is known for his ballads but he is the perfect live Rock musician and Jennifer Batten with her distinctive mane of bright white hair is a brilliant accompaniment to MJ.  The performance is awesome, the singing, the guitar, the energy - he blasts you out of the stadium!

I can't recommend this concert enough, if you want to see Michael as we were always supposed to see him then this is the concert to watch.  In my opinion it is better than Dangerous and even History which I also saw live.

Last note: Michael Jackson is a genius and one the best live performers ever, we should respect his legacy and this is a part of it that should not be missed.

5130933,5,B0084I9QIW,"I don't usually write reviews, but after watching this, I just felt compelled to put in my two cents. I had been waiting for a BAD tour official dvd to come out for many years and when it was announced early in the year that the Michael Jackson Estate would release it on a dvd, I was beyond ecstatic. Then finally I received the dvd yesterday and watched it immediately. W.O.W. It certainly exceeded my expectation.  Admittedly, the quality isn't 100% perfect considering it was converted from a VHS tape of 25 years old, but the quality is still good (the Estate did a great job restoring it, which I really appreciate!) and it didn't really bother me that much because Michael Jackon is simply MAGNIFICIENT. He sings and dances perfectly and he is just breathtakingly beautiful with full of energy and you get two full hours of pure MJ with a lot of close ups and without much of crowd shots! I just couldn't take my eyes off of him the whole time watching it. I love his Dangerous tour too, but this is way better than that. It really shows why he is the greatest entertainer that ever lived and the undisputed King of Pop.",1348185600,4,1127,4.444444444444445
5130934,5,B0084I9QIW,"This concert truly changes lives. Someone who isn't a Michael Jackson fan will become an obsessed Michael Jackson fan just from watching and listening to this concert. You will never be the same afterwards. You will become unstoppable after you experience this heavenly performance.

Michael Jackson's BAD concert at Wembley Stadium is not just the greatest concert and musical experience ever, it is the greatest thing I ever ever seen, heard or felt in my entire life! It's a truly life-changing experience.

Greater than any movie, greater than any other concert or performance, greater than any sporting event, the greatest thing you will ever see and experience in your life!

Michael Jackson's dancing and energy defies the laws of physics. His singing and vocals defy all adjectives. The music and the sounds are magical. The heart and the soul is indescribable. You experience this concert and you leave a changed person for the better. The magic gets inside your heart, bones, and soul. I can't stop smiling during the entire two hours and beyond. This concert is greater than anything anyone can imagine. You want to know what it feels like in Heaven? It feels like the way you feel as you experience this concert.

Michael Jackson is truly a Champion and a hero. MJ really cares about inspiring people to go after all their dreams, trust in God, never give up, and become the person you were meant to become.

The greatest singing, vocals, emotion ever! The greatest dancing ever! The greatest performing ever. It's the greatest ever because it truly changes your life. You become so inspired that nothing can stop you from achieving all your dreams after you experience this concert. It is truly addicting. You will watch and listen to it over and over and over and over.

Thank you Michael! Thank you for everything! Words can't describe the greatness. Man in the Mirror, make that change!!! The Truth Always Triumphs! Victory! This Is It!",1348185600,3,1952,4.9179331306990886

The talent level and energy on display by Michael here is astounding and mesmerizing. Like many other longtime fans i'd been waiting decades for an official video release from this tour and this DVD has exceeded my expectations tenfold. Sure, the 1980s 4:3 videotape quality is marginal, and even the 5.1 audio isn't all that spectacular but who really cares when the content is this good? In terms of official video releases, this blows away anything else you've ever seen. If your only real exposure has been the Dangerous DVD, youtube vidoes, or This Is It -- just wait until you see this one. Throw it in the DVD player for your skeptical friends and relatives and watch their jaws drop, yes it's that good.

he truly was a once in a lifetime Musical Genius on Stage and in the studio and the songs are timeless and speak of his greatness and to  go back and see it all again is a great treat.

5130941,5,B0084I9QIW,"I have to tell you, I've seen every Michael Jackson performance I can find (from Victory to History, to J5 performances) and the thing I love about MJ's live shows is the way he morphs these songs into something he feels, then we see his physical embodiment of those feelings. This is by far the best show I've seen him put on. You watch it, and initially the quality gets to you, then you see Michael and you find yourself smiling throughout the whole thing, and you feel almost like you're sneaking a view of something sacred. I finished and watched it again. It's phenomenal. Better than Dangerous, better than the dreams I've had of This Is It being. If you've seen many Michael Jackson performances, you've seen things or heard things you wished were different: well it's like he fixed it all for this show. For example: I hate the breathy Human Nature on Dangerous (that was actually better on This is It), well in this one, he sings his heart out. I love the Moonwalker Man in the Mirror - well this one is better.

The only two songs that are lackluster are Dirty Diana and Thriller but everything else is amazing. I never understood why people said this was Michael at his peak, but watching him in this video, more than Yokahama, you can tell he is dancing and singing like he's still not sure of his place in history. It's magic on film.

Most impressive part is that he's 29 years old, sings every songs and dances harder than he did. This is him at his best because his dancing was still fresh and he was young and energized, and his voice is spot on. When he was younger, he was still finding himself. By Dangerous he was just lazy and cocky.

If you like Michael Jackson a little bit, just get it. It's a well spent $12 and you'll be a fan.",1347926400,13,1755,4.36085626911315
5130942,3,B0084I9QIW,"My favorite album from Michael Jackson has always been BAD. The videos and the look were so cool to me. I've always considered it to be his best album. The title tracks video was actually my first memory of Michael Jackson.

I've waited years and years to see this concert. I've signed petitions just to get this amazing concert on DVD or something so us unfortunate fans who weren't old enough to see it live could at least witness it. Our prayers were finally answered! September 18th, 2012.

I prepared to spend at least $20 on the DVD if the price ever got that steep. Fortunately for me it didnt.

To be honest I was kind of disappointed.

Let me point out the good things about the concert before I point out the negatives.

The Positive.

Michael Jackson is spectacular. He's an amazing performer. His vocals are perfect and his dancing is top notch.
The set list is pretty great. Although the show doesn't really flow that well together, its still a great set list. He clearly was saving his best songs for the encore.

The Negative.

The quality is crappy. I understand that the this actually was formatted from a video tape but it's really terrible. It looks like a low quality YouTube video.
Its also presented in widescreen format which stretches the video. So it makes Michael look a little awkward. Like he's top heavy and then really small legs that are barely visible sometimes.
I kind of got bored. It was a great show but it didn't hold my attention for much longer.

Overall I'm satisfied. I wanted more but..I'm satisfied. I don't know if I'm going to sell it or keep it for later viewing.",1347926400,4,1609,4.539792387543253
5130943,5,B0084I9QIW,"First things first. I've been wanting this Bad tour for so long that I felt the day would never come and it finally has. I woke up at 7:30Am just to be at Target at 8am when they opened to buy this thing. Now that I finally have it I'm in disbelief.

Over the period when this DVD wasn't available I searched the internet, high and low, to the farthest corners of the world wide web just to find footage of this epic concert and I can't tell you how many horrible bootlegs of this tour I've had to endure. The only one worthy of viewing as far as quality wise was the Bad in Japan tour September 12, 1987 at the Krokuen Stadium, which is available on youtube. It is an actual edited and directed show and the quality was like a worn out VHS tape at best. I dreamed of when an official copy would come out.

Now we got this! This show is exceptional! The quality is super VHS with a good job at converting it to DVD. It looks way better than how it would look on your VCR but don't expect for it to be high definition or anything. I'm pretty sure some technical freaks are going to complain, claiming a better transfer could have been done but I doubt it. I've transferred VHS to DVD before and in my opinion this is one of the best jobs I have ever seen. You also have to remember this VHS tape is 25 years old! And yes, this is far far far better than youtube quality, trust me. I've seen all those youtube concerts this is way better.

AND DON'T LISTEN TO THAT REVIEWER WHO SAYS THAT THE PRODUCERS FORMATTED THIS INTO WIDESCREEN AND THAT IT STRETCHES THE IMAGE TO MAKE MJ LOOK AWKWARD!! THAT PERSON IS A FOOL WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THE FEATURES OF THEIR OWN TV! This dvd is formatted in the 4:3 aspect ratio, not 16:9 letterbox!!! To the person who said that: check your remote or TV manual to fix that, man!

 The real gem is the 5.1 Dolby sound and the fact that it is one of the greatest concerts of all time. A concert MJ performed for Princess Diana.

My only gripe was how some of the show's theatrics were missing when compared to the Japan one. Like the guitarist with the crazy hair when she does her ""Beat It"" guitar solo, no laser shoots out from her guitar like in the Japan one which was so awesome! Also on this DVD there is a 10 minute interlude where MJ's band jam out while MJ takes a break/changes wardrobe. This was okay (Snack/Bathroom break) but I'd rather have seen a performance of a song that was excluded from this show and was performed in the Japan one, such as songs like ""Shake Your Body"" and ""My Lovely One"" but I guess even the King deserves a 10 minute break, ha ha! I also noticed that the directing in the Japan one was just a tad more creative and innovative. All this is not a bad thing just an observation. Nevertheless this DVD has the better set of songs and is a 100% MJ, no footage of fans (I'll elaborate more on this later) and I can't be any more happier!

The performances of ""Dirty Diana"" and ""Man in the Mirror"" were the the best in my opinion. they literally gave me chills. It's hard to believe just how much energy MJ has! He just keeps dancing and movinglike a machine. It's simply amazing. Another great thing about this performance in contrast to the Japan one is that it included way more singles off the ""Bad"" album. The only tracks from the ""Bad"" album in the Japan one were ""Bad"" and ""i can't Stop Loving You."" This DVD has all the hit singles from the ""Bad"" album except ""The Way You Make Me Feel,"" but the producers of this DVD were smart  and caring enough to put a performance of ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" as a bonus feature and it is an excellent performance that is in slightly lesser visual quality than the main feature. THANK YOU TO THE PRODUCERS OF THIS DVD FOR THAT!!!

Another great special feature is the fact that they have two songs from the actual Japan tour i mentioned and when you see them you'll notice that the visual quality is way better than this main feature. The reason why they chose to give the London performance the special treatment is because the sound quality is way better because it was recorded on a multi-track. Nevertheless it was awesome of the producers to include some footage from the Japan tour that i mentioned.

In comparison with the previously released ""Dangerous tour"" DVD, the directing of this concert was way better! The problem and only problem with the ""Dangerous"" recording was that for the first half of the DVD they show too much footage of the fans passing out when they should have focused on MJ and his performance. I'm glad to say that this DVD is 100% MJ!!!! There's no footage of fans passing out every 20 seconds like in the ""Dangerous"" tour or cuts to poorly lit and underexposed footage of fans like in the Japan version. The directing for this concert focuses all it's energy on MJ and the stage, as it should. This is the real gem of this DVD and why I would choose this over all the other performances available, be it bootleg or an officially released DVD. This is ""the one.""

As far as the packaging goes, it is a cardboard case with pictures of fans, MJ, and Princess Diana all over. It comes with a beautiful picture book that lists every single concert date for this famous and legendary tour. my only problem with the case is that it doesn't include a snap case for the actual DVD, instead you have to slide it in and out of a cardboard sleeve. Honestly every time I take it out I'm afraid I'll scratch it, so be careful when you pull it out and check to see if taking it out or putting it in actually does scratch it. The jury is still out on this aspect of the case.

This is an amazing DVD. Buy it. You won't regret it. For the price it is an absolute bargain. You'll get chills, you'll dance and you'll cry. I know I did. Thank you for finally getting it right Sony (never thought I'd ever say that!)",1347926400,140,5837,4.262872628726288
5130944,5,B0084I9QIW,"Nothing against the DVD from the Dangerous tour, but this DVD is 10 times better than that DVD!  This is the first authorized release of the Bad tour on DVD in honor of the 25th anniversary of that album taped from Wembley Stadium in the summer of 1988 with Princess Diana attending.  The non HD 80's video quality does not take away from such a brilliant performance of a master at the peak of his performing prowless.  The video is restored to the best of its ability, the sound is mixed amazingly and no fast camera shots on the crowd or much loud crowd noise overdubs like Budapest only focusing on MJ with great camera work and clear vocals and music.  This is the MJ live DVD that us diehard fans have been waiting on and are so happy that this was found by the estate with it being released and to be enjoyed by all generations of fans for years to come.  This is definitely a must buy for not just MJ fans like me, but also lovers of all music and those who want to see a dynamic performance by the greatest live performer of all time.  Long live the King of Pop!",1347840000,48,1071,4.2
5130945,5,B0084I9QIW,"Ok so I'm not for cussing or anything like that but When I saw Another Part Of Me clip, I don't know what my reaction was but ppl. around me deff. thought I was Crazy like cirqe du soleil. NOT kidding!

I Love Michael Jackson for MORE than his music but on this review, I'm gonna let you in a little secret. Are You ready??? Well here it is. Michael Jackson Is AN AMAZING (For a lack of a better word) PERFORMER, ENTERTAINER etc... He's got the WHOLE PACKAGE! I've been Obsessed with HIS DANGEROUS TOUR Vids for a while, then His HIStory tour... Then Went back to the ol' days VICTORY Tour... etc...

And NOW WE GET TO SEE MICHAEL AT HIS PEAK! But 1990's was a PEAK for him too. Tell me if you have NOT watched the Dangerous tour and thought F***ing AMAZING! Well THIS BAD TOUR is F***ing AMAZING (X 10). A fellow fan said that she works @ HMV in the UK and that her Manager had put thIS VERY Same DVD on EVERY TV there and People who were gonna walk out stayed there just watching and ppl. even Kids who seemed indifferent also glanced Once, twice, three times and More @ the Video... MICHAEL IS THE ONLY ARTIST that Makes you STOP Where You are and watch him even if you have a lot of things on ur Mind!

SO people If you don't get this DVD, or The Deluxe box set for BAD 25, I canNOT tell you enough How you're Missing Out on something WONDERFUL. IT Might even change your life!

I hope to hear from more reviewers SOON! <3

5130947,4,B0084I9QIW,"They should release the 1st leg of Yokohama's concert on DVD.  There are a lot of DVDs out there of Yokohama concert with horrible sound. Why not invest in a studio like they did with the Wembley concert and bring true 5.1 surround sound to the Yokohama's concert as well? It does no justice to the legacy of Michael Jackson by not giving the fans the best experience possible and see what make the man GREAT. And there is no such thing as too many releases when it come to Michael Jackson.  People just can't get enough of his performances. I am surprise the man never EVER got a TRUE official DVD release of his BAD concert EVER until now.  And we're talking about the King of POP who are known all over the world and yet not a single official DVD disc to capture the moment of his greatness during the Bad era?? The moment of what makes the man so great!! Even Bruce Lee got a lot of his films on DVDs. If you say...oh because there is no DVD format during the 80s....but hey Bruce Lee's films were never meant to be in DVD format to begin with.  And if you make other excuses like....oh because MJ's Bad concerts were not captured on films? Huh?? You got to be kidding me right? The man traveled all over the world doing the Bad concerts in different countries.  Surely, television were invented back then right?? And sure, they were captured on films. How can he went all over the world and only Japan being the only country captured his greatness on film? It doesn't add up.

UPDATE:
Okay, so i just received the Wembley's Concert DVD today and just finished watching it.  Here's my honest review of the DVD. Before I do, let me just say that I have seen the Yokohama DVD, the Brisbane and the various clips of the BAD concerts here and there and i know that none of them are DVD quality. They were not meant to be DVD quality. But at the same time, they're not HIGH-QUALITY either.  I am a bit disappointed with all of the DVD releases so far of Michael Jackson's BAD concerts...and YES that include Michael Jackson's Wembley.  Sure, it's a tag better than the other DVDs in term of overall presentation...but it's just ""a tag"" better.  In other words, in a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being blue ray and 9 being DVD quality, Wembley fall somewhere around 4 or 5. The Yokohama BAD concert is visually slightly better than Wembley but c'mon it doesn't make much of a difference really...both are bad VHS quality visually. The Wembley's visual looks like its paint washed out even watching it in 4:3. It is definitely watchable but you just wish the visual is crisp and rich and golden like MJ's performance on stage but it's just not there.  Now i know why they don't put the Yokohama on DVD as well.  It really doesn't matter.  When the source of the visual are bad, it doesn't matter if you put it on DVD or not, it won't help that much.

Update on visual:  Okay, watching it on PC with the TotalMediaTheatre5 software, i can make adjustment and bring the visual quality up a notch. So instead of rating it 4 or 5 out of 10, I am giving it a 6/10. This is for watching it on PC. If you watch it on external system like Xbox 360 or PS3, the visual will go down a notch.

As far as overall performance of MJ, when it started out the first half or so of the songs, i say to myself, it's nothing i didn't see before in Yokohama.  But in the 2nd half, his performance getting more intense with incredible move after move from the Smooth Criminal all the way to the BAD performance.  His dancing is so much fluid. He just couldn't stop dancing.  Even when the show ended and he started giving credit to his casts, it is a treat to see him continue dancing along.  That in itself is incredible, better than Yokohama's ending.  Smooth Criminal (although not in Yokohama) is incredible...so is Thriller (definitely better than Yokohama and I love the beat). Beat It is alright.  Billie Jean (i think the ending of Billie Jean is better than Yokohama as he does more moves with more gracefulness).  Bad is also a must-see same like Yokohama!

As far as the sound go...it is okay, a bit better than Yokohama.  I have the Harman/Kardon sound system and when i play music videos off of my PC, the sound w/ the bass is INCREDIBLE.  I don't feel the same with the Wembley's concert.  Like the visual, I feel the sound is in the same rating.

UPDATE ON SOUND QUALITY: Okay, i watched this on my PC and the sound and visual can be adjusted, and the sound is pretty darn good i must say w/ the bass adjusted.  So it's just a matter of what kind of software and hardware you have in order to take advantage of this gem. I use TotalMediaTheatre5 software.

So my conclusion is this.  Since the performance and the sound are incredible than the Yokohama's DVD, I will say this is the best release TO DATE of ANY MJ's Bad Concert! But better in terms of what?? In a scale of 1-10, it doesn't even meet the high-quality standard...let alone DVD quality.  If you don't mind of the visual and just want to experience an MJ's concert in a VHS format, get this (try watching it on PC).  If you never seen a Michael Jackson's concert in your life, you will be blown away.

I definitely want to own this DVD because MJ's performance is incredible and i forgot to mention...I really REALLY like the video angle capture of MJ in this concert than the one in Yokohama because you can see MJ's full view close up in all his glory.  That's why i wish they find the UMATIC version and restore the visual because it is such a treat to see MJ perform this incredible yet the visual didn't meet the standard.",1346025600,20,5571,4.334296724470135
