I would only recommend this to a true Wilder or classic-French cinema fan. But now that I've written my disclaimers I'll tell you what I did like about this film. I went into this film somewhat hesitant, even though Billy Wilder is easily my favorite director. It did not take long, though, to realize that this master auteur had already begun to develop his signature style. From the subtle comedic undertones, to the almost pre-noir finale, there is definitely a Wilder vibe to this film.

  The previous reviewer stated the car chase aspects of the film, I do find these interesting but I prefer the character development. The film focuses on spoiled playboy Henri Pasquier (Pierre Mingand) whom after a quarrel with his father is forced to fend for himself. Starting with Jean's estrangement from his father, the film shows his gradual moral and financial deterioration on his journey to self awareness. After some incidents that involve his car he meets kleptomaniac Jean, whom along with his sister Jeannette (an absolutely gorgeous Danielle Darrieux) works at a Parisian chop shop. The plot from here is a little melodramatic and cliche, but nonetheless interesting. I would definitely recommend this curio to anyone that loves or respects the work of Billy Wilder as much as I do.",1180310400,5,1402,4.9071729957805905
8293963,5,B00006LPE7,"The great German-born director, Billy Vilder, on his vay from Deutschland to Hollywood, stopped off in Paris to make this early car chase classic.  A young French dandy, suddenly down on his luck, falls in with a slick gang of car thieves who run a phony auto shop, and who take him in and teach him the ropes in their cynical racket.  He also falls in love, and attempts to break away from his criminal pals in order to live a clean life with his gal.  Pretty cool presentation of French life in the interwar era, and of the growing fascination with the newly blooming car culture.  Great crosscountry chase sequence at the end; fun stuff throughout.  Recommended!",1041465600,5,665,4.601694915254237
