8677285,4,B00NBU465Q,"Excellent production, as fine as any I've seen. The music is beautifully performed, and so too was the acting. Right down to the facial expressions, it was charming and engaging. Unfortunately, I was forced to mark it down because of poor disc production. The beginning of the disc is a fraction of some other opera, totally unrelated, beginning somewhere toward its end. It took us quite some time to figure out that H&G was actually on the disc and how to get to it. Very poor disc production.",1509062400,2,495,4.636363636363637
8677286,5,B00NBU465Q,"The most striking characteristic of this opera is its music. It takes Wagner's sophistication in harmony, polyphony and orchestration; and creates delightful music and simple tunes that kids, and even grownups can enjoy and easily relate to.
The lyrics are based on Grimm Brothers story.  A story that many parents will not tell their young children today, at least in the original version.  This production is more than appropriate for kids.  Most of the magic is shown in Maurice Sendaks set designs.  Anyone familiar with his childrens books will find the sets familiar and as magical as his books are. It is the music, orchestra, vocal, and the sets that elevate this to a master performance.  The singers are vocally very appealing and their acting is very convincing. In particular, Nikitenau and Harteilus as Hansel and Gretel respectively.  The known Evening Prayer aria, in Act 2, is beautifully sung.
The recording is from a life performance in 1999, and although it is a Blu-ray recording, the sound is stereo only.
I strongly recommend this production. You will watch it many times. If possible watch it with children.",1463011200,,1130,5.016042780748663
8677287,5,B00NBU465Q,"My  wife used to listen to this with her father every Christmas beginning when she was about ten. She would reminisce about how much that time together meant to her (and I am sure her father as well). The music is exactly as my wife remembers and the production in Blu-ray is visually stunning with the set and costumes designed by author Maurice Sendak. I had two minor problems. In the beginning some of the syncing of voice with the singer's mouthing seemed slightly off. This was only at the beginning and was fine throughout virtually all. Secondly, since this was a filming of a live performance, there were a couple of instances where the placing of the microphones caused the music to overwhelm the singers' voices. Again, these are only minor annoyances and should not cause a fan of this opera to not purchase this item. I played this through my 4K Samsung with soundbar and it was worth listening and watching. I would recommend this to fans of this opera.",1420329600,4,967,4.622093023255814
8677288,5,B00NBU465Q,I wanted this particular version of Hansel and Gretel because of the Maurice Sendak sets and other artwork. It is in German but English subtitles are included. This is a stellar production. The main characters and children's chorus are top rate and the witch is a scary delight.,1420156800,3,278,4.8125
8677289,5,B00NBU465Q,Excellent production singing wonderful sets superb to bad it was not sung in English which may discourage the American family. If you are a Wagnerian purest this one is for you,1419206400,,176,4.709677419354839
8677290,5,B00NBU465Q,The music was excellent although it was done by a European orchestra and it sounded different than the American versions.  The familiar themes were not present although it was a very good rendition of the work.  It is the best audio of classical music I have heard in digital media.,1417996800,,282,4.62
8677291,5,B00NBU465Q,"This is a wonderful filming of a wonderful performance of wonderful opera.  I have been involved with performances of this piece and everything is well done.  The use of the children's chorus in the first scene is a tad confusing, but that's really my only complaint.",1417910400,2,267,4.782608695652174
8677292,5,B00NBU465Q,Love this production.  it is always refreshing to see what Mr. Sendak can do with designing an opera with his personal style.,1416009600,2,125,4.681818181818182
