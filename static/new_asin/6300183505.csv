218152,5,6300183505,"Quite a powerful bio-doccie on Joplin, featuring great highlights from her performing career.  There's lots of scenes of Janis talking and early pics of her life. She comes across as having been honest and unpretentious. Her high school reunion scene is funny and sad at the same time and it's the only place where she appears uncomfortable. The music is great and this film is well put together. A must for fans of Joplin.",1030233600,10,423,4.716216216216216
218153,4,6300183505,"I come from my first viewing of this film with an idea of why Janis' spirit is so troubling for many who shared the period with her.
The interviews:
One first notices how uptight, repressed, and dated the interviewers dress and act.  I doubt they were reacting to Janis' persona or reputation. They and many of their viewers were just that way.  Cavett's outfit is laughable (and Janis does so).  Questions were mostly inane but Janis generally rises above them to give us a clear view of who she is.  Except at the reunion,  she is completely at ease.
Did you know that Dick Cavett is still on the air, announcing for the Detroit Symphony's broadcasts?  Wouldn't you like to ask him about the interview?
The reunion:
As has been written before, this ill-concieved foray was nearly her undoing.  Janis seemed near tears as interviewers pressed her with more inane, repetitive questions.  Again, she was surrounded by serious caricatures of the uptight, repressed 'straight' '60s society she came from but she appears to us as 'just Janis'.
Performances:
While others onstage exhibit extreme, period-identifiable and attention-grabbing excesses of costume and behavior, she dresses much as we all do today.  Minimum makeup and adornment that would distract from her uncompromised message.
Did you notice, her slight S. Texas accent is only apparent in the sequences at the class reunion.  Conclusion:
While most performers of all periods are somewhat unidimensional, Janis is 'bright and articulate', but can instantly and seamlessly change to 'desperately passionate'. Both phases are the same person, a concept she constantly and eloquently tries to sell to an unprepared world.  It is no wonder that she 'wore out' so quickly.",996883200,17,1728,5.1138790035587185

I FOUND THIS FILM TO BE JUST GREAT. GAVE A GOOD INSIDE ON HOW SHE WAS.  I DO THINK SHE WAS WAY AHEAD OF HER TIME.  HER MUSIC FANTASTIC, ALL.  THIS VIDIO IS MUST FOR ALL HER FANS, WHO KNEW HER, WHO DID NOT KNOW HER, AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HER, HAVE NOT HEARD HER MUSIC ITS A MOST GET.
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPERN TO THE BAND, HER FAMILY.  DOES THE HIGH SCHOOL SHE WENT TO, FAMILY OR FRIENDS  HAVE ANY OF HER, DRAWING, PAINTINGS, PERHAPS SHE DID.
SHE WAS A BRIGHT STAR, IF ONLY SOMEONE COULD OF HELPED HER.

218155,5,6300183505,"This is an entertaining video - I was delighted to see the concert clips of Janis singing. I'm glad someone was recording her singing live in concert; it truly shows the powerful and passionate performer that she was.  However, I came away with the feeling that deep inside, Janis was really a sad person despite her success and free-spirit. This is evident in the interview at her high school reunion. One can also tell in the various interview clips whether she was on something, drunk, or straight.
Janis was truly a unique and gifted yet tormented woman who, to this date, no other singer can surpass. She embodied the spirit of the 60's and there will never be another like her. It's such a shame she died so young.",982800000,7,720,4.5813953488372094
218156,5,6300183505,"I find this film to be a piece of history all of in itself. The live footage is above all else. For example, the footage of Janis starring in the Dick Cavett show: the Full Tilt Boogie Band playing ""Move Over,"" is one of a very few chances of seeing this song actually filmed live. Of course, all of her music performed in this film, particularly when she sang ""Cry Baby"" and ""Tell Mama,"" is definately RAW,LOUD,AND LOOSE. She belt out those songs and was herself- no worries and no hesitation to speak her mind. The footage of Janis and the Kosmic Blues Band ""Kosmic Blues"" at Woodstock well illustrates why I consider this film as a piece of history. The studio outakes of Summertime and (briefly) ""Catch Me Daddy"" catches Janis and Big Brother and the Holding Company as their loose, unique selves.  All throughout the film, Janis is, like I said, RAW, LOUD, AND LOOSE. Translation: JANIS! Not to mention inspiring. Hopefully, music fans will agree.",977270400,17,952,4.666666666666667
218157,5,6300183505,"This is a fascinating documentary.  Those who read about Janis in ""Buried Alive"" will especially enjoy this movie, as the two compliment each other quite well.  For example, the high school reunion  scene in the movie takes on added meaning if you know what was going on  behind the scenes.  Musically, I believe the Full Tilt '70 footage is the  best in the movie.  Strangely, the order of the music footage in the film  is as follows:  '66, '67, '70, '68, '69.  In my opinion, the '69 footage is  the weakest, but the director  probably wanted to show the amazing contrast  between Janis in '67 and Janis in '70 by putting the film together as he  did.  The film of the recording of ""Cheap Thrills"" is great too.  It sure was fun to watch Janis fooling around a bit for the camera as a  take of ""Summertime"" that we just watched her make is played back  for her. Finally, I guarantee you'll get choked up when the photo montage  rolls at the end as ""Me and Bobby McGee"" plays.  Janis fan?  Buy  this video!",951955200,32,1008,4.364130434782608
218158,5,6300183505,"this documentary is great for the simple fact that you get to watch and hear janis perform and be interviewed. Its all we have. It true however that there is no insight into her personal or professional problems,and  some of the vocals are strained beyond all reasonable limits. At one point  during a concert in canada,she actually stumbles on stage,clearly drunk.  But all told,i have watched it 7 times and love it despite its  shortcomings. I have to reccomend it highly if only because we have no  other film/documentary focusing only on Joplin. Last words on subject,there  are some astonishing performances here. buy it.",950572800,12,627,4.980769230769231
218159,5,6300183505,"Because, as the previous viewer points out, this seems one of the few ways to see this material.  Janis in the recording studio is great because we get a chance to see the creative process of Janis with her best band Big  Brother.  I still hope that someday soon someone makes a documentary that  goes a little further and show us homes, friends and places special to  Joplin.  No matter what her troubles I feel affection for her and love her  music.",948758400,6,451,4.426829268292683
218160,5,6300183505,"Janis contains footage any Janis Joplin fan will appreciate. There are roughly a dozen killer live performances that really show how she belted out that emotion, including songs performed at Woodstock, Monterey Pop, and  the Dick Cavett Show. There are also alternate versions of a few songs,  such as a slightly different ""Summertime"". You get a glimpse into  the recording studio and even get to see clips from her ten-year high  school reunion. This video is worth every penny, especially since video of  Janis Joplin seems so scarce... all that I have found is Monterey Pop VHS,  Janis VHS, and the Woodstock DVD. Technically, I guess I could also count  American Pop.",935712000,32,672,4.946428571428571

218197,5,6300183505,"I was about 18/19 year's old when she busted out with Big Brother and 'Cheap Thrills'.  Then, I was a fan and followed her.  So, had a handle on her turbulent life, and knew it was not going to be a 'feel good' documentary.
BUT, this documentary throws it all out right at you - from young till the O.D.
Interviews with many, letters she'd written, films of her on + away from the stage and spotlight, all add to the impact of her story.  And all form together to suck you in more as it moves along.
When it ended, I was left with an strong feeling of sympathy for her, and an incredible feeling of sadness -  what a very sad lady she was, and the short life she had.
No wonder you could hear + feel her soul in her voice when she sang those bluesy numbers!
Anyone interested in her should absolutely get this, but just don't expect to be smiling + joyful inside when it ends.  A very sad + tragic life indeed.",1493251200,,910,4.089887640449438

218418,5,6300183505,"Janis Joplin has been the subject of many writings, interviews, and documentaries.  As such, the basic facts of her life are extremely well known.  She was born in 1943 in small, conservative, and insular Port Arthur, Texas.  She did not fit the accepted mold in either appearance or interests or ethics, and as time passed she became a target for everything from high school bullies to the local KKK.  Trips to nearby New Orleans fueled her interest in music in general and the blues in particular, and after several false starts she became part of the San Francisco music scene as a member of the band Big Brother and the Holding Company.  In 1967 the band appeared at The Monterey Pop Festivaland Janis Joplin was a star.  Three years later she was dead.

Directed by Amy J. Berg, JANIS: LITTLE GIRL BLUE doesnt really add to our store of knowledge about Joplin for the simple reason that Joplin has been so exhaustively documented.  Even so, it is an extremely well-made, extremely watchable revisit to one of the most explosive, and most fleeting, talents of the 1960s.  There are new interviews with people ranging from Dick Cavette to Kris Kristofferson, and the film gains power by using excerpts from letters Joplin wrote to her familybut ultimately the great power here comes from Janis Joplin herself, performing live.  If nothing else, this documentary reminds of how remarkable Joplin was.  There was no one like her before she came on the scene, and while she influenced many, there has been no one like her since her death.  She is indeed a unique talent, and JANIS: LITTLE GIRL BLUE bears testimony to that fact.

There are also people that keep those legacies alive, via a music compilation, documentaries, etc. Amy J. Berg, who was nominated for an Academy Award for previous work (Deliver Us from Evil), is one of those people. The precious and captivating Janis  Little Girl Blue keeps alive the memory Janis Joplin, one of blues most remembered vocalists ( and rock & roll, for that matter).

Berg makes it easy for us, and basically takes us through Joplins life in an organized and chronological fashion, beginning in Port Arthur, Texas, where she was born on January 19, 1943. It was there that she began singing the blues, with the Waller Creek Boys. The filmmaker also uses drawings and photos from Janis scrapbook, which gives us a glance on her sad and, at times, tormented life. For example, some idiots in some university voted her the most ugly man, causing her a lot of grieve. Living in such a close-minded community made her move to San Francisco, where she felt much freedom, and where she began experimenting with drugs. It was there, apparently, that she met Bob Dylan and told him that one day she was going to be famous, to which he supposedly answered, Yes, we are all going to be famous. From then on, the film goes into the time that she spent with Big Brother & Holding Company, her famous performance at Monterrey in 1967, the recording of the seminal Cheap Thrills, her time as band leader with the Kosmic Blues Band, her interviews with Dick Cavett, her performance at Woodstock, her trip to Rio de Janeiro, and much more. We listen to the testimonies of Laura Joplin (sister), Michael Joplin (brother), Dave Getz, Peter Albin, and Sam Andrew (Big Brother Holding Company band members), Bob Weir (Grateful Dead), Clive Davis (legendary Columbia Records president), Joe McDonald (County Joe and the Fish), Kris Kristofferson (actor, composer, and singer), Snooky Flowers (Kosmic Blues Band), and others. In fact, Kristofferson was co-author of ""Me and Bobby McGee,"" Joplins biggest single.

Janis Joplin, who died on October 4, 1970, belongs to that generation in which we lost Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix and others, at such a young age  all drugs or booze related. It was a special and powerful generation, represented by rebellious youth that needed rebellious idols. They certainly left a mark and I argue that they made the world temporarily better. Janis  Little Girl Blue is a great document to remember one of our top female singers of all time. The DVD also includes the remaining Big Brother members singing acapella, Hollywood walk of fame ceremony, and more. (USA, 2015, color and B&W, 105 plus additional materials)

Though its great to hear musicians express themselves with passion, I always found her vocal style too manic and over-the-top. That being said, I did enjoy this film and it made me want to seek out at least one of her albums, and not just the greatest hits one either.

Using old letters back home as the storytelling device was brilliant to get a deeper understanding of Joplins psyche as was the choice to track down a former beau which really gives the view some insight into her domestic side, really fleshing her out as a person to those who only know of Janis the icon. Great home-movie footage too in the studio and on tour. FOUR STARS. Not that I will be watching it again anytime soon, but I did enjoy it and will be lending it to friends who will love it.",1466899200,,1001,4.268421052631579
218442,4,6300183505,"I rented this through Vudu and watched it on Netflix and found the quality on both channels good, or as good as you can get with the formats they had to work with.  I do plan on buying the blue ray since I feel this is well worth owning.

I will start with the pros on this documentary:  Janis was a complex person even from a little girl and I feel they got that point across very well.  Amy Berg I feel gives us a glimpse into Janis life starting out as a rebellious child, even more rebellious teen.  She kind of tip toes around the drug issues, and many don't know that Janis was never a junkie.  She did do drugs, but alcohol was her choice more than any drug.  Janis was influenced by others around her, notably Peggy Caserta who supplied Janis with heroin many times when Janis herself was trying to kick it.  I loved how Cat Power narrated the letters.  She certainly had that Texan drawl and I could believe it was Janis actually talking.  I loved hearing band members, friends and of course family notably her sister Laura and brother Michael talking about her and you could see how much they loved her in the way they still talked about her.  Janis sometimes said she was hated by her family and was kicked out when that was a lie.  She left home on her own free will and was always welcomed back when she needed to come home.  I loved the interviews, especially the Dick Cavett interview, who flirted with her and she flirted right back, and yes I think he flirted  more with her then she with him!!  I liked the scenes in the studio.  Janis had a lot to say with how she wanted things to sound.  She didn't just sit by and let the guys do it.  These are things about Janis that few knew.  She was a warm, funny and intelligent  person.  I do feel that it got that across.

Cons: the tip toeing around the drug and alcohol abuse.  It was talked about, but for me not enough.  It was a big part of who she was and no she was not high all the time, but she did love to drink and do drugs once in a while.  I do believe Amy Berg did this on purpose because the family did not want to dwell on it and Laura is very protecting of Janis.  Even in Lauras book she doesnt talk about it as much as you think.  Like it or not, its what killed her and what people want to know is why and how I do think more bios explain it better than this movie did.  Even Lauras book did more.  I wish they had more concert footage.  You got some full songs, but not the Monterey one where she sang Ball n chain and that was good quality footage.  That whole song shouldve been in the movie.  It disappointed me it was not.  But they put the sloppy but still great Woodstock one in?  She was not at her best in that footage.  This is why I took the one star off.  There was a lot left out that couldve been told.

The best part of this movie is how they show Janis as not only a singer and entertainer, but as human being with problems that she overcame, love she had a hard time keeping but did experience and the talent and voice that no one will ever be able to copy.  45 years after her death, she is still noted as one, if not the best, female singer ever and thats saying something.  There will never be another Janis.  We only wish she was still with us.",1466726400,,3248,4.069510268562401

218446,5,6300183505,"LOVED This Documentary! The psychedelic colors really looked vibrant. It showcases Janis Joplin's life through her own words using letters she had written to her family and interviews she had done. They also talk to those closest to Janis to get an inside look at her life and what was going on in her mind.  From being treated badly in high school to how Port Arthur, Texas residents treated her. She felt a lot of sadness and felt the sadness of others so I would consider her an empath. It was this empathy, sadness, and stress of being famous that led to her abuse of drugs which ultimately led to her untimely death.

218452,5,6300183505,"Janis Joplin was at turns an iconoclast who thumbed her nose at society and convention who also desperately wanted to be loved by everybody or at the very least one good man.  Some would say she was depressive suffering from esteem issues while at the same time embracing life wholeheartedly.  This is the enigma that was the woman who remains the standard bearer for female rockers who came before and after her.  It's ironic because Janis was only in the spotlight for a few years and didn't have the accompanying musicians until her final album to match her prodigious talents.  The question is does director Amy J. Berg succeed in detailing the contradictions that were Janis?  Through a series of archival interviews with Janis, letters written by her, performance footage as well as interviews with band mates, family, friends and sundry acquaintances I think she does.  As many questions are answered as left unanswered but it is the job of a good, nay responsible, documentarian to allow their audience to sift through the information they've gathered and form their own opinion.  The train metaphor that Berg employs throughout the film is lost on me, though.  This film will give you a new understanding of Janis and leave you a little sad even though you already knew the tragic outcome.  On a personal note it's many a time I went into a bar and put ""Me and Bobby McGee"" on the jukebox just to hear Janis sing the immortal refrain ""Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose"".  I know Kris Kristofferson wrote it but I don't think he would deny that Janis owns it.",1466294400,10,1586,4.734545454545454

My (slightly older) husband, who was actually at Woodstock and lived in the Bay Area during the Summer of Love, enjoyed it as much or more than I did.  It was historically accurate but personally touching.  I know we will watch it again and again.  I learned a lot by watching the movie (most of which my husband said he already knew), and it brought to life a person I never personally watched in concert but have always enjoyed on CD/iPod.

Because of the running time Im pretty sure (but not certain) that the AM version was edited for graphic language and some (a small amount) of nudity. The DVD is unedited and includes three bonus features (extended or deleted scenes) including one throwaway  the ceremony where Joplin gets a star in Hollywoods Walk of Fame. (She is represented by her brother and sister)

The film tells the life (a short one, sadly) of Janis Joplin through the words of those who played with her or had relationships with her and the words from her private (until now) letters (read by indie artist Cat Power). And there is a lot of great archival footage too.

Anyone who is a big fan of Joplin will want to see this and those who are curious as to her young life before she became a symbol of the 60s, and how (and maybe why) she died so long will find this worth their time. I sure learned a lot.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

218611,5,6300183505,"Janis Joplin is one of those singers that seems to come along once in a blue moon and seems to die tragically. I most recently watched the Amy Winehouse film and I was so emotionally drained after watching it. I was a huge Amy fan and felt that her talent just started to hit the surface as to how big she could have become. Watching this film and being so emotionally invested in Janiss music, this documentary hit me like a ton of emotional bricks. Amy Bergs documentary captures what made Janis so special but yet so disturbingly raw. Like most people, Pearl was what turned me onto this woman and her 60s R&B like vocals. Joplin like most musicians who hit the scene with a fury died at 27 years old of a heroin overdose. This film covers the two sides of the coin, the young woman who was growing up by the day and this adult woman whose voice just won over anyone who listened. Like Winehouse, both were 27 and both were not ready for what was coming. Where Winehouse could not handle the demons that invaded her life, Joplin was more of a toxic cocktail of the fame and celebrity she became and achieved.

We also learned that Joplins demons were not family or paparazzi related but school related. She suffered from verbal abuse from classmates. The hippie persona was born out of a rejection that she felt from her peers. This documentary just really tells a story that most people can relate to,and others would never want to relate towards. You have someone who had a gift when she exposed the world to that gift, she was consumed and she wanted to show people that she was someone. The sadness of this documentary is the character study and watching Janis in her years and seeing her life (as short as it was) just sort of become her own enemy. It is the classic case of being on the outside and realizing what is going on, more than the people on the inside. I have every compilation and cd the woman has ever made, and I would have loved to see her live outside of the computer or television set. Janis captured what the 70s were all about, and she will always be a one of a kind performer. I will recommend this film very highly, along with the Amy Winehouse one and also the Joy Division documentary that came out a few years ago. They are all three very cutting edge, brutally honest and heartfelt shot. This was truly the day that the music died, Pearl we love you. She would have been so proud of this film I feel.",1462147200,22,2433,4.347252747252747

218614,3,6300183505,"JANIS JOPLIN: LITTLE GIRL BLUE follows a familiar narrative (also employed in 2015's ANY) of the exceptionally talented female star catapulted into the limelight, who could not handle it, and eventually killed herself accidentally of a heroin overdose at the age of 28.

All the familiar ingredients were there; the middle-class upbringing In Port Arthur, Texas, where Joplin became something of a rebel against her rather insular family, and expressed her rebellion by acting in increasingly mannish ways. Although she believed herself to be accepted into a largely male society, she found herself victim of a series of reversals, including being elected the ""ugliest man"" in a group of people in Austin, Texas.

Eventually she decamped to San Francisco, where she joined a band (Big Brother) and eventually acquired the recognition she had craved ever since childhood. The narrative followed a predictable live: in the end she became too big for her band, branched out on her own, enjoyed some major successes both in the United States as well as abroad, founded a new band, consolidated her stardom and was just about to embark on exciting new possibilities when death eventually struck her.

Accompanied by reminiscences from those closest to her, as well as members of her own family, JANIS JOPLIN: LITTLE GIRL BLUE told the story of a phenomenally talented person unable to reconcile personal with professional lives. She could not stand being alone when offstage; and tried to find solace in heroin. It seemed that for all their love of the singer (some of the interviewees started crying as they recalled the tragic sides of her life), no one actively lifted a finger to help her psychologically.

Accompanied by extensive footage of her in performance, together with readings from her private letters, Amy J. Berg's documentary had a certain fascination for anyone interested in her music. But for the uninitiated viewer it seemed to be wearyingly predictable.",1461456000,6,1969,5.163009404388715

218639,5,6300183505,"I will say up front that I am a fan of Janis Joplin and looked forward to seeing this (on the BBC) it details her life in chronological order from her days growing up in Port Arthur, Texas to her many incarnations with all of her bands including Big Brother and the Holding Company.

There are interviews with friends, lovers and family. There is plenty of archive footage but only snippets of songs which includes the Monterey Pop appearance. Many songs are featured but the real reason here is to tell her story and her battles with drugs and alcohol and her of love of the blues, which she could sing so beautifully that even watching this I felt the hairs on the back of my neck rising.

It is amazing how she managed to put so much emotion and passion into her music and it seems the people around it saw that in her too. Her firmament burnt for too short a time but while it did so it was also one of the brightest and most loved. I truly think this is a great tribute to Janis Joplin  not just the star but the person  highly recommended.",1460764800,3,1045,4.236180904522613

218692,4,6300183505,"Janis: Little Girl Blue was a surprisingly moving film. I had always had this image of Janis being a tough cookie, this shows her to be tender-hearted, a small town Texas girl who hung around with the boys, a bit of a tomboy, very shy and introverted. One year she was classed as ugliest man an annual tradition, which upset her deeply. She was never invited to the High School Prom, had no conventional beauty, was badly bullied at school, she stuck out like a sore thumb. She found an outlet in singing and playing guitar ,enjoying the blues. Born to a devoutly religious family in Port Arthur, Texas, Joplin always lived a little bit outside of the mainstream.

She felt a need to distinguish and express herself and migrated to San Francisco, where she joined Big Brother and the Holding Company, a psychedelic rock group whose groovy sound perfectly showcased her soulful, unique voice. She wanted to integrate herself into their sound. She didn't just sing a song, she gave herself 100%, heart and soul. Their recording  Piece of my Heart became legendary. She sang and became famous at the Monterey Pop Festival. She wore her hair long and clothing loose, embodying the rebelliousness of the counter-culture life-style. She outgrew her band and formed her own bands, Kozmic Blues Band the Full Tilt Boogie Band.

She gave magnetic performances, but fuelled by drugs and alcohol, to which she was addicted. She played Woodstock, performing songs like Work Me, Lord and Ball and Chain. When she relaxed a little, especially when she went to Brazil, she fell in love, but her boyfriend wasn't able to take the heroin addiction and left. She attempted to kick the habit and did so for a while. But she became increasingly forlorn when she realized her band mates had families to go back to, while she was alone. There are many excerpts of her in conversation with her band-mates or in sessions. She is also shown having taken an acid-laced drink unknowingly, while off heroin.

The film shows her wanting to make it big abroad and she had a great sold-out concert at the Royal Albert Hall. What drove her was the love and fan worship she received from the audience. Beneath the gritty, storming performances the film portrays the little girl lost, wanting love and stability. However, love don't come easy. She paid the price for her legacy, her voice was her only transcendence. She fell back on heroin and died of a drug-overdose, being one of the celebrity casualties along with Brian Jones and Jimmy Hendrix of rocknroll.

Amy Bergs superb, poignant documentary captures the awkward individual beneath the feminist icon, caught up in the rocknroll patriarchy. Fellow southerner Cat Power gives voice to Joplins innermost thoughts via her letters, at once both brash and cripplingly lonely, while archive performance footage reminds us how exquisite her molasses-strained through wire-wool delivery could be. The film allows us to engage with her as a human being first and a musical icon second. Berg grounds her film in Joplins emotional realm without allowing us to see the doom ahead. Her brilliance was born from her own pathological inability to discern it.",1459036800,6,3169,4.904850746268656

Some classmates were very mean in what they said about her. I never knew she went through so much angst in her lifetime  The movie depicted her life as having many ups and downs.

Pennebaker's subsequent filming of her studio and live performances (after his stunning film of her at 1967 Monterey Pop), along with his personal impressions of Janis add context to her story.

218868,4,6300183505,"Nostalgia has no limit, no limits, absolutely none. It is in fact the frontier to dreams and the future, no matter how you look at it. With no nostalgia there is no imagination  nothing new under the sun except new assembly of old, eternal, ever present emotions.

And emotional you have to be and get with this invocation of Janis Joplin.

It was the dense and tumultuous time of Fritz the Cat (1972) and Zabriskie Point (1970). Three great artists and performers among the most innovative minds of their time, Jimi Hendrix (1942-1970), Janis Joplin (1943-1970) and Otis Redding (1941-1967) died, two of an overdose and one in a plane crash. What a loss.

The only woman in that triad, who was not the first woman in rock-and-roll in  spite of what is said in the film, was the direct white heiress of blues, jazz and black music, all represented by Aretha Franklin (1942-and still living and kicking, and even making Obama wax sentimental in public) who was a black woman in this field before Janis Joplin. The film does mention her and the fact she was the model, the inspirational muse of Janis Joplin, which made Janis Joplin second in this music, even if she was the first white woman.

What did Janis Joplin contribute to the world of modern amplified polyrhythmic music? A lot, indeed a lot, even more than just a plain lot.

She had very hard, realistic and powerful lyrics that exposed society the way it was felt and suffered by young people in the 1960s and early 1970s. She had a singing style and voice that were unique at the time among women and first of all white women singers. She was possessed in her music by hope for sure, but with the conscious certainty that this hope would be betrayed, and it was of course, naturally and without any failure. We can always count on one thing from this rotten world we live in: it will betray our hope, our hopes and even our plain submissive obedient and subservient wishes. And betrayal is the major master word of this hell of a life we have to live through. In spite of the flashes of bliss from time to time when an emotion is responded to emotionally, when our love is received and shared with pure love and not short term greed or lust.

It was betrayed by the use of drugs that made the hopeful forget the world cannot change in the proper direction, in the direction of human freedom, if you exit it by artificial means into virtual dreams of psychedelic freedom that turned into nightmares, like in the film More (1969) or those I have already quoted. That means the world can only change in the proper direction if you remain conscious and united towards that objective that you in no way control but onto the outcome of which you can weigh and even be of some influence by making your collective parameter heavier in front of the millions of other parameters that dictate history. Janis Joplin could be one of those who mobilized millions of individuals into pushing history in the right direction, which did not mean left or right, but right and not wrong.  In the countries where they twinned up right with left and not wrong, they were made the slaves of decisions taken by others and of cosmic phenomena beyond any human control.

Betrayed it was by the use of violence and here the film is silent about the Black Panthers and their being systematically killed by the dozens in Chicago or other places. And thats what one should only care about in that period: the systematic repression of any protest around and after 1968. No allusion to the assassination of Martin Luther King and Senator Robert Kennedy. No mention of the Vietnam War and the millions of people killed or maimed over there in the name of democracy and freedom for  and only for  the Americans and maybe here and there the West reduced to its anticommunism of Mathuselahs ancient times. And that was then Good Morning Vietnam (1987) that will take twenty years or so to come out of its Pandoras box of napalm and other green berets adventures, capers, brutality and barbarity.

 Betrayed by all sorts of crooked, more or less crooked, rather more than less crooked, politicians from A.B. Johnson to Richard Nixon, via Spiro Agnew; and Ronald Reagan was just in the near future. There the worst part is that this systematically warped democracy enables the majority of those who want tranquility and no disruption in their everyday life and comfort, be they favorable to change or not, to always have the last word. The last reform of importance was the 26th amendment lowering voting age from 21 to 18, ratified in 1971, though not the lowering of drinking age and a few other age limits of that type, like being able to enter the music saloons or music bars on Bourbon Street in New Orleans and many other places where the best music was performed. It did not change anything in the logic of the political system, hence the social dependence we all cling to. And Nixon was reelected in 1972 by all these young 18, 19 and 20 year old voters. The debate was raging about this lowering of voting age from what I remember when Janis Joplin was at the highest point of her stardom just when she decided to OD in a motel room, alone.

You can make a star out of a person but that persons solitude is even greater than before because stars are NOT dancing together. And whats more these stars are black stars and we all know what happens to black stars that could be starry star-like black holes.

So Janis Joplin ODed once, though she could not do it a second time even if she wanted to, and the star got extinguished by some stampeding Horse. Did it change the face of the world? Of course not. We are so inconsequential in this cosmos!

While watching Janis Joplin sing with all the soul and heart needed to sell practically anything is a delight, I really wanted more insight into who she was as an artist and as a human being.  Instead I was merely shown a few short interviews spliced between concert performances.  There is no depth here, unless you read between the lines of her music (which tells a very strong story and yet just isn't enough here).  If you want to experience her music, raw and unfiltered then I suggest seeking this out, but if you want a true documentary on the life and times of Janis Joplin then you are going to be disappointed here.",1388448000,4,738,4.404411764705882

219011,4,6300183505,"How disappointing that this remarkable performance film is not currently on DVD (in North America anyway).

What's notable about JANIS is that while it's billed as a documementary,  it really IS a performance film (mainly).  After Janis died in 1970, there was so much analysis over WHO she was and WHAT she meant, but the subtitle to this film (at least for the video version is simply ""THE WAY SHE WAS,"" and after all the verbiage that proliferated in the early to mid-70s, it turns out that the best way to find out ""how she was"" really is to see her in her performance--and while it's truly unfortunate that there really all that much performance footage available from Janis' relatively short career, the filmmakers managed to assemble much of the best available stuff for this 1974 classic rock'n'roll film.

So, yeah, it's technically a documentary, and the interview segments give you additional insight into Janis' personage AND persona, the assumption is that the viewer pretty much KNOWS most of that stuff anyway.  Do you need someone else telling you that beneath that tough exterior was a (hyper)sensitive interior?  I doubt it.  In the intervening years, the ""mean mean mama"" of a tune like ""Turtle Blues"" has become inextricably mingled with the ""Little Girl Blue.""  Actually, it was ever thus.  The trick was how those tensions all played out on stage and in the recording studio.  It was in her performances that all her contradictions came out and blended seamlessly, for the most part.

Interesting too that the clips from her final months show Janis to be in good voice, for the most part, and reasonably energized onstage.  One of the reasons her management supposedly refused to have the existing footage of her Woodstock performance (a bit more than a year before her death) included in the documentary of the same name was that her performance was iffy at best. (Some say she was strung out.)  The clips included here show her perhaps not at her absolute best, but solid enough.  I don't know how many bands you could say were in absolute top form at that event.  And at the time, inspired performances seemed to be almost beside the point--when what was INSPRIRATIONAL (allegedly) was just being there.

As for the Full Tilt Boogie clips from her final year, well, it has been stated that that group WAS tight and, in many ways, the most technically proficient of all her three bands.  Still some of the live tracks that surfaced in audio form on the posthumous JOPLIN IN CONCERT album showed considerable vocal strain.  Turns out that some of the video included in the film is from the exact same performances (the Canadian train tour) and with the visual to augment the performances, you'd swear she was in rare form.  So she can't quite duplicate live the scathing wails from the studio version of ""Try,"" for instance.  She's working the band--and the audience--and ultimately making it WORK.

Back in the late 60s, it would have been next to impossible to do a film of a single concert.  The marketing of packaging an entire show on film or video seems to have mainly come about only later--as a by-product of the home video revolution.  In format, JANIS really isn't all THAT different from WOODSTOCK, MONTERREY POP or MAD DOGS AND ENGLISHMEN, say.  It is basically a compilation of various performances, some on stage some from television, tacked together in less-than-strict chronologial order.

But since it was compiled posthumously, there may well have been a temptation to do interview segments with, I dunno, people like Chet Helms or Sam Andrew--or more peripheral figures in Janis' life (like Grace Slick, say) or maybe people you'd never heard of but who claimed to be close like publicist/biographer Myra Friedman.  Wisely, they avoided that trap.  By 1974, I think people were all talked out (and had heard enough) about Janis' troubled life and hard times.  What they needed a sense of was what was it about her live performances that was so magic.

If it can't quite capture the magic of an actual live performance, this film at least gives the contemporary audience a clue as to what all the fuss was all about.  And it does a pretty good job of it.  Kudos to filmmakers Howard Alk and Seaton Findley for taking the mainly-music approach.  It may not tell the whole story.  But it does pretty much show you ""the way she was.",1351296000,,4370,4.791722296395194
219012,4,6300183505,"Amazing live performances captured on film are the reason to see to see this.

The interviews with Janis don't reveal much, and there's no real sense of her history. Even the stage stuff is shot pretty straightforwardly, but, man-o-man could she sing!

One wonderful thing is that a lot of the numbers are uncut, allowed to go their full length, which, with Janis in concert, could easily be 8 minutes or more. The power, the emotion, the energy, the sexiness, the sweet sense of fun she brought to the stage could only be hinted at on her albums. For those reasons it's more than worth sitting through the slightly homogenized off-stage material.

It awful to think that this is essentially unavailable.  Time for a decent DVD re-release!",1276560000,2,739,4.7952755905511815

219014,5,6300183505,"This film chronicles the life and times, of singer Janis Joplin.  She was one of the most important rock icon, of the 60s. And not only because of her incredibly intense singing style, but also because Janis lived life on her own terms. No other female rock singer before Janis, ever conveyed the blistering, fierce emotions, that were typical of her stage performances.

The film shows Janis in several live performances, over the course of her career. Including her spectacular performances on the Dick Cavette Show, at Woodstock, the Montery Pop Festival, etc.  Much of this movie also includes several interviews, with Janis herself.  She speaks frankly about why she chose to be a singer, her relationship with her family, and her difficulties growing-up in her ultraconservative hometown, Port Arthur, Texas.

Janis is even shown attending her High school reunion in Port Arthur, after she becomes famous. She felt vindicated afterwards.
Those who had humiliated her when she was in High school, were
clamoring to suck-up to her, when she attended her reunion. This film included footage of Janis rehearsing and recording, with the
bands that she sang with; Big Brothet & The Holding Company, The Kosmic Blues Band, and The Full-Tilt Boogie Band.  She had her ups and downs with her band members; Big Brother felt that Janis deserted them, when she decided to leave the band.

Janis had a reputation for being this tough chick, who was hard-drinking, loud, foul-mouthed, and displaying a raunchy, uninhibited  sexuality. But, as the interviews with her revealed, Janis was also a sensitive and intelligent young woman. And she exuded an aching, emotional vulnerability. Beneath her veneer of bravado, Janis had the same insecurities as the rest of us.

Just listening to Janis talk is very plesant since you get the feeling that she was a hurting sole deep down but extremely intelligent as well.

The photos were tiny, but I marvelled at a woman who looked to be wailing like a wild animal - hair frizzy and flying, mouth open wide enough to swallow the rest of the 8 X 10 book! Then my first experience of hearing her voice was in 1980 - I heard 'Move Over' on the radio one Sunday lunchtime, and I could not continue eating my food! I hadn't heard a woman sound like that and I was enthralled. Then this film was shown on TV here in the UK and I finally saw Janis in action.

Some of her greatest hits are featured here (""Ball and Chain,"" ""Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)"" and ""Move Over,"" among others).  There really was never anyone quite like Janis, and there never will be.  She had a combination of fiery sexuality, heartwrenching lyrics and the ability to deliver songs filled with feeling and passion, at times, even wailing the lyrics.

And little Janis found out she could sing. Even bluegrass. Janis and some friends got to Los Angeles. A new world. Music. Nice people. You didn't have to be a babe. It was 1964. Back and forth, Janis traveled from Texas to California, back and back again. She went to San Francisco. She started singing in little bars. She smoked pot. She had a few drinks. The big break for Janis Joplin was the Summer of Love, 1967, 50 years ago. It was the Monterey Pop Festival. Boom. Janis became a star at age 25. A whole new world. Janis found out she was happy on a stage singing the blues. And all those kids sitting out there listening. They were happy too....""Janis. Little Girl Blue"" is a sad, beautiful rock-and-roll love story. So well done. So real. Interviews and scenes with Jerry Garcia, John Lennon, Bill Graham, and TV talk-show host Dick Cavett. And more. Her friends. Her lovers. Her managers. She could not know that the road would be short. Blasting out at Woodstock and the Avalon BallRoom, little Janis could not know that she would join the ""27 Club"", a list of famous artists would died at age 27(Hendricks, Morrison, and Janis). ""Janis. Little Girl Blue"" is a rare documentary, a true story of a sad little fat girl, who did good. And then saw it all fade away. A tear will come into your eye. You'll realize that life is short. But it's a gift. A gift to be alive.",1509667200,,1724,4.324074074074074
