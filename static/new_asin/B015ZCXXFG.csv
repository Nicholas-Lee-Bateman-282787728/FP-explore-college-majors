8735163,4,B015ZCXXFG,"""The People vs. Fritz Bauer"" (2015 release from Germany; 105 min., original title ""Der Staat gegen Fritz Bauer"") brings the dramatic retelling of the circumstances within which Hesse Attorney General Bauer prosecuted former Nazis in post- WWII Germany. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Frankfurt in the late 1950s"", and we get to know Fritz Bauer. In the opening scene he almost drowns in his bath tub (an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, it turns out). But the incident has caused concern with others. One of Bauer's State Attorneys (i.e. more junior prosecutor) invites Bauer to the country side. ""Do you like to hunt?"" he asks, to which Bauer replies ""Yes, but not animals"", ha! Indeed Bauer is working feverishly to track down Adolf Eichmann. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is NOT a bio-pic of Fritz Bauer. Indeed, we get little to no background information as to his life prior to 1957 or after 1960 (starting and closing points of the movie). In a way, this is unfortunate, as an unsuspecting viewer may not fully realize the importance of this man in German politics. Second, the movie's central theme that ""the people"" or ""the state"" (as the original German title reads) is against Bauer is somewhat misleading. It's really the German political establishment, which was riddled at the time with former Nazis, which tries to stifle Bauer's efforts. This theme was something of a taboo in Germany for decades following WWII. Just last year there was another German movie, also involving Bauer, called ""Labyrinth of Lies"", which also addressed this. Thirdly, strictly from a film viewing perspective, the production is rather ""dry"" and at times it feels like watching a European TV drama. But I nevertheless enjoyed it quite a bit. Last, the movie also spends quite a bit of time looking at one of Bauer's closest aides, State Attorney Angermann. At the end of the movie, there are some announcements about what became of Bauer. But inexplicably nothing is said about what became of Angermann. Not sure how that could've happened (and leading me to deduct a further 1/2 star from my overall rating).

""The People vs. Fritz Bauer"" opened this weekend without any pre-release advertising or hype at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (1 person besides myself), which is a shame. Hopefully this is the type of movie that will find a larger audience once it gets exposure on Amazon Instant Video, and eventually is released on DVD/Blu-ray. If you are in the mood for a true historical drama about an important episode of German politics post -WWII, I can readily recommend that you check this out.",1476835200,2,2878,4.847560975609756
8735164,4,B015ZCXXFG,"""The State versus Fritz Bauer"" is a German movie, with English subtitles. It is the bio pic of German judge and prosecutor Fritz Bauer, an official in West German state of Hesse, who wanted to bring ex-Nazis to justice in the post-WW2 years. He was also a Jew, who may have been gay. Bauer is most famous for leading the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials in the early to mid 1960's. But he was also involved in the hunt for Adolf Eichmann and worked with Israel's Mossad in their identification and capture of Eichmann. (An excellent book on the mission from the Israeli view is ""The House on Garabaldi Street"", by Isser Harrel.) This movie is about the Eichmann search and capture, rather than the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials, which are briefly alluded to in the movie.

The movie is a very good rendering of Fritz Bauer and the machinations of the post-war legal and financial circles in post-war Germany. With many ex-Nazis and Nazi sympathisers involved in the government, Bauer's office in Frankfurt seemed to be a cauldron of non-cooperation and downright ratf*****g at all levels. The movie shows this, but also is sympathetic with Bauer's stated hope that the post-war generation will do the right thing and uncover the poisoned layer in society.

The problem with the movie - and I can't quite figure out why it was put in - is the subplot of Fritz Bauer's sexual preferences and those of one of his assistants. Post-war Germany still had on its books a law - Article 175 - which made the act of homosexuality a criminal offense, punishable by jail time. Bauer's assistant - fictional character called ""Karl Angermann"" - had gender conflicts - he was married but was gay - and the movie shows Hessian officials who were able to get at Bauer through Angermann. As a viewer, I'm not sure why the story of Fritz Bauer and his fight to Nazi prosecution wasn't enough of a story to be filmed. The movie was billed as a ""bio-pic"", but is it really?

But ""The State vs Fritz Bauer"" is a well-made and engrossing movie. I can recommend it and I wish there was more to read on the main character.

EDIT: Please know that I am reviewing the movie itself and not the technical aspects of the DVD. In the theater, where I saw the movie in the United States, there were English subtitles. In the description of the DVD for sale here on Amazon, it doesn't say there are English subtitles. I suppose I would err on the side of caution and assume there aren't subtitles. Best if you know German if you want to view this movie outside the theater...",1473120000,3,2533,4.584988962472406
