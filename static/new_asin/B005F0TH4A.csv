8469410,3,B005F0TH4A,Could have included more about vampires.  The first video on vampires was laughable.  Its just a collection if lost tape episodes.  Not serious documentary,1425254400,,155,5.375
8469411,3,B005F0TH4A,Interesting!,1421539200,,12,12.0
8469412,4,B005F0TH4A,"I loved it; this movie is almost unquie in dividing the plot line of werewolves and vampires, with two special episodes from Lost Tapes. It also offers a glimpse in those legendary monsters' long history since the Dark Age's beginning to today...",1412035200,,246,4.880952380952381
8469413,5,B005F0TH4A,"Wish that ""werewolves the dark history"" had either become a show or was fleshed out to a movie and played in theaters that is all I bought it for and I git more than my $ worth.",1389484800,,177,3.810810810810811
8469414,4,B005F0TH4A,"The Dvd was pretty good. But the vampire part could of used less sexual theories on Bram Stoker,and more on vampire history and lore. The rest was pretty good.",1360368000,,159,4.517241379310345
8469415,2,B005F0TH4A,"This has four features on it (4 segments) that are informative, but fall short of being anything memorable or intriguing. I was expecting something a bit more ""realistic"" and science based, but this DVD focused more on the myths that we have all heard before. One of the two Werewolf features seems to be composed entirely of fiction/dramatized footage using actors. The story plays like a bad B-Movie and is not what I was looking for at all. I really don't understand the point of including this segment on the DVD. There are a few tid-bits of info that I hadn't known before, but I'd say skip this or perhaps find a way to see it without blowing the $$. I wish I had something better to say, as I was looking forward to seeing it when I found it at the book store. Oh well.",1322352000,4,776,4.321917808219178
