8655963,5,B00K5EJF3Y,"As an offspring of one of those ""hard cases"" where many people offered to pay for my mother's abortion, she and I are very happy with the life I've made for myself and I'm extremely proud of her for the tough decisions she has made. So having a documentary that gives a voice to those who actually have been in the hard case situations and made the 'choice' for life is refreshing and I'm very thankful that this dvd is available to those of us who want to share the other side of the story :)",1498694400,,493,4.145833333333333
