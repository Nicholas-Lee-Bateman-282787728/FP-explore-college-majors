Grab you cup of tea and put on your shawl, get ready for a great movie experience .",1178496000,,311,4.2

For anyone who isn't a child, this movie is going to be painful to watch.  Painful enough, though, that it is redeemable for the humor of inflicting it upon friends.

We've since shown Cutest Cat Capers to several of our buddies, all of whom have begged us to shut it off.  Needless to say, we take an almost sadistic glee in not acceeding to their pleas.

All in all, I'd say this video is excellent for small children who love cats, but the entertainment value for adults is virtually nonexistant - except perhaps laughing at the production values.",1121817600,,691,4.488
7910530,5,B00000ICBU,"The film Cutest Cat Capers is simply a triumph. It chronicles the life of 23 American cats and one cougar. On the surface Cutest Cat Capers might look like a superficial story about over privileged kittens but underneath lies the sparkling diamond that is Cutest Cat Capers. As with Carrie Hamilton in Tokyo Pop (Spectra Films, 1988) Cutest Cat Capers succeeds in warming your innards. The plot follows the pursuit of happiness of a kitten whom throughout the film remains nameless, thus symbolizing the everyman.

 The cats indulge themselves in many pleasures such as the fine arts, minority study, ancient Egyptian culture, cinema and architecture. But deep inside it is evident that the cats of Cutest Cat Capers are not happy with such a lifestyle. Thought they are ""cute"" on the outside, it is apparent that they are tortured on the inside by the looming shadow of death. You see, the animals in Cutest Cat Capers resided in Evvansdael County Animal Shelter and the lives they led were nowhere near as glamorous as they were on the screen, reflecting the faade that we put up in our everyday life. Any person can relate to the turmoil that the cats in Cutest Cat Capers endure.

 The single cougar represents our greatest generation and the resiliency of human nature (or in this case, cat nature (-: ) The cougar's singularity in Cutest Cat Capers reflects that this generation is dying and resembles the strength of a cougar but the heart of a lion*.

 Some of the points discussed in this review may not be apparent to those who watched only the VHS version of Cutest Cat Capers as available on amazon.com. If you make the trip to the Evvansdael County Animal Shelter you can purchase the DVD version with director commentary by Steve Cantin and other special features (Including a 20 minute interview with conceptual artists Jack Jensen and Chris Vassaux.)

(You will be happy to know that 22 of the 23 cats in Cutest Cat Capers were adopted and given loving homes, with the exception one whom after fighting a long battle with feline leukemia died heroically a year after the filming of Cutest Cat Capers. To learn more about feline leukemia contact your local animal shelter or find one of the many websites dedicated to fighting this disease.)

When the video broke from constant play, my toddler never stopped asking for a new one.  That was ten months ago.  Fortunately we found a replacement copy here.  Thank you Amazon!
Sincerely,
