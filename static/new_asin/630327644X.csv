7843845,5,630327644X,"By far the most convenient, thorough and effective workout program I have experienced.  Chris will motivate you to earn a level of physical fitness worthy of any sport.  Furthermore, Chris trains Mental Toughness throughout the workout and encourages you to safely exceed your expectations. When you master this program you will understand that ""The mind controls the body, the body does not control the mind"".",1463356800,,410,5.292307692307692
7843846,5,630327644X,"If you keep working out along with the tape, in six months I guarantee you will feel great and you will have the strength built in.  Not only that, your body will take shape and you will notice the muscles developing around your body.",1355443200,,234,4.318181818181818
7843847,4,630327644X,"Bit fast, but heck..he is a SEAL.

I have several of T.J's training tapes including the unarmed police officer tape. He is highly recommended.",1255651200,,142,4.916666666666667
7843848,5,630327644X,"From close up crotch shots to exercising with a knife in hand, this video has it all - except for an actual workout.  I watched this with a group of people and none of us has ever laughed so hard in our lives.  The camera work looks to be done by someone who just bought a VHS camera for the first time.  The backround machine guns are also hysterical.  The guy in the video is priceless - from his belch where he had to say ""excuse me"" to doing pullups on a childhood playset to the even more ridiculous line when he was doing arm circles - ""ya know what's funner than this?...NOTHING!"".  There is even a scene where it looks like he has a bra on because of the camera work.  Actually, the entire thing reminds me of Ben Stiller in DODGEBALL.  He must have based the character off this guy or something.

I think I burned alot of calories just laughing at this video nonstop.  The exercises are just basic stretching and pushups.  Unless you are looking for comedy, do not buy this.  HOwever, I rated this 5 stars because I think everyone should own this.",1172966400,2,1056,4.282828282828283
7843849,5,630327644X,"Let's start with a few negatives. The production values are bad and his presentation appears unscripted. However, that is exactly why this is the best excercise video I have ever seen!

There are no fancy bells and whistles. Just an intense, slightly strange, guy showing you how to get in shape. Caracci has that odd sense of humor that comes from a person who has seen and done a lot in service to his country and his comrades. This only adds, though, to the overall value of the video because he makes the hard work fun.

I hope that Amazon decides to carry his other videos...",1027382400,,580,4.462264150943396
7843850,5,630327644X,"Chris goes to length to tell you not just what to do, but why your are doing it.  I believe the intention of the video is to educate someone while taking them through a workout.  Chris has a pretty good sense of humor displayed throughout the video.  I suspect you will find yourself chuckling here and there.
It is a good workout and a great building block for your own fitness program.  It is probably the best video exploration of PT I have seen.  Certainly the first to make me laugh with the instructor and the first to explain why certain things are important.
If you progress beyond this tape, try the other tapes starring Chris.  Oh my.  If you can honestly do them all ... wow.",1017273600,,686,4.354330708661418
7843851,4,630327644X,"This is a very no-nonsense workout vid. And, the first time I watched it, I couldn't work out much because I was laughing so hard. In addition to getting in shape, you can entertain your friends by explaining what a  ""good morning, honey"" is. I wonder, however, why Carracci holds  back on the streching. There is no possible way that one could do the  things SEALs do and not be more flexible than that. If SEAL training is  really this inflexible, they might take up figure skating or gymnastics if  they don't like sore muscles. So stretch a little more and have a great  time with this one.",925516800,,594,4.453703703703703
7843852,5,630327644X,"C.J. Carracci has a lot of charisma and connects well with the viewer. He more than overcomes the shortcomings on the production values in this video. I also liked the fact that he did not allude to or dwell on his  SEALs background and experience.
Great workout tips from endurance  training, toning up,@muscle building.
I thought the SEAL background  props added humor to the whole thing.",925084800,3,390,4.878787878787879
7843853,5,630327644X,"The Navy Seal Workout starring Chris Caracci, a former seal and tactical  combat expert, shows us various basic seal calisthenic exercises for the  moderately fit. The workouts though simple consist of straight and  dive-bomber pushups,jumping jacks, and various stationary leg and stomach  workouts among other exercises. I liked the video, it gave me a good idea  on how to start a beginner/intermediate cardio workout without the fancy  gyms or styling cloths. Just simple exercises that can make you cry out  pain and get you in the best shape of your life. When your ready to move up  get The Navy Seal Burnout video, The Navy Seal Industrial Strenth video,  and if your really a fitness buff the The Navy Seal Deathwish video.  Remember the seal motto "" When you mess with the best, you die like  the rest."" Amen brother",920505600,4,826,4.828571428571428
