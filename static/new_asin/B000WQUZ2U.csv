8225188,5,B000WQUZ2U,"I found this DVD a few years ago at a Fun Party store for about $5, and have since been trying to find more information about it.  There are no credits, so searching for the actors wasn't an option, and the website listed on the back of the DVD case has nothing there.  It appears to be produced by Fun World Div., Easter Unlimited, Inc. Carle Place, NY 11514, as indicated on the case.

The DVD itself has a number of tutorials and ideas to decorate your house and yard for Halloween.  They go step-by-step in the building process, and include safety tips.  In addition to the two male instructors, there are two attractive costumed assistants to aide and model for each project.  Most of the projects are easy enough for anyone to accomplish.  There are a few advanced ones that will take a bit more planning, tools, and skill.  The presentation of the DVD, such as the layout and menus, is well done.  I particularly like the music played throughout the DVD; it's a catchy tune.

With Halloween being my favorite holiday, I find myself watching this all year round.  Seeing this gets me excited about the holiday, even when it's months away, and it also gets me feeling creative and motivated to go finish a current project.

I'd recommend this DVD to anyone that likes Halloween and Do-It-Yourself projects.  If you ever thought about decorating the house and yard, either for a Halloween party, to scare trick-or-treaters, or just to be festive, this DVD will be a welcome addition to your collection.  Try finding it in a party store, or one of those Halloween stores that pop up in empty store space in October.",1279929600,9,1618,4.611888111888112
