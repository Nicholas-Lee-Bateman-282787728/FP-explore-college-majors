I was so excited to find them on Amazon for such a great price. I have started watching them and found that I still love them. I have  shown some of these to a 31 y/o lady and she likes them to.

*48 - 24:47

*First of all, it should be noted that the second season set, even though it doesn't say so anywhere on it, not even on the disc art, also includes episode 48, the Season 3 premiere. Why, I'm not exactly sure, but who can complain about an extra episode?

Now, secondly, I know that the previous releases of Soap contained several syndicated cuts of episodes and music edits. Since I don't own those older sets, I don't have them to compare to these new ones, so someone out there with them, please compare your runtimes with the ones I've listed and we can figure out whether any of the episodes on this set are fuller versions thereby making this cheaper upgrade worth buying to those who own the older sets.

I don't know what was considered syndicated. It used to be 22 minutes and if that's the case, comparing that fact to the runtimes I've listed (which seem to imply many of these are uncut), I assume none of these are syndicated, but the syndicated cuts may have been longer than 22 minutes back when they first aired in repeats.

As far as the varied runtimes of the episodes, that may indicate there are music edits. I don't have a detailed list of all the music edits from the previous sets, so if anyone has them or has a specific scene containing music they know of that's missing from the old set that they want me to check for in this set, leave a comment. I do remember there being a moment in Episode 2 where The Godfather sings or hums a song in the steam room, which appears to be missing in the re-release as well.

I'll update this review with any relevant information. If you have any questions, just post them in the comments.",1414281600,13,2349,3.8488612836438922
6492371,5,B00LMKKYAS,I watched Soap when it first came out on tv ... have loved it for years and decided to revisit the Campbells and the Tates .... is just as funny and entertaining as when I saw it in the 70's .... this is a series one can view numerous times and still laugh out loud ...,1414108800,2,269,3.8214285714285716

6492374,5,B00LMKKYAS,"This is the best thing to come along since...Well, I suppose you can't compare it to anything. It's just that great! A wonderful cast!  My mom had originally told me about the show and how my grandma had watched it. So when I found it here, I thought it would be a nice thing for my mom and I to watch together. Now my sister is a fan as well, even though she was skeptical at first. There is some off colored humor so if your very sensitive this may not be the show for you. If you can take a joke and don't take everything personally however, you will love this show. Even though this show is from the late 70's/ early 80's the humor still stands up.  I wish there were more than 4 seasons. But at least I can watch Soap for years to come with these great dvds. Now all I need is for ABC's ""Better with You"" to come to dvd. Maybe one day.",1468454400,,840,3.964497041420118

6492379,5,B00LMKKYAS,"Absolutely one of the top 5 sit-coms ever. Your critique should be based on the amount of times it made you laugh out loud. Benson alone gets more laughs than most sit-coms. It all comes back to you, and you have to marathon it. Katherine Helmond is genuinely funny, from the courtroom season during the first year to every situation that falls her way. You might forget Chuck and Bob[puppet/dummy], who play the same role as Benson but deliver spicier lines. I waited for Burt's invisibility, but in the end Mulligans mannerisms in every situation are why he was a favorite. I forgot about Danny & Elaine, and just couldn't get enough of his ""kill her with kindness"" routine. Not sure young people would get it in the sense of the social situations being tackled for the first time in TV during the 70's. No problem with quality, you just get 4 cd's stacked on top of each other.",1437609600,,880,4.540880503144654

6492384,5,B00LMKKYAS,"Zany off-color politically in-correct and totally funny.  This show was late, late night TV and B to C stock when released yet it had and still has a following.  It was counter culture to the Archie Bunker crowd and it broke a lot of glass or closet ceilings.  The later shows were seemingly trying to go for the craziest theme they could dream up.  It was the Rowan and Martin shtick swipe at all the soap operas of the day.  Most people either loved it or hated it, but if taken for what it was, a spoof on all the daytime soaps it was a riot and it still is!",1432598400,,561,4.0636363636363635

6492388,5,B00LMKKYAS,"Soap was a landmark groundbreaking comedy with a stellar ensemble of a cast. It's amazing to relive the series' brilliance. The series is about two middle aged sisters, Jessica Tate (Who's The Boss and Coach's Katherine Helmond) and Mary Campbell (Webster's Cathryn Damon) and their families. Jessica is married to Chester (Three's A Crowd Robert Mandan) and have three children in the wealthy neighborhood. Their adult daughters, Eunice (Jennifer Salt) and Corrine (Diane Canova) have troubled love lives. Eunice is in love with a married politician while Corrine is in love with a priest. They have a teenage son, Billy. The Tates have a wonderful butler named Benson Dubois (played magnificently by Robert Guilliame). Surprisingly, Benson had his own successful spin off series and won an Emmy for Best Leading Actor in a Comedy Series. Robert Guillaume was the first African American actor to win this honor.

The Campbells don't live in such a posh upscale neighborhood. They live in a modest home. Mary's second husband  Bert Campbell (Empty Nest's Richard Mulligan) is keeping secrets from his wife. Mary's sons, Danny and Jodie Dallas also live at home. Danny works for the mob and Jodie (played by legendary comic Billy Crystal) is a homosexual. Dinah Manoff (Empty Nest) plays Danny's wife Elaine. Susan Harris was the genius behind this series. A lot of familiar faces pop up like Doris Roberts, Ted Wass, Inga Swenson and Caroline McWilliams (later appeared as Benson regulars), Sorrell Brooks, Harold Gould, Gordon Jump, Robert Urich, and more.

After watching 47 episodes of this landmark series, I have rediscovered good comedy. Jodie's homosexuality is treated with sensitivity and care even in the late seventies. Some sitcoms today could learn that Jodie's portrayal can be funny, serious, and caring too. Billy Crystal was one of the first pioneers to be a regular character who happened to be a homosexual. The first two seasons had me laughing and crying since a lot does happened to these characters. I wonder why it never lasted longer on television perhaps it was the strike in the early eighties. Still the series is one of the best comedy series to ever air on television.

The set comes with 4 DVDs for 2 seasons. There are no extra features. Despite no extras, the DVD set is high quality and very enjoyable.",1430265600,,2336,5.012886597938144
6492389,5,B00LMKKYAS,"Very funny series with twists and turns.  Wish it was still on T.V.  Also wish I could find the series called ""The Powers that Be"".  If you know where I can find that complete series, too, please let me know.  sbweber1@gmail.com",1430265600,,228,4.487804878048781

6492397,5,B00LMKKYAS,"First, the show is fabulous. You can't go wrong with _Soap_. It's easily in the top ten of best comedy shows ever. The edition itself is the only concern.

I did buy the first season separately, and the two-season set does have some missing footage. Neither version of season one has Jodie singing ""I Feel Pretty"" while wearing Mary's dress, but I've noticed that no one gets home video rights for _West Side Story_ music. (A whole episode of the first season of _Hamish MacBeth_ was left out of the DVD set because they couldn't get the rights.) Hopefully producers will just stop using its songs in broadcast TV.

I suspect other losses. There are times when the ""scenes from last week"" refer to events we didn't see. Of course, it's possible that the missing footage no longer exists. After all, Monty Python (the entire TV series) only exists because a PBS station failed to keep its bargain with the BBC to destroy the shows after the PBS station aired them. The syndicated version may be all that's left of the early _Soap_ episodes.

Therefore it is definitely better than buying seasons 1 and 2 separately (even if only for a classic moment of Benson with Corinne's baby that isn't in the syndicated version and so I suspect not in the season 2 single set). I wish they'd come out with a similar set for seasons 3 and 4 so that I could be certain I was getting all the available footage from those, and I'm hesitant to buy the separate sets in the hope that they will do so.

Hope this helps.",1421971200,8,1500,4.483516483516484
