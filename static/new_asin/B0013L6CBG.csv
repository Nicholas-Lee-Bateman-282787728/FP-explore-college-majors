8251680,5,B0013L6CBG,This DVD is 230 minutes long with no extras. Reviews the 1985 season in which Fast Freddie Spencer regains the title in a close battle with 1984 champ Eddie Lawson. Freddie Spencer became the first man to win the 250cc title along with the 500cc title in the same season. Lots of interviews of competitors and really great job of reviewing the 1985 season. It is well worth owning if you like motorcycle racing. Highly Recommended.,1342915200,,431,4.684210526315789
