8305386,5,B001GI3A0C,"This is one very fantastic DVD. I recommend it to serious teens and adults. While it starts out a bit slow in the very beginning, it's only because he is giving needed background material on himself. Like a taxying 747 it picks up speed and takes off and you can't pull away from it. Not only is the information very important to know and inspiring, his turning from Islam to Christ, but the man is obviously filled with the Spirit of God. The church in the West needs to see what it means to be filled with  the Spirit without making it a doctrinal issue or even speaking much about it. This man demonstrates it by his deep joy and loving yet firm conviction.",1314403200,9,660,4.32258064516129
