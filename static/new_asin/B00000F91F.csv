The first is actually the first two series joined together and in B&W.  The second is one of the later series and is in COLOR.  Note in the B&W version, Lone Ranger has only one standard revolver !  It's crisp, sound transfer is terrific.  Get it !  I also learned what ""Kemo Sabe"" means for the first time !  It's ...... no, find out for yourself by getting this wonderful DVD !

1204517,5,B00000F91F,"The first 3 episodes of the TV series compiled into a feature-length film.

  A band of Texas Rangers is ambushed and slaughtered by an outlaw leader and his gang. But one man survives, nursed back to health by an Indian named Tonto. Vowing to avenge the death of his brother and comrades, the last man disguises his identity with a mask made out of the black vest of his dead brother and sets out to bring all lawbreakers to justice.",1033257600,3,434,4.4
1204518,5,B00000F91F,"This tape is the first three episodes of the Lone Ranger series all put together to make one movie.  I think that the episodes could have been joined together better, because the places where they joined left out a couple things.  For example, at the place where the second and third episodes were joined together, they left out the first time ever that the Lone Ranger shouted, ""Hi Yo Silver, Away!!""  If you want to see the missing details, get the tape entitled ""Enter the Lone Ranger.""  However, ""Legend of the Lone Ranger"" does have one scene that for some reason ""Enter the Lone Ranger"" doesn't have.  I have both of these tapes, and I would recommend getting them both.  At the end of both of them, you get to hear Tonto shout, ""Get 'um up, Scout!""  and the Lone Ranger shout the ever-famous ""Hi Yo Silver, Away!!""  It is a very thrilling conclusion to a great tape.",995328000,26,873,4.481012658227848
1204519,5,B00000F91F,"This (Black & White )video is in fact a combination of the first 3 TV episodes from Sept 1949 (Enter the Lone Ranger, The Lone Ranger fights on and the Lone Ranger's Triumph.
It is really for Lone Ranger fans of the fifties who can remember Moore and Silverheels in the TV role. One has to overlook some serious acting shortcomings because this was in the early days of T.V. Moore is careful to pronounce all his ""ings"" and every sentence seems carefully rehearsed. But then he ""is"" the Lone Ranger and our childhood hero. Tonto is as we remembered him - the loyal companion with an expressionless voice.
(The story line is as we have been told it many times but today's audience would be critical about how so much happened within a few days and the dialogue seems very primitive).
Some little things to notice - the Lone Ranger has only a one gun holster and Silver's saddle was not the silver saddle and martingale that was used later on.
The action is pretty good even if the acting isn't. Good horsemanship by Moore and Silverheels. The introduction isn't the same as the TV series but when you see Moore at the beginning galloping along on Silver and the big letters THE LONE RANGER appear, you feel the lump in your throat.
My son bought this video for me as a Christmas gift and I have watched it 3 times. It runs for just over an hour. A must for all you Lone Ranger fans. Good value.",986774400,60,1393,4.382239382239383

As anyone familiar with the long running classic series knows, these first few episodes concern the ambush of the Texas Ranger posse chasing the ""Butch"" Cavendish gang, the survival of one ranger, his discovery by Tonto, and how he and Tonto then became the ""masked man"" and his faithful sidekick, out to make the West safe (and doing in the Cavendish gang in the process). This compilation was skillfully done and qualifies as a good feature Western. It times in at about 1:06 minutes (I have seen other issues with less or more time). The audio and picture qualities of this Marengo Films release are generally good, certainly not high def quality, but still quite acceptable.

1204637,3,B00000F91F,"Legend of the Lone Ranger, 1949 film

The ""William Tell Overture"" identifies this legendary hero for many Americans. [He was created in the 1930s as a symbol of hope for people suffering from the Great Depression and the gangs that controlled big cities.] Americans settled the Southwest Territory in spite of the dangers. A lone man tells of an attack by the Cavendish gang; he alone survived. A group of six Texas Rangers follow the trail to a canyon. Will they ride into a trap? Do they have a chance? Can Cavendish trust a double agent? A lone rider finds the bodies. Tonto cares for the wounded man, who will use a mask as a disguise. The Lone Ranger will shoot to wound, not to kill. [How realistic is this?] Can that long outlaw be captured alive? Not if there is a slip-up. Can the Lone Ranger save a young stallion from a buffalo? He finds a mount. They ride off to Jim Blaine's ranch and see what happened. They learn about the murders in town.

Jim can be kept hidden in a silver mine. He can mine and refine the silver for cash and bullets. Tonto meets the Sheriff and offers to take him to Jim Blaine, who explains what happened. They follow the trail and find the gang's hide-out. The gang is captured. But more of Cavendish's gang arrive! Tonto goes to town for help, but none volunteer. So he returns alone. One man follows, but is neutralized. The Lone Ranger and Tonto must work alone to rescue the Sheriff and the Doctor. Can they find help? Cavendish tells his gang what happened, they must move fast before the Cavalry arrives. The Sheriff lists the names of the new men in town; they are suspects. Doc Drummond lures these men so they can be arrested. Can a larger group defeat a smaller group? Tonto arrives with more help. Will all of Cavendish's gang be captured? [Its in the script.] Who is that masked man? He is called ""the Lone Ranger"". He and Tonto ride off. ""Hi yo Silver"" as they ride away.

This story explained the origins of the Lone Ranger. He is another force sent to help the people oppressed by gangs. [This is similar to those John Wayne stories from the 1930s.] In this early version the Lone Ranger wears only one pistol; in later shows he will wear two. This story skips on the economics of the conflicts, as was done in other Westerns in the 1950s that used personal conflicts for the drama. The idea of a criminal gang taking over a town has been used in other fiction (""Red Harvest""). Was this the status of many big cities at the time (or even now)? Who rules your city, county, or state?",1377648000,,2535,4.412393162393163

I have loved the Lone Ranger since it first came out.  Especially the use of the Rossini's William Tell Overture for the theme song.  The only thing that disappointed me was that the intro was speeded up.  I also seem to remember that when the TV show was on, the into was abit longer as well.  Otherwise, I enjoyed going back in time to relive my childhood again, if only for a little while.",1234137600,,580,5.857142857142857
1204719,4,B00000F91F,"The quality of this transfer is better than that of others I've seen recently, though Lone Ranger fans would still like to get their hands on an apparently missing color re-creation (filmed several years later and broadcast only twice) of this 1949 black-and-white compilation of the first three episodes of the series, which explain how Texas Ranger Reid (there's some dispute in L. R. lore about his first name) became the Lone Ranger, reunited with his boyhood acquaintance Tonto, and acquired Silver.  With careful use of the pause function on your DVD player, you can see Clayton Moore without his mask before the rangers were ambushed by the Butch Cavendish gang, though the director of the episode took some care to keep Moore in the background and, for the most part, turned away from the camera.",1214438400,3,804,4.911764705882353

My daughter watch the tapes with me when she was in high school. What lured her to watch was it had a horse in it. However after watching this and another collection of episodes(also, some Roy Rogers), she said, ""How come you had all the good stuff to watch when you were a kid."" She was not much impressed with after school or Saturday morning tv.

This is the beginning of the Lone Ranger and his legend. Start here then buy some of the other collections. They are still fun to watch. Just remind special effects are not very much part of old tv stories which had very limited budgets.",1172880000,5,750,4.208333333333333

1204724,5,B00000F91F,"3 episodes of the famous TV show, vintage 1949, edited together into a feature length film, tell the story of the origin of the Lone Ranger. This is the stuff of childhood memories for aging baby-boomers. Clayton Moore's portrayal of the Lone Ranger, and Jay Silverheels as Tonto, is a great memory of Saturday morning TV in the thrilling days of yesteryear. The acting, script, etc. all display B movie quality, at best, but, who cares? The Lone Ranger is a larger than life image that ranks at the top of American pop culture folklore with the greatest of fictional characters. Among staunch Lone Ranger fans, this is a familiar story viewed many times over the years. For the uninitiated, the mask, the silver mine, Silver, and other things are explained. A color episode is also included showing how the TV show changed from 1949 through 1956. The latter episode includes nice color photography, and shows how the heroic image evolved into the red, white, and blue figure on the white horse, complete with gleaming six-guns and silver bullets. As usual, lawbreakers are brought to justice, without excessive or bloody violence, by the end of the half-hour episode. This DVD edition looks great compared to the typical lower-grade VHS editions, all that was previously available. The full screen format is clean and clear, and the audio comes through nicely. As a nostalgic treat, this is wonderful. There is no reason to exclude the kids, if you can get them to put down the electronic games for a couple of hours. 10-year-olds of all ages will enjoy this viewing experience. Ownership is highly recommended. ;-)",1049760000,67,1616,4.901459854014599

It's a small detail,but if,like me,you're enough of a fan of the times to practically be stuck in the '50s,you start nit picking. ALMOST everything is B&W,and ince they didn't start filming in color until the show was sold,some of the episodes have to be colorized. I say it would've been better for the whole thing to be B&W anyway,so it gives the feel of the time.
