I was happy that I did!

Great story, believable acting, terrific special effects and above all it scared me!
I think the helpless feeling this film gave me made it even scarier as the female lead is alone in the country where nobody can help her! It just got in my head thinking about it!

I won't give spoilers, but basically it's about a couple that move from the city into the country and, as it is the husbands childhood home, secrets are uncovered and the wife is the victim of theose secrets coming to light.

Pick this up, it's fun!",1290470400,8,652,4.284552845528455
