3911891,5,B002DMJM5W,My great grandson loves Nick Jr.  When these tapes came he was very happy.  I got some of the toys along with the tapes and he runs to get them when the picture come on.,1342310400,,169,3.8
3911892,2,B002DMJM5W,"I got this for my 3 year old niece to watch at my house, she loves it. The Kai Lan episode with ""Stompy"" is totally annoying! The elephant makes this wounded swan noise that as far as I've seen in nature programs, elephants never make. It's a cute show but Stompy makes that death throes of a swan wailing noise about 87 times and my niece watches it at least twice a week. So thanks Nickelodeon for making kids dvd's even more irritating for adults to listen to.",1340928000,2,463,4.2727272727272725
3911893,3,B002DMJM5W,"My daughter loves this DVD, and I do love the longer running time, but every time she wants to watch it we have to either sit through 6 long commercials or manually fast forward though them because it won't let you hit menu straight to the shows. The commercials are essentially selling more of the same, there is one for each video featured; I already bought this so it's unnecessary and irritating in my opinion. Had I known about that I probably would have just bought a couple individual videos from iTunes.",1338163200,2,511,4.565217391304348
3911894,4,B002DMJM5W,"My daughter loves Yo Gabba Gabba and Kai Lan so I was glad to find a DVD with similar shows that she might enjoy.  She really doesn't like when Dora and Diego are on, but loves the other shows and we have started to watch them more and branch out.  The DVD is fun and lots of really cute clips and songs.  My daughter is so into animals right now so this is a perfect subject for her.  The DVD is a lot longer than I expected which is a good thing!  I would love to see similar products and would buy them again.  Sometimes the same old shows get old, so it's nice to mix it up a bit.",1319155200,,584,3.825
3911895,5,B002DMJM5W,"My 2yr old loves this DVD. She's not a huge fan of any one of the shows separately, but on this DVD she would watch all of them everyday if she could. She also quickly learns from it; Dora does the ""Animal ABCs"" and after only 2 viewings she started reciting the ABCs. Good value!",1311552000,,280,4.109090909090909
3911896,5,B002DMJM5W,I bought this DVD for my two year old son he loves it. It's a great compilation of his favorite Nick Jr shows.,1298073600,3,110,3.8260869565217392
3911897,4,B002DMJM5W,"I love that Nick Jr. puts out these dvds that has a variety of their popular kids shows on them, rather than buy one dvd all of the same show.  My 2 & 1/2 year old has broadened her horizons by watching some of these 'new to her' shows, and now she likes many more things besides Barney and Blues Clues.

This particular dvd gets a lot of play time at our house, it's often what she asks for when she gets tv time and I think it was very reasonably priced for what you get - money well spent.",1282262400,10,492,3.91
