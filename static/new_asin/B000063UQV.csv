1693308,5,B000063UQV,"After watching and enjoying the first Zatoichi DVD, I decided to buy the second installment. I'm glad I did because its even better than the first.
 After being hired to massage a distinguished lord, Zatoichi discovers a secret that could ruin the lord's clan. This sets the story in motion as the lord's retainers send thier samurai and local gangsters after the blind masseur. In this movie we learn a little bit of Ichi's past. In fact a mysterious rival from his past turns up. We are also treated to more of Shintaro Katsu's excellent swordmanship which is even better in this movie than the first.",1026691200,3,603,4.688679245283019
1693309,4,B000063UQV,"Criterion in association with Janus Films has exquisitely remastered the first two of 26 sequels in the life and adventures of Japan's most popular and enduring cinematic hero, Zatoichi, the blind swordsman.  A common man with an extraordinary skill and an even greater moral imperative.

""THE TALE OF ZATOICHI CONTINUES"" is Volume Two of The Blind Swordsman series.  Features revved up action, a lethal love triangle and a freaky one-armed samurai.  When Zatoichi realizes that the lord who has hired him is going insane -- a madness, that if made public would topple his empire and the livelihood of his samurai warriors -- he flees a wanted man pursued by the mad lord's samurais and hired yakuza mercenaries.  Zatoichi manages to escape until he is forced to confront his old foe -- the one armed warrior (played by Kenzaburo, Shintaro Katsu's brother who changed his name to Tomisaburo Wakayama and starred as Itto Ogami in the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series).
This is a great series that has been hotly desired by an eclectic group of samurai videophiles who call themselves ""Ichi Freaks.""  With the release of the newly restored, widescreen DVDs and the smoother translated subtitles, their number will certainly grow.",1022716800,10,1221,5.01980198019802
1693310,5,B000063UQV,"This is the second in a series of 20-plus films about traveling masseur, petty gangster, and deadly swordsman Zatoichi. This film looks a tad better than the first one. HVE is to be commended for putting these films out in a widescreen format as well as trying to restore them to their original luster. After all, this is a nearly 40 year old movie! This film builds on some of the characters and situations from the first one so it's advisable to get that one first. One thing about this series is that it relies on as much dialogue as it does action. Zatoichi is a likable rogue, but he's not turned into a total scoundrel. If you're serious about collecting Japanese cinema, as well as good martial arts films, then the Zatoichi films are a must buy. Trivia Note: the one armed samurai in this film is played by Shintaru Katsu's real life brother-Kenzaburo Jo, who later took the name Tomisaburo Wakayama and went on to play the character Itto Ogami in the ""Lone Wolf and Cub/Shogun Assassin"" series.",1022544000,66,1003,4.5777777777777775
1693311,5,B000063UQV,"Wow... I have all the Zatoichi movies on VHS and I have never seen quality transfer like this. Its extremely hard to transfer older movies like this to DVD because of the picture quality on the originals.... They did an awesome awesome job! The movie on top of that is just plain amazing as well.
If your looking at the review and wondering what Zatoichi is?
Well these are genre films. Very well put together with quality acting and wonderful cinematography for its time. The way that Shintaro Katsu can create a character is beyond the capabilities of 99% of the actors today. Well thats just my opinion.",1022284800,4,606,4.62037037037037
1693391,4,B000063UQV,"A production made within two decades of the end of WWII Zatoichi gives a glimpse into the heart and mindset of Japanese culture before the advent of western influence. The different castes in Japanese society and the manner in which they related to one another on a day by day basis. Entertaining certainly, educational absolutely.",1438473600,,331,5.036363636363636

1693393,5,B000063UQV,Volume 2 could be considered the second half of the pilot for the Zatoichi series.  It nicely completes the opening story.,1420848000,,122,4.809523809523809
1693394,4,B000063UQV,"The second installment of the long-running Japanese samurai series does not disappoint.  When Zatoichi (Shintaro Katsu) discovers that a powerful lord is insane, the lord's retainers decide to kill him for fear of the consequences should he reveal the fact.  As Ichi says later, all they had to do was ask him to keep it quiet and he would have.  However, dishonorable men expect only dishonorable behavior from everyone, so they see murder as the only solution.  At the same time, a foe from Zatoichi's past appears to complicate matters.

This movie has more going for it than just great action, although it certainly has plenty of that.  Zatoichi is a genuinely likeable character and the climactic battle has some real emotional heft to it.",1339113600,,744,4.912
1693395,5,B000063UQV,"This second film in the Zato Ichi series shows a bit more about Zato Ichi and his background. In this film, which takes place a year after the first one, Ichi is returning to the town where he had killed his friend, Hirate Miki (as shown in the first film). He wishes to pay respect to Hirate.

As it turns out, in this film, it seems that everyone and his brother (literally, as we'll see) ends up after Ichi. At first, we see Ichi in his profession as a blind masseur. He is giving a massage to the local daimyo. The daimyo reveals during the massage that he is quite insane. The retainers decide that they must kill Ichi in order to prevent the world from knowing that their lord is insane -- if this knowledge were to get out, the Shogunate might abolish the clan. Then there are the local yakuza who also want to go after Ichi. And then a mysterious one-armed warrior, who it turns out, is Ichi's brother in disguise as a ronin (both Ichi and his brother were born as commoners). Ichi resents his brother because earlier, Ichi's fiancee left him for his brother when Ichi was revealed as becoming blind. In feudal Japan (as well as in feudal Europe and other places) being blind automatically consigned the person into a ""non-human"" state, usually condemning a blind person into the caste of begging and similar occupations.

There are some conflicting stories about how and when Ichi became blind. In this film version, Ichi became blind as a young adult. In the TV series, Ichi became blind as a child.

The subplots are too complex to sum up here. Suffice it that there is a final conflict between Ichi and his brother. Needless to say, Ichi is still alive though his brother is not. Not quite as compelling as the first film, but still great.",1325203200,,1751,4.482758620689655
1693396,4,B000063UQV,"Not as good as the 1st but still decent. Story wasn't setup as well, and the ""plot twist"" was seen coming from a mile away. Short movie as well. Was kinda dissapointed what with my 3+ hour marathon movies of late.  Shintaro Katsu is extremely likeable as the title character and better than Takeshi Kitano in this role.",1173744000,2,319,4.5
1693397,4,B000063UQV,"This is the last black-and-white episode of the Zatoichi films. And like the first episode, we find the protagonist Zatoichi [Shintaro Katsu] returning to the scene of the first episode. Ichi has come to pay his respects to the Ronin, Hirate, whom Ichi did not wish to kill. Ichi's brother, Yoshiro, [Tomisaburo Wakayama] in both the film, and in true life, is in the episode. And as usual he is larger than life. The film starts off with the usual Ichi trademark of humor, which will become more pronounced as the episodes continue.

Yoshiro, the one-armed samurai is his brother: and his brother has a grudge with Ichi. At the same time, Yoshiro and his sidekick must elude the law, which have a bounty on his head.

Throughout the film Zatoichi gives off the nuances of humor which he will make a trademark of in regards to the character. As the episode begins, Ichi is asked to give a massage to the Lord to Edo, however, he discovers that the lord is a lunatic. The court retainers wish to keep this a secret, therefore, they attempt to kill Ichi because he has heard the antics of the Lord while giving him a massage. They don't yet realize who they are up against.

Zatoichi's reputation has not been cemented yet in this early installment, moreover, the action scenes in the second episode are limited in the beginning. Not so with the ending however, and as the film nears the end Zatoichi has begun to cement his reputation as a swordsman to be reckoned with. The cinematography is very good, and they will only get better as the Zatoichi saga continues. I do not wish to spoil the ending for you, but if you hang in there with the plot, you will see the beginnig stages of this magnificent swordsman. Highly recommended.",1157328000,2,1731,4.577419354838709
1693398,5,B000063UQV,"In the early seventies, I was enamored of the Zatoichi and Sword of Vengence movies produced in Japan, and viewed at the Toho Brea Theatres in Los Angeles. When the Toho closed down, these movies were lost to me and others. Now, they are back, on DVD, with Japanese wording and good subtitles! Thank you for making these great works of Movie History available again! Everything about them is excellent!! 10 stars would be better!!",1140825600,26,430,4.746666666666667
1693399,5,B000063UQV,"I've seen basically all of the 'Zatoichi' films and this is far and away the best. Although it's relatively short (75 minutes or so), it's got well-coreographed fight scenes, great acting (when he's not killing three people at a time, you'd think Shintaro Katsu was really blind), and all sorts of wonderful plot twists. In this film, Zatoichi develops more as a character rather than as a gimmick. Although the first film was superb, we really only got to see that he was this avenging angel from the yakuza, if such a thing is not a contradiction in terms. This time around, however, we get to see more of what motivates Ichi as well as some more insight into his past. We are introduced in this chapter to Ichi's law-breaking brother, played by Tomisaburo Wakayama (who was Shintaro Katsu's brother in real life as well). We learn that the two had previously feuded over the same woman to the point that Ichi cut off his brother's arm in a fit of rage. While all this is going on, Ichi is being pursued by Kanbei, an assassin sent to dispatch Ichi before he can tell of Kanbei's lord's insanity. In his pursuit of Ichi, Kanbei hooks up with Sukegoro, Ichi's employer from the previous installment who has a score to settle with the blind swordsman. These various groups all come into conflict with one another at various points and make for a film that is simultaneously action-packed and well thought out. Highest recommendations.",1098230400,26,1434,4.694444444444445
1693400,4,B000063UQV,"Yet another good offerring in the Zatoichi series of films.  About the only thing I can offer that I have not seen mentioned before in any of the reviews is that this one is a fair bit shorter than part one but it has quite a bit more action than the first.  At any rate, and most importantly, if you liked the first, you will like the second as well as the rest of the recent releases on dvd( of which they are apparantly going to release the first seventeen films in the Zatoichi series.). Also, a company called animeigo has the rights to a few of the later Zatoichi films and are supposedly planning on releasing them in the near future as well.",1037404800,22,649,4.225806451612903

Film = two stars; restoration/preservation = four (4) stars; cinematography = three (3) stars; score = two (2) stars; choreography = two (2) stars.  Director Kazuo Mori picks up the reins of an emerging franchise in a rushed follow-on film that is a pale imitation of the first outing (the original seems to have been released only a few months previously).  The blind self-taught sword swinger who is a traveling masseur by trade (and provides rub downs only on fully-dressed customers!) continues to hang out in the same small village and effortlessly cuts down inept yakusa gang members (while not slicing himself!), but conspicuously avoids samurai soldiers who, of course, really know how to use their swords.  For muddled/contrived reasons, the protagonist is chased all over the place by two warring gangs of yakusa, a band of samurai, the police, and a besotted prostitute.  (It's a bit of a challenge for the three interested viewers out there to distinguish between the tribes except that the samurai are a bit better dressed and have cooler hair styles!)  There are a fair number of disconnected scenes which look suspiciously like out-takes from the first film.  Continuity is often lacking with a character's full costume changing from cut to cut.  Cinematography (2.35 : 1, black and white) is good.  The wide-screen format is fully utilized, there are a few interesting exterior tracking shots, a novel scene photographed so as to appear right at ground level, and nausea-inducing panning is minimal.  Restoration/preservation  is great.  Subtitles are close enough.  Signs are translated.  Characters who survived in the original movie all seem to make a reappearance.  Acting is fine (except for one silly addition), and actresses are given much more to do this time besides being part of the scenery.  Choreography is again pretty inept with sword slashing mostly a joke made more humorous when stunt actors pause (for ""dramatic"" effect?) before falling over.  This comes across as if performers are trying to make up their mind whether or not to collapse!  There is an occasional glint of metal; so in this iteration some of the swords may be real?  Score mostly employs a synthesizer and is undistinguished.  A Daiei programmer not worth bothering with.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1506124800,,2462,5.138539042821159
