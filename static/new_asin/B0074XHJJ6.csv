Once you begin this journey with those who sing the sun up each day and in their different perches and meandering flights, shatter the audacity of our unknowing which when really heard will open the doors of the love to which we were born. Each day, learning the call of those who surround us enriches the world we have mostly slept through in our amnesia of the original agreements our Ancestors had with the Holy all around us. These feathered merchants without the need to be paid other than with our praise can sustain us and awaken us into this abundant world of their gifting. Sing on and find your own song as you listen.",1336435200,7,965,6.0510948905109485
8510245,3,B0074XHJJ6,I was hoping for more than was in Jon Young's books.  But it didn't provide anything else.  Lots of good bird video and the topic is really great if you don't have the books.  Jon Young really opens up a whole new world for his readers.,1485475200,,236,4.086956521739131
8510246,5,B0074XHJJ6,"The DVD that I received has a 15 second studder or bad spot in the first few minutes of the DVD, but I still give it 5 stars because the content is a well presented talk of stuff that helps me  be more in touch with the life around me. This should be of interest to anyone that enjoys nature. I will likely purchase a few more to give as gifts.",1460764800,,344,3.8450704225352115
8510247,4,B0074XHJJ6,"This video is great at what the title says it is about; BASIC bird language.  For those who do not spend much time in nature, it gives information on how to tell if a bird is in a calm state or in maintenance or if it alarmed.  The narrator does confuse me when he says people in America don't believe that this can be done until he shows them it can be.  I know of very few people who cannot hear or see alarm in birds and track it back to its source.  But I am sure there are people who can't and this is a good introduction to this very basic of skills in learning bird language.  The narrator does seem to have some biased against the corvids, some of the best teachers of bird language there is, first stating that baby corvids are annoying to listen to and later telling us to learn from other birds instead of the corvids.  Corvid language though may be a bit more complicated for a basic DVD.

I gave it 4 stars because it does what the title says it does, teaches the most basic of bird languages.  It didn't do me much good because I already knew when a bird (or frog or howling coyote or barnyard sheep) goes abruptly quiet, it is for a reason.  Or that a bird's alarm call means it's alarmed. I was hoping for a bit more; like the bubble talk of the cowbird means there are herd animals about, or that the chatter of the eagle can lead the tracker to the kill site, or that different water fowls calls can lead a person to the best fishing hole or even to water if one is thirsty, or the raven's pattern speaks to who or what is moving through the northern forest.

Again, great for the basics of bird language, which is what it says its going to do.  I guess I was just hoping for a bit more.",1440892800,4,1705,4.074850299401198

8510252,5,B0074XHJJ6,"""Bird Language"" by Jon Young, is the companion dvd to his excellent book ""What the Robin Knows.""  Here is a straight forward, honest, simply stated introduction to the language of the wild.  Jon uses the birds to illustrate just how common and interrelated are the noises the animals and birds outside are. Jon uses the birds to demonstrate the communication both intraspecies and interspecies that occurs both in the wilds and in our yards.

We see and hear Jon himself narrating a hour long discussion of bird language.  This is presented in a easy to understand and easy to apply way.  We see many videos of, and hear several demonstrations of birds' songs, companion calls, juvenile begging, territorial aggression, and their many alarms, both sound and movement.  We hear both described and demonstrated how the birds react to different threats. We hear discussions of and videos of various bushman natives using the bird language to stay alive in their world.

I would strongly recommend both this dvd, and its companion book, to anyone wanting to work or recreate in the out doors.  By listening and being aware, you yourself can avail yourself of the alarms and warnings being presented around you.  You may be the cause of the alarms. Hopefully you can learn how to decrease the alarms you incite. Or, you may be the prey of a predator. The birds will warn you. You can locate game, and avoid spooking game by being aware of the bird language in an area. You can greatly increase the number of wildlife you will encounter by listening to the bird language.

There is a bonus material dvd which gives a detailed discussion and demonstration of a group of young adults learning bird language, along with listing several good other sources. But with the knowledge Jon imparts himself on this dvd, any individual can begin to decipher what the birds are saying.

So, grab and listen to this dvd, and head outdoors to practice a very rewarding tool or hobby.",1363478400,10,1962,4.792284866468843
8510253,5,B0074XHJJ6,"Bird Language: Extreme Awareness for the Tactical Edge!

This DVD set ""Bird Language with Jon Young - How to Interpret the Behaviors and Patterns of Nature"" is an indispensable tool to learning and understanding the art and science of bird language. This DVD is a standalone tool to learning this ""foreign"" language, but I highly recommend it be used in conjunction with Jon Young's book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-the-Robin-Knows-How-Birds-Reveal-the-Secrets-of-the-Natural-World/dp/0547451253/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What the Robin Knows: How Birds Reveal the Secrets of the Natural World</a>"" (see my Amazon review) to give you all the information that is available to date for the general public outside of attending a seminar.

My perspective and review is a 180-degrees from most reviews you will read about this product. I love nature, wildlife and I am an avid tracker. However, my review will focus on the tactical edge this skill-set can provide the individual operating in harm's way. Understanding the cues, alarms, calls and sign of wildlife and in particular birds is not new. It has been used by man for centuries for hunting and warfare to ""alarm"" man to the presence and/or danger of a predator. These hunters and warriors may have not known that they were interpreting this language, but learned and understood it instinctively. What this DVD set does is bring this foreign language to anybody willing to learn it by distilling years (and years) of lessons learned into a two-hour block of instruction to give the viewer an accelerated learning curve. I have used this art and science of bird language while hunting and operationally in combat, in an assortment of far-off foreign lands of Africa and other exotic locations with extraordinary results. This bird langue is universal and can be effectively used in any environment and I have done it. I could even boost that it has saved my life. But understand I am by no means an expert in bird language, but I have learned enough of the fundamentals to enhance my tactical awareness.

This DVD covers all fundamentals to enhance your awareness that have given me the tactical edge. The DVD guides you through the understanding of how the ""bird"" know and understand there environment baseline and cue off of disturbances to this baseline alerting the individuals who understand this language. These cues come from the interpretation of varies vocalization (song, call, alarm, begging, aggression, etc.), behavior and/or kinesics (hook, plow, bullet, popcorn, etc.). Understanding this language and employing it tactically allows you to move and operate with stealth, without disturbing the baseline. Whereas the uninitiated to this understanding create disturbances to the baseline, in turn making concentric rings of alarms from various wildlife giving their presence away. Overall the DVD covers a host of material with a complete training outline; I wish I had the DVD set years ago. If I had I would have eliminated a host of trial and errors. I recommend this DVD not only to naturalist, but hunters, survivalist, and military personnel looking for that tactical advantage.

I also recommend looking into the following if you find this DVD set interesting;

8510254,5,B0074XHJJ6,This DVD set is an awesome resource to both introduce bird language and to delve deeply into interpretation of bird language over a landscape. After watching the first DVD you will observe birds differently. You will begin to recognize sounds and movement of birds in your yard and to interpret their meanings. The first DVD covers 5 backyard birds that are helpful in interpreting bird language and helps you pick birds to get to know in your own region. It also covers the 5 voices of the birds and the shapes of alarm through narration; actual footage; and animations. The second DVD provides mapping conventions for doing a bird sit with a group. It explains how to select a site; how to work as a team observing and mapping bird language over a landscape; and provides stories and anecdotes from real people using bird language. The special features also provide in-depth interpretations of a bird sit and other useful resources. The laminated reference card is great for carrying into the field. Learning bird language is a way to deeply connect to nature and yourself. I highly recommend this as a resource.,1337904000,15,1114,4.837696335078534
