8597094,3,B00DSAUKH2,"The first three disks are great but the last disk has problems. The last 4 stories on the disk won't play. There seems to be a problem with the disk or when it was copied to the disk. Anyway, I gave it a three star because of this. The shows were great and I even remembered one or two from when I was young. WOULD BUY AGAIN even with bad disk.",1525651200,,344,3.859154929577465

8597096,2,B00DSAUKH2,"I was disappointed to find that this set had no one episode that wasn't included in the larger set.  For the money, the large set is a MUCH better deal.  I LOVE One Step Beyond and was hoping this would lead me to the entire series.  I was wrong.",1457481600,3,246,3.979591836734694

8597099,5,B00DSAUKH2,"Best of One Step Beyond was one of the best set of thrillers I've ever invested in. The majority of the set had so many really frightening, yet phenomenal stories.
I thoroughly enjoyed them. Every time I watch them, there is so many things that I discover new things.
For its time, it is entertaining and a real thriller.
These came before the Twilight Zone, and they are all based on true events!
This was very very good!",1404518400,7,422,4.423076923076923
