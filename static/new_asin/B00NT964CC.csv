6679721,5,B00NT964CC,Great gift for my little boy who loves Octonauts!,1426464000,,49,4.555555555555555
6679722,5,B00NT964CC,"I think we have probably watched this movie every other day since we received it. If that doesn't tell you something about a 4 year old liking it- I don't know what will. My daughter was never the biggest Octonauts fan- I'll be honest, but these adventures REALLY captured her interest and she loves to watch them over and over. There is something about a pirate adventure that makes her very happy, and she giggles a LOT when she sees the ""walking fish"" episode. ""They're funny mama"".
I love that the Octonauts make learning a joyful, exciting experience. We will be watching (ALL the time). YAY!",1423008000,,597,4.6415094339622645
6679723,5,B00NT964CC,"As always, my son loved this dvd! The Octonauts have become a staple in our household. I would definitely recommend this adventure packed dvd!",1422057600,,142,4.958333333333333
6679724,5,B00NT964CC,"The Octonauts to the rescue again!! My daughter absolutely adores the Octonauts and this movie just keeps her love for them going! We have watched this movie, even just for background noise, once a day for two weeks now! It is fun to have all new episodes to watch and to meet some new characters on this dvd. I have to admit, I find myself watching them right a long with my daughter! These are by far her favorite and I love how learning based they are. I appreciate that she can have fun with the silly characters while learning about real animals and situations. Great job Ncircle!",1421884800,,585,4.425925925925926
6679725,5,B00NT964CC,"My girls love the Octonauts. This DVD contains seven episodes from the Disney Jr. cartoon. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

1. Amazon Adventure - Kwazii searches a shipwreck for Calico Jack's map to an city of gold.
2. Flying Swords - Kwazii searches for the Sword of the Pirate King that is protected by swordfish.
3. Leafy Sea Dragons - The team must find some sea dragons that get into the Octopod.
4. Pirate Parrotfish - Parrotfish help out after Kwazii finds Calico Jack's Parrot Island treasure map.
5. Speedy Sailfish - Some speedy fish help out when the Gups speed away by mistake.
6. Combtooth Blenny - Peso is marooned on a desert island with walking fish.
7. Eel Ordeal - The Octonauts help an injured Eel.",1421625600,63,807,4.527397260273973
6679726,5,B00NT964CC,"The Octonauts have done it again! The newest release Pirate Adventures follows in the footsteps of its predecessors and provides a valuable learning opportunity for people of all ages. Obviously, Octonauts is geared toward younger children, but I would wager that most adults who have the experience of catching an episode would admit that they learn something new in the process every time. Whether it is learning an interesting fact about a creature you've already heard of or being introduced to an aquatic species that sounds too whimsical to be true, there is much knowledge to be gained by viewing the Octonauts. The episodes included on this disc are Amazon Adventure, Flying Swords, Leafy Sea Dragons, Pirate Parrotfish, Speedy Sailfish, Combtooth Blenny and Eel Ordeal. As usual, there is a bonus feature including 6 creature reports. My kids especially enjoyed the double-length episode where Kwazii reunites with his long-lost grandfather on the Amazon. I can't say enough good things about this series- my kids get so excited when a new DVD is released! With a runtime of 90 minutes, packed full of clever antics and lots of factual tidbits, you can't go wrong purchasing this treat for your kids (and maybe yourself)!

*Disclaimer: I received this DVD as part of the NCircle NSider program. This review reflects my honest opinion.",1421539200,,1343,5.1045454545454545
6679727,5,B00NT964CC,"We have this DVD, and our 3 year old daughter loves it (as she loves all things Octonaut).  The episode selection on this DVD is a little strange, though.  Usually they will post all the episodes on one screen, but this one will have three, and next to the ""main menu"" option at the bottom (when you are in episode selection), there is an arrow on the right.  Clicking on this will take you to the other 4  options.  As always, the adventures are great, just right for preschoolers, and I like that there's an informative Creature Report following the episodes.  This DVD also contains the double feature, ""Amazon Adventure"".  Will update after we watch that one.",1420502400,2,663,4.615384615384615
