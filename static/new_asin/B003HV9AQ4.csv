8397228,5,B003HV9AQ4,"This offering has the same menu layout as Family MUVE, with playlists, instructions, animated icons, levels of intensity and music-only soundtrack.
These are easygoing routines, led by the 'muse' and sometimes using chairs.
There is the usual freedom of expression and pleasant, Island-inspired music that is the trademark of MUVE.
MUVE is great for all ages, beginners and beyond.
For fun and fitness, I recommend that you MUVE it!",1368489600,,432,5.27536231884058
