1367691,1,B00004XPPF,"My 3 and 4 year olds are devoted to Thomas, and we counted down the days till this video came out.  Peter Fonda gives an abysmal performance, Mara Wilson is insolent, and the entire film is unbearably confusing.  We saw this film three times in the Theatre until I revolted and refused to sit through it again unless I could bring along a book and a booklight.  It is unabashadly horrible and I would avoid it at all costs. Do not allow it into your homes.",973987200,4,456,4.27906976744186
1367692,5,B00004XPPF,"My son was a die hard Thomas fan before seeing the movie.  He loved the movie, and Thomas always has interesting stories and wonderful lessons for the kids.  He will watch it over and over at home.  The only negative I can think of are the names that Diesel-10 calls the other tank engines - nothing too bad - but does call them names.  Also, Diesel-10 is a bad character who wants to get rid of all the steam engines, so there is an element of ""bad"".  I thought it was just fine for my 3 year old.",973728000,3,498,4.040816326530612
1367693,3,B00004XPPF,"When this movie came to the theaters I heard horrible things about it, mostly that it was too scary for children.  I decided to purchase it anyway because my 2 year old LOVES Thomas and we watched it together. I was pleased that it wasn't scary for my son to watch but I was disappointed with the story line.  I felt as if the script for this movie was written as they filmed this movie.  However, I think only adults will notice all the things that don't make sense and the acting is pretty bad, except for Alec Baldwin and the voices for the trains. Little kids will love the Island of Sodor scenes with the trains. I was also disappointed with the message this movie gives.  Yes, it is important to be really useful and helpful, but how about Peter Fonda being a little more worried that his Granddaughter has disappeared and then Alec Baldwin suggesting that maybe her Grandfather could guess where she was??? This gives a disappointing message.  Overall, this movie is entertaining and not a  total waste, I just hope if they make another movie they think about the plot and message a little more.",973296000,13,1102,4.5125628140703515
1367694,4,B00004XPPF,"We all know that two year olds are not the most attentive, but mine sat through this up beat adventure three times in a theatre. I was shocked! The movies is a little hard to follow, with several things happening at once, but the kids seem to love seeing their favorite character in a longer story.  All of the well loved character from the television show are present in this feature film. very young Children love it, but adult and older children may have a hard tiem sitting thrrough what feel like an adventure that never ends.",973209600,,531,4.474226804123711
1367695,5,B00004XPPF,I went to take my kids to see this at the theater for the very first time at the theater ever.  At the time my kids were 2 1/2 and 15 months they sat through the entire movie which is really unusual for them at home.  It was so exciting for them to see.  Its a great movie to watch with your kids.,973123200,2,297,3.6825396825396823
1367696,1,B00004XPPF,"Sure, my three year old son loved this as much as he loves all the Thomas stories, but my wife and I were horrified by how much the moviemakers decided to forget about any adult viewers.  Fonda looks like he just viewed every film he made after Easy Rider and then was called to the set, and Wilson is much too old for this kind of little girl part anymore.  I hope Britt Allcroft can improve on this, she owes Thomas fans, young and old, much more.",971049600,8,449,4.149425287356322
1367697,1,B00004XPPF,"My 3-year-old daughter adores Thomas, as do her mother and I.  We looked forward to this movie for months, but were all tremendously disappointed.  Instead of seeing an entertaining Thomas adventure, we saw a film with a  confused plot involving a parallel world in which a very depressing Peter  Fonda was featured.  Even in the Island of Sodor scenes, the Thomas action  took a back seat to miniature conductors and magic gold dust.
This may  have been entertaining to some, but was grossly out of touch with the  elegance of the original stories.  The Thomas mania is due to the charm of  Thomas and his friends, not the bizarre magical Shining Time Station.  The  makers of this film forgot what made millions of children adore the Thomas  stories.",968716800,9,752,4.78125
1367698,5,B00004XPPF,"I saw this movie three times with my son and I am definitely buying the video.  My favorite character is Junior(Michael E. Rodgers).  He is so  adorable.  Peter Fonda(Burnette Stone) did a fine job. Alec Baldwin is just  great.  My son also has all of the thomas story videos and his favorites  are the ones narrated by Alec Baldwin.  I recomend this movie to any body,  Even if you don't have kids. I wish Sodor were real.",967334400,9,423,4.3896103896103895
1367699,5,B00004XPPF,"I really love this movie and so does my little nephew. I really love Thomas. If your little kids love Thomas, take them to see this wonderful  movie, I guarantee that your kids would want to see this movie again.",966124800,,212,4.3

1367732,3,B00004XPPF,"This movie was ok. It was not really that interesting. For some reason this movie has Mr Conductor and Shining Time Station in it. Why not let the movie take place in only one world, just have a world where trains talk and that's it. The New characters (the engine characters) are good. Lady is a beautiful character voiced by Britt Allcroft. Diesel 10 is very funny and very evil character. Splatter and Dodge make good comic relief. The human characters are not that interesting, with the exception of Mr Conductor and C. Junior, they are pretty good. The voice actors for the engines are ok, except for Percy and James. Why do they have woman voice actors when they are male characters. The plot was kind of boring but it had some good scenes. (My Personal favorite was the chase scene between Lady, Thomas and Diesel 10.) The songs (I know how the moon must feel, and Really Useful Engine) are good. Overall it is a average movie.",1505606400,,934,4.5325443786982245
1367733,5,B00004XPPF,"I am a adult and loved this film and willl continue to do so  even if realizing a lof the mistakes they made by the film production. I remember seeing this on VHS, which I still think we still have! and try to keep it short, it is still pretty nolsalgic to myself for various interests reasons as this film had a major impact Hobby wise Even if I am an adult and this franchise is what got me interested into Real Railways across the pond. So yes this is applicable under the nolsalgia category. Even if their isn't any mention about specific parts as I enjoy the entirety of the film.",1505520000,,585,4.223214285714286

1367738,3,B00004XPPF,"Like it says in the headline, I have mixed reviews about this movie. Things that I like about this movie is how Eddie Glen voiced Thomas. I think his voice fits Thomas very well. I also love the song ""He's A Really Useful Engine"". I think this version of the song is better than the original. Now the things that I don't like about this movie is the plot. The plot is confusing and doesn't make much sense. I also don't like how Susan Roman voiced James and how Linda Ballantyne voiced Percy. Their voices don't fit James and Percy at all. They're male characters with female voices. That is so messed up. Also, Peter Fonda is so bland in his performance. He is almost like a robot. So emotionless and boring. He could have done a much better job. Even a baby could have more emotion than him. So these are my positive and negative reviews about this film.",1501200000,,856,4.35625
1367739,5,B00004XPPF,"Our grandson loves Thomas and he had the DVD before, but it destroyed itself one day, so ordered one from Amazon and he has been happy since.  This movie has characters that are actors, but it blends with the Thomas theme.",1500854400,,222,4.414634146341464
1367740,1,B00004XPPF,"This is a strange and uneven movie.  It says it's written and directed by Britt Allcroft, the same guy who wrote the regular Thomas movies.  However, I find that hard to believe.  It seems like a movie that changed writers about 9 times.  The inclusion of ""magic"", the inexplicable jumping back and forth between Shining Time and Sodor, Alec Baldwin's character being miniature in size, his Australian cousin  - it's like a fruit salad of mismatched elements  that someone pulled out of a bag at random.  And don't get me started on Peter Fonda.  I'm guessing Alec Baldwin wasn't excited to be in the movie either, but at least he commits to his part and does an enthusiastic job.  Peter Fonda might as well be made of cardboard for all he adds to the role.  The thing I dislike the most, however, about this movie is that the characters of Percy and Thomas are given so little screen time.  It really should be called something else.  That all being said, my 7-yr-old likes this movie very much.",1500681600,,996,4.564971751412429

It was offered for a limited time on one of our video streaming subscriptions, but was then taken down.  My boys loved it so much, I decided to purchase the DVD for Christmas. I personally find the story a bit corny, with mediocre acting, but my kids don't care.  They would watch any Thomas-related video as often as possible.

1367999,1,B00004XPPF,"If I could give this ZERO STARS, I would.  We've had this movie for 10 years and, while our young kids have loved it, it gets more and more painful to watch, or even listen to from the kitchen.  Oh my gosh, the storyline is ridiculous and the writing is horrible.  Really and truly, I'm confident my third grader writes more coherently than Britt Allcroft did in this movie.  It's also incredibly disturbing.  One of the main characters, Burnett Stone, is a grandpa that is almost grossly obsessed with Lady the train.  What 65-year-old man has a nearly romantic fixation with a train?  This guy.  He's more concerned about Lady than his own granddaughter.  He has a secret workshop in a cave and plays trains while caressing a picture of this ""mysterious and magical Lady of the mountain.""  Just EEW.

The little, little kids will like it, yes, because it's got heroes and villains, but Mom & Dad will only be able to handle watching it once or twice and only to mock it.",1422057600,,972,4.528735632183908

1368026,4,B00004XPPF,"Kid score on this movie is 5+ stars. My kids can't watch this enough.  The Parent score for this film is somewhere in the 2.5 range because it's a little bizarre and disjointed, strange scenes, awkward performances and annoying voices.

This is a feature-length Thomas film that doesn't conform to any of the normal conventions of any versions of the TV show the way other feature Thomas Films do (Like the Great Discovery).  The animated part of the film focuses around Thomas, Lady and Diesel 10 and only shows other trains slightly. The live-action portion of the film features Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda in strange roles. The narrative of this story is all over the place and can't hone in on a style of art direction. The tone is first whimsical, then nostalgic, then melancholy then rowdy. All over the place.",1419984000,2,817,4.73943661971831
1368027,2,B00004XPPF,"This movie doesn't hold well. While I was happy it showcased shiny time station, I have to say the more recent Thomas movies are crafted much better then this movie.

The dialog is painful. And so is some of the acting.

My child is a train and Thomas fanatic, but he was only interested in moments. And he loves the more modern animated Thomas movies, as well as the older ones that are collections of the original stories with the model trains.

But I would still recommend this title to little Thomas fans. Yes it's hokey and corny and cheesy, but it's all with a warm heart. Think of this movie as one who is in the same boat as movies like Theodore Rex,  the land before time, and earnest saves Christmas.

But I only recommend it if your looking for something different out of the Thomas franchise.",1419811200,2,804,4.405405405405405

1368089,2,B00004XPPF,"While the sappy story appealed to my grandchildren, they had a difficult time understanding what was said. Too often the background music drowned out the voices. The voices of the trains were very hard to understand and as were some of the live actors. About fifteen minutes into the movie, one grandson (age 9) asked, ""Are they always going to speak like that?"" I paid an extra dollar for the HD movie and it was not worth the extra cost.",1400976000,,439,4.5

If my son is going to watch Thomas shows, it would be nice to see people that he identifies with as well. Other children should see diversity in the cast as well to help their social skills and acceptance.

Our 2.5 year old was terrified of Diesel 10 and the rest of the movie left him completely confused. As an adult, I would rate it as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. Dark, completely bizarre, laughable acting and effects, poor script....and not even slightly related to the Thomas we all know and love. Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs.",1392940800,,559,4.6

1368121,4,B00004XPPF,"The story revolves around a ""lost"" steam engine...Diesel 10 wants to find it and destroy it, the steamies want to find it and save it. So there's a certain level of tension set up, plenty of opportunities for the ""bad guy"" to show up and be naughty, and plenty of heroics by Thomas and his steam engine friends.
Therefore, my five-year-old grandson loves this movie and wants to watch it at least once a week.

This is a lot more disappointing for the adults who have to watch this with the kids. The acting is a huge letdown, and really detracts from any enjoyability the movie could have. Alec Baldwin tries to carry the show, but everyone else seems to be wishing they were somewhere...anywhere...else. Peter Fonda shows all the emotional range of a plank of wood. Every line is delivered with the same blank face and the same monotone voice.",1390953600,,845,4.596026490066225
1368148,5,B00004XPPF,"How can a badly edited, tinnily written movie with the zombie-acting of Peter Fonda be worth 5 stars?

Because my boys, 7, 5, and 2 yrs old, love it. And don't just love it, but are mesmerized. The live action-collaboration with the old model railroad sets is adorable. The 7 yr old, who had long ago left behind Thomas for Ninjago and the Clone Wars, sat down with his middlest and littlest brother and hugged them as they watched. Then he said under his breath ""I Always Knew Thomas was real....."" The 5 and 2 have never doubted.

This live-action Thomas movie lets them Believe in the magic in a delightful way. And the tenth or so time I let them watch, I sat down with them and watched too. It isn't half bad, and it is even funny. Every time it seems too harrowing, it backs off just a bit and is safe again for preschoolers. They will love it.",1389916800,8,850,4.273291925465839

What can I say, it's cheesy and totally aimed for the kindergarten crowd, but completely appropriate for the age group even if mom's brain starts to shrink just hearing the music.

More funny in a laugh how pathetically bad it is kind of way. BUT, my four year old has loved this movie since the day we got it. In fact, I've been subjected to many, many viewings of this film to no avail. It's been TWO years now.

The best part when our son is joking around with us, is that he gets real serious, in an Alec Baldwin kind of way, and says 'Don't tell anyone about the buffers!', we then all laugh hysterically.

Thank god Alec's career got much better after this movie, we love, love(d) him in 30 Rock. But poor Peter Fonda, it's like he knows his acting career is over the entire film. Other reviewers have said it seems like he's suffering from depression; I too would be depressed if I knew this was as good as it gets for a highly successful actor in the final years. I wonder what casting agent duped him in to being in the film? I'm sorry Peter that you were even in this movie to begin with!

If you want a 'good' Thomas movie, go get Blue Mountain Quarry, and be prepared to shell out $20 and a bunch of time hunting for 'Luke'. We got him for our son, and just today there was a gigantic three-child tantrum at the local drop-in hall, as they all wanted the 'Luke'.

This movie would get a '""really useful"" at sucking hard' rating from Sir Topham Hatt. I'd recommend you didn't waste a dime on it, but your son might be odd like mine, and completely love it. He also loves Richard Scarry, Pingu & Bill Nye the Science Guy...so if your son or daughter likes those, go for it -- be prepared to lose 1 hour of your life, or more...

BTW Alec Baldwin, if you happen to read this: You read a eulogy at my Uncle Carleton's funeral on Long Island, thank you for that. Wish I had the chance to get to know how you two were friends!",1363132800,,1896,4.183561643835616

1368211,3,B00004XPPF,"First of all, this was one of the first few movies I saw in theaters so I'll always be thankfull for that. I remember enjoying it as a kid, but not getting all of the plot, and I remember enjoying thomas stuff when I was younger. So I thought I'd watch to actually learn the plot this time.

Coming away from it, I though it was a good kids movie, has characters and moments that will make them experience most ranges of emotion (humor, sadness, concernm/slightly scared and joy). The plot was fairly easy to follow and does a good job of making things between towns/universes come together. The human characters surprisingly played there roles pretty well at least for the target audience. Yes the film has moments that make me go ""OH JUST DO THIS"" reguarding certain parts of the film. Also there were several ""WHAT?"" moments and ""Oh yeah because it has to happen"" but, I have to remind myself ""This movie is not made for your age group."" The resolution was the best I could expect and I'm satisfied most kids will like this.
,
Now, as a Thomas movie, this really does not work. First of all the voices, James sounds like a woman and a b&#^# (I know he's made out to be one on show,but really give HIM a guy's voice), Percy sounds really pathetic in here and has no self confidence. From what I remmber about the show, we are supposed to be proud of his struggles and overcoming events in the show, here I have zero faith in him. Thomas appears to have lost his smarts in here, and goes through many accidents. REALLY? He's the main engine the one character that has a good perspective on everything, and here he's a mess at times and accomplishes basically nothing except deliver some laughs.

While the shout outs to other characters on the show are nice (the bus, Toby, Henrey and Gordon) the fact they are just there to be there for one or two scenes makes it not worth the effort (and you forgot edward). Henrey, Gordon and the Bus could've easilt been left out and Toby could've been replaced by James, which actually makes sense as when Junior finds the bad guy, James appears out of nowhere when Toby was the one actually nearby.

Also size comparisions between the universes are inconsistent, the conductors stay the same size in both universes, but the trains get bigger in the real world and other humans shrink in Sodar. That doesn't make sense. Also Mr. Conductor doesn't strike me as a good leader, advisor yes. The bitt of Shineing town becoming more negative hurts the tone of the movie and doesn't ever appear to be fully resolved with a reason. And finally the tone of the movie feels pretty different from other thomas stuff.

So ultimatly as a kids movie I think it works just fine, 4/5. As a thomas movie, I feel it sucks 2/5 (it is funny and the main action happens there), so 3/5 is my rating. I do want to rate it better but don't think I can.",1359849600,,2869,4.428030303030303

Frankly, I find it substandard on every category (acting, plot, set design, cohesiveness, special effects--you name it) but my grandson seems to find the blend of adventure, the mix of cartoon with live performance, and the conflict between the villain (Diesel 10) and the good guys tremendously exciting without being frightening. Now that he practically knows it by heart, he starts laughing even before whatever it is he finds hilarious actually happens.

I thought that this was just his preference, but a recent rainy day play date with two other little boys (ages 3 & 4) who had never seen it convinced me that this is the target audience and they all just loved it. This fact is what prompted me to write the review: my grandson is not an isolated case, the other little boys were just as excited about it and thought it was the best ever.

Hopefully, their tastes will improve with time and they will get more demanding in what they consider entertainment but, for the time being they all think this is the best Thomas movie in the world.

  ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad"" is not written or produced in the same spirit as Awdry's tales of good and bad behavior.  Good and bad must not have been dramatic enough for the sensibilities of the makers of this film, so they substituted a story of survival in the face of EVIL.  The staging and lighting of the film's villain makes Diesel #10 a railroad version of Darth Vader.  A ten year old would probably laugh all this off, but for years the Thomas series has been aimed at much younger viewers.  Watching one of the Sodor steam trains being threatened by a giant claw and pushed towards a firey pit freaks a six year old out.
  I made the parental mistake of leaving my child to watch this film by herself without previewing it, it was a Thomas movie after all.  I came back in in time to see the firey pit scene and stop the movie.  Unfortunately that wasn't early enough to keep my child from having nightmares of an evil, claw wielding, snarling, diesel engine.  It was a thematic ambush, and I hope other parents who read this will be smarter than I was, and screen the film first.

1368262,1,B00004XPPF,"We bought this for our 21-month-old for Christmas.  Words can not describe how bad this is.  First, let's highlight what is great about Thomas.

(1) There is always some sort of moral to each story.  Pride, prejudice, lying, there is always some sort of moral to each episode.  The characters each have faults, but each fault is resolved by the end of the story,

(2) The stories are slow, quiet, and gentle.  They are slightly more energetic than Mr Rogers, but as a parent, I'm more than happy to have a show that calms my kid down.

(3) You have a world, that in it's own cute and weird way, makes sense.  You have trains, you have people, and the trains (and buses) proudly serve the people.

So what was wrong with the movie?  I'll try to line these up with the points above.

(1) No moral whatsoever.  Heck, there was no plot, as far as I could tell.

(2) Killer Diesel.  Except for a train occasionally running off of a track or into an avalanche, there is no violence in Thomas.  I was horrified as I watched this with my 21-month-old to find that much of the story revolved around a murderous diesel engine!  The most you ever find in Thomas is a prank gone bad, not murder.  And it was graphic!  When I mean graphic, I mean Road Runner graphic, which is cool for the Road Runner, but isn't Thomas!  Imagine Mr. Rogers smashing someone with an anvil, and you get the picture.

(3) What the heck were real live people doing in this movie?  And what was the plot?  Was this was some bad acid trip, with the script made up on the spot?  That might make sense, as Peter Fonda seemed like he was on meds.

The majority of my experience is from watching Thomas on Sprout (PBS Kids). -- it's not the most exciting show, but it's cute, and it's perfect for my toddler.  Unlike other reviewers, I have no problems with the fat guy being called Sir Thopham Hat, nor do I have a problem with the proliferation of American accents (I'm a Yank, but I do realize that the Scottish twins should have a brogue, and I prefer the late George Carlin over the other narrators).  But I do have a problem with the voices used in this movie, as it makes the trains sound whiney and girly.  And what's with the Shiney Time station.  I vaguely remember that from some ex-nephews (as in sister of ex-wife) during the 90s, but that seemed horrid then.  I had forgotten the connection -- my (new wife) nephews were into Thomas 5 years ago, but that was because of Sprout.

I'm rambling, but the gist is that Thomas is cute, but this movie is a cynical cash-in.",1294444800,5,2541,4.3312101910828025

I also got a BIG kick out of the many very clever lines throughout the movie... whoever thought these jokes up, they surely had a great imagination and sense of humor!  Just one example of the many funny lines that comes to mind: the two smaller diesels are upbraiding the big bully, Diesel-10, for letting Mr. Conductor escape, and D-10 doesn't want to admit that Mr. Conductor escaped by cutting D-10's hydraulic hose, so D-10 pretends that he'd actually intended to let Mr. Conductor escape.  The other two diesels don't believe him, of course (it takes one to know one!), so they jeer back: ""Liar, liar!""  ""Pants on fire!""  ""Well, does he even WEAR pants?""

I have watched this movie MANY times now and some parts really make NO sense.  It is as though the writers gave up in some areas and said, ""Well, it's fantasy, it doesn't have to make sense!""

1368288,4,B00004XPPF,"Do you want to know why this movie is so bad? I'll tell you. Britt Allcroft had made a wonderful movie. It was really good. Oh, but then that stupid test audience had to butt in. Because of the test audience, several things were changed and we got the movie we did. Here are some things that were changed:

Thomas, Percy, and James' voices: Thomas was originally going to be voiced by John Bellis and Percy and James and (rumored) Gordon, were originally going to be voiced by Micheal Angelis(Yes, the same Micheal Angelis from New Friends for Thomas). They were dropped from their roles because the test audience complained that they made them sound too old. They were replaced with Eddie Glen(Thomas), Linda Ballantyne(Percy), and Susan Roman(James).

Deleted Character: There was a character called PT Boomer(played by Doug Lennox) who was supposed to be jealous of Burnett (because of Tasha, Burnett's wife). He was cut completely from the movie because the test audience said he was too scary for young children. Also, in the Director's Cut PT Boomer was the one who crashed Lady, not Diesel Ten. Boomer also rode on DTen's roof during the chase scene.

Deleted Song: There was a song called ""Some Things Never Leave You"" that was supposed to play during a flashback scene of Burnett and Tasha. Despite not appearing in the movie, it was included in the soundtrack album. Here's some trivia: If you watch the scene where Burnett is sitting in front of the fire place at his house, listen closely and you'll here ""Some Things Never Leave You"" playing in the backround.

Splode's voices: Splatter and Dodge were originally voiced by Patrick Breen.

Diesel Ten's voice: Diesel Ten's voice was changed several times. Keith Scott originally voiced him but was cut for sounding too scary. Neil Crone then originally voiced Diesel in a Russian accent. But for some reason I don't really understand, he had to change it to an American voice.

More Trivia: Mutt put Lily on the wrong train to keep her safe from PT Boomer, Lily was suposed to narrate the movie not Mr. C.

Several other things were deleted that I probably don't even know about. Because people blamed Britt Allcroft for the failure(even though it wasn't her fault) she was fired from her own company. If you all want to see the Director's Cut go onto [...], click on Thomas and the Magic Railroad button, then click on Director's Cut campaign, and sign the petition to have the Director's Cut released.

I got all my information from [...]. Don't forget to put a hyphen in between sodor and island.

  Update

Actually, forget everything I just said. Yes, this is all true, but the Director's cut has temporary music from other movies so the composer gets an idea of what to do. Because of this and copyright issues, there will be no director's cut. Yes, they can replace the temporary music, but it would cost a lot.

But don't lose hope. They may put the deleted scenes with the temporary music removed on the special features of a possoble tenth anniversary DVD. But don't get your hopes up. They might, and they might not. Let's just hope they do.

It's as if they all took acid when they put this together. I agree - the plot is hard to follow and the acting, well, STINKS! Peter Fonda looks as if he took Valium the whole time. Perhaps he did - it might have made it more bearable for him.

I will say this - my son loves watching this, but I am convinced his taste is suspended in order to enjoy the temporary ""demise"" of Diesel 10. If not, I have no hope for his future in the creative arts.

1368296,1,B00004XPPF,"This movie is just wrong...the acting is terrible and the plot is nonsensical.  There is no excuse for such awful movie-making.  Yes, even for kids.

Worst of all, it is completely false to the spirit of the Thomas stories and original series.  The movie actually features an evil villain -- rare-to-nonexistent in the real Thomas stories, where the baddies learn their lessons and quickly become goodies.  One of the charms of the Sodor of the books is that none of the trains are all bad, and all of them are basically upstanding and want nothing but to be Really Useful Engines.  The Thomas engines in this turkey are made to say things roughly in character but still totally tone deaf.  They're caricatures.  The narrator has an American accent, and the engines are given very annoying voices, unlike the good old fashioned British productions.  It mixes live actors, who are apparently somewhere in a magical part of the United States.  Alec Baldwin plays a sort of fairy creature.  A train is hidden inside a mountain, and is called not by English names like Emily but the Disneyesque ""Lady.""  That just gives you a little notion.  Apparently the plot involves ""magical gold dust,"" but I admit I didn't finish watching the movie so I never found out how.  But in the books, Sodor is not magical, it is not a fairy tale.  It's a regular place...it just happens to have engines that talk.  It interfaces with the real world, not via a magic portal, but via bridges and ferries.

This movie is not Thomas the Tank Engine.  This is Americanized, Disneyfied excuse to make a buck--well, that's not fair, because most American children's and Disney theatrical releases are not this bad.  Whoever is responsible for this turkey knows nothing about Thomas or why kids love him.  They just wanted to make a quick buck, that's all.  It's a slap in the face to those who like and appreciate Thomas.

My little boy is absolutely crazy about Thomas, but he couldn't watch more than 10-15 minutes of this garbage.",1219536000,3,2005,4.734104046242774

""Well, first of all, Alec Baldwin was a tiny train conductor... "" :)

Here's how the movie goes, in my opinion. This American Indian with long braids finds a child's drawing of a boy and recognizes the child in the drawing. There's a guy with a train in a cave. At some point a little girl follows a dog and gets on the wrong train and then gets in a car with a STRANGER to go to her grandfather's house. She climbs trees but can't ride a horse, then there is a lot of magical bouncing back and forth, including one part where Thomas sees a boxcar full of coal, presumably on a another track because he goes flying by it, and then when he screeches to a halt to go back to get it, it is mysteriously on the same track as him so he can couple right up to it. Even the kids watching thought that was crazy.

Towards the end, Peter Fonda inexplicably and with no context at all waves his fist and shouts ""Green for Glory!"" which put all the adults in the room into stitches.

The value this movie has is that it is so completely ridiculous you can make fun of it for a solid 85 minutes. The rest of it is so bizarro, so disjointed, and completely ridiculous... well, just don't torture yourself.",1219449600,8,1348,4.193050193050193

It seems like the producers took words like gold.dust.dog.railroad.friends.magic.grandpa.horse because they knew that those words were popular with viewers and mixed them randomly into a story and hoped for the best.

They also deviated from the concept in the Thomas films that there is some not-so-nice-behaviour involved but nothing more drastic. Diesel is not ""Not-so-nice"", he is downright evil and destructive. This garbage is not for young kids.

There exist two worlds,  The ""real world"" of Shining Time has real trains, aging childhood actors, a sad Peter Fonda and an indian (which never gets explained).  The other world is the Island of Sodor which is a dying magical universe (even though this is never mentioned in any of the book or tv shows), has the familar ""model"" Thomas trains, a miniature Alec Baldwin as Mr C. and a partying ""surfer dude"" who plays his cousin.

Sir Top Ham Hat is oddly absent and in his charge is Mr. C who's conductor's outfit looks like somehting from a 60's acid trip.  Mr C can travel between the two worlds by blowing gold dust out of his conductor's whistle.

First off, my son (5 years) was let down when he realized this movie is full of live actors. Too much human, not enough Thomas and friends for sure. There is also an ""evil diesel"" that my son found scary. (The film contains an ""evil"" sub-plot which is not something I recall seeing in the other Thomas stories.) Still, he did watch it several times before we returned it to the movie store.

You may think that with Alec Baldwin, Peter Fonda, and even Russel Means, it would be pretty interesting entertainment for adults as well. Think again. I cannot describe to you the bizarre acting that goes on in this movie. Didi Conn is the best thing going on here, too bad she only has a few short scenes; the other actors all seem to be on different drugs.

Peter Fonda, what happened? Alec Baldwin, in all fairness, probably fares about as well as anyone possibly could given this script.

Which brings me to the biggest problem of all...the story.

Here's what I mean...lots of this type of dialogue:

""UNLESS...we can figure out how to find the lost train that can go through the secret passageway to the magic world and we can find Lily and then figure out how to find the source of our family's gold dust...but if we don't find Diesel in time to figure out a plan to stop him from destroying the magic buffers that will trap the lost train in Muffle Mountain and lose all the gold dust forever AND trap Lily...BUT FIRST we have to figure out how to FIX the lost engine named Lady which won't run and hasn't run for 50 years...""

If you think I'm exaggerating, I am. But not by much.

You could re-name it ""Thomas: Contorted and Convoluted.""

But it won't offend anyone, it's fine for kids (except for the scary diesel with his menacing claw-like grabber arm...), and it may cure insomnia.

I'd rent it though. This is one I'm glad to not own.

Best Regards,

Jack

P.S. One more thing. It contains some GREAT lines like ""Yes...because of Lily"" and ""Oh, Lily"" and ""See that switch over there on the wall...flip it on"" from the great Peter Fonda.",1135209600,10,2337,4.486997635933806

1368334,3,B00004XPPF,"It seems that many of the reviews here are out-of-context, because the reviewers may not be familiar with the ""Shining Time Station"" series.  Shining Time Station is the program which introduced Thomas and his friends to many folks.  But after STS left PBS for Nickelodian, PBS was left with just Thomas.

In Shining Time Station, the role of Mr Conductor is fairly important.  He is constantly interacting with folks like Stacey Jones (who is in this movie for a few scenes), Billy Two-Feathers (also in the movie and drives the 'real' train), and the infamous Schemer (notably absent).  He is also the central figure for telling the children who hang around the station about Thomas and the Land of Sodor.  Depending on season, Mr C was played by either Ringo Starr or George Carlin.  It is supposed to be a somewhat responsible - yet somewhat wacky - role, as is everything about Shining Time Station.  Alec Balwin clearly studied this role closely based on his predecessors, and I thought did an outstanding job.

OTOH, words can not describe how dreadful Peter Fondas performance was.  He seemed to be completely lost in every scene he was in.  He seemed to have no concept of Shining Time Station at all.  It dragged down the entire movie.

As has been noted in other reviews, small kids won't be able to figure out the plot.  By the time kids start figuring it out (say, age 9) they are starting to get too old for some of the movie.

The musical interludes are wonderful.  Check out some of the samples from the Amazon page for the Sound Tracks CD.  (And yes, Locomotion did appear in the movie - during the credits.)

To a rail buff, such as myself, there were some wonderful shots of the steam train taking Lily (Mara Wilson) to Shining Time Station.  FWIW, engine #475 - prominently photographed in the movie - belongs to the Strasburg Railroad in Strasburg, Pa.  If you have a good sound system, #475s 'CHUG' and whistle send chills up ones spine.

There were a few railroading problems too.  Like how did the coal car that got lost through the buffer end up on a different set of tracks than Thomas was on?  Or how did Thomas get turned around after he fell off the cliff?  How did Patch manage to bring hundreds of lbs of coal back - on his horse - to fire up Lady?  Or during the chase scene with Lady, how did Diesel suddenly switch from the left tracks to the right tracks?  Kids won't notice any of that of course.

So in summary, if your kids have seen the Shining Time Station series, it will make some sense to them and why the characters are as they are.  If they know about Thomas but have not seen STS, the Mr Conductor (and Stacey Jones and Billy Two-Feathers) characters will be new and a bit, er, different.  If they've never seen either one, the movie probably will have a hard time standing on its own - at least for the first couple of viewings.",1123372800,9,2875,4.475
1368335,1,B00004XPPF,"I was so excited to get this movie for my brother who loves Thomas and knows everything a three year old can know about trains.  I only wish I had read a couple of reviews first.  I almost did not buy it just because Alec Baldwin was in it and after seeing this movie, I'll never waste another dime on anything he is in.

So why is this movie so bad?  Let's start with the story.  It has more to do with Mr. Conductor (a stupid name) than it has to do with Thomas and his friends.  The dialogue is horrible. When it does show an engine from the Island of Sodor, it bears no resemblence to the engines in the beloved books.  For instance, James comes across as an idiot.  Thomas is nearly absent for most of the movie.  The voices of the engines sound like little kids, which is silly.  On the other hand the character played by Mara Wilson should have been played by a little kid.  She is very unconvincing in this role and the boy, Patch is even worse.  Some characters seem to be there for no reason at all, like Mr. Conductor's cousin.  But that is the way the entire movie goes, things just happen for no reason, leaving the viewer with a bunch of annoying questions:  Why is Diesel 10 so angry and mean?  Why does Mr. conductor go from the ""real"" world to the Island of Sodor?  Why would Sir Topham Hatt trust this simpleton to run his railroad?  Why was Peter Fonda's character able to get to Sodor in the first place?  Why was this movie ever made?  Why did nobody check in with the original stories to see if any of this made sense?  Why was Britt Allcroft allowed to do this kind of damage to Thomas the Tank Engine?  Why am I so angry about this?  Did they show this movie to a test audience?  If so how did it ever make it to theaters?

In short, this is THE WORST movie I have ever seen from the screenplay to the acting to the editing.  It has not one redeeming quality.",1114128000,18,1883,4.1353591160221

I still enjoy watching it with my child.  It is a great children's video and I would buy it as a gift for other Thomas fans.

After watching the standard Thomas DVD's (over and over again) I think he mostly enjoys the fact that Thomas and his friends are interacting with real people.  There are real people riding in the trains and real people on the Island of Sodor which is a welcome change to the wooden ones whose mouths don't move :)  It is also neat to see a lot of different trains and hear them talking (Toby, Annie and Clarabel all talk for instance) which never happens in the regular DVD's.

I will admit that the only thing worse than the story (which is totally confusing) is the acting.  Peter Fonda is so bad you will actually laugh out loud.  But in the end it is the trains that are the real stars of this movie and if you have a Thomas fan in the house - you won't regret spending the $9.99 (less than the price of one train) to add this one to your DVD collection.",1106179200,9,1131,4.136986301369863
1368340,1,B00004XPPF,"My son, who is almost three, is the quintissential Thomas fan.  He watches the videos over and over, quotes dialogue, acts out the stories, and I've lost count of how many Thomas engines and accessories he has.

He can't stand this movie!

He was first introduced to Thomas by a promo for this movie on one of his Bear in the Big Blue House videos.  He was so fascinated by Thomas that he'd watch the Bear movie just to see the promo.  We bought him a couple of Thomas videos, and he was hooked.  When he finally got the Thomas Movie on a special occasion, he was thrilled -- until he actually watched it.  It's nothing like his ""Thomas & Friends"" videos.

And that's the problem -- this isn't really a ""Thomas"" movie at all; it's a ""Shining Time Station Movie.""  And since my son has never seen ""Shining Time Station"" (he was born well after PBS dropped the show) he has no idea who ""Mr. Conductor"" is, or ""Stacey Jones"" -- and he's never seen live actors interact with the engines on the Island of Sodor!  He watched it once; he still has it, but he's not at all interested in seeing it again.  He seems to find it disturbing...

If your child remembers Shining Time Station, he (or she) will probably like this movie.  But then again, if your kid remembers Shining Time Station, he (or she) is probably too old for Thomas.  It probably won't appeal to kids who have only been exposed to the Thomas & Friends videos.

Maybe that's why it's selling (or not) for less than $10.  Unfortunately, Amazon's review system won't let me give it less than one star.",1105228800,6,1557,4.391608391608392

I truely enjoyed watching this with my son.  It is a wonderful movie for young children!!  Other reviewers have gone on and on about how terrible Peter Fonda's acting is.  To me, I don't see what the big deal is, he is not seen in that much of the movie until the end.  And as another reviewer pointed out this is a child's movie. Kids don't care how well he acts... They are only watching to see the trains.

As for Diesel 10, when he first appeared in the movie my 3 year old (only been 3 a couple of weeks)laughed.  He did not seem bothered at all until the end when Diesel is chasing Thomas and Lady.  Even then, all he did was scream go faster Thomas.  So unless you have a really sensitive child, I think that most little ones can tolerate him.  Let's face it, there are much worse and scarier villians in other children's programs than Diesel 10.

Several reviews said the plot doesn't make sense or it is all over the place.  I just have to plain disagree.  It made perfect sense to me.  I did not find myself lost as to what was going on at any time during this movie.  It does not have your typical Thomas plots that teach a moral lesson with little 4 or 5 minute segments.  However, there are plenty lessons to be learned throughout the course of the movie, such as have courage, good triumphs over evil, don't give up...etc... So I am not sure why so many had such negative things to say about ""the moral lessons"".

I am accustomed to watching movies repeatedly with my son, and I must say that I believe this one will be easier to sit through than some of the others that I have suffered through over and over!! Buy this because it is worth every penny.",1102982400,3,1809,4.194202898550724

I have been a Thomas fan for many years but after watching this one I'd tell buyers pass up this one. Spend it on GOOD videos or DVDs such as Thomas Comes to Breakfast, Thomas & His Friends Get Along, or Trust Thomas. This is the worst Thomas production. Lady, Splatter, and Dodge were never seen after this. It dosen't show characters such as: Edward, Duck, Oliver, Donald, Douglas, Bill, Ben, Stepney, Trevor, Terance Cranky, Mavis, and BoCo. Even the recently released Steamies VS. Diesels is better than this. Alec Baldwin does his best in this movie. His best Thomas productions were: Cranky Bugs, Races Rescues & Runaways, Spills & Chills, Make Someone Happy, Gordon & the Gremlin (indivisual episode from Trackside Tunes), and this.

When the movie was released, I watched it at home and I wasn't all that impressed.  The basic storyline was pretty well thought out but it didn't seem like a regular Thomas storyline.  Some of the children nowadays would think it is boring and simply terrifying with the exception of Diesel 10.  The majority of the children have watched the show and videos and learned that Thomas is a innocent, friendly, and a hard worker.  When you put a evil train into the mix, it doesn't seem right.  The original Diesel used to cause trouble out in the yards etc., but this one didn't fit.  Overall the storyline isn't all that bad, but the they could have had better acting and more train scenes instead of the humans.  I mean it is Thomas's movie.

I am sorry to say that in typical boy fashion, he recently decided he had to prove he was not afraid of Diesel and asked me to get this for him.  I did, and now I feel like I should be carried screaming from the room.
The plot, such as it is, is incoherent and completely contrary to the purpose of the original Thomas stories, which were all about hard work, determination, teamwork and honesty.  Very bland unmagical Anglo-Saxon qualities, but good ones to have and good ones to teach to your children.  This movie, on the other hand, seems to have nothing to do with those corny virtues and everything to do with the Conductor's quest for some sort of magic gold dust.
The acting is leaden, but I don't know that the actors themselves are to blame. I'm sure they were all expecting a better script.  Honestly this film seems to have more in common with The Beatles' ""Magical Mystery Tour"" than it does with any of the previous Thomas stories.  It's sloppy, disjointed, with all sorts of weird hallucinogenic touches, like the conductor talking into a phone made of flowers.
The story also seems to make my son very hyper (something the original Thomas stories never did) -- he even seems to have more trouble sleeping if he watches it.

Mr. C is a tiny little guy who magically pops in and out using gold dust. Gold dust is the only way to travel to the Island of Sodor and it's running out. And to make things worse a nasty Diesel engine is running amok threatening the steam engines. Hence the plot of this movie.
I have to agree with almost all of the other reviews-- for the most part the acting stinks, but my kids love it. They want to watch it nearly every day. They love to watch the ""choo-choo's"". Because of that I gave it 4 stars.
From an adult perspective I would give it 2 stars, only because of Alec Baldwin. If it weren't for Baldwin this movie would have nothing for the adults to watch. He is absolutely hillarious as Mr. Conductor. He plays the part perfectly. The only other good acting comes from C Jr., Mr. C's nephew (don't know his real name), who plays a funny British surfer-dude. On the other hand Peter Fonda's acting is so bad, it would be funny if he weren't so annoying. He plays Burnett Stone, a sad-sack old recluse who never comes down from the mountain and now I see why. If he did come down he would be pelted with rocks.
This movie is full of stupid dialog and situations. One of the more stupid moments in this movie: A girl asking a stray dog what train to get on and where to get off.

I know none of the drivers in the story ever had names besides Edward's driver being called Charlie once but Mr Conductor could've called them Sir or Driver or not really address them at all. Second I thought Edward should've been in it. Edward was one of the oringinal engines from the first tape and he could've had a small part. Next I thought it was weird how Thomas would leave Annie and Clarabel in the middle of the line where another engine could run into them.

Rodgers (Mr. C. Junior), and the best scenes are between these two actors.  I also believe Michael E. Rodgers brings out the best in Mara Wilson's acting.  Peter Fonda's acting is questionable, but all in all this is a very entertaining and high-quality movie for the whole family.  The trains have new voices and facial expressions that fit their personalities perfectly, and the music is whimsical and of excellent quality.  I adore the concept of the magic railroad, and this movie has sparked hours of imaginative play in my son.  He now has his own gold dust and uses his bed to travel down the magic railroad.  Once again, Michael E. Rodgers completely lights up the film with his humour and uninhibited acting style.  I can't wait to see more of these Thomas films!",1069200000,3,998,4.651428571428571

He meets a new enchanting character, Lady, whose chugging spins out the railroad's magical energy, gold-dust.  There's a villainous train, Diesel 10, who is just scary enough for a youngster.
The movie is great for young kids, so why are all the adults critiquing it from our adult expectations of entertainment?  Yeah, Peter Fonda is so flat that I wish he'd go drop some acid.  And the child actors are horrible--and given preposterous lines to say.  It looks like there was all of a $50 budget for the movie.  But in spite of that, Thomas is just plain magical for kids.

I had read that purist Thomas fans didn't care for it, but since we don't have any of the regular videos, I figured it would be okay. What I didn't realize is that there are relatively few scenes of the trains in this video, and my son found the extended dialog between the ""real"" people to be completely uninteresting. He would actually walk away from the TV, he was so bored.
As an adult, I found the plot to be overly complicated with too many sub elements. The boy and girl characters appear to have been shoe-horned in for a little human interest, but are tedious to watch. Alec Baldwin provides a perfomance that is so bad, I couldn't look at the screen. Peter Fonda didn't do so well either.

Peter Fonda appears heavily sedated throughout the film.  The character Junior (who for no apparent reason seems to be an Aussie surfer dude) is energetic but lost to the pathetic script and direction.

Although I understand the story all right, it looks like it would be confusing to very young children considering that it needs gold dust to get into the Island of Sodor.  Compared to the original Thomas, this is a horrible movie.  If you are considering getting it, I recommend that you get one of the original Thomas videos because I believe your child will enjoy that much more.  Although some kids may like it, I personally don't like it at all.  It takes ideas away from the original Thomases and it has real people which makes them become the stars and not the trains.

Audrey's stories, and now thinks she is capable of reproducing it.  I have a feeling she meant well, but there is no rhyme or reason to this movie.
Here are the first 15 minutes - A Diesel is terrorizing the trains.  No, it's about a girl in the city with a stuffed bird.  No, it's about an old man with an engine in a cave.  No, it's about Mr. Conductor losing his gold dust.  No, it's about Mr. Conductor's nephew who is a beach bum.  At this point, my three year old demanded we leave the theatre.
Even though it is for kids, it should have a story that can be followed - logically.  But instead, random events and explantions occur, and you must accept it.  If there were no people in it, it would be far better.  When the engines are on screen, it is very good.  But the acting is horrendous - especially Peter Fonda.  The trains have better facial expressions as well as personality.
My son, now 4, received the video for his birthday.  As a kid who watches Nickelodeon and PBS, he has been brainwashed by corporate tv.  He watches this video constantly.  I believe kids just love trains, especially Thomas, and will watch anything to do with the Thomas franchise, no matter what the packaging.

Not to mention how un-entertaining the movie was for my 4 1/2 year old (who begs to watch and watch his other train videos) he did not care if he saw this one entirely or not. What was worse was how frightened our 2 1/2 year old was by Diesel. I would have given this 0 stars if that option were available. Buy any Thomas Video BUT this one!

The story line is very easy to follow for small children, typical of all Thomas episodes - no complicated plots, no surprises, no thinking!

7926105,4,B00004XPPF,"Going to the movies has always been something special for us. Over the last century, people have gone to the cinema to relieve themselves of reality and relax somewhere better, somewhere where we don't have to think about the worries and cares of what society is like around us. Movies provide us an insight to why society is complicated and everything we have to understand about the human condition. We are told stories about our world and why certain things happen in it and why certain people behave the way they do. Additionally, movies consist of many different genres, ranging from adult films, to comedies, to dramas, to family films, the list goes on. Every time we go to the cinema, we always have the choice of choosing which would be our favorite film(s) of the year.

Thomas And The Magic Railroad just so happens to be one of my all-time favorite films; being one of those few films I remember watching in my childhood and how its become a personal favorite of mine. It is my favorite Thomas movie; yet it is a film that I feel has become critically underrated since its theatrical release back in July, 2000. It intertwines the ""Thomas The Tank Engine"" TV show and its American spinoff ""Shining Time Station"" into one big movie, taking place between the Island of Sodor over in the UK and the Indian Valley in the USA, with Thomas and his engine friends being left in the care of Mr. Conductor (played by Alec Baldwin) while Sir Topham Hatt/The Fat Controller and his family leave for a much-needed summer holiday. Trouble begins a-brewing when a wicked diesel-engine named Diesel 10 arrives on the Island with an evil scheme to get rid of Thomas and all of the other steam-engines so that he can conquer the Island of Sodor with diesel-domination. At the same time, in the Indian Valley, a young girl named Lily (played by Mara Wilson) is traveling to Muffle Mountain to visit her grandfather, Burnett Stone (played by Peter Fonda), a retired railroad engineer who has shut himself out of the world because he has tried to repair an engine named Lady (who belongs to Mr. Conductors family), to no avail.

I remember seeing the film five times when I was a kid, and every time I went to see it, I remember loving every minute of it. It was just a wondrous joy seeing the ""Thomas"" characters and the Shining Time Station characters come together and interact with one another for the very first time.

Now when it comes to movies that you remember watching during you childhood, when you get older, theres always going to be a few of them that you will look back at and sometimes you'll find if they either still hold up or are not as good as you first remember it. Thomas And The Magic Railroad is one of those movies that isn't as good as I remember it. But despite that, it still has a special place in my heart. Even a movie that isn't as good as you first remember it can still hold up in a way where the good stuff about it shines the most.

The only nitpick that I have is that I didn't really enjoy Alec Baldwin playing the role of Mr. Conductor. Now I know that there are some people in the Thomas community who do like his narrations and I do understand that he was narrating the TV series at the time that the film was in production, but I just didn't feel that into his portrayal of Mr. Conductor. I'm not saying that he did a bad job, it's just that he seemed to lack the charm, passion, and enthusiasm that Ringo Starr and the late George Carlin both had when they did the role in the Shining Time Station TV series. I do give him credit for at least trying, but his performance just didn't do it for me. I can just wonder if the film would have done a little better if either Ringo Starr or George Carlin had reprised the role instead.

As for the rest of the cast, I loved how they brought back Didi Conn as Stacey Jones; the stationmaster of Shining Time Station. I personally cant think of anybody else who could've taken on the role other than her. She is the one who brought Stacey to life in the show and it was nice to see her reprising the role again. While it was disappointing that Tom Jackson didn't get to reprise his role of Billy Twofeathers, I did like how the late Russell Means proved to be a great successor to the role and keeping true to the spirit of that character.

Additionally, I personally found this film to be one of Mara Wilson's best roles that she was able to do (despite that it was the last film that she did before she retired from acting) because I saw her playing a character that separated her from all of the child characters that she previously played. Here, she gets to play the character of Lily Stone, whom we see as a young girl who goes through a strong sense of change as she wishes to bring her Grandpa out of his depression and back into the light and specialty of life  in other words, she saves him from giving up on life, which is important because we live on this Earth to help each other. There are people out there in the world who are strongly depressed for whichever reasons why and its our job to get them the best help that they need. Its our job to make life better for those around us and thats one of the things that I strongly appreciate about Magic Railroad; because it presents those kinds of things within its storyline.

This film was also my introduction to Peter Fonda. Even though I haven't seen any of his other films, I was actually impressed that he was able to take on a role that not only separated him from all of his previous roles, but as a role that he wanted to play for a long time: the role of a grandfather. If the late Wilbert Awdry was alive today, I personally believe that this would be something he would actually be able to relate to; considering the fact that he, too, became a grandfather himself. Think about it.

What I love the most is the heart of Thomas And The Magic Railroad. There are one or two things that I can see that make the heart of the entire movie. Even if not many people can see it, I had no problem(s) seeing where the heart of the movie was:

1. The first thing that makes the heart of the movie goes to the characters of Lily Stone and her grandfather, Burnett Stone. We see Lily wanting to reconcile with her grandfather; who has been separated from the family for a very long time. We see the grandfather-granddaughter relationship as something that is incredibly strong and as something very meaningful because the importance of family plays a key role in everybodys life and thats part of why Magic Railroad is a very personal film to me because its one of those very few films that teaches us that; because that's what Thomas has now become ---- part of so many families across the world. One of Britt Allcroft (the TV creator of the Thomas TV series)s intentions for the film was to showcase the bond between a child and their grandparents. Grandparents play a very special role in the lives of children everywhere, so I knew that this was something not just important but also extremely special to the storyline of Magic Railroad; because I remember seeing the film with my two grandmothers and that was something very special because I shared my childhood experiences of Thomas and Shining Time Station (and, of course, Disney) with them the most, so I knew that this would be something that would truly stand out a lot for me and, to my big surprise, it did do exactly that and even my two grandmothers were amazed by it, too, and even they were impressed with Peter Fondas portrayal of playing the role of a grandparent, so I knew that these key elements were some of the best things about the movie. Like I said before, if the late Wilbert Awdry was alive today, Im positively sure that he would have strongly identified with these key elements in the storyline, considering the fact that he, too, was a grandfather himself. Think about it.

2. The second thing that makes the heart of the movie goes to the music, composed by the talented Hummie Mann  the sounds of his inspirational and passionate music makes the heart of the movie soar high. Whether its the music itself or even the songs, like the Shining Time Station song, I Know How The Moon Must Feel, or Some Things Never Love You, you can tell that the music is one of many major parts of what brings out the best in the movie. Others like The Locomotion and the orchestral version of Really Useful Engine are also highly memorable, too.

If theres one of many things that I strongly appreciate about Thomas And The Magic Railroad, it would have to be how it tackles more serious life elements than in the original Railway Series books. What I mean by this is while Wilbert Awdrys books dealt more about how railways work and life lessons for children, this movie takes the opportunity to go beyond the limits of Awdrys books to tell a much bigger story that dealt with more serious life elements like dealing with the loss of a loved one (i.e. a family member) as well containing as some strong adult drama.
Like I previously said, we live on this Earth to help each other, and its our job to get everybody the best help that they need, especially for the people who are strongly depressed for whichever reasons why. Life is something special and shouldn't be taken for granted and that's something that we all have to remember. All of these serious life elements are important to know and remember and I don't remember any of Wilbert Awdrys books dealing with these kinds of things and that's mainly why I personally prefer the TV show a lot more because it can do so much more that the original books weren't able to do on their own. If Wilbert Awdry was alive today, I personally believe that all of this would be something he would actually either appreciate or be rather impressed about. Think about it.

Out of the sequences of the entire film, my favorite is none other than the climatic chase scene near the end. Out of all the scenes in the film, this is definitely the best part. Combined with the frantic, yet magnificent music by Hummie Mann and the fast-paced visuals and train-modeling skills of Thomas director David Mitton, everything just blends in together beautiful, even in the original version of the climatic chase scene with P.T. Boomer (which can be found on YouTube).

While I do enjoy some of the full-length specials, like The Great Discovery and Sodors Legend Of The Lost Treasure; even they cant surpass this movie. Despite its complications in the final version, I find ""Magic Railroad"" to be far more superior to Calling All Engines and Misty Island Rescue because those specials weren't all that good since they depended on pointless learning segments, awful alliteration, painfully constant rhyming, etc. Thomas And The Magic Railroad, however, had its heart in the right place and thats what we moviegoers mostly expect to have as long as its well-executed and is one of the film's key elements that comes out strong and powerful as were watching it. If you're a Thomas fan and/or have heard of and/or watched Shining Time Station; then I believe this film is worthy of a recommendation. Feel free to give it a watch. Trust me, it won't hurt.
