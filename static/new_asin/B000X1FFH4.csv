8623976,3,B000X1FFH4,"If you want to watch a great travel show watch Passport to Europe or anything with Samantha Brown, but if you want some fun, light fare this will do.  This DVD had three locations: Vancouver, BC, Seattle and Portland.  What was interesting is how little they focus on the main attractions of each city and just get so into the gay scene only of each city.  The one problem I have with this show is they tend to spend way too much time on each club or coffee house or cupcake parlor they visit instead of moving on.  That does cause it to feel a bit like it's dragging on at times.  I'd prefer they try not to be ""silly"" in their presentation and just give some facts.  They don't even show a map of where the cities are located or where the neighborhoods are they are discussing, and it would be nice to hear about several choices in places to stay and eat, but again they focus on one hotel or restaurant way too long.  But it's nice to see such a show so I'm not going to rate it lower than 3 stars.",1211587200,,1001,4.102564102564102
