7788518,5,0764820516,I work with the PRE and RCIA programs at my Parish. I was looking for a more standard approach that would provide a foundation and review for the youth. This hit the spot. I have used it for both the youth and their parents.,1432339200,2,224,4.113636363636363
7788519,5,0764820516,"I work at a Catholic church and bought this video to show to our First Communion class after our VHS copy of ""A Child's First Communion"" wore out.  I saw this newer version and decided to give it a try.  It contains the classic video of Fr Joe talking to little Adam about the Eucharist as well as a bunch of more modern segments that would be great showing children and groups of parents.  Fr. Joe has aged in this video but he is the same likeable, great guy.",1336003200,6,461,4.157303370786517
