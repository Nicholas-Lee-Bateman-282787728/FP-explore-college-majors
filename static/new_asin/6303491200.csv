684912,4,6303491200,"Note: my review may contain spoilers related to the films story, but my general review is for the DVD & general entertainment value of the movie

It's the story of a Kansas high school cheerleader that grows restless & tired of her normal life in Kansas so she moves to Los Angeles in the hopes of becoming a real model, but instead she falls into the adult film industry. with that said you can almost guess how it turns out, but it's still sad to see how a nice young girl spins out of control in this bio-pic made for TV movie

I think of it as sort of a cautionary tail of what not to do when your young, the movie was made in during the late 80's so you'll notice a lot of 80's hair & clothing styles, the look of the movie kind of reminds me of an old 50's or 60's sitcom because of the lighting & I feel that the low budget photography style makes the film look a bit cheesy, & cheap lol, but after you stop thinking about that, & get into the story & remember that the story is based on a real persons life you realize it's really a fascinating & also sad story and it's quite good, keep in mind this movie is rare & difficult to find on other popular sites

About the DVD the picture quality is good considering how long ago the movie was made, also note there are no extras in this DVD, I guess those that enjoy this movie should be thankful it was even released on DVD because there are so many movies of it's type that didn't get a proper DVD release I could name several films & made for TV movies that were forgotten & should have been released on Blu-ray & DVD, lastly if you are curious about this movie or you already appreciated this movie here's you chance to buy it.",1359158400,2,1686,4.087613293051359

684915,5,6303491200,I was so happy to see this movie on DVD.  I had taped it off of a TV Network-so had commercials in it.

684917,3,6303491200,"This is a 1998 TV movie portrayal of a porn star's life, so it has to be very tame to show on prime time.  They do a pretty good job at it, but it doesn't show much of what a porn star really does.  Like a PG rated porn movie!  Also, all the character names are changed to random names, so it seems more like fiction than portraying the real life of Colleen Applegate, aka Shauna Grant.  They, however, are not shy about showing the cocaine flying free, which is typical of porn stars' lives.  What's hard to believe is showing her often visiting her family in Minnesota, hoping that they will accept her porn life--no way.  It also does not show much of her motivation to suicide.  Her problems didn't seem to be anywhere near that bad to warrant it.  It's a good movie, and if you are a fan of the porn business, it is a must see, but it would have been much more realistic if it were R Rated.",1297123200,,895,4.132947976878612
684918,4,6303491200,"This film has played on Lifetime, and I have watched it twice. It was originally played as a movie of the week on network tv. I could be wrong?. It was filmed in the eighties. (I was a youngin during this time, so my mom would not have let me watch this on tv.) It's not one of those PREACHY 80s movies. I give it a solid B.

685073,3,6303491200,"This film depicts Colleen`s life pretty well. From a person who new her and lived not to far from her I never really knew she was into Porn because most of the films did not even appear on the shelf for purchase/rental until early 1984. I had hoped for a more extensive film yet something is better than nothing at all. As far as Warner`s Product, Not very impressive, a DVDR, and most likely a Limited Life DVDR, knowing the studio`s intent from their past performance. The film transfer is Good, but not exceptional, again why would this studio put more money into something than they had to just to get it out there, typical Studio execs. God Bless you and your`s Colleen.",1415664000,,675,4.495934959349594
685074,5,6303491200,"I first saw this movie on TV years ago, and was intrigued by the story of ""Pauleen Anderson"".
Later I learned that the character depicted in this film was actually based on Colleen Applegate, an adult film star who killed herself in 1984 at 20 years old after battling severe drug addiction and depression.  Many liberties were taken with the characters in ""Shattered Innocence"" but it remains fairly true to actual events/people.
Pauleen Anderson (played by Jonna Lee) is a cute blue-eyed blonde from a small town in Kansas.  She is the oldest child in a family that resembles something like ""The Sound of Music"".  She has an overbearing but well-meaning mother and a somewhat ineffectual but loving father.  Pauleen seems to have a restless spirit...she is bored by her mundane existence in small-town rural America.  She wants to be somebody, and to her, that can only happen if she heads to Hollywood.  It is obvious early in the film that she has conflict with her parents, particularly her mother (Melinda Dillon) who simply wants her to conform to certain rules and standards of behavior.

After being fired from her job at the phone company, Pauleen decides to venture to California with her boyfriend.  Discouraged at being unable to find work, she notices an ad in the newspaper and goes to a modeling agency in Los Angeles.  But she soon discovers that this isn't just the typical modeling agency...this involves shedding her clothes.  When her boyfriend and her family learn the truth, they are shocked and angry; her parents actually fly out to California to confront Pauleen's agent and Pauleen herself, but to no avail.
The strong-willed young woman refuses to come home.  She moves in with her close friend and makeup artist, another porn actress (played by Nadine van der Velde).  Pauleen is suddenly living life in the fast lane...caught up in a dizzying whirlwind of sex, drugs, and self-loathing.  She realizes that her dreams of Hollywood stardom are more about survival since she is miles away from home.  Her descent into the abyss of pornography and cocaine addiction are sanitized but still painfully depicted in this powerful film.  Her inhibitions about having sex on camera are lowered with every snort of cocaine, to numb her feelings of being degraded.

Pauleen tries to redeem herself with her family when she returns home to Kansas for visits, but finds herself rejected by her mother and one of her sisters because of her choices.  She wants to say hello to a former teacher of hers while Christmas shopping with her mom, but her mother is aware of the gossip around town about Pauleen's porn career.  This is a terrible blow to the naive, sensitive girl's self-esteem and it confirms her feelings of alienation.
Once she returns to LA, she develops a relationship with a much older man (John Pleshette) who sees something special in her.  To him, she isn't just a porn star...she is a vulnerable, sweet kid in need of love.

Unfortunately, her drug addiction increases and she continues her downward spiral.  The starry-eyed wonder she displays at the start is replaced with the bloody nose and dead eyes of a girl who has grown up much too fast, whose star has burned out too soon.  And on March 23, 1984 it all becomes too much for her to handle...she takes her own life at the tender age of twenty, haunted by regret and her own mental/emotional demons.

I've seen this movie and others like it many times and yet, it still makes me cry.  The real ""Pauleen"" was Colleen Applegate aka Shauna Grant (her adult-film pseudonym) and she was from Minnesota, not Kansas.
Her story is incredibly sad and the Frontline documentary ""Death of a Porn Queen"" underscores the tragedy of her short life.  It seems like she was a very sensitive, thoughtful girl with some deep-seated issues that no one can really talk about.  So, on the subject of ""Shattered Innocence"" here are my thoughts.

Pros...I love the music, the 80's hair and some of the glitzy outfits.  I like the fact that some of the characters are based on people she knew, like ""Nora"" was actually Laurie Smith, another porn actress/makeup artist who was a friend of hers.  I like the few tender moments she has with her mother when they aren't fighting and the scene where her father reads the poem is extremely moving; it adds a nice layer of depth.  And the minutes before her suicide, as well as the final scene?  It never fails to bring tears to my eyes!  The film does a great job in showing how low self-esteem can lead to destruction.

Cons...the lead actress, Jonna Lee, is excellent BUT she tends to overdo it a bit.  I enjoyed her passionate performance but at times it was almost too dramatic.  From what I've seen of the real Colleen Applegate in interviews, she was a very soft-spoken and shy young woman.  She seemed to have a maturity beyond her years despite whatever choices she made.  Jonna Lee in her portrayal of Colleen/Pauleen has her own moments of endearing charm but through much of the film she comes across as angry, petulant, stubborn and shrill.  Her portrayal is more like somebody with severe bipolar disorder (and I say this as a person who struggles with emotional stability).
My husband even said that her over-acting made him cringe.  I have no doubt that the real Colleen was indeed very troubled and maybe even difficult at times, but this movie made her seem like a bratty little girl for the most part.  I don't believe that is who she really was.

In conclusion, a tragic story similar to ""Star 80"" in some ways...small-town girl winds up in the seedy world of adult entertainment and winds up dead. It is the quintessential tale of a young woman's ambition ending in her demise. Pornography itself is not completely evil in my opinion, but ultimately one needs to be mentally/emotionally strong to survive such a lifestyle.  Colleen's sensitive soul couldn't survive the porn industry, nor could she deal with the social stigma that inevitably comes with certain choices.  She was still just a kid at 20 years old.  Although it was her decision to enter that world, her story inspires compassion for a young woman who lost her way in life.  She was somebody's daughter, sister, and friend.  There was another young woman from Minnesota who killed herself a few months ago after starring in a porn film and her story reminds me so much of Colleen, except that she had dark hair and was only 18. Her name was Alyssa Funke and like Colleen, she shot herself.

Hollywood and the sex industry often hold the lure of fame and fortune for millions of young girls, many of whom are unaware that there is a price to be paid. The lucky few will achieve stardom and be successful, while others will wind up hooked on drugs or HIV-positive or dead, like poor Colleen. A person in that industry, especially a woman, needs the wisdom and toughness to take care of herself because it is a business filled with corrupt people who will exploit those who are too trusting. It can be glamorous and exciting on the surface but young naive girls also should know that there is a dark side.
A truly sad true story...there is very little nudity or foul language and sex is only implied, so anyone looking for that should look elsewhere.",1414713600,14,7243,4.725536992840095

685078,3,6303491200,"A small-town girl with big-city dreams, 18-year-old Pauleen Anderson (Jonna Lee) arrives in Hollywood, where the blue-eyed blonde hopes to launch a high-paying modeling career.

Beginning with topless photos but soon making the move into hardcore porn, Pauleen becomes one of the biggest names in the business. But success has its price, as her struggles with guilt, drugs and her family's shame slowly drive the young woman toward the edge.

Inspired by true events and co-starring Melinda Dillon as Pauleen's disapproving mother and John Pleshette as her lover/would-be protector, Shattered Innocence pulls no punches in its depiction of a troubled girl's hard choices. With compelling performances and balanced direction by Sandor Stern, it compares favorably with similarly themed movies like Star 80 and Boogie Nights.",1395187200,,823,5.576

7850796,5,6303491200,"The first time I saw this movie I was 14. March, 09 1988. Immediately watching it I was drawn to the whole persona. I felt inside at that time I was going to have a connection to the whole story someday. But, inside my heart I knew it was a true story. Five years later I left my small town of 500 people and went to Los Angeles, CA. I could not believe I had arrived in L.A. But, it was real. Five years later I was in the Porn Industry. Making films and doing Cocaine. The year, 1998. Ten years after I had saw Shattered Innocence. I was 25. I was in the industry for 10 years and I made 37 films. I am now, 42. I left all that behind 8 yrs ago.

I now live a quiet peaceful life close to my family. I sometimes think that life comes full circle. This movie and the story of Colleen Applegate will always remain a part of my life. This is without a doubt, one of my favorite movies and stories ever told.

Jonna Lee was amazing in this role.

I give it an Excellent A...
