4327832,5,B004CLDB9A,"I purchased this DVD over the weekend and immediately tried it out.  Years ago I enjoyed Billy's Tae Bo DVD's, but have since been turned on by Tony Horton's P90 series and the way he uses weights to sculpt and have cardio intervals.  I will agree that this DVD doesn't do a lot of lunges or anything for legs, but if you really push yourself to do as Billy says and ""keep your butt down"" during the squat sections, your legs should burn.  The other reviews that say the legs aren't worked are just not really trying during the workouts.  I have rarely sweated this much during a workout.  Just be careful not to overdo it on the weights.  I started with 8 lbs thinking that since I train with weights it would be fine, but I switched to 5 lbs.  The movements start slow and get extremely fast like Tae Bo so if your weight is too heavy you reach muscle failure half way through, you start flinging your weights around, and you risk tearing muscles and injuring joints.

I am sore all the time and love this workout.  I can't get enough!!!  ""You gotts push yourself.  No one else is gonna push you so you gotta push yourself!"" -Billy Blanks",1304380800,12,1140,4.330188679245283
4327833,5,B004CLDB9A,This workout dvd is a great purchase for anyone. Trying to keep up with his 2010 releases I knew I had to buy it. After trying it out the 1st time I came away pushed to another level. It's a great change of pace from just cardiovascular training because of the added weight exercise. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Billy's workouts.,1303689600,,345,4.40625
4327834,1,B004CLDB9A,"I was a fan of Billy Blanks taebo workouts, so I was excited for this new DVD.  It was truly awful.  It is almost 90% focused on arms.  It barely has 'real' cardio.  The moves - with the weights - are WAY TOO FAST - for even very experienced exercisers.  I would absolutely NOT recommend this DVD to anyone.",1300320000,2,307,4.135593220338983
4327835,5,B004CLDB9A,"I ordered this DVD along with a few others (that hasn't been released) and this workout was awesome.  Most of it is done with free weights so you have the ability to use your own weight limit.  Many moves are the same but with a different twist.  It certainly got my heart rate up and my arms where sore the next day.  I will say the concentration is most upper body and core, there is little to no lower body routines on this dvd.  Overall, great workout.  Note that although the DVD run time states 63 mins, the actual workout is about 45 mins.",1297123200,28,546,4.201923076923077

Only ""complaint"" ,  the main workout portion (after warm up... Until cool down)  is only about half an hour.  A little short in my opinion",1436313600,,153,4.592592592592593

4327843,5,B004CLDB9A,"40 minutes of armwork with Billy ain't a joke! But I barely break a sweat with just this, I have to do another set of cardio to have a complete work out. But I sure do love showing off my guns. This will sculpt your arm muscles,  for sure!",1420329600,,239,3.877551020408163

4327845,5,B004CLDB9A,Don't forget to have your hand dandy 3 to 5 pound weights ready for workout. You will need them! Love this video,1414886400,,112,4.136363636363637
4327846,5,B004CLDB9A,I have a lot of billy blanks dvd. But this one is new favorite its has lots  of cardio and weights you will be dripping sweat.  I really work s your arms they burn.,1414368000,,164,3.7941176470588234
4327847,4,B004CLDB9A,this one is decent..gives a good workout for both cardio and muscular conditioning.,1408665600,,83,5.461538461538462
4327848,4,B004CLDB9A,"It is a moderate intensity exercise video and at the beginning, there is a segment where Tae-bo moves are demonstrated. If you are not used to Tae-bo, you might want to watch that. If you are a Tae-bo veteran, you can just dive straight in. The warm up gets you pumped up for the main workout. I have several other Billy Blanks' work out videos but I especially love this one because it is combined with hand weights. If your arms are your problem area, then you'll like this work out: your arms will BURN! I would have given this video a five star rating but I gave only 4 because it has very little of a cool down or stretch at the end. All in all, I loved it because I felt the burn and it made me sweat.",1406851200,5,707,4.057142857142857

4327850,5,B004CLDB9A,No silly dance moves that take several attempts to learn. This video is easy to follow but challenging for all fitness levels. Beginners may have to tone down some of the moves. Love the flexibility of mixing and matching different workouts. Its the new favorite!,1391990400,,263,4.866666666666666
4327851,5,B004CLDB9A,"""Sculpt"" is the perfect word for this work out.  Doing this a few times a week will definitely help sculpt your body and get you in shape",1383609600,,137,4.074074074074074
4327852,4,B004CLDB9A,"Gimmick free Billy with no bands or sticks.  All you need is a pair of dumbells, water bottle and towel.  This is the best of the Boot Camp series which mixes Tae Bo with strength training.  Other than some squats, a few kicks and holding horse stance there is not much in way of specific lower body training which is why I took one star off.  What you do get after the 5 minute warm -up is 40 minutes of intense upper body work all using the weight of your choice.  I started with 5 lbs then down to 3 and finally I was at 2 lbs at the end and could barely hold my arms up.  Like a lot of woman over 50 I have to constantly work at keeping my arms from getting jiggly and this is great for that since it is cardio combined with HIGH rep weight training which should help make lean muscles while burning the fat so my hard work is visable.  Will update after I do this with heart rate monitor.",1381708800,5,893,3.9831460674157304
4327853,3,B004CLDB9A,I bought this thinking that it would be a great at home workout video.  The moves are not easy to pick up and he moves very fast.  I guess that is how you get a better work out.  I think I need something for beginners and then to work my way up to this level.,1378080000,,259,3.672727272727273

4327857,5,B004CLDB9A,"This is one of my favorite DVD's and I love incorporating weights with the workout instead of bands, balls, and sticks that comes with some of the original DVD's and not some of the DVD only deals I find on Amazon. I do Tae Bo 4-5 times a week. This and the ""Fat Blasting Cardio"" are my absolute favorites. Its great for the arms!",1362441600,,330,4.171875
4327858,5,B004CLDB9A,I like the simplicity of the video. I was able to follow along and include Taebo into my daily workout routine. I highly recommend it for any one who is pressed for time.,1347580800,,170,4.181818181818182

I think it's more sculpting then cardio. But Billy combine cardio and sculpting.
I realy feel the burn. I did this workout many times and I see that something changed. I've got a sculpt body.
Great workout.
So five stars for Billy Blanks cardio sculpt.",1317427200,,440,4.653846153846154

When I finished i felt all my muscles, but they didn't hurt, that was my first concern. But to my surprise it did not happen.  Happy with my purchase.",1314921600,,259,4.14
4327863,2,B004CLDB9A,"Disappointing. I don't know how this man sweats as much as he does with such a low level of intensity! This does focus on arms, which is cool, because if you use light weights (I use 2 lb) it's good to sculpt and not build. To supplement, I will stop the dvd after each exercise and do 20-30 jack flies, 180 jumps, cross country skiing, or anything plyo. Also, he does many very slow reps, so instead of doing the slow version, I will just go right into the quick version. If you can do that, it's not so bad. If you are a beginner, this is a good dvd for you. Otherwise, you will definitely have to add some intensity on your own.",1311206400,,631,4.096774193548387

4327865,3,B004CLDB9A,Not an advanced workout. Mostly arms with some cardio.  Very little lower body and a few moves that didn't even make sense.  Probably a workout that will be done once a month.,1306195200,2,175,4.4375

8423215,4,B004CLDB9A,I love this boot camp video! I only wish you had the option of picking from 2 workouts or at least had a menu to skip over the initial demonstration to coach on proper form. If it weren't for that I would give it 5 stars,1479168000,,220,3.8043478260869565
