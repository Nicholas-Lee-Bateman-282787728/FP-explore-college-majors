8465403,5,B005CGID3I,"I love this series. A couple with 3 children is already "" outnumbered"" but when those 3 are as funny as these it is wonderful to watch. The children are adept at using their parents words against them.  This is like a real family with problems anf disasters but these things are somehow funnier with a British accent and a great script. Unbelievably the shows get funnier. The worries about a growing teen, dealing with bullying, cliques and school muggings!  Parental concern is pretty much ignored by the kids. Their logic is flawless and they twist the situations around so Mum and Dad are always in the wrong!
Great series at a good price, well packed and fast delivery. Can hardly wait for the next series and will certainly buy from this seller.",1357516800,2,751,4.639097744360902
8465404,5,B005CGID3I,"Outnumbered is a highly nominated comedy which started in 2007. Almost exclusively set inside the home of the Brockman family, where dad is a school teacher, and mom is an office manager, it centers around the everyday trials and tribulations of two parents who are literally ""outnumbered"" by their 3 young children. The show is semi-improvised, which makes for some fantastic comedic acts as Pete and Sue deal with their adolescent older son, Jake, brilliant but hyperactive and eccentric middle son, Ben, and easily influenced but and inquisitive daughter, Karen.
Occasional characters added to the mix are Ben's school teachers, Sue's self-centered sister, her father with dementia, and Pete's over-critical mother.
Any fan of British humor who has or has had children will appreciate the frustrations of trying to ""do the right thing"" with children, whilst having inconsistencies pointed out, and dealing with the constant ""but why?"" approach that children take.
Classic comedy with superb acting by all, that leads to fits of laughter.",1331856000,3,1040,5.347560975609756
