8184237,5,B000F6OALO,"I TOTALLY agree with Pastor Hagee that satanic forces are seducing kids with Harry Potter and those satanic cartoons they show on the Cartoon Network, and the likes.  It all comes under the guise of good, wholesome kiddie fun.  The cartoons of today frighten me, and I'm 45 years old!  It shocks me so much, and I was as rowdy & rebellious as any other teenager of my generation.  This world is brimming over with evil, and only Jesus can, and most certainly will, stop it!(just read the book of Revelation for proof)",1155859200,,517,4.526881720430108
