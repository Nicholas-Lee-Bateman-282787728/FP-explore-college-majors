8394526,5,B003CWEQ80,"This review is for the Blu-ray version. The quality of the video is superb. My wife and I enjoy this disc very much, Rudy's presentation is simple, useful (good tips) and it does not interfere with the landscapes. Highly Recommended.",1378944000,,233,4.85
8394527,4,B003CWEQ80,"The quality is superb. Colors are brilliant. You certainly get in the atmosphere.
One minor thing in my opinion. I thought all episodes where about Greece, but two are also about other European countries.
But as i said overall.......Wonderful and i guess the best thing on the market.",1371772800,,284,4.9375
8394528,5,B003CWEQ80,"This blu-ray+ set is excellent. It has Athens and Delphi on program one. Program two is the Greek Islands, which begins with my favorite island: Santorini, which in my opinion is the most interesting island in Greece. If you are interested in Santorini (aka Atlantis) check out the 1982 movie Summer Lovers starring Peter Gallagher and Daryl Hanna, which was filmed there by the director of The Blue Lagoon Randal Kleiser. Rudy makes a quick stop at Mykonos and Delos in the Cyclades group of islands.
Then he goes to Rome and Pompeii. Why? There is so much to see in Greece even if you only go to the islands and ignore the mainland. The Greek ferries are wonderful and in the summer can take you to all the islands for a reasonable price. When you get off the ferry, residents of the islands meet the ferry and invite you to stay at their home for a small price and take you there. During the winter the ferries don't run, so the Greeks are stuck on their island. When the young blonde girls from Sweden and Germany arrive on their island, the old Greek men bring a chair and a bottle of ouzo and watch them get off the ferry. In fact, everyone likes to watch the tourists hit the island. As a tourist I really enjoyed sitting in the sun on the ferry watching the young Greek girls in their black clothes.
Rudy could do a separate program for each island group: there are the Cyclades, the Home Islands (Poros and Hydra) and the islands off the Turkish coast, plus the large island of Crete where the film Zorba the Greek was filmed.  Instead of going to Rome, you can go to Turkey and see Greek cities there.",1362787200,2,1611,4.3879598662207355
8394529,3,B003CWEQ80,"I agree with another reviewer.  The first two discs on Greece are excellent. The third disc takes us through Europe showing Greece's influence, but the fourth disc leaves Greece entirely and focuses on the Italian countryside just outside Rome.  The Rudy Max series are wonderful, but I don't understand why he spent a quarter of his time in Italy in this series (I LOVE Italy by the way) when we are expecting a trip devoted to Greece.",1358208000,6,436,4.64935064935065
8394530,3,B003CWEQ80,"Scenic material was wonderful, would have liked to have seen more of the Coastal Scenery like that shown in the Movie Mama Mia, and Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. I think alot of Greece was bypassed in order to throw in other areas, other than Greece. I realize they were trying to show the Greek influences in other Countries, but they could have made a different DVD for that.",1347494400,4,383,4.565217391304348
8394531,5,B003CWEQ80,"Besides being educational, this video had some of the most gorgeous HD I'd ever seen. Rudy Maxa is a good host, too.  He's funny and smart, without ever getting patronizing or schticky.  Whether you want to learn about Greece or just soak in the high definition seascape awesomeness, I'd highly recommend this program.",1282780800,9,318,4.981132075471698
8394532,3,B003CWEQ80,"Travel films on Blu-ray are so hard to find that one is tempted to buy them all. Rudy Maxa does a nice job, but it it too bad that his photographer has marched through Europe without learning to properly set the aperture on their HD camera. After a week, with my own HD videocamera I can get more predictable results. One burned out, overexposed scene after another. They have also used an incredible amount of footage from the first two segments to produce the third and forth segments which appear to be mainly filler. Too bad blu-ray is waisted this way.

The other defect is hard to understand how they could have let slip out the door. If you start this disc (I have a Sony with the latest firmware), the menu never comes up by itself. I am sure they will get a lot of returns because if you don't hit the menu button on your remote, it will keep playing the introduction and nothing more.

Overall, a beautiful destination, but spoiled by sloppy camera work, editing and bad disc authoring.",1276387200,13,996,4.467032967032967
