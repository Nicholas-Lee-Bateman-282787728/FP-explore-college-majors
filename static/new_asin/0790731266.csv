88366,4,0790731266,"Most actors make 3 kinds of movies: bad, mediocre and good. Kevin Costner makes only 2 kinds: extraordinarily bad and good. Tin cup falls in the good category; it's the best he's made since Field of Dreams. We can give the  credit to Ron Shelton who co-wrote and directed with lively results.
I  give so much credit to Shelton that I wish he'd recorded a commentary  track; it'd be interesting to hear how he kept actor Costner while keeping  director Costner from tinkering.
Regardless of how it got done, what we  have is a well scripted, well photographed, interesting movie with an  excellent cast. Extra kudos to Don Johnson for his low-key villian; there  was no need for a supervillian in a movie about golf so Don just played it  smirky.
The DVD is a standard catalog title: good clean video and no real  extras.",951609600,2,820,4.6
88367,2,0790731266,I respect Kevin Costner alot as a Actor.his sports movies usually hit big time but this film is Long-Winded.after having his films not do so well at the box office it seems to me it's taken it's toll on him in this film.he  is trying to hard to be perfect.not one of his best but better than some of  his other choices in recent years.,950918400,3,335,4.138461538461539
88368,2,0790731266,"Tin cup is one of those films that meanders ever so slowly, considering it's centerd around the game of golf, one may find it quite quicker and maybe far more enjoyable to watch an actual entire 18 hole game itself.  Costner does he's standard by the book routine of romantic shmaltz (do I  sense some Meg Ryan typecasting going on here) and Rene Russo does little  else but try and swing a  golf club in those tight golf pants. Billed as a  romantic comedy one may find it difficult to find laughs amidst all the  yawns! . For serious lovers of the game or Costner himself, others may  find it far more entertaing finding a movie about love on the croquet set.",950918400,3,661,4.368852459016393
88369,4,0790731266,"Kevin Costner should stick to playing likeable average guys in films like 'Tin Cup'! Ron Shelton, who had worked with the actor earlier in one of the best baseball films ever made ('Bull Durham'), takes on the trials and  tribulations of a journeyman professional golfer in this outing, and while  it lacks the charm and comraderie of the earlier film, it manages to make  the solitary nature of golf more human and acceptable to all the  non-golfers out here.
It is not the best golf film ever made (that honor  goes to the Randy Quaid comedy, 'Dead Solid Perfect'), and it does have  flaws (the leisurely pacing, some overlong scenes), but there is such a  warm, fuzzy feeling to the entire film that you end up rooting for Costner,  both on the golf course, and in his pursuit of Rene Russo (who is  wonderful!)
Cheech Marin provides welcome comedy relief, and Don  Johnson's slick smarminess is a perfect counterpoint to Costner's gonzo  approach to golf and life.
Costner's laid-back charm, perhaps his  greatest asset as an actor, is often lost in sci-fi epics like  'Waterworld', and 'The Postman', or tearjerkers like 'Message in a Bottle'.  Sports films are a far better venue for him ('Bull Durham' and 'Field of  Dreams' are cases in point), and he is relaxed and confident in 'Tin Cup',  making this one of his best performances.
Buy it! You won't be  disappointed!",949881600,37,1377,4.766949152542373
88370,4,0790731266,"Kevin Costner is one of the most athletic actors in film history. Not many others could have made Crash Davis believable in Bull Durham. In this movie, Costner shows his athletic ability again, playing a round of golf  with a variety of gardening tools and swtich-hitting his drives.
Costner  also shows another side of his talent - his title role is a not-too-bright  loser. This is a big departure from his epic heros in Waterworld and The  Postman. As you might suspect, he's a better loser than he is a hero.
One  other thing about the golf in this movie - while some of it is pretty out  there (does ESPN really televise pro-am's from podunk towns in West  Texas?), there's nothing really unstable. No PA guys doing play-by-play or  generic white uniforms or anything like that. The scene on the driving  range before the US Open is a classic!
The rest of the cast is solid, and  Cheech Marin nearly steals the movie (as he often does). The plot does hold  one big surprise (the end isn't what you think it's going to be), but is  fairly predictable otherwise. The soundtrack is great, the West Texas and  North Carolina scenery is great, and there's more than a few laughs.
Pick it up and enjoy!",948240000,14,1201,4.530232558139535
88371,1,0790731266,"This movie promised to be ""one of the best comedies of the nineties""...is that the 1890's?  There was not one funny moment in this hastily put together inside look at golf, and the audience is supposed  to fall in love with Costner's role long after he has put us to sleep.  Sorry...just a ripoff of the much better golf classic ""Dead Solid  Perfect"" with Randy Quaid, and a feeble attempt at humor which ended  up in stupidity and boredom.",947116800,7,440,4.518987341772152

88424,2,0790731266,"Review of Tin Cup
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

Well, if you're a golf fanand by that, I mean you like watching bad movies that have a golf settingyoull be able to get through this one without boredom setting in. For the rest of you, skip this one and pick another Kevin Costner sports movie.

Kevin Costner and sportsa combination weve happily watched three times before Tin Cup and three times after. This one, where Costner plays a has-been golfer who gets back in the game to get, uh, love, just doesnt cut the mustard. Who would have thought? The star is a good-looking guy, the love interest is as pretty as Hollywood can make her, and the promotional poster is really cute (and incidentally doesnt even hint at the movie having anything to do with golf). Somewhere along the line, it falls flat. Probably around the time when Costner shows Rene Russo how to golf and does the whole Ill stand behind you and show you how to hold the stick routine.

If you like cheesy, kind-of-lousy romantic comedies, go out and rent it. Its not atrocious. Youll live. But if you're in the mood for a better movie (and just as much Kevin Costner yumminess) you're better off watching Bull Durham.",1497744000,,1187,4.537383177570093

88632,5,0790731266,"For anybody who loves golf movies this is a great movie to watch.  Matt Damon, Will Smith and Charleze Thrion are wonderful counterparts to him as are all of the supporting cast.  The story is a remarkably deep metaphor that describes the untapped potential in each one of us.  We all have, ""That Perfect Swing"" that we were born with and that we must find in order to make the most out of our lives, no matter what kind of life we have.  This is a universal human truth and in a sense this is a movie that speaks to the untapped potential within all of us.

In life the question is not whether we win the game, but the way that we play that game.  All of the great religions and ideologies say the same thing.  Life is not a matter of winning or loosing but of being the person that one's values dictate that they should be.  Either God or History is the final Judge of the way that things work out and whether we win in financial or personal terms is less important than whether we stand for the values that we believe in.

So ultimately Tin Cup is not about winning golf matches at all.  Dr. Griswod, surveying the entire retinue of people sleeping in Roy Mackevoy's  Winnebego says, ""This is the way it should be and the way that it is always going to be. We will not settle down.  We will spend the rest of our lives on the Golf Tour.  I've picked up many client golf pros anyway, so I can make a living on the Golf Tour.  Just Go For It"".",1447113600,,1444,4.129032258064516

88638,5,0790731266,"This was a sweet movie and nice to see Costner in this role. He has really played the gamut. I like his more recent works in his older years, like ""Three Days to Kill"".  It's nice to see a Costner that is not just another fancy pants looker, but when he's aged more and better for the wear. Even in  latter years, he still knows how to fill out a suit and look AMAZING. Plus, I always like Russo in about anything she plays.",1444608000,,424,4.035714285714286

88707,5,0790731266,"I came late to this movie, watching it for the first time just a month ago.  However, I've played golf for 52 years, starting with my Dad when I was 7, and I see the character of Roy McAvoy as an everyman figure for everyone who's ever played and game and wanted to make ""the shot.""

HBecause that's Roy's great tragic failing:  he knows he can make The Shot, and he refuses to back down from attempting it.  His best friend and lifelong caddy Romeo Posar (Cheech Marin), puts it to him bluntly and frequently:  ""Par can win.""  Roy, however, sees every lie as a personal affront and something to be attacked and defeated.  This attitude cost him a pro career as a young college-age prodigy, while his best friend/rival David Simms (Don Johnson) was willing to settle for par and not attempt The Shot, and now has a decent career on the pro circuit.

The film starts with Roy giving a golf lesson to therapist Dr. Molly Giswold (Renee Russo) at his run-down driving range.  His beer-drinking buddies at the range judge her harshly:  ""Such a pretty girl, and such an ugly swing.""  Roy offers her a philosophic view of golf, similar to his soliloquy on baseball in ""Bull Durham,"" but in the end he advises her to to just ""Grip it and rip it.""

Roy immediately grasps that she's taking lessons because of her boyfriend, and discovers that the boyfriend is his old college friend David Simms when David shows up at Roy's range and offers Roy what he thinks is an opportunity to play in David's local Pro-Am tournament.  Roy at first is excited to get back into golf at this level, but then is outraged to find out that David wants him as his caddy. ""I can't take some guy off the street for this tournament,"" David says, emphasizing that he's trying to build a legacy and wants only recognized golfers to participate.

Roy refuses at first, but Romeo convinces his to take the job because David offers $100 plus 5% of any winnings.  But once again, Roy's stubbornness causes his downfall when David refuses The Shot in his tournament to play it safe, and a contemptuous Roy makes a bet that he can make the shot with his 7-iron.  (Roy's 7-iron figures very large in this film.)  David tells Roy that if he tries the shot he'll fire him, but Roy does it anyway -- successfully -- and David fires him on the spot and refuses to pay him anything.

Molly continues to come to Roy for lessons, however, and Roy realizes that he's fallen for her.  A funny scene where he goes to her for therapy and confesses his love for her TO her, and her subsequent confusion about how to deal with it, leads to him offering to try to enter the U.S. Open (a major tournament open to anyone with a handicap 3 or above who can qualify at a local tournament) to prove his seriousness.

Golf hijinks ensue.  As ""Caddyshack"" was to golf over-the-top-comedy, ""Tin Cup"" is to golf could-really-happen comedy.  Don Johnson is excellent as Kevin Costner's former friend and now rival, disdaining Costner's failings while recognizing his true talent.  You never get a feeling of dislike between the pair; more a feeling of you-could-have-been-great-now-look-at-you from Johnson and I'll-prove-you-wrong-yet from Costner.

There's lots of cameos from real golf pros, and a side story involving Cheech and the owner of a ""gentleman's club"" who owns the title to Roy's driving range, and enough real golf going on to keep everything moving along.  I highly recommend this for an evening's entertainment.",1433980800,,3466,4.651888341543514

88917,3,0790731266,"OVERVIEW:  Co-written and directed by Ron Shelton, the 1996 romantic comedy ""Tin Cup"" takes its place as a humorous and well-acted underdog story about a former golf prodigy, Roy McAvoy, who never lived up to his potential.  Once McAvoy finally finds his motivation (be it a woman or just a chance to one-up the other guy), he does whatever it takes to qualify for the U.S. Open and prove his worth in the world of golf.

The first time I saw ""Tin Cup,"" it was being broadcasted on basic cable.  As I watched, I couldn't believe how funny it was and that I'd never before heard of the movie.  I quickly went online to purchase the DVD for home viewing.  On a personal level, I get a little tired of the motivational sports movies that take themselves too seriously--for this reason, ""Tin Cup"" is among my favorites for the genre.  Rotten Tomatoes gives ""Tin Cup"" a 69% rating on the tomato-meter, which is higher than I had anticipated, yet seems to signify a respectable fan-base for the film.

STARRING ROLES include:  Kevin Costner as Roy ""Tin Cup"" McAvoy, Don Johnson as David Simms, Rene Russo as Dr. Molly Griswold, Cheech Marin as Romeo Posar, Linda Hart as Doreen, Rex Linn as Dewey, Lou Myers as Clint, Dennis Burkley as Earl, and George Perez as Jose.

""Tin Cup"" also features its weight in cameos from TV golf commentators Jim Nantz, Frank Chirkinian, and Ken Venturi as well as from professional golfers Phil Mickelson, Craig Stadler, Gary McCord, Corey Pavin, Johnny Miller, Lee Janzen, Billy Mayfair, and Fred Couples.

SUMMARY:  As a young lad, the world of golf had high expectations for Roy ""Tin Cup"" McAvoy, but Roy seems just fine and dandy living the simple life in West Texas.  When he's not drinking with his buddy Romeo, Roy runs a driving range (though he usually does both simultaneously).  Psychologist Molly Griswold, perhaps inspired by her professional golfer boyfriend, David Simms, enlists Roy's services for golf lessons.

Roy initially believes Simms is offering him a spot to play in an upcoming tournament, but Simms actually wants Roy to caddy.  Despite the blow to his ego, Roy agrees to lend his expertise of the course.  Amid play, Roy and Simms engage in an argument about the best strategy for a particular hole; Roy insists on shooting for the green while David prefers to air on the side of caution, thus avoiding the water hazard.  As the men pump their fists, the peanut gallery takes bets on the men.  Against Simms' wishes, Roy breaks caddy-ship and takes the 230-yard shot, landing his ball on the green.

Weighed by Simms's insults, Roy seeks revenge by beating him in the U.S. Open.  In order to qualify, Roy knows he has to overcome a few personal issues--the kind for which Molly agrees to help.  Roy's recklessness on the course digs him into an even deeper hole.  In the meantime, Molly gains a new perspective of her high-and-mighty boyfriend, which seems to drive her and David further apart, but she and Roy closer together.",1382832000,2,2981,4.734496124031008

Seeking advice, Costner's character meets with a know sport psychologist(Russo)who later falls in love with her. This movie is very funny as well as exciting.

88952,4,0790731266,"In the 1996 film ""Tin Cup,"" Roy McAvoy (Kevin Costner) is the owner of a driving range in rural West Texas.  Once seemingly destined for stardom on the PGA Tour, Roy is stuck in a directionless life and trapped in obscurity.  When Molly Griswold (Renee Russo), a psychologist, shows up for golf lessons, Roy becomes smitten but learns that she is involved with an old college teammate of his, tour pro David Simms (Don Johnson).

Roy and David have a falling out during a charity tournament, leading Roy to attempt to qualify for and win the U.S. Open.  He must conquer old demons that kept him from reaching his potential in the past--he relies on Molly for advice on the mental side of his golf game, but marches to his own drummer and does not rely on the sound advice of his caddy, Romeo Posar (Cheech Marin), on course management when they are inside the ropes.  Along the way, he finds that he wants to win not just the Open but Molly as well.

""Tin Cup"" is a generally enjoyable movie and would likely be found so by both sexes, as it is both sports flick and romantic comedy, and the four main cast members are all great in their roles.  Cameo appearances are made by PGA Tour stars of the mid-Nineties such as Phil Mickelson and Lee Janzen, and Jim Nantz plays himself as a broadcaster.

88959,5,0790731266,"This is the best romantic comedy ever filmed. Costner possesses what no other Hollywood lead (except Katharine Hepburn) ever possessed: a multifaceted athletic ability, and that makes his sports-based movies with Ron Shelton completely believable. The chemistry between all of the actors is palpable. There is, of course, instant romance between Russo and Costner, who seem destined to become soul mates. But beyond that, the male bonding between all of the key players is presented with touching finesse, to which the secondary players serve as a Greek chorus. This masterpiece of the genre feels like a film of more innocent times--before 911. Everything about it, including the musical score, transports the viewer to a world we probably never quite achieved but that we aspired to. Shelton loves to show a funny situation while the actors are speaking of something unrelated and serious. By doing so, he layers up meaning and feeling to where it simulates, with marvelous humor, the richness and complexity of actual life.

This is a beautiful and charming work of art. If you watch it once, you'll watch it again and again. All movies should be this delightful and engrossing. Very few of them are.",1362787200,,1203,5.075757575757576

88990,5,0790731266,"Last night I wanted to watch something funny so I put ""Tin Cup"" on the DVD. I was skeptical. I've never really liked nor understand golf as an adult game and I've only golfed once, and that was over 50 years ago. How could golf be funny? Well, it was! This movie is just hilarious in a relaxed and low-key way! It's very fun to view and I'll end up watching it several more times in the future. Trust me.

Kevin Costner was the star with Rene Russo in the female lead. Don Johnson played a rival golfer and Cheech Marin played Costner's caddy. All were excellent and the movie was well directed by Ron Shelton. Costner played a somewhat nehr-do-well driving range golf pro from small-town West Texas who scratched out a living by giving lessons and challenging other golfers into making foolish bets. In one bet, he used a baseball bat, an army-surplus shovel and a garden rake as his golf tools and beat a fellow golfer who owned a set of high-quality golf clubs. This was one you just have to see. It's very funny! There were others as well. Always screwing around, Costner was a very  talented golfer who never managed to amount to anything until he met and fell in love with Russo, a psychologist and a leading golf-pro's girl friend. Costner taught her golf and she helped him with the mental aspects of the game. Ultimately, he came in first in the U. S. Open, ahead of her then ex-boyfriend. It's a touching story.

This was a funny movie. What else can I say? I was chuckling throughout. It's a relaxing and easy-going story and it just ambles along at an easy pace. If you like golf, I'd guess you'd love it. If you don't like golf, well you might like it just as much. It's that kind of movie. Something for everybody.

The plot was weak and meandering.  There's more I didn't like in the movie than parts that I did.  For me, Kevin Costner's character was sleezy and not that likeable.

89059,4,0790731266,"With golf being as fun and popular as it is,it is great to see movies about golf being made. ""Tin Cup"" is a great addition to golf movies,and while it may not be ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Caddyshack"",has a great plot and script that will keep its viewers entertained until the very end...

This movie begins with going into the life of Roy McAvoy (Kevin Costner). While Roy may be a talented golfer with a lot of good friends,there is one problem that lies within Roy. The problem? When Roy gets angry,Roy gets destructive. And,when Roy gets destructive,not only does he cause harm for himself,he causes harm for other people,at the same time--two things that have taken a negative effect on Roy's life.

But then,one day,things change. This is when Roy meets a shrink named Dr. Molly Griswold(Rene Russo),who is a nice person that is not only smart when it comes to the issue of golf,but who also ends up(unexpectdly and unplanned)winning the heart of Roy. For Roy,this seems like a great opportunity to find real and true love and to reform himself....yet here,Roy finds another problem. This problem:the fact that not only does Molly have a boyfriend,but the fact that her boyfriend is a man named David Simms(Don Johnson),another golfer who happens to be the archnemises of Roy McAvoy(for good reasons,I might add). From here,can Roy not only win the U.S. open,but be able to bring Molly over from being David's girlfriend to being his girlfriend? Only time will tell!!!

When it comes down to ""Tin Cup"",this film has a lot of high points going for it. Not only is the plot for this film both interesting and creative with a strong and well-paced script accompanying it,which helps bring this movie to life,the acting here is very strong as well. While Kevin Costner's performance of Roy McAvoy in this film may not be one of Costner's best performances (compared to Costner's performances in a lot of his other films,which include ""JFK"",""Dragonfly"",""The Guardian"",etc.),through his performance,Costner does an excellent job at bringing a lot of humor and drama into his performance as Roy McAvoy,which helps this film shape itself. Don Johnson,while he may not be one of America's finest actors,brings the personality of Sonny Crockett onscreen here (with a lot of originality,at the same time)with his perfomance of David Simms. At the same time,Rene Russo does a perfect job at allowing this movie to have chemistry:on its own,for her own character,and between Kevin Costner's performance of Roy McAvoy and Don Johnson's performance of David Simms. These elements here not only keep this film moving along in an intelligent manner,help bring the movie to life and allow this film's viewers to get to know who the characters of Roy,David,and Molly are as people. How can you go wrong there??!!!

As already mentioned by another reviewer,the ending for this film is a bit weird (while,at the same time,some of this film's script does come out too be rather odd for its plot,especially when taking look at other movies that are not only similiar to this film,but are of this film's own genre,as well). But,on top of all of that,with this film's script doing what every film script needs to do(be good and interesting,and take it's time at getting to the main points of the film)and providing a good and worthwhile script here,how can you go wrong with this film? With this film's positive elements,it becomes not only a good golf movie,but a good movie,on it's own.

Special feautures here include profiles for the main actors in this film (Kevin Costner,Rene Russo,Don Johnson,Cheech Marin,as well as director Ron Shelton),and a biography for this film (would have preferred to see a behind-the-scenes look into the making of this film,but with the biography of the film that is provided here having good information that gives one the kind of information about this film that a behind-the-scenes look would,I am not complaining).

Overall,an entertaining and enjoyable film with not only a good plot and scipt,but good acting,accompanied by a good cast of actors and a good director. Worth viewing for not only fans of golf,but all movie fans,in general.",1172275200,4,4154,5.004341534008683

And Costner was -- well, he was Costner, which means he was okay but sort of, I don't know, sort of dull or bland or something. I've never figured out why he became such a star.
The movie had some amusing moments and was reasonably entertaining, but it seems to me there were a lot of golf in-jokes. I got them because I'm a golfer. I don't know about non-golfing viewers.
Finally, I am frankly baffled by people's reaction to the big scene on the 72nd hole. Lots of people, including golfers, have told me they love that scene. I just don't get it. Holing out for a 12 because you're a bone-head who refuses to lay up and win the U.S. Open is not cute or eccentric. It's just dumb. And if it happened in real life, the crowd would not cheer wildly. (For what it's worth, PGA pro Peter Jacobsen -- who appeared as himself in the movie -- more or less agrees with my criticism of this scene in his book ""Embedded Balls"").",1109376000,3,1045,4.336734693877551

I guess Costner's character was loaded with determination. A minor plus I guess.

Another highlight was when Roy MacAvoy chipped a shot out of the bar accross a runaway and forced a Pelican to leave its perch. Cheap amusement but certainly amusing.

Russo is her flakey,sweet,adorable self.  Costner is a natural for this down-and-out fellow drinking beer and betting on which bug will be zapped next.  His friends are just plain ole Texas boys.  Cheech Marin ,as Romeo Posnar, is a scene stealer.  Great role and nice to see him again.
Some silly dialogue.  The ""Pancake House"" scene is hysterical.  Some nice, mature friendship develoment between Marin, Hart (who ROCKS!!) as Doreen, all in relation to Costner's ""Tin Cup"" character.

89087,5,0790731266,"I am not a golfer and I very seldom watch golf on TV (usually happens when I'm at someone else's house who is watching a match). To me it's like watching grass grow... yet two movies on my favorite's list are ""Tin Cup"" and ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"". Golf may be the background for both of these films, but the real story is the characters that develop before your very eyes. Characters worth watching.

Roy ""Tin Cup"" McAvoy is a lovable character who appears to have very little prospects of ever achieving success... of any kind. His philosophy is simple, there are challenging moments in life, face the challenge and define the moment or it defines you. Romeo Posar (Cheech Marin) is his closest confident, his business partner, and his best friend. Together, they run a ramshackle driving range marked with a sign, ""the last chance to hit golf balls fore the next 520 miles"", on the outskirts of Salome, a small Texas border town. Tin Cup, a down and out former college golfer who had exhibited talent and promise, gives golf lessons and Romeo maintains the equipment.
From the opening scene, the musical score ties directly into the saga and the character development becomes more obvious as the storyline progresses. The comedy begins to unfold early on when a beautiful psychologist, Dr. Molly Griswold (Rene Russo), shows up seeking a golf lesson. You have to SEE this to appreciate it. Roy is unknowingly smitten by Molly, unfortunately we soon learn she is involved.
David Simms (Don Johnson), a pro golfer and Tin Cup's former college partner, shows up with an offer to get Roy back on the golf course. Simm's, running his annual charity match on a local area course, want's to win. So he's seeking Roy's familiarity with the course to boost his chances. He wants Roy on his team... as a CADDY for him! Much to Romeo's chagrin, Roy accepts the offer of 5% of the purse. In the interim Roy learns that Molly is Simm's girlfriend, and he also begins to acknowledge his feelings for her.

From this point on, the character's develop to show that Simm's is a self-serving phony that always plays it safe. Molly has a history of failed relationship's with guys who have never lived up to her expectations. Roy is a guy who willingly accepts the risks in life because that's who he is! As such, he often triumphs in the face of adversity, and finds a level of success even in failure. Romeo has an interesting cure for the ""shanks""! He is also true to his namesake, and though Roy and he have some ups and downs, he is a faithful friend to the end.
There are ""defining moments"" throughout this tale, there are even defining moments at the 19th Hole worth watching!! During the ""US Open"", we non-chalantly learn the defining moment that led to Roy's ""Tin Cup"" handle. And then of ""course"", let's not forget the actual golf match moments. Lastly, there are a host of other interesting characters to watch as well.

In summary, I have to admit that because of the way it helped define these characters, I actually enjoyed the parts where I was watching the grass grow! We exit as we entered... and the sound track is true to the end. SO! If you enjoy comedy, romance, triumph, and REAL characters, and you haven't seen this film, spend a few bucks and treat yourself!",1050278400,4,3271,4.626506024096385

Kevin and Don's characters were also supposed to be from the University of Houston.
That being said, I think Kevin did a wonderful acting job. His character was completely believable. It was also interesting to see Cheech and Don being on opposite sides after watching them together in their TV show, Nash Bridges. And of course, Rene looked great.",1014336000,,703,4.415384615384616
89090,3,0790731266,"The first movie about this loveable doofus of a golf pro named Roy McAvoy (Kevin Costner) who is burnt out and running a driving range in Nowheresville.  Roy is just enough of an anti-hero to make you uncomfortable rooting for him, but when a stunning Rene Russo shows up for lessons while dating a PGA pro (a perfectly cast Don Johnson), you start to pull for our hero who lives in a trailer and, apparently, does not own a hair brush.
When the ""Is he going to get the girl?"" question is answered, we suddenly leave the armpit of a driving range and find ourselves at the green, lush US Open, an event Roy has qualified for to show Russo he's got what it takes.  Thus begins our second movie, a golf movie... lots of golf swings, lots of grass, fairly entertaining if you know what a shank is.  Even if you don't, the question of whether will ruin his shot at the Open like he's ruined the rest of his life is still outstanding and, I believe, answered in an unconventional and entertaining manner.
I'm choosey about the DVDs I purchase because I'm fairly certain that in five years another more groovy video format will show up and I don't want to end up with 500+ CDs like I did in the 90s.

89104,3,0790731266,"Having admired Ron Shelton's ""Bull Durham"" and ""White Men Can't Jump,"" I was fully prepared to like this film, and I did to a point...Kevin Costner seems to have been born to star in sports movies, and, yes, he does seem to stumble when he goes to far afield, or from the field...or from the green.  On the other hand, you could also say that he's almost too comfortable in a vehicle like this.  Is it really just a choice between light sports-themed fare and portentous,overlong sci-fi epics?
It may be that golf is, well, golf.  You're either passionate about it or you're not.  Non-baseball fans in this country are still imbued with baseball culture.  Other Costner films like the aforementioned ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"" play to popular American myth, one that even non-sports fans can readily grasp.  But golf appeals, in the main, to other golfers.  And, I don't care what its devotees may say, it's never as much fun to watch in real life or in the movies as it is to play.
Others have complained about the film's pacing.  It may be a little obvious to link that problem to the golf theme, but I think it's still a valid critique.  Yes, Rene Russo once again proves herself to be a deft comic actress, and Cheech Marin is just right as Costner's sidekick.  But it is all a little familiar.  In the final analysis, ""Tin Cup"" is a film worth seeing, but as a purchase, it remains optional--for all but the most devoted Shelton or Costner fans.",978566400,2,1459,4.530534351145038

89108,4,0790731266,"""Tin Cup"" is a light-hearted story of a talented, but quirky golf pro, Roy  McAvoy (Kevin Costner as more of a ""never-quite-been"" than a ""has-been"")  that owns a run-down driving range in the middle Texas desert country.  There is, of course, the obligatory assortment of odd-ball characters that  are employed at the driving range, but this actually works to the movie's  benefit.  Cheech Marin plays Costner's long-time friend and caddy, and his  performance is a major highlight of this movie.  Don Johnson is superb as  the cool, calculating touring pro with an engaging smile and a heart of  steel.  Rene Russo is also on hand as a rather flakey pyschologist, who  just happens to be Johnson's girlfriend.
While I can't put this film in  the big belly-laugh catagory, it is cute, warm-hearted, and has several  rather funny scenes.  Although I wondered why it took 2 hours and 15  minutes to tell such a simple story, I really only found it boring when the  movie strayed unnecessarily to McAvoy's problems with his ex-wife (an  exotic dancer, no less).
Those minor problems aside, I enjoyed the fact  that the ending differed slightly from the standard run-of-the-mill ""old  pro makes good"" scenerio.  I also enjoyed the appearances of the real golf  pros and announcers (some of the movies best moments are on the golf course  and with the banter of the announcers and tv producers behind the  scenes).
