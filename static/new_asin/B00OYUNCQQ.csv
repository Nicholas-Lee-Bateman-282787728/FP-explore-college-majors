8685572,5,B00OYUNCQQ,I have always felt that he was given a rough time by the media and by elements within the Church. I had the fortune to have been trained by the loyal Professor Johannes Visser who was the leader of the loyal minority report for Humanae Vitae.

8685575,4,B00OYUNCQQ,"The legacy of Pope(Blessed) Paul VI was one of great controversy and evokes mixed feelings even almost forty years after his reign. Who was this man? What was his vision and goals for the Catholic Church? Why was he loved, despised or treated with indifference or outright contempt? This film tries to lay to rest the controversies surrounding this pope and to exonerate him of all the 'misdeeds' attributed to him and his time as Pontiff.

The documentary begins with his early life and gives us a look into his family, upbringing, seminary days, when he worked for the Vatican corps, his tenure as Archbishop of Milan and finally his reign as Pope. Narrated in English with actual photographs and film footage, this documentary very successfully brings to the forefront the tumultuous times of the the two World Wars and the subsequent social, cultural, spiritual and political upheavals of the 1960's. One does begin to feel sympathy for this pope who had to man the barque of the Church during this difficult period in the world's and the church's history. the effects of which are still felt and seen today. We can also hear the Pope for ourselves as several of his speeches are shown in this documentary.

Having covered the pros, and now turning to the cons, this documentary fails in giving details to the events which caused Paul VI to decide in a certain way and why he was subsequently misunderstood. It seemed that this was just simply a 'touch and go'. Since it is said that 'the devil is in the detail' it would've really helped had further elaboration been given. This documentary tries very hard to convince the viewer of his sanctity without wanting to 'stoke the flames' of debate or controversy. Will it help dispel the judgements pronounced on Paul VI? That depends solely on the disposition of the viewer.
However it is worth a buy for its historical content and for getting to know the spirit of a man who once was the 262nd Successor of St. Peter.

This DVD has a dual language track in English and Spanish with certain parts of Pope Paul VI's speeches in Italian and French (where the viewer is provided with Emglish/Spanish subtiles depending on language track), and is 55 minutes long. There are no scene selection nor special features on this disc.
