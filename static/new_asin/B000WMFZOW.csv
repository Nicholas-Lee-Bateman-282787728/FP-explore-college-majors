2985789,4,B000WMFZOW,"I found this DVD to be very informative.  Interview by his high school friend, George Klein.  I have read a lot of books about Elvis but this DVD has facts about his generosity that I did not know.  I recommed it for an Elvis collector or anyone who is curious about his many charitable donations and personal donations to friends.  It brought tears to my eyes.  This was a very generous, kind man who always wanted to share his wealth.",1202774400,8,436,4.4
2985790,3,B000WMFZOW,"Most of the content in this DVD appears in other Elvis-related materials. However, I like the focus on Elvis' generosity. As a primer for someone who doesn't know this side of Elvis, it is pretty good. Long live his blessed memory in any way, shape or form!",1202601600,3,257,4.48936170212766
2985791,4,B000WMFZOW,IT SUMS UP ELVIS EMENCE GENEROUSERTY AND HIS ONE OF A KIND SENCE OF BEING.,1200355200,2,74,4.0
2985792,2,B000WMFZOW,I also bought this DVD at Wal-Mart. The interviews were great and I found out a lot of information I did not know about Elvis. It is wonderful hearing of all the great and generous things Elvis did. I also was glad to hear of the on going generosity by Lisa Marie and Priscilla. The reason for my low rating is the picture quality of the photos and film footage used is horrible. I also expected to hear Elvis songs in the background-instead they used some off the wall music.,1199923200,3,476,4.3
2985793,3,B000WMFZOW,"This is a fairly good documentary on
Elvis. Some of the folks talk too
much but overall it is a good
DVD to have if you are an Elvis
fan. I was at Graceland on opening
day (a long time ago) and I heard
stories over and over about how
good and kind he was.",1199664000,3,255,3.6545454545454548
2985794,4,B000WMFZOW,"Bought this at Wal-Mart.  I loved the totally new interviews with close friends of Elvis, like Lowell Hays and Johnny Phillips and George Klein.  I had always heard about how kind and generous Elvis was and this was so cool hearing about his good deeds from those very, very close to him.  I'm sick of hearing the bad news about Elvis.  This DVD was a refreshing take on the ""real"" Elvis.  I recommend this DVD to any and all Elvis fans or those to want to learn more about this kind, talented and loving man.",1196208000,17,509,4.315789473684211

REALLY, A MUST BUY.....",1196121600,20,348,4.369230769230769
2985796,5,B000WMFZOW,"This is, without question, one of the best films ever done about the King. It's totally different than anything ever done on him. It really shows, in a warm, moving way, the great generosity and kindness Elvis exhibited throughout his life. The interviews with Elvis' good friend, George Klein, and the interviews with Elvis' jeweler, Lowell Hays are so moving and interesting. Every Elvis fan NEEDS to own this DVD.",1196121600,14,416,4.957142857142857
2985797,5,B000WMFZOW,"Wow!  This really is great.  I'm a big Elvis fan, and I'm so glad to see someone show the positive side of Elvis.  The interview with Lowell Hays is really interesting to hear all those stories.  I always like to hear George Kline tell his stories.  I like this DVD a lot.  Very positive and uplifting.  I'm so glad to see that the DVD also shows all of the good things being done in the name of the King even today.  This is a must have for my collection.",1195430400,24,456,4.044943820224719

2985930,5,B000WMFZOW,"I learned very interesting information about a man who few people (unless they were close to him) could even comprehend.  Elvis was generous (some thought, to a fault) to his family, friends and even people he didn't know well.  Very worth your money to purchase and time to read about this amazing man.",1363564800,2,303,4.69811320754717
2985931,5,B000WMFZOW,"This was a wonderful DVD.  We love anything to do with Elvis and this takes the best of his life.  It displays his wonderful generosity and how deeply he loved the people, not only those who surrounded him, but also the stranger who passed his way.  He never ignored or disregarded any need that he was made aware of.  Because he never forgot who helped him get to where he was in life.  It was the people who loved him, those who bought the tickets to his shows, his movies, who bought his records and CDs.  These were the ones who fulfilled his dreams and gave them wings.  They crowned him King of Rock and Roll.  He never forgot that... and he loved them for it.

I just wish I could find Volume 1.  If there's a volume 2, there has to be a volume 1 somewhere.",1353974400,3,764,4.136054421768708
