8407536,2,B003WUYGF0,For 20 minutes you get to watch a self loving Kevin Pollack describe his lack of internet knowledge and guzzle water and talk about himself on and on.... then Jim finally arrives on the show and we still get Kevin talking about himself. It is worth it if you can buy  it cheap as I did from another disgruntled owner.  With Jim Gaffigan there are always gems!  The video quality is worse than an old VHS ... extremely low bit rate..... total amateur hour.,1413331200,,455,4.392857142857143
8407537,5,B003WUYGF0,"This is a neat dvd of Kevin's very informal talk show. I have always thought Felicia Day was great and this hour plus interview with her proves it. You can get a lot of info about who she is as a person, but also some real insight into the whole webseries thing, which is growing as an alternative to tv. If I wanted to do a web series I would buy this because Felicia gives you the full deal. If you're not into that or gaming, it's just nice to watch her, she is so down to earth.",1389225600,,482,3.9285714285714284
8407538,1,B003WUYGF0,Kevin Pollaks Chat Show /  I was expecting something entertaining. But all I got was talk talk talk. Nothing funny just talk. Sorry Kevin but just listening to you talk is not what I what want from you.,1385510400,,202,4.315789473684211
8407539,5,B003WUYGF0,clearly two veterans of the stand-up / acting biz. Both are at their top of their game..This video will keep all very entertained as thier are some very funny/ interesting stories.well worth the investment.highly recommend..,1323820800,,224,5.428571428571429
8407540,1,B003WUYGF0,okay...sounds like a great interview but watching will make you sick...every time Craig or Kevin moves there is ghosting of the image...its really and truly stomach turning. Too bad because it sounds like a great interview....I'm not sure if its crappy authoring to DVDR ...that format certainly doesn't come with those problems.  This is like the early early video drag without the faded color.,1301616000,,395,5.171875
8407541,1,B003WUYGF0,"This Chris Mallick guy stole millions of dollars from clients of his epassporte internet billing company. Google Chris Mallick  or epassporte for more info on his shady past,lawsuits,tax problems and scams .",1295222400,,207,5.46875
8407542,5,B003WUYGF0,"I don't own this DVD, but did see the live streaming episode when broadcast. Chris Hardwick (The Nerdist) is the greatest, and this is a pretty good interview. Love Pollak's Chat Show for the funny, relaxed, uncensored long-format interview which is unlike anything you'll see on broadcast TV. Thanks Kev and crew!",1292371200,,314,5.0576923076923075
