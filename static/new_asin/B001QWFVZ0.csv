Rating: 5/5

Personally, I really enjoyed this production by National Geographical Chanel and I gave it a full rating. The first reason why I liked it is because it wasn't a movie that simply dumped facts of Buddhism. Instead, it was more interesting because we were able to see the experience of Wade Davis encountering Buddhism in the foothills of Himilayas. For instance, the movie displayed Daviss experience of Tibetan pulse diagnosis. Pulse diagnosis, which is when tibetan doctors read pulses to find the nature of the disease, is a method that is recognized by westerners to be extremely precise. However, this movie was more fascinating by presenting Daviss actual experience. This way, I could observe how pulse diagnosis actually worked.

Another reason why I enjoyed this movie is because there were metaphors that helped me understand the true esscence of Buddhism. For example, I had known before watching the movie that Buddhists believe the material world will cause suffering and not happiness. I have never truly embraced the meaning of that and I used to be slightly confused with that concept. However, in the movie, Matthieu Ricard said that finding happiness in the materialistic world is kind of like Running after a rainbow, hoping that we can wear it as a dress. This metaphor helps me understand that people often find wrong ways of achieving happiness, and simply runs further towards suffering.

Furthermore, this movie was quite fascinating because it connected Buddhism really close to science. For instance, it is often said that people who practice meditation transcends and become different. This movie proves it to be scientifically true because scientists hooked machines to those who practice meditation and found that their brains and minds are unalike normal people. This helps me understand that meditating can literally transform the human being in scientific ways.

Another reason I liked the movie is because it shows misconceptions of Buddhism that exists from other cultures. For example, many think that meditation is achieved by trying to stay still, blank out, and reduce the freedom of the mind to control it. However, in Buddhism, the true way of achieving it is to be aware of whats going on in your mind. To Buddhists, the mind is like a butterfly; it flies around for no reason. It is important to acknowledge that and guide the mind back to the right place away from distraction. This way, one can be charge of their mind and be the master of the mind.

Finally, I liked this movie because it compared its teachings with other cultures. For instance, it talks about how we try to live as long as we can, using medical support to stay healthy. On the other hand, Buddhists try to find meaning to life, and each moment is precious to them. Also, Buddhists spend their whole lives getting ready for death, while we pretend it does not exest. Instead, we race against time, and find success by measure of material world, books, academic degrees, or credentials of one sort or another. To Buddhists, this is the essence of ignorance.

This movie was very educational and shows the remarkable experience of Wade Davis. At the same time, it is also interesting and I enjoyed it a lot. I strongly recommend this movie to those who want to learn about the deeper meanings of Buddhism.",1449446400,,3796,4.945054945054945

Wade Davis explores the truths of Buddhism through a journey into the Himalayas. He begins his journey on a helicopter, where he meets his guide who is a doctor. Inside the monastery the monks and nuns are consistently chanting prayers. In the monastery he meets Venerable Trulshik Rinpoche, who is said to be a Bodhisattva. Davis learns the main goal of Buddhism; embrace compassion, and be compassion. They then visit the Lions Cave, where Venerable Trulshik Rinpoche is said to have become enlightened. It is believed that his teacher came to him in the form of an eagle and asked Venerable Trulshik Rinpoche to join him away from samsara, but Venerable Trulshik Rinpoche wanted to stay and help others achieve what he had. Davis meets Matthieu Ricard, a French munk. They head out to a mountain top with spiritual significance, and arrive at the Shiwan monetary for a festival celebrating the arrival of Buddhism in Tibet. There is music and dances with masks symbolizing Buddhist teachings. They then head to the flank of Everest, where Om Mani Padme Hum, a nun, lives. She has been in solitary retreat for 45 years, chanting 3 mantras over and over. Through these experiences, Wade Davis learns more about the depths of Buddhism.

Impression
I really enjoyed the movie especially because of the lessons that were extracted from it. I could also connect to the landscape well because of visiting Tibet. Seeing the prayer flags rustling gently in the cool breeze of the mountain top made me feel calm, just as it did when I was in Tibet. The camera angles really added to the peacefulness, Im not completely  sure how. This might have been done by having some from the ground upwards, focusing on the sky and trees. I also noticed that when they were discussing about living in the moment, I smiled a lot. I realized just how important every instant is, that we should be thankful even for time. Matthieu Ricard said, People wish happiness but run towards suffering, which I find much truth in. We want to be happy, yet we are always desire more, which is the main cause of suffering or stress, as stated in the four noble truths. Venerable Trulshik Rinpoche engages them in a conversation about the four noble truths, which Wade Davis says is so much more amazing than any other way hes ever learnt about them. Having tried to meditate before, I understood when Wade Davis was speaking to Matthieu Ricard about how theres more activity in your mind when trying to calm it. Matthieu Ricard tells him in reply that he may think there are more thoughts, however, theres just as many. Its only that you become aware of all of them, so it feels like more. Its a very logical explanation which will be able to help people persevere in calming themselves, even when its not meditating. For some reason when humans know something is normal, and doesnt just happen to them, we relax. The film also mentioned that finding serenity through Dharma validates the Buddhist science of mind just as a falling apple validates gravity. By comparing it to something so simple to us, we can better understand what exactly the science of our mind is. I was fascinated by that idea that the East prepare their entire life for one moment, while the West try to ignore it. This moment is death. Death isn't really something you can ignore, no matter how hard you try, as the Buddha found out. I realized through this film that there isn't any point in trying to ignore or fear something you know will happen, and to savor every moment of time.
