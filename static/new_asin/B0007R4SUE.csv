8050918,2,B0007R4SUE,"I've bought it for a great while but didn't have a chance to check it how this dvd works. I played it today, 01/16/12. What I saw was nothing. I thought something wrong with my cptr. I tried three more different movie dvds. Mine work fine. So, that dvd I bought didn't work on my cptr. The bonus music cd works though. That's bad, isn't it? I kept the dvd anyway but will not buy anything from Cal Pozo's dance series from now on.",1326672000,,430,4.130952380952381
8050919,5,B0007R4SUE,Excellent dvd instructions--easy to learn from.  Cal Pozo dvd's are difficult to find--thanks Amazon! Very fast delivery in less than a week.,1279497600,,141,5.409090909090909
8050920,5,B0007R4SUE,I have 2 of Cal's cd's and this one though older is easier to follow.,1186358400,,69,3.6666666666666665
8050921,1,B0007R4SUE,"I borrowed the DVD from the Library and I am shocked and appalled that they wasted public money on it.  OK, you might learn the basic steps, but it is painful to watch.  The instruction is weak.  The dancers have no sense of rhythm and they are out of step.  There is no sense of the beauty or sensuality of dance.  Cal Pozo did demonstrate the steps, but he did it without music, so I never saw him dance.  You can learn a lot more, for free, in a few minutes on the web, i.e. google or YouTube search for ""Cha cha"", etc.

Disclaimer: I was so impressed with the first disc, I did not bother with the second.  Perhaps it is filled with stellar performances.  I'm not gonna bother to find out.",1177977600,6,693,4.150375939849624
8050922,1,B0007R4SUE,"I bought these dvds two weeks ago, the cover looks shine, seem very attractive, elegant and professional, but they are just models for the marketing,they are not the teachers (the dvd's content is totally the opposed to the cover). This is worse Learn Salsa dvd than I have bought. Why? Body position is incorrect, position of the knees very bad, they do not dance with the beat of the music, this dvd teach only the basic step but in the incorrect way. You are going to pay to learn only the basic step in the worse way. Mr Cal Pozo is not a Salsa dancer, at least in this generation!",1138665600,14,585,4.327272727272727
8050923,4,B0007R4SUE,"All of Cal Pozo's videos are great.  They are fun, simple to understand yet challenging, and a bit cheesy (but in a good way). They explain the male and female steps, show foot prints on the screen, demo in half time and normal time (really good for latin/salsa steps which are usually quick), plus show it from different angles. I recommend any of his videos!",1129593600,5,360,4.538461538461538
