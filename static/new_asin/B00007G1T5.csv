Though it was a B Western, I really enjoyed it.",1433894400,,125,4.04

It opens on Col. Ben Halls Rodeo Ranch. Jim Wright and Skeeter talk, then Jim rides a horse. They are hired. Some cowboys catch wild mustangs for money. One cowboy was hurt. That wild Palomino is worth $1,000 for the rodeo. Who will catch this Devil? Stepin Fetchit does a skit with a stubborn mule. A man hides a small money bag in the fireplace, then runs away. Jim and Skeeter meet a Range Detective (hired by the Cattlemens Association). Then they use a horse to distract the palomino so they can rope bring it in. This provides a nature lesson. It works! But someone opened the gate to let the horses out. Skeeter finds a man, there is a struggle and a shot. Jim learns what happened! The Sheriff shows up and arrests Jim for this murder. On the way in a man shoots the Sheriff. Jim tries to help him.

The wild palomino attacks Jim, but he is rescued. The show placard advertises the devil horse. People will get their money back if the show isn't as advertised. The rodeo begins. There is a horse race and the usual rodeo events. That palomino attacked a man! Gil Davis sees Jim then rides away. Who will take his place? Jim replaces him in the show and rides the palomino who bucks and jumps. Then the Sheriff takes Jim away. Helen Hall visits Jim in jail. Stepin Fetchit tries to visit Jim (for comedy). Can Jim prove that Gil did the murder? Jim gets out and goes looking for Gil. Jim ropes Gil on a little-used road. The Sheriff rides by and captures Gil. Jim has tamed the devil horse.

This is an average story that shows life on a rodeo ranch, one that provides entertainment to people in the rural west. Rodeos demonstrate the skill used in ranching (roping, riding, etc.). It is comparable to the contests for those who could plow the straightest furrow. This was based on a story in Cosmopolitan Magazine, a publication that now seeks a different audience. Note how Stepin Fetchit got top billing over other characters.",1405382400,,1959,4.481792717086835
7975745,5,B00007G1T5,I don't think it was Hoot doing the rodeo scenes...but they were great. Just fun to watch an old cowboy flick.,1403395200,,110,4.285714285714286
7975746,5,B00007G1T5,"Wonderful B western.  I've just discovered Hoot Gibson.  His early ""talkies"" are best in my opinion.  These stories have more variety and naturalness.  He has all the skills of a bonifide cowboy on par with John Wayne.  His personality is easy going and appealing.  The story is about a new comer to a rodeo company.  The boss wants a wild horse that has avoided capture and offers a generous reward to anyone who can bring him in.  Hoot takes up the challenge with a clever plan.  Someone else wants the reward too and Hoots partner is killed in the effort.  Hoot is blamed for the murder.  He wasn't an eyewitness to the murder so he has to prove his innocence and get the horse back.  I would recommend this movie to all western B movie fans.",1388275200,,745,4.397058823529412
7975747,5,B00007G1T5,"Good fun and holds up surprisingly well.  If you are a fan of westerns, you will enjoy watching this one.  My first view of a Hoot Gibson western, and it was enjoyable.",1377820800,,168,4.21875
7975748,5,B00007G1T5,"According to the Alpha dvd jacket sleeve Hoot Gibson ""...considered his part in the fast-paced western WILD HORSE to be his favorite among all his starring roles."" I would have to agree with the HOOTER. A HUGE star in the silent era, Hoot Gibson was one of the few cowboy heroes whose screen presence benefited from the arrival of sound, although his career did not. The major studios felt westerns had no place in talkies and Universal dumped Hoot forcing the star to hang on with poverty row studios. Ensuing court battles kept Hoot off the big screen for a couple years and by the time he was ready to hop back into the saddle singing cowboys were becoming the craze. Hoot, Ken Maynard, Tom Mix, Tim McCoy, Buck Jones & others were suddenly old-timers.
WILD HORSE is one of the truly GREAT low-budget B-Westerns! And Alpha's dvd print is outstanding! Some minor speckling, some scratches, some noise distortion, nothing to distract from viewing enjoyment. This print is beautiful, especially for a film released in 1931. Sharp, crisp images with background depth, clear and detailed...a visual treat!
Hoot and sidekick Skeeter try to capture the wild Devil Horse for the rodeo, but Edmond Cobb kills Skeeter and steals the horse leaving Hoot to be blamed for murder. This could well be Cobb's best preformance in a B-Western. He gets lots of screen time in a meaty role.
Likeable Bill Robbins who plays unlucky Skeeter was unlucky in real life as well, being killed in an automobile accident shortly after this film was made.
Stepin Fetchit's humor is embarrasing and could be done without.
Hoot is simply great, as quick with his wit as with his gun. Silent films could never showcase Hoot's humor to such an advantage! And it's Hoot's humor and line delivery that make this film seem so fresh, even today.
WILD HORSE is a must see for fans of B-Westerns and Hoot Gibson, and the Alpha dvd is the one to get.
My HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!",1184716800,4,1939,4.739644970414201
