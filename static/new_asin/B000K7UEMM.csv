8154772,5,B000K7UEMM,"FOR FANS OF SCTV, SNL & The RED GREEN SHO!!!  A chance to learn about the rise of the starts of these shows.

First to clear up some confusion, this DOCUMENTARY is about the Second City stage group which SCTV spun off of and SNL hired away the talents of. However, SCTV is prominently talked about in the middle 43 minute segment.  Red Green's Patrick McKenna (Harold) is interviewed & talks about his days on the Second City stage performing with Ryan Styles & Colin who later went on to WHO'S LINE IS IT ANYWAY?.

My only wish at times is that the interviewees would shut up during the classic footage of the late 1950's & early 1960's. This is our only chance to see it & they are talking over it!

That gripe aside, this is a fairly comprehensive overview of the Second City troupes, both Chicago & Toronto.  It is broken up into a three-part documentary produced by Canadian television.
Part one covers the Second City troupe before SCTV.
Part two centers on the SCTV show itself.
Part three returns to the Second City troupe after SCTV spun off of Second City.

I did not realize that SCTV was not officially a part of Second City after its first season, they were let loose to continue with their show.

This documentary lasts over 2 hours and is filled with rare vintage recordings of the live stage performances as well as clips from SCTV.  While John Belushi gets mentioned & pictured, any recordings of his performances for The Second City are not presented here. Little from the late 1960's & early 1970's is presented here.

The bonus material consists of extended interviews, but I really wish it was the extended uninterrupted performances from the classic footage.

Either way, this is a must-have for any fans of these performers.",1270944000,3,1747,4.621359223300971
8154773,1,B000K7UEMM,SCTV ONE OF THE GREATEST IN COMEDY-HAS JUST BOMBED!! THIS IS LIKE A INTERVIEW NOT THE SHOW BIG DIFFERENCE....I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED.NISHEKO,1197504000,,139,5.363636363636363
8154774,3,B000K7UEMM,"I somewhat enjoyed this series of 3 specials made for Canadian TV. However with the exception of Tina Fey and Rachael Dratch there is no focus on any comedians spawned from Chicago past 1990. I was pleased with the first 2 segments, which chronicled its beginnings in Chicago in the 50's through SCTV in the 80's, but the third segment left me unsatisfied. George Wendt, Shelley Long, Tim Kazurinsky, Mary Gross, Dan Castellaneta, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Bob Odenkirk, Steve Carell, Paul Dinello, Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert; these are just some noteworthy alumni which are NOT EVEN MENTIONED in this series.",1172361600,6,612,5.069306930693069
8154775,5,B000K7UEMM,"I was able to watch an advance sample of this DVD collection and was very impressed. Frankly, I had thought that it might be a bit boring. But the interviews with Second City members (back to Alan Arkin, who I didn't even know was a member!) were great. There are some samples of Second City shows that I had never seen before and LOTS of trivia that I had never heard. Based on what I saw, I can definitely recommend this collection. I can't wait to watch all of this one!",1168473600,5,473,4.208791208791209
