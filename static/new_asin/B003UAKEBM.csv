8405740,2,B003UAKEBM,"I ordered this film on faith. IFC usually does do a decent job with movies (ie: Would you rather, or Dead Snow). Sadly, my faith was rocked with this one.

Paintball is basically a weekend warrior scenario that goes wrong when someone starts to play for real. You have some bad over acting, story is long, and no real motive was given as to why the guy goes nuts. You might be able to make a drinking game out of this, just not sure how yet.",1382227200,,441,4.127906976744186
8405741,4,B003UAKEBM,"Im a fan of fast paced action, but not hollywood style action, more of Hurt locker, saving private ryan, and district 9 action with the camera constantly moving and running. This film had exactly that, and the lack of background music made it more intense. Other reviewers are right that there is alot of screaming, but then again, its a bunch of everyday people being shot and and killed, i think we all would start screaming as well
Overall, the acting is so so, cinematography was spot on for this type of film, and the idea was pretty good. I wouldnt say it's the best ever, but i'd recommend it.",1323475200,,600,4.463636363636364
8405742,1,B003UAKEBM,"I usually give the movie the benefit of the doubt but this movie was BAD!  The acting was terrible. You don't like any of the characters. Most of the plot doesn't make sense and is hard to follow.  This isn't a ""haha"" that was a really funny bad movie, it's just straight bad.

Basic plot, a bunch of paint ballers from all over the world go on this adventure and immediately get attacked by someone using real ammo, and then all the characters start crying whining to each other the whole time.  There's no lead up to the action, or anything that explains each character. That's pretty much it.  And one guy keeps walking around pointing his stupid pistols with paint balls in them for protection.  By the middle of the movie, you really want all of these people to be shot.  As the other guy who actually watched this movie said, if you want to waste 90 minutes of your life you wish you had back, go for it.",1304467200,3,910,4.317647058823529
8405743,1,B003UAKEBM,"First of all, if you really want to waste 90 minutes on this movie, I highly suggest that you rent this piss poor excuse for a movie. This is the inbred film of The Tournament and Saw. I saw this in the store but never before then. I picked it up to read the movie bio and it seemed like something I would watch.

This movie had potential all of the first 5 minutes. After that, you really have to force yourself to finish. The only reason I wanted to finish was to figure out what the hell was going on (still a bit lost). The acting is absolutely disgusting. The characters are constantly yelling and screaming at each other over top of one another. You can barely understand what they are saying. The sound is atrocious. One minute I have to turn the tv up to hear what is being said, then the next, my eardrums are begging for mercy. There is little to no background music. All you hear are the sounds of the environment; the whole movie pretty much.

This crap was so unrealistic, I constantly felt as if my intelligence was being insulted. I mean, the ""Hunter"" walks around with thermal vision goggles and things are appearing hot that shouldn't be. How can a paintball gun, the whole gun, muzzle to stock be lit on thermal? Paintball guns do not give off heat when fired, let alone heat the entire gun. That was just an example. The characters from the thermal perspective looked like computer graphics more than humans. Don't even get me started on the blood and gore. All in all, pass this doody up. If you must watch, RENT! Do yourself at least that favor since you will be kicking yourself for wasting 90 minutes of your life you will never get back.",1286150400,5,1661,4.372168284789644
