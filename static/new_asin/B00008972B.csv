1829553,5,B00008972B,This was hilarious. Its a good theater flick regardless of what people say. Nothing like watching it and cracking up along with everyone else in the theater...good stuff.,1035590400,,170,5.107142857142857
1829554,5,B00008972B,"OK, if you are reading this and haven't seen the movie, it was amazing, go see it now.  You'll laugh your ... off, I know i did.  This movie was so damn funny, some things were really sick, others were unforgettable(the car up the ...).  The whole snow cone thing was really disgusting.  From the opening credits to the end, i could not stop laughing.  If you love the show, go and see this, its so much better than the show.  Steve-O's tattoo's are really great.  With that, im done.  It was an amazing movie, i hope they put it back on MTV.",1035504000,,542,4.194174757281553
1829555,5,B00008972B,"I've seen Jackass on MTV and that was funny, but the Jackass movie is more than 100 times funnier! I was laughing throughout the entire movie.  I liked all the stunts they were doing including the shopping cart scene and the rental car bash.  If you like the Jackass that is on TV, you'll LOVE the movie! I rate this movie a 5+ out of 5 because of its content.  I want the DVD if it comes out and I want to see this movie again!  This is a highly recommended movie!",1035504000,,465,4.021739130434782
1829556,5,B00008972B,"The crowd for this movie was enormous, so it was a good thing I bought my tickets in advance.  Every seat in the theater was filled, and I could barely hear myself think over the din.  When the movie started, everyone quieted down for a moment, and from the first sequence on, I could barely hear the movie over the laughter from the crowd and myself.  I found this to be one of the most funny movies I have ever seen--I don't think I stopped laughing for more than enough time to catch my breath throughout it.  The stunts performed are all excellent, and they are all extravagant enough for the big screen.  Knoxville and his crew wreak havoc, and many of the stunts occur in Japan.  This was not a low budget film; it must have cost MTV quite a small fortune.  This film is intended for immature audiences only--I doubt anyone that did not enjoy the show would like it, for stupidity is abundant, but some of the stunts are inventive.  So if you liked the TV show, you will definitely love this movie.",1035504000,,1004,4.360215053763441
1829557,5,B00008972B,"a lot of people are just not going to like this movie.  too bad for them.  because for the rest of us, the insane stunts and willingness of the cast to completely humiliate themselves for a laugh will remind you of the funniest class clown from your high school, with all inhibitions removed and amplified by the power of media exposure.  it's not high brow.  it doesn't compromise itself by even trying to be.  but it's certainly creative.  the challenge was to create the most ridiculous, insane and discomforting stunts ever, and these guys more than met the challenge.",1035504000,,572,4.7272727272727275
1829558,5,B00008972B,"Well, I just got back from the movie theater.  A buddy of mine works there and he invited me up tonight to watch the pre-screening of Jackass.  My body aches from laughing so much.  The total run time of the movie was about an hour and a half, but I swear it felt like maybe 20 minutes.  I definitely recommend this movie!",1035331200,,322,4.145161290322581
1829559,5,B00008972B,"The problem with Jackass is that it is not your run-of-the-mill comedy. As a result many people write it off as [junk]. They don't think about all the creativity involved. They think Seinfeld is the end-all-be-all of comedy (i.e. they think obvious humor with little creativity is the best). Don't get me wrong, I do actually like Seinfeld. And while this will seem ridiculous to many (close-minded) groups, Jackass is way ahead of its time.",1034812800,4,441,4.8933333333333335
1829560,1,B00008972B,"Jackass is quite possibly the stupidest, most low-brow comedy tv show i hav ever seen. ...i would much rather watch comedies that make you think and use punch lines that don't involve a visit to the emergency room.  the simpsons, seinfled and south park.  now those are real comedies. johnny knoxville is just some guy who ended up getting a show on mtv.  it's not like it's that hard, cuz they don't even play videos anymore.  but thats not the point.  jackass is stupid...",1030492800,14,474,4.595238095238095
1829561,5,B00008972B,"If you have seen the previews for Jackass and don't want to go see it yet, you have no personality.  It looks ten times funnier than the t.v. show that sends me rolling on the floor laughing.  My and my best buddy Lyndsey will be there the second it opens.",1029888000,2,256,4.1
1829562,5,B00008972B,"I am so happy that they are finally putting the greatest show, Jackass, on the big screen. Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam, Pontius, Wee-Man, and the other jackasses are going to make one of the funniest movies ever. Wheher its riding a shopping cart into a sidewalk or piercing your [body] together, this movie will make you pee your pants because IT IS SO FUNNY!!!!!

These guys really go above and beyond to be the best nice easy going Jackasses the world has ever seen.

They don't typically go out and ridicule 'other' people like MOST Jackasses do.  Offending and bothering to poor public...these guys are jackasses to each other mostly and just want to see YOUR Reaction to them being jackasses to themselves.

Sometimes they take it to the public and include them.  If they did include me without my knowledge, i don't know what would happen.  I just love these guys otherwise.  LOL.

1829597,3,B00008972B,"In the early 2000's a bunch of professional stunt performers decided to organise their pranks, skits and stunts into a movie - and 'Jackass' is the fruit of their work.

The movie is clearly fairly stupid and lacking in intellectual content - yet it does have a certain subtle message.  A number of critics have rightly pointed out how similar 'Jackass' is to the 'carnival' genre of art, recognised by Marxist theorist Bakhtin.  This genre of art undermines social convention through the use of low-brow humour (often relating to body functions, taboo subjects and sex) to expose the darker, less conscious and rational side of humanity.

Jackass is in a certain way a parody of American middle-class values and etiquette, as can be seen from many of the skits.  The deliberate harassing of Golfers at a wealthy country club using air horns, the wanton destruction of a rental hire car, the revolting defecation in a clean and shiny display toilet by a cast member in a typical suburban hardware store, and the many skits involving vomiting, farting, excretion and scatological themes (especially the 'Toy Car' skit involving a toy car being inserted into the nether regions of one of the cast) are a kind of 'finger' signal to a culture obsessed with avoiding risk, staying safe and making laws and rules to the point of absurdity.  While some of the skits are wildly funny, others push boundaries and any sense of decency, making you wonder how the cast members escaped facing lawsuits or criminal charges in some of the stunts.

The irony with Jackass is that the film stars (who perhaps apart from Knoxville and Steve O, lack any kind of real talent) made a huge amount of money from the film, which turned into a highly successful franchise with sequels and spin-offs.  In a way the Jackass crew ended up becoming what they parody, and now have countless cheap imitators of the same mindless stupidity that made them so popular.",1411430400,,1934,4.8217522658610275

That's still probably the best environment for this movie, though it also serves decently enough as a solo adventure. Wonderfully self-aware, it doesn't change a thing about what made the Jackass TV show so wildly successful, apart from upping the ante and lowering itself to a sick new standard of profanity. This crew is like a squad of old friends, gross and fun to be around, but also heavily influential in how you see yourself. I'd shake my head and click away if I stumbled across half of these stunts on YouTube today, but because it feels like I know these guys, and they're so clearly having the time of their lives cashing those fifteen minutes, it's absurdly easy to buy in and let the belly laughs sail.

I NEVER trash something that's primarily aimed at younger people and doesn't resonate all that much with me; I can usually find something to like about it.  But ""Jackass: The Unrated Edition""?  Okay, I'll start with something positive.  SOME of this movie is amusing and entertaining: the rental car that's returned after Johhny Knoxville enters it into a stock car race and trashes it thoroughly; the ""old man"" (one of the ""Jackass"" guys in make-up) who is caught shoplifting in a convenience store and keeps on shoplifting even after he's caught and repeatedly yelled at, and one or two other things.  But too much of this movie is just gross and/or stupid.  Maybe that's the point, I don't know.  But wincing at numerous scenes of self-mutilation and self-induced vomiting wasn't fun or entertaining but, well... wince-inducing.  But too each his or her own.  This unrated edition contains a longer cut of the original theatrical release of the movie, as well as more extra scenes among the special features.  Knock yourself out if this is for you-- it's certainly a generous DVD.  But I think I'll go watch something else now.",1207872000,3,1186,4.9393939393939394
1829615,5,B00008972B,"KNowing what to expect coming in, ""Jackass"" fullfilled all my expectations and also surpassed them. For those who don't know, they film is a string of short stunts by a group of very brave/foolish skaters who are constantly testing the bounds of their own destruction and torquing unsuspecting bystanders in the process. Imagine the old ""Candid Camera"" show on PCP. Yeah, way cool!
The first scene made me fall in love with the concept when Johnny Knoxville with a straight face tries to return a trashed rental car he's just used for demo derby and ask earnestly for his deposit to be returned. Other highlights are ""mobile roller disco"", the human mouse trap and some of the stupidest(but funniest)destructive and dangerous concepts you will be glad someone else is doing.
Editing is great, the director transitions from stunt to stunt without trepidation or hesitation. I could have watched another hour of this without tiring.",1203292800,4,930,5.045454545454546
1829616,4,B00008972B,"Jackass: The Movie

Jackass: The Movie is made up of all the dumb, mindless pranks you'd expect of a college fraternity without any adult supervision.

The movie including the DVD is not without merit, however.  If you have an annoying neighbor with teenage boys this might make an ideal Christmas present.  You'd want to give it anonymously, of course.

Sure there are warnings throughout the movie DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME.  You and I both know that a teenage boy is going to ignore those and try them anyway.  That's where the anonymity comes in handy,  Nobody can sue you.

Highly recommended for people with annoying teenage boys as neighbors and for any teenage boy you just don't like very much.

Some of the very best parts of the movie are the reactions of the people around these guys!

My own favorites scenes were the snow cone; the merry-go-round, the golf course airhorn (which is destined to be one of the all-time comic classics!) and the  falling-through-the-ceiling-at-the-office scene which follows immediately after; but the tour-de-force is the toy car x-ray (be sure to catch the reaction of the nurse when she reads the x-ray!).

This movie is worse than its reputation. Don't even bother watching it if you are the ""sensible"" type. It will just give you a conniption.

1829628,4,B00008972B,"If you're not familiar with the show Jackass (like me) don't go into Jackass: the Movie expecting any kind of plot.  The whole movie is just one outrageous and disgusting shot of video footage stunts that immediately goes straight into another, completely unrelated stunt.  In other words, the whole movie is just one disgusting (or just insanely funny) stunt after another.  No plot can be found.  This is probably a good thing.

Some of these stunts are really funny and hard to believe there are people out there who would actually perform stunts that could kill them if they landed the wrong way, or messed up in any kind of way whatsoever.  Wrapping yourself around a rope with a piece of meat hanging on your butt while alligators below try eating it is pretty insane.  Someone who is not a professional skater trying to go down a ramp on their very first attempt at such a stunt is insane, too.

Other stunts are there just to provide humor.  Stunts that are considered outrageous because of the fact that it's hard to believe someone would actually have the guts to walk into a store and do -without spoiling anything- insane stuff right in FRONT of people.  Some stunts are almost suicidal, while others just provide solid laughs.  And for the most part, they keep you interested.

One negative is that the guys spent too much time in Japan.  This means they spent a good amount of time making fun of the Japanese and the culture, which isn't really that funny in my opinion.  It's easy to make fun of another culture.  Everyone can make fun of America very easily, in fact.  Not funny.

I slice terribly, usually into other fairways, pissing off the other golfers.  It's so much fun annoying golfers.  Golfers are such pricks!  Screw them!

Sure, it would be easy to dismiss Knoxville and the others as mere idiots but, despite the MTV formula, the ideas are classic and recognisable to all who love slapstick - this is mearly a modern take on the Three Stooges, or Laurel and Hardy (though more painful!)

My personal favorite skit in the movie is ""Roller Disco Truck"".  I love the costumes, music and the whole set-up.  Of course the skit goes totally wrong (nobody can skate in a moving truck) but that's pretty much the point.

I have to say that, while at times very gross, this is one of those flicks where you laugh and laugh out loud. In fact, I watched the introduction four times by itself. Seeing them fly down a runway in a oversized shopping cart as they belted each other as giraffes crossed before them amid fireworks exploding was completely hilarious. Some of the skits are barely watchable-like Steve-o on the alligator tightrope. I have to say, for those of you who haven't seen it, that it's like Tom Green to the nth power. Jacka-s is some powerful and good stuff. Many of the skits take place in Japan which is the perfect background setting for this psycho stuff.

If you love stupid comedy then Jackass The Movie is right for you.

The movie is basically just an extended uncensored version of the show but it has some parts that are so much funnier than the show. Watch out for the uncensored picture of Chirs Pontius's Playgirl shoot in the documentary because I had the misfourtune of seeing it. The movie makes you laugh out loud countless times and you really wonder how far will these guys go. I'm amazed that Ryan Dunn shoved a toy car up his butt but I guess the money was worth it.

For one I thought there was a lot of Candid Camera/Tom Green rip off filler (shoplifting old guy, alligator in the kitchen, etc.) that was not funny in the least. The rest of the stunts were, in my opinion, not that outrageous.

Well, the movie is 10 times better, mainly because it's uncensored. At roughly 85 minutes, I did not stop laughing at any point during Jackass the movie. Some of the stunts in this film are somewhat crude but hey these guys are willing to do whatever they have to do to get you to laugh. Airhorn Golf is friggin hilarious, as the guys hit an airhorn as unsuspecting golfers are in their backswings. Knoxville takes a nasty spill on a golf cart and is knocked silly which is fun to watch. That isn't the only time that Johnny gets knocked unconscience because later in the film during the shopping mall boxing skit he gets pummeled by Butterbean, gets knocked out and is in his own words ""slightly concussed"". Alligator Tightrope is pretty funny as Steve-O tries to walk a tightrope over a pit of alligators with a piece of raw chicken dangling from his loin cloth. Yellow Snowcone is just plain foul, but funny. As is the sketch where one of the guys is holding in his bowl movement but finally craps himself in the car on the way to take a dump in a hardware store display toilet. The best sketch of the whole movie is probably when Ryan Dunn sticks a matchbox car up his heine and goes to the proctologist complaining of pain. He gets X-Rayed and you can actually see the car in his rectum. Now more then ever America needs renegade comedy and Johnny Knoxville and his crew of maniacs are writing the bible of extreme comedy before our very eyes.

Our voyeuristic ways have made us addicted to reality TV, no matter how lame and how stupid it may be.  Jackass is lame, stupid, disgusting...and downright funny as all get out.  I mean, I'm 40 and still found it funny, as sophomoric as it may be.  All the usual cast is here: Johnny Knoxville as the ringleader, joined by Bam Margera (along with his parents), Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Wee-Man, Ryan Dunn, and all the rest pulling off stunts too strong for regular TV.

Actually about the only real difference is that the movie doesn't edit out the swearing or the puking, such as when Steve-O snorts a line of wasabi and promptly hurls it up.  The stunts range from the wince-inducing giving each other papercuts, to the wiseguy antics of blowing an airhorn just as golfers are about to hit their shots, to the truly disgusting of Dunn sticking a toy car up his behind and going for an X-ray only to see the doctor's shocked response at what he sees on the film.

There's the usual craziness of the hit-n-run dashes into stores dressed as Panda bears or jousting as knights to the stunned faces of store patrons.  Or there's Pontius stripping down to a g-string and dancing provocatively in front of an elderly Asian man. Most of the stunts are just the typical stupid stuff likfe that.  The only thing I really had a problem was the boxing match that took place in a store pitting Knoxville against pro boxer Butterbean.  Butterbean pulled no punches as he pummeled the hapless Knoxville into a daze, resulting in several stiches to his head.  That part was not funny at all.

Other than that one caveat, I enjoyed the film.  yeah it's pretty juvenile but what's wrong with a little juvenile humor every now and then?",1119225600,3,1796,4.592476489028213

1829696,5,B00008972B,"When all is said and done, Jackass is something that either appeals to your sense of humour, or doesn't. It's as simple as that. If you loved the TV series, you'll adore the movie. If you didn't like the TV series, don't even bother watching this. It's exactly the same, although the movie stunts are a little more extreme.

If your sense of humour revolves remotely around intelligence or your films to challenge and engage you intellectually, forget this. Don't even bother with it. On the other hand if you are prepared to put your intellectual pride to one side for an hour or so and engage the same sense of humour you had before you got a responsible job, mortgage, kids and all the other outlook changing responsibilities of life, do yourself a favour and see this movie. Not everyone in adulthood can still laugh at the puerile and stupid things that would have had them howling as kids, but for those of us that can, this movie is a treat.

When I first saw the movie, the golf cart scene had me literally rolling around on the floor in tears. I haven't laughed so hard for years. It's one of those rare Jackass stunts that clearly goes wrong at the end, but that just makes it even more amusing. Other personal favourites are the scenes involving the ""old guys"" including Shoplifter and the guy falling asleep on his electric cart in the middle of the busy intersection. Puerile and stupid, but if your sense of humour extends to that, you cannot go wrong.

As with the series, some of it is hilarious, some of it makes you cringe, and some of it is just plain sick. However, it is a breath of fresh air in our litigious society where people are increasingly shrinkwrapped in cotton wool for fear of personal injury lawsuits. These guys went against the grain and made a lot of money, and gained international recognition by enjoying themselves, acting like total idiots and entertaining others. Whether you like them or not, it's impossible not to respect them for it.

If you get off watching an entire movie of young guys naked, shoving stuff up their butt, playing with themselves, defecating, vomiting, urinating, eating their own waste, tying objects to and playing with their genitalia, and otherwise humiliating/degrading themselves its because you are gay - and into wierd fetish sex stuff - or are a closet homo, fighting with your sexual urges and confused about your identity.

Take the scene where the guy urinates on a snow cone, eats it, vomits, eats vomit, other guys kick him and beat him up. Hmmmm. Ha ha. Funny. Really... Apparently this passes for humor these days.

What's really funny is how this movie got by without an X rating. They used to call this stuff gay porn/scat/S&M, etc., and you had to go to the local seedy adult porn shop in the sticky section to find it - now apparently its popular culture and ""Ho Ho, Ha Ha, gut-splitting HI-larious entertainment the whole country will love."" Just goes to show how low Hollywood will sink to make a buck - and how irrelevant the MPRA is. What's next - snuff films and kiddie porn go mainstream?

A sign of the apocalypse? Gee, you think? Uh, Jesus, any time yer ready - don't think we could get any more debased as a society here....

Anyway, like I said, check this movie out if you enjoy gay porn or latently homoerotic, wierd, masochistic, scat stuff - and make sure to pretend its ""funny"" so that people don't confuse you for not being ""straight.""

Really, guys - this is the 21st century. Its time for Johny Knoxville and his army of jergoff, pent-up homos to come out of the closet. Society is a lot more open and accepting than you'd think. The only thing these guys don't do if bukkake eachother - yet, anyway - but if they do, make sure you pretend its ""funny.""

Being openly gay and having a normal sexual relationship is a lot more healthy than filming your buddies shove hotwheels in their rectum. Jackass the Movie is a case study of what goes terribly, terribly wrong when people with repressed and unhealthy sexual urges and identity, get messed up on drugs and alcohol and lose their inhibitions in front of a camera.

Hey, if watching naked men do strange, sick stuff to themselves is what rocks your boat - that's your bag I guess, but just don't pretend you like it because its ""funny.""  Better yet, get out of the closet.",1104969600,6,2413,4.564814814814815

The one stunt, where the guy eats a ""yellow"" snow cone almost made me gag.

Here are my top 5 favorite skits:

1. Golfcourse Airhorn (Johnny Knxoville, Dave England, Ehren McGeney)

2. Party Boy Japan (Chris Pontius)

3. The Gong (Preston Lacy, Johnny Knoxville)

4. Big Cone (Wee Man)

In the scheme of what is inventive and truly enjoyable, I'll take Jackass over Akira Kurosawa or Jean-Luc Godard any day.

 Sure, maybe I'm a little immature, but I know I'm not a complete moron. The creativity and sheer audacity of the Jackass performers (Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera, Chris Pontious, Preston Lacy, etc.) had me sick with laughter for 80 straight minutes, causing me to pause the film numerous times just to catch my breath.

 They total a rental car in a demolition derby and return it to the rental agency refusing to pay for the damages. They blow airhorns at a golf course just as the golfers are about to hit the balls. Chris Pontious terrorizes the people of Japan in a g-string and a bow-tie. Steve-O walks a tightrope over an alligator pool with raw chicken stuffed in his pants. Johnny Knoxville gets shot in the abdomen with a riot-squad ""less-lethal"" beanbag. There are bottle rockets tied to penises, experiments with electronic muscle stimulators on genitals, and some guy even craps his pants.

 It is, quite simply, one of the funniest things I have ever seen. And no, I'm not going to justify my enjoyment with some haughty, multi-syllabic, sociological examination in a pathetic attempt to prove myself to other pretentious film critics.

1829707,4,B00008972B,"Okay, I wasn't too thrilled at the whole concept of the idea of a really dumb show actually being made into a full-length feature film and was literally put off by it until I stumbled upon this on cable recently and the result though for me, cut extreme ways for me being a mix of truly funny, genius stunts and disasters, to average ho-hum stunts to sickeningly stupid and vomit-inducing without being funny.
 Okay so this isn't actually a movie at all. No script, no plot, but just plain hodgepodge of stunts, ""Jackass: The Movie"" is designed to really offend some, yet really entertain others too. For me, this does both on an enormous scale.
 Starring Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, and a bunch of other misfit punks, these guys are not just some drunk delinquents who are finding stunt ideas to entertain, these people are actually trained professional stuntmen who are highly trained and thus, kids out there who watch this should NEVER, EVER try to perform any of the stunts in this film.
 In any case, some of the pranks are absolutely a riot to watch. I find it amazing how someone could actually jump on a mini-trampoline and crash right through a ceiling fan going at high speed and crash onto a small wooden table that collapses under the velocity of him landing on it. I was laughing so incredibly hard at it that I hurt my lungs because it was so funny and also because I have a love for slapstick and this is the best slapstick crash I've ever watched on TV. Other numerous pranks pulled off by these Jackasses are also a riot to watch. The 'ceiling fan' stunt is a favorite but another one that also made me scream with laughter is the bowling alley one in the beginning that made me laugh so hard that I literally hurt my lungs.
 However, some of the antics pulled off are absolutely sickening to watch and two in particular were just extremely gross and enough to make you want to throw up after watching and want to take a bath with lots of cleaning substances........and this is without being funny by any stretch of the imagination. One of them risks spreading harmful bacteria and is very unsanitary.
 However, the last one in this movie combines the sickeningly gross qualities of the worst parts of the movie and the worst of what the entertainment industry has to offer. It's really quite sickeningly stupid and really tasteless in an unentertaining way and really damages a lot of what could have others been good about the latter part of this 'movie'. The ending however that takes place 60 years in the future is really funny and brings this mixed bag of a DVD to a glorious conclusion.
 This isn't a movie at all. It has NO script, no plot, just plain pranks played by professional stuntmen and while some are really stomach turning, most of them are really funny to watch, that is if you can bypass some of the obscene nature of some of them. We all have some 'jackass' in ourselves but this really brings out the 'jackass' in these guys and let me tell you, the title of this 'movie' is perfect. Be mindful though that not only is there some really disgusting content but also highly masochistic behavior and some of the stunts are really dangerous!!
 So take off your thinking cap, put the school/college books on the shelves and share a laugh or two and perhaps have a barf bag with you if you are a bit queasy plus have a DVD remote to bypass the more offensive stunts. It is certainly offensive to a high degree especially to the mature audiences but also has lots of entertaining slapstick stunts. The critics hit the nail on the head by saying that this may very well be 'the Decline of Western Civilization as We Know it'.",1089158400,6,3669,4.533232628398792

You will wince in pain, feel a few disgusted gurgles in your belly, and feel totally offended but you will still watch the antics of these crazy dudes!

1829715,5,B00008972B,"When Jackass hit the MTV airwaves, it made waves across all of pop culture. The guys from underground sensation CKY (Bam Margera, Brandon DiCamillo, Ryan Dunn, etc.) teamed up with Johnny Knoxville's group to produce three seasons of one of the most outlandish, outrageous, and hilarious shows of all-time. After their controversial, highly-rated MTV run, the guys decided on a new venture. They announced a movie that, they claimed, featured all the stunts they ""weren't allowed to do on television"". As frightening as that statement was, it turned out to be true!
All the things that Jackass fans wanted to see but knew they couldn't during the years on MTV come to life...uncensored. From renting a car and using it in a demolition derby (incidentally the FIRST scene of the movie) to Ryan Dunn getting beat up by a girl to Steve-O firing off bottle rockets from a body orifice that wasn't created for that purpose, the Jackass crew goes all out for 90 minutes plus on the big screen. The best sign of how good it is: the opening credits will have you laughing before any of the stunts even start! With an additional 30 minutes of unseen footage as a special feature of the DVD, as well as a montage of the wrap-up party with a performance by Andrew W.K., the special features add up nicely as well.

1829739,4,B00008972B,"It's brilliant to see critics calling this ""the final nail in the coffin of civilisation"". JACKASS is a movie devoid of any  historical & (almost) educational merit. It's the kind of movie that has prim & prudish prats wondering what the World is coming to. Bear in mind however, that these are the same people who read the ""uncensored"" Enid Blyton works such as ""Noddy"" & ""The Three Golliwogs"" as children & spent many summer vacations at the beach encouraging Punch to bash Judy's head in; all in the name of entertainment. Some people have very short (or selective) memories indeed.
Strange; because in JACKASS: THE MOVIE you won't find any implicated homosexual acts (unlike its predecessor CKY), overt racism or acts promoting or supporting murder or abuse. It's all done for LAUGHS!!
Brought to the big screen by the makers of the TV series; Jeff Tremaine, Johnny Knoxville & Spike Jonze; the JACKASS team deliver what fans of the show have come to expect. Here's a run down of what you can expect:
*  Entering a rental car in a demolition derby with a blow-up sex doll as a passenger- with Slayer's ANGEL OF DEATH playing on s/t.
*  Steve-O getting up close & personal with some crocodiles during feeding time.
*  Bam Margera setting fireworks off in his parents bedroom at 2am.
*  Using a display toilet in a hardware store (viewers get to see the ""evidence"" on camera).
*  Steve-O revisits his curry stunt (see: ""Steve-O Video Vol. 1"") in Japan, this time snorting wasabi & having a similar outcome. Only this time there's a LOT MORE vomit. Ditto the ""yellow snow cone"" stunt which has to be seen to be believed.
Other standouts include the toy car x-ray (that's ALL I'll say) & the guys attempting to return a ""used"" sex toy to an adult novelty shop. And much, much more.
JACKASS is a must see & (though most critics would never admit it)one of the most entertaining & hilarious films to come out in the past year. A perfect movie for watching with a group of friends, and with lots of pizza & beer handy.

1829741,3,B00008972B,"In Brief
Johnny Knoxville and his crew of crazies take the concept of the MTV show Jackass, that regularly saw a bunch of guys doing dangerous and disturbing stunts just to see what happens, and turns it into a movie.  Here they can get away with more than they could on TV, including a climatic stunt of extreme insanity!!
Review
While the extreme sports lifestyle & stunt home movies were the basis that Knoxville and co built upon with an insanity that gave us regular doses of laughter and gross outs, the movie continues in the same vein.  This is a film that knows its boundaries and doesn't exceed them.  A bigger budget hasn't meant the enforcement of a dodgy storyline or music video excessive style, but just gives the guys a chance to do bigger, better things, not only in the USA but Japan too.
This film is the biggest load of sh*t to have hit the screen in a long time, and its brilliant!  It's a film that doesn't care, as it bombards the viewer with a new stunt nearly every 2 minutes.  It succeeds in transferring to the cinema in a way that most TV crossovers don't, and is funnier than many of the `comedies' that have been around recently without even trying to pull a punch line and it certainly doesn't pull its punches either!
The only question that one must raise, is will it be funnier on a second viewing?  It may not have a long shelf life, but if you want to see a matchbox car drive where no man has gone before, fireworks launch from someone's rear, or man get beaten up by a girl ;0), the Jackass is certainly one for you!

The Verdict
You can't say too much about this film for fear of spoiling some the best moments it holds.  As surprised as I was, the film works, providing a great night out with moments that will have you rolling with laughter.  Get drunk, get some mates and see Jackass, but remember `whatever you do, please don't try this at home!'",1073433600,,1888,4.356125356125356
1829742,1,B00008972B,"This is by far the dumbest movie that I've seen so far.  The only things in it that I thought were kind of funny were the parts where Steve-O is trying to go across the pit full of aligators with dead chickens strapped to his butt and the part where Jhonny Knoxville is trying out the rocket skates in the park.  All in all I don't recomend this movie, it's just stupid.",1073347200,5,370,4.125
1829743,4,B00008972B,"What can I say? I love the TV show (one the of the few shows on MTV I actually do enjoy). I loved this movie and I laughed hysterically at it. Why do people find these disgusting and stupid things so amusing? Who knows? Who cares? It's funny. I don't feel as if I need to tell you what's in this movie because you've probably heard and if it seemed extremely disgusting and inhuman for a person to do then it was probably in this movie. The only scene I didn't enjoy was when he urinated on the snow cone then ate it that was disgusting and show of been left out. So should Chris Pontious and Steve-O. Minus the few select scenes that they have in the movie and shows combined I find them more annoying and disgusting than funny. As far as Knoxville, Bam, Wee-man, and the rest of the crew I love them and I hope they come out with another Jackass movie sometime soon. People know exactly what to expect from a movie like this so if you don't like the shows and don't like what you hear why watch it and post a review on it? To me that's as hard to understand as why people think this is funny. Whatever your preference may be (like Jackass or hate it) that still doesn't change the fact that I enjoyed this movie.

1829745,4,B00008972B,"Johnny Knoxville and his gang are nuts and they are ""pain-full"", painfully funny. Although I rented this and would never consider buying it, there were enough stupid and lame stunts (not to mention dangerous) that kept me amused. Please note that I also am fascinated by car accidents and other similar personal tragedies.
This group of spoiled rich kids does everything and anything an unbridled teenager gang could want to do and gets away with it (money and a victims sudden fame wins out every time). Who would not think that dangling your butt over a crocodile with a dead chicken hanging out is just nuts? Of course, you're intrigued to see if this idiot gets nailed. Renting a car and demolishing it only to return it to the agency claiming no responsibility is adolescent humor. But then the expected reaction from the owners are humorous. Setting off a barrel full of fireworks in Knoxville's parent's bedroom in the middle of the night is shocking. Not that they become frightened - they just stay in bed, seemingly used to this kind of crap (here goes Johnny again). Dad gets a surprise visit by Johnny and gets beat up on his toilet. Mom seems used to alligators in her kitchen as well. I could do without the one guy in his skivvies dancing around Tokyo to freak people out. That was just dumb. However, the list goes on.

This is not a good movie. This is not a high budget movie. This is lowbrow entertainment aimed at young kids and teenagers and it sells. It has merit only for the extremes this group will go to for a ""laugh"". Consider what you like. If forced paper cuts on your nose and between your toes or self-induced vomiting are your thing, you'll have a blast.

1829748,4,B00008972B,"""Jackass: The Movie"" brings the anctics of Johnny Knoxville and his crew to the big screen in a movie that is really a glorified edition of the MTV ""reality"" T.V. show.  Unlike the limitations they face on the censors of television, this group takes their bizarre combination of reckless stunts and gag humor to a whole new level of shock humor that will leave the audience clammoring for more, even as they reach for a  barf bag at some of the ""gags"" (literally) in this film.
The movie, which runs just a little over 70 minutes, is a little disappointing in its brevity.  Many of the shorts within the film (all filmed with a series of hand-held video cameras) are little more than elaborate pranks played on unsuspecting victims.  Some of these stunts, such as when one of the boys decides to deficate in a display model toilet inside a hardware store, are downright gross, and nothing is left to the imagination.  Others, as when Knoxville rents a car, enters it in a demolition derby, then returns the car later on a flatbed truck, demanding compensation for the rental of an unsafe vehicle, is genuinely hilarious.
The reason for the four star rating is that the movie, which did contain some incredibly funny skits, also meandered some, relying on staples from the television show that really had no business being elevated to the big screen.  Also, the movie's shortness of length left the audience wanting for more.  Finally, as this is a review of the DVD edition of this film, the last disappointment comes in the fact that the additions of extra footage available on the DVD were pretty disappointing as a whole.
Still, ""Jackass: The Movie"" won't disappoint.  For fans of the show, this movie is the culmination of stunts developed over the several seasons of the show on MTV.  For those who have never experienced Jackass, well, put your brain on hold and feel free to laugh at the mindless, outrageous, hilarious anctics of a group of men who really are a bunch of ""jackass""es.  Its fun in its stupidity, and worth at least a casual viewing.

One of theose movie that any guy between the ages of 12 and 27 will love and watch over and over again.
First let me say this, no girl I've ever seen this movie with has liked it. So if your a girl (unless your a fan of Jackass on mtv) I urge you to not even think about getting or renting this movie. Now Jackass The Movie can and will make anyone laugh. This movie will make the dumb (like myself) [urinate] there pants they've laughed so hard. What's the movie about you ask? Well if you've ever seen Jackass you already know. It's about a couple of idiots running around doing stupid things to get paid. They walk around in Panda suits (in Japan) stick cars up there [expletive],  and even dance around in thongs. it's alot of fun to watch and I guarantee you that if you have no morals at all you will laugh.

Launching a golf cart off a jump ramp? Walking a tightrope over a pond of snapping alligators wearing only a jock strap with a piece of meat sticking out the back? Wishing you were 30 so you could actually do it?
Welcome to Jackass, a non-stop orgy of stupid human tricks. Hilarious stupid human tricks. Done by 30-year-old guys. Out of the minds of their inner 9-year olds, Johnny, Bam, and the boys indulge the crazy fantasies that most of us had, but were too young to actually do, and too embarrassed to admit thinking about once we were old enough to do them.
The result is an hour and a half of pure ridiculousness that's guaranteed to make you moan, cringe, roll your eyes, and howl with laughter.
Sure, the themes get a little repetitive, as themes tend to do when you're 9: taking a vehicle and smashing it up; anything having to do with butts or nuts; jumping, crashing, or diving headlong into stuff.
Probably the most notable thing about Jackass is what's missing: any trace of pretense. At first, their antics make you cringe. But these guys are so uninhibited, especially in the stunts that involve butts and nuts, that you find yourself disarmed and laughing your ass off right along with them.
There is no thought given to cool. Fitting in is the last thing on their minds. There's no burden of any grown-up stuff, like sexual tension or exploitation. In fact, the only girls allowed are Bam's mom and a Japanese prize-fighting kick-boxer who leaves Brian Dunn spitting chicklets. Social conventions are left at the door when you enter the Jackass world. Jackass says that being human is funny. It's pure boyish abandon. And it's refreshing. It's freeing.

1829763,2,B00008972B,"**1/2 About the only thing that can be safely said about the gross-out fest Jackass  The Movie is that it is definitely an acquired taste.  You will be either delighted or appalled by the masochistic antics contained in this film, and if you ever needed proof that there is a distinct cultural divide existing in this nation today, Jackass provides it in spades.
For those who do not know, Jackass is the brainchild of Johnny Knoxville and his assorted buddies who have made a lucrative industry out of devising and performing death- and injury-defying stunts so that likeminded individuals, from the comfort and safety of their couches and theater seats, can at least get a vicarious thrill by watching others act out what they themselves wish they had the nerve (or stupidity) to do. (The film, of course, comes with a don't try this at home proviso that is as transparently insincere as it is obviously ineffective).  Jackass is like the ultimate boys-will-be-boys extravaganza, a fifth grade pranksters dream come true.  Not only do the men perform the stunts, but they spend most of their time in convulsive hysterics responding to them.  On-screen vomiting, defecating, intentional bloodletting and the imbibing of urine are just a few of the goodies offered up for the audiences delectation by the makers of the film.  Think of this as the dark side of the Peter Pan Syndrome, a tribute to adult men who have serious maturity issues and who clearly refuse to grow up.
Like most compilation films, Jackass  The Movie is a hit-and-miss proposition.  Some of the stunts are clever and amusing, and there is a certain anarchic kick to be derived from seeing these guys pushing back the boundaries of conventional common sense and good taste.  But theres also a certain mean-spirited tone to so much of what we see on screen that it interferes with our enjoyment of vast portions of the movie.  Personally, I don't care if these guys want to injure, maim or even kill themselves to get their kicks, but why do they have to get so many of their laughs at the expense of other people?  A number of the bits seem designed to do little more than humiliate hardworking business people, innocent bystanders and even members of their own families.  In making a cruel version of Candid Camera, the filmmakers only heighten their own smugness and attitude of superiority, helping to alienate all but the groups most fanatical followers.  What also surprises me  given the general nature of the films target audience, that is  is just how homoerotic in tone many of these stunts turn out to be.  Im not saying that as a judgment against the film, but I do find it to be an interesting observation.
I don't want to belabor the issues too much here, and I certainly don't believe that the success of this film (and the TV show that spawned it) in any way foretells the imminent collapse of Western Civilization, as others have charged.  That is clearly an overreaction.  Jackass  The Movie is obviously intended for a very specific niche audience and, in those terms, I guess, it gets the job done.  Just make sure you're in that niche before spending your hard-earned money to see it.  Youve been forewarned.",1061424000,2,3199,4.78

Then I acctually started watching the show and realized, these guys love it. It's just naturally funny to watch people(who want to) hurt themsleves, acctually succeed and with hilarious flair. I saw this movie with two of my friends the day after Halloween and we had honestly never laughed so hard, or been so grossed out and we spent the rest of the day re-accounting scenes from the movie. If you are not a fan of blood (such as my one friend whom i watched it with when it came out on video) certain parts may be too gross for you. But even I was rocking back and forth in my seat screaming ""Oh my god!"", when the paper-cuts scene came up (blood doesn't bother me too much). Believe me if you give Jackass a chance and just take it for face value, it's great. Even my friend who hated blood admitted that she liked it (and she is definately not the type to like thsi kind of thing). As for the DVD extras i reccommend the extra scenes, (the failed ending was HILARIOUS i didn't understand why they didn't just put it in the movie) and the commentary by both the cast and Johnny with the Directors (both are hilarious, and i never realized how many injuries these guys had until i heard them go ""o thats when i broke my ____"").

Well, Jackass the movie rocks by all means, it delivers pure jokes and very funny stunts and moves. They always keep showing ""Don't try this at home"" Warning description, well for God's Sake, who in the world will try these at home, I am not insane like these guys :o) Deadly stunts and sometimes you wanna puke after you see them. Jackass: The Movie is much much better than the tv show by all means, because in the movie they show you everything without censoring a $***, but in the tv show they put those beeps when the cast say a cuss word or if the stunt is too hot to show or graphic to show they blur it or put censorship on it. So I Highly Recommend Jackass: The Movie with the addtion to Don't Try This At Home: Steve-O Volumes 1 and 2.

I guess Johnny Knoxville needed an R-rated movie to show his boys puking in restaurants and crapping in hardware store toilet models.  I don't know how anyone can find that funny.  I have a sick sense of humor, but this stuff went beyond my level.
If there had been some kind of plot at least this might have gotten a 3 out of 5 for attempting something worthwhile for Jackass fans, but I guess that's to much to ask.  It staggers blindly from one scene to another and, as I said before, Knoxville couldn't resist not having his most disgusting stunts put on film.",1056672000,,743,4.36231884057971

See it if you enjoy the television show.

Avoid it if you would find these things offensive or disgusting to the point of dry heaving.

But the Jackass stunts (most of them) are just plain hilarious. The movie has no real plot line, just a bunch of insane, sometimes gross, stunts all strung together by the ten or so guys who pull them off. The Jackass bunch walk around Tokyo in panda costumes, hang off trees by their underwear, pole vault into trees and lakes, and give themselves papercuts. Among many, many other things. They are, quite simply, eight-year-old boys. But they're eight-year-old boys you love to laugh at. And the whole movie, they're laughing right along with themselves. If you like a good laugh and don't mind watching people hurl themselves into large objects and the like, I highly recommend Jackass. If you have a weak stomach for that sort of thing, don't go near it.

And, believe it or not, it's way funnier than it ever has a right to be. Considering that ""Jackass"" has no plot or performances, it's not really, in the classic sense, a movie and it shouldn't be reviewed as such. Based on the MTV show of the same name, it's a random collage of gross-out stunts performed by a bunch of dudes, and they push the raunch factor as far as an ""R"" rating can allow. Some are hilarious, and others just crash the ceiling of good taste. Johnny Knoxville and his cohorts go through a series of wild escapades that are not only extremely dangerous, but also humiliating. Who, in their right mind, would walk on a tightrope above a lake of raging crocodiles and wearing only briefs? Most of us wouldn't, but it's perversely fun to watch these dudes try. Highlights include snorting wasabi at a local sushi bar, applying electro shock pads to various body parts, lighting up huge fireworks indoors at the wee hours of the morning, shopping mall boxing, climbing over literally hundreds of live mousetraps, rollerblading with ""rocket skates,"" and getting a tattoo in a speeding Jeep with Henry Rollins.

I'm really,REALLY glad that I didn't pay full price to see this at the movies.
 I loved Jackass when it was on MTV..... but the movie just didn't make me laugh nearly as hard;in fact I kinda felt sorry for Knoxville and the gang. I feel like everyone was trying so hard to be explicit,that they forgot about being funny. In several skits you can almost tell that they are forcing themselves to laugh alot at stuff that's only mildly amusing.
 However there were some funny parts,all be it far and few inbetween:the night pandas skit,Wee Man in the cone,the golfers
and of course hearing Bam's dad cuss during the fireworks! By the way there SHOULD have been ALOT more Wee Man,and ALOT less of that one guy dancing as the male stripper. I can't think of his name,but he's my least favorite of the Jackass crew. Seeing that skit one time...maybe...would be funny...kinda...... BUT SIX TIMES!?Have the fast forward button on your remote handy.
 Some of the stunts were a little too hardcore for me A.K.A papercuts,baby croc clamping on a nipple,syringe to the back of the head,and shark stuck to arm. Also you can only think it's funny so many times to see someone throw up...then it just gets old. Lastly,I like nudity in my movies....FEMALE NUDITY! Why was there so much male nudity??Sorry but I don't,nor would I ever want to see THAT much of a Jackass. They could've at least hired a couple babes to take off their tops and even things out! It's almost like some of these guys are bisexual or something...
 Even with the ""bonus footage"" this DVD is not that great. Save your money and buy seasons 1 and 2 on DVD.They're alot funnier.",1053216000,,1697,4.590759075907591

If you don't like seeing things like people throwing up or being generally stupid, you won't like this movie.  Don't try and fool yourself by watching it thinking, ""I hate the show, but maybe I'll like the movie.""
For those who can read all the reasons why this movie was rated ""R"" and feel they won't be offended or grossed out seeing such things, you'll love this movie.  Unlike the show where they occationally take a short break to show skateboarding clips, the movie never takes a break.  I found myself slightly nautious at times, not because of the content, but because I laughed so hard my stomach went from hurting to nautious.
For those who don't own TV's and have never seen Jackass, the general concept is this.  Have you ever been sitting around and thought to yourself, I wonder what would happen if I ________?  Or, have you ever said to your friend, I dare you to ________?  Jackass is a bunch of guys who fill in the blanks and do them.  Why?  Because the get paid a ton of money to act dumb, laugh, and not work regular jobs.  Also known as what most people refer to as a ""dream job.""
Unlike the show, this movie has very little repetition.  You don't see the same joke done about 5 times throughout the show, making the movie only that much more better.
Jackass is hilarious.  No way around that fact.  As long as you're not easily offended, you'll agree.  The only stupid thing about the Jackass phenomenon are the [people] who know what the show is about, see it, and then refuse to shut up about how horrible it is.  It's like anything offensive.

Now these movies are what i would call cinematic art, but how can someone who loves films like these appreciate something like Jackass ?. I tend to think that i can enjoy something like Jackass because of man's nature to laugh at others pain and stupidity.
Jackass quite simply put is a very ummm, 'unique' piece of film in which men throw themselves at cieling fans, beat their fathers on the toilet, snort wasabi and insert toy cars in their anus.  There is just something so fresh about the whole prospect that it is so easy to just silence that little voice of reason within you and get lost in the experience. The only real problem i have with the film is the high level of male nudity but somehow i can bear it simply because of the usually outrageous outcome.
I think Jackass is a little more than just a simple gross out comedy but is rather a one fingered salute to rational thinking and society friendly behaviour. Jackass is something that is wildly entertaining and is a welcome breath of fresh air that will make you laugh, squirm, flinch and never think of matchbox cars in the sameway ever again.",1051228800,,1293,4.47457627118644

That being said I haven't watched MTV in over ten years since the channel went to hell in a handbasket. I had heard of the show Jackass, but never bothered watching. Since it was on MTV, I could only guess it was either a half hour or hour of more MTV stupidity.
Well I rented the movie on a goof and was in total disbelief. Don't get me wrong, I was on the floor rolling with laughter and howling at these idiots. I mean c'mon, this is the lowest common denominator for entertainment. Paper cuts between the toes, shooting bottle rockets from their butts, and beating a fat naked man on the toilet.
The golf blowhorn was a hoot as was the Japanese Panda Anarchy. The last straw was the lubed Hotwheels in the anus though. Thank God that's where the movie ended. I had had enough at that point. Attempted oral sex with whale sharks is one thing, but an X-ray of your butt cavity as a toy box is beyond relief.

1829799,5,B00008972B,"OK, if you're bracing for me to claim that ""Jackass"" belongs in the company of ""Schindler's List"" or ""Godfather,"" you can relax...But this movie--and the show that led up to it--is far more important and meaningful than its surface would indicate.
First off:  The surface.  ""Jackass: The Movie"" is around 90 minutes of bathroom humor and self-mutilating stunts and pranks as pulled by Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, and friends in the homoerotic style of frat-house hazing.  It's like the TV show but bolder and better produced.  Many of the guys show off their very ordinary bodies in thongs and jockstraps.  And the film is funny.  Really funny.  The kind of belly laughs that only come from being shocked as well as amused.  Our band of buddies eat snowcones soaked in ..., wreck a golf cart, snort wabasi (horseradish sauce), scorch their hams launching bottle rockets from their anuses, allow a baby alligator to bite down on a nipple, and [use a] store's display toilet.
But just beneath all that is a remark on the inaccessibility of manhood and spirituality in modern times.  If you tune out the laughter and high-wattage smiles, ""Jackass"" plays like ""The Lives of the Saints"":  a series of inventive tortures, a sequence of iconic poses by ""martyrs"" bathed in body fluids and contorted in pain.  Knoxville even apes crucifixion on a ""Rolling Stone"" cover.  Other times we see his body, like St. Sebastian's, quilled with arrows or darts.  When it's pelted with objects, we recall the stoning of St. Stephen.  Mutilating the body as a path to spiritual focus has a long Christian history, which ""Jackass"" gleefully pulls out of context, making shallow fun of it while mourning the loss of its depth.
Then there's the references to manhood rites and macho heroes:  Eating multiple boiled eggs then throwing them up (a failed Cool Hand Luke), losing badly to a much better boxer, never seeming to have a chance (a failed Rocky), running scared from a bullfight (a failed Ernest Hemingway), etc.  Knoxville and crew fail enjoyably, though; theirs is a kind of campy masculinity, an acknowledgement that the modern world has forced off the mask of machismo that once lionized and protected men.  All guys are wussies now, so Steve-O might as well skate onto thin ice in a lacy ballerina outfit.
""Jackass,"" then, is a kind of nihilism, a male bonding without a higher purpose which uses the sugar of hilarity, camraderie, and camp to help down the hatch a bitter message about a time without real he-men or holy men.  The audience may be too busy guffawing to notice that this sadomasochistic sit-com is revved up by a nonchalant homoeroticism and a breezy iconoclasm or that its characters' laughs are sometimes a bit forced or nervous.
The week ""Jackass"" came out in theaters, I took a trio of 15yo boys to see it (its target audience whether anyone admits it or not), and one of them complained afterward that Steve-O wasn't as manly as Bam because he refused to suffer a matchbox car up the ....

Something that sets this apart from other comedies is this is actually happening, these aren't actors, this is real life stuff.
All in all, if you like the show, you will love the movie. The opening scene has to be one of the greatest openings for any movie of all time, and it really sets the tone for how great the movie is. I won't spoil anything, but ""Burglars"", ""Golf Course Air Horn"", and ""Hardware Poop (I think that's what it's called)"", are some of the best. My only complaints with the movie is that it could've been longer, and they could've cut down on the male nudity, which I think we can all agree, there was a little too much of.
Overall, I don't see how I can complain about anything in this movie because I have never laughed so hard in the theater in my life. You will react to everything that they do, eveytime they fall, you will feel it. This is one of the movies that will make all old people say ""damn teenagers"" over and over in their heads. And it will make airhorns fly off the shelves, but hopefully Toy Car sales won't increase (Watch the movie). A hilarious movie, and we can only hope for a part 2.
Now, the DVD, which I expected to be short of spectacular, was actually very good. It has around 30 minutes of bonus footage, which nearly all of it is all new stuff cut from the movie. If you think the movie is too short, this really fills in the whole time problem. Not only does the DVD have alot of new funny material, but it has TV spots, Music videos, Outtakes, ""Making of the Movie"" from MTV, and a lot more. And  yes, it contains even more male nudity! AAHH!
The movie is like nothing we've seen before at the theater, it's hilarious, and the DVD is jam packed with extras, including about 30 minutes of brand new footage. You cannot go wrong with this DVD purchase, if you don't laugh at some of this stuff, you need to start enjoying yourself more.

You get to see Bam pick on his parents some more and make his Mom say a certain word, Steve-O being Steve-O, some of Party boy in Japan, and Johnny get shot with a riot control device. Also, there are some special guest appearences that you will not believe. The pranks do not stop there and go as far as you are probably thinking they can go. When the movie is over you need to check out the outtakes and the bonus footage, they are great as well.
If you are looking for a movie where you do not have to follow closely, want to laugh your rear off, and just see some entertaining stuff, GET THIS MOVIE NOW!",1050278400,3,971,3.9846153846153847

I bought the DVD a few days ago and watched the movie again, unlike most movies, I could watch this movie a billion times and it would still be great. Favorite skits include ""the shoplifter"", ""the gong"", ""golf course airhorn"", and ""golf cart antics"". The extra features are awesome too. There's 27 minutes of extra footage, some of which are funnier than some of the skits in the movie. There's outakes, a making of, and commentary by the directer, cinematographer and Johnny Knoxville, and another by the rest of the cast. Buy this movie.",1050019200,,691,4.448818897637795

I bought the DVD because it was so funny however it's not one of those movies you can watch all the time or with everyone. There are quite a few gross parts (ie: a fat mans ..., vomiting....) The DVD is packed with more stunts that weren't in the movie, music videos (but not good ones), and a few other small things.
Bottomline: It's definately a funny movie. If you are a boy between 14 (wouldn't recommend it for younger kids) and 25 you will LOVE jackass. If you are just a person who enjoys watching people hurt themselves and make fools of themselves you will laugh your ... off. However if you find that immature it's not a movie you will like. Knoxville and his crew do a good job of doing dumb stuff but still being funny not just dumb.",1049846400,2,893,4.167630057803469
1829806,4,B00008972B,"Call it Truth in Advertising. Nobody who sees this movie can claim they weren't forewarned as to the content. This is humor reduced to its most crude and basic level as a gang of complete jackasses resort to a series of stunts, gags, and practical jokes that accept no bounds when it comes to bad taste in pursuit of a laugh. A typical scene is one where two of the Jackasses find new ways to play with bottle rockets. One, wearing only a thong, inserts the stick end into his rear (this distinction being worth pointing out inasmuch as, with this crew, it's entirely conceivable for them to insert it to fire in the opposite direction) and lights the fuse while the other stands waiting nearby, the rocket tied to his, uh, member with some dental floss. Needless to say, you won't see stuff like this on PBS, and if your tastes in humor run more toward Woody Allen or Garrison Keillor, you might want to give this movie a pass.
As for the rest of us, it's really a question of how high your threshold for watching humiliating, disgusting, or painful behavior happens to be. My own reaction was mixed. Some of it was too much, most notably the Yellow Snow Cone and the Hardware Store Toilet scenes, the latter was so gross that the cameraman started barfing (all dutifully recorded on film, of course). Others, like the Riot Gun Ammo and Paper Cut scenes, seemed to ""celebrate"" the ability to withstand pain as opposed to actually being funny. Some struck me as just dumb, including most of the Japan footage. Still, there was plenty of good stuff, my favorites being the Golf Course Air Horn, the Alligator in the House, and Tropical Pole Vaulting. Some stuff, like Waking up Dad at 1 AM with a barrel of exploding firecrackers, then doing a repeat a few hours later in his van as he's about to leave for work, succeeds by virtue, not of cleverness but sheer, mindless audacity and others, like a five second shot concerning a Jackass, a mini-trampoline and a ceiling fan, work because they're completely unexpected. It must also be noted that the DVD offers up real value, both in the form of deleted scenes, many of which are better than the ones that were left in, and in the two accompanying commentary tracks featuring the filmmakers and the Jackasses themselves. The bottom line is this movie is all about reveling in pure mayhem and wretched excess, so don't look for any Oscar worthy acting or direction, since the only awards these guys are likely to qualify for are the Darwin Awards.

Jackass the movie is really a split down the middle.  You either love it or hate it.  I found the movie was as funny if not funnier than the show, (although the cky video's are even funnier).  With stunts like the rent-a-car smash up derbie, and the golf carts, it made me laugh and repulsed others.  Even the urine snow cone had it's charm, (even though it still haunts me)there is also a lot of stuff that is so outragious that you will not believe how crazy those guys are.

The MTV show was great but very limited to what they could show on national television.  The movie was a great way to let them do what they wanted.  After bringing home I popped it in and surprisingly my parents got the biggest kick out of it.  These guys went to EXTREME measures especially the stunt with the little toy car.  They practically do wjhatever pops into their head.  They can turn the simplest thing into the wackiest stunt and you will lose 10 pounds laighing so hard. I am not giving away anything from this movie you just have to see it for yourself.

1829809,4,B00008972B,"If you're already a fan of the Jackass show on MTV, then you're probably already conditioned for the content offered in this movie.  Of course, being a major motion picture, more explicit material can be shown without the censoring and it is.  If you've never watched Jackass material, then this would be a baptism by fire, so to speak.
A lot of the content in this movie is, no doubt, very hilarious and worth the look.  But, you should also be warned that some of the skits and stunts are crude or gross or tasteless, depending on your views.  I would estimate that about two-thirds of the movie is genuinely funny material that doesn't cross the line too badly.  The DVD also offers some good extra content that makes it worth while.  There are quite a few outtakes and additional stunts offered with lots of commentary also by the actors and crew.
In good faith, I cannot honestly recommend this movie to everyone because it really isn't for everyone.  But, if you're willing to give it a shot or you're a Jackass fan, then it is recommended because you're going to laugh until you hurt and you won't be disappointed.

1829810,3,B00008972B,"Let me begin by saying Jackass: The Movie was exactly what I'd expected it to be.  If you have ever seen the television program, then you probably expected the same thing I did: 3 unedited 'episodes' of Jackass pasted together, which is essentially what this film is, aside from far greater production values.
  Now let me say what most of America's youth does not want to hear: This movie is not for children.  In fact, to be quite honest, as I sat horrified, (but laughing) at sick, twisted stunt after sick, twisted stunt, all I could think about was that that this movie should have recieved an 'NC-17' rating instead of just an 'R.'  Not necessarily just because of the strong nudity, violence, and language, but because of the fact that there are too many children in America who will see this film unable to comprehend the border line between reality and entertainment.  I don't want to see a kid hurt himself or others, but I also don't want to see a teen walk into a hardware store and defecate into one of the display toilets.
  Still, as stupid, and as pointless as this movie is, it's entertaining, even more so than the television show.  So if you have a strong stomach, rent it.

There is a comment by Knoxville in the special features on how they ""Choose"" the film they used. Seems to have paid off, the clean crispness of the film rocks! The crue all rock and the music is great!
The uncensored insanity is as nauseating & offensive as always and then some, everything I hoped for. I was most impressed with the original cast all being there, and loved seeing Preston chase WeeMan... I NEVER get enough of that (0: And it was nice to visit Bam's parents again and see Phil & April re-thinking Bam's mental health status (and quietly in the night moving to a uncharted island) as usual!!!
I am now convinced of a long time suspicion, StevO IS indeed the sickest human on the planet, bar none. I must see his dvd's now! The just dudes nutz, just loves pain... And sports a new tattoo.

I was about an hour into the DVD when my girlfriend got home and she watched the rest of the movie with me.  Although she *was* not a huge Jackass fan, she laughed so hard at the last 20 minutes or so of the DVD that she insisted I start the DVD over so she could watch it from the beginning.
I think I laughed the hardest at their golf course antics.  But I must say that watching Party Boy dancing around that department store in Japan was an absolute riot.  Let's not forget that the look on Johnny Knoxville's face after Butterbean knocked him out in that department store was priceless.  Oh, and what about Ryan Dunn getting the x-ray?  I know I will never look at Hotwheels cars the same way again.

I really was not into Johnny Knoxville's brand of humor, but my son insisted that it was one of the funniest movies he'd ever seen.  He was right...sort of.  Some of the stunts had me laughing like I hadn't laughed since high school, while others were looked so painful or repulsive that I cringed.
I liked the rent a car demo derby sketch, the golf cart stunt was hilarious, and the part where the guys shoot bottle rockets out of their rectums was insanely funny.  On the other hand, the scene where the guy eats a yellow snow cone made in part from his own urine was something I could have done without.
As I might have expected, the reviews of this movie run the gamut from completely offended to totally loved.  One reviewer who trashed the picture made a reference to Tom Green (who is not in this picture) which makes me believe he hadn't bothered to take the time to watch the movie before panning it.  Personally I thought it was for the most part interesting and funny although it does feature some totally repulsive scenes that will offend most viewers in my age group (I'm 46).

Yep, the outrageous MTV show now has its very own movie.  ""Jackass: The Movie"" includes all of your favorite misfits as they perform some of the most outrageous, painful, and disgusting stunts ever to be caught on camera.  Join Johnny Knoxville and his gang as they do everything possible to make sure that this is the most outrageous and disgusting thing your eyes have ever seen.  I will not give away any of the stunts, for what's so great about the movie is being surprised.
There's no storyline, no plot, and no set-up.  It is what it is, and it makes no apologies.  That's why I love it so much.  I have never cringed so many times in my life!  I was laughing non-stop and my eyes were flooded with tears when it was all said and done.  Be warned, this is NOT for people who get easily offended or disgusted.  This is not for people with weak stomachs.  If you don't like anything that's distasteful, then skip this one right now.  Don't even attempt it.
If you hate the show, you will hate the movie.  THAT is a fact.  Don't even bother.  All it will do is make you angry that you wasted your time with it.  If you love the show, then you will most likely love the movie.
The DVD is outstanding, being that it is loaded with so many special features for you to play around with.  The best are the 27 additional minutes (separate feature from the movie) that were deemed to outrageous for the theatres.  It's like watching a complete Jackass episode uncensored.  Other features included are two commentary tracks, ""making-of"" feature, outtakes, trailer and promo spots, music videos and more!  The commentary tracks are hilarious and are worth checking out.  (Especially the cast commentary track.  They're rarely talking about the movie and it is more like they're just hanging out and drinking!)

I did have a few good-hardy laughs in watching this DVD. And I found myself laughing at some of the most perverted stunts.  The toy car in the condom in the man's rectum, the naked men wearing the fishnet underwear full of shrimp.  Even more hilarious are the outtakes and additional footage.  Two stunts I thought were horrible to watch was the guy relieving himself of solid waste in the car and in the hardware store demo toilet and the stunt of waking up the parents with fireworks. Scrapping the electric razor on someone's scalp was too cruel.  I like the midget.  My favorite additional footage  skit is the sand [...] and the electrical shock to the scrotum.

1829829,3,B00008972B,"""Jackass: The Movie"", based on the popular MTV series, heralds a new high in lowbrow comedy. Opinion on it is wildly divergent. Looking at its ratings by users of the Internet Movie DataBase [imdb.com], we find that 28.5% of the voters give it the highest rating but 14.2% give it the lowest. Viewers under eighteen tend to like it, but ratings plummet the higher the age group. If you are over thirty, this probably isn't for you.
This isn't a movie in the conventional sense. There is no plot, and it isn't exactly a documentary, although sociologists in the future will certainly use it as a reference point when examining our times. It's a series of dumb skits performed by a group of twentysomething madmen whose journey to maturity is decidedly on the slow side. The skits range from the outrageously funny to the even more outrageous... . It's this compulsion ... to shock the audience which eventually overwhelms those scenes that are pure comic genius.
In a way there's nothing surprising about ""Jackass"". For decades in America, each generation has had great fun in shocking the generation before it. The real question the children of MTV must ask themselves is not how shocking they can be to their parents, but how shocking their children will be to them.

Therefore, I decided to check out the movie which is just an extended version of the tv show, but with alot of swearing and male nudity. I was a bit disappointed. For one thing, 90 minutes of the stunts get to be too much, I don't really need to see Steve-o bare bottom in almost every stunt he pulls, and some of them were just kind of dumb. I did laugh out loud quite a few times. My favorites are the alligator in Brams moms kitchen. She deserves her own show! The stunt where one of the guys puts a toy truck up his butt and goes to a doctor for an x-ray, and I loved the old man stunts. They cracked me up. Everything else is nothing new which is the main problem. They are variations on stunts shown on the tv show, so we have seen most of them already, either in the show, or in the trailer. The outakes and extra footage are great, so I recommend the dvd for that, but I wish there had been a lot more original stunts instead of the same ones we have seen over and over again, and enough with the naked Stev-O!",1048204800,,1173,4.03862660944206
1829846,4,B00008972B,"Okay, so if you don't like Jack Ass style humor, you won't like Jack Ass The Movie. Don't blame the youth of today, or the degradation of entertainment or society. That's missing the point here.
I can testify to this. I'm a college student, 24 years old, already have a full time job, and I'm going to graduate with honors in June. Intelligence has nothing to do with liking this kind of humor. Larry, Curly, and Moe were once considered renegade comedians because they were what we now call slap stick. How intelligent were there skits? Did they convey some quality truth and meaning? I didn't think so.
Jack Ass is something to accept at face value. It's impromptu reality comedy at it's finest and possibly most outrageous(although I've seen worse). If you enjoy seeing outrageous people perform outrageous comedic stunts, Jack Ass the movie is for you. Unlike their shows, they actually had a nice budget to play with. Which leads to some incredible scenes. I don't normally watch the show often, but the movie was the funniest two hours of comedy I've ever seen.
There are some scenes that are pretty gross and can offend some people. If you are squeemish about taboo subjects and scenes or honestly don't find any value in neo-slap stick humor, stay away. They are many scenes involving taboo subjects such as human excrement, urination, massochism, and sadism. If you've seen Jack Ass before, you know what I'm talking about. Difference is, this is uncensored. Clearly, this movie isn't for the timid. I think the fact that Jack Ass The Movie dwelled so much on these scenes is the reason I docked it a star. It really distracts from the funnier impromptu stunts that really shows off their creativity.
As a side note to the naysayers, don't criticize the people who like this style of comedy. I respect your decision to be a stick in the mud and you should respect other people's appreciation of this nutty humor. I'm sure Jack Ass bothers you the same way all the Reds fans bother me here in Cincinnati since I'm an Indian's fan and originally from Cleveland. I don't call these fans dumb or uncultured. It's a tough neighborhood to be in though isn't it? It's a matter of personal taste, not intelligence. You can write negative reviews of the people who like this movie till you're fingers bleed, it won't change anyone's sense of humor.",1048118400,6,2348,4.7153284671532845
1829847,5,B00008972B,"""Jackass"" the TV show should be on every station of every television in the entire world, 24 hours a day, every single day for five years. ""Jackass"" the movie should be the only film in theaters for the same amount of time.
Why, you ask? I'm not much of a fan of the exploits of the ""Jackass"" hooligans, though I'll admit to laughing out loud numerous times during this film (it takes the term ""guilty pleasure"" to whole new levels). Nay, the reason behind the five star rating lies not in the aesthetic value of the film.
""Jackass"" is proof that in our PC world of opportunity and presumed equality, Mother Nature's harsh law of ""survival of the fittest"" still prevails. It is sheer testament of her power.
You see, any imitation of the stunts performed in the show or this film is merely Nature's way of weeding out the less cognitively endowed. Johnny Knoxville and his accomplices are prophets, disciples, if you will, of Mother Nature and her ancient will to seperate the stupid from the astoundingly stupid, who include those certain individuals who lack the most rudimentary sense of moral direction in order to, for example, not set oneself aflame.
In other words, the gene pool needs a lifeguard. ""Jackass"" is that lifeguard.

It ends in a giant crash into a wall(when I was in the theater seeing this movie the whole place errupted with lauphter at the crash)A couple more stunts in the movie involved ALLIGATOR TIGHT-ROPING with Steve-O getting chicken stuffed in his jock-strap, and alligators biting it right out! Then there was (my favorite of the movie) the HORN at the golf course! Every time a person tried to take a swing, Bam Margera and Johnny Knoxville honked the Horn. The golfers didn't take it too well and chucked their clubs, and even swung a ball or two at the so-called JACKASSES. You can also look forward to seeing the NIGHT PANDAS, ROCKET ROLLERBLADES, EXTREME GOLF CARTS, THE RENTAL CAR, THE SHOTGUN, BOWLING, Dave England taking a dump in a toilete at the store, that was for sale, THE ANAL TOY CAR, and of course...WEE-MAN kicking himself in the head!

3.5 out of 4
There is little doubt that Jackass the Movie will have some of the most mixed reactions of any film in recent memory.  Some may even claim that it is one of the worst theatrical releases of all time; a pointless parade of bizarre antics no better than trash talk shows or adolescent home movies.  True, there is hardy a hint or artistry or good craftsmanship in this movie.  Picking up where the television show left off, Jackass the Movie is a crudely directed series of short stunts and gags that are often dangerous and quite disgusting.  Purists will wonder what the hell is going with American film when something like this gets the backing of a major studio.
 As usual, the purists will have missed the point.  First of all, the raw stupidity portrayed in Jackass has been hilarious since the dawn of man.  Is there any doubt that Shakespeare got a good laugh when he witnessed someone hurting themselves a wee bit as the result of their own stupidity?  Second, many of the stunts and gags performed by the crew of Jackass (led by American Hero Johnny Knoxville) are nothing if not highly innovative.  When Knoxville, for instance, boxes the legendary freestyle boxer Butterbean in a department store, and loses miserably, the camera pannes to stunned onlookers.  Equally stunned will be the audiences for this film.  Why would a skinny man with no fighting experience want to fight a monster like Butterbean?  For our entertainment, folks.  Innovative scenes like this give the folks their money's worth; the film never gets dull.
 Ultimately, however, what makes this film so memorable is that it is a celebration of friendship and good times.  The fun and laughter caught on this film rubs off on the audience.  What does this film teach us?  1) Stupidity hurts a lot, and these stunts should not be imitated.  2) Life is too short to be taken too seriously.
