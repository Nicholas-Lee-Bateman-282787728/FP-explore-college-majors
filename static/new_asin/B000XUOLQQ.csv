3008974,1,B000XUOLQQ,"Ok...am I watching another movie than what the previous reviewers watched!  This was horrible!!  I grew up in Dorchester....next door to Southie and believe me it isn't even close to what this movie portrays it to be.

And the acting or possibly the director is horrible...I mean in one scene the older brother throws food in his father's face and for a minute it looks like the father and the rest of the family are going to start laughing.  Come on this isn't real....then the father goes after his son. In real life...not even close.  The whole family didn't seem real. The acting was lame and the script had too many cliches.  I will say that the accent is about right but other than that....NOTHING.

Also since when is Southie deserted...I saw so many scenes where no one is around.  It tries way too hard to be something it's not.  Then again, is it a deep dark gritty street movie or a dark comedy?

If you want to see a movie that captures Southie...then see ""Southie""...with Donnie Wahlberg.  Solid movie and the real Southie.  Or how about ""Gone Baby Gone"" (filmed in Dorchester)simply incredible.

So pass on this one...now if I could only get my $24 back.",1212105600,10,1168,4.584541062801932

3008976,5,B000XUOLQQ,"BLACK IRISH is one of those little Independent films that manage to give more to the audience than the extreme constrictions of time and budget would suggest.  Writer/director Brad Gunn (his first film) manages to tell a story about an Irish family from South Boston that is sincere, realistic, poignant, and profound, and though he worked with a small budget and a shooting schedule of 22 days, he has produced a fine little gem of a film.

The McKay family has problems: father Desmond (Brendan Glesson) lacks work and spends most of his time drinking beer and watching baseball on TV, having been a promising baseball player as a youngster but nipped by the Vietnam War into glum lethargy; mother Margaret (Melissa Leo) resents the shadow of the man she married and works as a social worker to support her family; daughter Kathleen (Emily VanKamp) is pregnant, unwed, and when denied the choice of abortion by her mother's strong Catholicism is determined to have the child by herself, giving it the loving home she feels she has been denied; son Terry (Tom Guiry) is a tortured delinquent who is a gang member and always in conflict with the law; and youngest son Cole (the excellent young 20-year-old Michael Angarano of 'One Last Thing', 'Man in the Chair', 'Snow Angels', 'Lords of Dogtown', 'Seabiscuit',  etc) is conflicted by wanting to be a priest versus wanting to be a professional baseball player - he is the good kid and the last hope of his parents.

Terry tricks Cole into accompanying a house break-in and the trouble begins. The financial crisis at home drives Cole to get a job in a restaurant, and drives Desmond to menial work shining shoes.  The family will support Kathleen's pregnancy, but that strips the income to the point that Cole must leave his Catholic school to be in public school, and while that seems to dash his hopes for a career in baseball, the coach at his public school (Finn Curtin) acknowledges Cole's talent and promises a future.  Terry's lifestyle as a hoodlum presents increasing problems and at one point Cole gathers the courage to confront Terry during a robbery plot at Cole's work place and Terry is seriously wounded. We discover a hidden fact about Desmond that explains some of his sociopath behavior to his family and it is this discovery, coinciding with Terry's gunshot injury and Kathleen's tough life as an unwed working pregnant girl, that pulls the family unit back together.

If the plot sound like soap opera rest assured it is not.  This is an intensely realistic examination of a fragile Irish Catholic family striving to makes sense of a world that is increasingly chaotic.  All of the actors are excellent, but the extraordinary sensitivity and skill of young Michael Angarano make this a film to cherish. And Brad Gann is assuredly a talent to watch! Very highly recommended.  Grady Harp, January 08",1200182400,26,2869,4.836734693877551
3008997,3,B000XUOLQQ,"This is a film about family drama with a little bit of humor tossed in. The movie appears to have all the pieces of a decent film, yet afterwards, I couldn't help but think, ""Is that all there is?""

Cole (Michael Angarano) is a decent kid who attempts to lose himself in baseball. Unfortunately the family drama becomes a distraction. Mom (Melissa Leo) works for social services. Dad (Brendan Gleeson) drinks and looks for jobs in the paper. He has a secret. Terry (Tom Guiry) is the messed up older brother who has become a small time criminal. He hates his father. The sister, Kathleen (Emily VanCamp) is pregnant. She has moved out of the house. She was thinking about an abortion, but mom's guilt trip prevents it.

The film progresses slowly so there are no surprises. The family, which should have come together long ago as a family, now attempts to do it after disaster has hit.

1. There is a stereotyped White Trash Irish-American family (the mother is apparently native-born Irish).
2. They have 3 children, 2 of whom are in some state of dysfunction. The daughter is pregnant. The older brother is a thief/ dope-friend.
3. The younger boy wants to be a baseball player and is trying to hold down a job. It seems that he wants to be a baseball player at the expense of going into the priesthood.
4. The father seems to have lots of problems finding/ keeping work (and it is later found out that he is dying from some type of cancer).
5. Eventually the older brother is shot while trying to commit a robbery, and the film basically ends there.

This movie was pretty good in that it was not hackneyed (i.e., every single conflict was wrapped up at the end of the film and everybody kissed and was happy). The characters were well developed and well cast. Nor was the movie overly-dramatic. Since there weren't any really big name actors in the film, they actually did more than could be expected with what they actually had.

I could have done without the insistence of the writer that the characters be of Irish descent, but that wasn't enough to diminish the movie significantly.",1296950400,,1234,4.6255707762557075
3009001,5,B000XUOLQQ,"Wow!  Black Irish is a lost masterpiece in the world of drama films.  It's about an Irish family that moves to Boston, and while there, each of the five family members (a father, mother, two brothers and a sister) each have their own problems.  Their problems range from minor to significant, but ALWAYS constant.  This becomes apparent right from the beginning when you see that the two brothers are not exactly on the same page.

If there's one really tiny complaint, it's that the sister problems didn't get much attention in comparison to the rest of her family, but then again, her problems (without revealing anything) have been the topic of choice in several other movies.

The majority of the storyline focuses on the extremely rocky relationship between the two brothers.  One brother always appears good and honest, while the other one is definitely a punk and a troublermaker, always picking on his younger brother and forcing him to do things he wants absolutely no part of.

The younger brother has dreams about being a baseball player.  That's what he wants more than anything else.  However, he has a really hard time convincing his parents that's what he wants, and his mother in particular thinks it's nothing more than a foolish dream.  The father however, turns out to be a big baseball fan.

The father has some pretty devastating secrets and might be the most underrated character in the film.  You really feel for him.

The drama segments are really interesting because they go through a TON of twists and turns.  It really makes you feel for this family and hope they pull through with their numerous problems.  You really become attached to each family member.  You experience anger, sadness, tension, and several other emotions as the fictional family on your TV screen goes through pretty much anything you can think of.  You never really feel happiness however.  It's a pretty depressing storyline overall.

I really like the realism aspect of the Irish family coming to America and losing a small portion of their accent.  That's usually how it happens, so that aspect of the storyline seemed pretty realistic to me.

I'm not sure if the ending is more disappointing or satisfying.  You have to see it to know what I mean.  I'm just not sure.  Maybe that's the *only* way to sum up all those horrible events so I'll cut it some slack.

Overall, Black Irish is one heck of an underrated film.  It's interesting, emotional, and written brilliantly.  I really think you'll love it.",1280534400,2,2506,4.81924882629108

3009006,5,B000XUOLQQ,"I grew up in the city of Woodside, Queens New York. The whole neighborhood was Irish Catholic and as the mother in this movie protests the daughter's decision to have an abortion and cart her away so the neighbors won't talk. This also was the Black Irish of Woodside. In the end the mother was right and therefore my mom and dad had 11 children. I used to ask her why she had so many kids and she would say, ""who would you like me to give back?"" Then she'd name my siblings from the oldest to the youngest and I'd shiver in fear of the thought of losing any of them.

  I had a tough older brother who always was getting into trouble and I was the passive one. It took the police to get him back into shape in his early teen years but since about the age of 19 he has been a fine upstanding citizen since with a wife from Woodside. In fact my other brother married her sister so it's all in the neighborhood. Since then we have all moved away from Woodside which looks like a different country now.

  Yes my dad was as stubborn as the father here. He drank every day but did what ever he could to support us. He had a fine job with Ma Bell phone company for 25 years and used to wash down the altar at St. Theresa's Church and school around the corner to help pay the tuition. He died at 52 from cancer but not before holding his first grandchild who is Afro-American/Irish and the gem of our hearts.

  I felt like I was watching my life pass by my eyes. My cousins live in Boston and they're the same as us but we didn't get to see each other as much as we wanted growing up since it was hard to bring 11 children over for the weekend.

  My friend is of Danish ancestory and he enjoyed it as much as I did. I saw his tears swell in many of the scenes. Terry was tough from lack of understanding and love and when he reached out to the Marine recruiter he was cut down again. Cole loved his whole family as much as Terry but Cole had the ability to share it, keep quiet when he knew talking would do no good but persisted in his dreams. My first job was also in a fine Italian eatery. Like another reviewer the bird scene on Cole's first date is hysterical.

  If ever there was a movie that was pitch perfect to the fact it surely is this one. I must say to another reviewer that streets are empty in a movie so the viewer can see the scenery otherwise if it was packed as I'm sure it usually is one might not know where they are.

  The police also let us get away with things that were not so much crimminal but not always upright. Of course they also were Irish Catholic too. Everyone knew everyone.

  Another great movie that's out on DVD is In Burges<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B0018BD9DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>with the father from this movie and Colin Farell. It's not in the states but it's funny as all get out. My father was born in Galway, Ireland with his thick black Irish hair and my mother's mother was from County Claire.

  Someone give that guy back his $24. I'm sorry he didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of us and I believe it's totally unfair to give it one star. But he certainly has the right to say what he thinks of it as we all have our own opinions.",1225152000,7,3256,4.231391585760518

I used to ask her why she had so many kids and she would say, ""who would you like me to give back?"" Then she'd name my siblings from the oldest to the youngest and I'd shiver in fear of the thought of losing any of them.

  I had a tough older brother who always was getting into trouble and I was the passive one. It took the police to get him back into shape in his early teen years but since about the age of 19 he has been a fine upstanding citizen since with a wife from Woodside. In fact my other brother married her sister so it's all in the neighborhood. Since then we have all moved away from Woodside which looks like a different country now.

  Yes my dad was as stubborn as the father here. He drank every day but did what ever he could to support us. He had a fine job with Ma Bell phone company for 25 years and used to wash down the altar at St. Theresa's Church and school around the corner to help pay the tuition. He died at 52 from cancer but not before holding his first grandchild who is Afro-American/Irish and the gem of our hearts.

  I felt like I was watching my life pass by my eyes. My cousins live in Boston and they're the same as us but we didn't get to see each other as much as we wanted growing up since it was hard to bring 11 children over for the weekend.

  My friend is of Danish ancestory and he enjoyed it as much as I did. I saw his tears swell in many of the scenes. Terry was tough from lack of understanding and love and when he reached out to the Marine recruiter he was cut down again. Cole loved his whole family as much as Terry but Cole had the ability to share it, keep quiet when he knew talking would do no good but persisted in his dreams. My first job was also in a fine Italian eatery. Like another reviewer the bird scene on Cole's first date is hysterical.

  If ever there was a movie that was pitch perfect to the fact it surely is this one. I must say to another reviewer that streets are empty in a movie so the viewer can see the scenery otherwise if it was packed as I'm sure it usually is one might not know where they are.

  The police also let us get away with things that were not so much crimminal but not always upright. Of course they also were Irish Catholic too. Everyone knew everyone.

  Another great movie that's out on DVD is In Burges<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B0018BD9DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>with the father from this movie and Colin Farell. It's not in the states but it's funny as all get out. My father was born in Galway, Ireland with his thick black Irish hair and my mother's mother was from County Claire.

  Someone give that guy back his $24. I'm sorry he didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of us and I believe it's totally unfair to give it one star. But he certainly has the right to say what he thinks of it as we all have our own opinions.",1225152000,7,3256,4.231391585760518
8229932,3,B000XUOLQQ,"(Minor Spoilers) In quite an unusual premise, ""Cole"" (Michael Angarano, Jack's son on ""Will and Grace"") is actually bullied by his big brother ""Terry"" (Tom Guiry, TV's ""The Black Donnellys""), who otherwise defends Cole, so you might say that Terry loves his brother but he has a funny way of showing it.  Melissa Leo (""Frozen River,"" ""The Fighter"") plays their mother ""Margaret,"" and Brendan Gleeson (""Perrier's Bounty,"" ""The Snapper"") plays their father, with the brothers' sister ""Kathleen"" played by Emily VanCamp.  Viewers should be patient because the second half definitely outshines the first half, but this film about an Irish family in Boston and Cole trying to distance himself from the inevitability of his family's not-always-positive influences definitely could have been a TV movie, with Guiry surprisingly stealing the film from the other fine performances.  Not up to Leo's usual standards of excellence (particularly not up on the same level as Leo's ""Frozen River"") but good if your expectations are slightly limited.",1487376000,,1035,5.3765432098765435

8229937,5,B000XUOLQQ,"I liked this movie when I first saw it. The acting is alright and the story is pretty thick but simple. All in all, I think I just like the fact that it focusses on a working class Irish family corrupt by the inner-city, but still pushing on, as troublesome as times and trials can be on the members. All I can speak for is my opinion, and as an Irish guy, I like this film.",1394236800,,374,3.9342105263157894
8229938,2,B000XUOLQQ,"Okay, but heavy on the Boston clichs.
Some of this is true to fact; some of this is hokey
and downright corny (the Irish lead actor lays it on too hard) -
but definitely worth seeing if you like films about Boston, Massachusetts, USA.",1391904000,,234,4.340909090909091
8229939,4,B000XUOLQQ,"This is not an original story, it seems that in recent years we have been flooded with stories that are very similar to this. It was very well done though, with an all-star cast, and a few twists in the story. Black Irish is another story about an Irish family living in Boston. Dad's an alcoholic, Mom is as strict as they come, the older brother is into crime, the older sister is facing a life changing decision, and Cole McKay (Michael Angarano) is stuck in the middle. The story chronicles a year in the life of the McKay family and features many changes that oddly happen all at once. The story wasn't anything special, but it was done in a way that wasn't as predictable as some of the other Boston family films, none of the characters are cops, and there is even some humor thrown in here and there. Being a lifelong baseball fan, that angle of Cole's life was the one I really related to and it helped the film to stand out even a little more. Oscar winner, Melissa Leo, does an amazing job and really puts the emotions into context. Everyone in the McKay family is a tough guy, they don't feel anything, and while she appears to be the strictest one of all, she's the one who really expresses the emotions that everyone must have felt. Angarano wasn't bad either, but I've seen him in things before and as usual, he lacks any kind of expression, he just always seems to go with the flow and do an adequate job, but nothing else. The big surprise of this film was seeing Tom Guiry, A.K.A. Smalls from the Sandlot as a tough, Boston-area, criminal. Seeing the sweet, innocent, kid I grew up know as Scotty Smalls, turn into a fowl mouthed, tough ass, drug dealer was pretty funny. Overall, Black Irish isn't a bad film, it's entertaining and it's unpredictable. There are a lot of different angles and the film moves quickly through the story, but the performances were a mixed bag, and a lot of aspects seemed to mirror similar films. If you don't watch a lot of movies, you'll love this film, but if you're a fanatic and you watch this, you'll probably be able to easily list a dozen films that are very similar.",1374537600,2,2122,4.415816326530612
8229940,5,B000XUOLQQ,Black Irish movie shows the disfunction that exist within a family among each member. Yet in the end the family structure must not loose it's foundation of love even when going through challenges. In the end Love must be supported and strengthen even in crisis situation. This movie speaks to this foundation.,1361059200,,309,4.961538461538462
8229941,3,B000XUOLQQ,"This is a film about family drama with a little bit of humor tossed in. The movie appears to have all the pieces of a decent film, yet afterwards, I couldn't help but think, ""Is that all there is?""

Cole (Michael Angarano) is a decent kid who attempts to lose himself in baseball. Unfortunately the family drama becomes a distraction. Mom (Melissa Leo) works for social services. Dad (Brendan Gleeson) drinks and looks for jobs in the paper. He has a secret. Terry (Tom Guiry) is the messed up older brother who has become a small time criminal. He hates his father. The sister, Kathleen (Emily VanCamp) is pregnant. She has moved out of the house. She was thinking about an abortion, but mom's guilt trip prevents it.

The film progresses slowly so there are no surprises. The family, which should have come together long ago as a family, now attempts to do it after disaster has hit. The title, ""Black Irish""  didn't play into the film very well. This could have been anybody's family. I did not like this odd family film as much as ""Another Happy Day.""
