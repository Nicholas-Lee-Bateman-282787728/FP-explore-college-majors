8227565,2,B000X9YE96,The first episode was in perfect english subbing but then the subbing for the rest of the episodes were really bad. If I hadn't watched this drama a million times before I wouldn't have know what they were talking about. On time delivery though.,1230768000,,245,4.590909090909091

8227567,3,B000X9YE96,"So ordering this product on amazon.com in english you would think that this dvd MENU would be in English or at the least in Korean because it is a KOREAN drama. But apparently when you pop in the DVD, everything is in Chinese and you have to figure out how to play the DVD from a completely chinese menu. Cmon, its a KOREAN drama, the menu should be in korean at the very least, or have the option at the very beginning of the dvd allow you to select which language you would like, how you can select wide screen or not. But China being a 2 Billion size population, i guess there is more of a market for korean drama's in china than america or even possibly korea.

So that my only complaint, the DVD's came really fast in the mail. And the story ain't half bad either.",1218067200,,769,4.1610738255033555
