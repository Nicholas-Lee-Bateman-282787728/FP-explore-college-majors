3154592,5,B0016A0T7W,"We all are seeking ways to heal our bodies, and yoga is a beautiful friend that can help us discover ways to make it happen.  Even if you are in good health, yoga will still surprise you in how much you feel more alive, and energetic!  Having someone that can guide you and help you to connect with yoga is what Maral does so great!  She is your teacher and your friend!  Her poses inspire you to open yourself to the idea of ""YES, I CAN!""  Her knowledge has been built from years of helping students.  I am very fortunate that I have taken her classes.  Having chronic asthma for so many years and taking strong medication, it was until I found her that I was able to begin to heal!

She will inspire you, help you, and guide you to truely experience the gift of yoga that will forever be part of your life!",1207353600,2,808,4.167741935483871
3154593,4,B0016A0T7W,"Very useful video, shows beginner and intermediate stances. If I don't have the time/money/energy to go out to a yoga studio, this works great as a back up.",1445817600,,156,4.607142857142857
3154594,1,B0016A0T7W,Very advanced.,1442534400,,14,6.5
3154595,1,B0016A0T7W,too much repetition for me. i tend to lose interest after repeating a set more than 3 times. i wish the audio was clearer and more articulate. i like the kind of explanations or voice overs where i don't have to look up at the television to understand the placement of body parts or what positions to do next.,1433548800,,309,4.254237288135593
3154596,4,B0016A0T7W,"Great setting, great talent. If you haven't taken a lot of yoga, this isn't for you as the pose tips and corrections aren't always clear. Also, can we PLEASE have a yoga DVD without so much spiritual chatter? I want to focus on the pose and my breathing, not a talk therapy session, while I'm doing yoga. But I may buy this after renting because the flow is excellent, it's challenging but with great adaptations while I'm working into poses.",1429920000,,442,4.5375
3154597,5,B0016A0T7W,"I have a solid 15 year yoga background, practicing from the broad spectrum of hatha yoga to Iyengar specific training, to Bikrim to Ashtanga and others.  I have historically been disappointed in yoga DVD's, as they typically do not cover as much of the poses as you would experience in a class - especially a general hatha style session. Usually I would end up adding my own poses as needed or would just skip them altogether and do my own thing. This dvd however, took me by surprise in a very great way!  I had not been practicing yoga on a regular basis for a couple of years and, when revisiting it a short while ago realized that I am really in need of some of the basic, foundational flows and poses I was used to in a general hatha yoga session.  After reading the reviews I decided to *rent* this one and, after one try I will surely be purchasing it.  I agree with some of the other reviews in that 70 minutes may seem long, however many traditional yoga sessions tend to run about this length, so on the positive side please know you are getting about as authentic of an experience without attending an actual class!

On that note I would suggest folks have some experience with these poses before jumping in - it was helpful for me to already have some knowledge of the tiny nuances of each pose as to not become frustrated with those which I may not be able to fully execute, so I could see someone getting flustered if not aware of the variations and modifications available!",1419724800,6,1488,4.3963636363636365
3154598,5,B0016A0T7W,"This might be the best workout video I've ever had.  I've been doing it at least once a week for several years now.  I love the feature that allows you to turn off the instruction and just hear the pose cues, so once you have it down, you don't have to hear the same thing over and over (more vidoes should have this feature).  I'd consider myself an intermediate yoga practitioner--I've been doing yoga for about 10 years but never pushed it to an advanced level.  I've taken many classes and done many videos, but this is the only video that gives me that simultaneous worked out/stretched out feeling that I get from a good class.  I only do the first hour or so--the active portion--and then do some of my own stretches at the end.  The passive, stretching portion of the workout is fine, just usually beyond my attention span.",1414022400,,831,4.470198675496689
3154599,5,B0016A0T7W,"This is a great yoga dvd.  Not exactly for beginners, as It's long and tough.  But if that's what you want. Here it is!  Love it!",1411257600,,129,3.8846153846153846
3154600,5,B0016A0T7W,I love this yoga practice! I just recently brought it with me on a weekend camping trip. I downloaded it onto my kindle I was a little worried I would have to turn my head in the middle of a pose to see what I was suppose to do next but the instructor is very detailed and I barley had to peek at my kindle to see what to do for the next pose. One of the best yoga dvds Ive seen.,1407024000,,379,3.6341463414634148
3154601,5,B0016A0T7W,A great video for those that already know yoga and want to advance their poses.,1405987200,,79,4.333333333333333

3154604,4,B0016A0T7W,"Perfect for Intermediate to Low Level Advanced Yoga Practitioners. Perfect for those looking to truly explore postures and get the greatest benefit from each. Instruction is acceptable, verbal guidance could be a little more in step with the movements. Overall a Very Good and energizing Yoga workout with smooth meditation in action.",1401321600,,334,5.4423076923076925
3154605,5,B0016A0T7W,"I been practicing Vinyasa Flow Yoga for 6-7 months now(3 times a week) and classes are expensive for me (I'm a student). I'm not a beginner but I'm not advanced yet. This is definitely not for beginners and if you been practicing yoga please note this is VINYASA, there are a lot if different types of yoga. There are some inversions like bird of paradise, headstand, crow, yoga split, mermaid....You do chaturanga several times. I love it bc its very similar to my class and a lot cheaper!!!!!! Cant wait to finally master this! I highly recommend it!",1397606400,3,552,4.642857142857143
3154606,4,B0016A0T7W,I enjoyed a variety of poses with this DVD. I recommend those who are familiar with practicing Yoga from intermediate to Advance.,1395792000,,129,4.909090909090909
3154607,4,B0016A0T7W,I was out of town and out of my groove.  There were no studios in the town that I was in and I was sort of frantically searching for the next best thing... This really was the next best thing for me because it was similar to the style at my current studio.  It's easy to follow IF you know the pose by both names.  I would think that if you're still a green beginner that this may not be the video for you.  It's a little faster flow than what I'm used to but it was overall nice and I loved that there were arm balances! I would recommend this to any of my fellow classmates or other intermediate yogis,1392595200,,603,3.958677685950413
3154608,4,B0016A0T7W,"I say rent this to see if you like it, but if you're at an intermediate Yoga level, and like a flowing yoga class with really decent music, and pretty good quality video, then you'll probably want to add this to your collection. I was pleasantly surprised to find the teacher not annoying, the music is good traditional/modern yoga music and chants, she covers a wide range of asanas, and shows different positions for different flexibility levels. I especially like the inclusion of the bird of paradise and headstand poses. It's a pretty good workout too-",1390176000,,557,4.8125
3154609,5,B0016A0T7W,"I like everything about this video!
It's not for beginners, but my husband got through it, and he hasn't practiced much.
The flow and instructions are excellent. She talks you through each movement, and even offers alternatives for many moves., which keeps you challenged and keeps the video fresh.
She works every part of the body.
The scenery and music are great.
I highly recommend.",1390176000,,385,4.938461538461539

3154611,3,B0016A0T7W,"I gave this three stars not because its not good but because I realized that I am not at this level of instruction yet.  The rhythm and pace of this video is a bit fast and I realized that I needed to step back and reassess the type video I really needed.  On the other hand, if you are truly at that intermediate level this video will most likely meet your needs.",1385078400,,364,4.041666666666667
3154612,4,B0016A0T7W,"I started off with the Ali McGraw yoga DVD years ago, and while I like it, it was time to change things up and advance a bit. Maral Hadidi definitely knows her stuff, and despite my great balance and flexibility, she was really challenging. I couldn't do everything on the first try (hello, headstands!), but the workout was long enough and enjoyable enough to come back to again. The scenery is lovely, too.",1381881600,,408,4.602739726027397
3154613,5,B0016A0T7W,"I have been doing yoga for four years and have over 50 yoga DVDs. This is my absolute favorite. It just flows from one pose to the next and we do poses that are creative and deep stretching and, best for me, can be made harder and harder. So trees tons of room for improvement too. It's challenging and you can grow with it.",1381190400,,324,4.078125
3154614,5,B0016A0T7W,"This is hands down the best yoga video.  It was like being in a class. I lived in Manhattan for 17 years, and now live in the country.  I have been looking for a yoga experience that was similar to bing I a class...now I found it.",1381190400,,230,3.872340425531915
3154615,5,B0016A0T7W,"This is a great flow. I usually do Shiva Raw's DVDs because I like the matrix of picking and choosing my workout, but this is a great workout.",1381104000,,142,4.107142857142857
3154616,3,B0016A0T7W,"I enjoyed this video, though the voice is very quiet. The narrating also does not match the moves, so you have to choose to follow either the narrator or the ladies who are performing the moves. They also don't show too many alternative positions. I'm not advanced in yoga, so that probably didn't help, but it would have been nice to see more modifications - they have some, but not many.

I'd definitely suggest this for anyone who is at an advanced yoga level - it was a bit too challenging for me, but I learned a lot of new positions and felt good after.",1372550400,,559,4.3238095238095235

I found this dvd to, yes, be intermediate, easy to follow yet quite the workout. I can't do all of the binds that they do but I will be doing this dvd more (probably putting the power yoga dvd on the backburner for a while).
I am very happy with this purchase.",1371168000,,529,4.145631067961165
3154618,4,B0016A0T7W,"Was very excited when I got the dvd but was disappointed with the slow pace of the asanas. Given that it was a sunk cost I tried it again when I was calmer and wanted a more soothing practice. While she doesnt get you panting and sweating the practice covers several variations and is sequenced well. What i didn't like is that she does not give cues for intermediate poses ie headstand where gradual baby steps lead to being able to do it finally. She does give instructions on how to switch between poses but i prefer the more upbeat gym style instuctors like Kathy Mcgee and Jillian Michels

All in all a wholesome practice for the serious yogis but a little disappointing from a heavy workout perspective",1365984000,,708,4.53125
3154619,4,B0016A0T7W,"I am a beginner/intermediate for vinyasa yoga depending on if the position requires more strength (beginner) or flexibility (intermediate). I was able to follow through 30 minute of the tape before I get tired, but then I haven't done yoga in a year or so. I love the calming sound in the background. The moves are not the easiest to follow if you are not already familiar with it. Overall it's a great workout and exactly what I'm looking for... a way for me to exercise and further my yoga in the comfort of my own home whenever I have the time for it.",1360886400,,554,4.336538461538462

3154621,1,B0016A0T7W,"I purchased this as an Amazon instant video for $9.  What a waste of time and money.  The video was blurry which is not what you expect nowadays.  Worse yet, it kept stopping and starting which made it completely useless for vinyasa ""FLOW.""

3154622,5,B0016A0T7W,"I have been doing yoga since 2005. I love this ashtanga video. It really helps improve your practice and just strengthen you. I highly recommend this video. I do suggest to get the dvd instead of the video library. For two days now, I could not access my video library. This happens most of the time. I'm a macbookpro user. something wrong with amazon connections most of the time. wish i got the dvd instead.",1351296000,,409,4.466666666666667
3154623,3,B0016A0T7W,"I've actually ""rented"" this from Instant Video twice, the second time not realizing I'd already used it. I did like the video, but personally feel it's better suited to those times you want to take it easy. I still broke a sweat but both times I felt disappointed when there was such a long flexibility/stretch series. The first 35 minutes or so are more vigorous and I would've liked a little more of that. I would still do this video again on the days I feel like I need something a little slower and easier. The instruction is detailed and easy to follow throughout the video, without being annoying or too wordy. It's helpful that there are two models during the video, one always shows the more advanced options.",1342828800,3,717,4.565891472868217
3154624,3,B0016A0T7W,"If you practice yoga, you will realize this is not the most intermediate video out there.  It is a nice change of pace and Peggy Hall is decent but it seems a bit dated. I like the background scenery on the beaches and the surfing bits but not that challenging of a workout.",1342483200,,274,4.169811320754717
3154625,4,B0016A0T7W,"I've been practicing yoga for over 10 years, everything from Bikram to power, and in the 5 years I've sought out the most challenging classes and instructors and consider myself in the intermediate/advance group of practitioners.  However, with a 9 month daughter, my practice has taken a backseat to my daughter so I started to explore videos to continue my practice at home.  I believe with yoga, what you get out of it, is what you put into it: focus, dedication, concentration, etc., are things you can, and should be able to, achieve anywhere with proper practice, whether in a classroom, gym, studio, or your living.  That being said, the video is a good guide in achieving the main tenements of yoga.  It is long a session, not overly wrought with unnecessary commentary, the instructor's voice is smoothing, music calming (and quiet enough to allow you to play your own soundtrack if you wish).  I've done the routine multiple times and have incorporated my own variations on certain poses, while still keeping with the instructor and routine's overall flow.  The only thing missing is the 100 degree room you'd get at a studio.",1338336000,6,1136,4.860103626943006
3154626,3,B0016A0T7W,"I like the sequence, but my DVD seems to have formatting problems.  For the first few times I could choose the music and instructions, now this doesn't seem to work anymore and I can only play it with full detailled instructions and no background music.",1335916800,,253,4.622222222222222
3154627,5,B0016A0T7W,"I love to sit at home, meditate with yoga and simply relax.  When I listen to this album with the narration and light ocean waves, it takes me to a place of pure enjoyment.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys yoga and relaxing the body.",1335744000,,239,4.173913043478261
3154628,4,B0016A0T7W,"This is a solid video and a great addition to my collection. My favorite part is that someone is actually doing the modifications instead of the instuctor just briefly mentioning ""to modify, do thisthis"" but no one is actually doing it on the screen. I can't do the headstand (yet!) but it is nice to see someone in the video not doing it either so I don't feel like a complete loser. I love the stretches at the end also!",1331424000,,422,4.2875
3154629,4,B0016A0T7W,"I like this DVD for the following reasons:

-Contains a wide variety of challenging poses.

-The voice-over offers fairly detailed instruction on how to perform the poses.

-The setting is attractive and peaceful.

-There are different sound tracks available to do the practice to.

What I dislike about this DVD:

-The DVD contains one full practice that is 90 minutes long. It would be nice if it was broken down into sections that could be viewed separately if one is not up for a 90 minute practice.",1330387200,,503,4.724137931034483

3154631,5,B0016A0T7W,"This is one of my favorite yoga DVDs.  I really like the style of Maral Hadidi, and I think she provides a good level of detailed instruction and provides alternate poses.  The length is a bit longer than some DVDs - I think it is about 1 hour, 20 minutes.  This DVD is a bit more challenging than a beginner's DVD, and I still can't do the headstands, so I just do an alternate pose during this segment.  The ocean setting is very relaxing as well as the music.  I also bought Maral Hadidi's beginner DVD which I also enjoy.",1314230400,2,525,4.21
3154632,5,B0016A0T7W,"This is the only yoga video I've seen yet that offers a full workout - complete with arm balances and inversions (no handstand but you could add it), as well as modifications for people with less experience. Excellent vocal instruction with detailed alignment tips and encouragement. It's along the lines of a very good class in a studio. Bravo!",1311292800,3,345,4.864406779661017
3154633,5,B0016A0T7W,I have actually not been able to complete the whole workout.  It is that tough.  This is what I wanted.

3154634,5,B0016A0T7W,I just received this video this week and already it's my favorite! I just moved cities and have been looking for a class like the one I formerly went to in my old city but it's been tough. This is a great alternative to a yoga studio without the cost! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a tougher workout. Sometimes I just never get much out of a beginner dvd or even a power yoga video. I will definitely keep this at the top of my collection! :),1302134400,,457,4.088888888888889
3154635,5,B0016A0T7W,"The Vinyasa flow yoga dvd was easy to follow, graceful and what I needed to keep me practicing while my yoga tutor was on holiday.

I felt the yoga teacher explained the poses really well which made the dvd easy to follow.  The setting is lovely, I also live by the sea in Cyprus so identified with this immediately.",1280102400,,316,4.338983050847458
3154636,5,B0016A0T7W,"I practiced yoga with this DVD this morning for the second time and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My favorite thing about this DVD is that it includes headstand and shoulderstand.  If I only do two poses per day, those are the two that I will do.  When I practice to most other DVDs I have to pause and do my headstand / shoulderstand practice, or add it on to the end.  In addition, I appreciate that it is headstand on forearms with a longer hold, vs many videos that only come into tripod headstand from prasarita padottonasana (spelling?).  She holds headstand for a couple minutes, which if you want to hold it longer you can just continue and back up the DVD when you are finished.

The practice included appropriate counterpose and felt very balanced.  There are two women practicing to voice over.  One woman will occasionally show the less advanced version of the pose.  A couple of times I looked at the screen and they were moving a bit ahead of the instruction, but I tend to not look at the screen too much.  I love the option to have no music, as I prefer to practice without most of the time.

The DVD description indicates that this is for intermediate and advanced students, which of course is very subjective.  Advanced yogis may feel it is easy while beginners may feel it is very advanced.  I would say that it is not for a beginner in any way as you should already have learned headstand and other advanced poses.  This DVD was described as a practice DVD and not an instructional DVD.  There is some binding in side angle pose and other non-beginner poses include bird of paradise, mermaid pose, and jump backs from bakasana (crow).  If you are a yogi that likes a fast paced sweaty practice filled with lots of arm balances and extremely advanced poses this may also not be your cup of tea.

Honestly, I think that if you are an advanced practitioner it is good to always remember to keep the beginners mind.  I feel great benefit even from the most basic beginner level practices if I am focusing on alignment and remaining present with my breath.  It doesn't always have to be the most physically challenging practice in order to feel benefit.  I find that this DVD has a balance of challenging poses and simple poses to create a perfect balance of doing and undoing.  I will be using this DVD for years to come.",1274400000,2,2331,4.489311163895487
3154637,3,B0016A0T7W,"I would say first, if you like slow Hatha yoga or power yoga, this is not for you. Vinyasa Flow is a faster pace, palates-speed type of yoga. I didn't care for it and the poses were difficult for an intermediate. I don't plan on being able to stand on my head for a pose anytime soon. There are alternate poses, but I like to be able to try everything in a video.",1270166400,,363,3.9863013698630136
3154638,4,B0016A0T7W,"I really enjoyed this video, unlike alot of people here I am going to say that I didn't find the video to be all that challenging and I know there are some people who think that 90+ minuites is a long time for yoga but I find that after 90 mins I am just getting warmed up and can easily practice yoga for 3-4 houor mrs ore.  Only thing I felt lacking was the dialog of how to build some of the posture.  If you are intermediate to advanced I would suggest getting Ashtanga Yoga with Richard Freeman because his dialog on how to build each posture is very precise and articulate.

The setting on the beach is very good, although I am familiar with the practice enough to really not pay much attention to that but the beach at sunset is very calming.

I really enjoyed the music and there are multiple tracks you can listen to each time for something different which is very nice, so you won't have to listen to the same song every time.

All in all a solid practice video for home practice.",1266624000,3,990,4.216931216931217
3154639,5,B0016A0T7W,"This is one of my favorite yoga discs. Maral is great, and her commentary is deep and interesting, peppered with mind-expanding metaphors. You have a few music choices and whether or not to have instruction. I personally find the first music choice to be fantastic.

It's a good workout, but not too hard. The more challenging aspects of this disc include a long headstand--the longest I have seen with ""arta"" (bending your legs halfway down), mermaid, full splits, long holding of crow pose, coming into bird of paradise from bound angle, full 1 footed pigeon (an intense backbend), snail, and flying fish. One reviwer thought this was a beginner disc: I don't agree. However, there a slow and easy parts including leg stretches, and long holds on sownward dog. I use this disc often, but I usually skip the easier sections. Since the running time is 90 minutes, I can clip where I want and get a good hour-long workout if I am short on time.",1264464000,3,943,4.680722891566265
3154640,5,B0016A0T7W,"I would describe myself as a fairly solid intermediate practitioner and I REALLY like this DVD.  The pace is good but the poses are held much longer than the ""power"" yoga videos I have, which I like.  With those I often feel like I don't have enough time to settle into the pose, but I do here.  Plus this practice explores several advanced poses (bird of paradise, headstand, full split) that I don't see myself being able to do anytime soon, so that gives me some things to work towards other than just building stamina.

I really like Maral Hadidi's voice and her tone and manner of speech is very soothing.  She encourages well but without falling into a western ""c'mon, push it!"" mentality which is nice.

Lots of advanced poses.  You can turn on/off instruction and change on/off musics. Emphasize in shoulder opening poses, balance poses, and hamstring/hip opening, which are great for advanced yogis.  The DVD is about 90 mins.",1247875200,4,388,4.803030303030303
3154642,5,B0016A0T7W,"I took this DVD along with me while I traveled because I wouldn't have access to a yoga class for a few months. Very worthwhile purchase. If you have been practicing yoga for at least a year, you should be ready to begin this workout. It requires knowledge about how to do basic poses and a good understanding of the breathing techniques necessary to get you through the long workout. The great thing about it is that even if you feel you are advanced, many of the poses are too difficult to get on your first try, which means you actually see yourself progressing the more you practice with this DVD. One word of caution is that doing headstands are for people with a good amount of strength and balance already, it is not like other poses that help you gain strength and balance the more you do it, even if you don't do it perfect the first time. If you don't have arm strength and are wobbling a lot in the headstand, this can severely damage your neck. Try building up to the headstand slowly by placing your head between your hands and walking your feet up so that you are basically in downward dog but with your elbows and head on the ground (Don't lift both of your feet off the ground yet). This will help you gauge how much strength you have in your arms and after a few months you may be ready for a headstand. I'm very glad I bought this DVD!!

3154643,5,B0016A0T7W,"I was hesitant to order this dvd after first reading the reviews on problems with the dvd itself. I am glad I changed my mind and ordered it. I love her instruction, the length of time for each asana and the flow of the whole practice. I had never heard of Maral and I am happy I searched Amazon for the newest intermediate/advanced yoga dvds. Worth every penny! Thank you,",1240963200,,373,4.3428571428571425
3154644,4,B0016A0T7W,"This practice was very nice , slow and calming . It's 90 minutes but the physical practice is only 70 min. since there is a 7 minute standing meditation and ujjayi at the beginning and a 13 minute shavasana! Everything is chaptered well so you can skip the standing meditation for example and shorten the practice. It wasn't so advanced as I thought , the only more advanced poses were bird of paradise which I can't do , headstand and crow that she inserted in 2 rounds of sun sal. B . The rest of the flow was pretty ""regular"" with side plank , triangle , side angle , pigeon etc. It ended with backbends and inversions. It's a very complete practice however I liked Christina Pedersen's Yoga On The Beach more since it was shorter and had a better flow IMHO , including a more challenging standing balance poses sequence and some fluidity that reminded me of Shiva Rea that was missing here for me. You also have 8 audio options - 4 music options (including no music) with full instruction and the same 4 with cuing only. Overall a nice relaxing and complete practice.",1240012800,11,1071,4.469387755102041
3154645,4,B0016A0T7W,"Took me a while to get into this one. Partly because its 90 mins and finding that sort of time is a stretch for me, and partly because bits of it move slowly. Having said that, the more I do it the more I like it, and taking your time is sometimes good. I was surprised to see that some don't think it's that advanced - I for one cannot do ""bird of paradise"" or the splits and there were several bound positions that she gave modifications for. The scenery is very nice (not that you get to watch it much). I felt very relaxed after doing it. I would have liked a couple of shorter routines as well for regular use, but I can just stop at any of several points & stretch so not a biggie really. It's a keeper for sure, and gives me something to aim for. Good to have a selection of music tracks and choose between full explanations and names of positions only.",1235088000,4,860,4.094674556213017
3154646,5,B0016A0T7W,"I just finished doing this practice this morning and all I can say is that I am exhausted. As another reviewer said this dvd is a marathon not because of the number of poses but the long holds of the poses.  It starts out with a 7 minute meditation. Next is sun salute 5x each a & b with variations on b using crow pose to jump into plank; hands clasped behind back to plank pose.  Other poses are triangle, side angle to bird of paradise, head stand, gomasana arms, pyramid pose, revolved triangle, side stick variations, downward dog flip out to half or full upward bow, pigeon variations, half split, full split, locust, bow 2x, bridge, upward facing bow 3x, happy baby, hamstring stretch, side stretch, plow, shoulder stand, plow variation.  I may have missed a pose here or there but that's what you get.  The holds are looong.

Overall  I loved this class.  There are no abs and no seated poses. Another viewer said that the poses were too advanced.  Not really, I modified when I needed to.  Use blocks or straps, do modified sun salutes.  The only time I skipped a pose was in headstand, (not my favorite as I have no desire to stand on my head).  I can't do crow so I did crow prep instead.  This dvd is definitely doable for all levels.",1230422400,36,1246,4.393013100436681
3154647,5,B0016A0T7W,"A lot of poses were too advanced for me, but Maral always shows the beginners position before moving on.  She breaks down movements very well, I can't believe how much more flexible I feel compared to my other yoga dvd's.  I'm very pleased : )",1229644800,2,243,4.377777777777778
3154648,5,B0016A0T7W,"In the interest of full disclosure, I've been practicing yoga very actively (almost every day) for the past 4 months, and in a hit-or-miss way for the past year. With that in mind, at best I can consider myself an advanced beginner. Everyting I am about to say is intended to be descriptive, not critical. I think this will be a great DVD to follow when I'm ready for it.

Which leads me to my first point... the cover doesn't lie - this is for intermediate and advanced practitioners, not beginners. Yes, I could follow along with almost all of it (even the headstand, although for some of the transitions I would have to be disassembled), but the overall issue really wasn't my flexibility. It was my endurance. Many of the poses are held for a long time with no break, and difficult poses (i.e., for beginners like me) flow into other difficult poses with no rest or vinyasa in between. By the time I was halfway through, I was exhausted, although not drenched in sweat like I am with most ""power yoga"" dvds.

Second point: I usually practice from power yoga dvds, most notably those of Rodney Yee. They're great. I also use David Swenson's ""Short Forms"" dvd a lot, and I can follow his longest workout without much issue. But, the key to those dvds is near-constant movement: pose for 5 seconds, vinyasa, pose for 5 seconds, vinyasa... Wash, rinse, repeat. Your heart really amps up, and after 45 minutes to an hour, you feel like you've been through SEAL training. (No offense to you SEALs out there - I'm just trying to illustrate a point) An hour after that, I get this weird glow that lasts almost the whole rest of the day. It rocks.

This DVD was different. Yes, I was totally wiped out, and yes my heart did get going; but like I said, it was more of an endurance challence... the metaphor I keep coming back to is, this workout is like a marathon, while Rodney and David's are long sprints. Even though those workouts last almost the same amount of time, this one left me more tired in a deeper way. And less sweaty.

There are definitely some advanced poses here, too; but you can work around that. My frustration was, once I got to a pose I couldn't do (or couldn't stay in for as long as needed), I had to advance the dvd to find the next pose that I could do, which inevitably cooled me down a bit. That's the big reason I don't recommend it for beginners. Again, though, that's not a criticism of the DVD, it's a recognition that I wasn't ready for a workout of this intensity. But I'll keep at it!",1227484800,150,2515,4.402150537634409
3154649,2,B0016A0T7W,"I was disappointed in this video for a few reasons.  It did not challenge me as an intermediate vinyasa flow student.  It was not at all difficult. If you are looking for a advanced beginner tape, you might like it.  Also, The instructor adds some interesting pronunciations to her instructions.  I have taken many yoga classes in different cities, and have several different videos.  In all but this one, the pronunciations were the same. I found that quite distracting. Shiva Rea's yoga Shakti is great, as well as Christina Pederson's Vinyasa Flow on the beach. I would recommend them instead.",1226448000,15,596,4.92
3154650,5,B0016A0T7W,"I can say I had no problem playing this DVD, and the yoga was top notch.  The instructor is extremely good, the flow is of a moderate place, and it is a lengthy practice 95 minutes.  However there is a 7 minute meditation session and 5 or so minute savasana.  The poses are well sequenced and will work you out.  This is a great DVD if you have the time, skill, and the endurance to get through it.  If you need something a little shorter I would suggest Deb Dobbins video (39, 71, 70 minute sessions) or Christine Pedersen (76 minutes 1 session).  Otherwise, you cannot go wrong with this one.",1222387200,35,594,4.306306306306307

I have historically been disappointed in yoga DVD's, as they typically do not cover as much of the poses as you would experience in a class - especially a general hatha style session. Usually I would end up adding my own poses as needed or would just skip them altogether and do my own thing. This dvd however, took me by surprise in a very great way!  I had not been practicing yoga on a regular basis for a couple of years and, when revisiting it a short while ago realized that I am really in need of some of the basic, foundational flows and poses I was used to in a general hatha yoga session.  After reading the reviews I decided to *rent* this one and, after one try I will surely be purchasing it.  I agree with some of the other reviews in that 70 minutes may seem long, however many traditional yoga sessions tend to run about this length, so on the positive side please know you are getting about as authentic of an experience without attending an actual class!

On that note I would suggest folks have some experience with these poses before jumping in - it was helpful for me to already have some knowledge of the tiny nuances of each pose as to not become frustrated with those which I may not be able to fully execute, so I could see someone getting flustered if not aware of the variations and modifications available!",1419724800,6,1488,4.3963636363636365

One of the best yoga dvds Ive seen.,1407024000,,379,3.6341463414634148

This really was the next best thing for me because it was similar to the style at my current studio.  It's easy to follow IF you know the pose by both names.  I would think that if you're still a green beginner that this may not be the video for you.  It's a little faster flow than what I'm used to but it was overall nice and I loved that there were arm balances!

I was pleasantly surprised to find the teacher not annoying, the music is good traditional/modern yoga music and chants, she covers a wide range of asanas, and shows different positions for different flexibility levels. I especially like the inclusion of the bird of paradise and headstand poses. It's a pretty good workout too-",1390176000,,557,4.8125

The narrating also does not match the moves, so you have to choose to follow either the narrator or the ladies who are performing the moves. They also don't show too many alternative positions. I'm not advanced in yoga, so that probably didn't help, but it would have been nice to see more modifications - they have some, but not many.

I'd definitely suggest this for anyone who is at an advanced yoga level - it was a bit too challenging for me, but I learned a lot of new positions and felt good after.",1372550400,,559,4.3238095238095235

Given that it was a sunk cost I tried it again when I was calmer and wanted a more soothing practice. While she doesnt get you panting and sweating the practice covers several variations and is sequenced well. What i didn't like is that she does not give cues for intermediate poses ie headstand where gradual baby steps lead to being able to do it finally. She does give instructions on how to switch between poses but i prefer the more upbeat gym style instuctors like Kathy Mcgee and Jillian Michels

I still broke a sweat but both times I felt disappointed when there was such a long flexibility/stretch series. The first 35 minutes or so are more vigorous and I would've liked a little more of that. I would still do this video again on the days I feel like I need something a little slower and easier. The instruction is detailed and easy to follow throughout the video, without being annoying or too wordy.

However, with a 9 month daughter, my practice has taken a backseat to my daughter so I started to explore videos to continue my practice at home.  I believe with yoga, what you get out of it, is what you put into it: focus, dedication, concentration, etc., are things you can, and should be able to, achieve anywhere with proper practice, whether in a classroom, gym, studio, or your living.  That being said, the video is a good guide in achieving the main tenements of yoga.  It is long a session, not overly wrought with unnecessary commentary, the instructor's voice is smoothing, music calming (and quiet enough to allow you to play your own soundtrack if you wish).  I've done the routine multiple times and have incorporated my own variations on certain poses, while still keeping with the instructor and routine's overall flow.

-There are different sound tracks available to do the practice to.

This DVD is a bit more challenging than a beginner's DVD, and I still can't do the headstands, so I just do an alternate pose during this segment.

3389133,5,B0016A0T7W,"I practiced yoga with this DVD this morning for the second time and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My favorite thing about this DVD is that it includes headstand and shoulderstand.  If I only do two poses per day, those are the two that I will do.  When I practice to most other DVDs I have to pause and do my headstand / shoulderstand practice, or add it on to the end.  In addition, I appreciate that it is headstand on forearms with a longer hold, vs many videos that only come into tripod headstand from prasarita padottonasana (spelling?).  She holds headstand for a couple minutes, which if you want to hold it longer you can just continue and back up the DVD when you are finished.

The practice included appropriate counterpose and felt very balanced.  There are two women practicing to voice over.  One woman will occasionally show the less advanced version of the pose.  A couple of times I looked at the screen and they were moving a bit ahead of the instruction, but I tend to not look at the screen too much.  I love the option to have no music, as I prefer to practice without most of the time.

The DVD description indicates that this is for intermediate and advanced students, which of course is very subjective.  Advanced yogis may feel it is easy while beginners may feel it is very advanced.  I would say that it is not for a beginner in any way as you should already have learned headstand and other advanced poses.  This DVD was described as a practice DVD and not an instructional DVD.  There is some binding in side angle pose and other non-beginner poses include bird of paradise, mermaid pose, and jump backs from bakasana (crow).  If you are a yogi that likes a fast paced sweaty practice filled with lots of arm balances and extremely advanced poses this may also not be your cup of tea.

Honestly, I think that if you are an advanced practitioner it is good to always remember to keep the beginners mind.  I feel great benefit even from the most basic beginner level practices if I am focusing on alignment and remaining present with my breath.  It doesn't always have to be the most physically challenging practice in order to feel benefit.  I find that this DVD has a balance of challenging poses and simple poses to create a perfect balance of doing and undoing.  I will be using this DVD for years to come.",1274400000,2,2331,4.489311163895487

I didn't care for it and the poses were difficult for an intermediate. I don't plan on being able to stand on my head for a pose anytime soon. There are alternate poses, but I like to be able to try everything in a video.",1270166400,,363,3.9863013698630136
3389135,4,B0016A0T7W,"I really enjoyed this video, unlike alot of people here I am going to say that I didn't find the video to be all that challenging and I know there are some people who think that 90+ minuites is a long time for yoga but I find that after 90 mins I am just getting warmed up and can easily practice yoga for 3-4 houor mrs ore.  Only thing I felt lacking was the dialog of how to build some of the posture.  If you are intermediate to advanced I would suggest getting Ashtanga Yoga with Richard Freeman because his dialog on how to build each posture is very precise and articulate.

The setting on the beach is very good, although I am familiar with the practice enough to really not pay much attention to that but the beach at sunset is very calming.

I really enjoyed the music and there are multiple tracks you can listen to each time for something different which is very nice, so you won't have to listen to the same song every time.

All in all a solid practice video for home practice.",1266624000,3,990,4.216931216931217

It's a good workout, but not too hard. The more challenging aspects of this disc include a long headstand--the longest I have seen with ""arta"" (bending your legs halfway down), mermaid, full splits, long holding of crow pose, coming into bird of paradise from bound angle, full 1 footed pigeon (an intense backbend), snail, and flying fish. One reviwer thought this was a beginner disc: I don't agree. However, there a slow and easy parts including leg stretches, and long holds on sownward dog. I use this disc often, but I usually skip the easier sections.

The pace is good but the poses are held much longer than the ""power"" yoga videos I have, which I like.  With those I often feel like I don't have enough time to settle into the pose, but I do here.  Plus this practice explores several advanced poses (bird of paradise, headstand, full split) that I don't see myself being able to do anytime soon, so that gives me some things to work towards other than just building stamina.

I really like Maral Hadidi's voice and her tone and manner of speech is very soothing.  She encourages well but without falling into a western ""c'mon, push it!"" mentality which is nice.

3389139,5,B0016A0T7W,"I took this DVD along with me while I traveled because I wouldn't have access to a yoga class for a few months. Very worthwhile purchase. If you have been practicing yoga for at least a year, you should be ready to begin this workout. It requires knowledge about how to do basic poses and a good understanding of the breathing techniques necessary to get you through the long workout. The great thing about it is that even if you feel you are advanced, many of the poses are too difficult to get on your first try, which means you actually see yourself progressing the more you practice with this DVD. One word of caution is that doing headstands are for people with a good amount of strength and balance already, it is not like other poses that help you gain strength and balance the more you do it, even if you don't do it perfect the first time. If you don't have arm strength and are wobbling a lot in the headstand, this can severely damage your neck. Try building up to the headstand slowly by placing your head between your hands and walking your feet up so that you are basically in downward dog but with your elbows and head on the ground (Don't lift both of your feet off the ground yet). This will help you gauge how much strength you have in your arms and after a few months you may be ready for a headstand. I'm very glad I bought this DVD!!

It's 90 minutes but the physical practice is only 70 min. since there is a 7 minute standing meditation and ujjayi at the beginning and a 13 minute shavasana! Everything is chaptered well so you can skip the standing meditation for example and shorten the practice. It wasn't so advanced as I thought , the only more advanced poses were bird of paradise which I can't do , headstand and crow that she inserted in 2 rounds of sun sal. B . The rest of the flow was pretty ""regular"" with side plank , triangle , side angle , pigeon etc. It ended with backbends and inversions. It's a very complete practice however I liked Christina Pedersen's Yoga On The Beach more since it was shorter and had a better flow IMHO , including a more challenging standing balance poses sequence and some fluidity that reminded me of Shiva Rea that was missing here for me. You also have 8 audio options - 4 music options (including no music) with full instruction and the same 4 with cuing only.

Having said that, the more I do it the more I like it, and taking your time is sometimes good. I was surprised to see that some don't think it's that advanced - I for one cannot do ""bird of paradise"" or the splits and there were several bound positions that she gave modifications for. The scenery is very nice (not that you get to watch it much). I felt very relaxed after doing it. I would have liked a couple of shorter routines as well for regular use, but I can just stop at any of several points & stretch so not a biggie really. It's a keeper for sure, and gives me something to aim for.

3389143,5,B0016A0T7W,"I just finished doing this practice this morning and all I can say is that I am exhausted. As another reviewer said this dvd is a marathon not because of the number of poses but the long holds of the poses.  It starts out with a 7 minute meditation. Next is sun salute 5x each a & b with variations on b using crow pose to jump into plank; hands clasped behind back to plank pose.  Other poses are triangle, side angle to bird of paradise, head stand, gomasana arms, pyramid pose, revolved triangle, side stick variations, downward dog flip out to half or full upward bow, pigeon variations, half split, full split, locust, bow 2x, bridge, upward facing bow 3x, happy baby, hamstring stretch, side stretch, plow, shoulder stand, plow variation.  I may have missed a pose here or there but that's what you get.  The holds are looong.

Overall  I loved this class.  There are no abs and no seated poses. Another viewer said that the poses were too advanced.  Not really, I modified when I needed to.  Use blocks or straps, do modified sun salutes.  The only time I skipped a pose was in headstand, (not my favorite as I have no desire to stand on my head).  I can't do crow so I did crow prep instead.  This dvd is definitely doable for all levels.",1230422400,36,1246,4.393013100436681
3389144,5,B0016A0T7W,"A lot of poses were too advanced for me, but Maral always shows the beginners position before moving on.  She breaks down movements very well, I can't believe how much more flexible I feel compared to my other yoga dvd's.  I'm very pleased : )",1229644800,2,243,4.377777777777778
3389145,5,B0016A0T7W,"In the interest of full disclosure, I've been practicing yoga very actively (almost every day) for the past 4 months, and in a hit-or-miss way for the past year. With that in mind, at best I can consider myself an advanced beginner. Everyting I am about to say is intended to be descriptive, not critical. I think this will be a great DVD to follow when I'm ready for it.

Which leads me to my first point... the cover doesn't lie - this is for intermediate and advanced practitioners, not beginners. Yes, I could follow along with almost all of it (even the headstand, although for some of the transitions I would have to be disassembled), but the overall issue really wasn't my flexibility. It was my endurance. Many of the poses are held for a long time with no break, and difficult poses (i.e., for beginners like me) flow into other difficult poses with no rest or vinyasa in between. By the time I was halfway through, I was exhausted, although not drenched in sweat like I am with most ""power yoga"" dvds.

Second point: I usually practice from power yoga dvds, most notably those of Rodney Yee. They're great. I also use David Swenson's ""Short Forms"" dvd a lot, and I can follow his longest workout without much issue. But, the key to those dvds is near-constant movement: pose for 5 seconds, vinyasa, pose for 5 seconds, vinyasa... Wash, rinse, repeat. Your heart really amps up, and after 45 minutes to an hour, you feel like you've been through SEAL training. (No offense to you SEALs out there - I'm just trying to illustrate a point) An hour after that, I get this weird glow that lasts almost the whole rest of the day. It rocks.

This DVD was different. Yes, I was totally wiped out, and yes my heart did get going; but like I said, it was more of an endurance challence... the metaphor I keep coming back to is, this workout is like a marathon, while Rodney and David's are long sprints. Even though those workouts last almost the same amount of time, this one left me more tired in a deeper way. And less sweaty.

There are definitely some advanced poses here, too; but you can work around that. My frustration was, once I got to a pose I couldn't do (or couldn't stay in for as long as needed), I had to advance the dvd to find the next pose that I could do, which inevitably cooled me down a bit. That's the big reason I don't recommend it for beginners. Again, though, that's not a criticism of the DVD, it's a recognition that I wasn't ready for a workout of this intensity. But I'll keep at it!",1227484800,150,2515,4.402150537634409
3389146,2,B0016A0T7W,"I was disappointed in this video for a few reasons.  It did not challenge me as an intermediate vinyasa flow student.  It was not at all difficult. If you are looking for a advanced beginner tape, you might like it.  Also, The instructor adds some interesting pronunciations to her instructions.  I have taken many yoga classes in different cities, and have several different videos.  In all but this one, the pronunciations were the same. I found that quite distracting. Shiva Rea's yoga Shakti is great, as well as Christina Pederson's Vinyasa Flow on the beach. I would recommend them instead.",1226448000,15,596,4.92
3389147,5,B0016A0T7W,"I can say I had no problem playing this DVD, and the yoga was top notch.  The instructor is extremely good, the flow is of a moderate place, and it is a lengthy practice 95 minutes.  However there is a 7 minute meditation session and 5 or so minute savasana.  The poses are well sequenced and will work you out.  This is a great DVD if you have the time, skill, and the endurance to get through it.  If you need something a little shorter I would suggest Deb Dobbins video (39, 71, 70 minute sessions) or Christine Pedersen (76 minutes 1 session).  Otherwise, you cannot go wrong with this one.",1222387200,35,594,4.306306306306307

~various well-crafted music selections

~filmed in the one of the most beach settings- San Diego-(La Jolla), CA (yes, yes!!)

~clear and easy to understand instruction delivered with a soothing,  complimentary voice.

The voice-over gives the names of the poses (mostly using their sanskrit names, but you easily figure out the insturctor means updog and downdog at the beginning of the warmup) but doesn't provide guidance on exact posture so I wouldn't recommend that beginners do this practice until they have a solid foundation by other means. The instructor has a very relaxing voice. She only gives cues, doesn't go into tangents onto the mystical parts of yoga or anything like that. The focus is on the poses.

This is a very comprehensive video starting with a 7-minute standing meditation and ending with a lengthy restorative shavasana. In between are all the major elements of a complete yoga routine: vinyasa flow, back bends, hip openers and inversions. I like to keep a lot of yoga videos in circulation for home practice and this one mimics the feel of a studio class the most.

One last point I'd like to stress is the overall energy of the video. The background is stunning to look at, the poses are clearly articulated and the narrators voice is very soothing.
