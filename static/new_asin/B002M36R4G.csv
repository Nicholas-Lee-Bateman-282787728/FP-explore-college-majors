3951308,2,B002M36R4G,"Dark Mirror is a decent effort at horror/thriller/suspense with a limited budget.  By appearances and performances alone one would think this movie's budget was much more than the shoestring budget it probably had.  Lisa Vidal is exotic and interesting as a bored housewife moving into a new home.  When she takes a photo in a mirror, she soon realizes there are abnormalities in the glass reflections.  She's tense throughout, but there is no tension.  She's rattled enough to frantically search for, and compulsively suck on, numerous cigarettes.  But it's never really that bad.  Her limp, and stereotypical skeptical, husband is no more than a seat filler.

It's one of those movies that has a lot of unrealized potential that would have been better in more competent hands.  As it is, however, there are no scares, zero dread, and a feeling that it's much longer than it really is...which is not a good thing.",1320105600,3,914,4.921568627450981
3951309,3,B002M36R4G,"There were some scenes that were done well enough that it creeps you out and is definitely suspenseful. Unfortunately, there are many more scenes that are poorly done and just plain annoying or cheesy. The mystery of the house, the history of the house, the windows and the caped person were better aspects of the film.

Some scenes were overdone, such as the scene where the woman is banging on her window. They are obviously trying to put the focus on the main character's ""confusion"" while having the woman banging the window in the background, but all I kept thinking when I saw it was that it was so stupid that she was banging on the window like that. She was overreacting and it did not seem realistic at all in my opinion. Some scenes were fake looking and others were just silly. I was really interested in the people she took pictures of ending up missing, but in the end there is not really an adequate reason as to why this happened.

The main character was very annoying, and frankly, just acted stupid throughout the movie. I got the feeling they were trying to make it into this situation where we are caught up in the main character's confusion and identifying with her, but I found it hard to do that because I was distracted by her annoying actions. She finds a painting of what looks like a dead naked woman and what does she do? Hangs it on the wall. I am also a little sick of movies portraying women main characters as having a son that she is very attached to (what is with this?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/B00005JLTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wes-Craven-s-New-Nightmare/dp/B001GPR01K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wes Craven's New Nightmare</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Jeopardy/dp/0792160215/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Jeopardy</a>, just to name a few).

3951310,4,B002M36R4G,"If you enjoy Asian horror, and are tired of endless Americanized remakes of Asian films, I think you'll really enjoy Dark Mirror. It's an American (indie) film, but it has all the elements of a good Asian ghost story--there is a quiet, slow build-up of darkness and dread, a wrathful ghost who metes out punishment to all who enter her domain, and a blurring of the lines between reality and imagination that makes us question what really happened to the very end.

A new home in a new city promises a new start for photographer Deborah Martin, who longs to escape from being a homemaker and return to her artistic career. Fitting then, that she has moved into the home of a famous painter, Rupert Wells and his wife, Eleanor. But the painter and his family went mysteriously missing, and one by one, the neighbors are going missing, too. Deborah is convinced that the disappearances are tied to her home, which has strange passageways and hidden clues. Unless she can decipher the puzzle and learn the true fate of the painter's family, she and her husband [James Chisum] and son [Joshua Pelegrin] may face the same fate.

Dark Mirror works on several levels, creating an disturbing atmosphere and intriguing puzzles. There is the story of Deborah, and her struggle to find herself again, to regain her identity as an artist. There is the parallel between Eleanor and Deborah, and the effect it has on Deborah's mind. And there is the puzzle of the house, and the secrets that Rupert and Eleanor hid within its walls and its otherworldly recesses. Good acting and effective pacing enhance the storyline, drawing us in and building in us the same curiosity and dread that Deborah experiences. Overall, Dark Mirror is a refreshing addition to the horror genre, especially in this era of remakes and sequels; it is nice to see that someone can draw upon the themes and styles of foreign horror and do more than create yet another unnecessary remake.",1299801600,3,1947,4.774480712166172
3951311,2,B002M36R4G,"Dark Mirror (Pablo Proenza, 2009)

I've been sitting here all day writing good-to-great reviews of things like The Maltese Falcon and Black Swan, so it's almost a relief to get to a film that I can without reservation call a pathetic piece of crap. And I readily admit that this is not nearly as bad a movie as that would make it out to be; it's paling in comparison to the company it's been keeping on my retinas. It's not the worst movie I watched that weekend, even (that would be the execrable 2008 remake of It's Alive), but it's derivative, badly-acted and -directed and all-around silly. You deserve better than this. Give me a few and I'll tell you how you can get it.

Deborah Martin (Star Trek's Lisa Vidal) is a former photographer who gave up her career to get married and start a family. The batch of them, Deborah, husband Jim (Flight of the Living Dead's David Chisum), and son Ian (Joshua Pelegrin in his first and, to date, last big-screen role), are moving out to the country to get away from it all. They look at an endless succession of houses, but there's one that they step into, and immediately Deborah is taken with it. (You've heard this before, right?) After dithering on so many other houses, when she says ""we'll take it"", Jim is thrilled he can finally stop looking at houses, and they do. Deborah soon learns that the house was originally inhabited by a reclusive, possibly crazy, painter who may or may not have killed his entire family and hidden them somewhere in the house. More importantly, their spirits may be trapped in the house's mirrors. (You've heard this before, right?)

It gets better. The big twist ending has been done to death. In fact, the movie is often compared, and never favorably, to a classic flick that has the same twist ending. It's also been done more recently in two excellent movies, and I'm not even considering the genre classic that started it all, and the almost-as-excellent homage to it that came out thirty years later. (I'm avoiding names in order to avoid spoilers; if you want to know the films I'm talking about, they'll be at the bottom of the review after spoiler space.) As well as, naturally, any number of dozens of movies that have tried it and failed miserably. This is only one of a huge crop. It doesn't help that few of the actors in this movie are any good, and those who are are relegated to stereotype roles at best (Lupe Ontiveros is the most visible member of this cast in that regard). Writer/director Pablo Proenza was working on his first feature-length movie. He's not an awful director, and maybe if he'd had some original material and a few decent actors to work with, he might have come up with something worthwhile. This ain't it. **

POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW

For the record, and if this roster doesn't give away the twist ending, then I can't help you.

""In fact, the movie is often compared, and never favorably, to a classic flick that has the same twist ending."" (Roman Polanski's Repulsion.) ""It's also been done more recently in two excellent movies,"" (I'm thinking specifically of Naboer and Black Swan, though I'm sure you can come up with half a dozen others) ""and I'm not even considering the genre classic that started it all, and the almost-as-excellent homage to it that came out thirty years later.""

3951312,3,B002M36R4G,"I am usually skeptical of made-for-the channel movies, unless it's like HBO. IFC apparently made this, and I thought it was pretty good. It has some original scares and plot ideas, or at least I didn't notice any cliches. This is probably the best 'mirror' movie made in modern times, very much surpassing the theater movies 'Mirrors' and another I think I saw recently. They sure did more with less. It wasn't dirty either. They stuck to the story and it was all supernatural. Those looking to see another nudey flick with dumb characters you hope will get killed off, with just a minor horror subplot, will have to look elsewhere. I didn't like the woman playing the lead, though. I do not like that ER show she's in and I think she's ugly and kind of stupid. Her mouth hangs open almost the entire time. Sign of a low IQ. I guess you get who you get for a low budget flick, but the money they saved went into a good script and decent effects.",1288483200,,945,4.375

That moment never came. This movie is predictable and has some bad acting too. So ya know, I bought this dvd used for 2 bucks. I think I paid too much for it.",1278115200,4,328,3.838235294117647
3951314,5,B002M36R4G,"I really enjoyed Dark Mirror.  It's not your typical scary movie, but that's what makes it so good.  The story grips you right from the beginning and never lets you go.  It's a very spooky, suspenseful thrill ride that kept me so off balance I didn't see the very clever plot twist at the end of the film coming.  The direction is superb as are the performances.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.  However, I would recommend NOT watching this one alone!",1257724800,6,460,4.352941176470588
3951315,4,B002M36R4G,"Dark Mirror is one best horror flicks of 2009! It's scary but not the usual, banal 'blood and gore' scary - it's a Polanski kind of scary, a thinking person's horror film. The performances are fantastic and Lisa Vidal is mesmerizing. The scene in the bathroom where she's trying to convince her husband something is wrong with the house is absolutely brilliant - the kind of scene that is truly unforgettable, in that wonderfully unsettling way. Curious to see what this director does next because his talent really shines through despite the limitations of a presumably small budget. I think horror fans will definitely dig this flick - but I also think anyone who likes creative and intelligent filmmaking will appreciate it as well.",1253577600,23,735,4.935483870967742
3951316,4,B002M36R4G,"First time director, Pablo Proenza brings a dash originality and a nice hint of film making skill to 2009's independent thriller, Dark Mirror. A film about a lonely house wife Deborah (Lisa Vidal) that is going through the motions of moving into a huge new house and spending most of her time alone in it while her husband Jim (David Chisum)is away at work. All of this alone time gives Deborah a little too much time spent in her own head, and after she takes a photo of her bathroom mirror, she begins seeing things around her house that cause her to question her sanity. It's not the most original of stories,but you will find yourself engaged in this tale either way. There is some very solid acting, mainly from Vidal, who's Deborah character caries the film on her shoulders, and Vidal is quite capable of carrying the heavy load. When Chism is on screen, he brings some solid game too, and some of the best scenes involve interaction between Deborah and Jim, as they have some great back and forth banter guided by some witty and well written dialogue.

There is some impressive film making to be found at times throughout Dark Mirror. Shot on Super 16, it is a crisp looking film considering it is very low budget, the camerawork is solid with a feeling of claustrophobia as you are trapped in the house along side the Deborah character. There is also some very cool and different looking visual effects to portray the supernatural aspects of Dark Mirror, and one of the cooler effects is when Deborah takes the photo of the bathroom mirror and it has a ripple effect with a constant flash from her camera's flash bulb as it goes throughout the mirror's multiple dimensions.

Overall, Dark Mirror is a solid afternoon supernatural thriller, that is worth a look for what it achieves with its meager budget. Outside of the great opening scene (that I will keep to myself!), there's almost no violence in the film, nor is there much blood spilt, and while some of the deaths are a little on the weak side, Dark Mirror is enjoyable for a number of reasons. While I enjoyed this movie, and I am a dude, I would feel comfortable in saying that Dark Mirror is a film that may be great for woman, as it covers themes that many women in Deborah's position can relate to.",1253491200,29,2270,4.547677261613692

3951405,4,B002M36R4G,"Dark Mirror is a pretty decent horror film but there's definitely several really unforgivably lackluster moments that prevent it from being more intense.  It's about a photographer that soon realizes every time she snaps a photo of somebody, they either disappear or become murdered.  Is it just a coincidence?

Some of these events are unbelievable.  Her neighbor is a carefree exhibitionist?  What?  Her personality was just bizarre.  I had to laugh whenever the two women would have conversations because they were two VERY different women.  Anyway the exhibitionist woman probably isn't as bizarre as the photographer however- the photographer constantly has really horrible nightmares and visions involving bloody deaths, and the scene with the woman in the parking lot making severe threats towards the photographer for apparently hitting her car is another unusual piece of exaggerated writing that didn't quite make sense given its placement in the storyline (near the beginning).

A tacky piece of writing comes near the beginning when the photographer and her mother are having an in-depth conversation about mirrors and that her house was apparently blessed for having protective mirrors.  Something about demons being drawn to mirrors, getting sucked in and not being able to escape.  This whole scene just destroyed the horror effect and brought forward an unforgivable degree of tackiness instead.  That's NOT what the writers were going for either but that's the way it came across.

To make matters more confusing, the photographer woman apparently has delusional problems and sees things that aren't really happening (or sees images in the mirror- these are the scary parts).  Without spoiling some key moments, this would satisfyingly explain the awkwardness the first time she walks into the house and sees her mom in the kitchen.  The entire 10 minutes that ends the film is really spectacular and wraps up all the strange events nicely, and this is the *only* reason I'm giving the movie 4 stars.

8373491,5,B002M36R4G,Great stories. Reminds me of the Twilight Zone but better.,1484697600,,58,4.9
8373492,2,B002M36R4G,"Interesting concept, kind of stylish...but ultimately boring. I paused it, walked away, and didn't care enough to remember to resume. Not a completely terrible film, but not compelling either.",1482796800,,192,5.655172413793103
8373493,2,B002M36R4G,"Well, I was disappointed because I really love Lisa Vidal. I am gal it came with one of my subscriptions, because I don't think I would have been pleased with paying for the movie. Flat dialogue, the fading model next door character was so over the top, it just wasn't plausiable... A couple of jump scares. A surprisingly annoying fraidy-cat son of the couple probably gave the best performance. I have seen Vidal in several dramas, and was always so good. Not sure what happened...",1479686400,,483,4.694117647058824
8373494,1,B002M36R4G,Most horror movies try at least to have you like the victims some what so you hope they overcome whatever they are fighting but this movie goes the exact opposite method and gives you a family you hope loses the fight.,1479081600,,218,4.341463414634147
