7914531,1,B00001ODHW,This Movie Sucked!! It is bad even for Full Moon. Why do they even release crap like this?  oh man..,1353196800,,100,4.0
7914532,3,B00001ODHW,"What we have here has been concocted to resemble the first three episodes of a 30-minute TV series aimed at pre-teens and teenagers.  The plot is simplicity itself--- four ""hot teenagers"" protect the planets of our galaxy from the devious schemes of the evil Lord Doom.  The ""series"" borrows stop motion animation from at least three different movies, and some giant monster footage from yet a fourth.
Acting ranges from wooden to excellent. You can see some of the inexperienced actors searching for their floor marks as they walk on set.  The main inspiration, apart from STAR WARS and STAR TREK, seems to have been the Toho Studios 30-minute series beginning in the 1960s with ULTRAMAN.  The Planet Patrol fights a lot of giant monsters, in other words!  If you can mentally make yourself 10 years old again (I can, effortlessly), then you will love this. Otherwise, give it a miss, infidel.",1061424000,3,894,4.855263157894737
