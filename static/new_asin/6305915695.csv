7899699,5,6305915695,"This film captures the intoxicating feeling of freedom and sexual excess of the late 60's. The premise is dark and disturbing, but handled with pitch perfect writing, directing and acting. Do consider that the movie dates from 1969, so it has that campy feeling of that era, but it works!

It romps through the intricacies of sexual desire in an amazing effective and engaging manner. In this context, sex is about power and this movie presents that dichotomy of dominion and submission as a game of profound psychological intricacy. The plot is haunting and the ending offers a masterful surprise. I cannot say enough about this film, the music is a perfect counterpart to this visual style, surreal and psychedelic at times, campy and futuristic at others (echoes of Fellini and Luis Buel).

The DVD transfer kept the visual scratches and blemishes and discoloration, which lend the film an organic feeling that adds power to the notion that you are watching a forbidden film retrieved from a censored archive. This one is for art film lovers and avid connoisseurs only!

And I haven't even mentioned that the female lead is gorgeous (Dagmar Lassander) in that early 70s manner that makes one yearn for that time.
A cinematic gem hidden in the rough...",1238025600,10,1254,4.90566037735849
7899700,3,6305915695,"If you ever thought THE PRISONER could do with a lot more nudity, add the implied subtext of the last two humans on Earth who must mate along with Carnaby Street/mod interior design meets 2001 ... this is the movie for you! And yes, there's even a midget (though full clothed - let's not get too crazy here :-) )

It's kooky with nudity so how bad can that be?

While the nudity might not be as audacious as it was once - the rest of the storyline, the dialogue and the settings are still pure 1970's weird - and again, what's wrong with nudity?

Any fan of subversive cinema should put this on their list but one thing the other reviewer is correct about is that this is the a weak DVD transfer. Not the worst I've seen but pretty poor. NO color correction - let alone a print cleaned for DVD. Clearly transfered from a 35mm print that has faded colors and projector damage.

Otherwise, a 4-star film - audacious fun. So clearly worth seeing - hopefully, the next DVD version will offer a DVD made from the 35mm negative or at least digitally color-corrected and cleaned.",1205280000,,1072,4.371859296482412
7899701,3,6305915695,"I bought this film because I collect movies with mid-century modern sets. And, if you love the designs seen in such films as ""Barbarella"" or ""Our Man Flint"", this film offers a wealth of wacky interiors. I mean, for goodness sakes, the main character in this film has a trapeze over his bathtub. He also has a mobile of a bound woman in his closet, for some reason. (A closet that's full of women's clothes, I should add. Not that there's anything wrong with that...)

However, I was also expecting some sort of suspense film, and it does sort of start out as a suspense film, then things get weird and they just keep on getting weirder. My favorite scene involves the sudden appearance of an all-girl woodwind band. This is what I'd guess you'd call a ""subtle metaphor"".

Then there's the ""love theme"" from the movie. There's a complete version on one of the ""Easy Tempo"" CDs. Not only does it sound like it was sung phonetically, it sounds like it was written by someone using an English/Italian dictionary. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it's a catchy tune.

Finally, you have a romantic coupling in a swimming that plays out like the final showdown in a spaghetti western.

It's all too cool, too weird, too funny for words. A real surprise.

On the bad side, yes, the print is a bit washed out. Also, considering the price of the disk, there should have been some extras other than just the trailer. Some photos, posters, and such would have been nice.

However, if you love loungy soundtracks, interiors that look like something from ""Pad, a guide to ultraliving"", and movies that just zig and zag in ways you never expected, this one is for you.",1141516800,3,1663,4.545150501672241
7899702,3,6305915695,"So unmistakably 1960's that this is reminiscent of Barbarella and Franco's Succubus, although it's far more watchable than the latter.
The story is simple, an impossibly smooth and trendy misogynist kidnaps an attractive female colleague so he can abuse her to groovy sounds in his outrageously cool bachelor pad.
Beautifully shot and lit, well acted and certainly shocking in it's day, you can see the arthouse crowd of the time hailing it as a masterpiece. But time has taken its toll and it has changed from a shocking tale of lust, power and sexual deviance into a sexy and cool 60's curiosity that would still shock your granny, but not your mum.",969235200,13,651,4.821428571428571
7899703,1,6305915695,A real real disappointment. The  appalling quality of the DVD version of  this movie really does make a mockery of the format. Don't buy this under  any circumstances! Seek out the Salvation VHS version from the UK. A real  shame. This is one of the greatest examples of the genre. A visual and  aural work of genius ruined by the terrible quality of the DVD,968025600,34,358,4.446153846153846
