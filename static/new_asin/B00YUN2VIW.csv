Sellers will tell you upfront in description that ""Region 2 will Not work on standard U.S. DVD players"". ANYWAY, the event Elimination Chamber 2015 held on May 31 in Corpus Christi TX was Great! The Best match of the pay-per-view, and a Match Of The Year candidate, is John Cena vs. Kevin Owens in Owens first in-ring WWE match since moving up from NXT.",1449360000,2,531,4.32

It's a good thing that I bought this WWE DVD while the deals last. The British DVD release WWE Elimination Chamber 2015 might be worth a lot more than I paid for because it's a UK and European DVD only release as it's originally a WWE Network exclusive PPV that took place on May 31, 2015. This is also a multi-region DVD set to PAL Region 2 and 5 for UK, Japan, Europe, Africa, and Russia so this will also play on PAL Region 5 DVD players.

The match of the night is Kevin Owens vs. John Cena, and what a match that was considering that it's Kevin Owens' official debut coming out of NXT as the NXT Champion and it's a Champion vs. Champion non-title match.

The main event of the WWE Network PPV is Seth Rollins defending his WWE World Heavyweight Championship vs Dean Ambrose.",1442966400,2,876,4.361963190184049

8719264,4,B00YUN2VIW,"The Tag Team Elimination Chamber match for the tag team titles(The New Day (C) vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd vs. Los Matadores vs. The Ascension vs. The Prime Time Players vs. The Lucha Dragons) was a great opening match with no shortage of action. A little too much of a spot-fest at times. The 3 way match for the Divas title(Nikki Bella (C) vs. Paige vs. Naomi) was not great but pretty good. The Champion vs. Champion match(John Cena vs. Kevin Owens) was smart booking decision to have Owens go over, as hes here to stay on the main roster. The Neville-Bo Dallas match was a pretty pedestrian, save for Nevilles usual displays of freakish agility and air time. Inevitably a letdown after Owens/Cena. The Elimination Chamber for the vacated IC title( King Barrett vs. Sheamus vs. R-Truth vs. Ryback vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Mark Henry) didn't quite measure up to the previous chamber match, but a solid outing by all participants. The World Heavyweight title match(Seth Rollins (C) vs. Dean Ambrose) was a good match, although weve seen better from these two. The DQ will inevitably result in more title matches between these two and Ambrose has built even more sympathy with the audience. This feud could carry the next couple of PPVs. I give this show a 7 out of 10.",1440979200,2,1262,4.663677130044843
8719265,4,B00YUN2VIW,"It should be noted that this was WWE's first Network exclusive PPV event to their network (excluding previous NXT specials).

Elimination Chamber Match: WWE Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Prime Time Players vs. Lucha Dragons vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd vs. Los Matadores vs. The Ascension - While the rules & structure for this Elimination Chamber match was the same, this was the first time since the creation of the match that tag teams were participants. Various highlights include various high flying maneuvers executed from various spots of the chamber from the top of the pods to off the top of the roof, one man climbing around the chamber like he was Spiderman, one team trying to get involved in the action before they were legal in the match making them the odd team out, and how more than one team had a ""numbers advantage"" over the others. This was a really good Chamber match with lots of crazy spots & some teams looking better than they had been in a very long time.

Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Paige vs. Naomi - This was one of those triple threat matches that was non-stop action with some divas using different strategies such as trying to isolate one while focusing on the other & trying to take advantage of of a situation stealing pins along with other moments like one being thrown hard against the announce table, a facebuster across the knee, a tower of doom powerbomb, and one of the scariest looking reverse frankensteiners I've seen in a good match with all the divas working hard here.

John Cena vs. Kevin Owens - A rare ""champion vs. champion"" match as Owens was in control early staying one step ahead of Cena having counters to his offense & delivering some impactful moves of his own while continuing to taunt him whenever possible before Cena was able to take advantage of an opening as they traded momentum with Owens attempting Cena's own offense against him while Cena hit some impactful offense from different areas such as the top rope to a springboard position`with a finish that definitely shocked the world as this was the type of performance that makes a superstar & impact which it did for Kevin Owens in his WWE PPV debut as he was able to pull out the performance from Cena that pushed him to the limit.

Neville vs. Bo Dallas - It should be noted as the announcers pointed out that both men were former NXT Champions as it was Neville who defeated Dallas for the championship as Neville took the advantage with a series of kicks & even going aerial to the outside while Dallas attempted to ground him while taking some short cuts in an average match but the best Dallas has looked in a significant amount of time.

Intercontinental Championship/Elimination Chamber Match: Ryback vs. R-Truth vs. Mark Henry vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. King Barrett vs. Sheamus - Just like the tag team championship match earlier in the night, this was the first time that the Intercontinental Championship was on the line in this match after Daniel Bryan forfeited the championship earlier in the week while Mark Henry was a last minute participant due to the injury to Rusev earlier in the week. Various highlights include one man bringing the fight to one of the participants before he could exit the pod, how one of the participants ""escaped"" out his pod into the match while later another was trapped inside, unlikely alliances made to eliminate members, one man who was used to destroy the pods...twice, and when it got down to the final two as this was a solid chamber match.

WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - The former Shield members reignite their feud that started a year earlier with members of the Authority in J&J Security & Kane coming out with Rollins while Roman Reigns was banned from ringside. Ambrose was in control early before distractions allowed Seth to take advantage as they were evenly matched with both men having the same offensive maneuvers in mind along with sacrificing themselves such as a suicide dive that landed both men over the announce table & a clothesline out of Cactus Jack's old playbook that took both men over the top along with aerial offense from top rope elbows & knees to their standing opponents along with impactful offense such as a release powerbomb into the barricade & lariats turning their opponents inside out. These two always had natural chemistry & never had a bad match (just bad endings) against each other & this was no different as it was very physical from start to finish.

On the pre-show match was Stardust vs. Zack Ryder along with MizTV featuring Daniel Bryan. This was another solid show from start to finish with both chambers delivering some good action & other standout matches on the card so in the end, this is worth checking out.",1440201600,2,4740,4.703614457831326
