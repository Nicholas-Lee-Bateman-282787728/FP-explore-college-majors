8238074,4,B0010NVCSU,"This is a 54 minute documentary about Harlem heroin dealer Freddie Myers as told by Freddie himself. The film is told chronologically and in many ways glorifies drug trafficking and makes snitching look bad. As a documentary it was interesting, but it seems to give the wrong message.

For those who like this film may try free U-tube video : Superfly Untold story of Frank Lucas . You should also be able to find most if not all of the film available free on line. U-tube has clips and links.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1383436800,,536,4.515463917525773

Freddie personally tells his story after 24 years (!) of incarceration he did his time and never snitched on anyone.  He also shares stories about Frank Matthews and so called ""kingpin"" Frank Lucas.  I highly recommend this movie for fans of stories about ""true"" gangstas!
