2582277,5,B000FQIRWC,"I sarted watching ""Full House"" about 3 years ago and I loved it! I'm so happy to see season 4 coming out on DVD! I wanna own all 8 seasons!! God Bless Full House!!!",1148947200,3,164,3.8529411764705883
2582278,5,B000FQIRWC,"I have to admit, the 2nd and 3rd seasons of Full House are by far my favorite.  As the show progressed into its final two or three seasons, the episodes became a bit slow and melodramitic.  The cuteness of ""what would Michelle say next"" wore off.  However, season four still provides much of what Full House made popular: good family values still has its ""value"" in society.  The girls are given much more engaging and real story lines.  Having experienced an eating disorder myself, Full House presented what every teenager experiences: the pressure to fit in and be accepted.  I love the fact that Full House married Jesse and Rebecca.  Too many times, a person is brought onto the show as a love interest and nothing happens (i.e. Danny and Vicki.)  That has always bothered me about Full House: the fact that Danny never married (wouldn't that have been a great series finale, getting Danny married instead of Michelle ""bumping her head.""  Joey never had a meaningful relationshp.  Whatever happened to Danny's sister Wendy?  They were cute.  But, I digress...Full House (Season 4) is good and shows the series at its finest.  I am glad to see the seasons being released one after another.  I hope to own all eight seasons.  Long live Full House!!",1148860800,11,1251,4.753488372093023
2582279,5,B000FQIRWC,"considered by many to be the best season, season 4 is classic. It includes all the regular characters and introduces a few new faces including my personal favorite Rusty the self styled ""master of disaster"". He only appears in two episodes this season but both in my opinion make a strong case to be called the best single episodes in the entire full house series. The 2nd one ""secret admirer"" which includes a much circulated misunderstood love letter throughout the episode is particualarly good. I am thrilled to see season 4 is on the way and have already pre ordered it. My only question is ""when are seasons 5-8 coming"" I hope its soon.",1148515200,5,642,4.640350877192983
2582280,5,B000FQIRWC,why i call it the best show of all times is because i have watched this show since i was five and now i am 17. i love to go and say HOW RUDE! as a joke. i just love full house but if it whent off tv i would not miss it because it is om dvd. but if it whent off tv and they stoped the dvds i weould be upset. so please keep buying the full house dvds. thank you FULL HOUSE FAN FOR EVER,1148256000,2,384,3.375
2582281,5,B000FQIRWC,"The classic 1980's-1990's sitcom ""Full House"" showed gradual improvement from Season 1 to Season 2, as well as from Season 2 to Season 3, but I believe that this 4th season is where the series was truly launched as the fun, lighthearted, and wholesome show that it was. A lot of changes took place, but that same formula of family love and closeness remained to give ""Full House"" the footing it needed to remain successful.

Season 4 was filled with many happy times and humorous occasions, beginning with the hilarious series opener ""Greek Week,"" progressing with Joey's Las Vegas gig to open up for Wayne Newton, and of course, continuing with the long-awaited 1-hour episode that chronicled the beautiful wedding of Jesse and Becky (but as Michelle would say, ""everything went bananas"" on that day!) There were also many sweet and often dramatic moments sprinkled throughout the season, mainly with the three Tanner kids. Now ages 4, 9, and 14 (approximately), the girls are all growing up and contributing more emotion to the storylines. Teenager DJ struggles with peer pressure and experiments with a crash diet to shape up for an upcoming pool party, and a mother/daughter sleepover shows Stephanie the pangs of not having a mom in her life. Even little pre-schooler Michelle learns a tough lesson in family separation after her beloved Uncle Jesse gets married and considers moving out for good. The three of them were always very cute, and now that they are getting older, the material given to them is becoming stronger and fitting to their talent.

The impressively quick-paced release of these ""Full House"" DVD's has been very enjoyable for long-time fans of the series (the first half of the series has already been released!), and with the obvious success that the DVD transfer has had, I am sure we can look forward to seeing Seasons 5-8 in the near future!",1148256000,21,1871,4.899053627760252

2582286,5,B000FQIRWC,"I purchased The Hole in the Wall Gang episode on here. And what I have to say about this episode is that when DJ and Stephanie punched a hole in Danny's bedroom wall and were trying to fix it before came home just because he was such a neat freak, doesn't anyone here think that the best thing for DJ and Stephanie to do was to just let their dad know about the hole in the wall instead of trying to cover it up no matter how much of a neat freak he was? I'm sure he would have understood.",1479513600,,489,3.9

As with other shows I've reviewed, keep in mind that as the seasons go by and the characters age, you will find more situations that are related to love interests and other types of things in keeping with older children.

2582387,5,B000FQIRWC,"Full House The Fourth Season was a very funny season. My favorite episodes are the rusty episodes and the wedding episodes. This is my favorite season with Jodie Sweetin. For me she was a fantastic actress in all the episodes this fourth year. Her interactions with kimmy who is also funny and rusty were hysterical. Actually everybody interactions with rusty were hysrerical. This is the first season where I start to have a crush on Jodie Sweetin. She is now a little bit older, sort of almost close to the preteen stage. Jodie now has her georgeous new staightend hair due and she looks absoultley beautiful this season. She also shows what a very good drama actress she is in the episodes Slumber Party, Shape Up, and Stepanie Plays The Field. I really really do love her this season. In my eyes she desevred an award for best young comedine actress this year.

2582399,4,B000FQIRWC,"This is the first season I of the show I liked every episode of.  I loved the show seasons 4-8, but hated it abominably until the beginning of season 3.  Season 4 was probably the shows peak season.  5-8 were fine, and some even fantastic, but there were no bad episodes in season 4.  There were some in season 3 but they were hit and miss at best.  The older the girls got the better the show was, and this season, they began to grow up and the sugary-sweet cliches were not close to as many as previous seasons.

Season 4, (and season 5 honorable mention) was the best, I highly recommend it.",1178496000,,594,4.212389380530974

2582401,5,B000FQIRWC,"Even though I'm in my early 30's, this is what I grew up with.  I love it still and it brings back memories of school vacation watching these same episodes over and over again.
This is one of the better seasons.  It starts with Greek Week where some of Jesse's family comes over from Greece with some surprises (also the episode where he proposes to Becky) and ends with Rock The Cradle in which Becky finds out that she's pregnant just as Jesse finds out he's going out on the road for a tour.  The absolute standout episode and in my opinion is the best episode in the entire 8 seasons, is Secret Admirer.  Danny is dating a girl with a son called Rusty who is a trouble maker.  He writes a love letter and one thing leads to another and havoc ensues.  Hillarious.
While this doesn't seem as funny anymore after the likes of the humour that came from Friends or Two And A Half Men, it's an innocent (if not sometimes corny) humour that is perfectly fit for all ages and especially kids.  This also happens to be the season where Jesse looks his hottest.  I love this show and still do to this day.  I highly recommend it if you want to revisit a great family, or introduce them to your kids.",1174953600,5,1193,4.266666666666667
2582402,5,B000FQIRWC,"We now have all five seasons of full house.(waiting on the 6th)  There are not many good choices for kids on tv these days and I am really thrilled my kids would just as soon watch Full House.

I just don't think you can go wrong here.........we have a special dvd holder just for our Full House DVD's...........",1173571200,3,312,4.362068965517241
2582403,5,B000FQIRWC,"I used to watch this show when it was originally on the air. Now my step-daughter (13) absolutely loves the series. Neither my husband nor myself can stand to sit through an episode, as the writing & acting are (not surprisingly) far more sub-par than I remembered. However, the girl loves 'em & always asks for the season boxed sets as gifts. Since we don't typically watch TV, getting to watch a few episodes of ""her show"" is a great treat.

The show's premise is simple. Dad, Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) is left widowed with three daughters, D.J. (Candace Cameron), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), & Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olson). Brother-in-law, Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), & best friend, Joey (Dave Coulier), move in to help Danny raise the girls. However, the three men barely stand a chance against the young girls' innocent faces, cute quips, & girlish charm.

The show is fairly innocent & clean, safe for almost all ages. There really isn't much objectionable here, unless you want to avoid cheesy writing & acting. Sisterly love & the importance of family are strong themes here, which is always a plus. This show is definitely preferred to much of today's TV-fare, in my opinion.",1173139200,3,1188,4.818627450980392
2582404,5,B000FQIRWC,"The Tanner Family is back to make us laugh with season four of Full House.

The big news this season is a wedding.  Becky (Lori Loughlin) and Jesse (John Stamos) tie the knot.  We go from the proposal to the ceremony this season with such stops along the way as buying the ring (and Jesse selling his Elvis guitar to pay for it), picking a location (Graceland or Kansas), and Jesse picking a best man.

But the wedding isn't the only storyline.  There's still plenty for the rest of the gang.  Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) discovers that there can be consequences when she misbehaves.  Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) is tempted to throw a baseball game for a really cute boy.  D.J. (Candace Cameron) becomes editor of the school newspaper and finds that hiring your best friend (Andrea Barber's Kimmy) can lead to problems if she doesn't do the work.  Danny (Bob Saget) dates a dry cleaner with a prankster of a son and a much younger woman.  And Joey (Dave Coulier) reunites with his dad and gets a chance at TV stardom along side Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello.

This season has a couple of other standout episodes.  ""Slumber Party"" finds Stephanie trying to decide what to do about the mother-daughter sleepover her Honeybee hive is having.  This episode truly tugs at the heartstrings.  Also in that category is ""Fuller House.""  The episode right after Becky and Jesse's wedding, everyone struggles with the idea of Jesse moving out of the house, especially Jesse and Michelle.  And for a downright funny episode, look no further then ""Secret Admirer"" which finds a love letter making the rounds with absolutely hilarious results.  Also noteworthy this season, the season premier features one of the few times that Mary-Kate and Ashley appear on screen together.

As always, the cast is great and the shows are funny.  Yes, it will appeal to kids and others who enjoy family entertainment most.  But for them, this set will be a real treat.",1172707200,3,1954,4.793413173652695

2582406,3,B000FQIRWC,"My daughter loves this season, as Michelle is spewing out funny comments and talking more than any of the other 3.  One thing I have a problem with watching this set is the poor transfer quailty of some of the episodes.  The picture is nowhere near sharp, and looks like watching an old television with an antenna, where the outline of people is double.  It's even worse the VHS quality, because at least that is sharp.  Some episodes are worse than others, such as the one where Joey does the show with Frankie Avalon, which is horrible.  This episode just aired on ABC Family this week, and it was crystal clear, so I am not sure what happened with the DVD transfers.  And then the very next show after that one is fine, so it's not consistent.  The packaging seems to get smaller each season, so maybe they cut costs on offering a high quality transfer as well.  However, season 5 does not seem to have this problem.

It's a good season, as the kids are a little older, and all actor's have settled into their roles well.  I think seasons 3 and 4 are the best of the series.  Kid's will probably not notice the difference in picture quality on this 4th season, but it certainly annoyed me.",1169596800,,1192,4.397260273972603

2582422,5,B000FQIRWC,"This is probably my favorite season. That being said, one thing that bugged me and made me write to Warner Brothers, and urge others to write, was that Michelle was described as ""out of control"" in ""Crimes and Michelle's Misdemeanor."" Her ""first punishment""? Impossible, no child could realistically go without punishment till almost 4 without being a terror the likes of Rusty times two. Funny thing is, she *was* under control for D.J. - she orders her to rake the leaves she kicked over, and Michelle took the rake and obeyed like a perfectly well-adjusted girl.

Guess what? they might not have found a way to do extras, but they did answer that concern. For Jesse's comment that ""she's out of control"" is gone. Outta here. History.

It's a shame they didn't add anything. But, by cutting that sentence out of the DVD version, they chose to adopt a much more realistic position as show canon. Michelle was not ""out of control,"" D.J. had been disciplining her since she was little, that's why she was so well-behaved in seasons 2 and 3, except for a little attitude that she gets from Jesse.

Indeed, without Jesse's comment, it's easier to see the other things that show this - michelle had to sneak around after bedtime, when if she'd never been punished she'd have turned the TV up loud. And, she asks from Danny's tone if she's in ""big tgrouble, Mister"" when if she'd never been in trouble, she could *never* guess from his tone that she was about to put put in the corner as punishment. (And, later, punished for not going to bed, completing that loose end.)

What this means is that now, her small bit of disobedience makes sense. She wasn't out of control. She saw D.J. as her ultimate authority, and D.J. finally decided she didn't have the time, and so she sort of let go a little, hoping Danny would catch on.

This happens in family's w/single parents, especially dads, at times; an older sibling, usually a sister, becomes the disciplinarian. We see by the end of season 4 that Danny has adjusted well.

So, for those who like a thinking man's TV, where they really make it realistic, this is it. Oh, and how does Danny still get away with calling it her very first punishment? Well, let's say D.J. used the ""one minute per age"" rule for timeout, of 3 minutes. Danny pushes it up to 5 minutes, or 6. That's a 67-100% increase, enough to go from just timeout to actual punishment for a child Michelle's age.",1156809600,3,2421,4.5796766743648964

I got into watching the show in reruns in 2001.

Good show, not the best ever created, but a clean family show.

So, now half the run of the show has been released on DVD.  I like watching extras on DVD's.
