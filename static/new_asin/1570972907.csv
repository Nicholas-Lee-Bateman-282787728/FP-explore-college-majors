8197164,5,1570972907,"It seems contemporary spirituality has forgotten the root-principle known to the ancients in every spiritual esoteric tradition: The Guru Is Sufficient. Meaning that all forms of seeking, all forms of grasping and avoiding in the realm of conditionality, are inherently limited as forms of change. The eternal, the Real, the Truth, the never absent Light of Reality-Truth, is the only inherently sufficient anything, since that Bright Reality-State is not limited by birth, or change, or even death. And what is that Self-Condition and Self-State and Self-Nature but the very State of the Guru.

The Guru is the ""Light that Outshines the darkness of ego"". The endless changes of patterns in the apparent objective world come and go, appear and disappear, change and certainly die. That samsaric round is up and down, and regardless of degree of apparent ""success"", to the heart, insufficient.

Therefore, the Guru Is the only Sufficiency in life, and this very early DIscourse of Sri Sri Adi Da Samraj is a happy, bright, wise, clearly elucidated, humor filled, stream of wisdom uttered by the Awakened Master for the sake of all.",1352332800,2,1130,5.135869565217392
