2614619,2,B000GJ26NY,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. First of all, I didn't know it was just a filmed seminar. After getting through the first 10 minutes or so of him talking about Southwest Airlines for some perplexing reason, it finally started to get intriguing. But in the end the whole video ends up being an infomercial, or advertisement, for his 2-day weekend seminar, which costs an unmentionable $800. He does give a few interesting and good pointers along the way, but most of it wasn't new to me, and he offers it only as a teaser to the supposed true wealth of information presented in his ""Harmonic Wealth Weekend"". Very disappointing. I don't recommend this DVD to anyone. The introductory information he offers can be found elsewhere for a lesser cost, or even free, and you won't be left with a DVD which you'll never watch again to clutter up your shelf. I almost gave a generous 3 stars, but I remembered the faltering audio quality and took it down to 2. That really is all this DVD deserves, especially after feeling duped into paying money to see an infomercial.",1176163200,48,1067,4.621052631578947
2614620,5,B000GJ26NY,"I highly recommend this dvd to any and all who wish to improve their lifestyle, relationships, attitudes, and financial status.",1175558400,,127,5.4
2614621,3,B000GJ26NY,"I feel the need to respond to A. Alger who states in his review here that What the Bleep has nothing to do with Quantum Physics.  Hello???  Have you actually seen this movie?  Moreover, have you seen the Quantum edition of What The Bleep?  Many of the people who get lengthy interviews in the Quantum Edition are Physicists from Ivy League type schools (their academic credentials are difficult to dispute) and in fact these physicists are often very difficult to understand when they get into the nitty gritty of quantum physics.  They are NOT talking fluff.

I heard James Ray speak this weekend and while I felt a lot of his stuff was somewhat basic in New Age type of thought, his idea of techniques working at the Quantum level takes What The Bleep a step further by making it practical and seems intriguing to say the least.

You have to wonder who people like A. Alger are who flippantly dismiss an entire area of cross-displinary study with absolutely no evidence to back up their statements.  It's cynical, smug people like A. Alger who empower themselves by putting others down, and that's a losing game.",1174867200,16,1114,4.676923076923077
2614622,1,B000GJ26NY,"This movie, or what the bleep, or the secret, have nothing to do with Quantum Physics.  If you think that what is spoken about in these films is real, or Physics, please get educated.

These area all nothing but a ruse, it is an effort to drop esoteric terms into crackpot ideas in order to give them substance in the eyes of the uneducated.  Do not let them make a fool of you.",1172102400,11,378,4.1506849315068495
2614623,5,B000GJ26NY,"This presentation isn't for everybody. But it's a great starting point for two types of people: 1) Those who are familiar with personal development or self help but have no idea why it should work; 2) Those who are familiar with quantum physics (hello, all you What the Bleepers) but don't know how to ground those theories into physical and tangible results.

Think of it as a bridge in between ""What the Bleep"" and ""The Secret"".",1159228800,46,430,4.657894736842105
8133160,3,B000GJ26NY,This was an introductory seminar used to up sale a bigger program. He hits a few good points. Not life changing but worth a listen.,1463443200,,131,4.28
8133161,2,B000GJ26NY,"Although that some of the content is exciting this video is nothing more than a sales and marketing pitch for a weekend retreat.  In addition, the video production itself is poor at best.  I am an avid student of quantum theory and I was disappointed with this DVD.",1216425600,,265,4.5
8133162,2,B000GJ26NY,"Am a big fan of James Ray having his books and Audio CDs.

Whilst the DVD was good in some parts it ended up being more of a promo for his Weekend Training Sessions and people should not buy this expecting to recieve answer.",1203292800,2,224,4.090909090909091
8133163,5,B000GJ26NY,"I recommend the Quantum Creations DVD. I am a PhD social psychologist who has been studying the construction of reality for 15 years and I was able to benefit from this DVD. I find that James Ray is emerging in my mind as perhaps the most outstanding teacher in this area because he is able to take complex concepts and break them down so that they are easy to understand. I have studied just about every great teacher in this area and James is at the top of my list. I have personally watched this DVD a number of times and I will keep it as a part of my permanent collection. I also recommend James's book, ""The Science of Success"". Yes, the video contains an invitation to attend the ""Harmonic Wealth Weekend"". As soon as my own teaching and travel schedule allow, I plan to attend.",1202083200,2,785,4.346938775510204
8133164,3,B000GJ26NY,"A little on the harsh side compared to more recent writings, etc by James, but still useful and engaging.",1194998400,2,105,4.578947368421052
8133165,4,B000GJ26NY,"There are some very good ideas presented in this DVD. The one I came away with that had the most resonance was ""It's not what you DO but HOW YOU do it that determines your success"". Within that short sentence I got to really thinking about the few people I know that are happy. It finally made sense to me why most people are unhappy and burned out in their jobs and lives. You will either get it or you won't at the level he is trying to convey. There are several ""aha"" moments for me that made it worth viewing.

On the negative side, for someone who teaches ""Harmonic Wealth"" and living prosperously in all areas of life I would think he would be able to afford a tailor made suit and get a professional looking haircut. His appearance is distracting as is the low rent stage he speaks from. Also he tries very hard to sell his for money seminar which is very offputting. This presentation appeared to be the ""free"" teaser seminar which genarally preceeds the multi thousand dollar seminars many of these ""wealth"" teachers offer. I still found much enlightening and usable material and would recommend it.",1187136000,7,1108,4.512437810945274
8133166,2,B000GJ26NY,The video back drop is almost as annoying as the listening to James A. Ray. Still if you can filter out his drab suit that is the color of the curtain .. and all the marketing for his next programs .. you can actually learn something. In particular his discussion of the observer effect of quantum physics is well done.  The rest is more of a tease for a weekend workshop following which you can sign up for 7 months of support because 'clearly you can't do this alone' ..  not recommended,1182902400,9,489,4.304347826086956
8133167,4,B000GJ26NY,"This was a great dvd, and I really loved what James Arthur Ray spoke about and displayed.  He is a great speaker and a great source for the improvement of life.

Thank you",1180396800,2,171,4.151515151515151
8133168,2,B000GJ26NY,"I LOVE James Ray and all that he teaches.  I've been to his free seminars and others and I buy and study his material.  I was disappointed that this DVD was another tool to sell the Harmonic Wealth weekend.  There is some good stuff in it, but it's the same as all of his free seminars and then, the big sell.  It was a waste of my money.  I've seen it all before and was hoping to see something more.",1179014400,14,401,3.9625
8133169,4,B000GJ26NY,I seen this movie and thank it is reel good. I is verry educated myself and am glad to be seeing a movie on physsics that i can relate to. I reccomend it to other educated people to.,1178496000,,182,3.8157894736842106
