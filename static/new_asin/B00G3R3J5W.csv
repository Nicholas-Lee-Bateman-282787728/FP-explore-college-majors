6056651,4,B00G3R3J5W,"Wonderful documentary on the reality of sexuality. Interesting story of Buck Angel a porn actor and activist. Angel is a man, with a vagina. Angel was born a woman but created himself as a man in body form. Angel left his vagina creating something truly odd, unique, and very different. He does gay porn which makes it all the stranger. If you came upon him you would never know he had a vagina or had been a women. Angel does not believe in a different sexuality. Just because you have a vagina or a penis, what does that mean, and why does it make you a man or woman? Why does that define you? Brilliant documentary. Truly logical and a wonderful understanding through Buck Angels reality which should be everyone's. Eye opening. A must see film.",1453420800,,748,4.507352941176471
6056652,4,B00G3R3J5W,"I think we are all fascinated by transgender. These profiles help take away some of the mystery and personalizes the individual. Buck Angel is one of those people that is doing  that and hopefully helping those that follow. I feel like saying it's mid blowing, but also want to say that the more we get to know about people, the less mind blowing it will become.",1446854400,,362,4.484848484848484

6056654,5,B00G3R3J5W,"I think his work is very important. He shows people the truth of what many people live. He is not ashamed of who he is like most of society wants him to be. He is not a freak. He is a very normal transgender man. If you see him as anything else then that is a reflection of your lack of education. His work is making people have the conversations on gender. It is a shame how much pain we have changed transgendered people with out ignorance.

I am very proud of his work!!",1411689600,2,473,4.031914893617022
6056655,5,B00G3R3J5W,"I LOVE BUCK AND THIS DOCUMENTARY. He just seems like such a cool guy with no hang ups. This is a great look into a great and very interesting man. I have never seen any of his films i learned about Buck through the Howard Stern show, and so glad i am able to find out more, he is a top notch guy with a great sense of humor as well as an almost childlike interest about life and people.",1407456000,,386,3.8375
6056656,2,B00G3R3J5W,"Being a morbidly obese person with severe depression and no social life, my only link to the outside world is film and internet. So I'm always on the lookout for inspirational movies to help motivate me and to break out of my melancholia. I overheard a co-worker talking about this documentary and checked it out online. I was initially put off by the movie due to Mr. Angel being a suicidal, alcoholic, drug using, porn actor and former prostitute. I found it hard to empathize with someone who would engage in such self destructive behavior and then whine about being unhappy. I've had hard knocks in my life but it never denigrated to that level except for my massive overeating. But as I continued watching, I developed a bit of admiration for Buck as I realized that she was ultimately trying to attain self acceptance, happiness and success. The things that all people want. You don't have to be a tranny or a gay to appreciate the message of this film. You may ask then why only 2 stars? Well, I was looking online to see if Buck Angel had more motivational vids and came across two alarming updates on wiki. Apparently, Mr. Angel was involved in an internet pyramiding scheme which was shut down and she is now estranged from her wife. I felt rather betrayed. I really thought this person had it all together despite adversity. Her message is meaningless because it didn't work for her, so why would it work for me? I guess ultimately it was all just a freakshow.",1401580800,,1471,4.575757575757576

8620483,5,B00G3R3J5W,This was amazing!  Should be required viewing for young adults.,1524182400,,63,5.3
8620484,5,B00G3R3J5W,"A great documentary about a profound man (with a vagina) who struggled to create and step into the man he knew he really was.  Buck is a profound transgender role model and educator that uses his past struggles and learnings to literally change the world and the way people think about gender and sexuality.

The documentary is sensitive, touching and real.  You can't help but to be touched by his authenticity, caring and courage.  He blows so many stereotypes out of the water... you can't help but be more expanded it.

A must for anyone exploring gender issues or looking for greater self acceptance.",1521331200,,605,4.778846153846154

8620489,5,B00G3R3J5W,I think anyone who does not understand the struggles of a transgender person shoud watch this movie. Anyone who struggles to be the person they want to be should watch this. You don't have to be transgender to take away something positive from this journey. Buck put his mind to being who he wanted to be and you can tell by his joyous laugh that he can now enjoy life to the fullest. People really need to take pause and listen without judgement to the message of this film.,1462752000,,475,4.348314606741573
8620490,5,B00G3R3J5W,"This is a great look into the live of a trans man who shows how much you can love your body, and express it to the world.
In my eyes he is truly an inspiration, a real man who isn't afraid of what people think of him, and who only wants other people to be just as confident.
I would personally recommend this movie for anyone wanting an emotional view on trans life, but even more so anyone who is trans themselves whom is going through a hard time.
My depression lifted, even if only for a brief time after watching this, and I would watch it again whenever I feel down or self-conscious about being trans myself.
Please, if you or anyone else you know who is trans, male/female or even anything else for that matter, who has body issues and is having a hard time with life, this will make you feel better about yourself.
Depression is a difficult thing to go through, especially if you feel like you are alone in the world, and Buck wants people to know that everything will be okay.
It gets better. Believe me. Believe him.

The only thing I would warn if you don't know much about Buck Angel, is that he is a porn star.
He does go into detail about what its like being in porn, you see him naked, ect, so if you are uncomfortable around nudity, this may not be the best thing to watch.
It only shows nudity around the first 20-30 minutes or so(I wasn't counting, so its just an estimate) but if you can get over that, its worth the watch.

11/10 would watch again and again.",1462492800,,1478,4.219081272084805
8620491,5,B00G3R3J5W,"Mr Angel is an excellent documentary into the life of Buck Angel. He is open about his struggles with family, career and his own identity. I appreciate Buck's candor, and expect his life will continue to be a roller coaster ride as he attempts to help the US and the world better understand trans*, health, and gender.",1462147200,,318,4.5964912280701755
