8028135,5,B0002IQ5DQ,one of the best movies period.,1430784000,,30,4.166666666666667
8028136,4,B0002IQ5DQ,Not much to it but very entertaining if you like the actors type of comedy. I liked it but it is hard to recommend in general since its a matter of opinion.,1367366400,,156,3.90625
8028137,5,B0002IQ5DQ,"Pay no attention to Ernest's post work.  This was his best of the best.

You meet Ernest's ancestors in a series of vignettes that range from Old West army post personnel to riverboat gamblers to carnival ride operators.  ""Surreal"" doesn't even begin to describe this film, but ""hilarious"" does.

Ernest plays most of the parts, from the meanest man in the world in one piece to his own grandpa in another piece.  The best showcase of his talents is in the army post skit--he does ALL the parts.  I saw it a few times before I realized it was actually him doing everything, he's that good.

The phrases from this film that have permanently become a part of my life:  ""Did you hear that?  Boy, I sure did."" and ""More like the color of wheat.""  Oh, and who could forget, ""Quoi Quoa, let's go fishing!""

If you like Ernest even just a little, you should buy this film.  It ranges from subtle to over-the-top and back again but it's never boring.  Highly recommended.",1346716800,,963,4.497109826589595
8028138,5,B0002IQ5DQ,"This is the second most entertaining bunch of characters Varney had ever done, only topped by the motley assortment in Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam. Granted, there are some slow parts, which probably tests some attention spans, but the Lloyd, pioneer, and Grandpa segments are just brilliant. This was a rare span in Varney & Cherry's collaborations where they seemed to do whatever got a kick out of, and it has a raw, hilarious, made-it-up-as-we-went-along quality. I'd love for this to be on DVD, but I think it's safe to say that's not happening... keep an eye out for it in the Blockbuster clearance bin.",1167350400,8,622,4.715596330275229
8028139,3,B0002IQ5DQ,I liked it but I don't think I would pay more than 15 bucks for a copy.  The part where his family are pretending to eat was hilarious.  It's very silly but falls in line with the rest of Mr. Varney's work.,1120608000,5,206,3.880952380952381
8028140,2,B0002IQ5DQ,"This has become an expensive collectors item, without cause, except that it is hard to find. It is a collection of 5 shorts,none great, 2 okay, one tolerable, and 2 that are terrible. Varney's video ""Your World as I see it"" is much funnier, and shows more diversity.",1112140800,3,266,4.5625
