2168098,4,B00064VR0W,"I haven' bought the dvd yet.  There's a question about guest artists.  In Rod's web page, talking about this dvd, it says that E. Clapton, Steve Wonder, Cher, appear in it, but they are not mentioned in these reviews. Where is the truth?

I just rated it because i had too, so I could send this question.",1103155200,,304,4.298245614035087
2168099,5,B00064VR0W,"This is absolutely the best Rod Stewart DVD so far. The mix of his classic material and material from his ""American Songbook"" series is great; 12 classic Rod songs & 5 ""American Songbook"" songs.

The video is stunning and the audio is crystal clear. You have a choice of 2.0 stereo or 5.1 surround. Both are great.

Special guests on this extravaganza are Ronnie Wood, Chrissie Hynde, and a Scottish busker named Amy Belle (a future star?).Rod's girlfriend also appears in a stunning role on one of the songs.

Overall, a fantastic show with rousing audience participation to boot.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1102377600,39,611,4.846153846153846

2168116,2,B00064VR0W,"Ridiculous, over the top silliness from an aging Rod. The
First half is pretty good. Then, after a intermission, Rod
returns in a tux with an orchestra singing show tunes from
the 30's with one guest after another singing his songs. Also,
Way too much audience participation. He lets the audience sing on almost every song. Not what I paid for. Do not recommend. Gave it 2 stars for all the gorgeous women he
trots out on the stage and in the crowd. Audio and video good as well.",1489968000,3,479,4.393258426966292
2168117,5,B00064VR0W,What a performance by Rod!  This was absolutely terrific; just like seeing him in person.  It was great how he switched it up and sang some of the old classics too.  Rod will always be in our hearts and in our souls........,1489104000,2,223,4.261904761904762

2168119,1,B00064VR0W,"I was SO disappointed with this concert.  All of the great songs are here, but they are completely ruined by Rod's unfortunate and inexplicable obsession with having the audience sing lengthy and painfully inane-sounding portions of most of the songs, instead of actually singing them himself, as anyone buying a concert dvd would assume that he would do.  Long portions of Maggie May, Reason to Believe, and You're In My Heart were absolutely unbearable.  If you get a thrill out of hearing a bunch of dorky, talentless fans singing classic songs, making them sound like a particularly lame and unsatisfying junior high school pep rally, then, by all means, buy this dvd.  Otherwise, don't waste your hard-earned money.  Word to Rod:  If you don't have enough wind in your sails or enough stamina beneath your Scotish kilt to do a decent show, stop selling tickets.  (It's called a tread mill.  Look into it.)",1488758400,,910,4.901960784313726

His wardrobe changes including a tux and tails in which he performs a number of classic standards that do not disappoint. The crowd is also very into the show which makes it more enjoyable. There are also a couple of surprises, like Ronnie Wood and a ""busker"" named Amy Bell who sings like an angel. Get this for your collection.",1407628800,4,477,4.370786516853933

The final overcome could not be better.

And finally you will realize how the audience loves and admires him, spelling with and joining him in several themes of undisputed level.

2168298,5,B00064VR0W,"Rod Stewart's ""One Night Only: Live At The Royal Albert Hall"" is one fabulous and remarkable concert. Imagine a venue that caters to famous and legendary singers, one of them was an icon of a singer Frank Sinatra. This stunning concert is a showcase of Rod Stewart's big hits as ROD THE MOD, and his bestselling Great American Songbook series as ROD THE FAB (the title I coined - short for fabulous interpreter of the Great American Songbook). He describes his GAS: Volume I as ""an album that calms you down."" He added that recording it was a great challenge and he was so thrilled with the outcome. According to him, ""it's so impossible for him to run out of these songs from the Great American Songbook."" He further states that he ""could probably make six albums of these songs quite easily."" He already made four volumes, which are all bestsellers. I only hope that there would be an upcoming Volume V. It's a common knowledge that he truly enjoyed this experience so much and understands how much it means to him and to his fans as well. And he also wants it to always remain something special. The Songbook albums have meant a great deal to him and thinks that singing these songs has made him a better singer one can only hope.

I must admit that I only became a fan of Rod the Fab when he recorded the standards from the Great American Songbook, though there were occasional hits he sung that really appeal to me like ""Reason To Believe,"" ""I Don't Want To Talk About It"" and ""You're In My Heart."" I've watched one of his earliest television interviews with Katie Couric while promoting his GAS series. Ms. Couric asked him why he ""doesn't look his age."" I guess he was sixty then, and he declared that some of his ""secrets of looking young are . . . lots of music, wine and soccer.""

His performances are in every way sparkling and dazzling as the brightest evening star, and so electrifying as lightning! He has the backing of a large orchestra and well-rehearsed musicians to make this concert the greatest gig of the year! He shares some interesting anecdotes, one of which is about his first guitar. His Dad gave him a guitar for no apparent reason and told him: ""Why don't you take this up, there's money in this."" And the rest, of course, is history.

While I'm thoroughly delighted with the concert in its entirety, my favorite parts are all his performances on the Great American Songbook. On these presentations, the London-born singer looking so dapper in his pinstriped outfit brings new life to these chestnuts with his excellent showmanship and his fabulous stage presence.

My highlights:
""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" - beautiful sax solo by Katja.
""Blue Moon"" - the guitar solo is absolutely breathtaking!
""As Time Goes By"" - an amazing duet with Chrissie Hynde with exquisite solos on violin by Janet and sax by Katja.
""For Sentimental Reasons"" - a lovely performance.
""Reason To Believe"" - one of the most notable performances.
""I Don't Want To Talk About It"" - a duet with Amy Belle who has a very expressive voice.

There's no doubt that Rod Stewart is such a total performer and he could command your undivided attention whether you're listening to his CDs or watching his DVDs such as this one.

2168317,5,B00064VR0W,"Rod Stewart at his all time best. Fantastic back up solo musicians. One of the most poignant moments in the concert was when he announced the appearance of Amy Bell: a young lady he found ""busking"" on the streets of Glasgow. This was her first professional appearance, decending a grand staircase to the stage of The Old Albert stage to screaming fans to do a duet with the greatest rock and roller of all time! It brought tears to my eyes. I hope as a result we will be able to buy a DVD of Amy in the near future. Fabuluous.

And this DVD takes me back there. The audio & video are superb. Even after his throat surgery, Rod sounds great to me, still the ""whiskey & crushed glass"" voice I remember from way back. I'd also purchased the ""Stay with me Ronnie"" DVD, which isn't even in the same class as this DVD. Whether you are a fan of ""old Rockin' Rod"" or love the old classic tunes, this one's a keeper.",1124236800,4,550,4.247619047619048

Everyone (Friends and Family) who has seen this DVD has simply raved about the fresh new talent of Amy Belle and the way that Rod has plucked her from obscurity and put her into the spotlight of this performance.

Say what you will about Rod's gravelly voice, but the overall presentation on this DVD is superb.",1115424000,11,379,4.4
2168320,5,B00064VR0W,"Rod Stewart has been a consistently amazing live performer since the 1970s', but this concert at the Royal Albert Hall may be the single greatest performance of his career. Never have I seen such a consistently entertaining live dvd, with great sound and camera work to boot.

Featuring 17 breathtaking Rod classics, this dvd never fails to deliver. Whether he's wailing his way through to ""Stay With Me"", pouring his heart into ""You're In My Heart"", crooning out the timeless ""American Songbook"" tracks or showing his tender side on ""I Don't Wanna Talk About It"" (sung with a brand new singing talent discocvered by Rod, Amy Belle).

The whole dvd is a highlight as a whole, but forced to pick one performance as the dvd's high point, I would have to go for ""Hot Legs"". Rod just rocks the hell out of this one, proving that even at 60 he still hasn't lost his youthful energy. My only wish is that he performed ""Some Guys Have All The Luck"" and ""Addicted To Love"" separately. They're great as a medley, but I feel they'd work even better on their own.

Overall, a stunning live performance that only a performer like Rod can provide. My advice is to go out and buy this amazing dvd.",1112400000,32,1183,4.544600938967136
2168321,5,B00064VR0W,"Others have described the details of the show so I won't bore you except to say that if you're a Rod fan, especially one like me who's loved his work for (groan) over 35 years, I'll just say that... THIS ONE'S GONNA FLOOR YA. Just a fabulous performance (and for once, consistently great camerawork and great editing.) But I do want to tell you about one song, one very special moment. As we know, late one night a thousand years ago Long John Baldry discovered Rod as he was singing in a lonely train station, and took him under his wing. Rod's returned the favour big time. Imagine if you will being a very young woman busking on the streets of Glasgow... and one week later descending a beautifully lit grand staircase to the stage of the Royal Albert Hall to sing ""I Don't Wanna Talk About It"" on live national TV with Rod Stewart. God, how this girl keeps it together is beyond me, but she does, she in fact KILLS. It's an exquisitely beautiful, deeply moving, very human moment. A great moment of artistic generosity on Rod's part, and a lump-in-the-throat moment for the viewer as Amy Belle experiences what must have been the peak moment of her life. It's unforgettable, and there wasn't a dry eye in this house I can promise you. Oh, and any Rod fan who's hesitant about this American Songbook stuff, not to worry, his performance of these old chestnuts is fabulous, as though they'd been written for him or by him. And the final number, ""Sailing,"" is a knockout. I think this DVD simply backs up what I've always maintained, which is that Rod is the greatest solo act of our generation. Rod, if you're reading this, a million thanks for all the pleasure over five decades, all the unforgettable shows, from a little kid from the Boston Tea Party...",1108512000,128,1758,4.531446540880503
2168322,3,B00064VR0W,"There is a moment in this DVD, during ""Reason to Believe"" when Rod Stewart takes the mic and growls ""Knowing that you lied--straight faced while I cried!""  What make it special is that the singer uses that great death howl that you can feel right in your very soul. It is what has made Rod Stewart a huge star and one of many things that has made him a tremendously exciting live performer. The problem is, that after his throat surgery four years ago, that growl is rarely heard in concert anymore. Ever since the surgery, Rod sings all uptempo numbers from Maggie to Hot Legs as if he's afraid to cut loose, like he may do further damage to the pipes. He still has it --you can hear it on certain numbers but more often than not, Stewart has adopted a ""wimpy"" style of singing that disappoints those of us who remember the pre-surgery live Rod. One does not notice it on the ballads as much (though some of them sound weak as well when he wimps out.) so he can still get away with the Great American Songbook.

However, that major complaint aside, those of us who have made ROD STEWART a second religon, are willing to forgive the old boy almost anything--after all, he's entertained us so long and so well, how could we not?-- and the Stewart charm is so prevelant throughout this concert, that it's STILL enjoyable. It's almost like ROD STEWART ON ICE--A CELEBRATION of a career, not quite a rock concert in the sense of what Rod could do just five or six years ago, but still a rock-like spectacle produced by a lovable rogue who has survived so much that I would imagine anyone willing to give Rod the benefit of the doubt, will give into the irrepressible wit and charisma and enjoy this show. ALSO--Rod has once again, as he has for the past 20 years or so, surrounded himself with fantastic musicians--and all of them are showcased here. They are not the Faces of course, but they aren't meant to be.  (Plus you get to see his current way-too-young-for-him blonde--Penny Lancaster--prance around in a Scottish plaid mini skirt, threatening to play the bagpipes. At 6'1 and drop dead gorgeous, it's worth the price of the DVD alone. wink wink.)

SO--Rod fans will love it, it is currently the best Rod live DVD available (much better than the bloodless, joyless Songbook DVD and more complete than the great Storytellers show) but this will not gain Rod any new converts. For that we will need a multi-disc set that chronicles Rod Stewart at his peak as a live performer, from his days with the Faces in the early 70s to 1998's great ""New Boys"" tour.",1104019200,37,2558,4.518358531317495

The venue is absolutely perfect.  The crowd is in to this concert 100 percent.  I've never written a revue before, but I noticed there were no customer reviews and I just have to tell everyone that they won't be sorry for purchasing this concert. It's worth every penny.  Even people who aren't Rod Stewart fans will love this.",1103587200,13,451,4.451219512195122

8038590,5,B00064VR0W,"Really an excellent concert video, combining Stewart's traditional rock hits with his more recent American Songbook work.  Tough combination, but he did it well, especially in a very challenging environment.  The Royal Albert Hall doesn't really lend itself to a let-it-all-go attitude among its audiences, but Stewart got things loosened up a bit.  Guest performers were great too.  Highly recommended!",1521504000,,403,5.666666666666667
