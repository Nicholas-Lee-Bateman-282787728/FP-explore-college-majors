I am a very experienced painter, and I am thrilled to find how much new information is presented here. Ms. Lilliedahl really knows what she's doing, and you are taught with precise, thorough lessons how to re-create this beautiful Waterhouse painting. She teaches you the technique that Waterhouse himself used, and it is simply revolutionary to me. She shows how to use transparent glazes and opaque colors together, for jaw-droppingly beautiful effects. This woman gives you PLENTY of explanation as to why and how she does everything, exactly how to use your paints, etc. Her voice is clear and easy to understand (so important for folks like me).

The information on how to create realistic flesh and give it life-like volume is simply invaluable. Lips, eyes, hair...I learned so much!

I really cannot think of a single thing that is missing from this video. You get a sketch included that can be enlarged, or one could even work small as a ""practice"" painting. You also get a little ""recipe booklet"" that tells you every color you will need, and how to mix them just as she does. There are two discs, so this is not a slam-bang ""Happy Little Trees"" kind of thing. Once an artist follows along with this video, they will have a far better understanding of how oils behave, and how to get them to ""look the way you want"".

I would highly recommend this for intermediate or experienced oil painters. Even acrylic painters would benefit, especially if they use glazes and mediums. This would be an AMAZING Christmas gift for an artist. I cannot wait to set up my easel!",1380499200,,1799,4.6125
