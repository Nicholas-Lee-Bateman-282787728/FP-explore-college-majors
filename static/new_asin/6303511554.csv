8172480,4,6303511554,"Let's face it. Men hate woman. It's becoming more obvious everyday. Men hate the idea of a woman as an equal who is capable of bad A**ery. Remember elementary? Most guys start out with that Little Rascals Mentality on girls & it only shortens 2 degree's after puberty. Go Figure.

Any film that displays woman of power who are capable of power moves such as Lena Olin in Romeo Is Bleeding, America Olivo in Bitch Slap. People can't appreciate the pure awesomeness of Britt Robertson who's 1 of the bravest teen actors. I mean how many teens get high, drunk & start fights in films yet still get's a Disney TV film & why'll we're on the subject where is Avalon High on DVD?

Yes Sexism is still very prevelent. Movies like Hay Wire & Columbiana are trashed mearly for being action films starring woman. Comic fans can look at the sexism & lack or respect for Wonder Woman by it's own company. Sure she get's failed pilots. Sure we could expect some sexim from a feminist perspective. But not a male's perspective.

Men luv weak willed men possessed woman like Taylor Swift who's whole life & happiness rest on the shoulder's of a man. Hard 2 imagine how she'll take her life when she 1 day comes home 2 her husband in bed with another woman.

So Once again a film decides 2 give woman some power & show them doing some bad A**ness & the critics castrate it. Go figure really.

This film isn't perfect. Stephen Baldwin surly isn't the best lead actor. I'm not a big fan & unlike what other reviewers say. This isn't strickly for his fans.

This is for for fans of powerful woman getting over on ignorant men.

I mean look at the charrecter. He's wierd, Troubled by some past with his dad. He's quick 2 slap 1 girl & shoot another. SO who really cares when they get over on him? I certainly don't. It's not the slightest sad like Matt Dillon at the end of Employee Of The Month. Nope it's great & statisfly.

This is a real good feminist noir. Girls probablly won't like the idea 2 girls sleeping with Stephen Baldwin though they might of forgave it if it was Alec. Bur they'll luv the ending as I did.

People have poked fun of the director. But honestly I found this film very stylish. Weird 2 think I merely IMDB searched some odd keywords. Mainly neo-noir & lesbianism & came up with this flick. I wasn't sold at first. But I enormously enjoyed it. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of lead actor. Because of him this film is only an A. But with a better actor it could've been an A Plus. Then again a better actor would've probably made you sympathies for him 2 much & thous hate the ending. So maybe this film's star does work after all.

As for plausibility. Allotta noirs border it. But anyone especially 2 hot girls can do anything they put their mind 2 as long as there is passion.

So for fans of Romeo Is Bleeding, Palmetto, The Salton Sea & other good noirs of desperate people doing desperate things for desperate reasons. This film is for them. Fans of woman. I'm sure there are some out there will luv it 2.

I pray for the day more noirs like this get made.",1358294400,,3081,4.320623916811092
