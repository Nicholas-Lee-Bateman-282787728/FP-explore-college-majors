4903997,2,B005XQV0CS,"Saw this on demand - read a couple of favorable reviews on imdb but I thought this was a terrible movie - cliched characters, dialogue and plot.  Just my two cents.",1278892800,5,164,4.290322580645161
4903998,5,B005XQV0CS,"Excellent movie. Very real. Has that independent film feel, so if thats not your thing, nor is true love... Then you may not enjoy it as much.",1380672000,3,142,4.296296296296297
4903999,4,B005XQV0CS,"I was surprised by the film - I have only seen Scott Caan's work in his bigger Hollywood productions in which he kind of plays shades of the same character.  Here you see a different side of him, with a level of vulnerability that is credible and not overplayed.  Two of the scenes with James Caan stood out as really powerful. The supporting cast showed up and came to play. Dylan McDermitt and Erika Christensen stood out with fun and engaging performances.  In terms of the story, it was well written, well paced, and kept my attention throughout.  Was it predictable? Yes, although there was a pretty good misdirect in the film. I hope we get to see more of this kind of work from Scott Caan.",1374969600,4,696,4.456692913385827
4904000,5,B005XQV0CS,"Very emotional, pulls you in.  As a Scott Caan fan I would recommend it to anyone. This shows that he is a very talented actor.",1366156800,3,127,4.08
4904001,1,B005XQV0CS,"This DVD  would not play on my DVD player,  Caused the whole system to lock up.  Costs more to ship it back than the DVD is worth.",1359158400,,130,3.740740740740741
4904002,5,B005XQV0CS,"Mercy took me by surprise.  I enjoyed the twist of a familiar story of a jaded man, a romance author in this case, who actually finds love in his best critic.  I found the movie believable and sincere despite others' more skeptical reviews concerning the ending.  The editing was well done, aiding in the viewer's suspensful realization of an ending that the characters already know.  The movies begins at the end and whirls around the viewer, dropping hints and building the characters as the storyline progresses.  Unlike some who like to guess endings as a movie begins, I like surprises and prefer to let a movie (or book, play, etc) take me there, which may be why I enjoyed it much more than those who rated the movie poorly.",1342915200,3,731,4.635658914728682
4904003,1,B005XQV0CS,this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen - about a tough guy who is about 5 foot 4 - no plot ;no drama - yuchhh - stay away ;far far away from this turkey,1315440000,3,169,3.358974358974359
4904004,5,B005XQV0CS,"There are few times in my life anymore that I find myself touched deeply on very basic and guttural level by movies or television. That I remain impacted hours, days and weeks later. It's been a very, very long time since something has captured my interest so keenly that I sat glued to my television as it played out before me. Since something has made me incapable of looking away, wondering about what seemed at first to be a lovely romance story, but turned into a tale that took my breath away.

""Mercy"" did just that.

The no-nonsense realism and exploration of human relationships is refreshing and honest. Whether examining what happens between father and son, male friends who are quite different from one another, or men and women in both sex and relationships, Scott Caan manages to weave it all together so we care about these people. To say it's a character study is almost beneath the quality of both writing and acting in this film.

There is much more to say, but to do so would be to expose too much of what made this a truly unforgettable foray for me, not into Hollywood magic...but into the very soul of men. I truly hope Mr. Caan's work on ""Hawaii Five-O"" will not keep him from making more of his brand of magic...from giving us his smile, his laughter, his tears and his beautiful ability to write in such a way it's likely to sneak up and sucker-punch you right where it counts.

I highly recommend you see ""Mercy."" You'll come out of it maybe with a few tears, but you'll also be a better person for your efforts.",1310428800,7,1538,4.482142857142857
4904005,4,B005XQV0CS,I thought Scott Cannon (Danny Willaims on Hawwia 5-0)did an amazing job in this movie. Sure at times it was sad but still very good. It was nice to see him as a lead actor in a movie and not just as a supporting cast. I bought this movie and Im so happy I did. I would watch it again. It was also good seeing Ericka Chirisetein (Parenthood)in something new. If you like Scott Cannon as much as me I think you would enjoy this movie.,1303689600,3,432,4.034883720930233
4904006,5,B005XQV0CS,"I was fascinated by this movie. If you look at it deeply, there are some thought-provoking themes and ideas running through it. I thought the artistic crafting was impressive, too. I liked that John Ryan didn't have a perfect life. Rather, he struggled with challenges that many of us face and reacted like a true human, succeeding, then falling back, then struggling forward a little more. Like real life, not a pat 2-hour solution in which the hero overcomes. I like real people.",1302220800,7,481,4.807228915662651
4904007,4,B005XQV0CS,"As far as plot goes, this one is a little melodramatic and cliched, but the cast is so fantastic that it still makes the movie worth watching. Scott Caan especially created a very likable, earnest leading man, and Troy Garity is equally enjoyable. I found the love story to be a little hokey, but for this movie it is more of a means to the end for Johnny's (Caan) maturity.",1301443200,4,374,4.357142857142857
8488889,2,B005XQV0CS,"starring, produced and written by scott caan.  great scott he's not.  not yet, anyway. two of the cast members are james caan and Dylan McDermott.  james caan had no role to act and mr. McDermott's juiciest scene was deleted from the film.  as the star scott caan could have afforded himself some less dullards to work off of.  such boring chatter I could only hope aliens would crash into the non-action.  no such luck.  most noticeable in the film was not the camerawork or scenery, but the casting of women with large beautiful teeth.",1527379200,,537,4.648936170212766
8488890,5,B005XQV0CS,"Saw this on cable. Filmed, written, and acted beautifully. Scott Caan is awesome. James is good too. I enjoyed this film. It really nails the emotions of finding love and losing love, and the value of friendship. It had the feeling of a 1970s movie but modern in 2009.",1513296000,,268,4.489795918367347
8488891,5,B005XQV0CS,"I watched this movie online previously and finally just had to purchase an actual copy for myself.  I actually have to prepare myself to watch it again as it really gets to me on an emotional level.  The way the film is edited jarred and confused me a bit at first but then I realized what was happening and why...and it all fell into place.  It worked.  Beautiful, heartbreaking story about relationships and how people have the power to impact and change each other's lives.  A quiet movie where the story really circles around the character of Johnny Ryan...and Scott Caan shines in this role.  When he gets to sink his teeth into a character, he can really take it places.  Oh, and James Caan playing his dad (the professor)?  I've worked on a college campus forever and I've KNOWN a few professors that could've been the role model for this character!",1506038400,,856,4.5855263157894735

8488896,5,B005XQV0CS,"Loved the movie!  The story is told in with a unique timeline that challenges the viewer to pay attention as the story unfolds.  I would highly recommend viewing the film once through and then viewing it again with the commentary.  Very insightful.  Kudos to Scott Caan taking on the challenge of writing, producing and starring in this film and bringing together all of the other talented people involved.",1438041600,,406,4.926470588235294
8488897,5,B005XQV0CS,I really enjoyed this film.  I didn't know what to expect and it really spoke to me.  Suffice it to say that I had a personal experience that vastly impacted me years ago and this film was able to capture a lot of my feelings both at the time of that experience and subsequent to it.  I highly recommend this film.,1395619200,,314,4.114754098360656
