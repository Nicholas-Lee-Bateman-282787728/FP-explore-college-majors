8143198,2,B000I2ISP4,"Bleak Future: 4 out of 10: I have had friends that would constantly quote their favorite movies (In particular Caddyshack.) and one of the sources of these quotes was that vast work of Monty Python. The Python oeuvre is so influential it has spawned its own adjective Pythonesque. Bleak Future is often a Pythonesque movie. Unfortunately sometimes it borrows a little too much.

It consists of chapters broken up by a video on how the world ended. (The video is a definite nod to The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy but it is so well done and entertaining I didn't care.) The chapters however are another story.

Filmed in super-8 in a desert wasteland they are a spot on parody of all those mindless post-apocalyptic movies of the last thirty years. These scenes consist of three main characters, a mute Scotsman warrior with a Billy Baldwin haircut, a very pretty blond girl without an original thought in her head, and that guy who won't stop doing those Monty Python impressions.

It's the third guy known as Slangman that gave me fits. His shtick is on display throughout the entire film and it drove me to distraction almost immediately. Every other character is fine. Sure some of the jokes are flat and overdone and there is a scene with the mutants so derivative of Python I thought they were going to ask for a shrubbery, but it is Slangman whose every utterance became the nails on my chalkboard soul.

Other than the small fact that the main character, who is in every scene, is a complete tool this is a fairly entertaining film with a genuinely funny ending. Worth a look if you are a fan of post apocalyptic movies just beware of the mutants that say Nee.",1255996800,2,1670,4.6127946127946124
8143199,4,B000I2ISP4,"Let's get this straight first.  This is not the kind of movie you can explain... only experience.  It's up there with Six String Samurai for tone and setting... but with it's own wildly vibrant imagination.

Sure... it's low budget, but it works.  Don't expect anything you'd catch at an Oscar ceremony here... but if you dig cult movies... the kind you drive 50 miles out of your way to see at an art cinema or late night showing... you'll love this.  Weird, violent, funny, disgusting... a must for fans of mutants, post apocalyptic landscapes, and the Meaning of Life.  (Python pun intended)",1208131200,5,594,4.7745098039215685
8143200,1,B000I2ISP4,"This movie makes no sense at all. The characters, plot and movie itself are some of the dumbest things Ive ever seen. Do not waste your money on this peice of trash.",1202774400,,165,4.1875
8143201,5,B000I2ISP4,"I really like this movie.  Good comedy, and lots of gore.  It's like apple pie and cheese...or something like that.",1164240000,,115,4.7
