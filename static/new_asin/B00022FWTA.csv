2056259,4,B00022FWTA,"When I saw this movie I wasn't expecting it to be as entertaining as the original.  However, this movie has a solid plot for a youth spy caper and is a bit funnier than the original.  Frankie Muniz is likable as the serendipitous child CIA agent, who begins the film at CIA summer camp.  After the camp director turns out to be a rogue agent who has stolen mind control technology Cody is sent to London to help catch the rogue agent and stop the devious plans that have been made to use the mind control technology to gain control of world leaders.  Seeing dignitaries (including the Queen of England character) dancing to the tune of ""War...what is it Good For?"" at a ""G7"" event is amusing, and Cody's CIA ""handler"" posing as a bumbling chef specializing in Southern cuisine is also suited to this type of movie.  I'm still trying to figure out when Cody's parents will discover he is really a spy - I guess that humorous plot device can be recycled in Cody Banks 3.  Well, anyway, this is a fun, fast-paced movie that can entertain children and adults.",1087689600,7,1055,4.46875
2056260,5,B00022FWTA,"I saw Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London in theaters. From what I had seen in the previews, I was expecting to be at least as good as, if not better than, the first one. When the movie was over, I was very satisfied. It was just as good as the first one. It would have been much better if they had cut out the scene with the crazy guy who was supplying Cody's gadgets. Other than that, I give it two thumbs up. I can hardly wait until it comes out on DVD!!!",1085184000,8,461,3.9148936170212765
2056261,3,B00022FWTA,Excellent! I enjoyed this movie just as much as the first one. Frankie Muniz does another great performance playing the 16 year old CIA Agent. There are also some new faces in this film. In this film Cody has to go to London to stop a mind control system from taking over the world. So he goes undercover as a new student going to a school for music in London. There is a lot of action and suspense. It actually is more funny then the first movie. Anthony Anderson plays Cody's handler in this film and he is hilarious. Also S Club 7 star Hannah Sperritt plays a student at the school who is actually undercover herself. I recommend that all kids go see this movie with their parents because their parents will enjoy this film also. The action in this movie is awesome. Some effects are pretty cool. I hope they make more Agent Cody Banks movies because I think they are great family movies!!!! This movie is a movie everyone should definitely own so they can watch it over and over again for years to come!,1084838400,5,1007,4.361702127659575
2056262,4,B00022FWTA,"Frankie Muniz returns as the teenage CIA super-secret operative in ""Agent Cody Banks 2:  Destination London.""
THE STORY:
CIA teen operative Cody Banks is called back into action to head to England undercover as a musical prodigy to stop a mad scientist and a CIA turncoat from unleashing an all-powerful mind control technology on the world's leaders at the World Summit.
THE COOL THINGS:
Again, if you're into cool spy movies full of action, cool weapons and gadgets, you'll love the next installment in the Cody Banks series.  All the charm from the first movie and similar movies in the genre (a la Spy Kids) are here in this film.
Anthony Anderson's role as Bank's ""handler"" for this film was also a solid cast as he added much more comic relief to this year's film.  ""Uncle Compton.""  HA!!!!
THE CRITICISMS:
The film did lose a bit of a step from last year's original in terms of story pacing though.  The scenes with Bank's family were filler at best and seemed to be a bit thrown in.  Also, the ""romance"" between Bank's and his counterpart this year was just waaay below the ""cutesy"" romance he shared with the Hilary Duff character last year.  So if you're into the films for the ""Banks Girl"" intrigue you'll be disappointed.  However, possibilities are left open as this year's British girl character is a counterpart to Cody Banks in more ways than one.
BEST SCENES:
1. Raid at Camp Woody
2. Spying Down the Chimney
3. Bottled Water Battle
4. The Final Battle scenes
THE VERDICT:
Perfectly good and acceptable family fun.  It's definitely worth the check-out if you're into these type of films.
Final Grade:  4/5
Recommended",1080518400,10,1634,4.742049469964664
2056263,4,B00022FWTA,"...or is London ready for Agent Cody Banks? After tackling his domestic American homeland with sheer machoism and a dedicated bravery, Agent Banks (Frankie Muniz) is off on another dangerously exciting adventure, except this installment takes place in jolly old London. Agent Banks, with an endless arsenal of gadgets in hand, must take on a madman head-to head, who's intent is to control the world's monetary supply through means of an orally-implanted microchip, which makes robots out of humans. Banks is sent to London in the guise of a music student, so as not to blow any sort of cover as a CIA spy. The film's formulaic plot tends to work for the most part, although it exudes clumsiness and silliness in places, as to how Banks' nemises are going to install EVERY microchip into BILLIONS of citizens', including some 200+ world leaders' brains. That's A LOT of people to operate on a person-to-person basis! Hannah Spearritt, as Frankie Muniz's co-star and British-agent-extraordinare Emily, although not Angie Harmon, is able to take matters into her own hands, while putting in a noble performance all the while. She really knows how to put the bad guys in their place, so don't mess with her! Yes, ""Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London"" almost has it all (despite a minor display of nonsensical nuances). Amongst the good things it has: arsenal (gadgets), architecture, arch-rivals, even an A-bomb-type exploding candy! ""ACB2:DL"" even boasts a heapin' helpin' of soul food. Hmm, grits and chitlins...ON BRITISH SOIL?!!? Verrry interrresting, and obnoxiously strange to boot! Are you all packed and ready for take-off yet? Your airline ticket (and passport)'s waiting just for you at your local theater. Be sure and claim them today!",1079308800,5,1746,5.108391608391608
2056264,5,B00022FWTA,"Well, I must admit that I don't really  go for these kinds of movies, however, I really enjoyed the first one, so naturally, I had to drag my freinds kicking and screaming ( not that I cared, guyes) To see the second.  I absolutely loved it!  I will agree with the other reviewer that the beginning could have been better, but I could not stop laughing!  It was very funny and very intense!  Frankie Muniz (as always) was wonderful and the supporting cast was great!  I'm glad to see that there is at least one truely great young talent out there!  So, keep up the good work Frankie! :)",1079222400,5,586,4.321100917431193

Hannah Spearritt has a paltry role that seems mainly to serve the purpose of having a pretty girl in the movie.

2056439,2,B00022FWTA,"I liked the idea of the half-pint James Bond-like secret agent  played by Frankie Muniz aka 'Agent Cody Banks.'  The story is not exceptionally original, but Muniz, a decent actor I suppose, carried the whole film pretty well, which was enjoyable to see.

Now, finally I saw the sequel, which turned out a big disappointment.  First, you realize that everything is missing from the sequel, I mean, everything that made the original film quite a unique one.  Here, 'Cody' is no longer timid or feels intimidated before women; he just acts like an ordinary American teenager, but this time he is in London!  That's all, and Cody is assigned a job to retrieve the high-tech mind-control device that might be used to control the world's leaders at G7 (or G8 ... whatever).  But ... why do they need special agent Cody instead of ordinary spy like James Bond or any spies you can name?

Because Cody has to get close to the prime suspect, who owns a boarding school, where Cody must be placed.  And for the successful mission, Cody must not disclose his identity before the kids (who wouldn't believe such nonsense anyway).  My question: Do you believe in this poorly written plot, or, more to the point, DO you care?

If you should care, that's because of romance.  In the sequel, you see no Hilary Duff, who was not bad in the first film.  Instead, you get Hannah Spearritt (ex 'S-Club'), but between Muniz and her there is no chemistry.  Add to that, the gadgets are unimaginative ones; the locations are all shot like post-cards.  Side kick Anthony Anderson is same old Anthony Anderson, who is certainly funny, but we know he could be much more funny with better materials, better than doing unfunny slapsticks in the kitchen.

I read that the film's script was being written during the shooting.  What were they thinking?  Did director Kevin Allen approve that?  Did MGM need the sequel that desperately?  Or quickly?  Because Frankie Muniz was reaching the age of 20, no longer a 'teenager,' no 'Cody Banks'?  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure that as far as the script is concerned, the film is a very lazy, unfunny, unexciting comedy of which sole merit is that it was shot in London.  But sooner or later you can see London in another film.",1120694400,,2245,4.656488549618321
2056440,1,B00022FWTA,"I will admit, I was a fan of the first film.  While I didn't think it was one of the greatest films created, I did think that it had quite a bit of potential coupled with ample originality.  It was fun, exciting, and it seemed like everyone involved seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I only with that I could say the same for the sequel, Agent Cody Banks: Destination London.  From the opening sequence of this film you could sense an aura of dislike, repetitiveness, and simple futility.  Nobody, not even Frankie Muniz himself, seemed like they were bringing the same level of excitement to this project.  Also, the level of originality was completely below par for this sequel.  If you, like myself, brought any excitement from the first film to this one, it will be completely destroyed.  Nothing worked in this movie, from the jokes, to the ""spy"" story, it just seemed flat and disrespectful.

My first issue is with the cast.  If this was a true sequel, I think the producers could have budgeted a bit more to see about getting the original characters back.  I understand that perhaps Hillary Duff's paycheck had risen since the original film, but she did bring something (as embarrassing as it is to say) to Agent Cody Banks that kept the spark alive.  As did everyone else involved, sadly, Anthony Anderson (one of the most overused comic actors of this decade) brought nothing to the table.  His jokes seemed generic and, honestly, repetitive.  He had no character, all I could witness was Anthony Anderson being Anthony Anderson.  They attempted to bring sympathy to his character by giving him this sub-story about being the ""black"" sheep of the CIA, but in my eyes it just wasn't enough.  Anderson was just trying to showcase his ""talent"" so that he can continue to live the lifestyle that he has built.  It was sad, and really hurt this film.  Second, was Muniz himself.  The bond between him and Hannah Spearritt was poor.  I am not sure who the casting agent was on this project, but there was no chemistry between these two actors.  They continued to prove that by reading your lines and walking the steps, you could inherit a $5 million dollar paycheck.  Nobody cared, nobody stopped, they just continued to make this cheapened sequel.

Next issue, where was the story?  The first film carried with it some decent events that built a strong story which ultimately lead to a better than average film, but it seemed like in this sequel they aimed towards children and empty minds.  In most film sequels, they use a similar plot structure to give the audience a sensation of relaxation, while simultaneously building different elements to keep our attention.  Well, none of that was used in this film.  Instead, we find ourselves with a cheapened story that results in dogs playing piano and a very unspooky villain.  In fact, I couldn't even tell you who the true bad guy was of this film, and that is a perfect sign that your film is struggling.  This story just felt as if it was unfinished, as if the original screenplay was not dumbened down for children, but instead built another strong adventure, but the studio wanted to capture the child audience, so the butchered the product, leaving frayed edges and unfinished segments, so that they could make room for Anthony Anderson's cheap laughs.  Yet again, proving the pathetic nature of the film.  I went into this story expecting to be completely surprised, yet somehow walked away without any recollection of what I just experienced.  It was the perfect example of a how a sequel should not be structured or released.

Finally, I would like to say that if you have a film that seems to do somewhat well at the box office, there should be no need to rush right into a sequel, especially if you see a growing decrease in the excitement behind Malcolm in the Middle.  Frankie Muniz is a decent actor, but when handed poor material, he will not fray from making it exceptionally poor.  He is one of those actors that brings good things to great material, but will falter if handed unseasonable stuff.  I do not see a bright future for Muniz due to his ability to stray from decency.  This could have been a powerful sequel, but instead Hollywood yet again strayed towards the side of childish behavior instead of truthful storytelling.

Overall, this film lacked the fun of the first film.  With unfamiliar characters, comedy that seemed forced and incoherent instead of funny, and a story that had that cheapened Velcro feel to it, Agent Cody Banks 2 proved that jumping to quickly into a sequel will place a black cloud on your entire series.  While once I had considered this to be an interesting and highly original concept, I now have second thoughts.  I am not sure that Muniz was prepared for such a cheap sequel, and therefore he signed too quickly.  I do not recommend this film to anyone that enjoyed the first film, or at least was under the impression that the first film was decent.  This was a horrible sequel that should have never seen the light of day.  YUK!

2056442,2,B00022FWTA,"""Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London"" is the sequel to a film that I confess I've never actually seen.  Based on what I HAVE seen here, I'm not sure I missed all that much the first time around.

For those unfamiliar with the premise, Banks is an under-aged spy who works for the CIA, sort of a teenaged James Bond for the Doogie Howser set.  In this installment in the series, the organization sends Banks on an undercover mission to England to seek out and destroy a mind control machine that one of its rogue agents (who's feeling unappreciated and slighted by the agency) is now helping to develop and finance for his own nefarious purposes.

This is harmless enough wish-fulfillment fantasy for youngsters, I suppose, but adults forced to sit through it with them will quickly find themselves irritated and bored by all the lowbrow shenanigans.  There's a very funny scene up front in which we see how the kids' spy training facility is converted into an innocuous summer camp to fool the parents on visiting day, but, I'm afraid, this cleverness soon gives way to an inordinately silly plot and a succession of tired chase sequences.  Although the gadgets are cool, there aren't enough of them to distract us from the appalling overacting on the part of virtually the entire cast, including Frankie Muniz who, though a likable young performer on ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" is here forced to wear a single expression of pained disbelief throughout.  As an actor of undeniable talent and charm, hopefully he'll get the opportunity to tackle more varied and mature roles in the near future and won`t go the way of so many other juvenile performers - that of being stuck in roles for which he is too old and thus failing to make that successful leap from child star to adult actor.",1110240000,,1784,4.717041800643087

One aspect I didn't like in this sequel are the numerous racial insults and stereotypes in the film ranging from a middle eastern with a bad accent to a black Muslim who plays a trumpet!! Man I don't know how this on screen, it also explains why Roger Ebert gave this film a thumbs down.

Still if you like dumb entertainment check it out.

PS: Speaking of dumb racial stereotypes that girl who plays the blonde dumb bimbo who belives the lies of Cody is a near riot, at the expense of dumb blonde stereotypes.

A few laughs yes, but is the movie good? No.",1097625600,,929,4.316091954022989
2056445,1,B00022FWTA,"A few months ago Frankie Muniz appeared on 60 minutes. I didn't really have an opinion about him at all until I saw that story on him and his success.

As I was watching, I couldn't believe the utter arrogance of this 18 year old kid. The pride in himself was unending. He praised himself and claimed to be on the verge of being a huge star. There were no boundaries for him. Not once did he thank ANYBODY for helping him get to where he was, other than himself. Not even his family.

Well, I'll tell you what, Frankie Muniz would be absolutely nowhere if it weren't for the WRITERS of ""Malcolm in the Middle"". The key to Muniz's success was that he was a normal looking kid with a hint of dorkiness and whole lot of luck... then the writers and directors for the show did their magic.

Agent Cody Banks 2 is pointless and more importantly, a movie that strokes the ego of an actor that needs no more ego stroking.

The movie is poorly thought out, unfunny, and an obvious attempt at a hurry up and capitalize off of the flash in the pan success that is Frankie Muniz. No script. No thought. Ridiculous scenes that have our SUPEREGO star singing ""War! What is it Good for?"" at a world leaders meeting. The Queen of England dancing doing a shameful boogie.

This movie will most certainly send Muniz back to where he belongs. Mediocrity. Assuring him a career in a T.V. movie here and there and a guest spot on the Hollywood Squares.",1093824000,,1432,4.348314606741573
2056446,3,B00022FWTA,"I don't expect kid and family movies to be perfect or an tightly woven cinematic experience. Destination London has a few great gags to make everyone of all ages laugh. I felt it went overboard on some of the characters especially Derek, Cody's handler. The writer's could have tone him down a little bit. Anthony Anderson, who pays Derek, did a fine job.

Frankie Muniz plays the role well and doesn't act like a kid who is trying to glide through a second movie like some actors tend to do in a sequel to a successful movie. If there is a third movie, I'm all for it.

The basic plot is the leader of the ""camp,"" which is a training spot for kid spies in disguise goes rogue and heads to London with technology that can control the minds of anyone and make them do anything you want them to do. This is dangerous when you think of controlling the minds of the world leaders. Cody goes undercover as a musician, which was the most logical way for the agency to get someone ""inside.""

This is more of a 3.5 not a 3 and I just couldn't give it a 4 because I save those for very good movies and 5s for perfection. Treat it as a fun movie and you'll enjoy it.",1093132800,7,1156,4.174887892376682
2056447,4,B00022FWTA,My son Ryan and I watched this film. It's a fun film for a youngster. A child should probably be at least ten years old to understand it all. Frankie Nunoz is a very good actor as he is in Malcom in the Middle.,1090886400,,210,3.7954545454545454
2056448,5,B00022FWTA,My family (that's 10 people whose ages range from 4-40) watched this movie all together and everyone loved it. Agent Cody Banks 2 is hilarious. Cody is put undercover as a music student in London to stop a former teacher of his from using mind control to conquer the world. The action parts were really neat and although the story line itself was a little corny it was still very enjoyable.,1090540800,,390,4.507042253521127
2056449,5,B00022FWTA,"Frankie Muniz and Anthony Anderson star in this action-packed movie. In this sequel, there's a lot more humor than in Agent Cody Banks. With new slick gadgets & awesome special effects, Cody(Muniz) & Derek(Anderson) go to London to catch an evil scientist who's stolen a mind-control device for his plan to take over the world. Cody poses as a musical student who plays the clarinet; the two CIA agents team up with a British agent as they stop a madman from controlling world leaders and using them to rule the world. Plently of humor & action. Special effects include: ""Agent Mode"" Interactive Quiz, ""Spy on the Set"" Visual Cast Commentary, ""Back in Action"" Featurette, & more!",1090281600,,679,4.862068965517241

2056451,2,B00022FWTA,"The first one was cute, this is horrible. Cody's 'handler', Derek is a goofball. I would've wished they would've gotten someone else. The jokes fall flat, the villians are stupid, and the plot is worse than the first. Totally predictable with no surprise.",1089676800,,255,4.953488372093023
2056452,1,B00022FWTA,"Agent Cody Banks 2 is, with no doubt, the most useless, redundant and unasked-for sequel since WWII. No one wanted a sequel and the only reason it exists is to cash in on the modest, modest, incredibly modest 'success' of the original. The plan didn't work as this quite deservedly bombed horribly.
Even in the 2-second gap between this and the first Frankie Munitz hasn't aged well. And he's quite aggravating. Hilary Duff wisely bailed out and her character is replaced by some untalented non-celeb former pop-babe. Another sign of desperation is the casting of Anthony Anderson (who SERIOUSLY doesn't belong in this), a talented funnyman who is increasingly finding himself the ONLY funny thing and a series of bad movies.
Plus it's one of those typically xenophobic movies under the wild belief that everyone in Britain rides around on red buses, has tea with the queen every night and is either very posh or cockney. I'm sorry, but I have been on the London Eye and I KNOW the recorded female voice does not sound like that. They changed in the movie to sound 'posher'.
Unbelievable!
This is one 'franchise' that has died a quick, but painful death.",1088812800,4,1154,4.8040201005025125
