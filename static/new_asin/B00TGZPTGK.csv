7009513,5,B00TGZPTGK,"I don't need to have watched this DVD/Blu-Ray to know that it is amazing. I watched her NBC ""Bangerz Tour"" Special and was blown away by it. The production of the entire thing is amazing. From the props to the outfits to the vocals to the backdrops, everything presented in this tour looks/feels so surreal. Highly recommend pre-ordering this if you want to be blown away by the once-Disney-Princess now-SuperStar-icon known as Miley Cyrus.",1423958400,4,440,4.95945945945946

7009518,5,B00TGZPTGK,A voice and a image very different of the most singers. The talent is here and the music prove it. Great concert with lots of energy and madness. The blu-ray arrives just in time. Perfect job. Thank you. Ablio,1450224000,,209,4.384615384615385
7009519,3,B00TGZPTGK,When since do live concerts get censorship I know this was a live tv special they could of gave us the real concert on dvd/blu ray that fans pay their hard earned money to see the crazy and wild side of miley cryus and not a waterdown product edited so it's family entertianment she's not disney's hanna montana any more since it went off the air and has no reruns so kids who were into her are grown or changed . Miley came out with three  cds that were great then she wanted to be like gaga and modanna grow up into her own style of entertianment and we all know when bangers cd came out . Parents know who she was and now little kids can't buy this or go to concerts unless with an adult so this is a slap in our faces telling us enjoy the music and not the act that comes with it. Can you imagine buying censered movies no shame on rca for producing this live censored bull crap no wonder on the cover miley has her mouth open she can't believe that her fans got screwed out of a real good concert to own. three stars for the music zero for censoring and editing this.. I feel bad for miley and crew that they work hard on this and home version was nothing like the real thing and for the fans who wanted to experince this who couldn't pay to see it got robbed what a scam .,1448236800,,1278,4.011764705882353

7009531,5,B00TGZPTGK,"This Miley Cyrus Bangerz Tour Dvd is both entertaining to watch and includes songs that fit well with her free spirited concert theme.  One thing that I did enjoy about the dvd is that she did evoke a light-hearted carefree feeling throughout both the concert and her interviews. Miley Cyrus carries the love and upbeat spirit with her when she was interviewed with two of her family members. I also enjoyed that some of the members of Miley Cyruss dance entourage were interviewed for the concert dvd. There are nineteen show-stopping performances on The Miley Cyrus Bangerz Tour dvd that start out with a strong beginning with the SMS song and closes majestically with her Party In The U.S.A. performance. Adore You and Do My Thang are some of the concert productions that I enjoyed from this dvd, however there are so many more songs included that will appeal to a vast crowd even if they are unsure how they feel about some of the songs. For instance, I have truly put the painful/difficult past behind me regarding my late biological mother. However, I was unsure of how I would feel when I saw the beginning of Miley Cyruss Jolene performance due to this being my late biological mothers namesake. Much to my relief, Miley Cyrus injected such a playful and energetic performance to this song to the point where hearing the song was a better experience than I initially expected it to be. There are other songs on this dvd that Miley Cyrus turns into musically strong performances as well. Overall, Im very glad to have obtained this Miley Cyrus Bangerz dvd.",1434672000,,1563,4.725274725274725

I saw her both times she came to Chicago for the Bangerz Tour so of course I already knew what to expect. I just wanted to have this movie because the concert was so damn amazing and truly was one of the best shows I've ever been too and because well IT'S MILEY, DUH. c:
Only downfall is that its cencered. EVERYONE KNOWS THEY LOVE MILEY'S BOOTY. WE WANT THE BOOTY!!!! :b",1429056000,2,484,4.159574468085107

7009554,2,B00TGZPTGK,"It's ok but badly censored as everyone else has stated - and when ordering it nowhere did it say that it was a clean version. Also it isn't the full concert but pits of the concert inter cut with ""in private"" scenes of Miley and her siblings or ""interview"" segments. It was good to see most of the concert but some of the edits to remove the more raunchy stuff were amateurish and just bad. The bleeping out some swears then muting others is also annoying - pick one or the other. And also gotta shame Amazon for waiting until after the orders came in to then relabel the listing as censored. Bad form Amazon, bad form RCA. But hey they got their money already so why should they care about upsetting the consumers? I'm sure after a little bit more RCA will double-dip by releasing a special edition director's cut uncensored with bonus added material because $$$$.",1428883200,,865,4.481012658227848

7009559,5,B00TGZPTGK,"This is good video to own I watched it and I loved it!  I will not recommend this to little children. Because of ""SEXUAL THEMES!""

Hannah Montana was just a ""CHARACTER"" she played I will recommend this for children 16 on up! I think they will be mature enough of what's going on. If not they need to go to their parents and ask them to explain about the ""BIRDS AND THE BEES!""  Now about the ""BANGERZ TOUR!  Wonderful video of her performing her hit songs on stage changing costumes during the show!!  19 songs altogether  Like Wrecking Ball, Party In The U.S.A, FU, Jolene, and also!

I would've never ordered it if I had known it was that heavily edited and censored NBC show that I didn't like very much anyways. NBC is probably trying make back  some of the money they lost. It was the lowest rated show that night and half the shows it was up against were reruns. It should say TV-14 or TV-PG if it's something that was on network tv. I'm returning it because it's not as described on website and it's the wrong region.

I was also turned off by the sound quality (there is a huge disparity in volume between the main menu and the actual concert).  The show itself doesn't quite capture the brilliance that was the Bangerz live show, but I'm not sure any version of this DVD (edited or not) could live up to that AMAZING live show.  If you missed the real thing, it's still worth checking out.  And if you're like me and you count the Bangerz show as one of the hands down best concerts you've ever been to (and I've been to hundreds, if not thousands, of shows) this is still a fun little keepsake to commemorate the event.",1427241600,,691,4.375

No matter what people have to say about her, she has always been the most caring person I have ever seen. I have loved her since 2006 and won't ever stop loving her. The Bangerz concert was the most fun concert I have ever been to and even watching moments of it is amazing! What she does on stage is awesome and her voice is absolutely amazing! I would recommend this to everyone and anyone. Instead of judging her based on what you see or hear, take a chance and get to see her for who she truly is. She is the most down to earth person and I will always love Miley! She is truly an amazing person and has such a beautiful voice!!!

7009592,5,B00TGZPTGK,"So much can be and has been said about Miley Cyrus. Most people that criticize her are those that only judge a book by its cover. They are also the people that consider what she does ""shocking"" and cannot differentiate a stage persona from a human being. This show is not for this group of people.

I have been to hundreds of shows: my favorites being Paul McCartney in 2009 and Madonna in 2006. This show ranks high up on my list. I'm not comparing Miley to Sir Paul or Madonna because she has a long way to go to even remotely achieve what these two have but in the sense of live shows, it's ridiculously entertaining.

This show has its fair share of grinding, risque masturbatory emulation, and gaudy costumes, but the music is what ultimately makes the show great. You get the Miley staples like ""Party in the USA"" and ""We Can't Stop"" yet it is the ballads such as her cover of ""Jolene"" and her majestic hit ""Wrecking Ball"" that show why Miley has a recording contract to begin with.

No, her form of entertainment isn't for everyone, she may do things that make you cringe, and you may not agree with much of what she does in her personal life but to dismiss Miley as an entertainer is a mistake that one should not make. The Bangerz Tour was one of the most gratifying and fun shows I've ever experienced.
