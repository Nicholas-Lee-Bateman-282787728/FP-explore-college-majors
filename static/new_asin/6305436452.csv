7889671,5,6305436452,"This double feature from Roan is great.  You get both features in widescreen with great quality.  House on Haunted Hill only looks better in the Warner release.  The Bat also has an Anchor Bay edition with a trailer, but it is in full screen only.",1298073600,,247,4.444444444444445
7889672,5,6305436452,"This DVD produced by ""The Roan Group"" features two of my favorite Vincent Price horror/suspense films: ""The Bat"" and ""House On Haunted Hill"", both of which were released in movie theaters the same year (1959).

""The Bat"" is a creaky old-dark-house kind of tale, and stars Price along with the great Agnes Moorehead.  Although not exactly nail-bitingly intense, it still emits a great deal of entertainment (including several unintentionally funny moments -- or at least I *think* they're unintentional).  But, no matter.  This movie is still very fun all the way around.  And Miss Moorehead is always a treat on screen.

""House On Haunted Hill"" is a William Castle-directed feature, which automatically means a fun outing at the movies!  Castle's ""gimmick"" in movie theaters for this film was called ""Emergo"", which entailed a ""flying skeleton"" jumping out at the audience at just the proper moment in the film. Must have been pretty cool for kids back in '59!

Each film on this disc is shown in Widescreen format, with the original Mono soundtrack.  And the picture quality looks A-OK.  Very pleasing indeed (especially considering the fact neither film has been enhanced for 16x9 televisions).  Aspect Ratio for each of these black-and-white films on this DVD is 1.66:1.  The audio for each movie is 1.0 Dolby Digital (Mono).

The DVD is double-sided (therefore no disc art), with one movie residing on each side.  There are no extra bonus features at all.  But each movie does include several chapter breaks. There's a Chapter List included on a paper insert inside the DVD's Keep Case.

These two late-'50s flicks are essential viewing for any serious (or even casual) Vincent Price buff.",1085356800,5,1693,5.0359712230215825
7889673,4,6305436452,"There are no extras on this Roan DVD, not even a menu.  If you need extras, do not purchase this.  If you want see two movies that are sharp and crisp then look no further.  The sound is good.  I heard no hiss.  Both movies are interesting and well acted.",1083801600,,255,4.02

Directed by Crane Wilbur made a watchable Suspense Thriller. Price plays a Doctor here, not as Sound as House on Haunted Hill, that one was much more Better. DVD`s has a good non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.66:1) transfer and a fine Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono Sound. Grade:B.

7889675,5,6305436452,"Two fun ""Creepy old house"" flicks, from that old paragon of cheaply produced films, Allied Artists, (formerly Monogram),have been released on one DVD.  ""House on Haunted Hill"", the better-known of the two, is a now-legendary William Castle opus, full of cheap shocks, including the infamous vat of acid in a wine cellar, an unsuccessful murder plot (with a twist), campy performances, little credibility, and is a real ""party"" film. ""The Bat"", while a little on the slow side, does have Vincent Price and the wonderful Agnes Moorehead. The woman did EVERYTHING well! The story line creaks, and is a little slow-going, but I always enjoyed it-mainly due to Agnes' performance. This was another childhood favorite of mine, along with ""Haunted Hill"", which used to run on ""Million Dollar Movie"" about 100 times in one week! The picture quality is excellent on both films (you can REALLY see how cheap the sets are), and if you're 40-something like myself, it will bring back memories of a mug of hot cocoa, ""Melody"" cookies, and an old black-and-white TV set with rabbit ears.  My favorite part in ""Haunted Hill""-Carolyn Craig runs shrieking through the house (her screams could wake the dead)-Alan Marshal knocks on Vincent Price's door, and asks, ""Did you hear anything?"" to which Vincent replies, ""Organ music?""",976838400,4,1311,5.064814814814815
7889676,3,6305436452,"With DVD entering the marketplace as the latest entertainment platform, distribution companies have a new market to re-sell old products. This DVD by the Roan Group could of been a great way for fans of the horror genre or  collectors of Vincent Price's filmography to get two creaky favourites in  one....but its flawed. Not in the product. Quite the contrary, the two  films presented here have excellent picture and sound quality. The problem  is the lack of add-ons which other, newly released versions now contain.",961977600,4,519,5.070588235294117
7889677,4,6305436452,"I never saw Vincent Price Film, Expect for His Supporting Role in Dead Heat(1988). I did like House On Haunted Hill, I enjoy More Than The Bat. Good Film with Some Scares, The Film is a Bit Chessy at Times but Well  directed By William Castle, He Produced 1968 Shocker-Rosemary`s Baby.
The  Bat was Remade Three Times Before Vincent Price, Star or We can say in a  Supporting Role. This Version was Made in 1959. The Lead was Agnes  Moorehead(The Hit T.V. series-bewitched) as Novelist write about  Suspenseful Horror Book. The Bat is More Suspense Film Than A Horror Film,  Also a Mystery One, Who Is The Bat?. The House On Haunted Hill is More Of  An Film With Surprises.
Technical Information is a Mistake Is Not Dolby  Digital 2.0 Mono is Actually Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono.
The House On Haunted  Hill Real Widescreen Aspect Ratio is 1.85:1 not 1.66:1. Maybe for The Bat  but Not The House On Haunted Hill.
Roan Group did a Good Job with the  Double Feature Films. The Only Thing is Missing the Usual Traliers on Every  DVD Films. For The Bat and House On Haunted Hill. No Production Notes Also.  Actually The Picture is More Clearer With The Bat Than The House On Haunted  Hill.
Warner DVD Video Relase-The House On Haunted Hill in Pan&Scan  And Original Widescreen Format 1.85:1, Original Theatrical Tralier and  Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono. The Picture is Much Clearer and We Actually See The  String On The Skeleton, When Vincent Character is Scarying His Double  Crossing Wife To Death.
Still For Vincent Price Fans, Will Enjoy Double  Feature of These Classics Films.",957139200,5,1569,4.702205882352941
