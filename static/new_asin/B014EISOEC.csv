8730484,3,B014EISOEC,"The quality of these episodes is not as great as the American released season 1 and 2 set.  Obviously, no remaster has been done.  Also, these are only select episodes from season 3, with two from season 4 thrown in.  The languages offered are German and the original English, but most episodes have a few minutes in the beginning in which the English language is missing, so they start in German and then switch to English at about 3 minutes.  Some episodes have this happen also during the last minute, when it will switch back to German.  Still, considering SONY never released further seasons and Shout! Factory seems to me MIA when it comes to picking the rest of the series up, it is the best we'll get for now.",1458864000,,717,4.484615384615385
