1253653,3,B00002E24S,"Most of the reviews of this movie say it has a lousy plot, what few critics probably realize,however, is that it is a true story (some  liberties were taken of course.).  I am Bill Tilghman's great-great  granddaughter, and I had some problems with the story, too, mostly in what  they chose to portray.  I  think that the early days of Bill Tilghman's  life were  much more interesting than the last few months.  It's too bad  they didn't focus more on the material in the ""Passing of the Oklahoma  Outlaws"" movie that Bill made with  his partner, Benny Kent. Unless  the audience knows a lot about Bill Tilghman, they wouldn't understand the  ""flashback"" sequences.  I also think Sam Elliott was mis-cast ! I  have spoken to many living old-timers that knew Bill - they say he was a  very unassuming and quiet man.  He wasn't a tough guy at all.  Still, I was  glad the movie was made - many people never read history unless they've  seen the movie first !",967334400,56,958,4.517647058823529
1253654,2,B00002E24S,"Sam Elliott's portrait of Marshal Tilghman is splendid as ever his performances as a westerner are. But the script is really lousy. After a thrilling start sequence and a surprising film-in-film-montage the film is  lacking the necessary straightforwardness that, e.g., ""Last Stand at  Saber River"" makes a 5-star-western. There's lot of talking and too  little action. Best example: the scene when riding Tilghman is chased by a  car with gangsters. The car simply crashes downward a hill. There's no  thrilling tension in that sequence. The authors and director John Kent  Harrison were not able to turn the conflict between old-fashioned lawman  Tilghman and the modern, organised and law-protected crime into a  entertaining duel. It's a pity: A lot of good ideas and a stunning Elliott  performance wasted by uninspired filmmakers.",960940800,,836,5.369230769230769
1253655,4,B00002E24S,"I first learned of Bill Tilghman from the Wyatt Earp movies but could never find any information on him, till now. This is a TNT movie and is very well made, acted and directed. It depicts Tilghman's adventures in  Cromwell. I am not a western movie fan. But the only westerns I do enjoy  are Biopics such as this, and Clint Eastwood westerns. With the exception  of the Magnificent Seven. This is one good movie.",958953600,11,413,4.48

He made movies of his exploits.
The federal agent in the town is crocked. The town is filled with dirt, mud, roughnecks, prostitutes, and other kinds of uncouth people.

1253937,5,B00002E24S,"Pretty fair storytelling of the last days of Bill Tillghman, one of the serious lawmen of the late nineteenth- early twentieth century. Killed by a corrupt federal liquor control agent, He had led a real action filled life... the kind legends are made around. For the most part a good man ( we all live in the same cesspool), he was a formidable force for law and order in a mostly lawless land. The star of this offering is the great western actor Sam Elliot, who does his usual impeccable work as a true life hero. I recommend this movie highly as part of a series with Elliot as the main driver: ""The Quick and the Dead: (Louis Lamour story), ""Conagher"" and ""You Know My Name"".

With Sam Elliott, Arliss Howard, Carolyn McCormick, James Gammon and R. Lee Ermey.

This well-made film covers the last two years of Tilghman's life.
In order to raise funds to finish a movie, the retired lawman accepts a six-month job as marshal of Cromwell, a small Oklahoma town that in the early 1920s was much like the Old West, but with a modern twist. It was overrun with gambling and cat houses, also tommy gun carrying gangsters who were flooding Cromwell with bootleg hootch and a powder mix of cocaine and morphine.

A Prohibition agent named Wiley Lynn was addicted to this stuff. Totally corrupt, he was involved in a couple of murders. Lynn immediately became Tilghman's biggest enemy and their final encounter proved disastrous.

See the WIKIPEDIA article on Tilghman for details.

Interesting to note that the movie's postscript correctly states that the people of Cromwell ultimately rose up and cleared the town of all criminals, but it doesn't mention that these vigilantes were all Klansmen. The town was torched, all the saloons, brothels and pool halls destroyed, and it was never again open for illegal activities.

1254032,5,B00002E24S,"SOME HISTORICAL SPOILERS

Marshall Bill Tilghman was an honorable anachronism. Born in 1854, he had been a buffalo hunter, an Indian fighter, a State Senator, and a lawman of the Old West, the intimate of such legendary men as Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, Wild Bill Hickock, and Theodore Roosevelt. He had broken the Wild Bunch and the Dalton Gang, had been at the OK Corral and in Dodge City, and had lived long enough to see the West tamed. Flivvers replaced horses, electric lights replaced oil lamps, running water replaced hand pumps, and there was, as a character in the film says, ""rolled crapping paper.""

At seventy, an age when most of his compadres were dead and gone, Tilghman was asked by the Governor of Oklahoma to bring order to the town of Cromwell. In 1924, Cromwell was a dishonorable anachronism. Despite the flivvers and the electric lights, the running water and the rolled crapping paper, Cromwell was a lawless oil boomtown loaded with saloons, brothels, and gunslingers, a ramshackle town with unpaved streets full of mud, oil and horse manure, under the control of wealthy oilmen who supplied the populace with illegal White Lightning, Prohibition bathtub gin, and a loaded cocaine and morphine mixture that kept everybody over the age of 21 dangerously tweaked and working robotically, rather like methamphetamine does today.

The gravel-voiced, mustachioed, rangy, flinty-eyed Sam Elliott plays the straight-talking Tilghman to a fine turn in this TNT made-for-TV movie. Elliott's Tilghman lives on an isolated ranch near Chandler, Oklahoma with his young wife and two young sons whom he adores. His preferred transportation is the horse. His house is lit with hurricane lamps. He wears a gun belt with a six shooter. He is definitely a Nineteenth Century man. Tilghman knows this. He even wrote, produced and directed a classic Western silent, THE PASSING OF THE OKLAHOMA OUTLAWS in 1915 to counteract the false mythology that Hollywood was beginning to build around gunfighters of the Old West. ""The one good thing about outlaws,"" he says, is that they're ""dumber than stinkbugs most of them.""

Regardless of his old-fashioned ways, he has horse sense, and he begins to chip away at the crime that has devoured the town. He soon finds himself at odds with corrupt FBI Agent Wiley Lynn (Arliss Howard), bootlegger, drugrunner, wetbrain and addict, who is using his Federal badge to line his pockets and feed his habits. Although Lynn warns Tilghman to get out of town, Tilghman sees Lynn as just another punk with a ride and a gun, albeit a Model T and a ""Chicago Piano.""

The Cromwell incident reached its climax on Halloween Night 1924, when Wiley Lynn, in the company of the town's best-known Madam, Rose Lutke, began to shoot up the town. Tilghman seemingly successfully disarmed him, but was unprepared when Lynn pulled a small caliber pistol from a pocket and shot him several times at pointblank range. Wiley Lynn fled in Lutze's car. Bill Tilghman died in the early hours of November 1st.

YOU KNOW MY NAME is a true period piece, spanning that imperceptible wink of historical time when the horseriding lawmen and outlaws of the Old West coexisted with the automobile driving policemen and gangsters of the Prohibition Era. This overlap was both very brief and was limited to only a few locales, like roughnecking Cromwell, Oklahoma. And as unromantic as the 19th Century outlaw was in truth, the 20th Century gangster was even less so. The damage wrought by Organized Crime's bootlegging and illicit drug trade has far exceeded anything the bankrobbing, cattle rustling bandanna-wearing Western badmen ever accomplished.

As an historical afterword, Wiley Lynn was tried for the murder but was unbelievably acquitted when most of the witnesses against him failed to testify---a few were never seen again after the incident. In what amounts to a sorry statement on the true state of Hoover's FBI in those years, Lynn got to keep his badge and gun, though his habits only worsened. On July 17, 1932, the corrupt, wasted Lynn was killed in a shootout after he opened fire on another Agent.

As for Cromwell, it suffered a fate it deserved. Enraged that the famed Tilghman had been killed, members of the Ku Klux Klan burned Cromwell to the ground in December of 1924. Although the town was rebuilt, it never resumed its wild-and-woolly ways. Modern Cromwell is today a lost backwater with less than 275 residents and a colorful history.

1254088,3,B00002E24S,"Real life lawman, Bill Tilgham, was a giant in cow town law enforcement in the 1880's.

His stature in reality far surpasses history's sometimes myopic memory. The movie is an account of a passing era and breed. The 1920's Jazz Age was in full swing in a town still knee deep in mud streets and hitching posts. Cromwell OK had yet to be incorporated as a city, and little, if any law prevailed. Okalahoma still being somewhat new as a state. The corruption and tug of war for power as the community readies itself for impending official status as a city recalls the main plot of Deadwood, and that these true events were less than 50 years apart, is an interesting study in the country's development. Tilgham, now in the autumn of his life, has not, as most might assume, remained in the 19th century. When the film opens we find the retired lawmen in full steam at his new enterprise, film maker, producer, director of 'authentic', not Hollywood, westerns. SIDE NOTE: at the time (1924) this was happening in Okalahoma, out in Los Angeles, former contemporary of Tilgham, Wyatt Earp, was moonlighting from his newspaper journalistic prowess to be advisor to the early Tom Mix western films being made. Earp's real later life friendship with Tom Mix is depicted in book and movie as well. The cable movie, You Know My Name,was filmed with an admirable degree of authenticity and the juxtaposition of saloon girl chippies in the muddied streets of an Oil-Boom town are soundtracked by old-timey jug and string-band music, while the more ""refined"" brothel/speakeasies in town are red hot with jazz. Bootlegging (prohibition was in effect) and Whiz-Bang (a cocaine & morphine powdered mix) were the rage, and Kansas City corrupt politicos were looking to muscle in. The mid-west was still plenty wild and it looked like a job for, Sam Elliot, despite his darling wife's ardent fears. Perhaps mild by the standards of HBO's excellent series, Deadwood, You Know My Name is of a similarly historical significance in the growth of U.S. civilization.",1150934400,15,2042,4.867816091954023

  I found this movie to be wonderful if only to let the world know that Tilghman even existed..and his death was an important event so I'm glad it was portrayed.  The acting was well done and in general the casting was great.  The Wiley Lynn character at first seems over the top but if you are familiar with the man you realize that this was a very accurate portrayal.  Lynne was eventually brought down in a hail of lead but not after taking down another beloved man.

  I had some problems with the accuracy of the film though...if you've ever been to Chandler, Oklahoma you won't see huge mountains in the distance, and Tilghman never rode his horse from Chandler to Cromwell..he loved his car.  I love Sam Elliot (and he does a great job) but he's just not a 70+ year old man.

Sam Elliott does a marvelous job of making Tilghman real; the movie, though, needs some work.  I would love to see Hollywood apply some real muscle to the story of the Old West lawman, because Tilghman would be the best and only choice for a subject.  Bring in Sam Elliott to reprise the role and let him really stretch his legs in this role. This movie though will serve until that happens.  Watch this one and remember...this man was REAL and actually died with his boots on.",1118620800,51,962,4.488505747126437
1254091,5,B00002E24S,I loved the portrayal of a tough honest lawman who also showed a deep understanding of human nature.  He was also a very warm family man. The way he handled the young man who wanted to become his assistant and how he became a role model for him while he was alive is interesting.  I like certain westerns and this was a good one.  I think Sam Elliott should have been aged a little more...it was too obvious that a young man was wearing props to make him look much older. I recommend this feel-good movie for a general audience.,1006732800,21,528,4.26
1254092,5,B00002E24S,"Sam Elliot is without a doubt the best modern western actor today.  As with all his movies, he gives a stunning performance.  While filled with a few historical flaws, it shows the general theme of Bill Tilghmans life.  I admit that it would have been more interesting if they showed his earlier life and involvment with the likes of the Doolin gang. Some may say that is lacks a good plot, but the movie is a true story.",970531200,16,421,4.371794871794871
