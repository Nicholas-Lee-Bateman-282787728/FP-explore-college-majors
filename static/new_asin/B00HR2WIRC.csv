6199111,5,B00HR2WIRC,"My wife & I  finished watching the Spiderwick Chronicles a while back and we decided to order this movie on Blu-ray but it was kinds expensive.  I found this combo pack and it was cheaper, ""What a Country!"".  The movies were excellent and well made & relaxing to watch knowing that four letter words would not be used to generate a higher rating.  Although this was intended as a children's movie, we found it most enjoyable for adults.",1419897600,9,436,4.551282051282051
6199112,5,B00HR2WIRC,Love both movies great for older grandkids,1418860800,,42,5.142857142857143
6199113,5,B00HR2WIRC,"I mainly bought this for Stardust.  Stardust was an overlooked movie when it came out.  Maybe bad marketing.  Who knows.  It was a great fantasy adventure film.  Reminded me a little of The Princess Bride, but more fantasy elements.  It is a good time and not a bad movie for the family.  Spiderwick is a pretty good movie as well, but I couldn't beat the price for both movies.  Good deal.",1416960000,4,390,4.394366197183099

6199115,5,B00HR2WIRC,Got this for Spiderwick chronicles. Getting stardust upgraded to bluray from dvd was just a bonus. This at the time of purchase was the price of either movie on bluray. so you really do get 2 for the price of 1 here. Each movie is on its own disc.,1414540800,8,247,4.061224489795919

6199125,5,B00HR2WIRC,"This was a great package, because I got Stardust and my dad git Spiderwick, and we were both happy! He enjoyed his movie.

And Stardust is just a delight to watch. It's one of my favorite movies. It's humorous, romantic and action-packed. It's fairly underrated imo, so when you get a chance, check it out! It's probably not for everyone but take a chance anyway :)",1457222400,,365,4.53030303030303
