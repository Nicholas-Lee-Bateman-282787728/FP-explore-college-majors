8252652,5,B0013QRXIW,"As others have said, this is great for the first-person accounts by those involved in the effort to register African-Americans to vote in Mississippi in 1964. The accounts and general quality of the film make it very compelling. Find a reason to show this in class, or to share it with someone. It's timely given the current issues of race and violence in the U.S., and also given the tug of war over voter fraud/elections, etc.",1514678400,,428,4.644736842105263
8252653,5,B0013QRXIW,"This is the best documentary of the movement in Mississippi.  This Academy Award nominee features interviews with many volunteers and veterans who have never spoken publicly about their experiences in Mississippi; it tells a complete story with a detailed narrative of the MFDP's failed efforts at the '64 DNC; it doesn't allow the murders of Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney to overdetermine the story; and the archival footage is really really good.  And, you can now purchase a DVD copy at clarityfillms.org for $29.  Not to be missed.",1452729600,,535,5.126436781609195
8252654,5,B0013QRXIW,"For anyone interested in the civil rights movement, especially the Freedom Summers and one of the earliest African-American voter registration drives in Mississippi this is a must have.

I'm disappointed Freedom on My Mind (Story of the Mississippi Freedom Movement in the Early 1960s) isn't available here on either VHS or, preferably, DVD or Blu-ray. Hopefully it's available here soon or some other site.",1391904000,2,407,5.359375
8252655,5,B0013QRXIW,"This video details an important episode in the civil rights struggle, one that is usually overlooked in the media during Black History Month etc.  Everybody has seen ""Eyes on the Prize,"" so I wanted something different.  I teach a college course that includes a unit on the ""Freedom Movement,"" and this video ALWAYS surprises my students, even though we are an Historically Black College.

In the first place, the PBS video has a core of first-person narrators who tell their personal stories of ""Freedom Summer"" in Mississippi.

The one white student in my class last semester wrote in her journal, ""I am embarrassed to watch some of this.  I didn't know that white people acted so mean back then.""  Most of the black students also had little knowledge of the specific events detailed here, including the voter registration issues; the freedom bus rides by northern students to Mississippi; the conditions of black life in the South; the Civil Rights Act; and the Democratic National Convention of 1964, when the revolutionary alternative Mississippi Freedom Party delegation tried to get recognized and was thwarted by the supposedly liberal Johnson administration.

Well-known activists who play big roles in this video include Fanny Lou Hamer and Bob Moses.  You don't want to miss the moving, up-close portrayals of their courageous lives.

The soundtrack is outstanding.  Some of my students began singing along to the freedom songs (often shown being sung live in churches, etc), while others cried.  ""Woke up this mornin' with my mind / Set on Freedom . . .""

This is a powerful documentary that should be viewed by anyone with an academic or personal interest in our cultural / political history.

Until I found this video, I had been using a tape made by a former colleague from the original tv  broadcast.  The video is incredibly better! (of course).

Thanks so much to the ""NY Producer Guy"" who sold me this video on Amazon.  I had been searching a long time.  I hope it becomes available as a DVD.",1247529600,6,2011,4.899408284023669
