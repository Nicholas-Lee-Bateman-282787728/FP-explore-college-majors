8188409,4,B000P296BC,"This is a continuation of the storyline of one of the El-Hazard series and it is quite good. The drunk teacher makes a run for the hills,literally,before his wedding and leaves a very cranky Water Priestess,Miez, at the alter. The gang goes after him to bring him back only to find another Infarita and another female-looking instrument of mass destruction awakened by the Bugrum. This could stand alone,somewhat,as its own short story but it puts a nice cap onto the original El-Hazard series,the version that has Aliel as a raging lesbian. Well recommended.",1252713600,,559,5.021505376344086
