3736381,5,B001OTZNYY,"Another fantastic film from Denmark by some of the geniuses behind Green Butchers, Adams Apples and After the Wedding - Mads Mikkelsen never ceases to delight.",1212192000,25,159,5.153846153846154
3736382,3,B001OTZNYY,"This is a decent movie. The plot is also interesting but it falls short of being a great movie. This is one of those movies that has a lot of potential but unfortunately it doesn't materialize. About 45 minutes into the movie, it seems like that you're about to watch a great story unfolding before you but it just doesn't. The message of the movie is really good but the execution is not. Actors are amazing movie. Overall, I recommend it.",1473552000,,440,4.444444444444445

3736395,5,B001OTZNYY,"Alert:  This contains spoilers.  I chose this movie because I am a huge fan of Mads Mikkelson, but I ended up being surprised by the eery similarity this break-up had to my own divorce.  It has been twenty years...but the pain came back so strong during some of these scenes that it felt like my heart was being ripped out.  It made me think that maybe I misjudged my husband's love because he was not able to express or connect in a way that I needed him to.  During one of the scenes I was thinking, ""in real life, when things have gone this far, there is no going back"".  However, I was still hoping for that phone call at the end saying, ""I love you, I'm coming home.""

Mads is truly a genius actor and a beautiful man to watch on film.  This was a brilliant performance and a tragic and all too real story.",1452297600,,811,4.153846153846154

3736398,3,B001OTZNYY,"I give it 3 1/2 stars.  Pretty minimalist, but good story twists.  Not a big character piece--we get sketches of these people, but that's about it.  Not one of Mikkelsen's better performances, though not bad either.  Try The Hunt for a taste of some real people.",1443571200,,262,4.630434782608695

3736400,5,B001OTZNYY,"This is a stunning film.  Emotional and very sad to see the slow destruction of a marriage.  Mads Mikkelsen is intoxicating as Christoffer, he is a rare actor who can convey his emotion with a simple gesture or with that penatrating stare.  If your a fan?  Definitely put this beautiful film on your list.",1441584000,4,305,4.592592592592593

3736409,5,B001OTZNYY,"A very human look at marriage and the difference between men and women.  These two are dynamite together.  You know in your heart they will be fine once they have time to heal their wounded egos.  Loved the movie, it was made for grown-ups.",1431302400,,240,4.409090909090909
3736410,4,B001OTZNYY,"The director may not be up to Ingmar Bergman, but my wife and I both enjoyed watching this film and continued talking it about it the day after we watched.  There is only one weak plot point, near the end, when the wife makes an announcement she should have made near the start.",1431129600,,278,4.245283018867925
3736411,5,B001OTZNYY,"Here's Mads in all his glory. Gorgeous, deep, layered. He and Stine portray a married couple on the fringes of divorce, stuck with each other on a trip to Prague to recover his father's body. The cinematography is hypnotic, as this story unfolds in a city so complex and dramatic, just as the main characters relationship.",1430265600,,322,4.767857142857143
3736412,5,B001OTZNYY,WHY OH WHY????? Is this great movie pillarboxed? I HATE movies that look like a postage stamp on a large screen. Was the mastering engineer drunk when this movie was mastered? There is so much space on the screen for another movie running at the same time. It is the same on a 56 inch screen. They nearly always do this to the best movies.,1429401600,4,339,4.230769230769231

3736415,5,B001OTZNYY,"Ahhh the Danes. Yet another extraordinary performance by Mads Mikkelsen, who has to be among the greatest film actors ever. This is a rewarding, human film about a Danish couple who go to Prague to retrieve the body of the husband's father, who lived in a self-imposed exile in Prague. Mysteries of the human heart are again explored by the Danes, in a cinematically gorgeous and understated manner. I've watched this film maybe 15 times, and it never gets old. You will learn something about being human from this film.",1418601600,2,520,4.788888888888889
3736426,5,B001OTZNYY,"Best movie about a break up I have ever seen. Painfully honest. Fantastic writing. Fantastic acting. Just stellar all around.

And then there's Mads. God, I could just lick the screen whenever he appears. And he is wonderful in this.",1418083200,,233,4.825

3736428,3,B001OTZNYY,"Amazon created this DVD from its streaming capacity. It contains only the movie, not the extras that the original DVD would have, and that disappointed me (you can't pick scenes to go back to, for example).",1416787200,,206,4.75
3736429,5,B001OTZNYY,Even better on second viewing!  If you are reading the subtitles you may miss the spot on body language and abundance of silent communication.  An intelligent and accurate study of a broken relationship and the impossibility of connecting to a partner who's ability to express or experience his emotions is seriously impaired.  Beautiful setting & cinematography.  Not for the short attention span of the average American viewer. . .,1411776000,,433,5.231884057971015

There isn't much dialogue in the beginning, but it manages to keep your interest.  It's about a couple having marital troubles and one of them is having an affair.",1409097600,,259,4.586956521739131

3736437,5,B001OTZNYY,Clever story of a trip by a son to pick up his deceased estranged father revealing a troubled marriage with dramatic dialogue between the son and his wife.  Love Mars Mikkelsen in this role and the entire supporting cast.  Highly recommended as is almost any other film with Mars as the lead.,1403049600,,292,4.596153846153846
3736438,5,B001OTZNYY,You can't go wrong with Mads' movies. He's so talented and can play any character. Have not seen one of his movies that we didn't like. The only complaint that we have is having to wait for his movies to be released in the US!,1402617600,,226,4.044444444444444
3736439,4,B001OTZNYY,"If you are looking for a happy ending, this is not the movie for you.
Mads' character is unable to express love especially for his wife, who, by the way, he loves very much. When his father dies in Prague, he goes there with his wife to take care of the estate. His wife goes with him to break up because she has met someone else.
It is not very clear whether she loves this man and indications are that she does not love the new man as much as she loves her husband. She is pregnant and her husband is not the father. Mads' character and his wife have a son and because of he is not capable of showing love, the boy is also unhappy. If his wife and boy are not happy he must agree with the breakup for their sake.
We find that his condition is due to his relationship with his father.
I shed a few tears watching this movie because aside from some really great writting the acting is superb. I am a great fan of Mads Mikkelsen",1401753600,,927,4.043478260869565
3736440,4,B001OTZNYY,"I have recently (thanks to Amazon Prime) fallen in LOVE with Danish movies. They are AMAZING. The Danish film makers seem to have an ability to depict human relationships and emotions in a way that is real, raw, intense, and complex yet beautiful. I can't get enough of these films. The acting is superb, music is great, writing is amazing, has some strange comical and humorous moments, cinematography is interesting. I love the lead male character who has been in about three other Danish films that I have watched. I can not recommend this movie enough. The other Danish film that I would recommend is ""After the Wedding"".",1399766400,4,625,4.796296296296297

3736442,5,B001OTZNYY,"The dissolution of 14 years of marriage is the main theme as the protagonists endeavor to make funeral arrangements for a family member.  Very little censorship especially in language and, as is true of many European films, a good study of human behavior under difficult circumstances.  The camera closeups of the facial expressions of the unfortunate spouses add another level of language of just how strained and irreparable the relationship is.  Great Film.

3736444,3,B001OTZNYY,"Despite having lived in Prague, enjoying seeing the scenery again after all these years, and being a huge Mads Mikkelsen fan, I did not love this movie.  It was well acted but a bit bland, obviously sad, and I simply couldn't get drawn into this drama.  Fitting movie to have rented for $2 or so on this rainy Sunday.",1396137600,,317,4.3559322033898304

3736449,5,B001OTZNYY,"I bought the DVD with english subtiles since there are none in French! It is a wonderful film where Mads MIkkelsen is just brillant!
Now, as a great fan of this  actor, I also wish there were Susanne Bier's DVD with French subtiles(Open Hearts, After the wedding... )
Parisians are movie-goers so it could be a good idea....",1391212800,,324,4.586206896551724

3736451,4,B001OTZNYY,Mads and the rest of the cast do a very good job of creating this movie.  It pushes you to look at what you might do if you were given the task of coming to terms with a difficult past within your family and especially with an estranged parent.  This is very typical of many modern Scandinavian movies.,1390089600,,302,4.189655172413793
3736452,5,B001OTZNYY,"For me this is not a film about the possible dissolution of a marriage, but rather the reclamation of a man's life and the possibilities of finding an authentic life with his wife and son.  Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant as a 40ish man, highly successful  in the outer world and living a banal and habituated life, awakening to the truth of his relationships as he confronts the ghosts of his dead father.  Not a joy ride for American audiences seeking more Michael Bay or Sylvester Stallone, but a richly rewarding film for those seeking a mature story about a crucial time of life that all of us must face or ignore at our peril.",1389139200,,628,4.491228070175438

3736456,2,B001OTZNYY,"I was excited to see this film as I usually like Mads Mikkelsen but was very disappointed. This film never really gets off the ground; I kept waiting for something to happen. It seems disjointed, lacks intensity and there is little character development.  If you like Mads Mikklelsen or great films in general I would highly recommend getting After the Wedding or The Hunt instead.",1383350400,,381,4.861538461538461
3736457,5,B001OTZNYY,anything Mads does is intense & emotional- Danish films are always very interesting and have the power to draw the viewer into the story line quickly,1381190400,4,149,4.769230769230769
3736458,5,B001OTZNYY,"One would think that traveling to Prague to collect the body of his father and take it home to Denmark for burial would be a simple task, especially since there was no real love there. Wrong. With his wife Maja(Stine Stengade) accompaning him, Cristofer(Mads Mikkelsen), goes about the task in his own unemotional way, until the truth tears him apart. Maja, bored with her husband, explodes. Besides ugly words, there is one particular scene of venting that most would consider vulgar. But it was necessary, as you'll see if you watch this brilliant take on the truth and how these two respond. Brilliantly acted and directed.",1377907200,,626,4.915094339622642
3736459,3,B001OTZNYY,"Having lived in Prague for 10 years, I was automatically drawn to a film made there.  I enjoyed it.  The theme is real life about how two people can become too familiar with each other leading to a boring marriage.  The underlying story of the man's father added an interesting twist.  This film does a good job of capturing the personalities of the Czech people too.",1376697600,4,367,4.515151515151516

3736462,5,B001OTZNYY,"This is a good movie featuring Mads Mikkelsen and Stine Stengade.  It tells the tale of a fatherless son now a grown man who goes with his wife to Prague to retrieve his father's body and take care of his property.  While there Christoffer confronts his wife Maja about her seeing another man.  He tries to hold onto his marriage so they might fix it but he learns his father wasn't the man he pictured.  Mikkelsen & Stengade do a fantastic job in this movie as a couple struggling to not hurt each other but both feel hurt by the other.  It is worth a watch, you won't be disappointed.

This movie is spoke in Danish & Czech with English subtitles.",1374624000,,649,4.322314049586777
3736463,3,B001OTZNYY,"I rented this movie on the strength of Mads Mikkelsen's acting.  I wanted to like it more but felt there was something missing.  Finding out that your wife is cheating on you while you buried your long lost father was weird!  Then to find out he was a homosexual running a club with his lawyer lover overseeing burying the body made no sense to me.  As I said, I wanted to like it more but had a hard time.  I do love Mr. Mikkelsen's acting style and will watch whatever movie he is in!!!  The actress playing his wife was a bit stiff and removed to understand why he would want to stay with her??

3736469,5,B001OTZNYY,I loved this film...interesting storyline and the emotions felt very REAL...beautifully acted and made me want to visit Prague...and Denmark!,1367625600,,141,6.1
3736470,4,B001OTZNYY,"The plot is promising. However, the failing marriage is not explored in any depth. The plot offers the possibility of throwing light on the marriage of these two people, but it doesn't do that. Why did the wife start the affair? Just because her husband ""wasn't there"" emotionally? What does that mean? Where did the estrangement come from? What kind of estrangement was it? There are so many kinds. As Tolstoy said, and I paraphrase, ""All happy marriages are alike; I am interested in the unhappy marriages, which are all different."" And did he explore them in depth! Even his short story ""The Death of Ivan Ilych,"" which deals mainly with the thoughts of a dying man, exposes all the mistakes and the selfishness of his marriage. Yes, both our books and our movies are becoming shallow.
In Prague, does the husband really love his wife?  Does she love him? Who knows? Did she ever love him? At the beginning of the movie, he asks her when she was last happy with him. A very good question, but she can't answer, and even her inability to answer is not explained.  There is little reality to this movie. Mads indeed is a good actor. His wife is also a good actor, but her character never explains why she is so attached to a man so many years younger than she.
SECOND VIEWING OF THE MOVIE:
Well, I was much too harsh and hasty in my judgment. Seeing it a second time, I noticed its subtle beauty and depth. Prague is a poem, a chamber movie (as in chamber music). It's all there--the break-up and the pain--not only in direct statements and actions, but in hints and in silences, in looks and subtle facial expressions. This is a poetic and layered expression of devastation. The sudden explosion of anger between the two in public puts into sharp relief the laced and intricate design of the whole movie. Also interesting is the even-handed treatment of the husband and the wife. Both have failed somehow in their marriage, but they hadn't noticed the failure until it explodes in their faces. Whose fault is it--the wife's or the husband's? You can't say because both had been oblivious to the abyss opening between them and therefore unable to build a bridge of understanding and introspection over it. I still would like to know why the wife never tried to explain her misery to her husband, instead of taking on a lover, but that remains my only dissatisfaction with this poetic movie.",1365638400,5,2391,4.623529411764705

3736475,4,B001OTZNYY,"As most reviews have already stated, Mads Mikkelson is brilliant per usual. He is an actor who makes you forget he is acting, not matter the challenge of the role. Stine Stengade is up to the task as well.

Some here have said the story is too cliche or that it has been told so many times. So were Shakespeare's stories, almost all of them taken from prior source material. There are scant few movies you'll see that tell a new story. What makes a story is the way it is told (the film and director), the words written to tell it and the actors who bring it to life. And it's in those elements that this movie achieves its mastery.",1356825600,,632,4.223140495867769

3736477,4,B001OTZNYY,"Mads Mikkelsen is great as always. The story has been told a thousand times. A married couple is forced by fate into unfamiliar and deeply painful circumstances that demand emotional honesty from them for the first time in years. She's in love with a younger man, he has long-known it but never said so until now. Slowly they both come to understand that the only glue between them is a child and a lot of sadness. It's a very good but not a great film.",1352937600,,453,4.341176470588235
3736478,4,B001OTZNYY,"If Mads Mikkelsen has an equivalent in the Hollywood pecking order as far as star power or acting stature it would be Viggo Mortensen because neither give two hoots or a holler about any of that. Mads is so indoctrinated in Eastern Europe culture maybe he will never make a journey across the big waters to sell his soul for a lead in some commercial garbage and I don't see it ever happening. After his stoic role in Valhalla Rising which was made after Prague he has more natural commanding presence of person than any actor now working in recent memory.

This film is maddening in a way that totally rejects conformity and expectation. Stine Stengade as his becoming estranged wife is also as keen in her role as they arrive to depose of his dead father's remains in Europe's most historic and beautiful of cities. We only see glimpses of this Prague as their relationship crumbles in dramatic close ups and coming to truth of whom each other really is. There are no winners and the film as a whole is bleak and sad, but as a son discovers a father he never knew, Mads character unravels a bit more beyond than he has ever known himself. Unnamed rivers and barriers are crossed - all emotional and phycological. This is a great film. If being taken down to the saddest point in life is your cup of tea, I say brew on and pour away. This is strong stuff and rules the waters that flow down the Vltava. Go drown yourself in some deep, dark miserable and be happy I reffered you to this terrific cinematic poem.",1329264000,42,1511,4.4352517985611515
3736479,4,B001OTZNYY,"Prague is a bittersweet and moving film about one man's discovery of his late fathers secret life, and the collapse of his own marriage. As it's a Danish film - it rather goes without saying - that it's elegant, thoughtful and subtle. This film benefits from multiple viewings, it just seems to get better and better each time you watch it.",1329091200,10,340,4.590163934426229
3736480,5,B001OTZNYY,"Mads Mikkelson's ability to portray believable, compelling characters with real human flaws and complexity is astounding, and this film provides a great example of such a performance.",1312934400,5,183,5.814814814814815
3736481,5,B001OTZNYY,"Prague is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful old cities in Europe: it is also seen as clinging to many of the old traditions of the rigid life of the past - immutable, on guard, cold.  It is therefore a very fitting setting for this brilliant film PRAGUE, a story written (with Kim Fupz Akeson) and directed by Ole Christian Madsen that deals with contemporary relationships, family, and the bifurcation between surface appearance and reality.

Christoffer (Mads Mikkelson) and his wife Maja (Stine Stengade) have traveled from Denmark without their young son to tend to the final paperwork following the death of Christoffer's father, a father he has not seen or communicated with for 25 years when the father left wife and son for Prague.  Christoffer shows no emotion about this mission and even when the doctor (Josef Vajnar) demands Christoffer view the body for identification, there is no sense of sadness.  His father's lawyer (Borivoj Navrtil) make all the arrangements for the shipment of the body back to Denmark and informs Christoffer that the financial balance sheet at the time of death leaves Christoffer with only the house in which his father lived, a place Christoffer plans to sell immediately to end this Prague obligation.  But during all the 'business' of dealing with his father's death, Christoffer feels a distance from Maja and confronts her with his knowledge that she is having an affair.  The veneer of their marriage cracks open and the couple must face the current status of their relationship, a widening crevice that is in many ways held together only by the frequent video calls with their son in Denmark. Theirs  is a history of love examined.

Christoffer's closure with his father includes the discovery that his father had a beautiful singer/housekeeper Alena (Jana Plodkov) who lived with the father with her daughter. When they meet they have no common language but Christoffer learns of his father's apparent abiding love for Christoffer.  Another surprise hits Christoffer when he discovers the relationship between his father and the lawyer, a relationship that explains why the father left Denmark for Prague and a new life.  With all the new information about the father he never knew Christoffer faces decisions about his own marriage and his role as a father to his own son and the last wishes of his father before he died. Though eager to return to Denmark there are 'procedural problems' that prolong the stay in Prague

PRAGUE  is a story about love in all its permutations - disappointments, rewards, and longings both filled and unfulfilled.  The manner in which each of the characters plays out the consequences of love against the cold background of the rigid atmosphere of the city of Prague is like watching organisms under a microscope.  Enhanced by a powerful musical score by Jonas Struch and moody cinematography by Jrgen Johansson  it is a powerful film, beautifully acted, and one with much food for thought even after the film is over.

3736482,4,B001OTZNYY,"Having seen quite a few Danish films, I have to say that this one would probably be considered typical, both in a good and bad way.

It's typical in a good way because of the gritty, believable plot, beautiful cinematography, the quality of the acting, the pace of the film and well done musical score. It's good because there is some predictability, but also (towards the end, of course) very unpredictable twisting of the plot in a direction one wouldn't suspect at the outset. Still, that's what typically makes for a good Danish film.

What makes it typical in a bad way is probably the slow parts of the film, the protracted scenes which might have been shortened and, in this case, almost complete lack of any intensity. I realize it's not an action flick, but there's literally only one scene in the film where people are truly raising their voices and getting crazy. It is, however, extremely well done in that instance, so to some degree that makes up for it being the only such scene in the film.

All said, I still recommend this movie. Again, it's typical for both good and bad reasons, but it remains a typical example of quality Danish cinema. Definitely something you should have in your collection, especially if you're a Mads Mikkelsen fan.",1260057600,4,1257,4.678733031674208

Extremely well done, it leaves one almost breathless with the gut-level emotions portrayed by these people.

 I usually love Danish film and give rave reviews such as the reviews I gave Italian for Beginners, Bodres, and Flame and Citrine because usually the emotion is dead on in all Danish film but this one fell flat.

I think the actress lacked likeability and Mads Mikkelson is usually awesome but he just wasn't his best in this one; perhaps he was poorly directed.  I should have rented In a Better World, I was deciding between the two.",1475020800,,589,4.4766355140186915
