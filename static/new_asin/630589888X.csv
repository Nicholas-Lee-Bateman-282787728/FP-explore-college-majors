Geils Band "" Centerfold"" a masterpiece! If you like Santana's music his song "" Winning"" is included here as a video clip, get this DVD highly recommended.",1425340800,,445,4.792207792207792
7897624,3,630589888X,this is what you get the music videos shown are like watching vhs tapes becase thats where they came from but the videos are hard to come by yes some are cut off about 5 or 8 seconds from the endings but other than that its ok just think its 80s technogy,1369008000,,254,3.9038461538461537
7897625,1,630589888X,"The videos look like someone dubbed a video, then digitized the result.  There's actually a video hiccup at least one of the videos.  These were apparently originally broadcast on something called ""That Teen Show"".  Sound and video quality are poor, and the beginnings and ends of many songs are cut off.
On the other hand, there are several songs here that are hard or impossible to find on video anywhere else.",1016409600,,412,4.774647887323944
7897626,1,630589888X,"Like any big 80's music fan, I was thrilled when I saw this DVD. Of course, I bought it right away, drove home, and sat down to watch.  I quickly realized 30 seconds into the DVD that I made a big mistake.  I could record these videos on my VCR with better quality and transition--almost anyone could.  Please save your money and treat yourself to a couple pizzas--they will be much more satisfying and last a lot longer than this DVD.",1004227200,,435,4.345679012345679
7897627,1,630589888X,"This DVD (and it's first volume) are absolutely unacceptable as anything other than complete trash. What a disappointment! For starters, the video and sound quality are horrible! It honestly looks worse than a VHS video. (No joke here.) There are noticeable glitches, it looks and sounds as if someone was adjusting the tracking on a VCR as this was being transferred to DVD! Most of the videos have obvious edits and skips in them, and most (95%) of the songs have the beginnings cut-off (mid-lyric) and the ends just chopped. I don't believe one video is complete. Some videos are so washed-out it's ridiculous. There are NO extras at all, nor are there any credits or record company recognitions listed. Please don't waste your time on this thing. Unbelievable!",989193600,,764,4.930232558139535
7897628,1,630589888X,"I was very excited when I found this disc.  Classic 80's videos from my  formative years watching MTV.  I knew these videos and couldn't wait to see  them in high quality DVD fashion with Dolby Digital sound - as  advertised.
Well, I was quickly driven to ""Disappointment City.""  This disc  was clearly mastered from old, worn out, home-VCR quality tapes.  The  images are fuzzy throughout ... you can even see tape-skip and white fuzzy lines.  If you have surround sound, most of the music comes from  the center speaking with a little in the front right and left channels.  Basically, a mono effect.
To make matters worse - I didn't believe it  could get worse - the videos just cut off abruptly toward the end each  song.  Cutting off the music and video.
You'll be disappointed in this  DVD.  It's an embarrassing effort.  If you love 80's videos, you'll be even  more disappointed because it will far under delivery on your expectations.",965001600,,942,4.703703703703703
