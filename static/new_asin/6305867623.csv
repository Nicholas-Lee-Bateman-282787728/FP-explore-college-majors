1084988,2,6305867623,"The often-reliable Leonard Maltin says this is a ""delightful romance"" and that Sanders is ""superb."" Maltin must have confused this movie with something else. Sanders is snide and droll and superb, as usual, - you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery, ""Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three,"" -but dull, wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately. The storyline itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels, is entertaining enough, but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as *Marie Antoinette*, and certainly the deplorable *Forever Amber* (which screams for a classy remake). Though, in his defense, Sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character, it is all for naught. I am an unabashed Douglas Sirk fan, but this is 1946, and it is one of Sirk's earliest American efforts, lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid, breast-heaving potboilers. Sirk is just getting his feet wet here, and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with *Magnificent Obsession*, and hit his stride, bombarding us with such estrogen-fests as *All That Heaven Allows*, *Written on the Wind*, and *Imitation of Life*. But *Scandal In Paris* is hardly his best work - a relatively low-budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming.",1106438400,7,1536,5.075098814229249
1084989,4,6305867623,"This little known and seemingly underappreciated movie is actually a sophisticated piece of movie art.  I had expected a journeyman effort from Douglas Sirk, but found instead a master working at the peak of his powers.  The subject matter seems light on the surface, but probes questions of identity and personal responsibility.  The slipperiness of the character of George Sanders' Vidoq is a foil to others' distorted views of themselves.  Many of Sirk's tropes are present, including an abundance of mirrors, particularly in the harrowing climactic scene, and some fantastic use of shadow.  The tavern dance scene by Carole Landis is worth the price of admission.  To top it all off, the dialogue is worthy of Billy Wilder, and the photography is superb.  George Sanders' performance is second only to Addison DeWitt, and Carole Landis is luminous.",1081296000,16,852,5.175182481751825
7896858,5,6305867623,"This is a review of the Cohen Film Collection blu-ray edition of A Scandal in Paris, sold on Amazon as TWO FILMS BY DOUGLAS SIRK DOUBLE FEATURE. I believe the Amazon Video edition is similar in viewing quality.

A Scandal in Paris, the third Hollywood film to credit Douglas Sirk as director, describes a fictionalized version of historical figure Eugne Franois Vidocq's ascent from cad and criminal to solid citizen and pioneering criminologist. Vidocq is played by George Sanders, still young enough to look good on a white horse. Sanders has suave down pat. And he delivers the script's best lines, which might have been written by Oscar Wilde, with just the right touch. Akim Tamiroff plays Emile, Vidocq's coarse, unimaginative, and irredeemably materialistic partner/sidekick, with the broad and appealing ethnic touches for which the actor was once well known. (Tamiroff was later the inspiration for cartoon character Boris Badenov.) If Vidocq is something this side of irredeemable, the film suggests it is because he sees a bridge between his lower-class state and aristocracy in the person of Casanova. Indeed, throughout most of the film Vidocq tries to out-Casanova Casanova, and that side of him meets its match in ""bad girl"" (lower-class) Loretta, expertly played by the lovely Carole Landis as a cross between Jean Harlow and Judy Holiday. The lady who really sets Vidocq's heart a-flutter, however, is upper-class Therse, whose lust, almost totally internalized as Idealized Feelings, is practically invisible on the surface. Therse is played by Swedish actress Signe Hasso. Cohen supplies a solid commentary for Scandal by Wade Major, who turns out to be a huge fan of Signe Hasso.

A Scandal in Paris calls to mind the refined craft, rich humor, and sly sophistication of such Ernst Lubitsch films as Trouble in Paradise and Bluebeard's Eighth Wife. Sirk, though, is here less concerned than Lubitsch with naturalism in his staging. Sirk lets images call attention to themselves in ways that are bold, even fantastic. For example, shadow silhouettes both frame and help define the role of Loretta in the film; not coincidentally Loretta is Vidocq's favorite so long as he is primarily seeking and responding to life's surfaces. Elsewhere the film lets a religious painting on a church wall, through random events and chance, define Vidocq's relationship with both Emile and Therse. And as the relationship with Emile approaches its culmination, Vidocq finds himself purified and ennobled through baptism in waters of childhood innocence. Scores of such carefully interrelated pictoral and narrative details give this movie a surprisingly complex texture. Sirk later thought of this as his most artistic film.

The visual elements used for production of the Scandal blu-ray are sharp and clear, likely to please all but the pickiest collectors. There is one reel in the middle of the film where the soundtrack becomes noisy; elsewhere the sound is clear and clean. Cohen Film Collection promotes this as a classic of American cinema, and I would not disagree. Five stars.",1485734400,,3089,5.211267605633803

7896863,2,6305867623,"Disappointed in this movie. Not the actual DVD. IT was fine as stated. VGC. But the actual movie was a bit boring and the quality of the movie itself was poor. A lot of flickers and spots in white, and sound quality was not too good. The story needed more ""umph!""...not a good plot/storyline. The humor was OK. ..though a bit weak by today's standards. Though George Sanders was at his very best. He was young and very handsome in this movie. Nice settings...I mostly enjoyed the sets and places where it was filmed. I think this is from the 1940's.",1413072000,,549,4.445544554455446
7896864,4,6305867623,"So goes the witty script for Douglas Sirk's lighthearted period caper/biopic 'A Scandal in Paris' (Arnold Productions/United Artists, 1946), based on the writings of its protagonist, legendary thief-cum-detective Eugene Francois Vidocq-- a role (as others have pointed out) urbane-scoundrel-incarnate George Sanders was born to play.  It's no masterpiece, but a strong cast, high-caliber performances and an intelligent, engaging story more than compensate for any technical and artistic shortcomings.  Kino's 2003 DVD offers a decent print which, while the picture is sharp with good contrast, is marred by age-related artifacts aplenty and a soundtrack that gets a little wobbly at times, including sporadic spits and hisses.  No extras.  Film rates 4-minus stars, presentation (taking into consideration the rarity of the title) 3-plus.",1395964800,4,839,5.909090909090909

7896867,5,6305867623,"This movie starts out a little slow but then Carole Landis enters as the sultry singer Loretta and things get very interesting. She falls in love with the dashing George Sanders who is more interested in stealing her ruby garter. The highlight of the film is definitely Carole singing ""Flame Song"". The 1800s costumes designed by Norma Koch are fantastic! There's also a very funny performance by Gene Lockhart as Carole's jealous husband. If you are already a Carole Landis fan you'll love A Scandal In Paris, if not you will be a fan after watching this.",1367107200,,556,4.742268041237113
