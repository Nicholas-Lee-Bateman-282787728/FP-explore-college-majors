1224841,5,B00000INCJ,"This series is beautifully done.  I believe that Ian Carmichael captures perfectly the verve and humanity of Lord Peter Wimsey in Dorothy Sayer's books.  The acting is excellent and the settings are nicely done.  I find  the story a good mystery, but to me the best part of this series is the  characterizations, from Wimsey, Bunter, Lady Mary and Detective Parker to  the briefly-seen characters, such as the Colonel and some colorful  Yorkshire natives.  Wimsey and Bunter, as played by Ian Carmichael and Glyn  Houston, epitomize what is good in the world, and they also have a great  sense of humor.",949968000,6,603,4.881188118811881
1224842,5,B00000INCJ,"I saw this and other Lord Peter Whimsey episodes when they first appeared on ""Masterpiece Theatre"" back in the '70s (the golden years).  Some time ago, BBC produced another version of the Whimsey stories which  were good but not nearly as good as the earlier ones with Ian Charmichael.  This and the other Charmichael renditions of the Lord Peter Whimsey mystery  stories are on a par with the likes of ""Upstairs Downstairs"" and  ""I Claudius"".  And they are better than the best of what has been  seen on PBS's ""Mystery"" ( which is saying a lot -- I love  ""Mystery"").  So if you are a ""Masterpiece Theatre""  lover but your viewing experience does not extend back to this era, I can  assure you that these tapes will be a great treat.",939254400,20,733,4.519083969465649
1224843,5,B00000INCJ,"There are several ways for a writer to startle the reader at the end of a mystery. The most overused is ""the least likely suspect"" solution, a variant being found in an early Ellery Queen novel when a  character already proven to be innocent turned out to be the guilty party.  Agatha Christie broke all the rules when she made the first-person narrator  the killer and again when she made all the suspects the collaborating  killers and most outrageously of all when she made the Master Detective the  killer. (Contact me if you want the titles of these books.)  With  Dorothy Sayers we have far better written novels--though not necessarily  better mysteries than those solved by Poirot and Marple--with characters  far more human and therefore interesting. So when the BBC decided back in  1972 to film several of her Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries, mostly at the  urging of comedian Ian Carmichael, that actor was not even on the short  list of candidates for the part  since he was too closely associated with  Bertie Wooster, whom he had shortly before that played on British telly.  But he got the part and the rest is history.  Five of the Wimsey  mysteries were filmed and shown a year later on ""Masterpiece  Theatre"": <Clouds of Witness,> <The Unpleasantness at the  Bellona Club,> <Five Red Herrings,> <Murder Must Advertise,>  and <The Nine Tailors>.  They were a smash with audiences on both  sides of the Atlantic and showed up later with a new series title,  ""Murder Most British,"" which included only three of them. The  Lord Peter Wimsey website was filled with inquiries from fans panting to  get copies of any or all of the fabulous five, but the BBC retained a stony  silence.  The good news is, as you might have guessed by now, that Acorn  Media is releasing four of them and <Clouds of Witness> is now  available as a boxed set of five tapes and it is a stunner. My only quibble  is that more than one of the 45 minute episodes could easily have been  accommodated on a tape; but I am so delighted to have it at all that any  such monetary objections must fall by the wayside.  Without revealing the  ending, let me say it is of a type not already mentioned in my opening!  Lord Peter's brother Gerald is accused of murdering a man he had just  argued with that evening and steadfastly refuses to say where he was at the  time of the killing, although he was found bending over the body and his  own gun was the means of death. So with too many clues to help him and a  certain major character making up lies all the way, Lord Peter is chased by  a vicious dog, nearly drowns in a bog, barely makes a stormy trans-Atlantic  flight to save his brother, and unlike the more cerebral Poirot, bumbles  now and then in his conclusions in a very human way.  In fact, all the  characters are quite human. When the well-read Wimsey tosses a reference to  ""Manon Lescaut"" to his Scotland Yard companion and  brother-in-law-to-be (played beautifully by Mark Eden), the impatient  detective retorts, ""I never read Manon Lescaut,"" drawing an  apology from the somewhat abashed Lord. Even the Duchess avoids stereotype  with her upperclass-cool remarks concerning the proceedings, suggesting in  a deep contralto a ""nice cup of tea"" at a crisis during her son's  trial.  As with the BBC Poirot series, the 1920s dcor is impeccable and  adds greatly to the amusement. Indeed it is for the acting and the art  design that I will return many times to view this and the other tapes. I  can only hope that <The Nine Tailors> will find its way into the  series once the other four are out for sale. Acorn Media, who has already  given us ""Mapp and Lucia,"" ""Disraeli,"" and the Canadian  Gilbert and Sullivans already reviewed on these pages, is to be thanked for  making this new series available to seekers of the finer style of mystery  recreation.",935625600,19,3850,4.632986627043091
1224844,5,B00000INCJ,"Clouds of Witness is filmed like a stage production of a mystery play. I first saw the series as a child when it was broadcast by PBS on Masterpiece Theater almost 30 years ago. Perhaps there is too much nostalgic fondness  in my review, but I found it to be one of the more entertaining and twisty  television mysteries, done with impeccable style and good taste. Ian  Carmichael is quite dashing and debonair as Lord Peter, and the rest of the  cast is equally appealing. It is truly first class entertainment, and it  leaves me wondering why more shows can't be like this.",935539200,5,575,4.543689320388349
1224922,5,B00000INCJ,"British mysteries are radically different from those made in America. One of the main differences is the quaintness of the characters; they are not as handsome as in American films, but are more real and are covered with a patina of humor. This film is filled with such people, and it is loaded with red herrings.

 Peter Wimsey's family is quite quaint. His sister is engaged to one man, has arranged to run off with another, and flirts with a third. This second man is a philanderer and a gambler. Peter's mother seems intelligent, considerate, but not altogether present in this world. His brother is accused of the murder of the man his sister was going to run off with. His brother insists that he has an alibi for the time of the murder, but refuses to reveal it to his lawyer or to Peter. He is married to a woman who seems like a red herring gone sour.

 There are other characters. Peter's butler, who has saved his life several times, and does it again in this film, is most likely the most practical person in the film. Beyond doubt, despite Peter being the Dorothy Sayers' Sherlock Holmes, Peter could not function or even survive without him. Then there is Peter's friend, a cop, who seems blind to the charms of Peter's sister. Peter comes in contact with an apparently insane, or near insane, somewhat aged farmer with a young beautiful wife who is frightened of her husband. The farmer is extremely jealous. He has a dog, a large Sherlock Holmes type dog, to chase off anyone who comes to his farm. Then there is the unusual court of peers who try Peter's brother for the murder.

The dead man bought a precious jewel for a woman. Who was this woman? Was it Peter's sister? Is this one of the many red herrings? Who killed this man? How can Peter save his brother? Why doesn't he want to reveal his alibi?",1294963200,,1821,4.47289156626506
1224923,5,B00000INCJ,"Never has there been a more pig-headed jack-ass than Lord Peter Wimsey's, brother Gerald. Never was there a more strait-laced wife than Gerald's. Luckily, never had a Lord of the Realm, a more loyal, steadfast and insightful brother, than Gerald had in Lord Peter. Thus when Gerald was accused of murder, when all the evidence pointed against him, when he refused to reveal vital facts as to his whereabouts, who was there to step into the breach, Lord Peter.
Once again, Ian Carmichael gives us a rounded portrait of the brilliant sleuth, at heart and in society, an aristocrat, but one unable to be bound by the strictures on behavior then demanded by other peers of the realm. The death this year (2010) of Carmichael made me aware of the fact than when he did the Wimsey series for BBC, he was all of 53 years old, not the more youthful and empty headed Bertie Wooster, he had done earlier. He carries his age gracefully, making of Lord Peter a gentleman of indeterminate years, youthful in demeanor if not in chronological age. The remainder of the cast, as is customary for the BBC in this period, was quite up to scratch, with Lord Peters mother, sister, man-servant Bunter, and his policeman friend, all giving admirable support.
If the old fashioned mystery in vibrant color and decor, is your cup of tea, this will be a most satisfactory brew.",1270944000,,1353,4.689075630252101
1224924,4,B00000INCJ,"This was the first ""Lord Peter Wimsey"" story that I encountered and I enjoyed it a lot. Ian Carmichael is appealing as Wimsey and the supporting cast is also good. One thing I found funny is how often the characters are pouring themselves a drink -- morning, noon, night -- it doesn't matter. I look forward to watching more or the programs in the series.",1121904000,,355,4.476923076923077
1224925,5,B00000INCJ,"I am so glad to see this on DVD, and those who have it on VHS will be surprised--it looks fantastic!  You'd never know this was done in 1972.
The picture is crisp and clear, even when switching from video to film (a common practice in those days--film outdoors, and videotape indoors).  The sound level is a bit low, but it is not a problem--turning up the volume does not distort the sound in any way.
Lord Peter Wimsey (Ian Carmichael) must find the evidence to clear his older brother, Gerald, the Duke of Denver (David Langton) from the charge of murder.  The victim is the fianc of Gerald and Peter's sister, Lady Mary Wimsey (Rachel Herbert).
There is much conflicting testimony amongst the witnesses, and Lord Peter, ably assisted by his faithful manservant Bunter (Glyn Houston) and Inspector Parker (Mark Eden), does his best to save his brother.
The script is well written, and well paced. We get to see a trial in the House of Lords, something most viewers have perhaps heard of, but never have witnessed.  We see the Wimsey family (Lord Peter, the Dowager Duchess, Lady Mary, and the Duke of Denver), and their friends (the Arbuthnots and others), in an excellent adaptation of what life was life in the upper-crust families after World War I.
The cast is first rate, as is the story and the quality of the DVD.  There are extras (an interview with Ian Carmichael from September of 2000, information on Dorothy L.Sayers, a trivia quiz, and filmographies of the principal players) that make a nice addition to this slipcovered two-DVD set. Acorn Media has done a splendid job--highly recommended!",1011830400,28,1607,4.766187050359712
1224926,5,B00000INCJ,"Lord Peter Wimsey's brother Gerald, the Duke of Denver, has got himself into ""a spot of bother.""  He is accused of killing Lady Mary Wimsey's fiance, a card cheat named Cathcart.  All the evidence points to the Duke, but Lord Peter knows his brother is innocent and begins the slow process of gathering evidence to find the truth.  In this complicated case Lord Peter must fly to America to interview a beautiful woman once involved with Cathcart.  Lord Peter returns just in the nick of time to give evidence at the trial of his brother in the House of Lords.  Several other adventures and narrow escapes from death or serious injury make this installment in the Lord Peter series more action oriented than the companion pieces now available in their entirety to the public.
Clouds of Witness and all the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries are wonderfully entertaining.  The production values are consistently high and the acting is excellent, particularly Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter.  For an adult, literate audience, this is entertainment at its best.",997920000,10,1049,4.96
1224927,4,B00000INCJ,"I am an avid fan of the Lord Peter Wimsey novels and was greatly excited when they finally started releasing some of these on video.  Ian Carmichael does a fine job portraying the aristocratic sleuth and I especially enjoyed the performance of the actor who played Chief Inspector Charles Parker.  While you can tell that this was made in the 70's, the film is solid, well-acted, and as a whole sticks to the orginal novel written by Ms. Dorothy L. Sayers (except for the ending of which I think the book ending is more entertaining).  While I do prefer the Lord Peter series with Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter, these series of films with Mr. Carmichael are a wonderful addition for any Peter Wimsey fan.",977875200,3,713,4.688
1224928,5,B00000INCJ,"Long a devotee of Miss Marple and Poirot, I have just ""discovered"" Sayers and her Lord Peter Whimsey. Strangely enough, I began to read Sayers after coming across a chance comment about her work in a Christie novel! What a discovery! Lord Peter came to life for me in this video, both fun and suspense and all in that strange English upper-class grammar.  This video moves quickly through the tale while letting you become acquainted with each character one scene at a time. The photography is stunningly realized and the dialogue whitty and charming.  This is a great film for all of us out here who like the challenge of a good mystery played out in style and humor.",975110400,,668,4.605042016806722
1224929,3,B00000INCJ,"I have looked long and hard for these videos, and finally here's Peter and the family- but be forwarned. If you, like most Sayers fans, know exactly what Peter looks, talks and acts like- if you know how Denver sounds and  expect Sir Impey Biggs to be tall and spare and dignified- you'll have an  adjustment to make. Still, I've enjoyed the series for two reasons- I can  never really dislike Peter Wimsey in any form, and this is my chance to  introduce the last remaining non-fan in the household to the Wimsey world.  Carmichael is charming if too ""blocky"" and old to really play  Peter, but the essence of the story and characters is captured well.  Watching it with my faithful sheltie Wimsey at my feet made for a few  pleasant evenings. My advice, read the books again but then enjoy the  faintly familiar feeling you get from the pleasure of watching the story.",963360000,,870,4.561290322580645
1224930,2,B00000INCJ,"I did not see the original broadcast of the Lord Peter Wimsey series in the 70's.  I did see and very much enjoyed the 80's episodes with Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter.  When I purchased Clouds of Witness I  expected a better production with a Lord Peter who at least approximated  the character in the Sayers's mysteries.  The Lord Peter in Clouds is a  buffon, uncultured, clumsy and completely unlike the immaculately dressed  clothes horse of the books.  Bunter would have given up and taken up  photography for a living.  Also, five cassettes.  What a waste.  Takes up  way too much space for the caliber of the videos.  Last, the tapes  themselves are of poor quality.  Wait for the 80's series.",955929600,4,710,4.743801652892562
1224931,2,B00000INCJ,"I must disagree with the majority of reviewers. As a Dorothy Sayers fan but never having seen any of the TV broadcasts, I had high hopes for this video, but was deeply disappointed. Clouds of Witness was a too-literal  rendering of the book, tediously jumping from one clue to the next before  any clue had a chance to sink in (except one, perhaps the most important in  the whole story, which was so grossly over-emphasized that it may as well  have come with a voice-over saying ""Take notice, something very  important is being shown""). The teleplay offered very little of the  atmosphere or the finely-detailed depictions of English idiosyncracies  which gave Sayers's books their particular charm. The production itself was  theatrical (with stage-type lighting)and stagebound (confined in dim rooms,  except for a few sorry attempts at outdoor action scenes, all of them  utterly unconvincing). Aside from Peter Wimsey himself and the Dowager  Duchess, virtually every actor seemed miscast and the performances were  cold and unappealing. All combined, these factors gave the show an  amateurish, dated feel. And finally, the 200 minutes or so of actual  footage could have easily fit on two tapes instead of five, and been sold  for half the price.",951523200,4,1254,5.108374384236453
7911010,5,B00000INCJ,"Dorothy L. Sayers writes many non-fiction books however among her best is the Lord Peter Wimsey series. I came to this series sort of though the back door. My first taste was the BBC productions with Petherbridge as Lord Peter that can now be found on DVD ASIN: B000062XDX. So I read all of Dorothy's books containing the relationship of Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Now it is time to go through the whole series.
Now I watch the one I missed in PBS. The first thing I notices was that Ian Carmichael talks much faster than Petherbridge. And all the people seem older. Of course Peter was supposed to be older when he met Harriet.

Lord Peter returns from Corsica. To find his older brother the Duke of Denver (David Langton) practically accused of murder. What is worse is his brother is not talking. So it is up to Peter to find out what happened and clear his brother.
In the process he puts his foot in it and practically gets all his relatives and friends accused. As with all Sayers' stories nothing is simple there are overlapping plots and foolish deeds, as if Peter can not figure them out. On the side we learn a little about English society and ballistics.

They took the time to put just about everything relevant from the book in to this production. There were a few exceptions but not worth bothering about. The production is complete enough that you do not have to read the book.

I am glad they finally made a DVD version. However the one I watched was the tape series and I swear just as soon as you turn it on the part (episode) is over and it is time for the next tape as the story moves very fast.
This item is worth purchasing as you will want to replay it often.",1507766400,,1691,4.344936708860759
