8520669,5,B007PTZURC,"LOONS is quite rapidly becoming one of my favorite films. It revolves around a curse placed upon the male members of a family when, during the Salem Witch Trials, a certain Judge Loon sentences the one and only true witch to be burned at the stake.
  Generations pass...and within each of them insanity developes in the males of the Loon family. I don't do spoilers but I will say to watch for one particular sequence when young Lonny Loon expresses his desperation at the rising moon...
  I can honestly say this film is growing on me with each viewing. Micheal Legge is one of the most imaginitivly talented film makers of our time.
  Watch LOONS. It'll make your family seem more normal ( or, maybe it won't....I don't know your family! )  :)",1362096000,,745,4.556390977443609
