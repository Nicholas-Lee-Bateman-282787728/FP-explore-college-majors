3659951,5,B001JV5B4E,"Great show for younger kids, it has the kind of humour that makes kids 4-6 years old laugh and at the same time it teaches kids about common everyday items and the potential dangers they might have for creating fires.  Also creates a great role model for kids to follow and enjoy.",1251936000,,280,4.384615384615385
3659952,5,B001JV5B4E,"My 4 y/o loves Fireman Sam, and I agree. I love that he's a non licensed character, meaning we can walk through stores w/o being assaulted with Norman Price Macaroni and Cheese. The stories are cute, no violence, no questionable or sassy language or story lines, and positive age-appropriate lessons like tell the truth, benefits of teamwork, be kind to your friends, practice fire safety, etc. While I think my son will still enjoy this show when he's 7 or 8, it's nice to know that it's appropriate for someone his age.

Here's the episodes--Amazon should include this on all DVD descriptions like they do for music.

--Fields of Fire
--Norman's Invisible Friend
--High Jinx
--Pizza Palaver
--Firefighter of Tomorrow
Bonus Episode: Roary The Racing Car

I highly recommend all of the Fireman Sam series!

Oh, and if you're a stop-motion fan, try Wallace and Grommit shorts, really cute, although Wrong Trousers may be scary for under 4 IMO.",1250380800,20,942,4.90566037735849
3659953,4,B001JV5B4E,"It's a good quality video.  I had bought it based upon Amazon recommendations, although my 2 1/2 year old son never watched ""Fireman Sam"" prior to this video.  So, I wasn't aware of the accents or content.  I was skeptical at first, but he loves it and it's a nice change from Barney and Elmo.

My only complaints are that they show junk food alot on this video, so I am constantly getting requests for ""ice cream"" and other stuff during and after the video.  I also was a little disturbed by the potential drowning scene, even though it turns out okay in the end.",1244505600,,564,4.333333333333333
3659954,5,B001JV5B4E,"OMG!!!we got this for our son for Easter, and he won't stop waching it.  He loves the little vidos that they have on tv.  So I found this one and he loves it.",1239667200,,158,3.757575757575758
3659955,5,B001JV5B4E,Fireman Sam Saves the Day is family friendly with a lesson in each episode.  There are several short episodes in which you meet the residents of a town in Whales.  It's funny and very tolerable for parents to watch too.  My son loves this series as most little boys tend to love firefighters.  I would recommend both this and Fireman Sam to the Rescue.,1238716800,,352,4.453125
3659956,5,B001JV5B4E,"Our family really likes all of the Fireman Sam videos. We bought them primarily for our 3 year old son but I've got to admit, I watch them with him because they are so well done.

The characters are great and once you know them you will be looking for more episodes. Fireman Sam, Norman Price, Mandy, Bella and Tom are my favorites but the whole cast is great. ""I'm going in"", ""Norman Price, you little hooligan/cheat/et all"", ""Great fires of London"", ""Flaming qualas"" are some of the signature lines. You will be greatly enjoying these episodes if you give them a chance.

They are based in Wales so for Americans you will have to learn a few words which also adds to appeal. Highly recommended",1237680000,,695,4.507936507936508
3659957,5,B001JV5B4E,"I ordered this for my 4 1/2 year old, and both he and his 24 month old brother have loved watching it over and over again!  It shows in a basic way, how firefighters use different equipment, and make different kinds of rescues.  Definitely worth watching.",1236556800,,255,4.521739130434782
3659958,5,B001JV5B4E,"My grandson is a great fan of the Sprout Network.  Fireman Sam is his favorite and he likes to pretend HE is Sam while watching the video.  This video gets an A+ as an attention-getter and a great learning tool.

3659959,5,B001JV5B4E,My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves Fireman Sam.  We could not find it anywhere at our local Target or Toy R Us...thank goodness for Amazon.,1234742400,,144,4.538461538461538
3659970,5,B001JV5B4E,This is a great video.  My son watches it over and over and over.  It is a good learning/teaching tool for various incidents and other matters.,1294790400,,143,4.461538461538462
3659971,5,B001JV5B4E,"Our son started out watching the older Fireman Sam videos on cable when he was 2. Then recently, our cable provider switched to the newer version. He loves this video of older episodes, and I love that there are several together so I don't have to keep the remote near by to select another episode. Great stuff! We bought the other videos too.",1273968000,4,343,4.4603174603174605
3659972,5,B001JV5B4E,"My son loves Fireman Sam and this dvd fits the bill! I like that this was done using the old ""animation"", not the new computer generated look they are showing now. As always, Fireman Sam teaches a message, whether it be fire safety or the right way to behave (by showing how Norman misbehaves!!). As an adult this is one of my favorite things to watch also!!",1272412800,,358,4.358208955223881
3659973,4,B001JV5B4E,My grandsons 2-4 loved this video.  They learned a little about fire fighting and a lot about helping.  A very positive video,1267833600,,125,4.636363636363637
3659974,5,B001JV5B4E,My 3 year-old son is a firefighter enthusiast and he loves Fireman Sam. He watches the DVD's often and the lessons are good so I don't need to worry about what he's learning.,1265760000,,174,4.303030303030303
3659975,4,B001JV5B4E,"My five year-old loves this DVD, although I'm not sure how he understands everything they say because the characters speak with such a heavy dialect.  Also, I was a little surprised when I watched it because I thought it was computer-animated, like the previous ones I have seen, but the characters are clay figures.  Either way, my son adores all the short stories in this DVD and they teach good lessons.",1265328000,2,406,4.704225352112676
3659976,1,B001JV5B4E,"The content of these DVDs is great. My son loves Fireman Sam. That being said, HIT/Lionsgate has created these DVDs so that you have to sit through several minutes of previews to get to the autoplay feature. Then, when you select autoplay, you have to sit through the previews again before you can watch the program. Anyone with an impatient two-year-old can imagine what a pain this is. Shame on HIT/Lionsgate for forcing this on consumers.",1262649600,2,441,4.815789473684211
3659977,5,B001JV5B4E,"My 2 year old is obsessed with Fireman Sam, this DVD is part of the better 2nd production, stop motion animation. Better quality than the first run and much more enjoyable than the new Computer Animated version.",1257465600,,211,4.72972972972973
3659978,4,B001JV5B4E,"My son loves this dvd. He watches it all the time, knows the dialogue, etc. Five great stories a child can enjoy over and over again.",1256860800,4,133,4.153846153846154

8313820,5,B001JV5B4E,"My kids love the Fireman Sam videos. They teach safety while also having a great story theme to go along with it. Both of my sons love firemen, so these series of movies are perfect!",1379548800,,182,4.228571428571429
8313821,5,B001JV5B4E,These were the first of the Fireman Sam's and are done in claymation.  There are more characters in the older series and my three year old grandson loves them,1366329600,,158,4.448275862068965
8313822,5,B001JV5B4E,"I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He is almost 4. He has watched Fireman Sam on tv and was delighted to have his own video that he could watch whenever he wants. In addition to his fireman pjs, and fireman dress up costume, he now has the video-- he couldn't be happier!! Parents love it too- very well done!",1325116800,,319,4.245901639344262
8313823,3,B001JV5B4E,I would not have ordered this DVD had I realized it was clay animation and not a cartoon like the episodes we watch on TV. The clay is very different and my son didn't seem to be as into it. We ordered two Fireman Sam DVD's at once. One DVD is clay and one is regular. I am disappointed that the description of the DVD's does not specify which type of Animation is used.,1324684800,,370,4.013513513513513
