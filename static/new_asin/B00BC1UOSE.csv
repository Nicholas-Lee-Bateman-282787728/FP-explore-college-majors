8565749,5,B00BC1UOSE,This movie is very engaging and topical. The lead is very good as are the supporting actors. The story is very believable yet difficult to watch. I do like this kind of film even though it can be a very dark and uncomfortable experience. This is a movie that elicits strong feelings one way or the other. The A/V is very good.,1374278400,,326,4.274193548387097
