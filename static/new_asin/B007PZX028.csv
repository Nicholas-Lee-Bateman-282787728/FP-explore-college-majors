8520907,2,B007PZX028,Not a lot of details about Iron Maiden.  Mostly talked about British rock music.  Was a gift to my husband who is a huge Maiden fan and he was very disappointed.  Which made me disappointed that I spent $25 bucks on this when I could have bought him an Iron Maiden tshirt instead.,1346025600,10,280,4.245283018867925
