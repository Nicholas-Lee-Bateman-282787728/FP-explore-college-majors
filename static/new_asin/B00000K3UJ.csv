8243333,2,B00000K3UJ,"Look at date of this film. It was produced in 1938 and not 2000 or 1999.  This has nothing to do with the modern film the only thing they have in  common is the title, folks. BTW, see the modern film. GLADIATORS is great.  Hope it comes DVD soon.",968025600,14,246,3.979591836734694

8243335,5,B00000K3UJ,"Gladiator is a jam packed Roman Empire lovers movie!  It stars Russel Crowe who does a wonderful job portraying a former general for the Roman  army now gladiator/slave.  This is an excellent thriller for all people too  see, even if you hate history this is a must see!",966470400,3,270,4.5625
