8538049,4,B0099GMLFS,"Thank God I have received my copy of Verdi With a Vengeance, whose writer appreciates this opera much more than I did on first viewing  It is a Donizetti/Rossini pastiche sung aptly but not spectaculary by a houseful of Verdian stalwarts from the  Teatro Reggio di Parma.  The only other record of it shows a newer performance of the same production.  Anna Caterina Antonacci, sounded tentative at the beginning but then found her voice.  Cecilia Gasdia was superb from her very entrance. The male voices were adequate, but I found the tenor Demetrio Rabitto almost unbearably fortissimo.  Beautiful staging, showing that traditional does not necessarily mean boring.  How I wish his role had a Diego Florez in it!  And it is the only DVD of this opera.  By now I have all 26 of Verdi's operas.",1436313600,,794,4.779411764705882
