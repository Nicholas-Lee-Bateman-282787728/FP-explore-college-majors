5981573,1,B00FEOYY8G,"It should not be surprising as Universal is always the dvd concern the least likely to include extras in their releases; well now they're not even releasing them properly. Bought the first five seasons. I will never, I repeat, never buy this crap!",1383177600,38,247,4.767441860465116
5981574,1,B00FEOYY8G,"Why, oh, why Universal did you not release these as regular DVD's as you did the first five wonderful sets?  Okay, I understand that DVD sales are declining and that those who collect these shows are part of a small, niche audience.  But clearly Universal sees some money in front of them, so why not keep with tradition and do it right?  Why are these available in some parts of the world as standard DVDs, yet here, we get cheap, made-to-order DVD-Rs?  It's too bad Universal didn't just license these out to a wonderful company like, say, Shout to distribute if they had so little faith in its continued popularity.

Like Hitchcock, Universal, you left us in suspense for over a year to get this volume.  And now that it's finally on the horizon, you botched the ending.",1383177600,122,773,4.565217391304348
5981575,1,B00FEOYY8G,"I own the first five seasons of Alfred Hitchcock presents and was looking forward to the next to be released. I was initially excited when I saw this until I noticed that it was to be a DVD-R. I have purchased DVD-Rs before and they do not stand up in quality or durability. Certainly not worth the increased cost this one demonstrates.

So to be clear, I am rating the format of the product, not the series itself. This television show deserves better. If an actual DVD should be released, I will buy it.",1383091200,27,505,4.372340425531915
5981576,1,B00FEOYY8G,"Apparently the first 5 Seasons didn't sell well enough to get a ""real"" release!
 While I'm glad it's from Amazon and not a more expensive MOD service, I
can't see how the previous seasons sold so poorly that that we get this...
I would love if there was some way to verify the image quality before spending
money on this and it also makes me wonder if the series will ever be finished...
  This doesn't seem too optimistic for the Hitchcock Hour to ever be released.
  Also, these sets were packaged nicely and I don't want a front cover in an Amaray
case that doesn't match.
  Hopefully the lack of a release date is Universal reconsidering!",1382572800,55,642,4.482758620689655
5981577,5,B00FEOYY8G,"About five years ago I already had the first three seasons released from the factory and someone sold me seasons 4 to 7 on a marketing website of cable TV downloads he had captured in Canada.  I enjoyed watching them, however, I still buy each of the seasons when they are released from the factory because these have always been a high-quality realease and accomplished to perfection.  They are initially expensive but worth every penny in entertainment value.  I already know season 6 and 7 are excellent mini-stories!

I waited years for the first season to be released and have been ever thrilled with each release from the factory.  I won't pre-order because the guarantee on delivery starts ticking once the money is transferred with some sites.  I will patiently wait for the official release date.

As soon as I get my season 6 edition I will be watching them every night until I have seen them all!",1381968000,2,907,4.7025316455696204

Looks and plays like the other 5 seasons-except for the price and a synopsis of each episode. Not sure about the longevity of the discs. I'll probably outlive them,though.

I have been checking every day, Only to no avail. But lo and behold, on Sept 26th @ 8:01 pm EST, I logged onto Amazon and saw that season 6 has FINALLY been released. I no doubt know this season will be as good as the past 5 season's....the introduction by none other then Mr Hitchcock and the ever surprising ending always leaves this viewer saying ""Boy that was a great episode""...THANK YOU TO WHOM EVER IS RESPONSIBLE for releasing this season...I will pre-order as soon as this review is completed....",1380240000,16,623,4.426086956521739

5981585,2,B00FEOYY8G,"The show itself gets a 5 star rating.  I docked stars because unfortunately I've had a disk issue.  The problem, especially with tv series, is that if you don't get around to viewing ALL the disks within the allotted ""returns window"", you may only find the problem too late.  I've been watching these episodes sporadically & have now just found an issue with disk 3, specifically with the episode ""The Landlady"".  If refuses to play on various dvd & blu ray players.  The machines make a HORRID sound upon trying to play the episode & locks up the entire machine.  Now I'm stuck with a bum disk & no way to return it.  Additionally, I may have yet to found all the issues with the rest of the disks since I haven't gotten that far watching yet.  There may be more problems on disks 4 & 5.  So unfortunately a bad purchase for me.  These manufactured on demand disks seem to always be problematic.  But yet they keep insisting on making them this shoddy way.  A real bummer.  Why Universal can't provide a proper release of the seasons from 6 forward is beyond me.  I suppose they haven't felt like they've had their coffers filled enough with the earlier seasons.  C'mon folks!  It's HITCHCOCK for cripes sake.  All the garbage that gets a proper release & we have this MOD junk for Hitch?  A blow to film humanity!  I hadn't had an issue with seasons 1-5 which I've purchased religiously at full price.  The manufacture on demand starts with this season & boom, problems arise.  I'm anxiously awaiting season 7's availability & hopefully then the Alfred Hitchcock Hour seasons as well.  But if it's going to be more suspect MOD material I need to be more vigilant in watching the entire season within the month return window.  Stinks.  A rare ""miss"" from Amazon for me on this one.  They've been my ""go to"" for purchases for eons.  Bad deal.",1494201600,2,1842,4.522796352583587
5981586,2,B00FEOYY8G,"First off, the content is at it's usual excellence; I have no problems there. AHP is one of the best series ever done in American television with a high percentage of good to great stories in each of the 6 seasons I've purchased and watched. Sure, there's the occasional clinker, but tastes vary and I really love the story themes from that period.

The problem is with this latest edition, and the shortcuts and poor production of the collection and physical product. The previous 5 seasons (BLUE) were done as a 3-fold case that insert into a nice box. Each of the discs fit securely into a clear recessed panel over an episode photo montage. The back of each panel contains an episode listing with title and story description. The on-screen selection interface also shows this title and episode summary along with a thumbnail photo. The thumbnail photo is an easy way to remember an episode and title connection.

This 6th season edition (YELLOW) replaced the box-set design with a cheap plastic DVD case, without any episode listings or descriptions. The case center spindles were broken on 3 out of 6, preventing those discs from staying in place. The on-screen selection interface is ""title-only"", sans description and photo, so it's a challenge to connect an episode with it's title for later viewing. The final indignity was the discovery of a pressing defect on one of the discs that lock-up the player during that episode.

Several more seasons of AHP await release. Let's hope they return to the previous seasons release format--Alfred deserves it!",1490140800,12,1559,4.920152091254753
5981587,5,B00FEOYY8G,"For the past 3 years, I was skeptical on buying Season Six, due to all the negative comments.  But as I finally started seeing more positive comments over the past year or so, I decided to give it a shot.  I finally picked up Season Six in early February, and glad I made the purchase.  First and foremost, I ended up getting it for about $25 less than what it initially cost when it first came out.  And that was when it was getting slammed with the negative comments.  When it arrived, I immediately threw in disc number 4, and all episodes played without issue, as did all the other episodes in the set.  There's 5 discs in the set, and the disc menu is pretty basic, giving you an option to play individual episodes, or all that are on the disc (about 7 - 8 episodes per disc).  If I had to give 1 nay say about the set, it would be the jewel case.  It's pretty much a piece of garbage that doesn't hold the discs in place.  Fortunately, they arrived in tact when delivered.  But after taking the discs out to play, they now never stay in place when putting them back.  So to avoid any damage, I placed them into a DVD storage case, and that was the end of that problem.  Now the jewel case sits empty on the DVD shelf, next to it's brothers Seasons 1 - 5.  Now if we can only get Season 7 to join the family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1489104000,4,1332,4.15625

""O Youth and Beauty,"" ""The Horseplayer,"" and ""Incident in a Small Jail"" stand out in this collection. ""Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat,"" based on a Roald Dahl story, is another classic, directed by Sir Alfred. ""Summer Shade"" with Julie Adams and James Franciscus is also a delight. As usual the acting is splendid. Claude Rains, Peter Falk, Audrey Meadows, Gena Rowlands, Arthur Hill, Walter Matthau, Dick York, Rip Torn, Keenan Wynn, Leslie Nielsen, and a young Sydney Pollack as a camp counselor are all noteworthy.

The discs don't appear to be CD-R but rather silver manufactured discs. They have lithographed labels. My version was in a case with one central spindle stacking the discs. I was able to play disc 4 on my laptop drive. The case quality is lacking the same quality of the other 5 US volumes, but other than that, no issues. Discs have menus showing episode names and a ""play all"" option. There was no crazy file structure (at least on disc 5). I took a chance on this one base on all the negative reviews but was satisfied. Photos show Vol 6 and for comoarison Vol 5 which I also received today. Now if only I had a zone free player and Vol 7 and the 3 seasons of the Alfred Hitchcock Hour not available in US versions. Something to consider.",1472774400,20,882,4.255952380952381

5981610,5,B00FEOYY8G,"Here's a suggestion to all who might be concerned about problems with disk 4: Buy an all-region DVD player and order the Region 4 set produced by MADMAN in Australia. Their disks are pressed, not burned in DVD-r's and, like the USA version, the entire season 6 is produced with the full co-operation of Universal Studios.

I just got my set in this afternoon, and of course, went straight to disk 4. With half the episodes on it now behind me, I'm happy to report that there were absolutely no problems with either freezing or skipping. The images themselves are sparklingly clear, save for the usual flecks at the beginning of each episode, which we Hitchcock Presents DVD viewers are all too familiar with. Again, like their USA counterparts, all appear to be sourced from original 35 mm camera negatives. The cover art is compatible with our seasons 1-5, and the price, even figuring in the cost of shipping, is about the same as what Amazon charges.

I'd previously purchased seasons 4-8 of Ironside from MADMAN, when it became obvious that Universal would not finish the series in Region 1. To date, I have not had the slightest problem with any of them.

MADMAN offers a viable alternative for completests like me looking to build a library full of trouble-free entertainment.",1444694400,6,1282,4.791855203619909

All had an on-screen menu of only the eight or seven episodes on that disc, which is as it should be.  Chances are the problem was corrected after numerous complaints from early purchasers.

It's unfortunate that Season 6 was issued on a did-r (that is, manufactured to order) because it delays delivery and costs more than the other Hitchcock seasons.  Also, there isn't a single damn program note inside nor ever a bare-books listing of the titles and actors on each disc.  For $40-plus, every purchaser deserves better.

The previous season sets are nice with the episode guides and such on each of the box sets. This Season 6 set is different from the rest because it's a DVD-R format and episode descriptions are not provided. The set however does feature 38-Episodes of the shows Sixth Season with Great Picture Quality and Sound. It's also nice to see the menu design for this release feature the episode list on each DvD with the Hitchcock Theme in the background - similar to the other sets. Another bonus is that many episodes include the Revue Studios / Universal Logo during the closing credits which is not seen often in the other releases. I'm very happy this season was released for fans of this series so that we can enjoy these episodes again.

5981637,5,B00FEOYY8G,"I saw a few episodes of this season and they were as good as previous seasons.

Ignore the complaints about it being released as a DVD-R. Better to be happy that they released it at all. Amazon will replace defective sets.

DVD-R's are a good way for the studios to get low-demand titles into our hands with high quality video. The manufacturing cost of DVD-ROM's (the ""standard"" DVD's) is much too high for many such titles. Life expectancy of both formats is not known, but estimates put it at 50+ years and some estimates exceed 100 years.

DVD-ROM's are subject to deterioration as well. Your storage and handling will have more to do with deterioration than anything else. If you are really concerned about deterioration, you should probably be backing these up on a hard drive. In any case, how many DVD players do you think will be around in 20-30 years?",1418083200,5,861,4.651315789473684

5981642,5,B00FEOYY8G,Extremely happy with the newest Hitchcock TV presentation season 6. Absolutely no problem with any of the discs nor any problem with the lip sync or sepia episodes. It states right on the box to note that the discs will only play on a play device only so you take a chance playing it on another medium. These are the best looking episodes I have yet to see from Universal-awaiting season 7.,1411084800,2,390,4.430555555555555
5981643,1,B00FEOYY8G,"Well I've read the complaints below about Universal being (fill-in-the-blank) for releasing this on DVD-R. For those of you who are puzzled by this action, I have a few observations that may make it more understandable (but no less non-acceptable). First off, remember how Comcast bought NBC? Well, it was NBC/Universal they bought, which means THE CABLE COMPANY NOW OWNS UNIVERSAL and all the classic Universal Monsters... now that is truly frightening! Secondly, I have seen this burn-on-demand trend increase tremendously in the past year or so. Look at all the Warner Brothers western TV series (many of which had at least the first season released on conventional DVD)  as MOD (manufacture on demand - which means DVD-R). Some of the advance ad-copy on the releases state words to the effect ""due to anticipated high demand, initial copies will be released as conventional DVDs""  Why all this? I am postulating here, but it seems that as more & more time is being spent on Blu Ray releases, less & less is being spent on Red Ray (standard DVDs). Add to that the increasing numbers of people willing to pay to watch online, the still-declining economy (as far as the public at large is concerned - do you have more or less free cash to spend than you did two years ago?); you can see why BIG BUSINESS is doing this. Thank God for people like Olive Films, who go after the lesser appeal movies, make their deals with Paramount, and release conventional DVDs. As for poor Alfred here, even when times were good it was at least 1 or 2 years between release dates of the next season. What can we do about it? Seek out the nostalgia-type broadcast channels (like MeTV, which currently runs the one hour episodes; seasons 8-10) and burn them to your own DVD-Rs. It won't match the quality of a conventional release, but it is a LOT better than doing without (or paying $40+ bucks for a bad MOD edition). What a pleasure it is for me to be able to watch The Life Work of Juan Diaz (the creepiest Halloween episode of any TV series ever filmed), The Sign of Satan (Chris Lee's first US TV appearence) and The Magic Shop any time I want. Then, hope that once the Blu Ray pressings catch up with what the Big Guys feel are all the high demand items, they will go back to conventional pressings (Blu Ray this time) of the shows we all love so dearly! Season 6 is the last remaing season I need for a complete collection. But after reading these reviews, there is NO WAY I am going to purchase it until the bad 4th disc problem is rectifiede! P.S. did you notice how Amazon Warehouse Deals has a few unwrapped copies to sell on the cheap? What are the odds that those are returns from buyers who would not put up with a bad disc? Yet they resell it, knowingly aware of the bad disc. That is just criminal IMHO. And Amazon, forgive me if I am wrong about this, but you will have to PROVE to me the reason you have an unrapped copy  is NOT because of it being a return for that bad disc before I will buy it",1410912000,14,2997,4.425724637681159

Its so easy to get online and get synopsis for every season and every episode-who needs subtitles? I am a long time hitchcock fan, and have all his movies, and hours of hitch presents and the hitch hour on dvds I have transferred from vcr tapes. The years of reruns usually showed the same limited episodes, so there are many of these I had not seen. Ditto for seasons 1 through 5-which I got here at amazon. This set is priceless, as are all the rest. This is the first time I have read reviews-(and I read lots-and submit lots of my own to help others) that are negative and faulty and not true at all.",1405209600,4,771,4.361111111111111

5981650,1,B00FEOYY8G,"WARNING

This DVD is a DVD-R, it has no subtitle, being French and not totally bilingual, I appreciate the Use them as standard support for a better understanding.
The 5 first season are good, but this sixth season is a disgrace.

On my region free DVD player, disc 4 works as well as all DVD provided (am i lucky?), but a company such as UNIVERSAL can not settle for an amateur work.
UNIVERSAL does not care about customers, I waited impatiently for season 7, I'm in doubt now.

Only buy if you are aware of lower quality, otherwise you will be disappointed.",1401753600,15,559,4.46078431372549
5981651,4,B00FEOYY8G,"On a few episodes, the sound was out of sync with the actors' voices. Otherwise, the set was quite enjoyable. I eagerly anticipate the release of season #7.",1401580800,,156,4.607142857142857
5981652,1,B00FEOYY8G,"I purchased this as ""used in new condition"" (with no defects visible on the discs), but had to return the set.  Aware of the problems noted by other reviewers, I attempted to play the discs.  The infamous Disc 4 (which has a lot of ""garbage data"" thereon) would not play at all, although there are ways for those of you out there with expertise to extract the good files from the bad.  Two other discs would freeze up, and two seemingly would play well.  What I was able to view was not bad video, but not excellent either.  People have mentioned the MOD (Made On Demand) format, but it's really the files being burned during that process than the process itself -- although there's also the issue of having more ""permanent"" pressed discs.

It's a shame Universal didn't issue the remainder of this series (to date) with proper care and ""commercial"" DVDs, and they should correct that in the future, properly re-releasing this set and Season 7 as well, if that sees the light of day in a Region 1 release.  The only thing that mitigates my disappointment here is that Season 6 and Season 7 are the final two half hour seasons.  And most of those get good play in some type of syndicated form (set your DVD recorder, folks!).  Also, despite a great episode here and there, those two seasons do not compare that favorably to some of the earlier seasons.  I never really was that fond of the later Alfred Hitchcock Hour shows (which are also syndicated), which suffer from scripts that generally would have been better presented in a half hour format (although there are obviously exceptions to that).  So I am probably out by the time the hour shows are released in the U.S., if ever.

For those of you who are completists, the Season 6 episodes are not ""terrible,"" assuming that the Disc 4 problems (especially) have been corrected to a ""playable"" solution.  But you'll still be paying a fairly high amount for a DVD product that does not boast great video or any extras.  I'm not sure if any fixes for the infamous Disc 4 also included providing a title menu, another feature mentioned by some as lacking.  So be aware of what you're getting and not getting here, and also be advised that my one star rating refers to the quality of the production of the DVD product, not to the content of the shows themselves.",1400803200,19,2311,4.548309178743962
5981653,1,B00FEOYY8G,"Unfortunately, it looks like Alfred Hitchcock fans can expect garbage from Comcast now that Universal is 100% all theirs. Too bad its all about profits & not quality or customer satisfaction. This DVD set is certainly a downgrade from the pre-Comcast sets. I understand that DVDs might not be as profitable as in the past, but come on!  Its BARE BONES and some of the skeleton is missing!!!  No episode descriptions? No subtitles, even though the box says so?  Defective disks out of the box?  A microscopic disclaimer on the back of the case about this set being good for  ""Play only"" devises and not playing on recorders and PCs?  I mean, really, are you kidding? Why do we all have to feel like dinosaurs for still wanting quality, workable Region 1 DVDs for our money? Only my love for the excellent content of Alfred Hitchcock Presents made me order a replacement for this poorly presented set.  His show always gets 5 stars with me.

P.S. I got a replacement set pronto from Amazon and all disks work fine. Still no subtitles :(
If they do season 7 let's hope it's better quality.",1399161600,28,1086,4.590673575129534

I will try to be patient a little longer with high hopes!!

1. The created-on-demand format stinks vs. ""factory"" sets, for video and audio, based on more than a few prior experiences I've had.
2. No subtitles = NO SALE to those of us with measurable hearing loss; (I'm only 56.).
Oh, I'd love to be heroic and say that I lost 40% of my hearing while overseas defending America from terrorists, but the armed forces wouldn't take me unless the whole Iranian army was marching down Broadway.

What I did was slowly backtrack to just after the scene froze  (this took many tries to get to the perfect place) and then was able to play to the end from that point so nothing in the story was missed.  It first happened in a story about an artistic boy at camp who prefers modeling clay to outdoor sports; it froze at an indoor cabin scene.  The second time it froze in a Peter Falk bar scene only a few minutes into the story.

That said, I have to agree with the majority of other reviewers here....Universal should have put more effort into manufacturing a better product, particularly in the Alfred Hitchcock genre.  I would like to see the same quality that went into producing the first five seasons, which are excellent.  As for the lack of episode guide with this season, here's one suggestion:  beg, borrow or steal a copy of the ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS COMPANION (I bought mine here on Amazon), and you're good to go.  I typed up my own condensed listing of the episodes on the five discs, printed it, and attached it to the fly leaf on the DVD case.  Voila!  Problem solved.

It made horrible sounds, wouldn't ""catch"" so it could play, skipped, stopped/froze for no reason, and parts would not play.

5981675,1,B00FEOYY8G,"Several other reviewers have complained about not being able to play disc 4 of Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season 6.  My DVD player could not play discs 1, 2, 4, and 5 of my Season 6.  Disc 3 played well.  When these discs hung up my DVD player, I could not eject them or turn off my DVD player with the power button.  I had to unplug my DVD player to turn it off.  When I plugged it in and turned it on again, I held down the eject button to eject the disc before it could hang it up again.

I got the same results when I tried to play one of these discs with the DVD player application in my computer.  I had to force quit the DVD player program.  My computer would not shut down, so I had to do a forced shutdown.

Then I examined the unplayable discs in my computer.  Disc 1 contained 1085 files in the Video TS folder.  The directory information indicated that the size of the Video TS folder was 748 GB (on a DVD with 8 GB of capacity).  Disc 3 (the playable disc) had 17 files in the Video TS folder, and the folder size was 7.4 GB.  Disc 3 was not copy protected.

The convoluted copy protection system on the unplayable discs had bogus information about the number of files and the amount of data in these files.  This was meant to confuse a DVD copy program designed to break the copy protection and copy the DVD.  This type of protection also confused my DVD player and my computers DVD player application.

The protection that prevents copying of these discs also prevents playing of these discs in many DVD players.  These discs are both copy protected and play protected.

I then used a very good DVD ripper program that could sort out the good video files from the garbage video files and was able to extract a working copy.  A copy of disc 1 had 18 files in the Video TS folder and 7.66 GB of video data (very reasonable information).  The 1067 garbage video files were gone.  I used the same procedure to obtain working copies of discs 2, 4, and 5.  I burned new discs from the extracted information, and all of the new discs played well.

I should not have to go to this much trouble to get playable discs from a purchased DVD set.  This overpriced set of purchased discs should be playable right out of the package.  If I returned this Season 6 set of unplayable discs, Amazon would probably send me another set of unplayable discs.  I will keep this original unplayable Season 6 for two reasons:  1.) I like Alfred Hitchcocks TV shows; 2.) I don't want to be accused of piracy.  If anyone asks, Ill be happy to demonstrate that the original discs are unplayable, and the extracted copies play very well.  If I have to extract playable copies from unplayable originals, I don't consider that piracy.

The problems encountered by numerous people with MOD (manufactured on demand) DVDs will probably kill that method of marketing.  I don't expect to see Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season 7.  I would advise against purchasing MOD DVDs unless:  1.) You really, really, really want the shows on those DVDs; 2.) You have a very good computer and DVD ripping program capable of sorting its way through this garbage type of copy protection.

I had to create my own to store in the case. I suggest that fellow ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" enthusiasts such as myself do not boycott this set. I cannot argue with the fact that this set is higher priced than it should be. However, poor sales of this season may result in season 7 never being released. If sales were what they should have been for past seasons. Universal wouldn't have made the poor and unfortunate decision to release this season on the dvd-rom ""made on demand"" format in the first place.",1388620800,4,843,4.552631578947368
5981684,3,B00FEOYY8G,"Many (justified) disparaging words have been posted about this release.  I relunctanly purchased it as it became evident that Universal would not release Season 6 as in the previous five seasons.  I suppose it's better than nothing. There are absolutely no supplemental materials in this edition.  The disc allows you to play the episodes but there is no descriptive information included to guide you to a particular episode.  I guess if there's such a thing as a ""Hitchcock Presents"" episode guide you could refer to that.  Otherwise you're reduced to a ""hunt and peck"" system in order to sort through this mess.  The good news is that the video quality of these episodes are not appreciably different from previous releases.  Somebody has really punched us in the gut with this one.  Whoever is responsible should be ashamed.  I don't guess there's any hope for a future release rectifying this so we can look forward to the rest of the seasons being released in like manner, and that's not a sure thing.  Oh well...

Since orignally reviewing this product, it occurred to me that giving it a single star is a bit unfair.  ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" happened to be one of my favorite TV series ever.  If merely reviewing the content of Season 6, I would easily have given it 4 stars.  There are some great episodes included in that season.  For that reason I'm bumping up my original rating to 3 stars.  I can't overlook the bare bones treatment given but on the other hand some consideration must be given to the quality of the shows.  It amazes me that a company like Universal couldn't follow through and be consistent/faithful to the format created in the first five seasons.

I suppose for the sake of completion this release will have to do.  It's better than nothing.",1388620800,7,1777,4.748366013071895
5981685,4,B00FEOYY8G,"I only recently found out that Season 6 of Alfred Hitchcock Presents was on DVD. This was when I opened it on Christmas Day (thanks to my wife who purchased it for me!!).

I'd like to discuss my particular set. I see many people on here are complaining that their DVDs don't play properly. I already watched 4/5 discs and they all played fine. Let's hope disc 5 works just as well. The only season that gave me trouble was season 1. However I FINALLY came across a good copy so I now have good copies of seasons 1-6. All we need now is season 7 and all of Alfred Hitchcock Presents will be available on DVD. I'd also like to note that the packaging of season 6 is different than other seasons. This one is in a simple snap case while seasons 1-5 were released in fold-over cases that gave episode descriptions. Universal is getting lazy I presume.

Next, I'll discuss the episodes themselves. So far, season 6 has some of the show's best episodes. A favorite of mine is ""Contest For Aaron Gold"", a great tale of a boy at a children's camp who is eager for an upcoming ceramics display. Aaron Gold would rather work on his clay knight than swim and play ball which gets the camp's main instructor mad. Curiosity comes about when Aaron refuses to put a second arm on his knight. Other interesting episode I came across are ""A Very Moral Theft"", ""O Youth And Beauty"", ""Sybilla"" among others. Season 6 is great for moral stories mixed with suspense.

In conclusion, season six is a great season of AHP. Now I'm not sure if I was lucky on this or maybe Universal fixed this set, but mine was fine. The quality was possibly better than any other season because I didn't see much film grain or black lines running through the episodes here. Universal really cleaned up the quality a bit here. I'd buy this set, and simply return if defective and get a replacement.",1388620800,3,1857,4.423976608187134

A limited dvd-r edition reveals your company to be weak, ineffectual, and lacking confidence in its own product. 3) Without subtitles, you're displaying insensitivity to the deaf, hard-of-hearing, and non-English speaking audience---all of whom will be passing on this set. And finally, 4) You're being short-sighted in  the sense that some people out there (former customers included) would definitely buy a larger (possibly blu-ray) box set of 6 or more seasons--much like The Twilight Zone or Dick Van Dyke sets.

In conclusion, Universal--you're a big company, so act like a big company.

As it is now, you're acting like a store afraid to spend any money on inventory. The result of which is--nothing to buy and no profits whatsoever for you.

If it indicates 99 titles on the dvd (instead of 9 or 10 titles), you might consider requesting a replacement set to be on the safe side.

Aside from the now-corrected playability problem, I have a couple gripes. Already noted by reviews, unlike the minted dvd sets, this one lacks subtitles and an episode list with short synopsis.
A few episodes have a kind of snowy overlay (ie, D5 Secret Life), more noticeable in dark scenes. Perhaps it's made worse by the nicely sharp transfers, or upconversion thru home HDMI connections. Lowering your dvd player/TV setting to ""Movie/Cinema"" (instead of ""Standard"" or ""Vivid"") will darken the picture slightly and reduce the snowy appearance in those episodes.
8 episodes have a greenish hue instead of being b&w. It's not always noticeable, and you can always turn off your TV's color, but they should have corrected it:
D1: Very moral theft; Contest for Aaron Gold; Outlaw in Town.
D2: Man who found the money

If online ratings are any reflection, Season Six is probably the second most loved season of Alfred Hitchcock's half-hour long format television show after Season Five. His stories certainly picked up speed and the style of them in Season Six have gotten grittier, more ""American"" and less ""British"".

The discs are exactly what you expect out of a DVD-R, which is a custom-manufactured DVD that lacks anything other than the material. They are made to keep costs down for titles that are expected to be slow sellers; they are the hallmark of the decline of the DVD and recorded media in general.

I understand everyone's complaints about the DVD-R format. I hate it too. Reality has to set in though. If Season Six doesn't sell well there may not be a Season seven or Universal Editions of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour either. These discs don't have anything except a ""Play All"" or play a specific scene selections. DVDs are in decline, sales are down, and if all trends continue, they will continue to decline. Studios can't afford to spend all the setup costs to make DVD sets for TV shows (or movies) that aren't going to sell enough units to recoup costs. So, short of everybody wanting a copy buying three or four sets, DVD-R is the least risky move the studios can make. I'll keep buying them, if they come out, in summary. I'd rather have a s***ty DVD-R set than nothing. Really, at the end of the day, the reason I think people are upset by the DVD-Rs is that its insulting. Universal almost wants to be saying ""You're love of our shows isn't enough. There aren't enough of you and there isn't enough demand for the show(s) you love."" I get how the critical reviewers feel, I feel the same way.

I have another complaint, one that is special to me. I like subtitles (English SDH) on DVDs. These (or no other DVD-Rs that I've seen) contain the formatting necessary to have subtitles. If Universal reads this, English SDH subtitles are a must have! Yeah, I don't think Universal cares about the reviews either. If they did, they would release full sets. I should add that the case, which is consistent with DVD-Rs...crappy. The back of the case claims that the DVD has subtitles. Even a bigger disappointment from the transient flash of hope that they had put them on even though the product description didn't mention or list them. Even worse, the back cover of the case looks like they just ""copied"" the back of the case from an earlier season without really checking what information was correct and what wasn't, hence the mistake regarding having subtitles. The case is a standard type set plastic case with clear outer cover, a paper insert outside with graphics consistent with the other seasons of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Inside the case are flip leaves holding the discs. Not impressive, to say the least. Functional, however.

I also get the complaints about the quality of the DVD-Rs ""lasting"" and dying. I'm seeing that with new DVDs as well. The problem isn't the DVD-Rs, in my opinion, its quality of the pressings. I've gone through four copies of ""The Wedding Singer"" and they keep going bad. DVDs, R or Not are not as good as they were. Some studios like Warner and 20th Century Fox are turning out inexcusably bad quality DVDs. Universal a little bit. I'm sure somebody more informed than myself could explain why thats the case, but it seems to coincide with pressings in Mexico. Perhaps they're using poorer quality plastic to save money? Its a side point, I think.

Other details regarding the release:

The video quality: Varies, obviously. Some of the film stock is a little damaged, but the remastering job is decent. I'd say the video quality on my clanky old DVD players, not enhanced Blu-Ray, is about B to B+. Its not sweet, sweet remastering, but its not a half-burned film dropped in a vat of vinegar either. Universal didn't churn and burn this one. The video quality actually seems better than on some of the earlier seasons. I don't want to praise the purveyors of DVD-Rs, so I'll just say its not a disappointment.

Sound Quality: Its not bad. Its clear, doesn't distort too badly or have excessive static. There is a little static here and there and the normal ""hiss"" for the period. I will make a complaint the levels vary somewhat. The levels on the first disk, for instance, got progressively louder for the first five or six episodes and then tapered back off a little. I'd give the sound about a B+ as well. I can't help but remembering that the television show is from more than fifty years ago.

The season contains ""The Pearl Necklace"" which is easily one of the best of all the Alfred Hitchcock Presents Episodes of all time. ""Sybilla"", ""The Horse Player"", ""The Landlady"" and ""Incident at a Small Jail"" are all top flight episodes in this season. Other notable episodes are ""A Crime for Mothers"", ""Self-Defense"", ""The Gloating Place"" and ""Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat"". The quality of the material alone is worth buying the set, damned be the the DVD-Rs. If they had switched to DVD-Rs around Season Two, there wouldn't be a Season Six to review I would wager.

Update: Like so many people, my first set came with a defective disc 4. I returned it to Amazon, got a new set and now disc 5 is defective, but only because of my Sony DVD carousels on random. The disc selected on random doesn't produce sound. The original discs from the first set with the defective disc 4 didn't play at all on random. So, this is a vast improvement. Will attempt to actuate the return/exchange function on Amazon again and see if disc 5s are all defective.

For the record, I think I had to go through three sets of Season 1 (with their crummy double-sided discs) to get a full working copy.",1384300800,28,6513,4.6826923076923075
5981707,1,B00FEOYY8G,"It is a real comedown for this entertaining and long running dramatic anthology tv series.  Despite the fact that it is now being produced on DVD-R (at a higher asking retail price and exclusive to the U.S. only distribution) there are those who are stubbornly still going with it.  Although I respect their regard for the show I have no sympathy or appreciation for the very poor judgement on this.

I'm sure that the series previously did well enough as a general ""standard"" DVD release but some supporter's logic (or lack-of-it) in the ready acceptance of MOD really escapes me on this.  Outside of the quality of the subject matter itself to recommend it the video source elements are not even digitally remastered and fully restored.  Why make things even worse by going to the inferior MOD?!

8614925,5,B00FEOYY8G,This dvd I had a problem with. It was the only one that was not packaged as the other ones. But thats cosmetic. The contents of Hitchcock are what makes it matter.  The true genius of Alfred Hitchcock is to look at his madness and macabre. I only wish that the box dvd set wasn't sold out when I bought this.,1521504000,,308,4.049180327868853

Will contact customer service for an exchange. also season one with episodes that freeze and break up. I might add that VHS tapes don't break up and have better sound quality.",1520208000,,259,4.608695652173913
8614927,3,B00FEOYY8G,"I  liked the DVDs, but the tabs that hold them in the case are broken and the DVDs will not stay in the case.  They will end up getting scratched.  They should have a better quality control for this.",1514505600,,199,4.051282051282051
8614928,4,B00FEOYY8G,"Upon arrival, Just about all of the TABS that hold the DVD's in place were all broken off.  The broken off  tabs fell out in my lap when I opened the case.  DVD's in case were sliding inside case.  Only one DVD was still in place.  Fortunately...none of the disc were not badly scratched and seem to play ok. Will need to get brand new cases to put all of these DVD's in now for I do not feel like returning them. Better to replace the case.",1510012800,2,441,4.022988505747127

8614931,4,B00FEOYY8G,"No issues with the playability of the discs, including the problematic disc 4. All played fine. I agree with others about presentation though. No episode booklet and the on-screen menu is very basic. The flimsy case the discs are presented in is atrocious, poorly made and received broken with discs floating about inside. With the poor quality case 2 discs were scratched as they slid about inside. This issue should be resolved to protect the discs or sales will drop. People have a right to receive discs in good order after paying good money so please replace the case design. 4 stars only...I removed 1 for poor case design. I now own all 1-7 Seasons and am pleased with the majority of the collection. Alfred Hitchcock Presents Season 6 should have been treated as the previous seasons in a better presentation case with a booklet in my opinion..otherwise its a great collection all round and Hitchcock preserved for posterity.",1501891200,,933,4.8742138364779874

Modern day TV programs are so lousy compared to these classics. I would watch these anytime rather than the programs on TV these days.",1498953600,,260,4.8
