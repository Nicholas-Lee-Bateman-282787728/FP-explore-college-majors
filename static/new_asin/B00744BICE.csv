8509620,4,B00744BICE,"This is a 2009 film from Agnieszka Holland (`The Killing', `The Wire' and `Washington Square to name but a few) she is a Polish film and TV producer and seemed like the right choice for this subject and yes it is sub titled. Juraj or George Janosik was the Robin Hood of central eighteenth century Europe. Well he worked in the areas around Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, and did that robbing from the rich and sometimes giving to the poor. He is very well known in folklore as he is seen as a common man who stood up to the injustices of a Europe ravaged by the greed of the Habsburgs and the concomitant wars that it gave birth to. He was fighting at fifteen but got caught by the Habsburgs and was pressed into service for them, where he learnt all sorts that would help him in his later career.

After being bought out of servitude he decided that being a shepherd was not exactly the pinnacle of excitement, so when he was offered the chance to become a brigand and get to rob rich folk, he leapt at the chance. This film follows his tales and stories and sticks pretty much close to the accepted facts, but as there is so much folklore and myth, it really has to remain a moot point.

So is it any good, well I found it a bit drawn out, the action is sporadic and often done very well, but a lot of the 150 minute film is used to draw on the machinations and domesticity of the main players, so we have lots of bedroom grunting, followed by a bit of banditry, then some soul searching, and some more gentleman's excuse me then some robbery, drinking etc. We also get a dollop of witchcraft, some infanticide weird dream sequences and a smattering of popery. This was a co-production that was part financed by HBO Europe and as such I had high hope. I did watch in two sittings which means it could have broken the momentum, but I don't think so. There are some very good performances here and it was filmed on location so has a real feel of authenticity and attention to period detail but could still have been better. On the other hand I knew next to nothing about this character from history and the Robin Hood thing is a bit misleading as I did not see too much philanthropy, more of an opportunistic but likeable rogue hence the rating. He also doesn't wear tights or have a goatee so nothing like the aforementioned Hood. But for some well made if a tad pedestrian folklore/history from Poland about a Slovakian legend, then this might be spot on for you.",1343088000,3,2465,4.344902386117137
