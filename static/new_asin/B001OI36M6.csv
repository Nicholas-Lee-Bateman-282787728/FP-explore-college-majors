3730369,5,B001OI36M6,"This was a perfect choice for me to watch today, on what should have been my husband's 40th birthday.  I'm a relatively fresh widow, and I found the interviews with other widows further out than me helpful.  I also found it helpful to see how differently different people coped with their loss.  I recommend this DVD to young widows as well as the people around them who want to understand.",1235865600,,390,4.542857142857143
3730370,5,B001OI36M6,"This video is a must to give to family and friends of widows/widowers.  My mom watched this video and told me it made her realize that grief can still be there for me...even though it's been six years and I'm remarried.

Wonderfully put together and a terrific insight into both young widowhood and the general public's reaction to it.",1234137600,2,335,4.661016949152542
3730371,5,B001OI36M6,"61 Minutes of your life that you should share with a friend. Those who are widowed and those who aren't because someday- they might be! Saying the right thing, doing the right thing is different for each and every one person. This piece is a beautiful insight into the world of widowhood-male and female- gay and straight.

It should be mandatory for every psych and socio Freshman class in every university and college. Compassionate, caring, gut-wrenching and a real insight into a world that no one ever wants to join.

A great documentary!",1231718400,8,543,4.827956989247312
3730372,5,B001OI36M6,"I loved this film.  Our society seems to treat young widows as if they are invisible or do not exist.  I lost my husband, not my mind, and this film assured me that I'm not crazy, I'm grieving.",1231459200,4,193,4.052631578947368

3730374,5,B001OI36M6,"I found this movie deeply touching and moving.  As a widower, it touched me on a very personal level, yet I can't imagine anyone not being riveted.

The people being interviewed were quite obviously honestly sharing their innermost experiences.  Very powerful, and yet ultimately uplifting and life-affirming.

Heartily recommended - to all.",1231200000,4,341,5.5
3730375,5,B001OI36M6,"The documentary ""Young Widow, Naked in the Memorial Playground"" by first time filmmaker Elizabeth Titus is a different kind of look at widowhood in that it is not of a ""self help"" nature, but rather, a film about stereotypes.  In it she profiles several subjects, all of them ""young widows"" - happy, vibrant, loving wives/husbands, some are mothers or fathers to young children, business owners or adventurers, their common bond is they have all lost their spouses far too young - in their 20s/30s/40s.  The film follows their stories through three phases: ""loss"", ""grief"" and ""renewal"", and we learn that these young widows survive, learn to heal and eventually learn to rebuild a quality life from a life which had taken a catastrophic and, most often, unexpected turn directly in the middle of it.

In contrast to the interviewees profiles, the film examines and exposes, through brief interviews of ""people on the street"", society's unfortunate, yet all-too-common ideas and misconceptions about what a widow is, how long society thinks one ""should"" grieve and what someone outside looking in should/could do or say to help someone they love who has lost their spouse.  A lot of enlightenment for very little investment, this film would be of great interest to young widows/widowers at all stages of grief, but I would also recommend it to anyone who has a young widow/widower in their life whom they wish to understand and support.  This film would be especially useful to anyone who works as a professional in grief therapy/counseling (secular or theologic).",1230940800,7,1564,5.070038910505836
8330633,5,B001OI36M6,"Losing your partner to early death is the most profound and emotionally damaging loss that one can experience in life. Young widows find themselves navigating a confusing and LONELY world where getting through the next minute can seem overwhelming, let alone facing the unknown future alone.

If you've recently lost a partner or if you have a widowed friend/family member that you wish to support - buy this DVD! Elizabeth Titus has done an amazing job of illustrating both our cultural misconceptions of widowhood and the emotional (mostly unmet) needs of the young widow in our modern world.

This is the film that could only be created by someone who has been in the trenches. You will not get find this level of understanding from ANY therapist/friend/lover/parent who hasn't experienced young widowhood personally.

Buy this DVD, you might even find yourself smiling.",1358553600,,873,5.133802816901408

I would very highly recommend this documentary to professors of Social work courses, Sociology courses, and Psychology courses.

8330638,5,B001OI36M6,"The first time I watched this documentary, Young Widow, Naked in the Memorial Playground, I was on a plane with another young widowed friend on our way to meet up with other young widoweds.  I wondered what the young girl next to us thought about our laughing and crying to what we were watching.  The documentary is an honest look at how society sees widowhood, and the reality that meets you when you find yourself a young widow.  It breaks the stereotyped-misconception most people have of what a widow is, and brings you face to face with the reality that widowhood knows no age boundaries.
When you watch this, you will cry, you will laugh, you will be amazed at the people you meet.  And you will never think of the word ""widow"" the same again.",1257897600,,750,4.492647058823529

I think it is a wonderful film for people trying to understand the grieving process -- for anyone who is wondering what to say to those grieving and untimely death.
