8262776,5,B0016K76WI,"After the first 4 episodes, I wasn't sure where the series was going. It seemed to still be looking for a tone. After 8 episodes, I'm still wondering if its ever going to find a consistent tone, but I don't really care. Every episode is fabulously unpredictable. One will be a wacky comedy, and the next will be an over-the-top mahoshojou - alien battle, or a spy thriller. A touching moment turns into a madcap chase scene... out of the blue;

A lot of the choices seem really weird at the time... like having Renko go from verbally to physically abusive, and then using that episode as a showcase for the character's softer side. Yet somehow it works, and afterwards, you can't imagine it having happened any other way.

The Genshiken OVA is spectacular, as always. For fans of the series, its probably worth the price of admission all on its own. But don't neglect the Kuji-Un episodes either: any fan of anime will find something they like in there... even if it's just the Yamada fanservice.

The biggest disappointment about this series is that there's only one DVD worth of episodes left. For me, its been on pre-order for a month already.",1214352000,2,1146,4.635467980295567
