8758621,5,B01EGQR4N4,"I had seen Gong Hyo Jin's first high school teacher role in Sang-doo Let's Go To School (with Rain in his first real role) and really enjoyed that so I wasn't sure I would like Hello My Teacher with Gong Yoo (Goblin, Coffee Prince) as much, but lo and behold I ended up liking it MORE. The Two Gongs have fabulous chemistry here and there are so many wonderful romantic moments as their relationship builds that you'll be melting a lot. I also loved the second male lead but he was a bit of a wimp compared to Gong Yoo's character. This copy that occasionally sells on Amazon probably IS a bootleg, you can tell from the simple menus, but the print wasn't bad like the other reviewer claims, it was very watchable, subtitles were excellent, resolution good for a 12 year old K-drama. If you have a 40 inch TV it will look just fine, but might be a bit soft if you have a 60 inch TV set or bigger. Also I should mention how powerful the students' stories all were, I often found myself crying hot tears over their realistic dilemmas. Great acting all around, and a wonderful soundtrack (it's on iTunes). If you are a fan of either Gong actor then don't miss this show for the world! It's a shame the two main streaming sites don't carry this title.",1512864000,2,1247,4.333333333333333

8758623,1,B01EGQR4N4,"Copied from TV channel....  The picture quality is poor, fuzzy and glitches, top of the heads are cut off due to zoom recording to avoid the channel signature(which you can still see) I would never buy from this seller again.",1439683200,,225,4.625
