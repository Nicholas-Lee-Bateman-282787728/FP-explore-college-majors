4381724,5,B004I1K2GY,"The Dead Man's Gun series of hour shows tells how different people get a particular gun in the old west and use it. Each show has a moral showing that using a gun is wrong. ""The Highwayman"" is a good example. A husband and wife run a boarding house with about four or five boarders. The place is run down and the food meager because the proprietors are poor. They can't even pay their mortgage. Then a rich man and his wife come to stay for a short while because the local hotel is filled. He has the gun.

 One day the husband sees him lying drunk in an alley and robs him of his money and the gun. The rich man leaves town and the husband buy items for the boarding house and for his wife. He is certain that his wife doesn't know what he did. He likes the small luxury and decides to use the gun to hold up a stage coach. Then he does it again and is slightly wounded while fleeing the crime. He decides to abandon his criminal activities and throws away the gun. He lavishes gifts upon his wife and buys more items to improve the boarding house and turn it into a hotel.

 Does his wife know what he did? Will she be happy with their changed circumstances? Will she feel that she cannot stay with him? Will she want to take the money and start a life on her own?",1300320000,5,1266,4.072289156626506

4381743,4,B004I1K2GY,"Last year, during a free week-end of Encore Western, we watched a few episodes of Dead Man's Gun. We had never seen it before and found it quite entertaining.  If you are a western movie lover, you may enjoy this series. Most all of the episodes are well written, directed and photographed.  The only thing we thought gratuitous was the nudity in almost every episode of the first season. The second season dropped that issue and also began filming better stories.  Two episodes star Henry Winkler in the second season and show, without a doubt, that he is much more than the ""Fonz"" from Happy Days as far as acting is concerned.  He shows, in these episodes, that he has a lot more depth of portrayal than one would think and yet never has to sink into the evil, bad guy mode in order to make us believe his character is real.  There are other famous guest stars as we'll.  The great Rocky Horror Picture Show star, Meatloaf also shows up in an episode and surprises us delightfully with his portrayal of a rather complicated man. There are many others and for the modern western lover, this series will be fun.  It is shot more like a movie than a TV show and is worth your time and worth the price.",1391212800,,1201,4.407239819004525
4381744,5,B004I1K2GY,I love westerns and this is a quality product for western film fans  Highly recommended for western film fans for sure.,1388793600,,119,4.666666666666667
4381745,4,B004I1K2GY,"It's true that it's not the best western I've ever seen, but I found many of the episodes intriguing. I am impressed with how hard they tried to keep each episode interesting. Believe me, not every western puts forth that kind of effort.",1383177600,,237,4.534883720930233
4381746,5,B004I1K2GY,"Love the show. Easy breezy and Henry Winkler iced the cake.
I'd never heard of it, not usual for me to watch t.v. shows til they come out on DVD. Tho this one certainly isn't new.
This is one of those series l could watch with someone familiar with a lot of celebrities, mostly those that play small roles but frequently.
Happy it's in my collection!",1382486400,,350,4.318181818181818
4381747,5,B004I1K2GY,"I purchased Deadman's Gun DVDs via the Internet (from what I later found out was an on-line scam artist from China).  The quality was terrible and 85% pixelized.  Luckily, I was able to get a credit to my credit card account.  I recorded the entire 44 shows from the Starz/Encore Western Channel presentations and transferred them to DVD (quite a task).  Now . .  on to this (legal) edition.  When I saw these disks became available, I ordered them immediately, and am very pleased with it.  I shall keep my semi-legal copies, but will enjoy this, as well as the First Season's disks.  The show is excellent (somewhat slow at times, but overall excellent acting and production).  5 Stars!",1377648000,,688,4.714285714285714
4381748,5,B004I1K2GY,We love westerns and missed this series because we do not get that TV station. It's very entertaining if you love western movies.,1373241600,2,129,4.6521739130434785
4381749,5,B004I1K2GY,"Dead Mans Gun was airing around the time Lexx I believe. Lexx was crazy and insane stuff but fun, this show is likewise. I searching the internet for reasons why it was cancelled or interviews with it's producer, none of which I could find. Unfortunately for us there is always going to be a mystery of how good it's ratings were, why was it cancelled, and who decided that season 3 would never happen. I am not angry but disappointing because if they'd done 2 more seasons this would've just been outstanding IMO.

If anyone ever finds out the answers to these questions, etc. post here. Thanks!",1364688000,,596,4.570093457943925

8429919,4,B004I1K2GY,"Not a bad series, but has a drawback. The things I liked about the series is that it's a Western. (Same town prop, but you have to overlook that.) The series brings moral lessons to the forefront on how one should live their life. It has a pretty nice set, good costume work, a good feel to the entire series. If you enjoy Westerns you'll probably enjoy the series, it has a lot to offer the fan of the genre. Each of the shows has unique characters and actors in them, a bit amazing that there are so many unknown actors available for each of the episodes - you'll see some famous faces too as well.

The thing I didn't appreciate about the series is basically the same moral lesson is taught over and over again. This makes the series like a set of short stories - that are only linked through the fact that the same gun appears in each story. The lesson being learned is basically the same, self righteousness, arrogance, greed; these will bring one's downfall.

The challenge for the writers was to create various scenarios, and characters, who are coming at the lesson from a different angle - one that could have hypothetically existed in the West. I'm glad I purchased, watched (then passed along) the series (consisted of Seasons 1 and 2), but I could see why it would be hard to make this a long running series. The story line tough to carry - the last episode basically a wash, filler only to provide closure.",1514764800,,1419,4.432950191570881
