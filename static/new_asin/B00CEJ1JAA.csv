5718921,3,B00CEJ1JAA,"This is a great story of someone who really cared about a stranger and saw it through to the end. Though this woman is nothing like me in many ways, her passion and devotion to a man who was literally lost in the prison system is laudable. This is a great testimony to what one person can do if they just keep trying.",1437609600,2,317,4.0476190476190474

5718923,5,B00CEJ1JAA,"Having worked with the TX DOC as a contract employee inside a Prison based Program all I can say is: the intransigence and immovable object that all Prison Admins represent are solely punitive and not designed to rehabilitate inmates, no matter what those incarcerated are called.  The smells, feelings of frustration and hostility generated behind the fences and guard towers have to be experienced to know them!  The levels of anxiety and fear are beyond anything the suit's world can imagine.  Being a part of it for several years made me appreciate my freedom much more than I can put into words.  I actually began to tear up when watching the artist's reaction to the memory of Herman's ""phone sermons""!  Fighting lost causes most of my life has made me look at reality with a different philosophy based on a different perception of reality than the average ""white-man""  Nobody Knows the Trouble I've seen"" is part of a Negro Spiritual"" sung by Paul Robson a long time ago, and it fits this whole scheme of things in LA and indeed in all the Penal Institutions in Amerika!",1436918400,5,1077,4.732620320855615

5718927,4,B00CEJ1JAA,"A documentary I found fascinating but ultimately a little frustrating.  The basic story is powerful.  Herman Wallace spent close to 40 years in solitary confinement in a U.S. for a murder he possibly did not commit.  There are (oddly unexplored) hints that his sentence may have had political motivations. Wallace is befriended by artist Jackie Sumell, who decides to help free Wallaces mind, if she cant free him physically from bondage.  So she asks him to imagine what kind of house hed want if he were set free, and sets out to create it, first as a model for a gallery installation, and later to try and actually build the house full scale, as a place for at-risk youths.  So, with such a great story I was prepared (perhaps over-prepared) to be pulled in and emotionally effected.

And as an outcry against the cruelty of solitary confinement in a 6 by 9 foot cell, 23 hours a day year after year it is indeed effecting.  But the films focus is less on Wallace and the U.S. prison system then it is about Sumells journey as an artist.  And while she is an interesting woman, her story just cant compete with the compelling nature of Wallaces.

Theres also something vaguely off-base feeling about Sumell, that feels unexplored.  The whys and wherefores of her obsession with Wallace and her quixotic quest to create his house are presented, but not very deeply investigated.  There are moments when she comes off as a deeply committed figure, at others there are hints she may be  in a way  exploiting Wallace for her own career, and at others that her efforts are misguided  - that the same effort could be spent helping to free this man, instead of on an art project.  But these potentially rich issues are never mined.

The film is certainly worth seeing, and it raises important questions. But where the film puts its focus, and how deep it goes left me wishing for something more  at least on first viewing.",1398211200,34,1918,4.627218934911243
5718928,5,B00CEJ1JAA,"I found it simply AMAZING  Herman could survive 4 this long a period of time (40 yrs +), in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, and still maintain his health  & faculties.  It's unbelievable, and its strictly UNUSTIFIABLE.  Also,  for a situation such as this, in Louisiana or any other state, t/b allowed to continue goes far beyond the realm of CRUEL & UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT.  For this situation to continue to prevail w/o any CORRECTIVE ACTION/INVESTIGATIVE having been, or being taken by any respective agency/element of our government I find difficult to understand.

5718936,4,B00CEJ1JAA,"It was an interesting premise that got hijacked and turned into a movie about the artist herself.

Yes they say he violated this rule but they never tell what he did that they say is a  I agree that 36 years is ridiculous and I admire their ability to stay sane. Our politics not the same but he is a compelling person.
Unfortunately it's almost all about her and he gets lost .

Got to say one thing, don't follow his advice regarding a dog. Do not follow it. There are many wonderful great dogs who do have a past, because of that past and time stressed out in a shelter, they have been the best dogs (&and cats). I've had puppies and tried adoption of a dog from the neighbor who was moving awful mistake. Shelters work with dogs to ensure they are not aggressive against adults, children, strangers etc and they tell you so you'll know. My favorite breed is rescued. We have not had anything but rescued since 1993 and have had tremendous experiences in several states. The adults we rescued are amazingly grateful, you can see it in their faces when they realize that they have a new lease on life, they have a loving family now. Because of this we never had problems. And I'm talking about our dog who ran away, made one block and stopped. She looked away, looked at me and came home on her own and never did it again. She died in 07 and the dog we have is wonderful off leash. So I am just saying that you do not have to get a puppy.

5718952,1,B00CEJ1JAA,Not exactly sure what the point of this short term documentary was.....to expose the use of solitary confinement (Herman did 41 years and seemed pretty much together).....the early plight of the black panthers and their cause in prison.....or the fact that every human being has the ability to effect at least 1 other fellow human in life. It appeared that Herman had a dream and a purpose for this house and the young lady that was seeing it through pretty much disregarded everything he said and made a movie about it.,1461715200,,520,4.725274725274725

I'm hawkish when it comes to capital punishment in certain cases but this documentary convinces me solitary confinement is worse than death. You will love the gal who orchestrates building a ""house"" that duplicates the actual size of Herman's cell. And she has sought to secure a change in status for him. All efforts have not lasted because, we have to be honest, this man, kind as he appears, can't seem to function in a regular ward. Lots of probing questions about our crumbling justice system.
