2269450,5,B00097FLFS,"These 5 guys are so talented, so funny and so right on the money with respect to each of their specialties, it is mindboggling. I keeep trying to pick a favorite, but I change from one to the other; still, if I did have to pick one, it would have to be Carson because he really makes me laugh. Each one of their straight guy do-overs is unique and has it's own special charm, some more so than others, due to the straight guys themselves; one I really disliked but he was more cordial toward the end when he finally showed a glimmer of gratitude. (The motorcycle guy) Some of the more memorable ones are, the brothers who wrestled constantly and had some rather gross hygiene bad habits which were resolved (and still are, hopefully), the guy who was going overseas to Iraq and leaving his wife and baby, the TX college fraternity and the 2 professional skaters who were breathtaking in their beauty and their skating ability, and their own personal grace. Thom, is a riot but also very caring and moved when someone is truly a survivor, like the guy who had 2 lung transplants...Jai is great with fine tuning the relationships and addresing the more subtle and important aspects to personalizing the couples; Kyan is the grooming guy and a great looking guy as well; he has very useful advice on hair, skin, etc and is a pleasure to watch; Ted is the ultimate gourmand and knows good food, how to prepare it, how to create dishes which are appetizing and attractive, and always original, and he does it with flair; but again, Carson is...well, amazing. He is funny, has great fashion sense and a keen eye; he can walk into any store and find exactly the right clothes for each one of the do-over guys. His wit is lightning fast and he is NEVER at a loss for a superb riposte. EVERY guy is far better off for having spent time with the Fab 5, and 99 percent are accordingly grateful...

The Fab 5 are exactly that; and each one is kind, caring and wonderfully inventive and funny, all combine to create a totally new and innovative show, which should also do much to alleviate homophobia; if you were a homophobe before you saw this show, you certainly won't be after you've seen them in action; they are the premiere ambassadors to the ""straight"" world...kudos, Fab 5...and thank you for so much enjoyment and fun, and moving, memorable experiences.",1122422400,11,2350,4.555555555555555

2269496,4,B00097FLFS,Love Carson the most. He is fall out of my chair funny. I love how they covet all the bases and give great insight and suggestions.,1389052800,,131,4.076923076923077
2269497,4,B00097FLFS,"I never saw Queer Eye for the Straight Guy during its initial run on television, and only in the last year or so did I finally get caught up with it via streaming services. Nevertheless I instantly fell in love with the Fab Five, and was dismayed to find that none of the seasons were ever released for purchase on DVD proper. I happened to come across this box set, which is basically a collection of hour-long clip shows and compilations of the guys' best, funniest, and most memorable moments, and it's not half bad, assuming you know what you're getting into ahead of time. Here's a rundown of what exactly is included here:

- ""The Best of Carson's Style."" Includes second disc of Carson-related outtakes (which in my opinion may be worth the price of this entire set alone, lol) and one full-length episode of Queer Eye as a bonus feature. It's the one titled, ""He's a Little Bit Country, She's a Little bit Overwhelmed,"" with that really cute urban cowboy guy who's planning to propose to his girlfriend.

- ""The Best of Thom's Home."" Includes a second disc of Thom outtakes as well as the very first episode of Queer Eye ever aired as a bonus feature. Thom initially took a while to grow on me, but he can be pretty darn witty when he wants to.

- ""The Best of Ted's Food and Wine."" Includes a bonus audio CD of ""Lounge Essentials"" which contains an intriguing selection of breezy tracks with relaxing jazz and island elements. Cocktails, anyone?

- ""The Best of Kyan and Jai's Looking Good."" Includes another audio CD called ""Deep Collective"" which, even as someone who typically loves dance/club music, I found to be a bit uninspiring and probably best suited for background noise.

So all in all that is 8 discs' worth of material, which is still no substitute for actual full-length episodes, but as I said above, is better than nothing at all. I should mention that all the clips are taken from the first 20 or so episodes when the show was still fairly young, so you'll see the same ""straight guys"" appear over and over again throughout the set, but that's not a huge deal. If you find this for a cheap price - I didn't even break double digits ordering my copy, so look around  - it's worth getting for a laugh or two, and believe it or not, the tips they offer can actually be pretty useful in daily life. Still, here's hoping for a more comprehensive release in the future.",1379980800,7,2390,4.5080831408775985
2269498,3,B00097FLFS,"I have to say that this show is great. I actually never watched it when it was on television, but my wife was a fan. I purchased this as a gift for her. We watched them together. There are two episodes as other have stated. It is difficult to find one of the two on the menus.

The rest of the discs are either not DVDs or are just crazy cracked out clips that only a die hard fan could enjoy. I was constantly wondering what was the setup to the 10-20 second clip, or wishing to see more... just as it flipped to another one. It is actually very tiring to try and watch. Almost like Blair Witch meets Bravo. A decent show, but so shaken and tossed at you that it's hard to know where to look.

Like I said, a die hard fan will be ""hey I remember that"" over and over. Anyone else will be lost.

Now... it is not the shows fault. It is Bravo's. Bravo should really release these full seasons on DVD and they could finally make up for this mistake.",1320451200,2,946,4.0212765957446805
2269499,3,B00097FLFS,"I used to watch this show and these dvd's show clips of the best of each guy on the show.  I would have prefered the entire espisode of the favorites selected and not just the clips.  I did get this collection for a great price, so that was very nice and they were delivered quickly.",1280534400,,283,4.127272727272727
2269500,1,B00097FLFS,"This group of DVDs is mostly a collection of themed montages.  A clip here, a bite there all around a single individual.  You jump quickly from spot to spot.  To me, it was like watching hours and hours of an introduction.  That said, I live overseas and have limited access to American TV so it was better than nothing.  Glad I borrowed it and didn't buy it.",1173484800,11,359,4.298507462686567
2269501,5,B00097FLFS,"The Fabulous 5 boxed set only leaves me panting for more!  Target audience men in my life are enjoying what they learn, as are the other fabulous men in my life!  I'm ready for more, Boys!",1167955200,,188,4.194444444444445
2269502,1,B00097FLFS,"This was a REAL disappointment.  The initial Amazon review gave the impression that I was buying the show since I live overseas and only see recordings from time to time.  I was looking forward to seeing all the shows back to back.  These DVDs were clips and outtakes from the shows and if I had opened this before leaving the US I would have returned it. For me, it was a big waste of money and the producers of the show should know it.  I'll avoid any offering that comes out in the future based on what they turned out this time.",1137283200,46,532,4.186274509803922
2269503,3,B00097FLFS,"As someone who has not seen many episodes of Queer Eye, I was a little disappointed.  The 8 DVDs contain only 2 full episodes, and the rest is out-takes, snippets, and 2 music CDs.  While it's always fun to watch the guys, when it was out of context of an entire show it wasn't as enjoyable for me.  I like to know the back-story on the straight guy.  Worth purchasing since there's nothing else out there right now, but it could be better.",1128470400,34,440,4.265060240963855
2269504,5,B00097FLFS,I just bought this yesterday and I was not disappointed.  Kyan is my favorite but I love the sense of humor and candor of each of these guys.  They are all funny and endearing and seem like they are having the time of their lives.  Their enthusiasm for what they do is infectious.....,1126137600,,284,4.320754716981132
2269505,5,B00097FLFS,"I've been a QE fan since the beginning...impatiently waiting for these DVD's. I wasn't disappointed! Just as with the show itself, I giggled, laughed, snorted, guffawed.....and learned some valuable lessons along the way. The Fab 5 are amazing! Snaps to Thom, Ted, Kyan, Carson and Jai. This set of DVD's is an excellent collection of episodes and snippets from season 1. The out-takes alone are worth the price. Now I'm going to be impatiently waiting for the DVD collections from seasons 2 and 3....thank Ghod, now I have something to keep me entertained while I wait!",1122940800,2,570,4.947916666666667

8058073,1,B00097FLFS,Pass this up. Not what I thought is was. The price was good and yes too good to be true.,1461715200,,88,3.45
8058074,2,B00097FLFS,"The one full episode on one of the DVD's is great.  The rest of the collection is fast-paced cuts from one quick clip to another, with music blaring the entire time.  It gives me a headache trying to watch it.  What is the holdup on getting a collection of full episodes?  If it's royalties, then Bravo needs to pay these guys what they are worth and get this show onto the market, just like all the other shows one can already buy on DVD.",1450483200,,439,4.190476190476191

8058079,3,B00097FLFS,"Each CD has snippets from an episode, but none has the entire episode. A bit disappointing, but worth the price I paid for it.",1413936000,,126,4.291666666666667
8058080,5,B00097FLFS,"Yes, like other reviewers stated, season box sets of Queer Eye would have been great.  However, if this is what we get, I'll take it.  Thom's and Carson's dvd's were my favorites - not the least of which was because each contains a full episode.  The two episodes they picked were great choices and the pieces of the other episodes sprinkled throughout appeared to be from mostly four other episodes so you still get a beginning to end experience by watching each designer's own dvd.  I watched all of the dvd's and loved each one. I just might watch them again this weekend.

The collection contains all of the verve, style and 5 sets of discerning queer eyes.  I watched this show religiously when it aired and recently found it back on Esquire channel - albeit at the crack of dawn.  I'll take the Fab 5 with my morning coffee over the dreary news any day.

The rest of the 6 designer dvd's provide outtakes, loads of quips, lots of magic performed on needy straight guys as well as  ""quality time"" with the 5 guys this straight woman would be happy to be stranded with on a desert island.

Had I bought this set assuming it was lots of complete episodes, like many of the reviewers, I would have been let down too.  But, since I knew what I was getting, I LOVED this set.  It is a great representation of the personalities, the talent, the style and the heart of the Fab 5!",1395532800,,1377,4.377952755905512
8058081,5,B00097FLFS,I love these guys and the shows are awesome.  Not sure about the cds included???  Would buy more if entire episodes were available.,1392336000,,131,4.6521739130434785
