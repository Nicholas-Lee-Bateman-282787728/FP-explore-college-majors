2423288,4,B000BKVL66,"I was more than delighted when I was finally able to watch the biography of Paul Newman.  I have been a fan for only a few months but I have seen a great number of his films and was becoming curious about his life as well.  This documentary does a wonderful job of tying together his personal life  and the different stages of his career.  The biography explores not only  Newman's acting career, but also his experiences in car racing and in  philanthropy.  I have already seen it twice and will watch it again very  soon.  I only wish it had been longer!",941500800,,556,4.320388349514563
