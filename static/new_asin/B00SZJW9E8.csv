8699934,3,B00SZJW9E8,"It sounds a bit unbelievable, but it is true. `Looking for Mister Perfect' is a romantic-action-comedy directed by Ringo Lam, who is better known for his gritty action films like `Prison on Fire' and `Full Contact' with Chow Yun Fat (or some of Van Damme films like `Maximum Risk' ... if you like) Thanks to some nice action sequences and lovely Shu Qi, the film is marginally recommendable for the fans of Hong Kong films or the star.

Shot in and around a seaside hotel of Malaysia, `Mister Perfect' is about a Hong Kong policewoman Grace (Shu Qi) who accompanies her friend/model Joey to the sunny seaside hotel in Malaysia, where they are mistaken for, among others, criminals dealing with military information by a secret agent (Andy On, `Black Mask 2'). In the meanwhile, real criminal, gigolo-like Poon (Simon Yam, `Tomb Raider 2') appears with his high-kicking girlfriend there, only to make the whole situation more confusing.

As you see, the story of `Looking for Mister Perfect' is almost non-existent, never taking itself seriously. It is just an excuse for doing some amusing actions with Yam's finger-snapping, tap-dancing martial arts or well-choreographed slapstick jet-skiing actions on the beautiful sea of Malaysia. In addition to a romance, there are a bumbling superior officer, a petty thief, etc., all of them slightly entertaining, but none of them truly original.

Lightweight comedy with a few bits of actions, `Looking for Mister Perfect' may not be a prefect choice for the fans of Shu Qi, who looks quite uncomfortable in this awkwardly written script that does not know how to use her. Though she still looks beautiful here, it is Simon Yam's eccentric dancing killer who manages to interest you. The film is just a harmless comedy that you don't hate, but will forget instantly. And I'm still waiting for Ringo Lam's comeback.",1152835200,2,1858,5.006472491909385
