2257480,4,B000852G4U,"I enjoyed the special, especially the outtakes and home movies plus the photos.  I think this was long overdue.  However, I believe some private conversations between husband and wife should be kept to themselves.  There are too many people looking for negative things to say about Elvis already.",1116374400,2,296,5.125
2257481,5,B000852G4U,"Finally!! It's about time that the world can see what I've seen for many, many years.  Elvis Aaron Presley is and always will be the ""King Of Rock & Roll"".  Nobody can deny it.  This DVD shows the true Elvis Presley.  There was so much more to the person than the image.  More than just ""Blue Suede Shoes"" and ""Hound Dog"".  His music goes so much farther than that. He truly was a great entertainer, but more than that, he was a great person.  One must look beyond his personal faults.  After all, we all have them.  Elvis was a very religious man.  He loved his country and more than anything, he loved his family.  It hurts us true fans to see him ""put down"" by people who don't even know the real Elvis or how powerful and creative his music was.  He touched us all.  Thank you Priscilla and Lisa Marie for, hopefully, showing the world what a great entertainer he was and that he was an even greater human being.  This DVD is one that no Elvis fan should be without.  Long live the King.  THE ENTERTAINER OF THE CENTURY!!!!",1116374400,4,1027,4.270833333333333
2257482,5,B000852G4U,"I have never been a fan of Elvis.  Not that I didn't like him, I was just neutral and didn't grow up with his music.  I happened to be home the night this special aired on tv...there was not much else on, so I tuned in.  WOW.  I was very impressed with him as a person - particularly the spiritual side and his devotion to family and friends:  the gifts for people who were with him from the get-go,  his knowledge of all gospel music...and then, the performances!!!  I have always been a fan of rock music, and John Lennon in particular.  He revered Elvis and now I see why.  Even the ""fat Elvis"" segments, which I thought might be eliminated by the family, showed a powerful musician, with a great big SOUL.  I thought that Priscilla Presley was the perfect narrator...she knew him over many of the years, with a close relationship continuing after their marriage dissolved.  After I saw this documentary, I was anxious to rave about it to all my friends, be they Elvis fans or not...It was a perfect portrait of an artist, who may have or may not have known he had a gift for the world.",1116201600,38,1089,4.341584158415841
2257483,5,B000852G4U,"I've read alot of books on Elvis' life and seen quite a few of documentaries on him and I have to say that ""Elvis By The Presleys"" ranks as one of the best I've seen. I never really took a liking to Priscilla and us Elvis fans know what went on with her, but, I have to give her the thumbs up on what she, as well as family & friends, did from the heart.

 I would of liked to see & hear more from Lisa Marie in the documentary but I'm sure for her own reasons she kept it few and simple. As it is, you can tell it was very hard for her to talk about ""that day"".

And I LOVED IT when every, I mean every time they showed Elvis, HE LOOKED DAMN GOOD!!!! The was never one shot of him that was unflattering. Made me fall in love with him all over again!!!

 I highly recommended ""Elvis By The Presley"". It will certainly touch you.

LONG LIVE THE LEGACY!!!",1116201600,9,853,3.901734104046243
2257484,5,B000852G4U,"Too often what has been eclipsed by the image of Elvis Presley parodies and the spectacle of his over-the-top jump suits and the stories of excesses, was Elvis the showman and Elvis the person. This show provided irrefutable evidence of both. Even in his later days, when he was clearly no longer in his physical prime, Elvis could put over a song like few others. And the home movies fleshed out (no pun intended) the man behind the sequins. This special is no less of a 'comeback' than the 1968 television show. It restored Elvis' rightful place in the pantheon of popular music - and as a human being.

One cannot question, and can only thank Priscilla and Lisa Marie for allowing us to see their personal photos and films, as well as for those amazing performances again.

Rest in peace, King of Rock and Roll",1116201600,21,813,4.561643835616438
2257485,5,B000852G4U,"Don`t be bitter.  Lisa was a child when Elvis crossed over, who else but her mother, Priscilla, to take over the estate?  She saved Graceland & a lot of Elvis` popularity & legacy is being carried on because of the excellent decisions she made. She`s not perfect, Elvis wasn`t perfect...In her place, I don`t know what I would have done.  Nobody does.  Let the past go, so Elvis can live.  He loved Priscilla until his last breath on this earth, so give her a little breathing room.  I thought it was the best Elvis Special ever.  No bad pictures, outtake footage never seen before, he looked fantastic.  Home movies were great.  It showed a happy relaxed Elvis with his family.  They touched on everything, including his search to find himself, why the Colonel had such a hold on him, why he was forced to do the bad movies, after such a great start with Loving you, Jailhouse Rock, King Creole & Wild in the Country.  It showed his decline with dignity, his daughters reaction brought tears to my eyes.  Enjoy it for the great documentary it is & don`t judge.  Elvis lives & always will.....that`s all we have to know & cherish the fact that we still have him in all his glory to cherish, hopefully for as long as we walk this imperfect world.",1116201600,13,1245,4.48
2257486,1,B000852G4U,"It was Okay, I think it should have had more Lisa and

less Priscilla. Elvis and Priscilla were divorced and she

does have a boyfriend and son, which she never mentions. I

think she don't want to give up the Presley name. It seemed

instead of talking about Elvis, Priscilla was defending

herself from all the stories that have been told about her.

She said she divorced Elvis because you can't serve two

masters, and it was for the baby. Yeah right, she was living

with Mike Stone in an apartment. She forgets, People remember!

  When they sat down at the table, Priscilla was in Elvis'

chair. I think they should have left it empty, and at the

end Lisa should have said the last song was the one Elvis

finished his concerts with and went to the empty chair.

  Lisa should have been hosting the show, not her mother.",1116115200,8,828,4.413333333333333
2257487,2,B000852G4U,"Actually, a review of the tv special. Much of what was discussed was old news-easily available in Guralnick's fine bio CARELESS LOVE and Jerry Hopkin's ELVIS:THE FINAL YEARS. While it was interesting to hear some of it from Lisa and Priscilla, it still presents it from one point of view. According to most involved, Elvis's wife was seeing Mike Stone for quite some time before she left Elvis, aided by several of Elvis' freinds and their wives- a detail she conveniently left out for understandable reasons. It would be interesting to see what is included on the dvd but left out of the tv show-although I suspect the best they had to offer was already aired.",1116028800,10,661,4.706896551724138
2257488,5,B000852G4U,"First thought: What a stunning contrast to that tacky made-for-TV movie.

Second thought: Wow, I sure hope they'll make this one available on DVD.

Third thought: Gotta buy this!

I was especially moved by the outtakes, shown in this production, that had been dropped from the original specials. Priscilla's warm, intelligent, and engaging, as usual; both she and Lisa Marie are forthright about the darker side of life with Elvis without stooping to talk-show sensationalism.

We've waited a long, long time for a documentary like this.",1116028800,79,537,5.209302325581396

The video has some clips and pictures that have been seen before, And some that hasn't What I love about this video is some little details I didn't know. The best part I loved was on Disk 1 They talk about his break up with Priscilla, And then they lead up to his death. They interview Lisa Marie  about her fathers death. You can tell, It was hard for her to talk about that issue.
If you wan't material on Elvis then this is it. Im just tickled to have ordered this video.",1451606400,,524,3.9904761904761905

Do not ever buy anything from this seller!! Amazon has let me down as well... I have used amazon for a long time, but their service has gone to hell... They need to get a new CEO to follow up and care about what the company is doing! You will not see me buying anything from amazon for a very long time! Or ever!! You would think if there has been a regular customer for as many years that I have and spent as much money that I have, you would be taken care of. But no.. So I will just stick to e bay",1391644800,,675,3.6875
2257505,5,B000852G4U,"I don't know that this could have been done better it was perfect. I liked that unlike the movie Elvis and Me they were able to let us see the true Elvis without cutting up the man himself. That movie was horrible, it painted Elvis in a terrible light. Here you can see that although Elvis had faults just like the rest of us. He was more than anything a very loving, caring and giving man.

His talent, that adorable little boy charm, his hot sensual good looks those are something you can't buy. In watching this it makes it so easy to see why Elvis, although he didn't like it; is labeled King. He was smoking HOT! His talent will never be duplicated.

Personally I was glad it didn't show to much of Elvis last days. For me I want to remember Elvis laughing seeing that twinkle in his eyes. His happiness was contagious that's what I want to remember.

One thing though that I wish they would had said more about. They at EPE all Elvis friends, Priscilla and Lisa of course her parents. They have all mentioned how after the divorce Elvis would drop by Priscilla's at anytime any hour and just talk to her for hours. It would be interesting to know what they spent so much time talking about. Man to be a fly on that wall. LOL. Oh well I guess Priscilla deserves to keep some treasures to herself. They are so beautiful together.

Also in case someone at EPE is reading my review. Thanks to the genius who thought to put Elvis music in Lilo and Stich I have four kids who are all grown up and love Elvis. Thank You that was BRILLIANT!",1390608000,4,1538,4.274914089347079

2257514,5,B000852G4U,"I was pleasantly pleased with this.  There is alot of talking by Priscilla- there is alot of talking period.  Its nice to get to know more about the man.  No glossing over his flaws, prescription drug use, etc...the good and bad is all here.  What I was surprised was that they totally skipped over the King's Funeral.  It was a heartbreaking day on that hot Aug. day in 1977 for the world. They didn't even include any news clips which I found - odd.  Other than that- I enjoyed listening to LMP, Priscilla and Jerry talk about the man named Elvis.  Yes I would recommend this for any fan if you don't mind the funeral procession missing.",1369440000,3,639,4.410256410256411

Especially if you know anything about what his 'Southern' raising would have been like during the time he would have grown up.  It is told with love and caring by the people who knew him best.

She was allowed to take me with her to the movie theater and she kind of rubbed her love for Elvis on to me. I finally got to visit Graceland to experience parts of his life. The DVD, ""Elvis by the Presley's"" brings me full circle into his personal life where we meet all his friends and learn from his wife and daughter more about the private moments that defined Elvis' life and his stroll through music history. The DVD is a must buy for those of you that lived the years with him and those of you who are much younger and are now discovering the importance of his music. At Graceland, I took over one hundred photos and enjoy watching the DVD while I keep up with the story on the screen as well as my own personal look into his life.

2257534,4,B000852G4U,"I have seen and read everything I can find about Elvis.  I like this film by the Presley's.  We have not seen nor heard from Priscilla's family before nor have we heard Priscilla speak about Elvis in this way.  Priscilla's parents and sister and Lisa Marie join her and I was surprised how they felt about Elvis.  They loved Elvis and thought he was a great son in law and I would have thought they would be the ones saying ""I told you so"".  Priscilla explains what it was really like to be married to Elvis and why she could not be herself as long as she was with him.  She joined Elvis' life and had to conform to his ways.  It was all about Elvis and that was to never change.  Priscilla is much more mature and tells things in a different light today and will always defend his honor.  Priscilla like everyone else will always have respect for Elvis as an artist.  He wasn't the best husband but he was always good to Priscilla and they had a better relationship after their divorce than anytime that she was with him.  The pressure was being Mrs. Elvis Presley was off.  They found they liked each other any way.  They were close until the day he died.",1145404800,6,1157,4.276497695852535
2257535,3,B000852G4U,"It's a mystery, but somehow they have rendered Elvis and his story duller than you could imagine!  This is largely a yawnfest of unending Priscilla propaganda.  Less interviews and more music would've been this concept's saving grace; alas they missed out on that, the one thing that made Elvis--his MUSIC!!  I understand this was to be a personal history by those related to him, but they had Schilling in?  Why not some fellow musicians?  Guys like Burton or Tutt or contemporaries like Tom Jones?  Why not different Memphis Mafia members like Esposito or the Wests?  Gee, let's guess, especially as to the latter.  Despite the fact that Elvis needs no help in maintaining his mythic status, Priscilla guards it jealously and refuses to let other opinions be heard.  Too bad.  It get three stars BECAUSE IT IS THE KING AFTER ALL...but it could've gotten five if it had one more hour of music replacing an hour of talk, and if other voices were allowed to be heard by Empress Priscilla.",1135555200,11,987,4.752941176470588
2257536,5,B000852G4U,"I was skeptical at first.  Is this just another rehash of old Elvis stuff we've seen before?  Absolutely not!  I bought my first Elvis record in 1956, I Want You, I Need You, I Love You.  I was 11 years old. So, as you can figure out. I was a prime time Elvis fan.  Between 1956 and 1963 he was ""The King"" of the pop charts.  I've been through all of his books, albums, movies and postage stamp.  I picked up this CD and took a chance figuring that in over 4 hours of stuff, there must be something new.  What a pleasant surprise.  The movie gives us a much more personal look at Elvis.  Especially fascinating are the home movies.  You'll find out what Elvis liked to eat at Graceland interviewing his cook, that he was a Cleveland Browns football fan, that he had his fears and doubts. Plus lots of stage performances though the years, stories of the Colonel etc, his generosity, his lavishness, his meeting with Nixon etc..  It really is just too much to fit in a column.  Do yourself a favor.  If you're an old Elvis fan like me, you won't be disappointed.  There are new things you'll discover on this memerizing CD that you didn't know about Elvis.

2257537,4,B000852G4U,"I've been an Elvis fan for my entire life, I still listen to his CDs, and I can't even tell you how many books I've read about him over the years (from the reviled Albert Goldman hit-piece to Peter Guralnick's outstanding work), so I wasn't in a hurry to see ELVIS BY THE PRESLEYS because everything about it looked a fluff piece.

But this is NOT a fluff piece of Presley propaganda.

Everyone is surprisingly open and honest about a lot of their lives with Elvis, and the portrait that emerges from an already-researched-to-death life of the king of rock-n-roll manages to be fresh and fascinating to even the most jaded fan.  The home movies and photos are extensive, the memories shared by everyone (especially Priscilla, Lisa Marie and Jerry Schilling) are open and unflinching, the details of a life so hidden from the public during Elvis' reign are interesting and enlightening.

Be sure to check out the bonus materials on the second disc.  Jerry Schilling offers more details about Elvis' meeting with President Richard Nixon (even clips from an interview with Nixon is featured!) and talks about how Elvis gave all the cash he had with him to a soldier he meets on a plane coming home from Vietnam.

The king still manages to charm from beyond the grave.",1128643200,15,1264,4.722727272727273

2257539,4,B000852G4U,"I thought this gave new insight to the ""KIng"".  I know

I heard a lot of things I did not know.  They came from

2257540,5,B000852G4U,"after reading many of the reviews of the documentary, and especially the dvd set, i'm amazed at the negative comments. what will make these people happy?  here, i give you my thoughts on what i saw in it.  keep in mind, i just finished watching it and some of this is the wine talkin!

Priscilla (who is amazingly beautiful and seems to be aging at a rate of one year to every seven of our years!) is engaging and very forthcoming about her obvious affection for ol' 'E'.  this portrait is more honest, and filled with less bias than any documentary so far.  after Albert Goldman's turd of a book and everyone else who attacked, mocked and caricatured Elvis after his death, it's nice to find an intimate, mainly cheese-free study of who he was by the people who really loved him.

i liked him before this documentary and i like him even more now.

in no way, does the family portray Elvis as perfect, nor do they crucify him as an indulgent brat.  he comes off as someone who became caught up in something bigger than himself and did the best he could to exist in that wild place without complaining.  sure, Elvis could probably be an ass at times, but who isn't?  sure, he was fairly incapable of personal intimacy...but i didn't see any hatred from Priscilla.  in fact, with time, it seems she understands why he was this way and accepts him for it.  i don't feel she was self-serving in any way.  i also felt honored to hear things from HER personal perspective.  I read, 'Elvis and Me' when it came out and i believe the wounds were still fresh back then.  i didn't get the impression that there was any Presley propaganda or dirty laundry in what Cilla had to say here.

Elvis had control over Elvis' life and no one else.  Pricilla did a damn fine job with herself and she must be a pretty good egg to be standing by Elvis the way she has.  the Presley estate belongs to Lisa, not Pricilla.  i really don't get the impression that money is her motivating factor with this show.

Pricilla's parents btw, are some of the coolest people i've ever seen. i'm certain they had a large impact on Elvis' life and it's obvious they felt for him as a son.  i was glad to spend time with them as well as Cilla's sister. i'm sure you will too.  these are people who experienced the crazyness from a distance and if they had something negative to say, i believe they would've said it.

through the eyes of the documentary subjects (granted everyone under the Elvis sun wasn't included), i feel i understand Elvis  a little better.  frankly, i don't want to hear every filthy detail of his life.  this show does a wonderful job in breaking down the many facets of Elvis' life and giving you some insight into how they made up who he was.

sure it's a cliche to describe Elvis as a respectful, humble southern boy.  after watching this you believe it.  in fact, much of this is what i believe led to his downfall.  you get the impression that Elvis' career decisions were not necessarily his own and he didn't speak up out of respect, trust and loyalty for the Colonel and the companies to which he was contracted.  as horrible as the 60s movies and soundtracks were, you get the impression that Elvis did what he was told as a professional and did his complaining at home...and he suffered for it.

it's easy today, to laugh at Elvis and say he should have taken more control of his career.  i believe the documentary shows that Elvis was incapable of disloyalty and i like him for it.  i just read that Russell Crowe is making a settlement for 11 million dollars with a room service attendant in a New York hotel.  apparently, the phone didn't work well enough for Crowe and this poor, minimum wage schmuck had the phone tossed at his head.  the only reason Crowe is settling the case is due to US work permits being pulled.  wot an ass.  now, Elvis may have been a primadonna, but i sincerely doubt he would have engaged in such behaviour with people less fortunate than him.  in fact, the one's he may have tortured are the one's he loved...and that's something Elvis didn't invent.

from the documentary, you get the impression that Elvis was a good guy that tortured himself as much as he delighted in his life's gifts.  you see that these extreme emotions are what may have led to his early death.  his talent was his savior and his downfall.  all that remains is the record of his talent.  i tend to rate Elvis on his highs rather than his lows.

finally, it's the crafting of the documentary itself.  its just damn fun...period.  yes, there's a great deal of footage that you've seen before as other reviewers have mentioned.  however, they fail to see the pure craft in which the filmmakers use that footage.  most of the edits are absolutely tounge-in-cheek.  that's the point!  example: the shot of Elvis leaving the Lisa Marie and ""I Believe in the Man in the Sky"" song clip...it's fun!  that's the point!  Elvis + Flying Machine = Man/Sky...get it?  i like that the film is light and not pretentious or in corny glorification of Elvis.  i feel it's more akin to home movie night with the Presley's and you're invited.  i work in television myself, and from that point of view, these filmmakers did a consciously good job.

in the end, it's up to the individual viewer to decide.  if you're thinking about picking this DVD up, in this reviewer's opinion, get it!  it's fun, it's honest and it's sitting down with people you like sharing stories about a good guy who happened to be one of the most influential people of the twentieth century.  the DVD did it's job for me!",1124064000,45,5576,4.462376237623762

2257548,4,B000852G4U,"The most enjoyable part is the unused movie documentary footage of Elvis demonstrating Karate - he is totally focused, serious -but look again, his worldweary expression tells us why this ambitious project never really got off the ground - and by extension, why his involvement with the ""A Star Is Born"" remake led ultimately to heartbreak (for himself, his family, and his fans). Elvis' introspective, literary side is evoked through fascinating photos, etc., and a sensitive narration by his wife.
Another intriquing section is by Elvis buddy/producer/bodyguard/cool guy Jerry Schilling. His account of Presley's White House visit could support a major motion picture project. His understated storytelling is notable.
Ofcourse, Jerry is not a *Presley*, but like friend/musical advisor Charlie Hodge (who would have made a great contribution here, I'm sure), he is...family.
Perhaps the most memorable aspect of this DVD is the stunning beauty of Priscilla. That is said not to detract from her obvious intelligence or acting ability. (I wonder how she feels now about the ""Elvis And Me"" book and movie, which was not wholly positive about Elvis, as I recall).
Perhaps in another DVD the also-extraordinary beauty and talent Lisa Marie will get a chance to discuss a presumptive influence in her music by the ""Artist Of The Century"". Which leads me to say that we learn almost nothing about his music here - he played four instruments; sang convincingly in any genre. Is there no available previously unseen footage to comment on? (What about the 1955 ""Pied Piper Of Cleveland?"" movie short? That would be from right around the time Elvis met up with Jerry. Okay, I know it's considered ""lost""....).
The soundtrack features many, many cuts but they are sometimes used improperly. For example, we move to the segment about Elvis' plane, the Lisa Marie, and what do we hear? ""I Believe In The Man In The Sky"" (!). A gospel tune. Other times  something as magnificent as ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" is barely audible in the mix.

2257552,3,B000852G4U,"Anyone wishing to see a really good dvd of Elvis should buy the 1968 Comeback Special or the recut Thats the Way It Is. I am still hoping to see outtakes from ""Thats the Way It Is"". Some years ago when they recut the original  film which was then shown on Turner Movies with once again Priscilla giving the introduction they had  a special bonus of scenes that had been cut from the movie.  This was the only time they were shown. Also there is surely some material still out there from ""Elvis On Tour""that was left on the cutting room floor. So I am still hoping.

In the meantime,this dvd has some new material, mostly, pictures and home movies that I had not seen.  But, lets face it most of it is made up from other films and tv shows already done to death and those new pictures and film snippets were repeated a lot.  I enjoyed hearing Elvis sing as always and of course he looked great in all of the material seen of him, but then whats new. He was obviously one of the best looking men ever.  His story is very familiar, just about everyone he ever met or went out with or signed an autograph for has written a book or made a movie or been interviewed about their ""memories of Elvis"". This is not the first time Priscilla has ""let us"" share her memories and each time there are some revisions.  I can guess that she does not want to bring some facts forward as she has a daughter who obviously worshipped the ground her Father walked on and Lisa Marie probably doesn't want to remember that the only parent she has left may have played a big part in the loss of her other parent. However, I think under the circumstances that it might be wise to not mention how Lisa Marie did not respect some of the Memphis Mafia since in one place she slipped and nearly mentioned that she and her Mother were living in a small apartment with Mike Stone. Since Mike Stone and Priscilla had spouses and children from their marriages when they began seeing one another I find this somewhat irritating to listen to and hypocritical on Lisa's part to be criticizing others for behavior that her parents obviously indulged in. I also could do without the attempt to white wash the circumstances of the marriage breakup by Priscilla and her parents. In fact before the dvd was over I had decided that if I had been Elvis I would have avoided my Mother-in-law at all costs.  I really enjoyed hearing from his cousin Patsy who very obviously loved and misses her cousin. She is one of those who has not been heard from before as far as I know and must have a lot more to say-for instance she could have been asked about growing up with Elvis;memories of her Aunt Gladys etc. There is way too much about Priscilla and her parents(I was beginning to think the title was incorrect and should have been the courtship of Priscilla) and not enough from people like Patsy who probably have all sorts of recollections that would be new to us about Elvis and the Presleys. I also have always liked Jerry Schilling, but I feel he could have been a little more candid if he is going to do yet another piece on Elvis.  All in all if you are a fan as I am you may want to buy this dvd just for the home movies and few pictures not seen before.  Seeing Elvis having fun is great since we hear so much about how sad his life was most of the time. For those who weren't fans in the beginning as I was and would like to get a sense of his personality and talent and if you haven't seen much of or listened much to all of the material out there on Elvis, this will be a place to start.  But as I said in the beginning you should get the 68 Comeback Special to realize what a great talent Elvis Presley was and what a special person he was and how much more he could have accomplished if only.....",1117324800,5,3764,4.248951048951049
2257553,5,B000852G4U,"There is probably no single entertainer in our American culture that has been profiled more in recordings, TV specials, books, etc. than Elvis Presley, the undisputed King of Rock And Roll.  In fact, the amount of Elvis literature over the years would probably fill an entire bookstore.  Much of it, of course, is quite tawdry and has almost always focused more on the King's many eccentricities than the fact he had a life and that he touched millions.

But ELVIS BY THE PRESLEYS is a different matter altogether.  For this time around, we get to a much deeper side of Elvis through the people that knew him best, including former Memphis Mafia member Jerry Schilling, and most especially Elvis' wife Priscilla and daughter Lisa Marie.  All here testify to the kind of person that the press constantly ignored while he was alive, and still do even close to twenty-eight years after his untimely demise at age 42.  Through home movie footage of him, and the time he met his future wife Priscilla while stationed in Germany during his Army years, we see Elvis still as the King until the bitter end, but also the human being he always tried to be first and foremost.

We see his explosive entry onto the American scene in the mid-1950s.  We witness his return from Army life.  We witness his struggle with all the formulaic B-movies the Colonel forced him to make in the 1960s at the expense of making real recordings or far superior films.  We see his extraordinary comeback of 1968.  And at the end, of course, we see a very unhealthy-looking Elvis in the late spring of 1977 nevertheless giving everything he has left in him onstage, putting his own stamp on ""My Way.""

Both Priscilla and Lisa Marie are very candid but unsensationalistic in the way they describe the problems Elvis had, both with the Colonel's often questionable business decisions (made at the expense of Elvis' health and creativity) and his struggle with prescription medication, a struggle that he sadly lost.  But they also hold Elvis in the highest regard, as a great husband and father, and a tireless giver who never stopped giving and who never stopped caring.  I had the utmost respect for Elvis before, as the greatest pop music icon America has ever had.  After ELVIS BY THE PRESLEYS, I have an even greater respect for him as a human being.
