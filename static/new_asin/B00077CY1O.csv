8045485,2,B00077CY1O,"I ordered this DVD to be informative and beautiful. As something interesting to show friends the area I was going to visit. The DVD is poorly done. It has been dubbed over in several languages which is bothersome in the background. You will see the same photo throughout the video as is on the cover, it makes one want to count how many times it is repeated. That continues throughout the video, so many of the same shots are used over and over. Content is lacking, the chef demonstration should not even be part of this. Not to mention it is no secret for any culinary student. You can learn if from Julia Child. Linderhof, the only one of Ludwig's castles to be completed and much of Neuschwanstein's inception comes from there is not even mentioned. Look for a different DVD. Although it certainly is shot in the right area, the outcome is for a child.",1393632000,9,855,4.487179487179487
