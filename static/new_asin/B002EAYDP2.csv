8367164,5,B002EAYDP2,I love Frances Langford. She was sweet and pretty and had a great voice. It's too bad that she is almost forgotten. She deserves to be remembered and appreciated. She sang to a lot of home sick troops.,1496620800,,201,4.315789473684211

8367167,4,B002EAYDP2,"Only about 7 minutes of this picture show the crew with their B-29, probably shot on a stateside base and in the studio, with some wartime aerial footage and model shots of the Jap Zeros.  Not many films featured the B-29, so it's great to see it but don't expect to see too much.  The film also has a high wing civil monoplane at the end in model and studio shots.  The film is entertaining otherwise.

The running time on the DVD case reads 110 min., but the time of 67 min. listed by Amazon is accurate.",1371772800,,506,4.185567010309279

8367169,5,B002EAYDP2,"Frances Langford stars in this delightful, fast paced musical romance set in WWII.  In an era of great vocalists, Miss Langford stands above all the rest with her melting pianissimo's and her sultry creamy contralto sound.  Right here I would like to explode the myth that she wasn't a good actress.  Just watch this movie.  That's enough to put that lie to rest.  She is always an engaging, warm and convincing actress.  Getting right to the heart of her character.  A more charming winsome actress there never was.  The songs including 'I'm good for nothing but love"", Dreamng out loud"". ""Right along about evening"", ""Moonlight over the islands', showcase her beautiful voice perfectly.  Russell Wade is very convincing as Capt. Patrick Ransom in love with Louise Anderson, the Bamboo Blond, but how tough of an acting assignment is being in love with Frances Langford?  It had to be the role of his career!  Ralph Edwards is superb as Eddie Clark, the night club owner.  Iris Adrian brings her own particular charm to the role of Montana.  What a great character actress!  Paul Harvey, Jane Greer and Dorothy Vaughn  bring their veteran experience to round out this tight ensemble.  Anthony Mann commands a tight ship and keeps things moving along nicely.  Warner Brothers has produced a wonder clean DVD of this wonderful movie.  Now if they would only add some more of Frances Langfords movies such as ""Swing it Soldier"", ""Cowboy in Manhatten"", ""Hit Parade of 1941"", ""Beat the Band"".  Frances Langford needs to be rediscovered.  She spent years of her life touring with Bob Hope doing USO shows bringing joy to our fighting forces all over the world.  The ""Sweetheart of the Fighting Forces"" must not be forgotten.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Will-I-Ever-Know/dp/1432720929/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Will I Ever Know</a>",1264032000,,1867,5.282312925170068
8367170,5,B002EAYDP2,"PLOT: World War 2 crew who has the WORST record for ""bombing"" around has his BUDDIES paint a girl he barely knows on the side of the plane and the FAMOUS ""BAMOO BLONDE"" BECOMES A LEGEND~ SO DOES THE CREW~ NOW THE Hero has charm the girl into a ""bond drive"" and publicity tour the problem being he only met her once~ PURE FUN~

LOVELY Frances Langford is a singer in ""out of bounds"" / no service men allowed and in walks Flyboy Ransom headed over seas~ she thinks he is a sly farm boy  not realizing he is WEALTHY Patrick Ramsom Junior. HE barely knows the girl who has her photo taken with him before he flies out of site and his crew finds the photo in a wallet and decides the BLONDE is just what the B29 needs~ soon  ""LOUISE"" (Frances Langford) adorns the front of the B29 in glorious color with a serong no less and is dubbed the ""BAMBOO BLONDE"" AFTER HER GOLDEN LOCKS~ soon ""new good luck charm Bamboo Blonde Logo"" has the crew become one of the MOST famous bomber crews in the last days of the War~ so when the now famous crew head home for a PUBLICITY TOUR they want the REAL BAMBOO BLONDE TO SHARE THE FAME with the Bomber Crew~. Meanwhile Louise and her pushy agent (Ralph Edwards) uses the fame of the BLONDE to improve their stale night club business who soon is a HOT spot~ fun here is Langford is spicy and cute and sincere and sings some great songs~ is very attracted to Russell Wade (Ransom) and has NO idea how wealthy he is~ add fiance JANE GREER who rides a broom every step of the way keeps the romance from going forward~ but Ramsom who shyly purses Louise. Too bad we did not see Russell Wade in more movies he is quite good. I GIVE THIS DATED BUT FUN MUSICAL WITH A FEEL GOOD WAR STORY ROMANCE AN 8 OUT OF 10 for humor, and great Frances Langford and lesser known hero Wade makes this a good watch. CUTE~",1253404800,,1827,4.169971671388102
