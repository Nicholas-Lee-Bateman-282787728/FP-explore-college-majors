5165407,5,B008HUSFG6,"I have to say that I grew up on Power Rangers and saw the promos for this show on VHS releases of Power Rangers when I was a kid, but never watched it until now. Without a doubt it's a knock off show born from the rise of the success of Power Rangers (during it's most popular time) but for knock offs it's actually really good. Watching it as an adult is hilarious and it's surprisingly entertaining. And actually feels more action packed then Power Rangers at times. If you love Rangers then this is worth the watch.",1349222400,,518,4.295918367346939
5165408,4,B008HUSFG6,"I remember this show from when it first came out and I always remembered how great I felt the martial arts was in the series. Not only that, but there also was some good acting on the part of a number of the actors in the show as well. All these years later it is fun to reminisce about my younger years and see the show again. I see it now through different glasses per se, but the show is still fun and the show was definitely engaging. While I can see why other shows replaced it ultimately, anyone who enjoys shows like power rangers or the like will also love this show as well! There are no special features on this DVD, but you will find a very high quality production on this DVD, and as always a good series to keep you entertained for hours to come!",1348617600,,759,4.100671140939597
5165409,5,B008HUSFG6,"Saban should have created at least another 13 episodes of not just VR Troopers , but also the BeetleBorgs with all the villains being destroyed instead of ending them both in a cliff hanger . I F*****G HATE CLIFF HANGERS !!!!!!!!! He could have even made a movie or movies about them , aswell as a 2 part episode team up based on the Power Rangers Turbo VS BeetleBorgs Metalix paperback .",1348099200,,388,4.402777777777778
5165410,3,B008HUSFG6,"Yeah, it's nostalgic and brings back a lot of childhood memories for me.  In fact, this show was one of the main reasons why I skipped school so much.  However, after watching a couple of episodes of this show as an adult I would have to say VR Troopers didn't stand the test of time.  I still have a couple of VHS episodes and the action figures laying around somewhere, but I can't say that I will make the investment to purchase this item.  Don't get me wrong, the price is good for the whole season but this is not 17 years ago.  As an adult, I find the show to be corny, silly, badly scripted and cheaply produced.  However, it was good for the time that it came out.  As a kid, I found the show to be great, funny, interesting and impressive.  Also found it to be better and more intense than its big brother Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.

  There's nothing like the Skugs who starts off as normal looking people who smart-mouth others for questioning them before transforming into combative foot soldiers.  I can't really picture grown adults buying this show to view for themselves.  However, I do think that kids would still appreciate it even if they see it as ""old"" or whatever.  If I had kids, I would definitely get it for them to watch and I'd probably watch a few episodes with them.  About 2 episode would probably be all that I could tolerate now.  Maybe they should run it on TV around after school hours to see how today's kids would like it.  I'm not knocking the show, because it was definitely one of my favorites of the 90s but time progresses quickly.  If this was 1995-96 or shortly after, this would be a 5 star product without question but it's 2012.  I support the idea of releasing this series, but I will not support it by investing in it.  Once more, didn't stand the test of time.",1346371200,,1813,4.3552238805970145
5165411,5,B008HUSFG6,I bought this at Power Morphicon 3 they had it for sale early only for the weekend. No special features but video quality is really good so glad this is finally came out! I asked if the remaining seasons will come out for sure and Shout Factory told me yes they will release the complete series.,1345593600,6,295,4.285714285714286
5165412,5,B008HUSFG6,"A great show that unfortunately didn't last too long. What's interesting here is that there was a pilot for this show that I think didn't air. It was a Cybertron pilot. I think VR Troopers was originally called Cybertron before being renamed. the role of Ryan Steele was played by Jason David Frank. But for remains unknown to me, the role was then given to Brad Hawkins. He portrayed Ryan best. The Grimlord character was excellently portrayed as well. I wish the show lasted longer than it did.  But I'm glad it's finally getting released. About time!

Can't wait to watch this again.",1344816000,3,586,4.679611650485437

5165457,4,B008HUSFG6,"This show is great. It has a very campy bad guy that is trying to take over ""Virtual Reality"" and the three ""Troopers"" have been chosen to travel from the real world to stop the bad guy's minions from taking over ""Reality."" The show teaches teamwork, friendship, and standing up for the little guy. The acting is kind of low budget, but it was made by the same people that made Power Rangers, so you know what to expect when watching it. You know, fake monsters in cheesy costumes and low budget explosions. All in all, if you do not watch it for the acting and special effects, then the show is ok. My kids love it.",1410998400,,616,4.273504273504273

I tried to watch the first episode again and couldn't even make it half way through. The villain was way over the top and the main character lost my interest as soon as he spoke.",1404259200,,325,4.603448275862069

5165487,5,B008HUSFG6,"We had never heard of it before seeing it offered on Amazon Prime streaming, but it's a favorite of my 8 year old son now!",1365033600,,122,3.92
5165488,4,B008HUSFG6,"Ryan Steele is a troubled young man that for most of his teenage life had to do without the love of his father, who mysteriously went missing. Then one day, he along with his friends J.B. & Kate discovered that his father was still very much alive but in another dimension that you may have heard of called ""Virtual Reality"". They are told by the disembodied head of Professor Hart that it was Grimlord's doing, a sinister reptilian being that hopes to bridge the gap between our reality and Virtual Reality and conquer both worlds. The trio are given strange pendants that when held aloft, turn them them into the metal plated task force known as V.R. Troopers.

Unlike Saban's other shows as the time, V.R. Troopers ran only in syndication and not exclusively on any one network. This allowed them to give the series a much darker tone then say something like Power Rangers would have. One of the major downfalls of the show however is that it's comprised of stock footage from three entire different shows (Choujinki Metalder, Jikuu Senshi Spielban, & Space Sheriff Shaider) from Japan that were under the umbrella of the ""Metal Hero"" franchise. This umbrella also extends to Juukou B-Fighter & B-Fighter Kabuto, which were later adapted into the god awful Big Bad Beetleborgs and Beetleborgs Metallix respectively.

Ryan's action sequences were comprised of Metalder and Shaider (season 2) footage, while J.B. & Kate's were Spielban. This resulted in a very disjointed show seeing as how Ryan could not indirectly interact with J.B. or Kate when stock footage was used. There's also the issue of the........ummm, how can I put this?.....very inaccurate suits of the three for the American footage portion. J.B. & Kate's Spielban suits are horrendously bulky and the left side of Ryan's Metalder suit, which in the Japanese footage has various bips and bops of circuitry, is nothing but dull blue plastic. Not to mention the easily recognizable and re purposed MMMPR Red Ranger helmets for the Battle Grid segments.

Regardless of these key factoids, the show is still very much enjoyable and tries to do something a little different with the foundation laid down by it's big brother. Obviously the Virtual Reality fad of the 1990's played a prominent role in the show's overall theme and might seem a slight bit dated to someone observing it out of context. But it's purely for the sake of fun and campy goodness.",1363651200,,2417,4.890243902439025
5165489,5,B008HUSFG6,"This is another show I grew up watching, along side Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Many people will say this show is a rip-off of Power Rangers. I wouldn't. You can say it is similar in many ways, and different in others. I am just glad they finally started putting this show on DVD. The quality is pretty good for it being an older show.",1363219200,,337,4.28125
5165490,5,B008HUSFG6,"Now this show right here takes me back to a time of my very childhood of the 90's watching the like's of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (MMPR) and Masked Rider,now these show's have a lot in common kid's forced to stand alone or to stand as a team and save the world from destruction.
This show VR Troopers has a lot to offer it teaches kid's and adult's alike to stand out make a difference in the world no matter your capabilities as a human being knowing to believe in yourself that you can succeed, sound's corny i know but what do you expect it was the 90's.
The VR Troopers is a show about a group of 3 young teenagers who's names are ryan steele, J.B and katlin they were summoned by professor hart to give message to ryan steele from his father and stop grim lord from his attack's on the virtual reality world much similar to the power rangers considering the fact that show was created by the same producer ""Haim Saban"" if your an avid fan of the power rangers i really suggest picking this up you'll love it this DVD however regrettably has no extras or features but overall is still a great show",1362700800,,1106,4.29665071770335

5165493,5,B008HUSFG6,"I'am so happy that, I bought this dvd box set. When this debuted on tv, in 1994. I was 13 going on 14, and starting my freshman year. Of high school,anyway I read another customer review. And found out that, they were going to release the complete series. Any fan of the show, should definetly. Buy this series it would be a welcome, addition to your dvd collection.",1351468800,,366,4.397058823529412
5165494,5,B008HUSFG6,"As a ten-year-old child, I always looked forward to catching VR Troopers after school. I was always excited to see how Ryan, Kaitlin, and JB would foil Grimlord's latest evil scheme. This was a show that I loved so much, and for many years I have been praying for a DVD release. Thanks to Shout Factory, that dream has finally come true, and for VR Trooper fans such as myself, the long wait was definitely worth it.

The show is still as wonderful as I remember it, with its action-packed battles providing a lot of excitement and story lines regarding friendship, teamwork, etc. that still hold up well today. Ryan was and still is my favorite Trooper, though Kaitlin and JB are also pretty cool. Grimlord, and his human alter-ego Karl Ziktor, are effectively creepy, and his many mutant minions are equally menacing. Jeb, the talking dog, provides the best comic relief on the show. Many of the other characters such as Tao and Professor Hart are also as appealing now as they were all those years ago. The only regular character I could never stand was Percy, who I felt was quite an annoyance, but just about all the other characters are awesome to some extent.

The episodes on this set (26 in all) provide plenty of entertainment. The two-part story The Battle Begins sets up the story quite nicely, as it shows how the Troopers became the defenders of our reality, their first Skug battle, how Jeb gained the ability to speak, and the beginning of the ongoing plot point of Ryan's search for his long-lost father. Other episodes on this set have the Troopers rescuing Jeb from Grimlord's minions (The Dognapping), trying to help Ryan when he's suffering from amnesia (Lost Memories), dealing with a magician who steals Kaitlin and JB's virtualizers (A Dirty Trick), investigating some earthquakes that hit Crossworld City (Digging for Fire), and much more. Fans who grew up with the series, as well as people who never saw the show before, are sure to find at least a few great episode on the set that are worth checking out.

All in all, this is a wonderful DVD debut for a great series. I cannot wait for the rest of Season 1 as well as Season 2 to be released. Until then, check out this show, which is an amazing example of how terrific children's shows were back in the 90s.",1349913600,2,2287,4.614250614250614
