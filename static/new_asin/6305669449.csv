1074285,5,6305669449,"This is a dvd you play over and over. I have seen fourplay in concert plus I have all of the albums from the group, even my son who is a teenager that loves rap liked this dvd , does not get any better than this thats for sure.",1106524800,4,227,3.6530612244897958
1074286,5,6305669449,"Just came back from a Fourplay concert, front row, and was overwhelmed and thouroughly entertained by the richness of the band's talent. I'm giving this DVD a 5 star even though I've never seen it only because it's the only thing available that will help me to relive the best concert I've ever seen!",1100476800,3,300,4.574074074074074
1074287,5,6305669449,"I agree with Daniel A. Hess. I am a long time Lee Ritenour fan, and have everything he has released on vinyl, CD, VHS and DVD. The VHS/DVD's vary in quality and performance. Some have good video and fair audio. Some have good audio and fair video. The perfomance,camera work and audio are excellent here, and they look like they're really having fun performing together. Even though I am also a Larry Carlton fan, I wish Lee had stayed with Fourplay.
The only drawback is this should have a Dolby 5.1 or DTS soundtrack.",1068768000,9,519,4.531914893617022
1074288,5,6305669449,"ONE OF THE BEST DVD AND SOUND RECORDINGS I'VE HEARD.  AN EVENING
OF FOURPLAY IS SIMPLY MY FAVORITE DVD!",1062547200,4,103,4.421052631578948
1074289,3,6305669449,the music is great!....  stereo does not do it justice....wish it was in dolby digital format.,1045353600,4,94,4.875
1074290,1,6305669449,"Safe chord sequences with bland octave melodies(x a few even
numbered bars) 1x soloist,repeat melody next soloist, etc. etc.
Good sound,production & performance,zero innovation.
A small notch above elevator muzak.",1042329600,2,213,6.133333333333334
1074291,5,6305669449,"Very good concert, very good performances, very good music, very good sound, resuming: 5 stars. But not everything's perfect; in ""volume one"" you hear a thing while you watch another. The audio-video sync has not been what I was expecting of a DVD (as it has happened in many other occassions). When I buy a concert of such talented musicians, I want to see how're they playing in real time, not that stupid delay. Volume 2 is OK.",1041984000,3,430,4.5256410256410255
1074292,5,6305669449,"It's a pity William (Bill) Tyson did not give me his copy of this DVD for my 50th Birthday - I had to buy my own!  Nonetheless, I completely agree its a great DVD and just perfect for afeter dinner relaxing.  Lets have some more recent material on DVD please.",1037145600,,259,4.16
1074293,5,6305669449,"I bought this DVD and have played it many times, particularly when we have company over.  It is truly a crowd pleaser!  I am buying my second DVD since I gave my first to my brother-in-law for his 50th Birthday.",1027987200,,211,4.25
1074294,4,6305669449,"This DVD is not even 5.1 surround , but the sound is excellent. Yes you do have to crank the volume up a little bit more but the result is astounding. Use good playback equipment like revell sub and willson puppies with mark levinson amps. and enjoy the artistry and the strange jacket that Lee is wearing!",1023580800,,306,4.385964912280702
1074385,5,6305669449,This was fantastic I would love to see more just like this from them. All great musican should record sets like this one.,1008806400,,121,4.304347826086956
1074386,1,6305669449,"The recording level is so low. When you crank it up, there is a loud hum which make it annoying to enjoy. I collected lots of music DVD and have tried this DVD with Nakamichi 1A1z (.01 THD) and Yamaha V1000 (.04 THD) with same result (distorted). Avoid!
However, my rating for the content is 5 stars.  Musianship, guest stars, backup singers, song selections are world class. Rating for video is 3.5 star due to limitation of the location (inside a studio). What are they (audio eng.) thinking? This is a superb performance by world class musicians ruins by audio mastering! Unacceptable!",1000252800,4,588,4.764705882352941
1074387,4,6305669449,"This DVD is a good example of excellent teamwork. The quality of the sound and video is good. The reason for a rating of four is because there was one track with low recording. This is a great DVD to play, seatback and enjoy the music.",997574400,,235,4.130434782608695
1074388,2,6305669449,"With today Technology with 5.1 or DTS this DVD do not have either. The Video is very poor, with the lighting making the proformers turn the color of blue.  True, the music is good. But no excuse for not producing a better DVD. Take a lesson or look at the quality of George Benson or SANTANA. If you compare these titles you will indeed be very disapointment at FOURPLAY quality.",991526400,,379,4.414285714285715
1074389,5,6305669449,"Es sencillamente increible y gratificante cmo se puede hacer tan buena msica con pocas personas, cada integrante del grupo sabe lo necesario para lograr estos niveles de calidad en jazz. Haba escuchado antes a Forplay en CD's pero definitivamente es otra cosa verlos en video, si gustan de forplay en CD's esto es sencillamente gratificante.",982627200,,341,5.218181818181818
1074390,2,6305669449,Audio is poorly miked at times. Lighting frequently faults to blue red etc...Next time get a tech teams as straight ahead as this great jazz group.,973728000,,147,4.6923076923076925
1074391,5,6305669449,"If you love smooth jazz, with an emphasis on smooth, then you must be aware of the band called FOURPLAY. This live recording is proof-positive of the genius of each member of this extraordinary band. Harvey Mason makes playing the drums look effortless and reminds everyone of us when we first discovered how much fun it seemed being a drummer must be. Bob James is the reference standard for today's would-be jazz pianist, and this DVD shows off his talent very well. Nathan East and Lee Ritenour are dazzling in their performances as are the guests, Phillip Bailey, Phil Perry, and none other than CHAKA KAHN! This DVD is a ""Must-Have"" for anyone who enjoys seeing and hearing great, smooth, contemporary jazz.",970358400,23,712,4.844262295081967
1074392,5,6305669449,"This is a great DVD for obvious reasons. You get a talented group like Fourplay to perform many of their hits in front of a small crowd, and the sound is outstanding. The visuals are perfect, and you get to see each  member up close!  The guest stars are a nice bonus too!  Philip Bailey (of  Earth Wind & Fire), Phil Perry (needs to learn some restraint! ), and  the 'fabulous' Chaka Khan, who shows why she is popular among Jazz  musicians. If you love contemporary jazz, invest in this DVD!",962323200,13,493,4.362637362637362
1074393,5,6305669449,"The sound was excellent (stereo -- not Dolby 5.1), and the lighting/editing/cinematography was good.  But the musicianship was OUTSTANDING.  Bob James was fantastic, Lee Ritenour was phenominal, Harvey  Mason was dynamic, and Nathan East was incredible!",959299200,4,253,5.972222222222222
1074394,4,6305669449,"This DVD is what having a DVD player is all about. I find it amazing that there are companies pushing to make a 1942 black and white, monophonic Jimmy Stewart movie, yet us jazz and music lovers have a handful of options  to select from to keep our palette full. Fourplay has outdone many of the  others, because they saw the value in just PLAYING music! We get the  benefits, because this is one can can sit back and enjoy, without the  remote ""skip"" control at the ready. Solid performances by one the  ever changing FAB FOUR, with great guest performances by the likes of Phil  Bailey of EW&F, and Chaka Kahn. So get between the sheets and enjoy  this digital masterpiece, it is worth every dime and then some!",956188800,5,713,4.438461538461539

7894987,5,6305669449,"Fourplay joins four great musicians, and makes a remarkable sound, that includes modern and classic jazz, and some pop standards, all with an incredible swing. Really sensacional!",1359331200,,179,5.666666666666667
7894988,5,6305669449,"I thought owning all tapes and CDs by Fourplay was all I needed, until I received this DVD. The seller sent an e-mail to let me know my DVD was on the way, and added a comment to ""Enjoy"".  Words cannot explain how much I have enjoyed this concert, and look forward to purchase others.  I have passed it around to others that follow Fourplay and they have also expressed the same comments......too little, too much, where is more! I recommend this concert to all Fourplay followers and smooth jazz listeners!!",1181347200,,508,4.571428571428571
7894989,5,6305669449,"Simply said, this DVD is a must-have for those who love smooth jazz, the music of Fourplay, especially Lee Ritenour. Lee pretty much 'steal' the show. The synergy that made Fourplay special in the early 90's is clearly demonstrated, and it's a great pity that Lee is no longer with them. Nothing against Larry Carlton who took over after Lee left, but there no longer the powerful synergy and creativity in Fourplay later releases. The audio volume is a bit low, but quality is great. I especially enjoy the beautiful editing, very watchable, unlike the fast cartoon-like editing common in pop/rock that degrade the music and spin the head.",1107820800,5,640,4.8807339449541285
