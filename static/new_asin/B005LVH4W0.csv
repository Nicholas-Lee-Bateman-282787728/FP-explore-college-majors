8478648,3,B005LVH4W0,"This DVD appears to be very similar to this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elton-Billy-Joel-Piano-Tokyo/dp/B002BO2RSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elton Billy Joel  Piano Tokyo</a>&nbsp;""Elton John & Billy Joel- The Piano Men Live in Tokyo (2009)"" so read the 21+ reviews from it as well.

As noted in the reviews for the similar/identical (?) DVD above, this appears to be another version (but from NY, not from Argentina) of the 1998 concert in the Tokyo Dome.  Like the Amazon title, this DVD shows 2011 on the back cover but you'll find 2008 in the closing video credit (with acoustic guitar).

But unlike the above reviews that talk about bad editing, implying a camcorder bootleg, etc., the original camera work was top notch, multi-cameras, reasonably good editing, split screen, etc.  But it is the transfer from 1998 analog to DVD that is horrible -- VHS quality at best.  The video resolution was just good enough that I was able to make out the fact that Elton John played on a Yamaha and Billy Joel chose a Steinway.

And despite offering both Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1, the sound is weak.  Also, the same ""BWF"" mentioned in other reviews also shows up in this DVD, in the bottom right corner of the screen, and implies this was copied off of a TV broadcast.

The DVD images are deceptive too, Billy Joel had hair in 1998, the cover image?  not so much -- but making people think this was a more recent concert tour.  But even in 1998 when the two great entertainers hugged, I thought of John Pinette hugging Ralphie May -- the men are much larger than they were in the mid/late 70s.

Content?  The duets were great, but there were no Elton John solos and too much Billy Joel for my taste.  This concert is from the Face to Face 1998 tour described here:  [...] and you can see the set lists and how much was cut from this DVD.

If I had paid more for this DVD, I might feel ripped off -- but it's not worth my time to return it.  But it is worth my time to warn others about this.",1386633600,,2036,4.674157303370786

8478650,1,B005LVH4W0,The transfer of this DVD looks like a very bad bootleg recording. To say that this is low definition is putting it mildly. Honestly this DVD looks like it was downloaded from the internet and then burnt to a DVD from a home computer. There is nothing professional about this DVD at all. Stay away.,1323561600,2,297,4.418181818181818
8478651,5,B005LVH4W0,"I have a special fondness for piano duets.  This DVD delivers much to satisfy.  Beautiful music.  Great rapport with the crowd and each other lends to the charisma of Billy Joel and Elton John.  I bought it for a few songs that were my favorites and due to the skilled hands and voices in this duo, I now have several more favorites.",1322697600,,333,4.32258064516129
