8592415,3,B000UVV2GK,"I can only add a little to the other, very thorough review.  Despite the great fight scene with Kurata and Chiba, someone looking for the Chiba of ""Streetfighter"" will be disappointed because this really is a different kind of movie. The English title makes it sound like a serious movie, but this is all comedy. The Japanese title, ""Master of Thunder"", is written in a cartoon font that makes the viewer immediately aware of it.  The group that fights the demon are different stereotypes of modern Japan; an ""Otaku"" geek,  an anime girl who works in Akihabara, an African (who is portrayed in a rather racist manner), and so on.  An enjoyable tongue-in cheek-commentary on youth in Japan using traditional Japanese themes of cooperation,loyalty and friendship.

Rating:  3.5/ 5 stars.

Special features include stills, filmographies (severely truncated for Chiba and Kurata) and Biographies.  The behind the scenes featurette is interesting enough, but not subtitled.",1247616000,2,968,5.240259740259741
