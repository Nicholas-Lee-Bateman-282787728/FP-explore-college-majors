7320042,5,B0112HPWX4,"The Sharknado films just keep getting cheesier, better and awesomer. I love that they know it's silly, but they embrace it. From saving the President in Washington DC, from saving everyone at Universal Orlando, and even all the way in outer space, Fin Shepard is back and ready to fight the biggest Sharknado yet. Keep a look out for all the cameos and references to other great films. Be sure to watch after the credits, because there is a scene that involves the fate of April.

7320148,4,B0112HPWX4,"First of all if you've seen this 3rd movie its safe to say you liked the series enough to make it this far. This one is possibly even more silly & outrageous then the other 2 but its still all the better for it. One thing I really liked was the return of the character Nova (Cassie Scarbo). Ive always enjoyed her character way more then April (Tara Reid). It also seems they never run out of crazy ways to have people get killed by sharks which is a good thing. Basic plot is Fin returns & deals with Sharknados all along the east coast this time & has to come up with an even crazier way to stop them. Lots of celebrity cameos once again like Chris Jericho, Jerry Springer, George R. R. Martin just to name a few. If you are already a fan of the series then you should obviously check this out & for those of you new start with the first film & enjoy the crazy ride. Extras include commentary, interviews, featuretts on SFX & other parts of production, trailers & a sneak peak at the Sharknado documentary.",1464739200,,1008,4.227979274611399

7320166,5,B0112HPWX4,This 3rd addition to the Sharknado series of movies is great. I loved the first two number 3 makes it even better. Great syfy. I'm hooked on sharknado!!!,1457481600,,153,4.5
7320167,5,B0112HPWX4,I had a huge party when it came out. House was decorated with sharks of every size. We are all waiting for Sharknado 4 to come out this July.

7320170,5,B0112HPWX4,Great fun! =D,1455321600,,13,3.6666666666666665
7320171,5,B0112HPWX4,"If you saw the second feature, you know what to expect, a climax that topped the previous film. Sharknados appear along the east coast as it seem only the Shepard family can kill them off. Nova (Cassie Scerbo) returns from the first feature after taking a hiatus during the second feature. She provided the film with a lot of cleavage eye candy.

Sharknado is a cult classic film series that I can only compare to the old Batman TV series. No one took it seriously and everyone who is famous wants to be in it, even if only to be shark food. The opening credits appear to be a Bond film and it ends in a way we might expect a Bond film to end...minus the inane stuff. President Mark Cuban says that he called a shark once, a reference to his appearances on ""The Shark Tank."" Ann Coulter plays the VP and her escape scene is well...eat your heart out Orlando Bloom. In one scene they kill a shark with the American flag on a pole, imitating the famous Iwo Jima pose. There is a scene from SyFy's ""3 Headed Shark Attack"" in a theater as well as ""Game of Throne"" references. Anthony Weiner now works for NASA. WWF stars and NASCAR.

Clearly this film series has gotten life with no end in sight. You will either love it for what it is, or not. I suggest watching the other features first as there is zero character build up. 8 minutes into the film, people are getting eaten.",1455148800,2,1372,4.293436293436294

7320173,5,B0112HPWX4,"Ummm.... for those in ythe market of cheesy bad assed blood and gore sharks vs. humans mayhem, look no further than the Sharknado series. I can't wait for the next one.... yes... there will be another. I think the producers at SyFy know better then to end a series like that.... By the way, for science fiction nuts.... this third installment is definitely in the realm of ""out there"". You know what? That's terrific! For the schmoes who watch movies and go to the movies and behave like ""Buzz Killington""..... this movie isn't for you. I think people lost the idea of the movie experience to begin with. Movies are allowed to break the realm of reality and possibility. Isn't that the whole point?  Imagination and fantasy rolled into unbelievable circumstances.... There's nothing better than watching a group of Americans holding up a flag pole donned with the Stars and Stripes impaling a vicious blood thirsty shark. Call it what you will.... Damn I love this country, it's cinema, and possibility always in question. Hooah!!!",1453766400,,1031,4.8914285714285715

This 3rd Sharknado, was a must see, if only to say we saw it.  If a fourth Sharknado comes out, Please please no!. We will try to resist, but I'm pretty sure, we will have to see it, too.

It is really fun watching this insane movie! You must COMPLETELY suspend belief or you just won't get it!

Especially with just rushing Fin into the beginning from out of no where. Um, ok, I get it, not a whole lot should be expected from a franchise like this and I get that it's all in good fun but at least get us up to speed first with what led up to the events of the beginning of the movie! Anyway, regardless, I like the 2nd movie better than this installment. Some funny goofs and IMPOSSIBLE odds thrown in there are usual with a REDICULOUS ending in which yeah, I laughed, it was good.

It's still full of sharknado-y greatness and I can't wait for the fourth one.

7320409,5,B0112HPWX4,"Another great sequel in the franchise. Very polished film with great f/x. Only drawback to this film are all the cameos. Love the original because there is not all the focus on the cameos. Get back to Fin battling sharks more. Everyone seems like they are heroes in this one. More fin Asylum films, I repeat more Fin!!!!",1444521600,,320,4.5344827586206895
7320410,5,B0112HPWX4,"The 3rd in the hugely popular franchise and I frakking loved it! The shark attacks were even more creative and the cameos were cool,who can forget the entire Today cast biting it? And the sharks in space? Genius! Try to get past the fact they shouldn't have survived in the first place. Sharknado 4? OH HELL YES!!!",1444435200,,314,4.526315789473684

7320412,5,B0112HPWX4,"Yes, it's  kind of impossible.  So what! You don't expect super complex plot from the title.  It would be.like watching a Time Burton movie and expecting  ""serious."" It ain't gonna  happen.  Good  action,  good special effects,  good cameos. It's a great sequel.  Number 5 is on the way. Fun film!",1444262400,,297,4.76
7320413,4,B0112HPWX4,"Sharknado 1 blew people's minds with the concept: it was hilarious, surreal, and a heck of a lot of fun. Sharknado 2 was Sharknado 1 on steroids. What do you get when a Sharknado meets a chainsaw-wielding ex-surfer? A great movie. Sharknado 3 seemed to run out of steam after the first 15 minutes (where Washington D.C. gets destroyed by a sharknado). Parts of this dragged. Still, I'm looking forward to Sharknado 4!",1444262400,,417,4.726027397260274

7320415,4,B0112HPWX4,"I really enjoy this franchise. Not as much as ""Final Destination"" series because here the deaths are the same over and over...sudden shark bite or smash. But just when I was getting tired of it, they managed to surprise me with the space shuttle scene and the - now widely revealed - climax with Fin being swallowed bu a shark and Tara Reid having ""Gill' the baby inside the shark with her clothes on. A chainsaw lightsaber? AWESOME!
Can't wait for 4!",1441065600,5,451,4.512195121951219
