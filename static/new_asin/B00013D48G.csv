1969002,1,B00013D48G,"The Czechs are weird. I think their archetypal imagery is pretty far gone from what mine is because I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on during most of this extrememly strange sex and incest ridden fairy tale about a young girl's burgeoning sexuality (I think) and vampires with no dental plan. Right from the start, it's clear this was made in the early 70's or so. It takes about ten minutes for one to start remembering stumbling across something like it when you were young and swearing off odd-ball foreign films until you came across ""Delicatessen"" or ""La Femme Nikita"" or some such classic. Really, this is like those norway mythological films they used to savage on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" only without a Harryhausen imitator to pick up the slow points.
So basically, Valerie is a sweet young thing who finds that her earrings are magical, protect her from all harm, and let her see her seemingly idyllic village for what it really is (?), a lair of the undead, her face-painted-white-to-indicate-she's-old granny soon to be among them. Everyone is crewing in fields or getting bitten by these Deliverance-toothed vampires, her brother is alternately trying to screw her and getting tortured by the main vampire guy who is either or grandfather or her father, the town priest is also trying to screw her and trying unsuccessfully to burn her at the stake when she spurns his advances. I'm at a loss why so many people are ""discovering"" this film now and raving about it. Perhaps for laughing and throwing out lines with a bunch of friends, its perfect, but other than that....well, at least it's short. I can understand the appreciation of surreal symbolism heavy non-narrative filmmaking. Watch Jean Luc-Goddard's ""Weekend"" or Alejandro Jodorosky's ""The Holy Mountain"", but this is just plain silly nonsensical olan-mills lit crap.",1077494400,13,1859,4.980707395498392
1969003,5,B00013D48G,"For years, I'd read about this film, then I managed to track down a bootleg video copy of it in the mid-90s.  Even though that video was in less than prime condition, the brilliance of the film shined through anyway.
The first time I watched VALERIE..., I really had no idea what it was about, but the haunting visuals and score--oh, what music!--entranced me.  I've watched the film many times since then, including during its recent U.S. arthouse run, and, each time, I feel like I'm unlocking some puzzle.  On the surface, it's all so simple, but underneath, it's something else entirely.
Then there is Valerie, one of the most charming film heroines I've ever encountered.  Imagine watching a young Kate Bush in a fantasy film, and you'll understand what I mean.  It's a testiment to the director's sensitivity and the acting ability of the actress who plays Valerie that this film doesn't sucumb to soft-porn cliches or mawkishness.  Ravishing.

1969007,4,B00013D48G,"The Czech New Wave film Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (1970) [Czech: Valerie a tden divu] is another example of the worldwide nature of ephebophilia. This is the first time that I've written about ephebophilia in the Czech Republic. A number of countries were covered in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Allure-of-Nymphets/dp/B00B6KKY1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Allure of Nymphets</a>, but not the Czech Republic.

In this Czechoslovakian film, 13-year-old Valerie (Jaroslava Schallerov) is sought after by men and women - friends and relatives. For example, Valerie is saved from being aggressively seduced by the middle-aged priest by her magical earrings, she cured a beautiful topless family friend from the curse of a vampire by lavishing her with kisses and after she gave the earrings to her mother as a gift, her mother very passionately kissed the baby faced maiden.

Unlike a number of films, the dark haired nymphet is this film wasn't played by an older actress, despite her multiple (non-sexual) topless scenes, Jaroslava Schallerov was 13 when Valerie and Her Week of Wonders was filmed. (Coincidentally, the age of consent in the Czech Republic is 15.)

Interestingly, this film is considered one of the outstanding achievements of Czech new-wave cinema.

This film is based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valerie-And-Her-Week-Of-Wonders/dp/808626419X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valerie And Her Week Of Wonders</a>&nbsp;that was written by Vtzslav Nezval, an avant-garde Czech writer and co-founder of the Surrealist movement in Czechoslovakia.",1395532800,2,1660,6.364444444444445
1969008,5,B00013D48G,"Oh, for the days when films like this were made! It's a ripe visual feast, soaked in rich color & symbolism, plunging headlong into the psyche of a young girl on the cusp of discovering & exploring her sexuality & its sweet tangle of confused, intense emotions. It captures the shifting nature of dreams as few films ever have, with a wonderfully disjointed narrative that skips & leaps & turns in on itself at every opportunity ... and yet it all makes sense on a deeply visceral level, if you only stop trying to pin it down intellectually & simply let it wash over you with its flood of incredible images. There's plenty of time to discuss & argue & analyze after it's over, and you begin to re-enter the everyday waking world. It's quite deliberately over the top with delicious black humor, doing justice to its source material. Add to that the darkly magical score, and this surreal confection is complete -- if not to everyone's taste, as some will find it incomprehensible & self-indulgent, to say the least. But if you're willing to surrender to it & follow it downstream, you'll be in for a memorable & moving experience. Most highly recommended!",1337472000,6,1156,4.671568627450981
1969009,3,B00013D48G,"3*s because I managed to sit through the whole movie in 1 sitting.

From the point of view of someone who has no idea what makes a movie 'good' or 'bad':

It felt like watching a 20s movie with 70s technology, colour and sound, although since all the dialogue is subtitled, it felt like watching a silent movie with a music score. Also the imagery is very 70s soft-core porn, vampire movie like.

The conversations make no real sense - at first I thought that this might be partially due to the inaccurate translation, but I guess they don't make sense in their original language either.

Loads of visually interesting images filmed on a low-budget. Each scene appears to be an individual mini-story, with little connection between them.

I do see the other reviewers connection to Company of Wolves. A movie that I did like.",1286150400,,825,4.662068965517242

Someone finally mentioned the title & I immediately ordered it. I read a review on a different site that described the movie as erotically confusing. I totally agree. I was mesmerized the entire time but I did find a few scenes confusing that made no sense, but maybe that's the point. I ordered the book so maybe I'll get some insight.",1277769600,,601,4.234782608695652

1969012,4,B00013D48G,"The title of my review sums up my feelings for this movie. I checked it out from my local library on a day when I was feeling up to a strange foreign film. I have to admit that if I hadn't been in the mood to watch it I would not have liked it at all. A warning to anyone who wants to see this film- if you do not like strange arthouse flicks or if you are not ready to think during an entire film, you will not like this film. You will also not like it if you are at all squeamish about taboo subjects, especially those in the sexual vein.

The film surrounds a young girl named Valerie who prior to her first menstruation has had a seemingly normal life. After that first ruby red drop of blood lands on a meadow flower though... strange things begin to happen. The world of sexuality opens up to the young girl as does a world of supernatural happenings.

This film was one that stuck in my memory for quite a while afterwards. I have to admit that I was a bit squeamish at times due to some of the subject matter such as pedophilia (Valerie is a mere 13 years), incest (her grandmother, father & supposed brother all have an interest in her) & rape. Yet at the same time those elements are an integral part in the story. The real meat of the film lies in Valerie discovering sex and her sexuality for the first time in her life. Things that were previously benign now take on different contexts. The cinematography is also worth mentioning- the film is incredibly beautiful visually with all sorts of wonderful imagery. Some of the imagery is lovely yet some of it is also grotesque looking, giving the suggestion that not all life is beautiful- some parts of it can get very ugly. I could go on about all of the allegories & subtexts in the film, but this is a review- not an essay paper!

Again, if you aren't a fan of the strange ""make you think"" arthouse flicks, you are better off staying away from this one. If you don't mind the strange films or if you are simply a fan of films where the cinematography takes your breath away, you want to watch this film.",1245628800,5,2067,4.227848101265823
1969013,3,B00013D48G,"Well after watching V.A.H.W.O.W. I came out scratching my head???
This is a very well made film and has some fine directing but BABY
throw plot right out the window!  We follow the very young but not
naive Valerie in her dream like world through out the film and we the viewer see incest,infacticide and witchcraft.  I really cannot explain
this film but say if you love Terry Gilliam and David Lynch than this is
for you. There is some horrific moments in this film like the priest with the NOSFERATU like teeth but this is more Alice in Wonderland than Allison
in Nightmareland.  I may need to see this again but will be awhile for I have some catching up to do with some very dear friends.",1236556800,3,692,4.390625
1969014,4,B00013D48G,"When I read Nezval's 1930s novel, I was sure it would work well in a visual medium. The book didn't so much narrate a story as align images against each other, creating a series of vivid visual impressions. This movie captures that sense beautifully.

Like the book, this movie offers little in the way of linear story line. Instead, sequences of event show the effect that Valerie's emerging womanhood has on those around her, including men tempted by her young beauty and older women jealous of it. Wantons around her foretell the love life that she'll have some day, and other young beauties reflect her temptation back at her. But, under it all, vampiric beings and shapeshifters carry out rituals with inscrutable purpose.

Part of this movie's quirky charm comes from its low-budget effects, part comes from the fresh-faced Valerie. Another part comes from analogies to a very strange&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B0000CG8I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>, in which the girl seems more of a spectator to a world with an inner logic that escapes her. If you're willing to trade plot for mystery and magic in a movie, give this one a shot.

1969016,3,B00013D48G,"If you bought a 500 page book with pages missing here and there for a total of 75 pages, you probably would have a hard time following the story.  That seemed to be the case with the U.S. version of this movie.  I am now set up to be able to watch movies from any region whether NTSC or PAL, and this is one of the first ones I bought from Amazon UK.  They listed an 85 minute version; when I ordered it, I received a copy with a different cover and it was only 73 minutes.  [The NY Times Movie database also lists the movie at 85 minutes.]  If this ratio was accurate, that means that nearly 15% of the movie had been cut to make the 73 minute version.  The longest I can find anyone else showing the movie is 77 minutes, and that from several different sources, which would make the U.S. version a version with about 5% cut out.  When Amazon UK checked into it further, they found that the 85 minute DVD listing was in error, and without my asking, refunded my money.

Both my wife and I noticed several times when there were obvious cuts in 'Valorie,' such as where two lines of subtitles were on the screen less than 1/2 second.  Cutting movies for the U.S. market is fairly common with European movies.  The most massive cuts I've seen so far are with 'Crusade: A March Through Time' where the Netherlands version is 138 minutes, the German version is 125 minutes and the U.S. version is only 100 minutes!

My best judgment now is that 'Valorie' in its theatrical run was 85 minutes.  Since it was a movie from a Communist country, Czechoslovakia, it wasn't preserved in a proper manner for the twenty-plus years it would take for the country to be freed.  Therefore, when it was able to be made into VHS or DVDs, eight minutes were too far deterioted to be used.  Four more mintues were questionable, and might have been used in some versions.  This was pared down, because of questionable quality, to make the 73 minute DVD that now seems to be the final version.  Therefore, it would seem reasonable that many viewers would find the movie chopped up and confusing since it appears that about 15% has been lost from the theatrical version.

To comment on the movie itself, I would say that if you are a person who remembers your dreams and likes to think about them when awake, you'll find this movie familiar material, and you'll probably like it.  If you don't remember your dreams, or ignore them because they seem so nonsensical, you probably won't like the movie.

I might add one more thought.  If you order regularly from Amazon.com, you should have no trouble ordering movies from their U.K branch.  In fact, I live less than 120 miles from Amazon.com world headquarters and I received the DVDs from England faster than from the U.S. Amazon!  Just remember if you do order from Europe you need to be able to watch Region 2 DVDs.",1201564800,12,2843,4.4373795761079
1969017,3,B00013D48G,"Note: Czech with English subtitles.

I would like to make two things perfectly clear at the beginning of this review. First of all, I do not claim to understand this film. Secondly, I will make no attempt whatsoever to explain the storyline. Well, maybe just a little.

The '70 film from the Czech Republic `Valerie and Her Week of Wonders' which was written and directed by Jaromil Jires is quite possibly the strangest, most  incomprehensible film I've ever watched. It consists of a most unlikely mixture of nostalagic musical interludes displaying childhood memories of purity and innocence; a white room where the sound of a music box adored with a spinning ballerina fills the room, beautiful, blossoming flowers adorn the pathway outside the house where just beyond a brightly colored forests of amber leaves dominate the landscape.

However childhood is coming to an end for the absolutely enchanting Valerie (Jaroslava Shallerova), the process of becoming a woman has begun during a brief stroll in the yard. Now the veil of navete has been lifted from her eyes and visions of another kind now begin to appear and beckon in stark and horrifying juxtaposition to the world she used to know. Depraved priests and vampire-like missionaries compete for her affections while overzealous flagellants pursue the young man of her desire. To further confuse and entice poor Valerie, an intermittent band of blonde haired muses in peasant dresses roam the forest exchanging amorous embraces soon awaken a strange fascination within her.

`Valerie and Her Week of Wonders' is visually stunning to the point of intoxication, yet totally incoherent in storyline. While the viewer is transfixed by the presence of the lovely Jaroslava one is left to feel captive to an onslaught of vampirism, voyeurism, sadomasochism, lesbianism and depravity. Truly the most voyeuristic film I've ever watched. This one is definitely for a very select, artistically oriented audience, file it away in your DVD case next to Fellini's `Satyricon'.",1184371200,14,2025,5.199386503067485
1969018,5,B00013D48G,"Man, get a clue you people!  This so-called ""anti-catholic"" film was released in the 1970s (during a period of intense social repression in Czechoslovakia) not because it was too ""weird"" for the censors, but because the original writer of the novel, Vitezslav Nezval, was one of the most celebrated communist poets of the 20th century.  He was an upper ranking bureaucrat in the Ministry of Information during the Communist seizure of power in 1948, and in the 1950s became the personal secretary of Vaclav Kopecky, the most powerful (and feared) communist in Stalinist Czechoslovakia.  Why do you assume that a good piece of artwork from a communist country must necessarily be anti-communist, or that artwork made by communists must necessarily be garbage propaganda?  Get a history book.  At any rate this has nothing to do with the film itself, which was released under a brutal political regime in the 1970s, and just happens to be excellent.",1174521600,14,947,5.044871794871795
1969019,3,B00013D48G,"This 1970 film from Czechoslovakia is a surrealistic movie that deals with a teenage girl bizarre dreams after reaching puberty. The film is certainly imaginative, has very strong visuals, is submerged in lovely central European folklore and is shot in luscious color. But what bothered me a little was something else: the constant mockery of the Catholic Church. Here one must say that the Catholic Church was not the most oppressive institution in Czechoslovakia in 1970. Rather, this was the time of the communist repression after the breakup of the Prague Spring. So, in light of this, these shots against a potential enemy of the communist regime seem a bit politically opportunistic, and gives a somewhat bad taste to an otherwise fine film.",1170115200,4,747,5.08130081300813
1969020,4,B00013D48G,"I suppose ""Valerie"" (1970) was a belated product of the Czech New Wave but it comes after the Prague Spring / Russian invasion. It was probably too surreal for the commissars & censors to bother with. In the West it became a cult favourite in the days when people smoked illicit substances at late night screenings in indie cinemas.

Valerie is the young heroine, she has her first period but fortunately she's got these magic ear-rings, however everyone in her rustic village seems to be lusting with nature or turning into vampires. Well, I hope that makes the plot clear. It must be something to do with that favourite 60s theme: ""a young girl's sexual awakening."" It's quite effective in conjuring a sense of anxious adolescent reverie in which everything familiar becomes erotic or strange.

The film is structured by extreme montage, which is all over the place & makes Nic Roeg look moderate. It's beautifully shot and extremely picturesque. The movie is being marketed as a cult item once more. I can't imagine fans of Eurotica or horror finding much of interest in ""Valerie"". However the excellent British pop band Broadcast did base their ""Ha Ha Sound"" album around this film, so it clearly does appeal to some contemporary cult music/film fans.",1150156800,6,1255,4.887323943661972
1969021,5,B00013D48G,"Closely inspired in the nightmarish novel of czech poet and writer Vitezlav Nezval, which in its turn is inspired in Gothic imaginary and fairy tales, this surreal symbolic vampire fable directed with fine irony by Jaromil Jires ( "" The joke "", adaptation to the big screen of Kundera's novel ) narrates the bizarre adventures of a innocent bourgeois teenage girl during the week she begins to puberty, surrounded in a succesion of sexual fantasies ruled by a vampire named Tchor from whom obscure influence gets to flee with the help of her magic earrings in an oniric journey in which Lewis Carroll and the Marquis de Sade could perfectly be her travelling partners. The movie is filmed in a subtle narrative way that reminds Fellini's films from the 60's ( for instance: "" Giulietta degli spiriti "", "" Fellini- Satyricon "" ) where the frontier between dreams and "" reality "" vanishes. The way that the director chooses to conduct the film and its context allows to read the bizarre world and erotic symbolism that surrounds to the protagonist as a subjectivetion of a familiar and represive setting that suddenly becomes strange to her innocent and anxious eyes by the effect of her sexual awakening. Shot after the russian invasion to Prague the film contains also a melancholy political allegory about the unfair situation in which lived most of the czech citizens during the years of the dictatorship.",1120176000,32,1407,4.891213389121339

It is this: not to identify one's self with any of the figures or powers experienced.""
  - Joseph Campbell

One of the great films of the 20th century, and unavailable for the last 30 years. A real shame (thank you Facets for its release! And such a beautiful print). I remember seeing ""Valerie"" for the first time in 1974. I had no idea what was going on, But it was one of the most beautiful films I'd ever seen, so I relaxed and watched the flow of images. I've seen it many times since (thanks to a bootleg copy).

The key to its understanding is that she is asleep from the start of the film to the end, and what we are seeing are her dreams, a unique approach to say the least.  A good analysis of the film can be found on pages 229-236, The Czechoslovak New Wave by Peter Hames, U. of California Press, 1985.

The end of ""Valerie"" is, to me, profoundly touching. During most of the film, she freely interacts with the characters of her dreams, but by the end she has achieved a kind of detached enlightenment; though they call to her, Valerie refuses to interact with them anymore. And so at the end, in that Autumnal landscape, as her dreams dance around her, she climbs into her bed one last time......Sleep tight sweet Valerie, don't let the bedbugs bite.....""Fear is only a dream / so dream little one dream.""

A note to Mr. Nietzsche (not the philosopher); the term is not ""Claymation"", that word was invented by the animator Will Vinton to promote his work. The correct term is ""Stop-motion"".
A note to Mr. Cox: ""La Femme Nikita"" is neither ""odd-ball"" nor a ""classic"".

Finally, regarding the remarkably unkind reviews of ""Valerie"" by the above 2 persons,
I'll let uncle Will have the last word: ""You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things....""

1969023,1,B00013D48G,"Having lived in the Czech Republic for much of the 1990s and developed a keen appreciation for that tiny country's rich  literary and film traditions, I was very disappointed in this film, which I saw mainly because a Czech friend told me that the screenwriter is a famous 19th century Czech writer.

Instead what I got was a hopelessly cheesy, self-indulgent and asinine movie that could've been made by some high school students with bad video equipment and a small-town costume shop.  Where to start?  This film attempts to be poetic and surreal but is mostly asinine and flaky.  It kind of flops along from one scene to the next with all the narrative force of a wet noodle.  It just about screams, ""They made me in the 1970s, that's why I'm so terminally corny!""  About the only way anybody could really enjoy this movie would be if they had a lot in common with the main character, a flaky (albeit somewhat cute) pubescent girl with the feeble, naive and passive qualities of a post-lobotomy 5 year old.

Please don't write off Czech cinema if this is the first Czech film you've ever seen.
