8175598,2,B000BGQULQ,This documentary was a disappointment. It didn't meet my expectations. I was also expecting an analysis about Malcolm X's life and some of his major speeches. This documentary didn't provide that.,1409702400,,196,5.354838709677419
8175599,1,B000BGQULQ,I was extremely disappointed after watching this DVD.  It is only about 15 minutes long and just flew through his life.  It didn't give very much info about Malcolm X at all. There has got to be better documentaries about Malcolm X out there.  Don't waste your money on this one.,1184198400,16,279,4.431372549019608
8175600,2,B000BGQULQ,"This dvd biography only scratches a small surface to Malcolm X. This dvd is recommended for the amateur to the person, to the cause, to the movement. I would recommend this dvd ONLY if you have never had any exposure to Malcolm X. It's only about 30 minutes in length. It gives a poor description of Malcolm X. It does not show any footage that you can't see for free at the public library. It is overpriced and probably not worth spending the enormous retail suggested price.",1147392000,38,476,4.482758620689655
