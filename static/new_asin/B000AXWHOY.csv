2395332,5,B000AXWHOY,"My girl Meg has done it again!  This dvd she kicks butt!!  It is the perfect dvd because it will make u bust a sweat, that's right I said bust a sweat, you are using weights and balls and bands and burning calories by toning and sculpting and there is such a wide variety of ways to target your special needs over and over and over.  It is worth buying!",1133308800,8,353,4.014285714285714
2395333,5,B000AXWHOY,"Meghan has a clear precise instruction which I found very refreshing when compared to Denise Austin and her annoying voice.  The workouts are infinite and quite challenging, which surprised me.  Navigating was simple, although I had to get my son to help out, leave it to the younger folks to figure out all the tech stuff.

Bottom line you get the most from your money.",1133222400,6,370,4.661538461538462
2395334,5,B000AXWHOY,"I am skeptical of many at home workout DVDs, but not anymore after buying this good ol boy.  Meghan is great instructor, great awareness, knowledge and understanding translates to challenging workouts.  Whether their was express workouts or the full blast, I love em all and seems like I will be using this one for a while.",1132531200,7,323,4.75
2395335,5,B000AXWHOY,"I was happy with this purchase and what the DVD offered.  Several different programs to chose from with separate times intervals from 15 minutes to over 60 minutes.  The workouts were kick-ass from the onset and I built up a sweat rather easily.  Ive only used a few of the workouts and the good thing is it will take me while to progress to the other programs.

Defintely for those individuals looking for a flexible, no nonsense approach to fitness.",1132012800,15,451,4.6
2395336,5,B000AXWHOY,"This DVD offers more then 20 workouts and conveniently breaks them down into workouts under 15 minutes and workout over 15 minutes.  (The over 15 range up to about 35 minutes).  I'm hooked on the short ones, especially the abs, glutes and legs all with hand weights, and the abs and back with the ring.  Very effective and easy to fit into my busy evenings.

These are basic Pilates moves (like The 100, roll-up, double leg circles, leg kicks, spine stretch forward, the saw, teaser, etc.) with what some are now calling ""standing pilates"" that are basically focussed side and back leg kicks, and also a sprinkling of some basic tried and true squats.  Adding in wieghts, the ring or a stability ball make the moves much harder then they look and give quick results!  You don't need to go out and buy all the props. I've got a ring, hand weights and a stability ball and there's plenty here for me to do.  There is some mat work without props as well.  But this is ""sculpt & tone"" so it does leave out some of the gentler moves in the traditional mat routine sequence.

This program is a great addition to my regular Pilates and Cardio workouts.  The Under 15 min sections work especially well on my cardio days or to fit in for a quick fix on busier days.",1131926400,23,1256,4.3982683982683985
2395337,5,B000AXWHOY,"I've been using Meghan's ""Ultimate Body"" program and love it.  I've done Pilates for several years and was very excited to see this DVD.  Pilates has evolved and has taken on lots of different forms and expressions in recent years.  The basis of Pilates is core conditioning and whatever individual interpretations have sprouted up, the basics seem to still be there - a strong core will give you a strong body and let you better perform other activities.  This DVD is more of a Pilates hybrid, so don't start knocking it if you're a purist.  Meghan takes some basic Pilates moves and some Pilates inspired moves too, and adds in light hand weights, the ring, stability ball and weighted balls to focus on specific body parts and combos of parts.  There are also mat work routines and ones that are part mat and part prop.  I haven't counted, but it seems that there are more then just 15 routines.  It's broken into a selection of under 15 minute and over 15 minute routines.  And then further by props used and sections of the body.

So far I've only done about 5 of the routines and combined two of the ones using weights, and I did the abs with the ring and did the upper body strength session from Ultimate Body. I will also incorparte some of these workouts into my regular Pilates sessions for variety.  I would say that beginners will find lots that they can do, but intermediate and low advanced should try it as well.  Every routine I've done so far was much more challenging to actual do then I thought it would be when I watched it first.

I've just ordered Pilates Complete for Everyone from the same company. That should round out my options and keep me going through the winter!",1129593600,12,1693,4.511475409836065
2395338,5,B000AXWHOY,"I just picked up this DVD and absolutely love it!  There are multiple workouts and so far I've found the core exercises to be very challenging leaving my stomach sore.  The legs, arms, and chest feel like they are getting toned already.  I have a toddler, so the express workout on the DVD is perfect for when I cant get in a full workout. Highly reccomend.",1128902400,7,357,4.378787878787879
2395349,5,B000AXWHOY,"If you have done Pilates before, then this DVD is something you should look at.  Meghan takes the time to remind you of things to keep in mind as you practice that help with form and also gives you some modifications to make it easier along the way, and expands on Pilates by making it work you more in terms of repetitions in some places.

There are sections that are geared to target many parts of your body and have other things included to really help tone areas, including the arms.  I have noticed the difference rather quickly when I used this consistently.  I had to buy another copy when my friend borrowed this and really enjoyed it.",1277337600,,643,4.423728813559322
2395350,5,B000AXWHOY,"I bought 3 DVD's on pilates and yoga from Amazon, but this is I the one I now use daily. Amazing change in my life! I am 62, almost 63. I've suffered from backpain (off and on) most of my life.  Then a new problem developed with my knee (prognosis was bursitis). I got these dvd's because slowly but surely I was becoming unable to do much, even walk at times. Now I ""do"" morning pilates (using this dvd) EVERY morning, WITHOUT FAIL. Since I've started I am much more limber, no back pain or knee pain, and haven't seen a chiropractor since I've started. I notice the change in just the simple process of putting on my shoes! Karen (the instructor) leads you through simple warm-ups, then exercises, that prepare you step-by-step. Although I have had trouble (at times) starting my exercises, I immediately remind myself of the days before pilates, and off I go.  Since I'm now more active, I have also found it easier to lose weight, using some dieting and increased exercise. At my last 'weigh-in' I had lost 21 lbs., and I KNOW these exercises were key to that. I'll use these exercises the rest of my life, they are that important!",1271203200,2,1135,4.478260869565218
2395351,5,B000AXWHOY,"Very good bunch of routines based on Pilates poses which help target parts of your body that you want to work on, and combinations of the same.

Just Abs, just Arms, working combinations of various parts of your body, there are many combinations to get focused workouts of various times.

Includes some things with and without various Pilates props such as rings and weights.

If you like Pilate workouts and want some Pilates that also is targeted, a nice addition.",1249948800,,466,4.8
2395352,5,B000AXWHOY,"I've had had balance ball for about a year.  I got the ball after hearing how great it was for ""core work.""  Never found much to do with it until these routines.  I watched them before trying them.  Don't be fooled, they are harder then they look.  I love it.  Kicks it up a notch.  I like routines that I can do but not just breeze through.

The straight /more traditional pilates portions are also very good, about 1/2 the material has some sort of props such as weights or balls, while 1/2 can be done without anything but a mat/workout area.  Good selection of material which targets areas and also provides a general workout.",1239321600,,630,4.408695652173913
2395353,5,B000AXWHOY,"Pretty much every routine on the DVD will require that you stabilize your core by engaging your abs.  Even the routines that aren't labeled ""abs"" will give you some ab benefits.

This program would be suitable for new and more regular exercisers.  No Pilates experiences needed.  If you're new stick to the mat workouts.  If you want more of a challenge then do the workouts with props.",1237507200,,386,4.701492537313433
2395354,5,B000AXWHOY,"There's a nice variety of workouts on this DVD ranging from about 10 minutes to a half hour.  You can choose from mat workouts, or workouts with hand weights, the circle, a weighted ball or a stability ball.  If you want a traditional Pilates workout this is probably not the DVD for you.  If you like Pilates moves and want short workouts based on Pilates then you'll like it",1235952000,,376,4.420289855072464
2395355,5,B000AXWHOY,"I started doing Pilates about a year ago with a couple of DVDs and wanted some more Pilates workouts so I picked this DVD up.  If you have any Pilates experience then this is a good selection.  Even if without Pilates experience you can probably catch on (there are some small sections of instruction and a basic routine to work from.)

The  DVD is easy to work with with selections broken down into two main catagories - 15 minutes or less or over 15 minutes, so you  can easily make a selection based on whether you feel up for a longer workout or need to run out the door quickly and just want to squeeze a workout in.

In each of these sections there are a variety of routines, some which are just Mat workouts (including a good modified Mat workout if you are newer to Pilates.  If you are new, start with this one and watch the lessons) and some that add weights, weighted ball and more.

The wide selection and variety makes a very enjoyable DVD which I am getting alot of use from.",1230854400,,989,4.279569892473118
2395356,4,B000AXWHOY,"I started doing pilates in a community college class this summer. I found it hard to keep it up after the class ended and so decided to get this DVD. Overall, it's pretty good. I've only done mat workouts on it and will update when I try the others.
The exercises for mat workouts are pretty good. It has some exercises we didn't cover in my class and leaves out a bunch, but you can't have everything jam packed in there right? You can mix and match your workout or do an extra long one by doing a bunch of workouts available in the dvd.
Megan White, or whoever the lady is, is calm while being enthusiastic without going overboard. She does go a bit too fast sometimes, so don't hesitate to hit the pause button. Better to do it right and do it slow than strained yourself.
As for the level, I think it's best for people who have tried pilates already, even though she does have an introduction section for the exercises.

I'd recommend this item",1219881600,,948,4.325842696629214
2395357,4,B000AXWHOY,"This is the best Pilates DVD I've tried. Although, the instructor is a little too happy at times, I really do enjoy her workout method. It is clear and easy to follow. You really ""feel the burn"" once you're done with this one. Plus, it has many workouts on this one DVD to let you pick and choose what area of your body you want to focus on.",1212278400,,341,4.029411764705882
2395358,5,B000AXWHOY,"This is a great dvd!  I'm not sure I'd recommend it if you're just starting pilates for the first time because it's more oriented toward an intermediate level and new moves are explained quickly, but for everyone else I would say it's a must have.  I love how much variety the dvd gives.  I probably use about a quarter or a third of the workouts, and I still never have to do the same workout twice in one week.  There are modifications to make the exercises easier or harder, and Megan White is very upbeat and keeps a good pace.  I've been doing pilates for a few years, but I have a hard time getting to classes because of my schedule and I was getting really tired of my old routines.  Now I'm looking forward to working out again!",1206748800,,736,4.258992805755396
2395375,5,B000AXWHOY,"I have been using the Body Wisdom Media DVD's for a couple of years, and I can say this is by far the best one.  The variety of workouts is great: there are routines under and over 15 minutes- if I'm pressed for time I can at least get something in most days.  The use of props- weights, balance ball, pilates ring, and weighted ball keep the routines interesting as there's enough variety to do something different every day of the week.  Lastly, I thought I was actually getting pretty strong and developing great core strength until I started using this DVD.  I was sore for 2 days after my first 30 minute workout with weights.  On the plus side, my running has improved since doing this DVD.  I would highly recommend it- even if you don't like exercise videos!",1203897600,,766,4.435714285714286
2395376,4,B000AXWHOY,"I was looking over some old reviews that I have written and I see I made a mistake on this one.  The comments that I made referred to another pilates DVD that I had purchased around the same time.  I do like this DVD very much and still use it often.  And I believe that every routine on this one does have a cool down, although it's the same for every routine.  I'm so sorry if I mislead anyone.  Sorry Meaghan!",1202428800,3,412,4.037037037037037
2395377,5,B000AXWHOY,"Easy to watch. Easy to listen to. The tone of the DVD is great. Lots of short and longer routines. Variety of accessories (weights, balls, mat etc)are used which keeps tedium at bay. I highly recommend this DVD. I found it at my local library. Great way to try different DVDs prior to purchasing. It's a pleasure to be instructed by someone who isn't all dolled up and annoying. Yeah Meghan.",1189296000,,391,4.52112676056338
2395378,4,B000AXWHOY,"Pilates Complete Sculpt and Tone is an offering from Body Wisdom Media which makes full use of DVD technology to provide a wide variety of workout options.  Here, shorter Pilates segments are mixed and matched to form complete routines of varying lengths, from just under 10 minutes to 30 minutes or more.  Workouts can also be selected based on body part (eg, abs, arms & legs) or use of various equipment, including weights, a fitness ring (aka Pilates circle), a stability ball, and a small weighted ball (medicine ball).

These are definitely intermediate level workouts.  Although Meghan offers good form pointers as well as modifications, she does not provide the level of instruction needed for those new to Pilates, so some prior familiarity with the exercises is a must.  In addition, she often performs a higher number of repetitions than what is usually seen with Pilates, making the exercises more challenging.  Furthermore, if you do some of the longer routines (eg, the abs with all the equipment), you will be repeating some exercises (eg, the hundred), so you will definitely feel the moves pretty intensely.  On the other hand, I was a bit disappointed that Meghan did not include some of the higher-level Pilates exercises such as the rollover and the neck pull; despite the large number of routines, the exercises were fairly similar across modalities.  I also thought that the sequencing of moves was a bit odd at times, as Meghan does not follow the traditional Pilates matwork progression.  Finally, I would have preferred to have the DVD allow me to do my own mixing and matching rather than to provide me with the premixed options (although I did appreciate that there were an extensive selection of these).

Overall, this DVD is probably best suited to someone who is an advanced beginner to intermediate in Pilates, enjoys working with a variety of Pilates equipment, and is looking for variety of workouts of varying lengths.",1171929600,14,7115,5.140138408304498
2395379,5,B000AXWHOY,"I've done both pilates classes and pilates dvd's at home. The real truth is nothing is as good as a class...ever. But this dvd is the best I have used because of its diversity.

The problem with dvd's is that no matter how many you have you are always doing the same thing, same mat exercises, same amount of time (one half hour).

Also most dvd's are made for all fitness levels and so if you are intermediate/advanced you have to sit there and wait for the instructer to outline every move before doing it. I work out early morning and I'd nod off more often then not while the instructor is instructing me on how to breath correctly.

This is why this dvd is great: weights, mat, balance ball, ring, weighted ball, it devides each of these into 10 minute workouts for different areas like abs, glutes, legs, arms. You choose where your focus will be, how long you workout, mix it up or work on you backside for a half hour, the choice is yours. Plus its made for people who already know how to breath, correctly, positioning, what ""body box and pelvic floor"" are ect.

I was in a major rut because no matter what dvd I bought, it did exactly what the last one did and was no longer than a half hour. Now I can workout as long as I want on what I want. I love it.",1171238400,3,1265,4.193415637860082
2395380,5,B000AXWHOY,"Meghan White is one of the best dvd instructors out there.  She moves you through the workouts so that even though it's burning, and you're sweating, you hear her count ""for 4, 3, 2, 1..."", and you know you've made it.  She's positive and really gets you moving.

I started out with the under 15 minute exercises, and I've now moved to the 30 minute one.

The one alteration I would do for people with hip bursitis, or back problems, is when you go forward, with your legs ""hip width apart"", in one of the usual pilates exercises, I always stretch my legs out in a V, with legs wide on opposite sides, and that will help people with back or hip bursitis problems.  It releases the back and the psoas muscles.

As far as the overall, this is great!  I love it.  Right now I've been doing the 30 minute Mat exercises and I sweat hard where drips fall off of me!  And though currently it's hard for me to do the push ups in that part of it, I will keep trying!

Meghan White is the best!",1154908800,4,984,4.158730158730159
2395381,5,B000AXWHOY,"The paper I read (Argus Leader)  ran an article where they had fitness experts review DVDs in various categories and whether they were ""Worth The Workout"".  This DVD was highly rated across all categories

-There a good ""burn""

-it was not boring,

- a beginner could do it, yet parts that were challenging enough for experts

- that the instructor was very good, professional and knew what she was doing

- the experts would use the DVD again.)

Anyway I picked up all four DVDs (there were recommendations in the general category of Cardio, Toning, Pilates and Yoga) and so far am extremely happy with all of the titles they recommended.

The first workout I did nearly killed me, but I keep going back for more and my body is getting use to the workout, but there are many routines which I have yet to try.  Here is to happy workouts and a smaller waist!",1137456000,5,387,4.422535211267606
2395392,5,B000AXWHOY,"I too am skeptical of workout videos, however this is the absolute best that I have ever tried.  While most only offer 30 minutes of one routine, this dvd allows you to mix and match however you like.  I was absolutely shocked to see so many options in the menu when I popped the dvd in for the first time.  The Pilates aspect is great too - not just the structure of the dvd.  I take the one Pilates class offered at my gym once a week and this is a great supplement.  She hits all of the moves and is great to talk you through it and remind you of form.  I definitely recommend it.",1137110400,6,583,3.9827586206896552
2395393,5,B000AXWHOY,"DVD comes with such a variety of workouts which totally blew me away.  The instructor Meghan was so precise and detail, every program whether the full workout or shot express 10 minutes worked every muscle, I was in such pain, and I consider myself a intermediate exerciser.  If you want variety and results along with Pilates then this one is for you.",1135900800,7,352,4.661290322580645
2395394,5,B000AXWHOY,"I was looking for a relaxing stretching video. I love Pilates and thought I would give this a try. Meghan really knows how to go slow BUT work every muscle. I thought it would be easy but it really challengs me. I also love how I can pick my own routines.

I do something different each time and work different muscles all week long. I could feel and see a change in my posture and form after a few days.",1134000000,10,404,4.05
8080185,5,B000AXWHOY,I have many different workouts but this DVD is my all-time favorite.  I really see the results and I love that it has customizable workouts.  I  had this disc for about two years and I lost it a few months ago but I love it so much that I had to re-order it because I couldn't get along without it.,1455062400,,298,3.933333333333333
8080186,5,B000AXWHOY,"Love this DVD - really awesome variety of workouts that can be picked and chosen.  Workouts included for weights, ring, weighted ball, and fitness ball.  Instructor is clear and not irritating.",1414972800,,193,5.193548387096774
8080187,3,B000AXWHOY,Not as good for me.,1407974400,,19,3.0
8080188,5,B000AXWHOY,This is dvd is great!  It has a wide variety of workouts.  It is pretty tough to get bored !!,1395705600,,93,3.6
8080189,5,B000AXWHOY,This is the best Pilates sculpting and toning DVD I have found so far.  And the BEST thing about it -- NO VOICE OVER.  You feel like you are in the class with the instructor.  The work out is challenging enough for me.  The different options keep it fresh. I have been doing it for almost a year now.  I have tried to find others but they just keep falling short of this one.,1354665600,,375,4.013513513513513
8080190,5,B000AXWHOY,"I have not exercised in years, and this DVD is excellent to get you back in exercise mode.  Easy to follow.  I purchased a pilates ring, weights, balls, etc. so I can mix up the exercises each day.  Even if you don't have the energy to exercise, you can follow these routines.  Don't get me wrong, I can feel my muscles burning.  Done right, this will tone you up quickly.",1321833600,,372,4.257142857142857
8080191,5,B000AXWHOY,"adjust ur TV screen, cuz all but color is perfect!!!

intro, education, multiple workouts, contact info, other products: it can all be skipped or viewed whenever u want to!

Only improvement I can think of is to have prop and mat combo workout for individual props just like they do at my gym.
example:
* magic circle & mat.
* large ball & mat.

The ""less than 15-min."" workouts use each prop throughout. or just mat throughout.

The ""more than 15-min."" workouts use all of the props, repeating some of the less than 15 min's. and has a cool down at the end of each workout.

further, it notes how long each workout is so you can manage your own time.",1321401600,,651,4.347107438016529
8080192,5,B000AXWHOY,"A nice addition to my regular rotation of home workouts.  There are routines that focus on just one body area, routines with weights, and other props, and longer, full body workouts.  Great for adding some core workout into your fitness routine",1293062400,,244,4.926829268292683
8080193,5,B000AXWHOY,This is a excellent Cd with a lot of variety .  You will see results if you use this cd faithfully. The only one down side I found Megan White's voice is annoying if you can get pass that you will LOVE this CD!,1291680000,,210,3.772727272727273
8080194,5,B000AXWHOY,"This really works well to get you into shape.  It is a nice mixture of various pilates exercises brokwn down into workouts that are 15 minutes or less and over 15 minutes.  There is a wide range of workout combinations using variouss items, mat, weights, large ball, small ball, ring.  There is a short pilates lesson, and also a modified pilates flow workout, to get you started with pilates to some degree, though it is more of a workout DVD than a strict ""how to"" do pilates DVD. But working with the lessons and modified workout a few times worked out fine for me to get ready for the rest of the DVD.  Definately a great set of workouts.  If you are totally new to pilates you may want a beginners DVD to start or supplement this DVD, but you will want this DVD later on for what it gives you.",1285200000,,798,4.258278145695364
