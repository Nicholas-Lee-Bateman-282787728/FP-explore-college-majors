Bullhorn led to a very interesting conversation.

In some ways I think one of the biggest seductions in American Christianity--besides the temptation to become complacent in our vast wealth and prosperity--is to become an ""issue-driven"" person. Politicians of both stripes have prostituted the gospel in the name of values and morality. To be driven by one single point of behavior misses the entire point of God coming to be with us and calling us to be his.

We came up against some of this in conversation.

Before I get into the conversation we had, let me say this: I have yet to find anyone, outside of the whack-job radio host who made a response video to Bullhorn, who really believes that the Bullhorn guy's tactics are legitimate in the context of the 21st century. Yet, when you start asking people what they are doing (both personally and in the larger sphere of things) to change the negative perception that Christianity now carries, people get clearly uncomfortable.

And to some extent, it is understandable that some would take the path of argument rather than action.

It is the path of least resistance.

So...in our conversation we talked through some of these things as a group. And, as I expected, some brought up some ""issues"" that mean a lot to them.

Again--it is easier to take a stand for a nebulous issue than to follow Christ with your entire life. And I think that is a temptation for some even in my group. And I know these guys: they are trying to give their lives to follow God.

All in all, I felt Bullhorn was very useful as a small group tool. It exposed some areas where people might be more concerned with issues that have been sold to them as important by false shepherds than with living out and expressing the love of Christ. This was not an easy conversation.

My hope for this conversation going forward is that we will be able to ""throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles."" And that each of us will ""run with perseverance the race marked out for us.""

I love my guys. They need the freedom that only the unconditional love and leading of Christ brings.

For those of you who are small group leaders: I recommend Bullhorn very highly. Just be ready when it comes time to talk through it.",1192060800,,2450,4.568493150684931
