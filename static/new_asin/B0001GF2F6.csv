1998881,5,B0001GF2F6,"I ordered Showtime years ago so I could watch Stargate. And once they sold it to Sci-Fi Channel, I wondered if I should cancel Showtime and save some money. When Dead Like Me came out, I was damn happy I hadn't. If there was anything I would have changed with the first season, it would have been more episodes.
Dead Like Me is one of those shows that's well writen, well acted, funny, irreverant, thought provoking, and just a rollicking good time. MGM and Showtime have a another hit on their hands. I hope they keep up the good work and I can't wait for season two.",1078876800,3,568,4.317757009345795
1998882,5,B0001GF2F6,well im not reviewing the dvd itself as much as the first season. this is probablly the best new show ive seen in a llllllloooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggg time!!! im glad to see it was recognized and will be returning. anyway back to the season. its smart funny and all around good. i think youll especially like it if you like shows such as buffy the vampire slayer and angel. i hope you give it a shot because its well worth the money,1077494400,2,440,4.5125
1998883,5,B0001GF2F6,"July 2007 Update!!!!!!  There is going to be a movie!  Shooting has either wrapped up or is close to wrapping up.  Star Ellen Muth goes so far as to hint that that a renewal of the series might be possible.  Details are still forthcoming and apart from the movie (and I'm sorry, I don't know if this is a TV, a direct-to-DVD, or theatrical release) nothing definite is known about the chances of the series being revived, but this is definitely good news.  There is some recasting.  Mandy Patinkin, unfortunately, will not be back as Rube nor will Laura Harris as Daisy.  It appears Rube's character is being replaced by a new head reaper, while a new actress will be playing Daisy.  Otherwise all the other actors will be back.  The rest of my review now appears as it was first written back in February 2004.

I would place DEAD LIKE ME on the shortest of short lists of the truly great television shows of the past decade and a half (that date referring to the debut of TWIN PEAKS and a more artistically serious form of television).  Most television shows are unambitious affairs, either because of constraints from the networks or lack of creative talent at the top, but DEAD LIKE ME stands head and shoulders above the competition.  It is not nearly as well as it deserves, primarily because it was a series that appeared on Showtime, which limited its exposure.

The television show begins--we learn later--with a toilet seat from the MIR space station rushing to fulfill its destiny on planet earth, namely to ignite into a ball of fire and strike eighteen-year-old Georgia ""George"" Lass, who is taking her lunch break on the first day of her temp assignment with the Happy Times Employment Agency.  George looks up at the descending ball, inaudibly utters the word ""sh#t"" and immediately enters the next stage of her existence, if not her life.  Much to her astonishment, she finds herself standing a few feet away from her body, able to see the living, but herself unseen by all except for a few Grim Reapers, whose job it is to see her into her afterlife.  Usually this involves aiding them to the place where they will spend eternity, but in George's case, she is recruited very much against her will to become a Grim Reaper.  The rest of the first season deals with George's deep resistance to accepting her new vocation, as well as coming to terms with her death, the loss of her family and the discovery of what they unexpectedly meant to her, her need to find a living (it turns out being a Reaper is an unpaid position), her yearning for friends and companionship, and her growing awareness of what it means to be a human being.

The show succeeds on virtually every level.  The scripts are consistently superb, many of them by series creator and STAR TREK: VOYAGER alum Bryan Fuller.  The production values are far beyond the normal television series.  The special effects (and there are more than one would expect on a show of this kind) are always striking.  The photography is simply unmatched in television.  I might be inclined to defend the statement that this is the show has the best photography in the history of television.  The camerawork is difficult to praise too highly, with innovative camera angles, zooms, wide angle lenses, and especially filters to make this an incredibly beautiful show to look at.  It was filmed in Vancouver, but it was supposed to be Seattle, but instead of the rain that one anticipates from the climate, there is constant and brilliant sunshine.  Green dominates the screen (the color of growing things?) in every exterior shot.  It is exhilarating to view a series that is made this well.

The cast is exquisite.  Ellen Muth plays George, and I'm not sure they could have gotten anyone more perfect to play the role.  She is a perfect blend of sullen, grumpy, vulnerable, and lost, and she manages perfectly to communicate her awakening to life by having died.  She is also one of the more interesting actresses to have appeared in sometime, giving the appearance of being average in appearance while in fact being a striking beauty.  Her undead supervisor Rube is played by the great Mandy Patinkin, and he turns in his usual exquisite performance.  Rebecca Gayheart (who was the original Inara on FIREFLY, but left before the pilot was shot) was superb in the first few episodes as Betty, who was replaced in the team by Laura Harris (of ""24"") as deceased Hollywood bit player and promiscuous party girl Daisy Adair (who continually regales the group with tales of her sexual conquests of movie stars).  Perhaps my favorite moment of the season occurs when the Reapers are forced to catalog and record all the last thoughts of those whose souls they have reaped, and we inadvertently learn Daisy's last thought.  She immediately moves from being an unsympathetic character to one that we love more than a little.  The hard-as-nails Roxy, who works as a meter maid, is played convincingly by Jasmine Guy (of A DIFFERENT WORLD, and the team is rounded out by Callum Blue as the hapless British thief and druggie Mason.  Cynthia Stevenson is great as George's mom.  Special mention has to be made of the supporting character who provides perhaps more hysterical moments during the season than any other, Christine Willes, who plays the unforgettable Dolores Herbig ""Brown Eyes,"" George's supervisor at Happy Times, sometimes friend, and host of her own website called ""Getting Things Done,"" on which she is seen whenever she is home ""getting things done.""

After loving the first season of the show, I was tremendously excited about two things:  1) the DVD set coming out and 2) the second season.  I was ecstatic when the show was renewed for a second season.  Despite its quality, Showtime has not worked at developing original series as has its rival HBO.  But last fall they announced the show had been renewed for 2004.  The new episodes should begin appearing in May 2004.  I heartily urge anyone who loves great TV like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, SIX FEET UNDER, and FIREFLY to give this remarkable series a shot.  You won't be disappointed.",1076803200,273,6107,4.756885090218423

1998885,5,B0001GF2F6,"Meet George.  Your typical 18 year-old recent High School Graduate that doesn't know what she wants to do with her life, but knows that College isn't part of it.  So after her mothers persistance she takes a job as a file clerk, only to die on her first day by having a toliet seat from out-space hit her on the head.
When George Wakes up she finds out that fate has chosen her as a Grim-Reaper.  She must help people to the afterlife, until her time comes to go on herself.  It might take 2 weeks, it might take 200 years to get to whereever she's suppose to go, but shes doing a job that she has to do.
Over the course of the first season George meets many very interesting ""Grim Reapers"" including: Mason, your typical out-for-a-buck reaper, Betty the fashionable reaper, Daisy the once movie ""star"" that blew everybody from John Wayne to Luke Perry, and Rube the leader of the pack.
The Story also follows the effects of George's death on her family, that she thought never liked her only to realize that she was the backbone that held them together.
Now collected for the first time is the complete first season of the showtime series.  This is a great series, and desearves to be seen by everyone that likes the bizarre, yet comedic that don't have showtime.  Or for fans that want to watch this great season again.
Highly Recomened.",1076198400,14,1339,4.467213114754099
1998886,5,B0001GF2F6,"The first season of Showtime's very popular series, Dead Like Me follows George from her death, by the re-entry of a toilet seat off of MIR, through her transformation into a reaper.
One of the best parts of the series is all the ways they find to ""off"" the people who die in the show, from a canoe flying off a car, toilet seat burning up on re-entry and nailing them in the town square or a dead guy falling off a balcony and landing on a newly-wed couple, it's always different and darkly humorous.
All is not fun and games, as George is also trying to find herself, being a typical ""Gen X Slacker"", her life really didn't start until she died.",1075939200,8,647,4.2682926829268295

1998922,1,B0001GF2F6,"It's difficult to sit through the first episode, I gave up on the series. It's squarely in the head thoughts of a complete loser that makes everyone else's lives miserable, and full of judgment and laziness to fill the constant stream of thought. I suppose it's a 'realistic' look at the way the world is, in an entitled main character cares about nothing. I'm sure there's growth potential for this character, but I just kept waiting for the promised death by toilet, when I realized that she would probably linger on like this for at least one more episode.

It has an ensemble cast, with standout performances by Ellen Muth, Mandy Patinkin, Callum Blue, Cynthia Stevenson, and Jasmine Guy.  Supporting actors are standouts as well.  I think what I truly like best about this program, is the evolution of Ellen Muth's character, Georgia Lass.  Great programs aren't just about what happens, but what happens to the people involved.  Truly, great TV, and something I've watched multiple times.",1476489600,,559,5.155555555555556
1998963,5,B0001GF2F6,"I was so lost when they only did 2 Seasons, loved Whitly I forgot her real name. Just a good movie, about how most ppl do not believe in The Reaper, that is one of God's angels,",1476403200,,177,3.810810810810811
1998964,5,B0001GF2F6,I loved the first 5 episodes but when the new girl Daisy showed up I didn't really care for her character. I loved how Georgia's character grew. Loved the last 2 episodes of the first season. Didn't like the second season.,1476403200,,222,4.439024390243903

1998970,5,B0001GF2F6,"How can grim reapers be charming? How can anyone laugh at death? What the heck are gravelings? Watch this quirky, humorous, sometimes touching series to find out. It was not what I expected at all: it was MUCH better. Yes, some of it is corny. But you will forgive it because of its other redeeming qualities. Light viewing with a wisp of philosophy and several prat falls, including one involving a banana peel. Try it---you'll like it.",1476230400,,437,4.688311688311688
1998971,5,B0001GF2F6,"starts out slow but it grows on you.  very novel concept for TV.  acting is really good.  You get some drama, a lot of humor, and things to think on.  My only complaint is it ended too soon.",1476230400,,190,3.9210526315789473

1998975,4,B0001GF2F6,This is a cute little show for adults. The language they use is not for kids. The concept of Grim Reapers taking souls and the funny stories involved along with the chemistry of the main characters make this a good show. Too bad it's only one season.,1476230400,,250,4.340425531914893
1998976,3,B0001GF2F6,"This short-lived Showtime comedy garnered high ratings on IMDB so I decided to watch it.  I was disappointed.  While the concept of ordinary-looking grim reapers walking among us is clever, it failed to execute.  It is marketed as a comedy, but it is not funny enough to warrant that label and it also fails as a drama.  That puts it, unwittingly, in the dreaded comedy-drama or ""dramedy"" category.  This middling show lived short for a reason.  It is just not that good.",1476144000,,471,4.682926829268292

1999260,2,B0001GF2F6,"You might think, because of the young cast, this is suitable for teens.  It's not.  Even though there is no nudity, the phrases ""$10 blow job"" and ""hard nipples"" are bandied about as if they are nothing.  The same is true of the profanity (taking Jesus' Name to be nothing more than a trivial exclamation).

I am shocked to see the high reviews.  Putting the language and coarse material aside, it was not really funny; it did not provide any insight into death or suffering (although it tried to insert a thought now and again, which came off as pretty lame).

Whereas, in many series, it is easy to buy into all of the assumptions and setup; I had a lot of trouble with the set up here.  They looked and acted just like regular people (although they appeared differently to their relatives); and much of the time, they had to find living quarters where their dead had previously lived.  And, many of them had to have real jobs in order live.  In other words, these people who are dead and have the supernatural job of taking the souls of soon-to-be-dead folks, even though much of the show became about them living semi-normal day-to-day lives handing out traffic tickets.

1999287,4,B0001GF2F6,"If you're at all familiar with Showtime's little-known, cult hit series, ""Dead Like Me,"" you will know that its fans lament its cancellation after a mere two seasons. It is indeed unfortunate that we never had the chance to spend more time in this weird, wonderful, and quirky world. Yet I feel this even more strongly than others do; to me, this series had its soul removed long before it died - to be precise, after Episode 7, shortly following the departure of series creator, Brian Fuller, after episode 5.

For those who are unaware, Fuller left the show due to ""creative differences"" with the network. Although it's difficult to say exactly what the extent of the conflict was, we know that it revolved in part around Showtime's refusal to keep actress Rebecca Gayheart on board. Gayheart had previously been involved in an automobile incident where she received manslaughter charges. Because of this, Showtime didn't think it was good for their image to have her playing a grim reaper. Her character, Betty Rhomer, was written off and replaced with the somewhat annoying and overbearing Daisy Adair.

Following the simultaneous departure of Fuller and Gayheart, we still are treated to a couple of great episodes. ( I suspect the studio was running on Fuller's leftover ideas). Yet by the time we've reached Episode 8, the quality has certainly dropped a notch. It's easy to ignore this; after all, the writing has the same spark, even if the swearing becomes a little too profuse. Yet the attention to the story and the characters, and a sense of true genius, just isn't there.

""Dead Like Me"" was initially the story of a girl called George Lass who is completely indifferent to life, but begins to appreciate life's curiosities after she is killed and becomes a Grim Reaper. However, after the first few episodes, character development suddenly and almost completely grinds to a halt. George's original character arc is dropped and never resurfaces. Her intellectual awakening and determination to go against the system disappears. Despite the occasional offhand complaint, she begins to seem more or less contented with her position as a Reaper. Viewers might interpret this as a natural character progression, and indeed it makes sense that she could have finally sunk into passive acceptance of her role. Yet it is completely unfitting, because the whole initial point of the series was supposed to be George's ironic post-death awakening to the world around her, and how she broke out of her blind acceptance of the status quo.

Meanwhile, the plot veers off into a series of individual side-stories that don't seem to reflect George's character growth. Although initially the episodes were well-focused and clearly displayed a personal journey, eventually it becomes often difficult to see what connection exists, if any, between the different threads of an episode, which don't seem to meet at the end, plot-wise, but sometimes not even thematically.

Meanwhile, we are given scene after scene of George's family, while never seeming to learn very much new about them. In Episode 9, we do get a somewhat closer look at her father Clancy, but it isn't exactly what Fuller intended (which I will explain later), and it doesn't touch on the reasons for his shaky relationship with his wife Joy. George's sister Reggie, and Joy exhibit plenty of room for further exploration. Yet we witness scene after scene of the family's stilted interactions, while never actually learning anything about why they act the way they do.

The willingness to take risks disappears. For the first few episodes, the show is edgier and more irreverent. Until suddenly it becomes almost... normal. The apparently critical remarks about religion disappear, despite that they were so central to the show that the opening scene of the pilot was a cheeky revision of the creation story, based on ""Frog and Toad"". The instances of blood and gore, something which should be expected in a show about death, vanish as well. The sense of boundless creativity is lost, because the hilarious, clever Rube-Goldberg like situations leading to the deaths suddenly stop. While it was initially impossible to predict how any person would die, suddenly the answer starts to seem perfectly obvious. (A milk man gets run over by a milk truck - how is that for lame?)

There is one instance in which the show does return to its risky nature. However, it comes across as tasteless and sanctimonious political pontificating, rather than a message that has been thoughtfully and properly buried in the script. It is the episode ""The Shallow End"", with the transgender woman.

We have clues as to how amazing this show could have been. In an interview, Fuller dropped some explanations as to where the story would have gone had he remained in charge. One of the most significant differences would have been the revelation that George's father was gay, meaning that since he was not supposed to procreate, her life was not meant to exist, causing her to value it even more. Instead, the studio decided to play things safe. There are still hints of Clancy's homosexuality, such as in the pilot episode (""Is a friendly hug between two men supposed to last that long?""). Fuller also mentioned that Betty would have returned to take George on a ""mission"" to ""storm the castle"". Whatever that means, I'm sure it would have been more interesting than the collection of mostly forgettable side journeys which the show devolves into.

It's another case of a studio sanitizing and damaging a property because they fail to see what viewers really need. This started off as a daring and highly creative series, something like the next ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", except more extraordinary. Then it dwindled down into a bunch of fun but slightly phoned-in episodes. It just should have been better. I can't help but think that the real reason the show is so well-loved is really because of its beginning.

And by the way, if you want a decent finale, watch the movie that concludes the series, Life After Death. It was made without involvement from Showtime and finally addresses a lot of dropped plot threads. While far from perfect, it's a much better send-off than the network gave it.

Don't take any of my complaining to mean that I didn't enjoy Dead Like Me. Even at its worst, it's better than most of television.",1463011200,8,6374,4.947663551401869

1999312,5,B0001GF2F6,"Dead Like Me boasts some of the most sympathetic flawed characters in the history of cable television. Terse, acerbic, and heartbreakingly funny narration from George Lass holds together a death mythology that is as logical and unbiased as it is ridiculous.

I'm starting my third watch of this series, and I love it as much as I did when I watched it in real time. The cast is perfect. Ellen Muth could give a master class in eye-rolling, and Cynthia Stevenson, who is always at least excellent, absolutely outdoes herself as Joy. Lass. And that's just the tip of the absurd and ironic iceberg. Jasmine Guy and Mandy Patinkin (""Rube"" - perhaps a nod to the manner in which death often occurs) are outstanding.

This is a good companion series to Six Feet Under (they were on different premium cable channels during the same decade), but it is also well worth watching on its own merits.",1462233600,2,887,4.67948717948718

network support there was a multi multi season potential. Plenty of story/plot lines to expand upon like other popular shows . This happens frequently with the sheer volume of programs that TV burns thru.",1461801600,,490,4.395604395604396

Cynical, bleak, sarcastic, smart, and observant.  While she does make some young follies, it is interesting to see her accept and grow into a role that was thrust upon her.

I was a little hesitant about my ability to relate to an 18-year-old primary character, but the rest of the cast sold me.  I'm sure I am outside the normal demographic for this show, but ""Dead Like Me"" has something for just about everyone. It is so much better than I expected, and I'm picky.  I watched the first season in about a week and was more impressed with it each episode.  There is a lot of humor, yes, but also a lot of depth and heart.

Each week souls are ""reaped"" and people die.  This show is somewhat like passing an accident on the highway.  Once you start an episode you're compelled to watch to see what happens.

1999769,2,B0001GF2F6,"To be fair, I only watched one episode.  The premise is intriguing, what if you were commissioned to spend the afterlife ushering other souls to their future state?  The execution is wearying.  I am guessing that perhaps the primary focal point was to watch this oblivious young woman gain an appreciation for life, but I didn't care.  The characters were flat and lifeless, the storyline, slow to unfold with nothing to beckon me forward.  The laws regarding afterlife behavior were so random, it was clear that they were irrelevant, so there was no tension there either.

I changed it from one star to two, simply because this program, unlike Jessica Jones which I attempted to watch, didn't present the main character's futility in such vulgar and demeaning ways.  Jessica is also living an empty life, punctuated by meaningless sexual encounters and expletives that are bunched together so closely, they carry no weight whatsoever.

But otherwise, they share a common thread.  Life is meaningless, and in this particular case, so is the afterlife.",1453248000,,1051,5.063953488372093

1999795,5,B0001GF2F6,"This is a wonderful show.  Dark humor at its best.  Brilliantly filmed and written with a great set of actors.  I just wish it had lasted more than a couple of seasons.  It just goes to show that, time and again, something great gets on TV and is underappreciated.

Dead Like Me is the story of George (Georgia), an 18 year old girl who doesn't know who she is or what she wants, doesn't get along with her mother and ignores her sister.  She dropped out of college and now her mother is pushing her to get up, get a job, and get out of the house.  George is sullen, angry, and not interested in doing much of anything.  But she heads out to a temp agency, gets a job filing, only to end up dead on her first day.  This is where the story really begins, as George is drawn into the world of ""Grim Reapers,"" and finds she has to take people's souls before they die.  She works with Rube (brilliantly portrayed) and a group of strange other Reapers, Betty, Mason, and Roxy.  She struggles to understand her death, her loss of a life before having really lived it, and acts out against her situation...realizing that the consequences of her actions (or lack of) is larger than she could have imagined.

At the same time, her mother, Joy, and her sister, Reggie, struggle on in their loss of George and with each other.  All the while, George keeps going back to the house (she has a different face to the living) because she can't quite let go.  She also finds a new family with her Reapers, as well as the folks at Happy Time temp agency.  George learns more about what it is to be alive after death than she ever did in her life before...and this series takes us along with her.

Best bits are the Reapers hanging out in the Waffle House, the wry witty banter between them, and Rube taking on the role of ""father"" to this poor, lost girl who finds herself among the ranks of the Undead.  This show really makes you think at times...

Great series...highly recommended.  Has some occasional blood and bad language, so not for little kids.",1449446400,,2036,4.352785145888594

1999893,3,B0001GF2F6,"As with many series, this starts out with an interesting, tongue-in-cheek, opening.  The writing is brisk and the story is basically, ""lucking out"" to become a grim reaper, a step ladder effect to reaching whatever else is out there after you die.  So in a sense, you get a glimpse of the future (in knowing your victims, as a grim reaper should) but not too much beyond that.  So you have to rob your victims (if you can) to make ends meet since you're stuck on earth but without a real (paying) job.  And the first episode is cute, but before long devolves into silly and soon, you are hoping for a grim reaper program director to arrive and say, ""really??""  But the characters fit, even if the story starts lagging a bit (how many grim reaper tales can you make after pianos fall and people slip on banana peels?).  Overall, a nice change for an hour or so; but beyond that, it might be worth checking something else out, like ""Tomorrowland"" or ""Saving Hope.""",1445558400,,962,4.468571428571429

The series is about life as seen through the eyes of one young person after her untimely death. Although she becomes a reaper and takes the souls of the soon to be departed, she starts to realize how much she missed in life and what she had lost.

I'm glad I did; the characters seem a bit wooden at first, but most really develop over time. I have a hard time picking a favorite: Rube, the father figure of the group; Roxy, the tough-as-nails authoritarian figure; Mason, the friendly ""big brother"" character; or Daisy, the actress with the heart of gold (and maybe a little material desire).

And that's the main character Georgia for you , to be honest I think I really felt I related to her , because really to me she just seemed to no more about what she didn't want in life than what she actually did. Which most people do but, typically most people settle with it  while , people like Georgia would rather....die (sorry couldn't help myself) and really I think that's the real story for the gang of reapers in this tale. I like to think that the theme of this humorous tale is that life sucks for everybody but, that doesn't mean you should just give up . And of course it's another little clever gem of Bryan Fuller, whose other works you should defiantly check out, that like most good things in television is cut too soon because of TV's main desire of better ratings and not for better shows.",1437609600,,998,4.360215053763441

Still have no idea why they cancel shows like this and Firefly, yet continue to copy the same drab shows over and over. If you enjoy this show you'll probably also enjoy a show called Wonderfalls.

The viewer is introduced to the story through the angst of a young woman (George) who has been thrown into the role of a grim reaper after her death. Grim Reapers, are a group of dead people who liberate the soul from the body of the soon to die. Georgia the title character ""reaper"" is taught the ropes of her new role by fellow Reapers. All played magnificently by other actors.

Ellen Muth's character is wonderfully refreshing as being a rebellious young person and she plays those dead-panned looks perfect.
I will watch season two. I normally enjoy drama and sci-fi but it's refreshing to be a bit lighthearted sometimes. The only other comedies I follow are The Big Bang Theory and Two Broke Girls.

She's just an angstey underachieving teenage college drop out who gets hit on the head and is now a dead, angstey underachieving college dropout. Even the allure of Mandy Patinkin and a hot Brit guy couldn't keep my interest. If I'd felt motivated to stick with it, I would have watched her character develop and blossom. The rest of the ensemble, and this is an ensemble show, also warms to their characters, and by the end of the first season, I couldn't wait to watch the second, and sadly, last season. They manage to tie up a few ends, and I hear there's a movie of it, but DEAD LIKE ME should have had a long run on TV. Give it a chance and binge watch Season One.

Laying hidden in the dialogue, scenes, and situations are some philosophical ideas that a person can wrap up in their thoughts.  We know that everything on this planet dies; it manifests into a physical state of existence and will eventually move on.  This show depicts a point of view that most often is over looked.

2000286,5,B0001GF2F6,"I'm a big fan of any story about dead people reflecting on their lives.  Though Georgia isn't maybe the most likable person, I can identify with her.  She was someone in life who didn't do much because she felt it was pointless, but then she dies and regrets all the lost opportunities.  We watch her family struggle with her death.  Through flashbacks, we see how she became the person she was.

Then there are George's lovable co-workers--both her fellow reapers and her day job.  I was upset to see the curly hair red-head leave.  I didn't really like her replacement at first, but Daisy grew on me.  It ended kind of on a heavy note that goes into Season 2, but I did like it.  I think the show deals more with George's anger at dying so young at the end, so it gets a little more intense then.",1427414400,,798,4.302013422818792

One thing it does well is to follow the dead girl's family in the years after her death as well as following her in her new undead role. It takes a while for the cast to really jell, nearly half the first season, but it does, and i have found this to be a pleasure to see again.",1425945600,,439,4.419753086419753

2000356,5,B0001GF2F6,This show is truly a 5-star series. All of the characters grow on you as you learn more about them. Each episode has a theme of sorts. The show is not depressing at all. It makes light of difficult situations that are out of people's control. Its hilarious at times. I loved the writing and the cast is epic. It does have a similar narration style and sarcastic / irrelevant attitude to other shows. You can just marathon every show in the series even though there isn't much suspense. The background characters like her family becomes a big part of the show and I'm glad they made it fit. This show just worked on multiple levels.

I SOOO wish this show had gone into more seasons!!!  (That said, the movie that was made from it a few years later, that does not have Patinkin in it, is not worth the time to watch it, IMO.

2000562,4,B0001GF2F6,"The series is hard to get into.  The character development is such that initially you like none of the principal people.  But, as I got into it, it reminded me of the character development in Northern Exposure.  The principal protagonist grows as she learns life lessons (albeit after death).  Mandy Patinkin is great as sort of a Greek chorus (much like Chris in the Morning in Northern Exposure).  I must admit, if I hadn't had time on my hands, I might not have made the effort to watch past the first two episodes.  It was a major surprise to begin to hear the kind of philosophical musings from Mandy that I had so enjoyed in Northern Exposure.  After that revelation, I began to give the series more of a chance and I'm glad that I did.  Each of the characters develop into people about whom you actually care.  The are some real laugh out loud moments as well.  Give it a chance.",1415318400,,886,4.41358024691358

2000602,2,B0001GF2F6,"When Dead Like Me came out, I liked it so much that I set aside time to watch it every week.

The first episode was great.  The concept was promising. The casting seemed perfect. It's still hard to imagine anyone else playing the lead character, the slacker reaper, George.

As the weeks passed, problems became apparent.  There were interesting elements in every episode, but other elements that  dragged the show down.  It's odd that the writers couldn't see the problems, because viewers could, and bailed on the show in large numbers as a result.

What worked about the series were the relationships among the ""undeads,"" particularly George and Rube. The actor playing Rube brought an intensity that was the perfect counterbalance to George's apathy.  The revelations in the final episodes about his character and his family, particularly his daughter, were nicely crafted and beautifully acted.

What ruined Dead Like Me were the seemingly endless interludes dwelling on George's family.  In a typical episode, we might see George's mother argue with her sister about what to wear or what to have for dinner; watch George's mother be caustic and nasty to her father; watch George's father look morose and wander off; watch George's mother sell her house; watch George's sister steal toilet seats and deny that she was stealing them; watch George's sister make lunch; watch George's sister try on makeup for the first time; watch George's sister stop using makeup; watch George's mother have an affair; watch George's father have an affair; watch George's mother and sister move into a new house; watch the family's dog get sick; watch the family's dog get hit by a car; etc., etc., etc. Most of this had little if anything to do with the episode's main story arc. It became a tedious kind of filler, truly difficult after a while to keep watching.

It's one thing for the characters to be trapped in an endless kind of purgatory; it's another thing to ask the audience to endure it, week after week, when it's clear that it's pointless and going nowhere.  Audiences bailed, and I'd say this was the reason.  So Dead Like Me died young, like its protagonist. So it goes.",1411948800,5,2174,4.875

2000609,4,B0001GF2F6,A quirky tale on the afterlife that's taken from the perspective of an unappreciative angst-driven teen.

2000611,5,B0001GF2F6,"I am a Bryan Fuller fan who has enjoyed Wonderfalls, Pushing Daisys and it all started with Dead Like Me.  IMHO, this was his best.  The fact it was cable meant it wasn't restricted and had an amazing cast.  Ellen Muth provided a strong character as Georgia the newest Undead.  George was funny, indifferent, strong and vulnerable as the lead.  Jasmine Guy, Callum Blue, Manny Patinkin and Cythina Stevenson were amazing as the cast. The story revolves around George death and adjusting to her life as a working member of the Undead.

Season 1 is almost perfect.  This is one show that deserves to to be in production again.",1411084800,,624,4.669724770642202

It's truly a classic in the sense that even when you hoped you had forgotten the series--you think about it anyway and you want to see it again. This makes it a ""cult favorite"" forever--and in this sense, it has that look and feel all the way.

On the subject of reality, at times it seems either a little too real or a little too fantastic. You're forced to go back and forth between the two; it's difficult to come up with a final decision.  It's also a bit on the depressing side, which can weigh heavy on your soul, but that's eye-opening all on its own, isn't it?",1408233600,,708,4.268656716417911

The premise is that some people who die are selected as ""reapers"" who collect the souls of those about to pass away. The reapers are ""undead"" who have to work to earn money for food, clothing and shelter. They take with them into death the emotional issues of their lives which they may be able to resolve in their afterlife in some way. Of course, complications ensue. The undead are forbidden from contacting former family and friends. If they do, there are consequences.

I'd forgotten that it ever existed until I saw it available on Prime. Vaguely remembered watching a few episodes when it first aired and thought it might be fun to watch again. More like slow mental torture. No wonder Showtime cancelled it after two seasons; it deserved a visit from the grim reaper after season 1.  Badly written, badly acted, full of plot holes, and tedious beyond human endurance (mine, anyway).

But as an adult, I found myself skipping multiple episodes because the same things literally happened time and time again. The show didn't really have dynamic conflicts and the characters, well they remained the same. Which is fine for a comedy but for dramas people want to see growth or they want to be able to connect with the characters.

The main conflict and the only real continuous one, will George ever reveal herself to her family, is the only conflict that drags out for two season.

The one interesting part of season two only lasted two episodes and ended in a lack luster and anti climatic way. Since I did enjoy it as a teen and some episodes were funny and interesting even to this day, I'll give it three stars.

It sucks now with my seasoned eyes, I can see why it was canceled after two seasons.",1401753600,,1006,4.39247311827957

Maybe my imagination doesn't stretch as well as it used to so I'll not say anything bad about this show. The acting is okay but the whole idea just doesn't get it for me. My suggestion?

Then a voice says to me, 'This is going to take more than one night.

Sometimes I lie awake at night and I ask, ""Why me?"", then a voice [possibly Rube] answers ""Nothing personal, your name just happened to come up.

2000838,5,B0001GF2F6,"""Dead Like Me"" Season 1 is a breath of fresh air when it comes to television.  This quirky show has an outstanding cast of actors who make the premise of being a ""reaper"" believable.  Oh, what is a ""reaper?""  A reaper is one who has died but for some unknown reason, is still of this earth,( although he has  a different physical appearance from his previous life) and whose job is to assist the soul of the soon to be dead.  Ellen Muth is wonderful as ""George"", an uninspired slacker who gets killed by a hurling toilet seat from a space station reentering the atmosphere.  Her boss is Rube, the talented Mandy Patinkin, uses post-it notes to hand out the assignments to the small group of reapers who meet daily at a German themed Waffle House.  It sounds strange but this odd little gem of a show  had me hooked and looking forward to the next episode.  The stories can be funny and poignant, yet each one made me ponder the importance of living life to the fullest and showing appreciation to the people in your life.  The only tragedy of this show is that it only lasted for 2 seasons.",1391558400,,1090,4.378109452736318

2000860,4,B0001GF2F6,I generally like Mandy Patinkin.  He takes unusual roles and really makes them work.  The plot of a young and rebellious teen being thrust into a role that has responsibility and from which she cannot escape creates interesting scenarios.

Ellen Muth plays George, a pitch-perfect disengaged girl who learns more about living after her death than she ever cared to while alive. Surrounding her are several other misfit refugees from the once-living, all lead by Rube, the immediate supervisor in their grim-reaping responsibilities, played by a relentlessly no-nonsense Mandy Patinkin. Parallel to their story lines, the series follows the splintering (and growth) of George's family along existing fault lines in the aftermath of her death.

Sharp writing and excellent acting make this an enjoyable and worthwhile series if you enjoy the premise. Just don't squint too closely at some of the ongoing plot details about the co-existence of the dead and undead.",1388793600,,869,5.297101449275362

2000878,4,B0001GF2F6,"Quirky, weird,and funny!  A very weird group of dead people charged with being ""Reapers"" go on assignments to collect the souls of folks marked for death.  They must carry on lives the same as the living only they no longer look like their old selves and have new identities.  This is the season premier which sets up the characters, their new lives with new problems, and their reaper assignments all in a dark humorous look at live and death.

The show centers around a group of formerly human, but now-dead reapers, tasked with releasing the souls of those about to depart this plane of existence. While the show is mostly drama, its also interspersed with a healthy dose of comedy. Never taking itself too seriously, its quirky characters and interesting story lines certainly offer another take on life and death. Jasmine Guy also stars.",1385596800,,484,5.05

As Grim Reapers, these guys are great. The rules for Grim Reapers are WILD.

I like all actors, characters and the premise.  It was very well executed.  I wish it would have stuck around a little.  I particularly like the protagonist Georgia, as played by Ellen Muth.  Not to diminish any of the other characters/actors.  It took them all to make Dead like Me entertaining.

It was witty and intelligent.  Very well written and very well acted.  I was sad to see that it was cancelled after only two seasons.  Evidently there was enough public interest for them to make a full length feature film.  Unfortunately for whatever reason they were not able to get all the original actors and that  made it less of a pleasure to see as the chemistry wasn't there.  Creator, Bryan Fuller is a genius.  He also brought us ""Pushing Daisies""  If you have seen that and liked it you will probably enjoy this as well and vice versa.",1372636800,,716,4.396946564885496
2000959,5,B0001GF2F6,"A family friend suggested this show a few years ago, and on a whim we actually decided to check it out. I absolutely love Dead Like Me. Everything about it is excellent. So much of it feels original. The plots are thick enough to be very interesting, but won't loose the viewer.",1372550400,,278,4.365384615384615
2000960,5,B0001GF2F6,"I did not know this show excisted until about 5 days ago.  A friend from work told me about it and lo and behold I found it on amazon prime.  I watched the first season in one day I spaced season two over the next two days and capped it off with the movie.  I loved the show and even though the movie was not as good as I would of liked, it still worked.  I just wish the show had kept on going.

the good:  the characters and their interactions with one another are what make this show a clasic.  George and Lil George were perfectly cast.  Mandy Patinkin what can I say his role as the Boss/father figure is one of the best performances i have seen from him.  There were times when I was watching this that I thought, I love this man I wish he was my dad.

I could say more but I don't to spoil it for anyone who has not watched it yet.  All I can say give a shot.",1372291200,,866,3.8361581920903953
2000961,5,B0001GF2F6,"Dead Like Me is just one of many examples of shows that were fantastic, but never received a big enough following while they were running to stay alive during the television run. Yet, after the show had been off the air, it began to spread by word of mouth and friends passing along DVDs and videos of the show, giving it the cult following it has today. Poor Bryan Fuller...between this, Pushing Daisies, and Wonderfalls, he has had one show after another cancelled long before its time. (sorry Heroes fans, the show got a little long in the tooth and lost its way to deserve more seasons)

The pacing and humor of the show are spot-on, and each character is well-developed and evolves as the show continues. George goes from having no direction in life to finding little things here and there to live for as she begins to find her way in the group. Rube, who is mysterious and guarded at first, begins to reveal pieces of himself that both satisfy and leave one wondering more about his past. Mason may seem a drug and love-obsessed fool at first, but shows that he notices more than it would seem, and actually has quite the sweet side. Roxy probably changes the least in the show, but builds relationships with the other characters that make her invaluable to the fabric of the show. Finally, Daisy makes huge strides through the show, going from a flippant harlot into a woman showing flashes of deeper loneliness and emotion. The rest of the Lass family rounds out the cast, but the stars are clearly the reaper gang.

Each reaping features a little bit of a lesson, revealing just a bit more about characters, the job of a reaper, the ""rules"" and more. It lends forward momentum to a show and keeps it from being formulaic. Indeed, Dead Like Me is anything but procedural. Some might be offended by the constant swearing throughout the show, but I think it grounds the language from becoming too philosophical and clever at times.

All in all, this is one of my favorite shows, and I still watch it every few years and remember just how brilliant it was.",1372291200,,2061,4.564864864864865

2000969,4,B0001GF2F6,"Dead Like Me was a quirky series about death & the afterlife.  Becoming a Grim Reaper after her death, she struggles with the concept of relieving souls shortly before death so they go to Heaven rather than be trapped in their dead body.  She has to get a job to support herself because she doesn't get paid for Reaping!
  The series predates a lot of the horror TV series involving vampires and the like.  I like the show because of the unique concept and acting.",1370995200,,464,4.411764705882353
2000970,4,B0001GF2F6,"Showing the daily lives of reapers, their preference of meeting in a local waffle house, and using sticky notes guiding them to their next targets creates a humorous show.

2000973,5,B0001GF2F6,"The writers of this series are obviously top notch.  The dialog was always clever, the plots are smart, the concept is brilliant the direction is superb and the ""soapiness"" level is just right. Because the script/directing is so good the acting is also superb; Ellen Muth and Mandy Patinkin make the show as does Cynthia Stevens and Britt McKillip.  Why on earth it got canned I'll never know, maybe some influential bible thumping republican shareholders at MGM got upset with the less than Christian take on ""life after death"".  Certainly if you're a religious nut this series is likely not going to work for you.  If you have an open, intelligent mind and want to escape into an interesting tongue-in-cheek world of new ideas and brilliant well written satire then this is well worth watching.",1370390400,,796,4.874074074074074
2000974,5,B0001GF2F6,"The premise is appealing:  someone, somewhere, knows when and where each of us will leave this life, and there will be another someone on hand to remove the soul from its body and escort it to ""the lights.""  Removing the soul prior to death allows the victim to escape pain and fear upon death.  It's a comforting concept.
So who removes these souls?  People who themselves have suffered mortal injuries, but who--for whatever reason--remain ""alive"" to reap the souls of those who will die.  We never know why these ""undead"" reapers weren't immediately ushered to their own ""lights.""
The show focuses on a small family of reapers, five in all, with a team leader (Mandy Patimkin) responsible for issuing each day's assignments--name, time, and place only.  It's up to the individual reaper to be there, on time.  So we see lots of folk leaving their lives in some interesting ways.  Their bodies are dead, but their spirit selves materialize immediately, so it's not at all gory.  Even the death scenes aren't gory--they remind one of the scene in ""Wizard of Oz,"" when we know that the wicked witch has met her fate by seeing her feet poking out from beneath the house.
The reapers, in between their daily reaping assignments, are expected to be self-supporting.  They work at jobs just like the rest of us.  They no longer look like their former selves, but they have retained all their lifetime memories.  The key character, an 18-year-old malcontented girl, has remained in her hometown and, despite her boss' repeated warnings, continues to check up on her real-life family (who, of course, cannot recognize her).  So we get to see how the death of one daughter is affecting the surviving family.
If you're wondering how this could be humorous, you'll simply have to look at an episode.  Black comedy, perhaps, but it's also often quite touching.
Oh, one of my favorite aspects: even animals have souls, and reapers have not forgotten them.",1369440000,,1944,4.851515151515152
2000975,5,B0001GF2F6,"The idea was fresh (at the time it was originally aired 2003) and done well.  The cast were believable in their roles and everyone fit their parts perfectly, especially ""George"" played by Ellen Muth, she is a joy to watch.  The writing was excellent!  It is fast paced, witty, thought provoking, and keeps the story going each episode from beginning to end always leaving you ready to click the next episode.  This might not be for some due the subject matter of the ""undead"", but for me, I was sorry there were only two seasons made!  (I saw the movie, but I wouldn't recommend it).  I've watched the seasons a couple of times now and I've started the series again with a friend.

2000979,2,B0001GF2F6,"My wife and I bought the first season based on the amazing number of five-star reviews here.  We definitely regret doing so.  We haven't found much of anything to enjoy so far in this first season--the scripts are derivative and repetitive, the dialogue is trivial and uninspired, and many of the situations are just simply silly--they require far too much suspension of disbelief in order to buy what's going on.  We both love the premise and hoped for more, but we didn't get it.  The feeling I get is that the makers are trying too hard with everything, including casting.  Nothing seems natural, and everything seems forced, with a ""this will work here"" feeling behind it all.

And while the main character seems to be created to be confused and overwhelmed, she comes across mostly as whiny--and her voice for the narrative voiceovers is simply ineffective.  And while I don't have any problem with vulgarity if it fits in the context of the show, here the curse words seem nothing more than gratuitous.  And much of what goes on seems contrived in order to create confusion that allows for plot twists, such as giving only the initials of the people who are going to die.  It's a contrivance that makes no sense at all, and that is also fairly insulting to a viewer's intelligence.  And the dead having bodies and having to eat and have jobs?  This is another contrivance that allows them to put the main character in a dead-end office job that is one of the most lifeless and boring settings that I've ever seen.

It's interesting for a couple of episodes, but our interest died out quickly, and we don't feel any desire at all to see the rest of the season.  We don't care about any of the characters, and we don't care about what will happen to them--it'll more than likely be more of the same.",1368316800,2,1803,4.579439252336448

The writing was witty and provocative (at least for the first season) and the acting was strong, particularly Ellen Muth as George and Cynthia Stevenson as her frustrated mother Joy.  Little touches (such as the perennial yodeling background music in Der Waffle Haus and the frequent use of the jenga tower as a metaphor for how intertwined we all are with each other) provided a rhythm and flow to ""Dead Like Me.""  It's fun to watch and at the same time it is sometimes painful to see George's family struggling in the wake of her death.  The bizarre ways in which people die are kind of amazing also.

2001020,5,B0001GF2F6,"So many duplicated cop TV shows, it's ridiculous!

I remember when this ""Dead Like Me"" show started airing on TV, I used to turn it off because I thought it was another girly drama TV show!  God no, I do I want anymore drama within my life.

After a couple of years, I came across this TV show again because nothing was on TV, and finally found out there was more to the show than some girls chatting!

If it were not for the blood and strong offensive language, this would be a great TV show for kids!

Pros:
Teaches morals and ethical values, with a twist
Reminiscent of Bible and Church related material, but not obvious

Cons:
Strong offensive Language
Some blood

I have watched most of these shows while aired on TV, but going back through them on Amazon for the shows I missed, including the very last one.  I believe I also bought the Movies.  And not to offend anybody, but Mr. Mandy Patinkin left for one of the more recent cop TV shows.  However, his show I found a little more unique than the others, as it dealt with psychological profiling and I would find this show really interesting versus the other cop shows.",1363219200,,1127,4.375

2001024,5,B0001GF2F6,"Bryan Fuller has an odd, often macabre sense of humor.  He also has a unique and interesting cadence to his dialog that is apparent here, although truly showcased in his later series, ""Pushing Daisies"".

In this wonderful series, the protagonist is a disaffected young woman who dies and becomes a grim reaper. But, she doesn't just die, she's killed by a toilet seat falling from a space station. Some of the souls taken by this new reaper die is spectacularly silly ways, and the reapers need to take the souls before the grim deed occurs. Of course, all of this, from the bizarre deaths to her nickname among reapers (Toilet-seat Girl), to having to earn a living and pay her own way even after she dies, adds to her sense that the world isn't fair. While she starts out focused on life's unfairness to her, she begins to become refocused on how life isn't fair to anyone. Her growth, as she learns true empathy for others and finally discovers the value of family, the macabre sense of humor, and Fuller's fascinating dialog provide a richly rewarding television experience.",1362441600,,1078,4.7287234042553195

The great thing about this show is you can just watch one episode, but its even better when you watch them all. It pieced together lots of little bits that I may have missed before.

Its basically about a girl, Georgia, who dies (she was hit by a toilet seat when a nuclear spacestation exploded) and she becomes a grim reaper. It follows her life as she struggles to come to terms with the afterlife. There is great humour in it, with a touch of the serious side of life.

The last episode was particularly touching for me when George realises that even pets have grim reapers.",1357257600,,816,4.3202614379084965

I watched both seasons 1 & 2 on Youtube, despite of the bad language, and I finished every single episode TWICE! In fact, I liked it so much this time that I bought the DVD set.

The acting is good and plots are interesting.  If the language was a bit less offensive I would give this 5 stars.

If you are not sure whether or not you want to keep a copy of the show, just go on Youtube to check it out.  Took me a while to finally buy my own copy but I definitely have no regret.",1347753600,,678,3.807142857142857

2001054,5,B0001GF2F6,"If you like dry, morbid humor, you will love DLM. This episode was particularly poignant. This is the first time we see the parents' marriage trajectory, and realize they were once a happy nuclear family living a very traditional life with apparent satisfaction. We see how that over time produces not only bitterness in their relationship, but depression and a generally negative outlook in their daughters.

We also get a deeper insight into Daisy, beyond her self-presentation to the world. And we see a new side of some of the other characters as well. ""Maybe we are all just temps,"" is the episode's key line. And in that realization of the ephemeral nature of our existence, within a context of recording the last thoughts of the dying ""for posterity,"" we find the essence of human life. We are here but a short while, and when we die it is hardly original, nor in the DLM universe is it generally very happy in the end. Every joy is fleeting. And even death is just another assignment. Yet we can be there for each other, surround ourselves with people we love, and that is the redeeming possibility.

Somehow they manage to make all that moroseness humorous and heartfelt. Great writing and great acting. This is my second time watching this series, and though it is more of a belly laugh the first time through, it never fails to entertain.",1344556800,,1349,4.687763713080169

  But what made the stories so interesting is, that while doing her job as a Reaper she actually learns about life and to appreciate what she might have had in hers .

2001077,5,B0001GF2F6,"Dead Like Me originally aired on Showtime from 2003-2004 however it was not until 2007 I first discovered this gem of a show. I still wonder how it took so long for me to ever hear about it. Coincidentally, it's much like Quantum Leap in that it is one of my favorite series ever (#1 actually) and it was all because of the Sci-Fi Channel and their marathons I became a fan.

Dead Like Me is a show that follows five main characters (one leaves after the fifth episode to be replaced by another) who just happen to be death--literally. The show's main focus is an 18 year old woman named George (short for Georgia) Lass who is killed in the first episode.

The way it works in-universe is that there are multiple grim reapers--though we never see THE Grim Reaper--around the world, many (or all...it's never explicitly said as we meet a few non-main character individual reapers) work in groups. These groups all work under a specific category. For example, one reaper in the second season takes the souls of people who die of natural causes. George and the other main characters work with the ""External Influence Division"" (murder, suicide, accident). In order to become a reaper, it's more or less the luck of the draw. To become one, the reap has to be the reaper's last one. In George's case, she was. Last reap's must take their reaper's place when said reaper moves on, or gets promoted as the show puts it.

One might wonder how someone like George can go about doing their thing if they are dead. Perhaps wondering, wouldn't someone, especially family, notice? Well, reapers often two appearances--their true appearance, and what the living world sees.

Dead Like Me is a character-driven plot. Very much so, dare I say. But that's no problem as the characters play off one another so well.

The main characters include George, an 18 year old college dropout with a twinge of misanthropy and social alienation (it's noted on the commentary that no one her own age is present at her funeral), Mason, a constant screw-up alcoholic drug user who died in the 1966 and this reviewer's favorite character, Roxy, a tough-as-nails meter-maid and later police officer, Betty who is replaced after five episodes by the seemingly self-absorbed and shallow actress Daisy Adair who died in the 1920s, and the leader of the pack, Rube, a complex father-figure to the group, and especially George. Wildly different people in terms of personality, but they all play off each other and interact to the point of it being almost amazing.

In the wake of George's death is her parents and younger sister who struggle to deal with it in their own ways. This is just to name a few though. There are other recurring characters as well you easily will love seeing on screen.

One of my favorite things about season one is watching George grow gradually going from an 18 year old who doesn't want the responsibility of being a reaper, trying her best to shirk her duty, and taking people's souls to accepting it and having no problems with doing what must be done.

And I believe overall that's what season one is about--George's journey and growth. The black humor, and surprisingly poignant moments peppered throughout, work well together also. It's not a show where one ruins the other, thankfully.

Though it's not a show everyone will like (just like everything else, we all have different opinions and tastes), would I recommend checking it out? That is a whole-hearted yes.",1299628800,,3463,4.758333333333334

He's been hounding me for years to rent this.
FOR YEARS RONALD!!!
Ahem...so years later I finally did rent season one...and...THANKS RON!!!
Very few tv series are any good.
Cheers.
The X Files.
Pushing Daisies.
I would consider those to be the few elite tv shows.
There are plenty of others but those are the first that come to my mind.
And...now I can add Dead Like Me to that list.
I can see this is from the same guy who gave us Pushing Daisies so I'm not really surprised I loved this show also.
So few tv shows just do everything right.
From the casting.
The music.
The pacing.
The stories.
The basic idea behind the series.
Throw in a decent amount of luck and some shows get a few of these points right.
Dead Like Me however gets EVERYTHING right.
Few shows can make me laugh, cry and think about life/death all within the space of a half hour but this one does.
Brilliant.
I wish I could name some stand out episodes but truthfully every episode is a stand out.
If you've never seen this series and have an appreciation for a show that's different, unique and not afraid to take chances than do yourself a favor and rent this.

Dead Like Me gets my highest recommendations.",1299283200,,1303,4.3884297520661155
2001079,1,B0001GF2F6,"I streamed this from Netflix, so it didn't cost anything, thank goodness.  In my opinion, the creators of this show have failed to create characters that I care about.  They are more like caricatures than real people.  The only people I really like in this show are the mom and the sister of George, and they aren't on enough to make the show worth watching.  6 feet Under was such a great show, as are many of the other pay TV shows.  This one just doesn't measure up to the usual calibre of cable shows I have become used to watching.  I like the actors in the show, except for the lead.  She reminds me of ""Skipper"" (as in Barbie's family).  She has no personality, or maybe her personality is just uninteresting to me.

2001080,5,B0001GF2F6,"I like many others began watching this series long after it was cancelled.  The show was not cancelled due to a lack of ratings, in fact it was doing very well for Showtime.  Budget problems with MGM and subsequent related issues spelled it's demise.  Few productions capture the audience in the way that Dead Like Me have, inspiring a league of devoted followers and fans, perhaps even cementing Ellen Muth as an icon of the intelligent sarcastic witty attractive grim reaper she played so well.  I highly recommend watching both seasons to completion, if possible in the order they were produced.  The dynamics and interaction between cast members was a treat, albeit one clearly targeting the adult audience due to the adult language and sometimes realistically harsh interactions between the group of reapers that is the subject of the series.  This series is not about death, it is about the facilitators who help people transition from life to death and how they deal with themselves while trying to exist and work in the real world amongst the living.

Dead Like Me had me laughing, crying and even seriously contemplating the direction and goals of my own life at times.  However the witty humor and tainted outlook on life, along with the perfectly fitting voice of narration by Ellen Muth kept things light enough to classify DLM as a comedy drama that never disappointed me by resorting to slapstick simpleton humor just to get a laugh.

Describing this show as a ""feel good"" experience seems like a very odd label, but in reality, nails what it is.  This isn't your sentimental ""Touched By an Angel"" approach (which wasn't a bad show don't get me wrong :P) or your doom-and-gloom ""The End is Neigh!"" mentality.  It is a show which illustrates how non-morbid the truth about death is.  Watching this show brought the line that Maximus uttered in Gladiator to mind: ""Death smiles at us all. All a man can do is smile back.""  This is exactly what happens to George.  She finally learns neither to woe her demise or be apathetic to it.

The series is about a group of grim reapers, who take souls, and how they interact and associate with the living. What makes the show interesting is George, the main character, (played by Ellen Muth ) narrates the shows as if you were in her mind. She has a unique perspective. The cast is excellent.

2001084,4,B0001GF2F6,"If you haven't seen ""Dead Like Me"" and have a high tolerance for bad language, you owe it to yourself to check it out.  Apart from the fact that this was a Showtime series (and thus the ""TV Ratings"" gloves were off for the producers), this show is a one-two punch of being very entertaining...and sucking you in the more episodes you watch.  Halfway through series one the writing goes from ""good"" to ""excellent"" and the characters start to come into their own.

If you're not familiar with the concept, this is as spoiler-free as I can make it:  when some people die, they don't get to ""move on"" to the hereafter.  Instead, they are called ""Reapers"", and they've been put in charge of being present when people die.  Living half in and half out of the real world, Reapers have to both tag the unfortunate for death (to release their souls) and guide the newly-departed souls into the beyond.  The show doesn't try to put any religious messages into the concept--instead, there's something amusing about the way they make reaping seem like yet another bureaucratic process that keeps the wheels of civilization turning.  The point isn't the reaping--the point is the characters, and that's why it's really interesting.

It's a real pity this show only lasted two seasons (and a separate movie)--I have a feeling it could have gone a lot farther.  The comedy is grim and macabre, but not mean-spirited.  It's also not very gory.  The only drawback is that the placement of bad language can be jarring at times.",1275868800,2,1509,4.717557251908397
2001085,5,B0001GF2F6,"Not like me - dead, that is! This is a really cute series - one of those shows you just never forget it's so different.

The series, Dead Like Me, is kind of a dark comedy. The series is about a young woman, 18 year old Georgia, who's met with an untimely death when a toilet seat comes crashing to earth from the space station MIR. It's a funny scene - not just because she's hit by a toilet seat which has burst into flames because it's falling from space, but because in an ironic twist Georgia (George) is at lunch on her first day of work, looks up, and sees the toilet seat heading straight for her! At first she doesn't seem to understand she's dead and is in great denial. George finds herself stuck between life and death, appointed to be a reaper - a job she wants no part of.

As a reaper George is still ""in the flesh"", but no longer appears as George to anyone who knew her before. She ""lives"" a somewhat normal ""life"" in that she has a job working in an office, but also meets with the other reapers every day and is given her assignment - who she has to reap that day and at what time. When the reapers touch the intended person, they die, and go on to ... where ever it is they go when they die! On occasion one of the reapers is late, or misses their appointment - which has various unfortunate consequences.

George never seems to get over the fact that she's died, and keeps going back to check up on/spy on/reminisce about her family - something reapers are forbidden to do. There are some pretty funny results of her doing this, especially with her mother - who percieves her as some kind of stalker after she runs into George more than once lurking around their house. There are also some pretty sad moments when it comes to her younger sister, Reggie - who also can't seem to get over Geogia's death. After George's death Reggie rebels by stealing toilet seats from neighbors and school, and hanging them from a tree in a ""secret place"". It's funny in a ironic way.

George's mother, played by Cynthia Stevenson, is an uptight, cold character even before George's death, but afterward takes out her grief on her husband and Reggie. Reggie grows up to be a pretty girl, but she's always kind of alienated from her peers.

Minor characters: In her new ""life"", other than being a reaper, George is employed in an office where her boss, Deloris Herbig, is an odd, motherly character. At home Deloris has her own reality show of sorts - which George finds out about when she has to move in with Deloris and finds herself broadcast on the internet! Deloris has an elderly cat, Murray - who's love of Deloris' life.

Main Characters: The ""head reaper"" is played by Manny Pantankin (Rube) - who is ideal in the part. I don't think there's anyone else who could play the part so well - as we later find out in the movie - which was a huge disappointment to my husband and myself. The other reapers are played by Jasmine Guy (Roxy) who is wonderful as a hard-nosed meter maid. Laura Harris (Daisy Adair) who is beautiful and stuck up. She was an actress in her day who just can't give up on the fact that she'll never act again. To Daisy all the afterlife is a stage. Callum Blue (Mason) a British con man, who's always looking for a con, and is too good looking even for himself - in his opinion! And Rebecca Gayheart (Betty) a former dancer who's character is happy and optimistic.

I originally got the 1st season of ""Dead Like Me"" as a present for our oldest daughter, but she never watched them, so my husband and I ""borrowed"" them. Once we started watching we had to see them all! After watching the first 2 seasons my husband and I searched and were thrilled to find the 3rd season, but then were so disappointed when we found the series ended after 3 seasons.

A movie of ""Dead Like Me"" came out after the series ended. I'm not sure if they were trying to revive the series with a few new characters or what, but there were no other shows after the movie. Manny Pantankin and Laura Harris were not in the movie - which was a huge loss. If the series had gone on it just wouldn't have been the same w/o those key characters. We didn't enjoy the movie because it seemed darker, not funny, and just didn't measure up to the series.",1271030400,,4249,4.3291457286432165

I gave the show a chance, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  I ended up LOVING the show.  It's filled with dark humor and gets you wondering about various things in your life (or at least it did for me...).
The main story line is about George, an eighteen yr old who dropped out of college, and gets killed by a toilet seat from a de-orbiting space station.  After dying she meets Rube, to fills her in that she is going to become a grim reaper, taking souls from people who are about to die violent deaths.  The show follows George as she tried to deal with her death, the trouble that is happening with her sister, and parents, and her new job.  Needless to say she has her hands full.
The show is well cast with Ellen Muth playing George, the main character that gets killed by the toilet seat, Mandy Patinkin playing Rube, the boss of the reapers, Callum Blue playing Mason, the British drug user and alcoholic, Jasmine Guy playing Roxy, the temperamental meter maid who likes keeping people in line, and Laura Harris who plays Daisy, a bubbly ""actress"", that seems to have slept with all the classic film stars.

2001092,5,B0001GF2F6,"No TV series has ever elevated sub-genre ""black comedy"" like ""Dead Like Me,"" a seriously funny, often poignant examination of death and - therefore - life.  Cable TV has given birth to many terrific dramatic series - ""The Sopranos,"" ""The Wire,"" ""Deadwood,"" ""Rome,"" etc.  But there haven't been nearly as many hallowed comedies - proof that comedy is darn hard.  ""Dead Like Me"" attempts to balance the scales.

George (Ellen Muth) is a typical slacker - she lives at home with her dysfunctional family, interested in nothing and nobody.  She gets stuck in a dead-end job doing filing/data entry when she is killed on her first lunch break by a toilet seat falling from a Russian space station.

It only gets better from there.

George's soul is met by Rube (the incomparable Mandy Patinkin), who lays out the new rules:  George is a Grim Reaper.  Her job is to take souls from the newly-departed and escort them to their final destination, whatever that may be.  In a lesser series, George would shrug and the stories would focus on the conflict between her slacker-ness and her new job.  While there is some of that humor, the story quickly becomes much deeper as George comes to terms with the life she has led and the life she still has to lead.

Still has to lead?  That's right. Grim Reapers are part of the everyday world - they need to work or steal to pay the bills.  And so it is that George finds herself back in the corporate trenches, where she learns more about life after dying than she did before.

There are too many perfect moments and perfect casting choices here to mention, so I'll only allude to the highlights.  The pilot episode hits stratospheric heights with George's first ""job,"" to take the soul of an innocent little girl who is scheduled to die - George resists it, naturally, but the show takes this plot point in a delightfully sad, touching way.  Let's just say the Portland's own Pink Martini's rendition of ""Que Sera Sera"" will never be put to better use.

And any actress who claims that there are no good roles for overweight women over 35 have completely ignored Christine Willes' brilliant performance as the zany, uptight Delores Herbig - one part Nurse Ratchet and three parts crazy Aunt Flo.  All the actors do great work here, including Cynthia Stevenson as George's uptight, grieving mom Joy (perfect name!), Callum Blue as a British stoner-Grim Reaper, and Jasmine Guy, who leaves ""A Diff'rent World"" far, far behind.

Solid writing, impeccable comic timing, and more than its fair share of insight and wisdom make Season One of ""Dead Like Me"" one of the best TV seasons ever.  Quite simply, a must-see.",1229126400,,2646,4.708695652173913

However, I couldn't have predicted how great the first episode would be.  I swear on all television holy, the pilot of ""Dead Like Me"" is the single best pilot of any show I've ever seen.  It's hilarious, perfectly scripted, wonderfully acted, and is one of the most heartbreaking and gut busting hours of television there is.

While the pilot really stand out from the rest of the series as the best episode, the rest of this collection ranges from good to great.  I was a bit worried, because creator Bryan Fuller (the reason I bought this in the first place) left after the fifth episode, due to creative differences with MGM.  Executive Producer John Masius takes on show-runner duties and does a very competent job in keeping the show consistent.  He effortlessly maintained the quirky style that Fuller set up for them, probably due mostly to how nicely Fuller set it up in the first place.  But I've gone on and on about the creative team for long enough.  Let's get down to some Muth.

Ellen Muth, who plays the lead character Georgia Lass, is simply brilliant.  She has such a--ironically enough--life to her, giving such a fantastic and layered performance.  I'd go as far as to say she's the best thing this side of Kristen Bell.  The rest of the cast, particularly Mandy Patinkin as Rube and Laura Harris as Daisy Adair, give great performances as well.

Each episode will make you laugh, and almost as many will make you cry.  The ride isn't always perfectly smooth--""Nighthawks"" would have been great if the meat of it had been fleshed out instead of loading it with flashback clips--but it's such an enjoyable show that you're more likely to forget its flaws than dwell on them.  Long live the Reapers!

2001099,3,B0001GF2F6,"Spoilers Galore!! I loved Wonderfalls so I bought both seasons of Dead Like Me. I finished season one and just started two. I like the show but I think they made it up as they went along and there's little internal logic. Other things simply drive me nuts.

The acting is great, especially Ellen Muth, Christine Willies and Cynthia Stevenson, whose scenes I fast-forward through because it's like watching Todd Solondz's Happiness, the most unrelentingly depressing movie I've ever seen. The family drama plot-line is another show in itself and I don't know where it belongs in a dramedy about personal growth and self-realization. Along those lines, a number of episodes end with well-scripted voice-overs describing lessons learned and happiness achieved, yet the following episode sees George just as depressed and listless. So, like in sitcoms, nobody ever learns and nothing really changes.

The reaper's powers and responsibilities are vague, inconsistent and unbelievable even within the confines of science fiction. At the end of the pilot episode George sits in her sister's closet but is not seen by her mother, so she can become invisible, right? Wrong! Reapers are supposed to guide the dead into the light, but they often leave immediately and do nothing. They're only given a name, time and location for reaping, and they have to figure out who that person is. How can this work in large crowds or wide areas where there's a chance the soul won't be removed in time? Why would the reaping system open itself to so much potential failure? It would take nothing away to have the reapers know instinctively who's about to die since the dialogue between reaper and doomed is all that matters anyway.

For some reason the housing issue annoys me. Fine, they live in the homes of the recently deceased. How long can THAT be? Rube seems settled in. Does his building not have a landlord? How do reapers stay out of jail, seeing they're always interacting at crimes scenes, breaking into homes and stealing? Where does Rube get his money? Why doesn't Daisy work? I try to accept the show as is but I think they could have thought through their world a lot more to make it less a minefield of distractions and disbelief.

2001102,5,B0001GF2F6,"No need to summarize and repeat what you can read in a gazillion other places. But among parables about living, DLM ranks, to my mind at least, as one of the best I've seen. As a story writer myself, I find forced to admit that this is probably better than anything I could have cooked up myself. Which is a big admission.

Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy, Angel and Firefly; a man I admire), if he's honest about it, will probably eating his Absurdist heart out (and if he isn't, he ought to be). DLM, despite its lack of the 'spectacular', or maybe because of it, makes its point(s) with clarity and, often, very touching poignancy. And with soul.

It addresses that aspect of 'teen angst' that's not all about 'social acceptance' and the pitfalls of high-school life, but about the profound loneliness that accompanies the clarity of vision that comes upon one in a period of one's life where one is old enough to understand a great many things, but not yet too old to have had the wool pulled over one's eyes by the world and its necessities. And why doesn't everybody else understand it as well? It's so obvious, is it not? How can anybody miss it?

DLM also deals with DEATH. Yes, I know that's pretty obvious, but this obviousness hides the truth that in our dealings with death, imagined or real, we define our position in and attitude to life. DLM's dealing with death is relentless and never lets off. Every episode leaves you with another perspective on the subject; and quite possibly with one that you might not actually have thought of.

Take all that together and you have what might be the most powerful show of recent years. That despite this it sustains an equally unrelenting comedic charm is a testimony to so very, very good story-telling.",1210550400,2,1758,4.589171974522293

I'm just blown away by how cruel and mean the fans of this show are to people who post negative reviews. They give solid reasoning for why they didn't like the show, and fans come along and crucify them for it! Not fair.

In all faireness I was blown away by this show; it wasn't horrible at all. It was great. A dark comedy, for sure, as the reapers make light of a situation in everyone's life that NO ONE wants to deal with. Everyone wants to avoid death somehow; reverse the aging process any way they can, either mentally or physically. Sure no one wants to die. But what I learned from this show is that not everyone really lives either. Like the main character, George, has said many times throughout the show that she regretted not living enough.

Interesting to see Rube (Mandy Patinkin) who I knew from those stupid drug commercials do something with his career (though I guess he did those commercials AFTER the show was cancelled). And Laura Harris from some Nickelodeon show I saw as a kid who replaced Rebecca Gayheart, was an added blessing. Wasn't too crazy about the corny music throughout the show, though, despite it being composed by Stewart Copeland. But I didn't let that hold me back. As the episodes went on it grew on me.

A great show that I'm sad had to end. Look forward to seeing the second season soon.",1210204800,2,2028,4.75

I recently purchased the 1st season, and have finished watching the first half of episodes. The show doesnt get old!

It even has its times of depth, as it is all about dealing with death. But always funny and most always tastefully.

2001106,2,B0001GF2F6,"I have a lot of faith in the Amazon rating system -- oh, sure, there are lots of people out there that don't share my personal tastes, but that's okay.  Still, you figure when over two hundred people rate a TV show like this and give it a near-perfect rating, it's gotta be worth checking out. It worked for ""Wonderfalls,"" ""Slings & Arrows"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"", so I had pretty high hopes for ""Dead Like Me.""

Well, I guess there's an exception to every rule, because I was sorely disappointed by this Showtime series, which has near-universal fuzzy love from the Amazon review pool. It's actually not that good.  The characters are, for the most part, mere stick-figures. The scripts aren't that great; the directing is slack, the uber-ironic, world-weary viewpoint of the slacker narrator is pounded to death in scene after scene. It's a tendentious, unsubtle show, and I struggled to get through it. My wife gave up after the first two episodes, and I have to say, she was totally right. This is okay, I suppose, and I see why it's fans think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread... But there are a lot of things to watch that are much, much better.  Or (gasp!) books to read.

I suppose it would make someone who has watched a lot of trash tv think.

The show is a bit boring as in the lead character is so boring and her voice is such a monologue..and she has literally no spark or ambition.. and that is boring to watch over and over. I just started the first season so I hope she gets an improved personality transplant seasons after this one. As far as I know it might be cancelled, or not, Im not sure.

I have even put a posting or two on my blog about it: [...] The lead character is more easily identified with, she may not be the most positive person, but she portrays any lethargic 18-year-old very well. She is cynical and ignorant but intelligent and observant. The other characters are very full, complete people - they struggle with different things, especially the manner of their deaths and ""living"" beyond their spans and as other people doing an ugly job.

2001117,5,B0001GF2F6,"The first time I'd ever even heard of this show was when I saw this and the second season on shelf in a retail store.  It looked interesting so I picked up season one which is nothing short of brilliant.  I am baffled as to why this was not promoted better when it actually was on TV (I'm assuming it must have been on at some stage).  What hope does a show have not to be canned when no one even knows it exists let alone that it is on?  Whoever was responsible for marketing this show needs to be shown the door, even the DVD seasons aren't being promoted anywhere, I've never seen one advertisement.  So if you've somehow been recommended to this product's page through reading reviews of other products or something all I can say is buy Dead Like Me!  You won't be disappointed.

The series basically revolves around 18 year old George who is a teenage girl who basically doesn't give a crap about and bludges along through life. Too bad for her a toilet seat from the Muir space station is going to cut that life short.  Immediately after her death she is taken under the wing of a couple of grim reapers who initially let her reflect on her life, visit her wake and so forth then drop the bombshell that her new job will be becoming one of them. Yes Grim Reapers don't get paid in conventional ways so George has to return to the very employer she hated where she died during her first the lunch hour.  The death scenes are hilarious, especially the bank death scene in the pilot.  Granted in subsequent seasons they aren't quite as well done as this one but this is explained in the pilot's commentary (which is done by most of the actors), that they did not get the budget or long timeframe to shoot the rest of the episodes.  Even though the death scenes are not as good as that scene all deaths are still very funny as are the office scenes and employment/money getting schemes of the other reapers.  My only criticism of the special features is that none explain why the producers decided to update one of the reaper characters so early on, the storyline for this happening worked very well but I would have liked to have known if this was always intended or did the actress want more money, have other commitments or what?

Get this show though, it's great!  I loved it, have gone and bought the second season as well which I am just about to watch.  I hope in real life/death that reapers are like these ones.",1197849600,2,2422,4.363028953229398

In death she is thrust into life and forced to overcome all the complications that come with it, a task she avoided in life.  An extremely funny cast take the edge off and serve as a support system throughout this series.  As potentially depressing as the plot may seem it is actually very funny and entertaining.  Once I started watching I just couldn't seem to stop.  One word of caution: this show was cancelled after it's second season so don't get too attached.  There is some talk about the show being picked up again, but that is dependent on how well a movie version fairs.

2001126,5,B0001GF2F6,"IMHO 'Dead Like Me"" is the all-time best television series. Of course I like off-kilter stuff that still makes sense and tries to build themes into the story. For those who have not discovered this gem, imagine a cross between ""Tru Calling"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" that pushes the envelope of irreverence about as much as ""The Family Guy"". Then imagine that behind all the surface irreverence is a transcendent reverence for the human condition. If that level of complexity appeals to you, ""Dead Like Me"" is something you should immediately track down.

I was permanently hooked by the conclusion of the ""Pilot"" episode when the resolution did not take the traditional happy path. Instead of being able to intervene and change the destiny of the little girl, George (Ellen Muth) is forced to do her job as a reaper. They go out to the strains of ""Que Sera Sera"", normally very corny but here very ironic. The song was originally written for Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", a film about parents trying to rescue their child which has parallels to what George is attempting. Of course the lyrics and the little girl are symbolic of George and a perfect fit for the ""randomness of life"" theme of ""Dead Like Men"".

Each episode has subtle details like this, which may require repeated viewings just to uncover elements that you missed initially. I recommend purchasing a DVD of each season just to have the flexibility to watch several times at your convenience.

""Dead Like Me,"" has the mark of writers who aren't thinking about audience reaction or how the Showtime executives will relate to it. The story just pours out with a lot of verve, wit, and audacity.

The story is told from the point of view of 18-year-old jaded slacker Georgia ""George"" Lass (Muth), whose voice-over commentary sometimes contradicts what is happening on the screen. Her intelligence and advanced maturity give a world-weary ""whatever"" to the endless bizarre situations she must deal with; ""it looks like death was just my wake-up call"".

Any series that focuses on a teenager killed by a falling toilet seat from the space station Mir has something going for it. George is sometimes called Miss Toilet Seat. She is assigned to Rube (Mandy Patinkin from ""Chicago Hope""), who is kind of a platoon sergeant for a small group of ""not always grim"" reapers (soul collectors) who meet in a German Waffle House (listen for the occasional yodeling in the background).

 There is a running side story about the family George left behind. Her grieving unhappy mother Joy (Cynthia Stevenson),  her professor father, Clancy (Greg Kean), and her sister Reggie (Britt McKillip) who collects toilet seats and may remind you of Dawn Weiner.

The reapers might technically be the undead but they interact with the living 24-7; although in a different body than they had when they were alive. There is no pay but they need a place to stay and food to eat so they get day jobs or relieve the dead of their spare cash. They even have pets; George keeps Mr. Blinky, the little girl's frog from the pilot episode.

Rube gives each reaper a yellow sticky note with a name, address, and an ETD; it's up to the reaper to collect the soul-ideally just before the actual death, and guide them to the next life. Reapers don't know why they got the job or how long they will be performing it; they accept it because it affords them the opportunity to continue to experience the things they liked and disliked about living; and they are not ready to give these up.

As a series ""Dead Like Me"" establishes a complex and consistent set of rules that viewers embrace. The writers are good about playing within this set of constraints and not cheating when they feel lazy or it is otherwise convenient.

Humor of various kinds is the predominant emotion but things often get serious and philosophical in a believable and intelligent fashion.

""When I was just a little girl I asked my mother what will I be? Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? Here's what she said to me.

Que sera, sera. Whatever will be, will be. The future's not ours to see. Que sera, sera... What will be, will be...

2001127,5,B0001GF2F6,"I don't know what to say that others or the product itself cannot say for itself.

2001129,4,B0001GF2F6,"Dead Like Me is an intelligent, irreverent, short-lived Showtime series about death and the implications it has for life.  Smart, snarky teenage slacker Georgia ""George"" Lass (Ellen Muth), who ""excels at not giving a shit,"" is killed on her lunch break from a boring temp job by a toilet seat crashing to earth from the MIR space station - and that's in the first half hour of the pilot.  Rather than the end, this is the beginning of her new life as a Grim Reaper, undead persons who reap the souls from the living just before death and help them on their way to an afterlife that is very deliberately kept vague, but seems to be inviting and tailor-made for each individual.

Stuck in an unpaid and unpleasant job she can neither refuse nor quit, George spends the first few episodes rebelling and looking for loopholes, which sets her at odds with her kindly but authoritarian Reaper boss, Rube (Mandy Patinkin).  She gets help and advice on coping with her new unlife from her fellow Reapers: Betty, a free-spirited flapper who died in the 20s (Rebecca Gayheart); Mason, a cheerful lowlife who died chasing the ""ultimate high"" in the 60s (Callum Blue); Roxy, a grumpy hard-nosed meter maid (Jasmine Guy); and Daisy, a frilly, self-centered would-be starlet from the 30s (Laura Harris).

Although the living see them as someone other than their former selves, Reapers have physical bodies and must eat and sleep, although they heal very quickly when injured.  George ends up squatting in a grubby apartment abandoned by one of Mason's reaps, and for income returns to the ""Happy Time"" temp agency and the same job she hated before she died.  However, with a new identity and a slightly better attitude, she quickly makes a friend of the quirky but big-hearted Happy Time boss, Dolores Herbig (Christine Willes).

George had little use for her family before she died, but finds herself obsessed with them afterwards, and, despite Rube's instructions and her fellow Reapers' advice to the contrary, she frequently visits her old home as ""Millie"" to see how they are coping and how they remember her.  Her tightly-wound, hyperorganized mother, Joy (Cynthia Stevenson) and her glib, easy-going father, Clancy (Greg Kean) cling to denial and find it harder and harder to talk to each other.  George's brainy, introverted little sister Reggie (Britt McKillip) enters into a morbid phase of collecting toilet seats and dead birds and trying to contact her sister by Ouija board.

The cast is excellent, the writing sharp and insightful, the directing and score and visual effects good-to-excellent.  The series is mostly very funny, but has a deft touch for slipping in philosophy and pathos from time to time.  Themes of life and death, fate, morality, responsibility, and what people mean to one another are constantly in play, but the characters do not sit around discoursing on the profound.  Like George's highly entertaining narrative voice-overs, the series raises the big questions but makes no attempt to answer them beyond providing a panoply of lives and deaths, ranging from the elaborately absurd to the deeply moving.  The main characters are multi-layered, expertly crafted, and beautifully portrayed.  Their very human flaws and failings are on display alongside surprising strengths and nobilities - the series very carefully avoids setting up any one character as the touchstone of insight and truth.

There's plenty of black comedy in this series about death and the undead, but very little shock-for-shock's-sake.  There's also a fair amount of profanity, mostly from George.  People who are uncomfortable with those aspects, or who are uncomfortable with a series that treats religious ideas as open to question (while carefully avoiding any definite answers) probably won't like Dead Like Me.  And the series, like George, died young without fulfilling its potential.  There were two seasons, both abbreviated, 14 episodes in Season One and 15 in Season Two.  By no means was the series brought to a conclusion in Season Two - unfinished plot arcs and half-addressed character issues abound - but the final episode in each season does a reasonably good job of providing at least a degree of emotional closure and a decent stopping-place for the characters and their respective stories.

As much as I love the series, I don't particularly love the DVD sets.  The set for Season One is on four disks.  Disk One has the two-hour Pilot and all the extras, while the other three disks contain the remaining episodes.  Among the extras are deleted scenes from episodes throughout the first season, which would have been better connected with their respective episodes.  There are two behind-the-scenes features which allow the non-screen creative people to contribute their insights with illustrative clips from various episodes - interesting, but neither extensive nor profound.  The only audio commentary is for the Pilot episode, more entertaining than revelatory, by Ellen Muth, Mandy Patinkin, Jasmine Guy, Callum Blue, and Cynthia Stevenson.  The rest of the special features are throw-aways, including a stills gallery, and there is no captioning available in any language.  Each episode is divided into only five ""scenes,"" and there is (annoyingly) no way to skip the opening theme sequence without missing the first part of the episode.",1187136000,4,5357,5.117106773823192

2001134,4,B0001GF2F6,"What do I like in this series? The new perspective: life starts (or could start in our world) after death for some people; good characters (see the details below), though the Mason character loses his flavour by the second season and Betty is lost in the fifth episode (the fourth on the second disk); and of course humour, which is sarcastic and sometimes morbid, but perfectly fits a sitcom.

So, the characters:
--George, most of the time rebelling against any authority but gradually recognises that human relationships are important.
--Rube, the boss whom George often drives mad but takes a (fatherly) liking of the wild but at the same time extremely vulnerable girl. He tries to be a good and strong foreman with a sometimes abrasive manner.
--Mason, the crazy and amoral English guy, a hapless fellow, who has drinking and drug problems, he has no luck with human relationships, lacks the ability to form any.
--Roxy, the traffic warden, no-nonsense hard-working lady, who mostly manages to hide her emotions but it does not mean they don't exist.
--Betty, the one who really enjoys being a grim reaper, it seems to be a vocation for her. She is genuinely nice to the would be dead and never lets them die without making them smile first.
--Daisy (who stands in for Betty after she leaves), the blond one, egotistic, gets what she wants and first does not seem to care about other people's feelings, though she begins to learn something on this front.

It's four stars because the last three episodes reek of financial constraints: loads of flashbacks and reminiscences. There are some good ideas and jokes, but all in all they seem to be last ditch efforts by a reserve crew after the real crew went on holiday.

They're Grim Reapers--and don't envy the power.  You see, like any other bureaucracy, Death issues unfunded mandates.  Reapers may be dead, but they've got to work to pay the bills--as well as their 'day job' of collecting souls. So, what they get are part-time jobs that they can leave when the inevitable post-it note gets handed to them with name and time of death of their next victim.

The season focuses on Georgia Lass, an 18 year old Seattle based college dropout who becomes a Reaper after the flaming toilet from the Mir space station falls on her head.  We see her struggling through her death, watching her family move on without her, and trying to adjust to her 5 person team of Reapers.

2001147,5,B0001GF2F6,"""Dead Like Me"" unfortunately fell into that group of television shows that confront uncomfortable, although realistic, topics.  As was the case with ""Arrested Development"", a show that was too short-lived due to its head-on take on the modern dysfunctional family, ""Dead Like Me"" causes the viewer some discomfort at first, knowing that several characters will be killed each episode.  Perhaps this is why the show never developed the following it truly deserved -- try convincing a friend that you want them to watch a show where a grim reaper takes souls from dying bodies, and unless your friend is a science-fiction or horror fan, the friend has probably immediately been turned off.  Explaining the show in this manner is akin to explaining ""The Sopranos"" as a simply show about mobsters -- while the narrative surrounds this concept, the real substance of the show, and what makes it truly special, is the development of the characters and the life-lessons that are learned.  Just as ""The Sopranos"" is compelling because we feel we can truly understand both the triumphs and struggles of Tony Soprano, so too is ""Dead Like Me"" compelling as we watch as a young girl struggle with the concept of death while undergoing self-realization and reflection about the meaning of life.  While grim reapers and gravelings may seem to be only the domain of science fiction, the difference with ""Dead Like Me"" is that it superimposes these elements on top of a real-life girl's struggle to answer the question that most young adults face -- ""What do I want to do with my life?""  Only after dying can this girl begin to truly understand what it meant to be alive.  For this reason, the show comes highly recommended to anybody, young or old, asking themselves those same questions about the purpose and meaning of one's own life.  The show presents a hopeful and positive view of death and the afterlife, and for that reason the show is also highly recommended to anyone experiencing sickness or death of a loved one.

2001151,5,B0001GF2F6,"In its' original run on the premium cable channel, 'Showtime' I had only seen the comedy-drama, ""Dead Like Me"" once, while away on vacation. It piqued my interest, but I never got a chance to see any more of it (I've only got HBO at home). But last 'Father's Day', my wife surprised me with the gift of both DVD box sets of the show's only two seasons. I have no ideal if I'm suppose to read deeper morbid meaning into, that particular selction, but it turned out to be a brilliantly entertaining show, that left us entranced!

For those who don't know, the cable series, ""Dead Like Me"" is humorous examination (with dramatic overtones) of both life and death. We meet 18 year-old, Georgia Lass (Ellen Muth), who has dropped out of college and is stuck (for a morning) in a dead-end job. She dosn't seem to care about anything or anyone in her dead-end life. But that life is pretty short, when destiny preordains her on a fatal collision course with a toilet seat falling out of the sky. But instead of becoming merely dead, she becomes one of the un-dead. She joins a mysteriously chosen class of deceased folks, known as 'Reapers', who when not 'living' and working amongst us, must remove and guide the souls from the coporal bodies of those, who die in horrible (and many times humorous)accidents, murders and suicides.

The group of 'Reapers', who take George under their wing include the paternal leader, Rube (Mandy Patinkin), the hard nosed metermaid, Roxy (Jasmin Guy), the unprincipled, British delinquent, Mason (Callum Blue), the flighty, short lived (pun intended) character Betty (Rebecca Gayheart) and her replacement, self-involved, former silver screen actress, Daisy Adair (Laura Harris). This disperate group of the undead fight, bicker, joke and help each other out as they await their daily post-it assignments of death at 'The Waffle Haus' restaurant.

This show may sound morbid, but in actuality it is 'black humor' and drama at its' best. The ironic theme of the show is that George really dosn't start living until she is dead. She slowly must come to terms with her own death and in the process learns to apreciate the life she had and the love ones/family, that were a part of it.

Everything about this show is just great. Almost everyone of the scripts are like home runs hit out of the park. The stories are moving and emotional without being treacly. They make you want to both laugh and cry. The dialogue is smart and well written. The Rube Goldberg set-ups for the many deaths featured are a ying-yang of being both macabre and hilarious.

The series also has a wonderful ensemble cast. Ellen Muth shines as the moody anchor of the story, acting as a guide to her life among the living and the dead. All her fellow actors are great. I particularly like Mandy Patinkin as the cantankerous, Rube and Laura Harris as Daisy. Also kudos should be given to actors Cynthia Stevenson and Britt McKillip for there amazing chemistry together as George's mom and little sister.

This a is wonderful show and I love both seasons. To me, it is inexplicable, why this brilliant cable program was cut off after only two seasons. It just leaves you wanting more! Both DVD box sets are highly recommended!",1174003200,4,3223,4.746428571428571

The show looked interesting enough but it would be about two years later when I would rent the first disc and watch the first episode of the show. To say the least, I was utterly enthralled. A couple of months later, I bought the first season of the show.

The show begins with the character of George Lass' death by toilet seat. She soon meets a whole group of Grim Reapers and finds out she will be a reaper herself. Throughout the 14 episodes of the first season, she faces many obstacles and mysteries associated with being one of the undead. One of the most intriguing is her continued ventures to see her family, with whom she never had a good relationship with when she was alive.

The cast (Ellen Muth, Callum Blue, Mandy Patinkin, Jasmine Guy...) are AMAZING and it's hard to imagine any other people portraying them. The characters are one of the most realistic ones ever shown on television. They can act out subtle dramatic moments and they excel in comedy. That's another thing about the show, it never strays in Lifetime-esque dramatics when it comes to characters dying. It makes the show better.

I began to root for her every time she had a new delimma to face without the back up of her family.  Getting a job, an apartment, food and friends (the other grims in her little area).  No one really likes George at first and she's really not very likable, but that begins to change. George's little sister is kind of a morbid little thing and that doesn't change.  She starts out by collecting toilet seats from neighbors, school and wherever she can find them and hanging them in a tree. Sort of a living memorial to her big sister.  The other Characters in this series are funny and strange in the way that everyday life is. We all know people like her new boss and the receptionist at Happy Time Temp Agengy. George finds a job at a Temp agengy (being a temp at the temp agency), and begins a study of life and death.  This is a wonderfully complex series with a dry wit.

If you can suspend whatever personal beliefs you have and embrace this fantasy, you'll be rewarded with a cleverly written and even more cleverly acted story.

It revolves mostly around Georgia, an 18 year old girl who joins the ranks of the reapers after a stray piece of space toiletry obliterates her physical form. The entire show is narrated by our heroine, adding humorous observations that make you stay up until 1:30 A.M. just to finish off all the episodes on the disc. We're presented with death and its aftermath in a way that doesn't judge sinner from saint: Everyone dies somehow. The dark comedic spin that adds flair to this somber topic makes it one of the best shows that, sadly, is now as departed as the reapers themselves.

The intro with the scythes and cloaks was just too much for my sheltered mind to handle! Who were these people?! Why do they think this subject is funny?! The very idea was too ludicrous for me to wrap my brain around! BUT...after a few of my favorite programs were ended ""prematurely"" by the Networks and ""Dead Like Me"" was in re-runs on the Sci-Fi Channel...I decided to take a closer look at this extremely strange/edgy program. Why had it lasted for two years? If it was actually that bad...wouldn't it have ""tanked"" in the first 6 episodes? Just like a lot of those other ""ground breaking"" programs had in previous years. This show has something that the other shows wished they had...TALENT and CHEMISTRY. It reminds me of the writing/acting from the 70's. ""All in the Family, Barney Miller, or Taxi"" all of them took a while to find an audience, but are now cult classics; because they had talent and chemistry. I highly recommend that you ""bite the bullet"" and watch this wonderful program...and then move on to the second, and sadly last season. The characters are wonderful and touching.

------------

To fully appreciate a review I think it's important to know a little about the reviewer. This particular reviewer is about 25, male and likes when his TV-screen shows him something a little more intelligent. I've never really liked the mainstream shows like ""Friends"" and ""Desperate housewives"" even though I (still) watch ""Lost"" and ""Prison break"". My favorite shows are ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Heroes"", ""Wonderfalls"", ""The L-word"" and off course ""Dead like me"". I should probably also mention that I'm Swedish so my English might not be the best at times.

This review is for both seasons of the show, since what I will write here also holds for the second season.

THE STORYLINE

-------------

""Dead like me"" is centered around a girl named Georgia ""George"" Lass, an eighteen year old with with doubts about the meaning of her life. She can't communicate with her mother, her father has an affair with one of his students and her little sister might as well be invisible, for all she cares. This could be the plot of a another mainstream teenage drama series, but instead George is hit by space debris and dies.

Instead of passing on or anything like that she finds herself having to work for the undead as a grim reaper, taking peoples souls before they die, saving them the unpleasantness of the actual death and helping them ""pass on"". Despite their good deed to society reapers don't get paid ""through proper channels"" and they still have to make a living, either by a day job or petty larceny what ever means they can find. They do get a new appearance though so they won't attract the attention of the people they knew when they were alive.

We get to follow George as she struggle to make a new life for herself, dealing with her new job, her day job, her old family and finding the meaning and purpose in (un)life she never found when she was alive.

THE REVIEW

----------

I could probably say a million things about this show but I will try to focus on the most important aspects.

First of all, it must be said that ""Dead like me"" is foremost a humor series, with a dark and a little twisted humor. But the show also deals with very serious questions like life and death, fate and circumstance, friends and family and the meaning and purpose of life. This mix of comedy and drama would normally scare me of, since shows like that have a habit of being over dramatic. Especially when dealing with these kind of ""life and death"" issues. I'm thinking about shows like Ally Mcbeal which I found quite funny to begin with but that soon tried a little too hard to get it's point across. Dead like me never has this problem, partly because the humor and drama scenes are well separated, and partly because all the deaths in the show are really silly and unlikely. This un-dramatizes it all. It also helps that the makers of the show doesn't try to shove some neatly packed, morally correct answer to all those life and death questions down your throat. In fact they don't try to answer any questions at all, they just seem to ask the questions in a different way. Also, the show never gets religious in any way. It is never assumed that God and Jesus Christ is waiting on the other side. Heaven and hell are mentioned a few times but most of the worlds religions include the concept of a heaven and a hell so that doesn't bother me in any way.

The actors in the show are really great. Normally you see a show with a couple of actors managing to bring their characters to life. In ""Dead like me"" all characters are marvelously interesting. Sometimes it's even a little bit disturbing that so many of them die in the show because you would like to know more about them. But you can rest assure that the you will be able to at least get to know the small group of reapers that George is part of; Betty, Roxy, Mason, Daisy and their leader Rube. The humorous nature of the show off course means that all the characters are quite stereotypical and strange but in many ways they are also very normal. They have personalities just like any normal person and their sometimes strange behavior is completely understandable given the fact that they have been dead for quite some time.

The dialog and setting (is that the right word) of the whole show is also absolutely spot on. There are many conversations that you really remember long after you've seen the show, and most of them are really funny. There is a particular dialog between George and Mason about frogs that I find very amusing, watch out for that one.

If I'm to complain about anything at all about this show it has to be that they sometimes rely a bit too much on computer animations. I really can't see why they couldn't use real props in some of the scenes and some of the animations are a bit sloppy. But this is definitely not of major concern and it definitely not something that is going to make me lower the five star rating of this show.

So if you like a strange and different show  with a lot of humor and brains then you should really see ""Dead like me"", because this is probably the best show I have ever seen so far in my life. Or as George would probably have but it:

""This show is so good it would probably kill me... again""",1168128000,,5237,4.483193277310924

This TV show has to be the worst ever TV show I have seen and had it not been for the fact that I was stuck on an island with nothing to do I would have given up on watching this series very early into the season.  Forcing myself to view the whole season all I kept on thinking about was how anyone could ever like the show one bit.

Firstly nothing happens.  It is also not funny and there isn't even an exciting cliffhanger type the story to the season.  Furthermore the acting is terrible especially from the main character George Lass.  I don't know how she got casted but throughout the season all you ever saw her doing was pulling that face of hers in a sarcastic pose rolling her eyes at the same time.  I kept on watching hoping some form of story would develop but all I saw was a group of people sitting in a cafe talking and then going off to touch people at specific times of the day. I actually thought that this aspect would be a minor component of the show as it was so boring but to my horror this cafe and then touching people aspect was the show.  The complete series was a joke and I am baffled at the 5 star reviews I have seen here.  I feel cheated out of my money and even at 10 dollars for the complete season I would not touch it.

Georgia 'George' Lass is a bored college dropout who gets killed by a toilet seat that falls from a space station.  She's recruited to be one of the Reapers, the people who live between life and death and guide souls out of their bodies. The Reapers hang out at the Waffle House which has breakfast all day long and polka music.  They are an eccentric group and include a minor crook, a 20s flapper and a cop all under the leadership of Rube (Mandy Patikin).  Every day they get their assignments of people who are going to die.

George hates being a Reaper just like she hates all jobs.  she doesn't even get paid so she has to live in the apartments of the recently departed and get a job.  She takes a job as a temp at Happy Times placement agency.  She also visits her home and watches her family trying to go on as they grieve for her.

Ellen Muth is hysterical as George and has the perfect sullen expression of a bored, cynical young woman.  Christine Willes just got funnier and funnier as Dolores Herbig, George's boss at Happy Time.

After 18 year old George is hit by a toilet seat from the sky, she meets Rube, her future Reaper boss who calmly informs her that she is dead. He also tells her it is now her job to help with the undertaking of souls.

I think the cast of Dead Like Me is a major factor that leads to the success of the show, with all the characters having gone through different death experiences, each holding a distinct view about dead. I think the role of George makes it easier for adolescents to relate to as she was an ordinary 18 year old high school graduate who couldn't understand the point of going to college.

The director relates the characters to real life society with George representing confused and inexperienced adolescents, Mason carrying the figure of a hippy, who constantly tries to escape the sorrow of reality by losing himself in psychedelic substances, Roxy the single middle aged underachiever who desperately seeks a higher social status, and Daisy the young woman who was emotionally exploited by heartless men.

But on her first day of work her life is cut short by a toilet seat falling from a space station.  It is then that her life really begins.  Being dead George meets people whose job it is to collect the souls of those dying from accidents.  They are called grim reapers.  But after her funeral George discovers that she will not be moving on, she is joining the ranks of the reapers.

Throughout her short life George did very little and seemed to care for even less.  Now as a reaper, she begins to learn more about life than she ever did while alive.  The life of a reaper is not glamorous.  She must still make her way in the world that she is no longer a real part of.  While balancing reaping with existing, George finds herself constantly being drawn back to her family (considered a no-no for reapers).  George must try to walk the thin line between what she wants to do and what she is supposed to do.

This is a surprisingly good series that manages to celebrate life in a way most cannot.  Strange when death is the main theme.  Dark humor and true life lessons combine with an interesting cast of characters that include an addict, a hot-head, a thrill-seeker, an actress and the enigmatic Rube, boss of George's little group.

I was SOOO disappointed, but, fortunately for me(better late than never I guess), I have seen nearly, if not all of the episodes and always keep a search for it when it is re-running.

Anyhow, short of just probably a handful of television programs, Dead like Me is one of the best I have ever seen. It mixes just about every human(and ""non-human"" or dead/undead)emotion there is simultaneously and is so convincing that these situations almost seem possible, whether or not you ""believe"" in an afterlife or not. I guess due in part to the fact that our ""reapers"" are just your average, everyday people who did have lives, families, careers, problems, etc. and that nobody is ""safe"" from some bizarre, freak accident when you are out there in the world, whether it be on an airplane, or just walking down the street on your lunchbreak.

I think the casting of this show was impeccable especially with Ellen Muth as ""George/Millie"" and Mandy Patinkin as ""Rube, the supe"". Her glum and sort of ""whatever/GTH"" attitude toward things just really blends well with her counterparts and I especially like the relationship between she and Rube. He seems sort of like the ""father-figure"", but no-nonsense boss that someone with her attitude needs to push and motivate her along. Then, Callum Blue.....I just ADORE him. He can be such an irresponsible screw-up, but at the same time does show signs of tenderness and caring toward others as well. It's almost like instead of being a 20 or 30something bloke from the 60's drug era, he could be the little boy down the street always into something and coming up with the ""next great idea or scam"". Then of course the rest of the cast is great as well, and I especially like the little gal who plays George's lil sis.

To summarize, a VERY entertaining and thought provoking show, in my opinion. I just wish it had received the notoriety and following that shows like ""Six Feet Under""(another great one), ""Sex and the City"" and some of the other cable shows received.

serious issues such as what respect the dead deserve, the need to
value each day as precious, the forging of family relationships,
the nature of Good and Evil.  Nevertheless, this is a very funny show, offbeat, but vastly entertaining.  My favorite scene: one of the female grim reapers has a day job as a meter maid. One outraged citizen demands that she take the ticket back and assaults the meter maid.  In anger, she lifts out the citizen's soul, strangles it, and then puts it back into his body.  When she meets him again, he has turned into a pacifist who has made a shrine to the meter maid.  Later when she has his truck towed, he responds that he understands her...""you are a vengeful God.""  Another wonderful scene is the depiction of
the trauma that a younger sister has when her older sister

As he calls himself a movie critic, I respectfully submit that he might want to actually criticize the show for what it is, rather than for not being some other show he wishes it were.  It's not scary.  It's not meant to be.  It's a comedy.  Scary may be good, but the chills he's talking about don't belong in this particular show.  Further, anyone who bothers to think about the whole Reaper system as devised for this show will be able to come up with dozens of ways that it doesn't work, doesn't quite make sense.  But that's okay.  This show does not put forth a theological, philosophical, metaphysical or any other workable system of the afterlife, because that's not what it's about.  This show is not about how we die, or why.  This show is about how we live.  And the observations it makes and questions it asks, while occasionally trite, heavyhanded and clichd, are far more often quite poignant, profound (as far as television goes), and painfully funny.  This show works far more often than not, and has had me laughing and closer to crying than any other show I can think of.  Do yourself a favor and watch both seasons, and then seek out Bryan Fuller's other show, the delightfully whimsical, quite brilliant WONDERFALLS, which was cancelled after only three or four episodes but has all fourteen that were filmed in the DVD set.",1127779200,4,1819,4.655172413793103

Not only was the writing so innovative, but it was cast beautifully (if you didn't have an interesting, remarkable face, you didn't get into this series), but the idea was so incredibly unique and original. Compare this series to any vapid ""s*it-coms"" on Network TV and you'll see.

I didn't know who Ellen Muth (George) was or where she came from, but she's an utterly charming actress with a lot of spunk and grit. I hope she gets cast in movies and TV shows. I want to see more of her. She perfectly grasped a difficult role in which a directionless 18 yr old is killed and suddenly has to deal with Life's (and mostly Death's) huge issues in a hurry. She was just floating through life wasting it when it was taken away in half a heartbeat, now she and the other Reapers are stuck in a terrible Limbo where they must start the mechanics of a terrible freak accident or murder every day.

  The entire casting was perfect and I worked with a PR robot boss like Delores Herbig (as in herbig brown eyes. George changed that to as in herbig fat a$$-my favorite line.) The show was as funny as Cheers,(funniest episode was when George lost her virginity and the guy never called her back) but deep enough in its philosophy of life to make you tear up. I loved the New Age type music score and the stunning photography of Canada. I loved EVERYTHING about this series. Now it's all gone forever. The truly weird thing was that Rebecca Gayheart, who was killed off in Season one, actually was a reaper in real life, having failed to stop at a crosswalk and killing a child.

IF NETWORK TV HAD A BRAIN THEY WOULD BUY UP THESE CANCELLED CABLE SHOWS, CLEAN UP THE LANGUAGE, AND START SHOOTING NEW EPISODES BECAUSE NETWORK TV STINKS AND IS DEVOID OF VERY MUCH CREATIVITY !

This series takes a topic most people are afraid to approach (Death) and puts a light-hearted spin on it.  Not only has this show allowed me to probe into myself deeper, made me face my own fears of death, but it has inspired me to live more fully, to cherish every minute, and to believe that perhaps there is hope for a better afterlife other than the heaven/hell scenario that seems to scare us into submission and docility.

""Dead Like Me"" woke me up.  I used to go through the motions, just eat, sleep, work....but now I view life as more of an opportunity. That life is really what you make of it.  We can choose to be miserable and bitchy (like the character Joy, Georgia's mother), or we can learn from our thoughts and actions and just try and do the best job we can at whatever our jobs are (like the ""Reapers"").

I started watching this show because one of my friends said the character ""Georgia Lass"" reminded her of me.  LOL, how true, how true. After the first episode, I was hooked and still watch the reruns religiously.  :)

The characters are hysterically funny even if they are dealing with a morbid subject.  The whole take on what goes on in life, during death, and after death is refreshing.",1120089600,7,1399,4.42578125

Here you had perfectly good television with a loyal (i.e. ratings-challenged) following. You also had great material and terrific writing to work with but look what happens. It gets the boot after two seasons. Now, I'm not big into whining but I need to say something here. Axing this show was a big mistake, something right along the lines of cancelling Angel, Firefly and Wonderfalls. Because with a little support and time, the show could've been spectacular. Now contrary to what some believe, this series is very different from Six Feet Under (also seeing its end very soon) despite sharing a similar basic premise (seeing dead people). Both shows are fun and smart, but I've always preferred Dead Like Me because its storyline works better for me.

It is probably too late to try and ""save"" the series but hey, at least one can always look back at the dvd sets (season 2 for DLM is coming very soon) and enjoy them for what they are, a hilarious and oftentimes serious take on death and the afterlife.

2001236,4,B0001GF2F6,"In the summer of 2003, I read about a new show coming to Showtime called ""Dead Like Me"" which seemed interesting, but unfortunately I don't have the premium cable channels. So, there I was just waiting for the inevitable release of the DVD set. All I have to say is that it was worth the wait. The writing is mostly well done, though the ""George flouts the rules in some way"" storyline could've been used for like two episodes before going to more fertile creative ground. The characters are perhaps where the show excels. All of the characters at some point will annoy you, but then something'll happen that'll make you love them. Still, the writers needed to work more on the Daisy Adair character. There was no part of her character that was appealing and there were very little ""saving grace"" aspects to her. My favorite character would have to be Dolores Herbig, for probably the same reasons as other reviewers here. The DVDs are very nice with good picture. I haven't had a chance to look at the extras, though they do seem a little slim for 14 episodes. My biggest problem with the set is the descriptions for the episodes. Either they allude to something that is barely mentioned like ""Reaper Madness"" and the ""biblical proportions"" thing or make the episode sound like an afterschool special like ""Business Unfinished"" and the ""lessons of the afterlife for all.""

If you like having all the answers, all the time than DLM is not the show for you. If you like shows that make you think about something in your life, then at least one episode of the season will have you thinking. No matter what, try an episode or two, maybe you'll love it as much as I do.",1117929600,3,1665,4.55

The series drags along, and has no real momentum. The story lines are lousy, and the season finale was dreadfully pitiful. One of the later episodes in the first season is about the gravelings taking a day off, and the grim reapers having to file paperwork for the souls that have been taken over the time.-It seems like they were already running out of bad ideas, so they came up with another poor one. If anyone here agrees with me in the slightest, I advise to check out Nip/Tuck, or Sopranos, or Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld.-Guaranteed not to be disappointed.",1117497600,9,836,4.732876712328767

 DLM centres around George, who we meet on the last day of her 18 years of life. But luckily (though she doesn't see it that way) she doesn't pass to the other side, she has been chosen for a special job - a reaper - collecting the souls of people about to die, and sending them to the other side.

 George isn't alone in this, in her area there is a team of 4 other reapers lead by Rube, to help and guide her in her new life...

 DLM really goes the extra mile when we also follow George's parents and younger sister as they try to deal with this bombshell, and move on.

Simply an amazing show: at times serious, funny and shocking, you are always left thrilled.

The post-it's? that is unique, and there is the whole mystery behind the who gives the list. Oh, and the post-it's only come from Rube.

Ellen Muth, who really was an unknown coming into this series, does a terrific job as George, a slacker who remains unmotivated even after becoming undead.  While her character initially comes across as abrasive and somewhat annoying, she eventually shows a softer underbelly, especially with regards to the mother and sister she mostly disliked while alive.

Mandy Patinkin is his usual self, someone who many will like while others will hate.  His Rube is the leader of this group of the undead, and Patinkin gives his character an everyman quality that I found endearing.  Of the other supporting cast, Cynthia Stevenson stands out as George's still-grieving mom who also has a difficult younger daughter with whom to deal.  I felt that Rebecca Gayheart was the weak link among the cast, but she thankfully left during the season.

The stories are pretty simple, dealing with the taking of souls.  However, these tales are used to take a look at the life of George and the members of her group.  Happy and sad, funny and depressing, but always entertaining.  I'm shocked that anyone could find this show as unappealing as some do.

2001241,5,B0001GF2F6,"I love Dead Like Me and this product is perfect for those of us who don't have Showtime, but have seen and fallen in love with the show at a friends house. I recieved this DVD set as a gift and I love it.

Dead Like Me is a show about Georgia (aka George, Millie, Toilet Seat Girl, Peanut etc) and the experience of her death. George is (was) an 18 year old who, after dropping out of college her first semester moves back in with her parents and kid sister. Upon being nagged by her mother to get a job, George begins clerical work at a place called Happy Time. On her first day working at Happy Time she goes out of the office to grab a quick lunch when she encounters a man on the street who asks her name and touches her when she walks away, then she gets hit in the head with a toilet seat which fell from space and dies... sounds weird but it's well done.

Right after her death George realizes that she has not left the earth, and is confused by this. She ends up meeting some Grim Reapers, Rube being the boss (played by Mandy Patakin), and they explain to her that she is dead and that she is to be a Grim Reaper. Rube explains that when you die and you weren't a good person, nor a bad person you have to become a Reaper for sometime until you fill your Quota of souls. So what George's job as a Reaper is that she must take the souls out of people who are about to die accidential\painful deaths so that that person will feel no pain. Rube gives this particular group of Reapers their assignments daily, which consist of enitials, and address, and an E.T.D. (estimated time of death) and the Reapers are to find this person and take their soul out of their bodies.

You might be wondering how she can walk around the same city she was living in without some people knowing her, this is covered, in this show the dead take on different names to the public (George is Millie) and they look very different to the living.

The show follows George as she gets used to the fact that she is dead, and her coping with the fact that being dead doesn't change the fact that she now needs a place to ""live"" (which the Reapers show her that she can inhabit the apartments of dead people who no one knew were dead yet), and the fact that she needs to get a real world job (which she happens to go back to Happy Time). The Reapers are all friendly with each other and hang together in a diner.

The show also deals with George's family and how they deal with her loss. Her mom, who never really got along with George is extreamly guilty, her little sister who George always ignored misses her more than anyone, and her dad privatly grieves. George, looking different is able to have somewhat regular encounters with members of her family, and she finds out some family secrets which explain alot of the relationship problems her parents have.

This show is great. It is funny and sad all at once. I guess some would call it dark comedy. The cast is incredibly talented and make the show that much more fun to watch. The DVD set is packaged nicely and the special features are fun.",1113782400,6,3077,4.242320819112628
2001242,5,B0001GF2F6,"My current theory on the mysteries of television programming is that all the good shows have left the networks, and they're heading for the premium cable channels. Think about it. NYPD Blue and Angel are gone; West Wing is but a pale shadow of its former self. The Sopranos and Six Feet Under are getting all the critical praise these days.

So it shouldn't have surprised me that premium cable's other show about coping with death is so good. The formula is simple and obvious: who better to approach the issue of one's own mortality than a dead person? In the case of Dead Like Me, death is approached by not one, but several dead people.

Apparently, if you fit certain criteria -- and you fill someone's quota -- upon your death, you're pressed into service as a Grim Reaper. You get a list of deaths for the day, and you take custody of the departed souls until they reach their final destination. As an undead person, explains Rube (Mandy Patinkin in a perfect role), you have ""certain rights and privileges."" A physical body, for example, and the ability to interact with the living (though the living see you as a different person than you were in life). The Reapers of Dead Like Me are not mystical skeletons; they're -- pardon the pun -- working stiffs. Of course they don't get paid, so they have to either work a day job or find other nefarious ways of paying for such amenities as clothing, food and a home.

Some of this show's best moments deal with such mundane elements as finding a home, keeping a job, or blundering through a get-rich-quick scam. But it really shines when the mix of the mundane and the macabre takes a sudden turn for the serious. In the series pilot, George, our heroine, is suddenly killed by the meteoric landing of Mir's zero-gravity toilet. It's a bizarre situation treated in such a way that it's ridiculously funny. Somehow, Dead Like Me doesn't lose its humorous edge, even as George accompanies Rube to her own autopsy (""The first man to touch my naked body was a coroner."") and her own funeral. If you can laugh at an autopsy, you've begun to insulate yourself from the pain of death; can you laugh at your own autopsy?

This first season is short, with only 14 episodes. In them, George and her family begin coping with her death, but we see that it's a long road. George's Reaper colleagues have been dead a lot longer than she has, and still don't seem to have wrapped up their lives. Daisy is still the same Southen belle actress who had an affair with Clarke Gable on the set of Gone With the Wind. Roxy is still troubled by her death at the hands of the woman who stole her invention: leg-warmers. Mason hasn't learned from a drug-induced attempt to free his mind. And Rube... well, we still don't have Rube's story, apart from the fact that his first car was made in 1898.

It's a huge subject, death. And it's an interesting way to look at death, through the eyes of those who have lost their own lives and see others' deaths every day. So, it's got heavy stuff, but Dead Like Me is the most wickedly funny show currently on TV. True comedy comes from dramatic situations; we laugh when our brains can't cope with the ridiculousness or magnitude of a situation. Drama and comedy are two sides of the same chihuahua, and it's a pity that more TV producers haven't realized that. Dead Like Me blends gravitas with black comedy in ways that are unsubtle, unavoidable, and utterly captivating.",1113696000,6,3444,4.548387096774194

For example, one of the characters (the blonde who replaces Rebecca Gayheart) is an actress from the 20's that constantly mentions giving oral favors to famous actors in between sets or during meetings when she was alive. C'mon, give me a break. Or some of the situations just weren't explained or didn't make sense. Why put people's E.T.D. on a sticky note?

On top of that, there are just way too many logistical and plot holes that make this already poorly written show drop dead bad. I know people are going to say but it's just a show (or no way this can't be true) but when you pay good money to watch or own this show you should be warned up front that a combination of some Bigwigs at Showtime along with a new writer from an Ivy League school doesn't equal success or original writing.",1110067200,19,1048,4.37948717948718

It was great - one of the best series ever on tv right up there with all the great shows in cable series format. For example: Nikita even though DLM it wasn't all action all the time, in it's own way it was just as good as any other hit cable show. So where's the second season my money is in my hand ready to buy?

So I only tend to watch sitcoms, I don't enjoy CSI like stuff either. Watched some promos about the show and that they made some fun of afterlife...uhmmm, everyone wants to know something about after life, I knew already that I would not find no answer there, but at least I will have the chance to see other's view of the issue.

Watched the pilot with this thin/strange voiced girl and got shocked/hooked very very badly. Every chapter made you think about the afterlife but was funny at the same time. I even enjoyed more the 2nd season, it is better ellaborated than in the first one, and the cast looked way more integrated.

This series really deserves a third/closing season.

One thing that this show leaves on you is that you only have a live, even if there is an afterlife after all, you only have one chance to live it.",1109289600,17,1027,4.305699481865285

It's an amazing show, and the only show I've ever been interested enough in to watch every week.  Stereotypical characters? -- Everyone in the world follows a stereotype.  The quality of the show is that the characters are normal people with normal problems.  Some of the scenes dealing with George's family are the most poignant -- especially if one has experienced similar situations in their own life. You can relate to it.  DLM shows the psychological aspects of people and their relationships with each other.  Season 2 is better because it develops some the threads introduced in season 1.  Everyone I've shared DLM with, loves it.  I guess there are some people out there who are unable to appreciate a show that operates on multiple levels because their intellect has been dulled by dumbed-down television.",1109203200,8,907,4.882352941176471

2001252,3,B0001GF2F6,"Dead like me is a show positively brimming over with wasted potential.

They begin with a good concept, that the afterlife is run like a bureaucracy, but grim reapers don't get paid and thus must seek additional employment. This leads to some pretty good scenes, such as Roxy's job as a Meter Maid (always entertaining to watch) and George's job at Happy Time Temp Agency. Of all the different segments, the Happy Time ones are the best-Dolores Herbig, George's boss, is one of those characters who seems nice but along the way constantly reveales incredibly disturbing things about herself. Crystal the Receptionist is always funny, usually nothing more than a glaring pair of eyes staring across the reception desk.

The other segments of the show not directly involved in reaping, the interaction of George's sister Reggie and her mother Joy, are a pain to watch. They litterally do nothing but bicker with one another episode after episode-after all this fighting, one presumes, these segments must eventually lead to something, have some purpose, right? You would think so, but they don't. They have no point and go nowhere. You could excise these segments from the show entirely and it would be the better for it.

Finally we come to the heart of the show, which deals with the actual reaping of souls. These segments could have been best of all; indeed, they could have made this show a real gem but the writers dropped the ball on this one, too. Firstly, the gravelings. These little creatures supposedly run around causing accidents that kill people, but these creatures are the show's greatest flaw. Not only do they cause some really ludicrous death scenes, but they completely ruin the mystery and randomness of death in favor of a few cheap sight gags. Secondly, the plot holes: they establish right off the bat that the undead reapers look different to the living so they won't be recognized. George's undead persona, Millie, looks like a crack whore. But they continually forget this very important plot point again and again. They never mention their undead appearances after the first few episodes. This show could have been very good, it certainly has some good moments, but unfortunately it is as stiff and lifeless as its subject matter.",1108771200,13,2257,4.934210526315789
2001253,2,B0001GF2F6,"When you watch a series from a cable network (HBO, Showtime, etc.) you expect good quality writing, originality and a somewhat entertaining show. With Dead Like Me, you don't get any of these things. But hear me out - First of all, this series is definitely geared towards girls between the ages of 17-20 (trust me on this). But regardless of this, there were so many clichs, unoriginal jokes, and just boring writing that this series was very hard to watch.

On top of the awful writing, the characters were incredibly annoying, shallow and just hard to relate or even care for in this show. As one reviewer stated, all your typical characters are in this show - Jaded, don't smile, fish-out-of-water teen girl, your foreigner (not the band) lad, the cheesy sex-pot, cheating husband, etc...

The jokes and storylines were either so boring, ripped off from something else (especially American Beauty for the mother, father and little sister storyline), or so filled with plot holes that you spent more time getting annoyed by this than actually enjoying the show. For example:  Girls that have boy names, thinking the word ""moist"" is pornographic or gross, main character narrating to the viewer (I never understood this technique and it sort of  questions the viewer's intelligence - can you say ""Malcolm In The Middle""),  etc.

I give Showtime credit for taking a chance on this show (maybe trying to compete with HBO's Six Feet Under) but there are too many plot and logistical flaws and holes for the idea of this show. Showtime should have backed out of this project or at least hired better writers.",1108339200,14,1606,4.843065693430657
2001254,5,B0001GF2F6,"I love Dead Like Me and this product is perfect for those of us who don't have Showtime, but have seen and fallen in love with the show at a friends house. I recieved this DVD set as a gift and I love it.

Dead Like Me is a show about Georgia (aka George, Millie, Toilet Seat Girl, Peanut etc) and the experience of her death. George is (was) an 18 year old who, after dropping out of college her first semester moves back in with her parents and kid sister. Upon being nagged by her mother to get a job, George begins clerical work at a place called Happy Time. On her first day working at Happy Time she goes out of the office to grab a quick lunch when she encounters a man on the street who asks her name and touches her when she walks away, then she gets hit in the head with a toilet seat which fell from space and dies... sounds weird but it's well done.

Right after her death George realizes that she has not left the earth, and is confused by this. She ends up meeting some Grim Reapers, Rube being the boss (played by Mandy Patakin), and they explain to her that she is dead and that she is to be a Grim Reaper. Rube explains that when you die and you weren't a good person, nor a bad person you have to become a Reaper for sometime until you fill your Quota of souls. So what George's job as a Reaper is that she must take the souls out of people who are about to die accidential\painful deaths so that that person will feel no pain. Rube gives this particular group of Reapers their assignments daily, which consist of enitials, and address, and an E.T.D. (estimated time of death) and the Reapers are to find this person and take their soul out of their bodies.

You might be wondering how she can walk around the same city she was living in without some people knowing her, this is covered, in this show the dead take on different names to the public (George is Millie) and they look very different to the living.

The show follows George as she gets used to the fact that she is dead, and her coping with the fact that being dead doesn't change the fact that she now needs a place to ""live"" (which the Reapers show her that she can inhabit the apartments of dead people who no one knew were dead yet), and the fact that she needs to get a real world job (which she happens to go back to Happy Time). The Reapers are all friendly with each other and hang together in a diner.

The show also deals with George's family and how they deal with her loss. Her mom, who never really got along with George is extreamly guilty, her little sister who George always ignored misses her more than anyone, and her dad privatly grieves. George, looking different is able to have somewhat regular encounters with members of her family, and she finds out some family secrets which explain alot of the relationship problems her parents have.

This show is great. It is funny and sad all at once. I guess some would call it dark comedy. The cast is incredibly talented and make the show that much more fun to watch. The DVD set is packaged nicely and the special features are fun.",1106697600,12,3077,4.242320819112628
2001255,5,B0001GF2F6,"The characters are rich and complex, the writing is amazing, and the shots and visuals are mind-boggling. You really cannot compare this show to Six Feet Under. To me, Six Feet Under is like a Soap Opera full of characters I could care less about.  All of the characters and situation in Dead Like Me are right on.

I have watched this DVD so many times it is scary!  I'm hooked, my sister and brother in law are hooked, and all the friends I have showed it to are hooked.  One problem - they really have some chutzpah to have almost an entire episode be flashbacks when they hadn't even been on for a season.  Also, some of the rules of the grim reapers that they talk about in the first episode don't hold up as the show goes on. Surprising and Shocking!",1105488000,9,756,4.258741258741258
2001256,5,B0001GF2F6,"The ""other"" dead show?  What a perverse perspective.  In my opinion, this is easily the best series I have watched.  It works on every level -  it is smart, poignant, funny, sad, profound, unpredictable, and amazingly entertaining.  The actors and actresses are very well cast, and the plots are never boring.  The characters are very believable, and the dry, smart humor never goes into the predictable cliches that have become the staple of most sitcoms.

This show is so funny and moving, often at the same time, it becomes difficult to even watch other shows.  It also dances along the delicate line of having a message without being preachy.  The dialogue is superb, spoken with perfect timing by excellent actors.  Callum Blue and Ellen Muth could make an ill-humored mailbox laugh, although that could probably said to a lesser degree about all the actors in the show.

If you are sick of bland, derivative, childish sitcoms, then get this DVD.  I can not imagine anyone being disappointed in it.

This is an addendum to my initial review.  Recently, I had someone visit from Florida who I wanted to show this series to.  She showed absolutely no interest in it, despite my telling her how incredible this series was. She was very reluctant to watch even one show, but I knew she would like it so I persisted in trying.  Eventually I managed to get her to watch an episode.  After that, whenever she would come over she would ask to see more and each night would watch a couple of episodes until it was time to leave.  When she finally went back to Florida she said she was going to buy the DVD set for herself.  She said she loved the show and found the characters all very likeable and believable, and enjoyed the interactions between them very much.  This show is so good one has no doubt that people will like it.  I never had any at all, it was just a matter of getting her to watch one episode.",1105142400,16,1907,4.5337243401759535

Every character reveals things about themselves as the shows progress and I think it's that that draws you in and fascinates you.  They are such an eclectic group of people you know there is no other possible situation that would have drawn them together except for something as unusual as this.

I really like this series. It's a well written (well acted) show about the lighter side of death. Or ""life after life."" Is there an afterlife? For these reapers, there is. They become cosmic temps, taking souls (those who's time has come) until they too can move on....eventually (or so they hope). Somehow, they manage to make this more funny than morbid. Though the concept seems pretty depressing, it's both sad at times, and incredibly amusing. That's a great combination to me. Laughter thru misty eyes. Kind of makes you appreciate those in your life that are important. And serves as a not-so-subtle reminder not to take them for granted. So far, only 2 seasons have been made (and only one of those available on dvd to date) and no word as of yet about a 3rd season. (I hope they make a 3rd season!)",1101427200,9,881,4.611464968152866
2001268,5,B0001GF2F6,"A friend once told me that he was creeped out whenever an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" featured a ventriloquist's dummy. Those episodes never impressed me, but recently I got chills watching an old episode about a toy telephone.

You can never tell what's going to strike a chord and resonate with a particular person. ""Dead Like Me"" is not for everyone. Some people will hate it. Others just won't ""get"" it. It's too bad, really, because they're missing out on something truly wonderful.

18-year-old Georgia (George) Lass, deceased, has a new job: collector of souls of the newly departed--a grim reaper, if you prefer. She doesn't want to be a reaper. She doesn't know how to be a reaper. She gets on-the-job training. What she learns about, mostly, is life.

In life, George was too cool to care about anything. In death, she learns to care, in ways that are funny and sad together. The result is the most consistently moving television show I've ever seen. At the end of each episode, when the credits appear, I find myself shaking my head and muttering, ""What a GREAT show!""

The language and some visuals are too harsh for young children. The show contains a lot of adult subject matter--no, not like cable porn--rather, like parents struggling over how to cope with an emotionally troubled 11-year-old daughter. Material for genuinely mature audiences. Very rare, that.

Not for everyone, but I couldn't recommend it more highly. What a GREAT show.",1100995200,42,1458,4.862903225806452
2001269,5,B0001GF2F6,"My partner and friends think I'm perverse, but I love Dead Like Me and find every episode hilarious.  I suppose one could take it seriously and then perhaps be sad or offended, but it would be pretty tough to actually think that someone could be killed by a toilet seat falling from space or that Death has minions who go around taking the souls of people whose names are doled out to them on Post-It notes.

Yet Dead Like Me does work as a ""straight"" plot (more or less) and that's one of the things I love about it. The fact that the shows cast and crew offer this stuff up with a straight face just makes it all the more funny.  And it's what gives the characters enough depth and credibility to make the viewer care about them. From the lead ""reaper,"" Georgia, to her dweeb mother, Joy, to her fellow reaper, the former actress Daisy, the characters are both unique and believeable.

My favorite is Delores Herbig, Georgia's boss at Happy Time Employment Agency. Check out the episode where George visits Delores at her apartment. Even though it's a studio, Delores proudly shows George around the place, stopping at the ""scrapbooking"" area and showing her the cat's ""feeding station.""  The satire rolls down the walls.  And some of the other character's at Happy Time are also hilarious, like the creepy receptionist, Crystal.  Trust me, you will choke with laughter.",1100649600,12,1372,4.668049792531121
2001270,5,B0001GF2F6,"After the unwanted demise of Buffy the Vampire Slayer as a primetime television phenomenon...many fans needed some place to go.  Believe it or not, a large group of them went to the quirky, poignant Showtime smash, Dead Like Me.

The previous review did an excellent job in detailing the plot so I won't go into that.  I will, however, talk about the impact the show had on me.

Personally, I am afraid of death, as many people probably are.  The Bible talks about the same ideas that are present in the show, that your soul is removed before you feel any pain, so that death isn't...well, painful.  It's comforting to see this in a show.

Outside of that, this show astounds me every time I watch it.  When Season 1 had aired on Showtime, I didn't get to see the entire thing but I knew I wanted it when it came out on DVD.  I finally bought it, watched the entire thing (sometimes episodes twice in a row before moving on) and I just couldn't get enough.

Ellen Muth's portrayal of George is jaw-dropping.  She so adequately expresses her lack of caring, her sarcasm, her wit, and her internal beauty in every episode.  She truly carries the show in many ways none of the other actors could if they were the lead.  I love finding out more about George, and I get miffed if something happens to her or someone upsets her.  I always find myself siding with her.

In the beginning, Rube seems a nice paternal character but as the show progresses...I find myself very annoyed with him and above all else I would prefer to see him get what's coming to him.

The only other character that pulls any thoughts out of me is Daisy.  I find it amusing the amount of crap she puts the others through, and where her head exactly is that she cares as little as she does.  Like she is still unwilling to accept her position as a reaper.  She is just as indignant as George, constantly trying to push the envelope...but she always has this air of...""I am better than you"" that George (thankfully) doesn't have.  It's frustrating to watch.

Simply put, this show is AMAZING!  And the best way to bring it back to earth is George's family.  Their lives are normal, everyday, where George's are not.  It's a nice contrast, and it's interesting to see Reggie's development as a character.  Joy pissed me off in the beginning but I am growing constantly more fond of her, just to have it ripped away by another thing she's said to George in the past.  It's all so...real, so riveting.  I can't get enough of the show.  I really can't.",1100390400,9,2515,4.444201312910285

I really thought I would dislike this series and got hooked to the point that I want to get the set to own. I haven't seen the 2nd season but I hear that ""lesson learned"" concept isn't apparent in season 2. Great acting! It's weird seeing Jasmine Guy play like a Wanda Sykes character.

Too bad that the show's creator left the show for creative reasons. He apparently had fought Showtime because they wanted the show to be more like 'Touched By An Angel' (happy endings, lesson learned, etc).

After Bryan Fuller left, the storyline of George's father being Gay was completely changed among other things. You'll notice episode 1 when her father hugs the other guy in George's funeral. You'll also notice that after episode 5 or so the tone/direction of the show changed.

In the affirmative, like any good dram-edy, or co-ma, (1) the characers are witty, (2) the story-line is interesting, and (3) the situations dance on the pin head of a needle.  But, what really makes this show worth watching is (4) George (Ellen Muth) dealing with her afterlife and family and (5) how her family copes with her death as individuals and as a family.  A good supporting cast and sub-plots help round out why I like this show.  In the negative, (1) this is an ""R""-rated show dealing with sensitive issues and questioning various belief systems: death, the afterlife, ghosts/spirits, good/evil, etc.  I have no problem with sensitive issues or belief questioning, what I don't like is (2) the abundant use of profanity; and (3) some loose ends encountered in the main and sub plots.  Hopefully, in regards to the loose ends, the second season will take care of them.  As for the rest, I hope the language gets cleaned up.  Overall, this is an ""R"" show for language and thematic content, so treat it accordingly, especially, if you have young family members.

You've seen it before in ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Heaven Can Wait"". Which is not to say that ""Dead Like Me"" is a ripoff of those movies -- it does have its own ideas. The most important of these is that the dead souls drafted as ""Reapers"" don't get paid, and have to earn a living (one of many such ironies) in various low-profile, and therefore low-paid jobs. It's amusing, and well-acted, but after a while you sort of wonder why George and her team never really have to deal with really nasty, unpleasant death.

This series takes a unique approach to the afterlife ... where Grim Reapers exist to ""pop"" one's soul before they come to a painful untimely end. The show wisely avoids religious issues, instead it focuses on the characters and the situations that they are presented with.

One of the many humourous deaths in the show.  And she enters the new world of being a grim reaper.  Which is a ""public service"" by the way.

Among the reapers are Rube, who loves food to the point of obsession and is the father figure guy.  There is the brit, Mason who is a drug addict and has no qualms with stealing from the dead.  There is Daisy, who replaces a reaper friend of Georgia's  Daisy is a stuck up southern belle who talks about ""blowing"" varius famous me all the time.  There are a few more interesting character, such as the gravelings, who set death into motion and can only be seen by the undead out of the corner of their eyes.

Georgia has a hard time coping with her death and other emotions.  Among her adventures are trying to go home again, saving the lives of people she's supposed to take the souls from (leading to harsh consequences), finding a day job, and quitting her day job.)

Like Six Feet Under (its more cerebral counterpart on HBO) the characters interact with their dead counterparts to examine and, in some cases, resolve their own issues, and the writing and execution/acting are superb in every episode.

This is definitely not one to share with the kids, though.  The language in this series and the themes are adults-only, so watch blissfully after you've tucked the kids in for the night.  This is a great deal and you will not regret the purchase.",1095811200,6,874,4.8

2001285,5,B0001GF2F6,"George Lass ( Ellen Muth) is an 18 year old girl with no ambition in life. She still lives at home with her parents, and dropped out of college after half a semester. Her mother wants her to make more of her life, and forces George to find a job. Soon George manages to find a job as a file clerk, only to be killed on her lunch break by a falling toilet seat from a space station that exploded. George is not allowed to move on to the afterlife and is forced to become a grim reaper that takes the souls of the living just before they pass over. She is slowly broken into the business by the lead reaper Rube (Mandy Patkin)and is given advice from fellow reapers at a local waffle house that the group meets at everyday to receive their assignments. But, just when George thought that things could not get any worse, she soon discovers that being a reaper does not entitle her to a free ride. She is forced to find a day job in between reaps, a place to stay, and learn all the things about life that she never knew when she was alive.

Right off the bat I would like to say that Dead Like Me is probably one of the most addictive, well written, and funniest shows on television today. There have been films and television shows that concentrate on the afterlife before. However, Dead Like Me takes an original apporach to the subject. The show not only focuses on George and her fellow reapers taking people's souls before they pass over, but on their daily lives in between reaps as well. The reapers are forced to get day jobs and find places to stay. The most ironic thing about the show is that George is forced to take care of herself and learns more about life when she is dead, then she did when she was alive. Another aspect of the show that I like, is the fact that the appearances of the reapers are changed to the world around them, to keep the reapers from being recognized by people that they knew when they were alive. This plays into the other focus of the show which is on George's disfunctional family and how they handle life after George passed on.

Overall Dead Like Me is an amazing show, and I guarantee that once you start watching you will not want to stop. It usually takes me at least a week to go through a full season on DVD, but I went through all 14 episodes of Dead Like Me in just two days. The writing, performances, and non stop laughs drag you in and keep you there.

A solid 5 stars...",1095292800,10,2423,4.228941684665227
2001286,5,B0001GF2F6,"I am sure the people at Showtime knew what they were doing when they scheduled ""Dead Like Me"" to start when HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" was over, because the two shows are certainly complementary.  However, while the deaths that begin each episode of ""Six Feet Under"" have their moments in terms of being rather weird (my favorite was the woman convinced it was the Rapture when she saw the a bunch of helium filled inflatable dolls floating away), they do not have the Rube Goldberg quality of what the gravelings can set in motion in ""Dead Like Me.""

The idea of the afterlife created by Bryan Fuller, who also created the similarly quirky Wonderfalls,"" is that right before you die you soul is taken from your body by a Grim Reaper.  Although they are replete in the opening title sequence these are not Grim Reapers as in figures in black hood carrying scythes.  In fact, they look like regular folk, although not the regular folk they were when they were alive now that they are a peculiar variety of undead.  We learn the rules of the game along with young Georgia Lass (Ellen Muth), an 18-year-old sourpuss called George.  Having decided to forego the college experience George has been sent out into the world to find a job and during lunch she is passed on the street by a strange man who touches her.  We see a light passing from her to him and within seconds a toilet seat from a disintegrating Russian space station strikes her dead.

George is surprised to see herself looking at the big hole in the ground where she had been standing a moment ago and even more surprised to be informed that she is now a Grim Reaper.  This task is done by Rube (Mandy Patinkin), who is in charge of a cadre of Reapers in this particular town.  This includes Mason (Callum Blue), an English bloke who has figured out that you cannot overdose when you are already dead so indulge in drugs to your heart's contextt; Roxy (Jasmine Guy), a meter maid for the police department with ample attitude to spare; and, at first,  Betty Rhomer (Rebecca Gayheart), a former beauty queen who is ready to move on to the next level.  We are not quite sure what that is, because while Grim Reapers get to release souls and head them in the right direction (bright lights that assume various pleasing shapes), they really do not know what the final destination is really like for the dead.

Of course, in the early episodes of the series George is not happy with being dead and not exactly thrilled with a job when she is given a post-it note with a name, address and E.T.D. (estimated time of death) so she can go reap a soul.  The latter is taken care of when she gets a couple of hard lessons about what happens when she does not (your form in the afterlife is not how you look at the moment of death, but at the moment that your soul is reaped, so it is something you would want to have done before the autopsy).  The former is more difficult, because trying to reconnect with her life from beyond the grave is hampered by the fact that she looks different (to everyone else) and she cannot say anything that would convince anyone who knew her before that she was still around.

One of the strengths of this quirky series is that we do not ignore the family that Georgia has left behind as her mother (Cynthia Stevenson), little sister (Britt McKillip), and father (Greg Kean) try to deal with moving on after her death.  Watching the Lass family disintegrate is almost a show within the show, capable of standing on its own, because their interaction with Georgia the Grim Reaper is infrequent and usually something indirect.  We are as interested in what is going to happen to Joy and Reggie (and J.D. rather than Clancy) as we are to Georgia and her friends.

Another thing that makes ""Dead Like Me"" work is the actual friendship that springs up between George and Dolores Herbig (Christine Willes).  Now known as Millie, George ends up going back to work at Happy Time, the employment agency that she was taking a lunch break from when the sky fell on her head (even when you are undead a girl has to eat).  Dolores is extremely annoying, but ""Millie"" pretends to play along so long that she actually starts playing along with Dolores' weltanschauung.

The cherry on top with this show is Mandy Patinkin as Rube, who finally has a role in which he can say pretty much anything he wants, especially when it comes to what he is having for breakfast and how it is cooked.  I like the way he calls George ""Peanut"" all the time as he imparts to her the facts of being undead.  I also like the way Roxy gets mad at people who tear up their tickets, the moments of conscious that Mason has when doing his job, and the way Reggie honors the memory of her sister.  But then it is a well- established fact that I like quirky.

Joining the cast during this first season is another Grim Reaper, Daisy Adair (Laura Harris), an actress who had a role in ""Gone With the Wind"" and makes no bones about how she got the gig before she died.  She and George become roommates just to cause further trouble for our heroine (and her frog) and is most definitely the character who rubs me the wrong way.  But in the end I have to say that the only thing about ""Dead Like Me"" that really bothers me is that the post-it notes only have the first initial of the person who is destined to die.  You cannot tell a person's gender from just an initial.",1095033600,122,5404,4.430303030303031
2001287,4,B0001GF2F6,"The clerk in our local video store told me about this series, and I have to admit it's addictive.  Dead Like Me has all the ingredients of a successful non-traditional series: great acting, fascinating individual characters, fast-moving scenes, likeable but complex lead characters, and an offbeat premise.  Selecting a new episode is like looking forward to a reunion with old friends.  So I'd enthusiastically recommend this series to anyone who wants to escape from restrictive, me-too network programming.

Reapers are people who have died but are not ready to move to the ultimate heavenly bliss. Apparently others are, because some of the newly dead get to ascend filmy staircases that presumably lead to better ends.  While waiting to move on, reapers are assigned a quota of souls to pull from bodies of people who have just died.

Rube, played perfectly by Mandy Patinkin, gets names delivered in an envelope, slid under his door. He distributes assignments on yellow post-it notes.  He's a combination of coach, father-figure and boss: kind but tough. His crew (as others noted already) includes an irreverent English druggie, a former actress, a cynical meter maid and of course George, the 18-year-old with an attitude.

Two aspects of the show stopped me from awarding Dead Like Me five stars. First, as others have noted, the show's premise contains inherent contradictions. Reapers have physical bodies that digest food, but presumably they don't age. Reapers travel, drive cars, get apartments and take jobs, but where do they get documents and licenses?  And if they hang around for years, presumably they'd grow in knowledge and wisdom.  And as a career consultant, I resist the notion of afterlife as a series of dreary day jobs.  If the Reapers maintain their pre-death attitudes, they'll outgrow those jobs, become overqualified and even get promoted in spite of themselves.

Second, Dead Like Me inevitably reminds viewers of other shows.  There's an obvious comparison to Six Feet Under, where the dead occasionally leap to life to send a message to the Fisher family.  The coffee shop scenes evoke memories of Seinfeld and of course Sex and the City. And hovering over the series is the ghost of Charlie's Angels, where a kindly man dishes out assignments to an unlikely crew.

To some extent, you can enjoy the comparisons as satire. Sex and the City had an over-the-top publication party; Dead Like Me, an over-the-top employee farewell party.  Charlie's Angels were beautiful obedient young women; this crew is...well, different.
Most of the characters in Dead Like Me seem deliberately overdrawn, especially Dolores, George's employer, and Reggie, George's younger sister. But the show takes away its own satiric edge by allowing us to see a sympathetic side of each character. Dolores crumples when her cat gets sick. Roxy mourns her dance career. And we learn that Daisy was sadly lonely in her former life.

Unlike some reviewers, I enjoyed the scenes with George's own family. They're more complex than we first realize and it's hard to categorize them as ""good"" or ""bad.""  And it's more fascinating to watch the worlds of the dead and the living come together, rather than stay within the stifling world of the dead.

Despite these reservations, I'll be first in line to watch Season 2 on DVD...hopefully soon.",1094947200,4,3343,5.089743589743589
2001288,5,B0001GF2F6,"I don't buy television series' to keep in my DVD collection. Especially series that have just been released after their first season. I don't own any Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs (although the show has some great acting and dialogue), nor do I own Six Feet Under or The Sopranos or any other form of long term television viewing. So what makes this one so different?

Simply put: everything!

In a time where most of what we see and understand comes through that little lighted box with a remote control near-at-hand, it is refreshing to see something different. Something unlike what Hollywood would normally put out there. I can almost hear the arguments against this show before it was released (probably similar arguments that got Wonder Falls cancelled...another excellent show with the same production crew, so I understand). ""Death! Who wants to hear about the afterlife of an 18 year old girl?!"" and ""This family is too dysfunctional!"" and ""Comedy. We need more comedy!"" Let's hope some do-gooder never get's his/her hands on this excellent story concept and tries to change it to a light-hearted, feel-good series or some other ridiculously overdone theme.

So what is this series about? The focus is on Georgia ""George"" Lass, played perfectly by Ellen Muth. She's like millions of other post-highschool graduates out there; she has no idea what she wants to do with her life, or whether she wants to do anything at all. Her mother, Joy (Cynthia Stevenson), is fed up with her daughter's attitude and forces her out of bed one fateful morning with harsh words and orders for her to ""find a job and become a productive member of society."" Little does George's mother know, but these harsh words will be the last she ever speaks to her eldest daughter. On George's first day in the workforce, she takes a lunch break and, as she stand on a street corner, gets snuffed out by a zero-G toilet seat that comes crashing into our atmosphere from the disintegrating Mir space station. But before she's killed, a nice black man asks her name and touches her on the back ever so slightly. George has just been Reaped. The toilet seat kills her, but her soul lives on. Rube (Mandy Patinkin) greets her as her new boss. George is to become a Grim Reaper, taking souls from the lives of those that are about to be violently ended.

The irony is smackingly wonderful: a young girl who couldn't have cared less about her own life only moments before is now in charge of the end of lives of god knows how many people. Leaving behind her family is tough, though. And it is poignantly portrayed without getting heavy-handed in the dialogue department. Her mother retreats into herself and becomes an angry woman who likes very little. George's kid sister, Reggie (Britt McKillip), tries to contact George in the afterlife by acting out (she steals toilet seats from her school, uses a Ouji board on top of her own toilet seat in an effort to hear anything coming from the `beyond', and collects dead things like birds). George's father, Clancy Lass (Greg Kean), has an affair with one of his graduate students.

What George hadn't anticipated either was the fact that her life has/had actual meaning. She witnesses her family falling apart but is unable to do anything about it. She also has to work a regular job now (Reapers don't get paid by some surreal agency), as well as do the reaping assignments handed out to her by Rube.

Within this little grouping of Reapers are some outstanding personalities, too. Callum Blue plays Mason, a Reaper who died while drilling a hole into his head in the 1960's in an attempt to reach ""the ultimate high."" He'll do anything not to work, including stealing from those who he reaps and carrying ""illegals in his bottom."" Jasmine Guy plays Roxy, a tough and roughshod Reaper who doesn't take anything from anyone. She'd been murdered over money. No wonder she wants to be cop. Laura Harris plays Daisy Adair, a pretty, young actress who knew and had sex with almost all the early movie stars. She's been around the block, trying to find love and acceptance. It's a funny and sad character that comes barreling off the screen.

The thing that'll pull you into this series is the dialogue and the characters. The death of an 18 year old girl and her subsequent enlistment into Reaper-ville can sound rather heavy. And it is. But the writers let that seep into the story and don't force it upon us (not an easy thing to do). The comedy is spot on and never slapstick or inappropriate. I let my teenagers watch a couple of the series and they were laughing out loud many times, and reaching for tissues at the more poignant moments; a testament to a great show if ever there was one (being able to hold the attention of the instant gratification age).

I cannot recommend this series highly enough. I pray that Showtime keeps getting the go-ahead to continue the show. So far, season 2 has been outstanding too. Bravo!",1094601600,17,4947,4.704387990762124

2001290,2,B0001GF2F6,"It amazes me how universal the praise is for this show. I wonder if I even saw the same show as everyone else, because the show I saw was a disappointing collection of cliched dialog, stock characters and a plot that felt so contrived I just couldn't get into it.

Just so you know where I am coming from, my favorite TV shows of the moment are 'Aqua Teen Hunger Force', 'Da Ali G Show', 'Six Feet Under', 'Strangers With Candy', 'My So Called Life' and 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'. Compared to those shows, 'Dead Like Me' is quite simply mediocre.

The characters are cliched beyond belief...you have the gruff, man of few words(played by Mandy Patinkin), you have your sassy black woman (Jasmine Guy), wacky idiosynchratic english accented 20-something man, and your sullen 18 year old. Really nothing new here at all as far as character types.

The dialog is even worse. Frequent voiceovers are provided to describe things we can see with our own eyes.  Conversations between characters are awkward in a badly directed way, rather than in a 'this is how people really speak' way. And, in my opinion the actors are all overacting their parts. Worst of all, conversations were frequently accompanied by a soundtrack as if the producers lacked confidence in the power of the dialog to stand on its own.

Perhaps worst of all, I just found the entire concept of the show to be annoying. I can enjoy fantasy scenarios (like Firefly), but this one is just too far fetched and idiotic. If someone has already died, I'm not sure I understand why it is so crucial that they earn money to eat? Are they going to starve and die -- again? I accept plot holes, but this show had so many illogical plot contrivances that I just could not accept the entire concept of the show.

The show seems to have its devoted followers, but let my opinion be a warning that this show is NOT universally loved by all who see it.",1094169600,22,1898,4.567647058823529
2001291,5,B0001GF2F6,"I purchased this series, knowing nothing about it other than reading the rave reviews here on Amazon.  Thanks everyone!

A couple of reviewers said things like ""buy this if you liked Buffy"" which is a comment sure to get my attention.  But the only similarity is that they are both wonderfully written and acted shows.  This is poignant drama, with a touch of humour, and whilst the premise is a fantasy, it is a fantasy dealing with some very real issues (okay, maybe a few surreal ones too).  In part the series is about the ways in which people and families deal with death, but at its core it is a hopeful and positive story with characters you come to care a lot about, especially the main character brilliantly played by Ellen Muth.

My wife occasionly gets exasperated by my habit of buying DVDs almost sight unseen.  And yet now, this is her favourite TV show (this will get me points back for some of the duds I've wasted money on!).  Our teenage children also enjoy it immensely (it has some language and themes that might worry some parents, but in my opinion it is overall a positive experience even for younger teens).  I'm just surprised it ever got put on TV - it seems much too intelligent to survive in the current reality-schlock environment.",1093824000,10,1260,4.564444444444445

2001293,5,B0001GF2F6,"A very good Chicago friend (Hi, David!) recommended this boxed set to us, saying that we would enjoy the program, but he kept his fingers crossed because, well, it is not automatically the kind of show you'd recommend to just everyone.  It is for acquired tastes only.  Indeed we were put off by the across-the-board profanity on the part of all the characters at first (after awhile we got used to it, denatured I suppose, or else maybe as the series goes on the characters swear less and less), it doesn't seem so much naturalistic as it does the producers just deciding to show you how much foul language they could get away with on cable on TV.  Thus the leading lady, in particular, young Ellen Muth, is saddled with some of the most gamy dialogue I've heard outside of the work of Pierre Guyotat.

But outside of that, the show really grows on you.  Muth is so odd you can't take your eyes off of her, sometimes she looks bruised as though she'd been beaten up, it's hard to figure out her age, but when they dress her up and make her up right, she looks like a cross between Sandra Dee and Brigitte Bardot.  Her mother, the admirable Cynthia Stevenson, is stuck with a two-note role that sometimes seems arbitrarily laced into the action of the various episodes, because as the show progresses, out attention drifts away from the grief of the Lass family and into the other areas of George's life.

Did anyone think the show is paying a kind of muted homage to the Glass family of J D Salinger?  Remember when George got fingered by the Reapers, and the name on her post it note was: ""G.LASS""?  It's funny how her father, Clancy the professor, on his office door the plaque says, ""C.LASS""!

The principle character, George (played by Ellen Muth) dies via a toilet seat that falls out of space from the Russian space station. However, instead of passing into heaven as most dead people do, she becomes a grim reaper who joins a group of reapers assigned to violent deaths (murders, suicides, etc.).

The show uses her 'job' as a jumping off point to explore some darker themes. A lovers death driving a man to suicide, for example. It also hits on more mundane facts of life, like George looking for a day job to support her self. Reapers gotta eat too, you know.

The best part about the show is that it never loses its sense of humor, even in the darkest of moments. It's very refreshing to see a show that can handle both humor and drama. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD set!",1092268800,3,977,4.4525139664804465

I definitely like the widescreen picture.  There is some occasional swearing. Sex and violence is about the same as you would see on primetime tv.

1. Pilot (2 hours):  A young woman discovers that she has been assigned a job in the afterlife as a Reaper.

2. Dead Girl Walking:  George finds that shirking her duties has consequences for the souls.

3. Curious George:  George has trouble letting go of the past.

4. Reapercussions:  George learns a lesson when she tries to spare a soul.

5. Reaping Havoc:  A new friend jumps to the other side.

6. My Room:  George gets a new roommate after losing her friend.

7. Reaper Madness:  George has an affair with a living schizophrenic who can see her.

2001297,4,B0001GF2F6,"This is a wonderful show. It's funny, it's great to watch, and it's just such a cool concept. Gives a new perspective on life and death. George is a really believable character. She's easy to relate to. She can't really grasp the reaper thing at first, she has a hard time leaving her family, and doesn't always do the right thing. She's a really great character and makes the show seem very real. The others aren't nearly as complex as her, but in each episode we see the characters develop. When Daisy is first introduced, she seems really bubbley, (...)happy and a stereotypical blonde. But then we see more in depth and that she is sad and real in later episodes. Same with Roxy, who at first seems sort of cold and uncaring about anything. But as the show develops, how she saved the one guy who she liked, and how she felt bad about her death, she gets a little more life. All of them do. Just like real people. At first people seem really one dimensional, but everybody has problems and emotions that take some time to notice. I love the character development in this show.

 Overall, Dead Like Me is really well-acted, funny and real. It's unlike a lot of television these days and it's refreshing. There's not a lot of romance, there's just people. The undead seem more like real people than most of the people on television. It's a good show, one of the best I've seen.

 One star was taken off because this isn't a flawless show. The special effects are really bad, and some of the things that happen are too out there and just not believable. I don't like the home stuff with the Lass family all that well. The mom is very annoying, Clancy is okay and Reggie is a bit too weird that she's not really that believable anymore. Also Delores is too far out there to believe. Things like George's going away party at work and the way a lot of the people die seem too far-fetched for me. Also when George died, she acted like a real person would. Really confused and angry and then just kind of pissed off. None of the other people who die seem to care that much. They just think ""Hey I'm dead, going to the afterlife now. Cool."" And characters just seem to disappear, as well as things that happen, from episode to episode. Like what happened to Charlotte? It loses some of the magic of the show, I think. But it's still, besides Scrubs and Freaks and Geeks, probably one of my favorite shows of all time.",1091750400,5,2412,4.401345291479821
2001298,5,B0001GF2F6,"I recently purchased the DVD set for this show because I do not subscribe to Showtime. I finished watching all 14 episodes in 1 weekend and I have to say, the show was better than I ever expected! This cant even be compared to Six Feet Under because Dead Like Me on a completely different level! If you don't want to wait until June 2005 to see the second season on DVD, you'll have to subscribe to Showtime. It will be well worth the extra money.",1091750400,4,447,4.209302325581396
2001299,4,B0001GF2F6,"Any fears I had about ""Dead Like Me"" being nothing more than a way for Showtime to cash in on the success and brilliance of HBO's extraordinary ""Six Feet Under"" series were quickly laid to rest (pun intended) when I sunk my teeth into this well-acted, entertaining and quirky series. ""Dead Like Me"" proposes that souls not evil enough for hell or evolved enough for heaven become employed as Grim Reapers in the afterlife, put to work extracting the souls from people right before their moment of death, and then guiding them into their personal afterlife (which usually ingeniously takes the form of whatever they imagine bliss to be). The Reapers themselves are all deeply flawed, and yet likeable, characters who have passed away at different points in time, and who have to pay their karmic debt by doing the job until the Almighty judges that they've ""met their quota"". The main character, George, played with loads of charm and poise by the young Ellen Muth, is a rebellious, lazy teenager who, despite the rules against it, still watches over her mourning, dysfunctional family. The great Mandy Patinkin plays the Grim Reaper ""manager"" Rube, and also serves as father figure and mentor to George, goofy British hoodlum Mason, angry meter maid Roxy (the sexy and talented Jasmine Guy) and vain, self-absorbed Daisy. Although the emphasis is mostly on quirky comedy, the series also does a good job of exploring life's (and death's) bigger questions. Overall, a very worthwhile series.",1091750400,4,1490,4.9879518072289155

The show is well written, original (ok death is a common theme on a few new shows, but they don't do it like this!), and the supporting cast is fantastic!!! I keep thinking that this character or that character is a favorite, but then remember other aspects of another character I like too.  Even the smaller characters like Crystal, the happy time receptionist,  or the waitresses at Der Waffle Hous.  Kind of reminds me somewhat of the show Northern Exposure, but with a black twist.  I haven't seen the DVD, just have watched the show, but I can recomend this show to anyone, and I have!",1090972800,2,745,4.369565217391305
2001301,5,B0001GF2F6,"I first learned of This series recently when watching episodes 13 and 14 on showtime. Prior to the other day I've never heard of or have seen this program. I was completely enthralled by the beautiful characterization and the quirky black humor that filled this series. I imediately bought the DVD boxset and have spent most of today watching the series from beginning to end.

 This series offers a lot of comic relief, as well as a very large dose of cynicism. Ellen Muth is absolutely perfect in the role of George. Her narration of the series brings her thoughts closer to us, and offers a very intimate perspective of her life with her fellow reapers. Manny Patimkin is perfect in his role as the reaper foreman. I'm a little sad to see Gayheart leave after a few episodes, but am also happy they picked Laura Harris (who I first saw in her role in ""faculty"") to replace her.

 I enjoy a series that has colorful characters down to the secondary actors, such as george/milly's happy time coworkers. It's a different perspective on death, and on life. Following George's family through many of the episodes allows us a glimpse into a fully realized world that doesn't cease to enthrall us.

 I'm looking forward to season 2 starting this sunday (july 25th at 10pm, 2004). I reccomend this DVD set whole-heartedly. not only is it a great value at under $42, it's in a very attractive box with tons of artwork and extras included in every aspect of this item. I'd reccomend this just for the fact of getting close-ups of the various cast members, which fill the menues and special features sections of the DVD.",1090540800,4,1612,4.63859649122807
2001302,4,B0001GF2F6,"Originally I tuned into DLM because it was summer and there was nothing else on, and in the beginning it was just that: a pretty decent show for the summer.  However, as the season progressed I thought that the characters were fleshed out better (you learn more about the supporting cast's past) and there was even a storyline (rather than each episode being independent).
Anyways, why four stars? Because it's entertaining, full of dry humor and the characters are human and imperfect...which makes it better then 95% of the shows out there.",1089936000,2,542,4.891304347826087

I watched all 14 episodes in about 3 or 4 days. Very original ideas, a very good cast that you grow attached too, and some touching moments as well all add up to good fun.
The series is not perfect but I found myself forgiving any faults because the good far outweighs the bad. The only disappointments I had were: the special features are lacking, and one of the episodes (i think it is 12) is practically nothing but flashbacks, so if you watch this series in a matter of days like I did (and you will want to) then you will spend most of the time watching this episode either bored or fast forwarding - I don't think this was necessary at all for a show in its first season - but even allowing for these slight negatives I give Dead Like Me 5 stars!",1089676800,4,930,4.1722222222222225
2001304,5,B0001GF2F6,"I bought this set on a whim.... I don't have Showtime, but I remembered seeing a clip on the filming of the pilot on one of those entertainment TV shows. I am SO glad that I did!!!
This is a truly great show! In an age where most TV shows are ""reality"" based or just another tired, been-there-done-that premise, this one grabs hold and sucks you in. The dialogue snaps and sizzles; making me wish that I could have come up with half of those lines.  Each episode's story lines whips back and forth through both comedic and dramatic scences; never dwelling too long on the the sad aspects of death (But just enough to give the show some substance).
The charaters are exceptional. Ellen Muth plays the new reaper; most of the show is seen through her eyes as she learns the rules of her strange new existence, and trying to reconcile herself with those she left behind. Mandy Patinkin plays her boss, Rube. He is an excellent Antagonist for George (Muth). In fact, he comes off as a gruff father-figure for George. Rounding out the cast is Jasmine Guy (Remember her from ""A Different World""? You won't here), a tough talking reaper who has a day job working as a Meter-Maid; Callum Blue, a ""Trainspotting""-esque reaper; Rebecca Gayheart, the beauty queen reaper; Cynthia Stevenson, George's bitter mother and Britt McKillip, as George's weird younger sister. While there are several other recurring characters, they don't seem to be as important as the one I mentioned.
I recommend this show to any one who enjoys the quirky and unusual, as well as fans of ""Tru Calling"", ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Joan of Arcadia"", ""X-Files"" and ""Twin Peaks"".
I just wish this show was on regular TV. Now I'll have to wait for season 2 to come out on DVD. Looks like it will be a loooong wait.",1088035200,26,1778,4.608832807570978

The deleted scenes are wonderful but I wish they had not left them out of the original airing.
- We finally get to see the Post-it that brought George over to the dark side.
- Who knew that the DMV also issues Reaper licenses.
- The men at Happy Times have a very, very, VERY stange and disgusting secret.
While some of the clips are several minutes long, a few of them are only a couple of seconds which makes it hard to figure out exactly what you are watching.
I do wish they had an option that would allow you to insert the deleted clips back into the original airings so you could watch it straight through, but overall they are well worth it.
There are about 15 pictures that you can scroll through along with audio commentary and ""The Music of DLM"" Featurette.

2001307,5,B0001GF2F6,"""Dead Like Me"" proves that cynicism, humor, depth, and even compassion can not only co-exist on a single television series, they can actually flourish together. With sharp and witty writing and directing, ""Dead Like Me"" explores the bizarre world of our working-class grim reapers, the good folks charged with escorting human souls to the afterlife.  As the second-lowest level group of bureaucrats in the afterlife system (best not to ask about the lowest), grim reapers must trudge along ""popping"" the souls of the soon-to-be-departed before they meet their grisly (and, dare I say, often hilarious) ends. And they must also survive, and pay rent, in the living world.
The chief protagonist on the series is George (a.k.a. Georgia), a recently deceased, uber-cynical, 18 year old who just can't seem to resist rebelling against the whole ""death"" system. Her fellow reapers include an unapologetically opportunistic drug-smuggler, a meter-maid who does a lot more than write parking tickets, a happy-go-lucky pragmatist who has developed a truly macabre taste in photography, and an actress whose resume is surprisingly out of date. And then, of course, there is Rube.
Rube is the would-be foreman of this somewhat strange assemblage of reapers. He is also, arguably, the most sympathetic, complex, and mysterious character on the show-thanks in no small part to the superb acting of Mandy Patinkin. As with the other characters on the show, no amount of space here can really hint at the depth alloted to Rube by the writers and directors of ""Dead Like Me"" or the skill with which Patinkin explores that depth. Suffice it to say that Rube plays a lot more like a real person (or real undead person) than any mere television contrivance. Rube is more alive as a dead man than any television character from the living world.
The very essence of ""Dead Like Me"" is, in fact, its willingness to explore not only the bizarre world of the reapers, but also the lives and personalities of the reapers themselves. Undead life has had (and continues to have) some pretty strange effects on these formerly-living reapers, and watching their individual responses to the problems of their bizarre occupation provides much of the humor of the show.
And, not to leave out the living world, the creative minds behind ""Dead Like Me,"" also frequently turn their attention to living characters on the show, from the ""soon to be referred to the past tense"" reaper clients to the families they leave behind (most notably George's grieving family). Just about any character is subject to being fleshed-out on this show (even dogs and frogs). A minor character named Angus Cook makes a more memorable impression in one epsiode of ""Dead Like Me"" (appropriately titled ""A. Cook"") than most TV series regulars will make in an entire season.
Some have compared ""Dead Like Me"" with shows like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and similar, more pedestrian, fare. But about the only thing Buffy and George have in common is youth and blonde hair. And the only thing the reapers have in common with television vampires is that they've both been around a while. Of course, one of the problems with television vampires is that they never seem to *realize* they've been around a while. They are also generally kind enough to join up with either the ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" teams of the Buffyverse and its ilk, teams which don't exist in the universe of ""Dead Like Me.""
But you might want to visit the universe of ""Dead Like Me"" for yourself, and form your own impressions. Just don't stay too long. You might end up with a post-it note and a new job.",1087344000,18,3614,4.895595432300163
2001308,5,B0001GF2F6,"In the best traditions of Cult television, DLM uses a fantasy storyline to explore relationships and the way people live their lives. In the case of the reapers, the way that they live their undead lives.

George, the disaffected teenager begins to understand and appreciate things in ways that she never did in her life before becoming a reaper. Although she is the anchor-woman to the storyline, the strength of the programme is in the character development of ALL the cast. In just 14 episodes you feel an emotional attachment to the characters that you'd never get by watching a year of your favourite soap.
Buffy fans should love this series. It has darker humour than Buffy with some wonderfully adult language and one-liners but has that same mix of humour and deep intensity within the space of a couple of seconds.
Slapstick reaping scenes add to the entertainment but it's real strength is in the deeply moving interraction between the characters as they get through their lives- some living, some undead. Superbly written you are hanging on every word.
