7828886,5,6302653258,"This video is an excellent review of the Portland Trailblazers' run to the 1992 NBA Finals. The viewer is given a detailed and action-packed recap of Portland's impressive 1991-92 season. The Blazers breeze through the regular season and finish on top of the Pacific Division, followed by fantastic series' victories against L.A., Phoenix, and Utah in the playoffs. The climax occurs in the highly anticipated finals between Portland and Chicago. The entire video portrays NBA competition at its best with some of the greatest matchups in NBA history: Terry Porter vs. John Stockton, Buck Williams vs. Karl Malone, Jerome Kersey vs. Scottie Pippen, and of course...Clyde Drexler vs. Michael Jordan.",998956800,6,698,5.3545454545454545
