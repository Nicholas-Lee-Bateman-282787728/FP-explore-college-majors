762642,1,6304037279,I guess you'd also have to like Roger Moore in order to enjoy seeing him as 007 esp after Connery.,946166400,4,98,3.95
762643,5,6304037279,"One of the best of the bond films it never slowed down from start to finish the characters were all very entertaining and original from the villians Mr. Big aka Kananga,to his toadies the seven foot vodoo doctor who  for you older fans might reconize him from his commercial career,to the man  with the metal arm. Oh and how can I forget Jane Seymour in so many words  the best Bond girl to date, at least in my opinion and I don't think I'm  alone on this. It was nice to have the brains to go with looks this time.  Roger Moore was excellent in his debut role and went on to have an  impressive career as Bond.",944611200,3,612,4.1440677966101696
762644,5,6304037279,"Dear Readers,
  This is one of the most fun, exhilarating James Bond films made in the history of IAN FLEMING's movie making career.  I would highly recommend seeing it.  The Musical scores are perfect for the VOODOO  and experience that awaits you.  On the TruelyRemarkable Scale:  This movie  rates only 1 toad.  The TruelyRemarkable scale works in reverse of other  scales.  I prefer to say, the less said the better.  So, If you see one of  my reviews with 5 toads.  Please consider it to be a bomb on my scale.  Zero toads means it is one of the best movies of all times.",943574400,3,576,4.403846153846154
762645,4,6304037279,"Some people question the inclusion of this title to the James Bond Gift Set, but as the first of the Roger Moore Bonds it ushers in a new era and is important in an historical context.  One thing the commentary and  'making of"" featurette neglect to mention is that the brass at United  Artists, having felt the first non-Connery Bond a big disappointment, was  to insist that the film be so entertaining it didn't matter who played  Bond.  Having Paul McCartney doing your title song didn't hurt either.  Although I disagree with many of the things the filmmakers chose to  include, it is interesting to hear their reasonings.  For example, Bond  literally stacking the deck of tarot cards to seduce Solitaire is just  wrong, wrong, wrong.  Bond should never have to ""trick"" anyone  into bed.  Screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz must spend 20 minutes all told  saying how Moore differed from Connery.  We got it, Tom!  Filmmakers'  memories can be faulty, but someone connected to this special edition  should have told us why veteran Bond composer John Barry and actor Desmond  Llewelyn (Q) were unavailable for this outing.  Although not my favorite  Bond, there is a freshness to this film, and Moore seems more youthful  (even though he is 3 years older than Connery!) and very enthusiastic.  It  is hard to argue with success, and LIVE AND LET DIE was a big moneymaker  for the studio and the Bond team.",940723200,2,1402,4.785714285714286
762646,5,6304037279,"I just don't understand why this Bond movie gets all the bad reviews, it is one of my favorites.
It may well be that the so-called critics (who in general don't like many of the Bond classics or for that matter many of  the best movies) get to caught up trying to analysis movies.  Movies are  meant as entertainment, period.  They don't always make a social comment or  try to promote someones political ideas.
A general rule of thumb that I  have learned over the years is to go and see the movies the critics  dislike, first and foremost, as they will generally be the most  entertaining!!
This Bond is action packed and frankly, I always have  liked Moore a little more than Connery in the role...if only by a hairs  difference.
It also comes with the best Bond theme song ever with Paul  McCartney's ""Live and Let Die"" which is another of his musical  classics.
Don't let the ""experts"" scare you off of this one..it  does exactly what it is meant to do, entertain the audience....and it does  a supurb job of doing just that!",939686400,,1030,4.467741935483871
762647,3,6304037279,"Moore legt duidelijk een andere ziel in de rol van Bond, de films krijgen een komische tint vanaf dan, ook het begin van de carrire van Jane Semour, een goed film als start van Roger Moore, goed verhaal.",926553600,,203,4.368421052631579
762648,3,6304037279,"I saw this Movie after Watching first 5 Movies from Dr No to You only Live Twice and The Living Daylights and was very disappointed. Agreed... This was Moore's first Movie as Bond but he never looked as comfortable in the  Movie as Connery did in Dr No. He made the debut as Bond at the age of 46  in this Movie and looks quite old. The plot is Good... This time Bond is  dealing with Kananga , the Drug Lord. There aren't many action sequences in  this Movie but there is an overlonged Motor Boat Chase. I'd not want to  watch the Movie 3-4 times as I would if it were any of the other Bond  Movies except for The man with the Golden Gun and A view to Kill. This  Movie is certainly NOT a MUST WATCH. If you want to watch Moore really in  Action then you must see The Spy who Loved me.",922147200,,786,3.961783439490446
762649,3,6304037279,"Roger Moore's debut as 007 finds him tackling a Carribean drug kingpin. While the film is exciting at some points, and has its fair share of deathtraps and pitfalls for Bond to overcome, it lacks the bite of the  earlier films, particularly the first three in the series. Indeed, the most  noteworthy aspect of the film is the theme song performed by Paul  McCartney. Altogether, a serviceably entertaining, if not thoroughly  satisfying, entry in the Bond series.",911347200,,464,4.987012987012987

762840,3,6304037279,"Live and Let Die (1973) is the first Bond film starring Roger Moore, and it's just average. Sometimes I think this film is good, while other times I think it's below average, so I'll average it out as just okay. This film doesn't have the common 'end of the world' theme and plot, so the drug trafficking plot takes some getting used to. This film suffers a bit in that Roger Moore brings camp and not much action to a character who had been accustomed to action and intensity of character in previous films. If Moore was trying to separate himself from Connery or Lazenby, then he succeeded, but probably not in a good way. On the positive side, the other characters are respectable in their roles, and the music is good. Moore would go on to star in the just awful THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN, before significantly redeeming himself in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. This opening gig wasn't close to being his best, but it isn't exactly a clunker, either. The blu ray has nice special features, and the picture and sound are of pristine caliber.",1489104000,,1038,4.468421052631579

The action takes you from Harlem to Jamaica to New Orleans and back to Jamaica again, each time incorporating the local color and culture, and introducing characters that are both hilarious, like Sgt. Pepper the ne'er do well Louisiana Sheriff, and mesmerizing, like Baron Samedi. Featuring a stellar cast with outstanding performances by Geoffrey Holder as the Voodoo high priest, and Yaphet Kotto, who creates a James Bond villain for the ages. This was Roger Moore's first go as James Bond and he fit the role like a glove. In addition, the theme song is performed twice, once by composer Paul McCartney and Wings, and again by Brenda Arnau in a Harlem nightclub, who infused the song with a distinct jazzy feel.

But as I watch it more and more I appreciate the film and see that I underestimated the movie upon my first couple of viewings.

Live and Let Die has good music one of the best opening songs of all the James Bond movies for sure.  Jane Seymour as Solitaire was an absolute fox no doubt about that.  Yaphet Kotto played a very convincing villain as Mister Big and Dr, Kananga, the boat chase buoy scenes are pretty good and add a lot of excitement to the film.  Especially the alligator crossing scene I always think of that part first when I see this movie now.  The train villain attack scene by Tee Hee Johnson was also very well done toward the end.  he made a good sub villain like Odd Job, and Jaws etc etc.  The movie has a lot of strengths to it.

Some viewers might be a little put off by the voodoo and tarot card stuff but if you give Live and Let Die a chance you will find a lot of cool aspects to this movie.  I liked how the villains are played as smart and calculating.  The opening scene in New Orleans is pretty cool and inventive.  Though the film is not perfect it is definitely better than The Man with the Golden Gun and Moonraker for sure.  Lets face it Live and Let Die kept the series going and whether you love or hate Roger Moore as Bond he was very successful during his tenure.

Watching this in the theater I thought it amusing that an entire New York freeway could be populated with nothing but 1973 Chevy Impalas plus a single Caddy for the bad guys (this gets worse in the next film, where the now defunct American Motors Corporation was the supplier of vehicles to the production--Ramblers in Thailand!).

It also features Geoffrey Holder in a minor role (some may remember as the ""uncola guy"" from the 7-Up ads), but his considerable talent is mostly wasted here. Sadly, most of the black actors are rather embarrassing stereotypes of the pimp culture and style prevalent when this film was produced in 1972-73.

And then there's Sheriff J.W. Pepper (Clifton James). Thrown in for comic relief as a cartoon version of the worst example of a southern sheriff, he spits tobacco and acts like a buffoon. He was popular enough with audiences, though, to return in the next Bond film ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" as himself again, this time on vacation. In Thailand. Riiiiight.

763895,4,6304037279,"3.5 stars, really.

This is the first Roger Moore Bond film, and in some ways is the first reboot of the series.  It is the first Bond film since Goldfinger where the enemy is not affiliated with SPECTRE.  It is also the first Bond film to take on the drug trade.

Moore's first outing as Bond is a seriously flawed and rather haphazard affair.  If you haven't seen Roger Moore as Bond before, this film is not the best example.  It's his first in the role, and it isn't until The Spy Who Loved Me that we see him truly step comfortably into the shoes of Bond.  Most unfortunate is the fact that the filmmakers decided to err on the side of comedy rather than commentary.  Certainly, Connery's Bond had his tongue firmly planted in cheek, but his feet were also firmly grounded in reality.  Moore's Bond is so slapstick that the films, especially the early films, feel more like a Saturday morning cartoon than a serious spy flick.

That plus the racial overtones of this film make it one of the hardest of Moore's from which to glean any value.  The bad guys are all African American.  Although one of Bond's allies in the film is herself African American, she is inept and essentially a running gag for a few scenes before the film itself seems to tire of her. Sure, the enemy often gets the better of Bond - but this is true of all Bond films, and without this feature, there would be no tension

So why 3.5 stars?  In a word, stunts.  Stunts are, in the end, what drives this franchise.  And no, I am not referring to the one absolutely horrible stunt in this film (I will not spoil it here, but for the curious, google ""Live and Let Die ridiculous stunt"" and you will see what I mean).  What this movie lacks in substance, it makes up for in fun.  There is never a dull moment as Bond hunts down his quarry, and while some of the stunts and twists are by now of course dated, they haven't lost their charm with time.  The boat chase sets a precedent that would eventually be followed in hilarious fashion by The Blues Brothers.  The airplane chase might have inspired a scene in See No Evil, Hear No Evil.  And there is an interesting twist on the ""follow that car"" rubric that makes you wonder how far the rabbit hole this movie will go.  The answer: very far.  As long as you take nothing seriously, this is a wild, enjoyable ride...for the most part.",1429920000,,2358,4.345537757437071

763980,3,6304037279,"While Live And Let Die is not one of the better Bond films, it had quite a few things going for it - Jane Seymour is probably one of the most beautiful women who ever lived, and she's great as the serenely virginal/lusty Solitaire. There are also some very funky scenes in Harlem, a cool New Orleans jazz funeral, afros, crocodiles, the great Yaphet Kotto, funky voodoo ceremonies, and cool jet boat stunts. Unfortunately, the villain's ultimate plan is kind of stupid, reason for the murder of so many secret servicemen is itself cloaked in mystery, and Doctor Kananga's need to slum it is as mysterious as his addiction to tarot readings. This is Roger Moore's first Bond, but given that Moore was at that time already 46 himself - three years older than Sean Connery, actually - he was starting his run as Bond at quite an advanced age for an action star! The film also has fewer real action scenes, and some pretty limp fighting from Sir Roger himself (no train cabin battle with Red Grant, and certainly no glass-lined elevator slugfest for our man Moore). There's also a ridiculous Southern sheriff indulging himself as a hick bully so broadly it would be an embarrassment to anyone who's ever acted (I suppose the Roger Moore films indulged a bit more in comic relief material than the Bond films did - the opening scene with the espresso machine, for example, is very silly). But the scenes at the alligator farm are interesting (especially seeing how Moore does them with alligator shoes), and the ""croc walk"" scene is pretty awesome. Geoffrey Holder is also great as Baron Samedi, particularly in his final two scenes! And, of course, there's all those amazing shots of Jane Seymour, who never looks anything less than stunning!!

As with the rest of the Bond DVDs, this one comes with a plethora of bonus features; unique to this one, though, we get a full commentary by Roger Moore himself (Connery never did one for the DVDs of his films, nor did George Lazaby for On Her Majesty's Secret Service). Moore's commentary, however, is quite lifeless, and anyone who can get through the whole two hours of it is a real trooper; I did, however, manage to make it through some of it, and heard Moore talking about how it was ironic that the opening scene was of the UN buildings (where they filmed when the UN was not in session) and how years later he became a UNICEF goodwill ambassador, after being introduced to the role by Audrey Hepburn. He also gives a nice anecdote about knowing Paul McCartney as a Beatle, years before he did the theme song for Live And Let Die, and even worked with Jane Asher in The Saint. He noted the pulsar watch in the opening scene with the Italian agent in bed, and how the film crew was nearly kicked out of Harlem when their protection money ran out. The director's commentary is a highly scripted affair, with a master of ceremonies calling in Guy Hamilton, along with a whole raft of technical people and actors from the day. Not a lot of fun either.

But there's plenty of good stuff on the other bonus materials. In the Declassified MI6 Vault, we get ""Bond 1973: the Lost Documentary"" (21:40), where we learn that Roger Moore was originally asked to be Bond for Dr No in 1962 and On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969, but he wasn't available for either. Moore narrates that he got in shape for the film by doing ""half an hour in the pool, and half an hour of fairly strenuous exercise."" There's stuff about the powerboats and the hang gliders, with Guy Hamilton declaring ""Mr Big is Onassis,"" and ""perhaps no other hero has ever gone to so much trouble to get close to a girl."" Yeah, right. Moore retorts ""if Guy Hamilton thinks I'm going to do that again, he better get the other fellow back, I tell you"" in mock Scottish brogue. Hmmm... While location scouting in a helicopter, Guy Hamilton got the idea for the boat chase by seeing the bayous and waterways (although we never learn why it was a ""lost"" documentary). ""Roger Moore as James Bond circa 1964"" (7:45) shows a younger Roger Moore playing a James Bond-type spy on a variety show, hamming it up a bit for laughs. Then there's a short item on ""Live And Let Die conceptual art"" (1:40).

The Mission Dossier section contains ""Inside Live And Let Die"" (29:47), discussing how the film came together and how Burt Reynolds was considered for Bond, to the disgust of those who insisted on a British Bond. Roger Moore went to the same casino as the producers of the Bond films, so they knew him long before inviting him to play Bond. The screenwriter talked about how the film courted controversy by playing the race card, and giving Bond an African-American lover (but I don't honestly see how the film's treatment of this stuff would be so controversial, given how this was the era of blaxploitation films of black drug dealers, ghetto slang and pimpmobiles). The production designer talked about how he ""wandered around the Caribbean, found absolutely nothing of any interest."" Ross Kananga owned a crocodile farm that was used in the film and inspired the filmmakers as being larger than life, so they renamed the villain after him, Doctor Kananga (the book's key villain is called Mr Big, who appears briefly in the film; in fact, there are hardly any similarities between the book and the film, although this is never mentioned in any of the documentary materials - who cares, right?). Ross could spot the croc that ate his dad in front of his eyes on his farm. The narrator calls the jet boat on the bayou scene ""one of the most sophisticated action scenes ever produced,"" although it's hardly that; they also interviewed the lady whose lawn gets criss-crossed by jet boats. Diana Ross was originally considered for the role of Solitaire. The New Orleans portion of the film was littered with mishaps, and Roger Moore was ill with kidney stones! Perhaps there was a... voodoo curse on the film?There's a great outtake of Jane Seymour (22) strutting around in a bikini, and a clip of Roger Moore's tarot reading. ""You will have a son"", and sure enough he conceived one while on the film. Great outtakes of Ross attempting the crocodile walk stunt. There's a short ""On set with Roger Moore: the funeral parade"" (1:43) that doesn't teach us anything interesting, and ""On set with Roger Moore: hang gliding lessons"" (3:58) seems to show Moore getting ready to do his own hang gliding... not the stuntman... yeah - right!

The Ministry Of Propaganda section contains a theatrical archive of cheezy promotion reels: ""Much more...

When it comes to Bond movies you just have to take the good with the bad and I understand some might like this style of Bond and that's fine, it's just not for me. I've never cared for any of the Roger Moore movies. It's not that he's a bad Bond but to me he's easily the worst one in terms of what the movies have him say and do. Too many gadgets, too many cheeseball scenes, it's just not my style. I'm not opposed to different interpretations of the character but I've always seen Bond as a smooth and steely secret agent instead of a wise cracking joker. Right away though I hated the opening even though the Paul McCartney song was good. This one really blew me away with how racially offensive it was and just how stupid everything was. Moved too slow as well. This would rank right up there with some of the worst 007 movies I've seen.",1421452800,4,922,4.214689265536723

764518,3,6304037279,"In 1973, the James Bond film franchise was rebooted with Roger Moore's initial appearance as Agent 007 in ""Live & Let Die.""  Suffice to say: this film simply doesn't age well, as only Paul McCartney's classic title song provides a significant contribution to Bond-mania.  A weak, voodoo-flavored storyline featuring Bond and a young Jane Seymour as clairvoyant Solitaire vs. a Caribbean drug lord (well-played by Yaphet Kotto) is merely watchable.  A lengthy Louisiana bayou boat chase is the only real highlight worth fast-forwarding to.  Plagued by 1970's Hollywood stereotyping, the movie just looks and feels badly dated failing to do Moore's first Agent 007 caper much justice.

Rating: 3/5 stars.  At best, it's a guilty pleasure.",1400198400,,736,5.301724137931035
764519,1,6304037279,"We had not watched a James Bond flick in some time.  I had recalled Roger Moore as second only to Sean Connery as Bond.

764520,3,6304037279,"Roger Moore is surprisingly adept in his first run as legendary super-spy James Bond. While failed replacement George Lazenby may have better looked the part, Moore's understanding of the nuances and intangibles that define the character are dead-on. He feels cocksure, smooth and cunning, albeit not quite as deadpan as Sean Connery, and that makes him quite easy to swallow as the new leading man. Unfortunately, his first outing is not among the character's best. Overwhelmed with trendy stereotypes from the blaxploitation era, those connections seem mismatched and strained, as if the series is trying too hard to be fresh and contemporary at its own expense. Far too many outlandish characters crowd the screen, too, from the body-painted voodoo lord Baron Samedi to the gimmicky, iron-clawed henchman Tee Hee Johnson (who, naturally, giggles in every single scene). We've got a tarot card-reading virgin dubbed Solitaire, a soft-spoken behemoth named Whisper, an overzealous hayseed sheriff plucked straight from The Dukes of Hazzard and a villainous mastermind who specializes in Mission: Impossible-styled makeup effects. It's too much, a wash of color so rich that the picture turns grey. Bond's wacky gizmos are sadly downplayed (poor Q doesn't even get to show his face), while the plot seemingly exists only to transition Moore from one drawn-out chase to the next. I'm still not entirely sure where Mr. Big's endgame was meant to carry him. Even the classic McCartney theme song, which I love on its own merit, is a bad fit for the series. An effective opening statement for Roger Moore's validity in the role, it's otherwise a groan-worthy batch of bad ideas and missed connections.",1399939200,,1697,5.21978021978022

The cards determine life, love and character in the movie. My sister and I like playing tarot cards they are fun. This is Roger Moore's first outing as Bond and he did a great job. He is a more light hearted Bond than Connery and has more humor to him. It's a different type of Bond movie which makes it unique and good. I liked the fighting scenes. It had a real exciting ending. It had characters you liked. I thought Seymour was a likable character. It's important to care about the characters in the movie. It was a very fun movie. I have this one as a top three Moore Bond's.

764526,5,6304037279,"Back when this movie first came out, it was one of my favorite Bond movies, even though Roger Moore was not my favorite Bond (that goes to Sean Connery and now, more recently, to Daniel Craig).  However, in this movie, Roger Moore is portrayed far more actively than he does in later movies, where he mainly stands around looking good and bantering the bad guys to death with the occasional action scene that I don't much believe he is physicially capable of anymore.

Be that as it may, this is a great Roger Moore Bond movie.  I have watched this movie dozens of times and still love it!  It ranges from New Orleans to Harlem to a tropical island called San Monique.  It has one of the absolute BEST boat chase sequences ever done hands-down.

What connects the death of a diplomat at the UN to Mister Big and his illegal operations in Harlem to the much-feared Kananga in voodoo-controlled San Monique.  The scenes that take place in the cemetary with Baron Samedi give a haunted, supernatural tone to some of the movie...as does the vaunted psychic powers of Solitaire, Kanaga's Tarot reader/fortuneteller.  I used to shudder when I saw the scenes with the man feeding the crocodiles with his mechanical hand!  But, generally, the scene at the croc farm is one big hoot!

This Bond shows some signs of its age, but its still a goodie.  I'm ever so glad it finally came out on blu-ray, all cleaned up and sounding great!  A must for any Bond fan, even if Roger Moore is not your cup of tea.",1387324800,,1493,4.5092936802973975

The Blu ray product is the technology at its best (for all the Bonds) - clear, crisp and broadening all visuals, to say nothing of the sound etc.  It's like putting on glasses and seeing what's behind the blur.  That said I am no big fan of Roger Moore as Bond - I am a die-hard Connery enthusiast. But this was collectible for a few reasons, a first outing, & one might have the sense that it was the first new Bond since Connery (but not so), well that's how it felt in 1973 anyway. But stand alone this is a thrilling ride and hats off to the producers for sliding in Moore almost seamlessly as the new incumbent. You can enjoy this 007 outing if you drop contemporary preconceptions, which is why I give the 4 stars. Incidentally, the 007's I think worthy of switching to Blu ray for are: From Russia with Love; Goldfinger; On Her Majesty's Secret Service: Live & Let Die; The Spy who Loved Me; The Living Daylights; Goldeneye; Casino Royale.  Incidentally, I don't include Daniel Craig's latest because if you removed the nods-to and re-evolving into formulaic Bond, Skyfall is a preposterous outing and Craig cannot metamorphisize back into classic Bond - he isn't the right fit.  Leave him as a gritty Bourne and he'll be right. He lacks the wit, elegance & sophistication to return to the original Bond formula.",1376956800,,1363,4.502024291497976

764657,4,6304037279,"Roger Moore comfortably stepped into the role of james Bond in the eighth Bond film, Live And Let Die.  It is true that there was a passing thought to offer the role to Burt Reynolds but the producers said it had to be a British actor for Bond was British.  The producers turned to Roger Moore, an actor they had considered back in 1962.

Roger Moore takes over as Bond who is hot on the trail of whoever has killed three MI-6 agents (in San Monique, New Orleans and the UN in New York City) killed in the pre-film sequence.  The trail leads him to Harlem and Mr. Big, a known heroin kingpin and the owner of dozens of Fillet of Soul restaurants.  From there he discovers that Dr. Kananga (named after the real-life owner of the crocodile farm featured in the movie) has a stranglehold on his little island country of San Monique in the Caribbean.  Dr. Kananga is guarded by mechanical armed-Tee Hee (Julius W. Harris), the voodoo priest, Baron Samendi (Geoffrey Holder), a slew of hoods  and guided by Solitaire (Jane Seymour).  Bond seduces Solitaire and gains entry into Kananga's world.  In time, Bond finds out that Kananga and Mr. Big (Yaphet Kotto) are the same man. Bond uncovers the villains plan to distribute 2 tons of free heroin in order to destroy and re-claim the heroin market.  Bond must tangle with a number of attempts on his life: in Harlem; at Mr. Big's hideout, at an airport, at a crocodile farm, in the bayou, and finally on the island of San Monique.  In the end, he dispatches Kananga by way of a gas-propelled shark bullet and sharks.  Of course, there is the henchman final attempt on Bond's life by Tee Hee in a train cabin.  This is the second such fight (the first was with Red Grant in From Russia With Love) in the Bind series,

The film looks and feels like a hip 1970s action/black action film with a spice of enough Bond.  There is a great Louisiana Bayou speedboat chase, a wild double-decker and police car chase, a wild land-bound plane chase and neat escape from a crocodile farm.  The Black Stunt Man Association and many African American actors had lead roles in this ground-breaking Bond film.  The emphasis is on action here with only a few major sets used.

The cast includes the regular ones: Bernard lee as M and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny.  Felix leiter is back nut this time he is played by David Hedison, the fifth actor to do so.  Making his debut as a Bond character is Clifton James as Sheriff Pepper, the frustrated local New Orleans police officer.  This film launched the hip Bond years (1970s -1980s).  Watch it and enjoy a hipper, smiling and smooth Bond.

Side note: The producers fascination with man-eating fish (sharks) continues with this film.  Thunderball had killer sharks and You Only Live Twice had piranhas.",1376179200,,2781,4.582995951417004

764797,5,6304037279,"""Live and Let Die"" is another highly adventuresome spy film in the James Bond series with Roger Moore as the new James Bond, adding his own trademark to the Bond series with his very own flashes of style. Roger Moore caters to his own strengths, thereby creating a role that is tailored to his acting style - that of a more relaxed, charming and humorous character. The movie also introduces the very appealing Jane Seymour in her first ever 007 role as ""Solitaire"", who possesses the supernatural gift of reading Tarot cards. In the end, her powers disappear after she sleeps with James Bond, who else... This movie ranks as one of my personal favorites. I feel that Roger Moore makes a perfectly likable 007.

Despite its supernatural elements, ""Live and Let Die"" contains some of the more realistic and engaging plots, among which are: (a) the most notable and spectacular boat chase around the Louisiana bayous with Bond being chased in a motorboat by the villain's henchmen, skillfully cruising his way through the marshlands and smashing up a wedding party in the process; (b) Bond desperately trying to evade a bunch of hungry crocodiles; and (c) another notable sequence with Bond skillfully evading the island police aboard a slow and lumbering double-decker bus with the poor Solitaire sitting at the back of the bus and presumably nerve-wracked.

The title song, written by Paul and Linda McCartney and sung by Paul McCartney and Wings, for me is one of the best of the James Bond movie theme songs ever. It is a perky, lively, and powerful song which provides the frosting on this ""James Bond cake"", so to speak. I feel that ""Live and Let Die"" has been well photographed and edited, making clever and extensive use of the wonderful title song by Paul and Linda McCartney. Despite the movie being two hours long, anti-climactic, and at times ludicrous, James Bond movie fans ""are really in for a treat"". Overall, this movie is fun and entertaining and Roger Moore handled his James Bond character very well. Despite its flaws, this is a truly good movie, and a great way to start off the Roger Moore/James Bond era.

764906,3,6304037279,"Roger Moore makes his first appearance as Bond after Sean Connery's departure and George Lazenby's box office disappointment a few years earlier.  Although Moore is 3 years older than Connery, he looks younger and brings a new sophistication to the role both in dress and deportment.  Moore's Bond film also heightens the humor quotient, although often to a fault.

Nothing wrong with the occasional Bond's quips.  After all, that is part of his character.  But the middle section of the film contains a fully charged and memorable boat chase through various inland waterways of southern Louisiana only to be lengthened and interrupted by the first appearance of Sheriff Pepper (Clifton James) who will show up in several future Bond films.  Pepper is a complete nincompoop and seems more suited to the Burt Reynolds/Clint Eastwood cornpone films of the era.

Bond is sent to New York, Bayou country and a fictitious Caribbean nation to find out why some of his fellow agents are disappearing.  Mr. Big (Yaphet Kotto) is a gangster and also Kananga, the island's leader.  He's growing poppies all over the island with plans to send tons of cocaine and heroin to the U. S. and give it away.  You know, hook everyone then charge the hell out of it.

Geoffrey Holder still makes a living in commercials replaying his role as the laughing Baron Samedi, a secondary villian.  And lovely Jane Seymour makes her first big screen appearance as Solitaire, a fortune teller working for the bad guys and subject to Bond's affection.  Bond also makes whoopee with bad girl Rosie (Gloria Hendry) in what was still illegal in many southern states.  This is far from the best Bond film or even the best Moore as Bond film, but it isn't bad either.  The fresh faced new Bond works here.

The upgrade to Blu ray is certainly worth the extra expense as the transfer is excellent.  With a video resolution of 1080p and an aspect ratio (1.85:1) consistent with the original film, the film looks as good as it can be.  Colors are well displayed and there are plenty of colors used in this Caribbean/New Orleans centered film.  I saw no artifacts or video noise.  The audio track contains a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option and certainly is the way to go.  At the same time it isn't all that great.  I had to strain a few times to understand some of the dialog.  There was also some unusual sound effects that just magically appeared in the left front speaker for some reason.  I suspect not much was done to enhance what was probably a suspect original audio mix.  The music seems to be the exception.  The film features one of the best theme songs of the Bond films performed by Paul McCartney and Wings along with George Martin's score.",1364774400,,2715,4.6991525423728815

Bond has to investigate the head of small (fictional) Caribbean nation. Along the way it connects to the disappearance of one of their agents, heroin selling in Harlem, and a Voodoo cult. The sheer strangeness of the movie really gives it a unique feel. The locations are interesting although seeing Bond in Harlem getting called a ""haunky"" seems more appropriate to Shaft or Superfly. It is interesting to see how different NYC looks now compared to 1973. The scene with the gators is awesome in Louisiana as is all of the action. This movie actually has 3 pretty good henchmen which might be unmatched in a Bond film; usually these movies are lucky to have 1 good henchman per movie. The only big black eye I'd give this one is GW Pepper- the hillbilly stereotype in Louisiana. He might be the worst character in a Bond film ever. Think Boss Hog meets Yosemite Sam. It's not only an unfunny stereotype- it's downright offensive and embarrassingly outdated. The fact that he reappears in ""Man with the Golden Gun"" is inexplicable. I personally hate the stadium rock theme by McCartney, but it ranks as many people's all time favorite Bond theme.

765030,3,6304037279,"Live and Let Die(1973) is a fun James Bond movie based on a controversial Ian Fleming novel. This is the first 007 film with Roger Moore as James Bond.  This film took some criticism for its stereotypical black bad guys, far fetched plot and an annoying, racist highway patrol officer played by Clifton James. This is the first 007 film to use a supernatural tone. Also, it emulated 1970's blaxploitation films. Live and Let Die is still a good movie. It has colorful action scenes. George Martin composed the music score for the film and Paul McCartney and the Wings perform the theme song Live and Let Die. Some ideas from the novel Live and Let Die ended up in the 007 movies For Your Eyes Only(1981) and Licence to Kill(1989) such Bond being dragged from a boat and Felix Leiter losing a leg to a shark. Jane Seymour and Madeline Smith do count as lovely Bond girls.
David Hedison is quite as Felix Leiter. The scene where Bond runs over the backs of alligators was awesome! It was spoofed in Austin Powers in Goldmember(2002).

Watched it recently and w/ a grain of salt it holds up well. Yes, the 1970's styles is dated and the fight scenes are foolish; reminiscent of the old Bob Hope karate chops on the neck. Maybe we can call it under stated? There is romance, surprisingly a bi-racial involvement that is never seen today.
The inner city Black crime boss world is presented as credible, alien and frightening. This movie holds up to modern day scrutiny and if you squint your eyes you could imagine that was Jason Statham not Roger Moore. The switches between New York and Haiti work well w/ Voodoo magic as a great addition. Toss in New Orleans and a great boat chase and what more do we need? Whoever is making all those Jason Statham action films has no doubt watched this movie.
In today's politically correct movie this film could not be made, however the story holds true. There are Black criminals in American big cities and there are corrupt third world dictators (is that a redundancy?)

765135,1,6304037279,"YES! It's the first James Bond movie not to feature gadget master Q! Well that's not accurate, he's not featured in Dr No either, at least not portrayed by Desmond Llewellan.

Many elements from previous entry Diamonds Are Forever are here - back to that stumbling block later - except one key element - Sean Connery. He had got the Bond Franchise back on the wheels of bank-a-bility and took off with credibility mostly intact and left James Bond in the hands of...well, not a younger man but a contemporary. The man both Bond Creator, Ian Fleming, and the producers originally wanted but was contracted to play Brit TV's ""The Saint"" throughout the 60's yes, pray enter - Roger Moore!!

...and have a cigar. Moore does a few times during Live and Let Die to show the new Bond isn't a cigarette smoker and to emphasise he's totally different to Connery (he even favours straight bourbon, no martini's evident in this entry) This sleeker, lighter played, more formal and gentlemanly Bond is also a perfect fit for the new direction of the Bond series for the 70's...hell bent on loud action set pieces, little story line or character and plenty of escape, capture and chase scenes. Least that's what happens in Live and Let Die, and it delivers in...well can't say that.

Live and Let Die keeps the cash train a-rollin' for the Bond movies and gives Roger Moore a dazzling action packed debut where he stands out as the least wooden thing in the whole movie. No safari suits are evident and maybe that's why Roger doesn't seem totally into the part yet.

Back to the stumbling block - all the worst elements of Diamonds Are Forever are brought back and emphasised in Live and Let Die. By the same director, Guy Hamilton, who doesn't create any atmosphere for this film. Maybe he was trying too hard to make a James Bond homage to the great blax-ploitation pictures of the early 70's that it ends up feeling like a B-grade picture. Now seeming seriously dated with one dimensional characters all round through to the red neck deep south Sheriff used for 'comedy' relief.

There are things to love about the movie...the voo-doo angle is awesome, the fact the story is about drug smuggling rings not world domination for a change and has a cool villain that has two faces. One a respectable, smooth diplomat and the other, a rubber faceded crude Harlem thug called Mr Big. Mesmerising actor Yaphet Kotto's the bad guy and he rings every drop out of the near dry tea bag that is his character and nearly makes him a great villain!

There's his visually great henchmen, the too tall Baron Samdee, the metal armed Tee-Hee and the bloated Whisper. All who chase Bond in cars, trains, boats and planes. There's the chase in a double decker bus...Bond caught on an island of crocodiles armed with wits only and of course...the shining beauty of Jane Seymour,as a bedazzling dressed psychic, unfortunately light on character...oh and the fight on the train which rips off the superior one in From Russia With Love.

The disc reproduction though is staggering, a picture so clear you want to dive in and it's not even blu-ray and only marred by the actual film content. The extras are great as usual but like the movie light on compared to other entries but have to wince every time on the ""making of"" doco showing what nearly happened to the stunt man who actually ran across the backs of those crocodiles for several takes.

Welcome now James Bond in live action comic book form. Turn your brain off for mindless fun but enjoy Paul McCartney's fantastic theme song...about the only part of the film that hasn't dated. Came out in 1973, as identified by the waa-waa pedal. Watch it only when badly hung over........

765204,5,6304037279,"Yesterday (10-5-12) was the 50th anniversary of both the arrival of Bond in the movies and The Beatles' release of ""Love Me Do"" , so I popped in my recently purchased (from Amazon) Bluray of ""Live And Let Die"" which appropriately, of course,  features Paul and Linda McCartney/Wings' title song and George Martin's soundtrack work. So, now, early on 10-6-12, my brief review. Bond fans MUST have this Bluray! The sound is superb, and the picture is top-notch...rich detail, and monumentally better than I recall from network TV viewings  years ago. That is, Bluray delivers here! Really cool, amazingly crisp! Some scenes look almost 3-D! The extras make this Bluray a collector's dream. The commentaries are thoughtful and informative....You'll thrill to the crown jewel of the bonus features: ""Inside Live and Let Die""...splendid! There's a circa 1964 British TV spoof with Sir Roger Moore playing James Bond...a bit corny, very slapstick, but a special and rare collectible! This and some other footage are in B/W and some of the extras footage is of modest quality print-wise, but I am so glad they included such rarities for their historical significance. Love it! Virtually every cast member including Hedison, Kotto, Seymour, and Moore have high quality screen and audio time on the bonus features. The film alone (in its Bluray brilliance) or the extras alone, in their thoughtful and thorough bounty, make this an absolute ""must have"". Put all of these together...and it's pure dynamite! Enjoy! Happy 50th, 007! You,too, Paul and Beatles! (One nitpik...unless I just could not locate it, no theatrical trailer. I realize that many folks don't prize trailers....but I like having them. I consider trailers important historically and fun, and scene selection (included here) nearly essential).",1349481600,,1800,5.246527777777778
765205,5,6304037279,"This the the 007th James Bond movie and the first for Roger Moore as Secret Agent 007, ""James Bond"" who continues the role from Sean Connery.
  A British agent, Hamilton (Robert Dix), is killed in New Orleans by Kananga's henchman (Alvin Acorn). A funeral parade of black people are walking down the French Market area with a coffin in front of them. They put down the coffin over Hamilton and when lifted back up, the body has disappeared. Suddenly, the black people change their solemn mood and begin to celebrate with the music of jazz.
  A tribal dance of voodoo is taking place at night on Kananga's island of San Monique. Another agent, Baines (Dennis Edwards), is being threatened by Dambala (Michael Ebbin), a tribal dancer, who is holding a snake at Baines face. The snake bites the agent and kills him.
  James Bond is called in to fly to New Orleans to investigate and find the villain, Kananga (Yaphet Kotto) who also disguises himself as ""Mr. Big"".
  Bond discovers Kananga has a beautiful woman, a tarot card reader, Solitare (Jane Seymour) at his residence. Kananga is always asking her questions about what the cards say for him. Is it death?
  After Bond meets the vulnerable Solitare, he charms her into going to bed with him.
 Afterwards, she reveals to Bond that she was a virgin and now feels that she no longer has her powers.  Her virtue has been taken from her.
  Bond feels she is being kept captive by Kananga and tries to help her escape Kananga's wrath. But Kananga has dastardly plans for Mr. Bond and wants to conquer the world.

 Not one of my favorite James Bond movies, but the film does contain many humorous scenes.
 Gloria Hendry (as ""Rosie Carver""), Arnold Williams (as the cab driver) and Geoffrey Holder (as ""Baron Samedi"") are scene stealers.
  You might remember Geoffrey Holder from his classic 7-UP commercials.

 Another scene stealer is Clifton James as ""Sheriff J.W. Pepper"". He also returns in The Man With the Golden Gun (1974) and Superman II (1980).

 Roy Hollis also returns from Diamonds Are Forever (1971), first scene as the Las Vegas Sheriff in the prior movie, is now a Louisiana State Trooper.

The speed boat jump made it into the Guinness Book of World Records.

TRULY, this film will make you crack up as some key scenes are acted out with such passion -- you will crack up and laugh a whole lot!  The Chase in the hi-powered speed boat is a real Hoot 4sure!  No, please understand-I would NOT recommend this film for age 12 or under as it does deal with extreme real looking - truly fearful looking demon and witch-doctor related scans.  I think this film would be an excellent tool for a christian family to enjoy & then use as a backdrop to talk about your own family values along with bible scripture discussion.  Kids need to understand that in some parts of the world (several overseas country's) satan is worshiped in a very serious way and parents could teach family there is a real dark movement and power & results connected to devil worship.

765207,3,6304037279,"For some 007 fans, the early Roger Moore years are the most difficult Bond era to come to terms with. We can all remember the over-the-top stunts, overly-long chase scenes with cheesy henchmen and the sometimes just plain silly arch-bad guys? And, while Moonraker stands as the epitome of all that was wrong with these films, the poorly developed Live & Let Die certainly lacks most of the elements that made the Connery films stand out.

  First of all, without giving away too many plot specifics, it is obvious that the creative team wanted to not only leave no doubt the Sean Connery years as Bond were over but they also seem to have been bent on making a statement about race relations in the 1970s. The intentions were noble but the product comes off as obvious, laughable and one could even argue counterproductive.

  Bond stands out like a sore thumb as he spends entirely too much time trying to sneak around all-black neighborhoods, trying to bribe suspicious-looking black employees in seedy-looking shops who obviously wish him ill. Worst of all, the way almost every black character in the movie seems to work for the main villain, Kananga, it almost seems to suggest that all black people are in a criminal cabal. Again, silly but also counterproductive to any positive message the movie may have intended to present.

  Second of all, the cynical and jester-like Bond of Roger Moore seems a too-radical departure from Connery's serious and capable MI6 operative. Whereas Connery's 007 always seemed to be plotting and planning no matter what happened, even arguing with his captors to try and cause them to mess up and give him an advantage, Moore's version seems content to crack jokes and poke fun at the idiosyncrasies of his enemies. Additionally, the fighting scenes which in the Connery years were generally believable evolve into a tendency to be silly and often slapstick in appearance in this film. The way Kananga dies at the end, for instance, is absolutely unbelievable and abrupt.

  One huge positive to this movie is, as with the other Bond HD releases, the superb quality of the audio and video. The extras are pretty decent overall but the real star is the transfer. Well done in this department I must say.

  Overall, I give this film three stars. It is fun to watch especially if escapism is more important than any figment of believability. It is a very entertaining movie and at the going price at Amazon which usually seems to be about $10 give or take, it is a good purchase if you are either bored or a fanatic Bond fan. However, if believability is a must for you in a spy thriller, try a different 007 mission.",1342310400,2,2654,4.739130434782608

765209,4,6304037279,"This is eight in the James Bond series and the first 007 adventure starring Roger Moore.

The story starts in New York City, moves to a Caribbean Island and 2,000 crocodiles, and returns to New Orleans for a spectacular boat chase. The enemy is ""black magic"", secretly vested in future-telling ""Solitaire"" (played by Jane Seymour) that attempts to cover up the massive heroine-growing operation of a powerful drug lord (Yaphet Kotto) and a scheme to conquer the world.

However, Roger Moore takes it all in stride as James Bond would; with charm, wit, and deadly assurance.

Disc two includes the usual features; how the movie was made, the crocodiles and how the players were chosen. Also included is an interesting TV skit with Roger Moore playing James Bond from earlier years.",1341792000,3,780,4.938931297709924
765210,2,6304037279,"I only give it two stars because while it's certainly bad, it's not worse than moonraker. Or Man With The Golden Gun, but close. Having recently gone back and watched the series again, I can say that when I watched this movie again. I was reminded how painful it can be, Now Roger Moore was replacing Sean Connery. No small task, but right away. Roger's bond is more, jokey. Jump in bed with any available woman at the time, a cartoonish bond. And it didn't help that Live And Let Die, puts Bond in Harlem. And in louisiana, and finally Jamaica. Jane Seymore does her best as Solitare, and to be quite honest. Yaphet kotto steals the movie as Kanaga, other than Julius Harris who plays Teehee. I do agree with some of the other reviewers, this was the start of the decline of the franchise. You know it's a really bad movie, when you only want to watch it with the commentary on. And even that is laughable, because they try to explain why they wrote it this way. There's no excuse for Bond becoming a shell of himself, when Roger Moore took. Thank God Timothy Dalton saved it, And Pierce Brosnan kept it alive. Again, it's pretty bad when the only good part of the movie, is a bit player. Sheriff Pepper, and we have a whole scene of bond trying to escape from the bad guys, by stealing a plane, trashing it. Then jumping in a motor boat, Now the chase was cool, but pointless. I do agree, this movie started the fall.",1341273600,,1419,4.338345864661654

09.  Having been a diehard fan of this film from it's release in my childhood, and I just learned one of the most famous 'escapes' wasn't faked.  Umm... The alligator/island bit was done by a stuntman.  (Search YouTube if you don't believe me.)

08.  Paul McCartney and George Martin's theme song is still being performed today.  (See Celine Dion in Vegas if you don't believe me.)  The song has been covered only how many times?

07.  MIDNIGHT RUN fans will be delighted to see Yaphet Kotto as more than one villain.  Sure, he makes a weird move at the beginning of a knife fight, but that's only sauce for the goose.  Back in the day of this release, when black actors were few and far between, Yaphet was one scary @$$ villain to us pasty white types.  And nobody but nobody slaps --

06.  --- beautiful Jane Seymour, introduced here as Solitaire and one of the most lovely/classy Bond girls ever.  Speaking of lovely/classy, there's --

05.  -- Roger Moore himself, who over the years has had to take a lot of guff for not being brawny hairy Sean Connery.  I appreciate the Sean years but a change was really needed.  There's a moment in LIVE AND LET DIE where Bond is wearing Solitaire's over the top card read get-up and holding her cards.  The look on his face upon being discovered ONLY Moore could have pulled off.  His playful thing is GOLD in this movie and the next few that followed.  Did Roger Moore linger too long after Spy Who Love Me?  Absolutely.  Does Moore nail his first Bond film?  WITHOUT A DOUBT.

04.  The racist sheriff is worth the $10 of this Blu-Ray alone.

03.  The boat chase scene is so unbelievably BRILLIANT you can take all your Star Wars and Harry Potter movies and BURN THEM.  Honestly.  If I had to have all those wretched movies removed from the Earth to save this one chase scene, I'd light the match.  Zero hesitation.

02.  This film unfortunately documents an era of racism and male chauvinism... which is another way of saying it's perfectly relevant to our present.  (Read:  Tea Party and Kardashians.)

01.  One of Moore's best Bonds.  One of Bond's most beautiful girls.  One of the best songs.  One of the best chase scenes ever.  One of the most unique stunts (alligators).  This movie introduced the first digital device.  The most hilarious comic relief.  The downright creepy but charming Kula Nut guy.  Oh -- and I've compared the DVD picture to the BLU-RAY.

765393,4,6304037279,"Roger Moore's first appearance as James Bond lacks the iconic imagery of Sean Connery in ""Dr. No"" and the cool of George Lazenby in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" but his introductory movie is a pretty good entry to the franchise that casually ushers in a new era of Bond.

In ""Live and Let Die"", Bond is assigned to investigate a string of murders linked to the fictional Caribbean island San Monique. The pre-title sequences, which depict these events, are among some of the best in the movie; an elaborate ""faux"" funeral procession in New Orleans' famed French Quarter that bursts with culture, and is as clever as it is disturbing, is my favorite of the three.

The main plot of the movie involves heroin kingpin Mr. Big and San Monique's leader Kananga, who is being closely monitored by the CIA following the murders. Kananga is a decent villain, serviceable enough for a movie like this, but he is pretty forgettable relative to most of the other villains in the series. Tee Hee, Kananga's large, metal-armed henchman who never fails to find humor in any situation, as well as the mysterious Baron Samedi, make much better villains.

Locations are a highlight of the movie. Early scenes depict Bond's first trip to New York City and feature some fantastic on-site footage, a loaded ""Pimp Mobile"" (comparable to his DB5, even), and a great chase scene involving a very friendly cabbie. Later, Bond follows Kananga to San Monique where the Voodoo theme that in many ways defines the movie permeates throughout. Tarot cards, creepy voodoo ""scarecrows,"" and haunting rituals all give ""Live and Let Die"" a unique flair that greatly contrasts it with all the other Bond movies.

Action scenes are plentiful throughout the movie, including a close encounter on a crocodile farm (where trespassers are warned they ""will be eaten"") that is followed soon after by an extended speedboat chase in the Louisiana bayou. In these scenes, Moore proves he is every bit Bond as he expertly outmaneuvers an onslaught of enemies in a speedboat.

Overall, ""Live and Let Die"" is a solid action movie, but as a Bond movie for me it ranks near the bottom of the list. The overall plot of heroin smuggling is much less exciting, and in many ways much less worthy of Bond's attention, than the plots of any other Bond movie. Fans of 007 will almost certainly want to watch this movie, but for any casual action movie fan, there are many better Bond movies to see.",1297296000,,2448,4.777777777777778
765394,2,6304037279,"I think this is probably the strangest of the James Bond films. Its even stranger in its own way than the 1960s version of Casino Royale which was trying to be strange. Its interesting in a ""what were they thinking"" or a ""train wreck"" kind of way. But a good bond film it is not.

Roger Moore steps into the role of James Bond. And the first thing decided apparently was that Bond had been too serious in the 1960s. It needed more laughs and lite comedy. Or else everyone was out of their mind on drugs. Any way I look at it, its not really James Bond in the traditional sense. Its almost at the level of self-satire. I suspect part of the reason for it was the politics of the era. The Cold War, Spies and the like were definiately not acceptable. So maybe the film is less a bad film than a film that reflects the politics and values of its era.

And speaking of its era, this is also a blaxploitation film. Its the usual mix of drug dealers and the good man trying to save the poor from heroin. The formula followed is entirely predictable. Some of its very laughable such as James Bond's undercover investigations of the world of voodoo. To say the least, he doesn't quite fit in.

Yaphet Kotto does a good job in playing a cartoonish villian. But its so cartoonish that its difficult to take seriously in the context of the movie. He and his henchment would have been great for Austin Powers movie. But for me, James Bond has to be more serious to work at all as a character/story. They throw in Gloria Hendry as the inevitable CIA agent just to make absolutely sure we know its a blaxploitation film.

Then there is Clifton James. For some reason they decided to put a stereotypical southern sheriff into this thing. It makesa as much sense as anything else. James hams it up and plays it ""Dukes of Hazzard"" broad.

The title song is by Paul & Linda McCartney and Wings. It was nominated for an academy award. Like many things that seemed a good idea at that time, the song is horrible.

As weird as the film is, it could have been even weirder. The story is that the Producers really wanted Clint Eastwood as Bond for this film rather than Roger Moore. Eastwood wisely (and quickly) declined. And maybe thats why the film is so strange. Nobody involved really wanted to do James Bond but they wanted the money that would come from doing a James Bond film. But they tried with everything they had to wipe out everything associated with the James Bond character from the film and make a more conventional American action film.

Its a bad flim. But it can be an entertaining film because of how absolutely strange most of it seems today.",1296345600,,2641,4.3885480572597135
765395,4,6304037279,"""Live and Let Die"" was the second Bond film I saw in theaters so I'm partial to it and willing to over look some of the flaws of the film. It's not Roger Moore's best outing but it's entertaining, has a terrific bad guy played by Yaphett Koto and it's the first and only Bond film that incorporates elements of the then popular blaxploitation films satirizing that genre. If you add in the Paul McCartney & Wings theme song you've got a winner for a lot of folks. The shift to humor began before ""Live and Let Die"" and the closest in tone to this film at the time that balanced humor/intrigue and stunts was the last Sean Connery Bond film ""Diamonds Are Forever"". The element of satire is stronger in ""Live and Let Die"" compared to previous Bond flicks but it works quite well.

The Blu-ray for ""Live and Let Die"" has been lovingly restored by Lowry. The film has not looked this good ever--even when it was first released. The original interpositive has been cleaned up and scanned in at 4K (high resolution digital)allowing for a sharp, colorful transfer. Detail considering when it was made is amazingly sharp over all.

Bond (Moore)travels to Harlem and the Caribbean trying to find the connection between Kananga and ""Mr. Big"" (Kotto)a drug lord based on the Caribbean. Turns out that ""Mr. Big"" is using Solitare (Jean Seymour in her big screen debut)a fortune teller who helps ""Mr. Big"" plan his every move. In the process Bond is menanced by ""Mr. Big's"" henchmen Tee Hee (Julius Harris) a man with a mechanical arm who leaves Bond stranded among a group of VERY hungry crocodiles and Whisper (Earl Jolly Brown)a big man with a very little voice. Bond must rely on intel from Felix Lightner (David Hedison--the only actor to play Lightner in two Bond films) his CIA counterpart and turning Solitare to his side.

Moore takes his first turn in the role as Bond a lot more seriously than some of his later films (where he seemed to be aping his performance in his popular 60's TV series ""The Saint""). Koto delivers a delicious performance in the film as the villain and is one of the more memorable villains from the 70's Bond films.

We get some terrific extras here--a combined commentary track featuring screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz, director Guy Hamilton, Roger Moore. The documentary included is a re-edited version of the one that appeared on British TVon the standard DVD upgraded to HD; it includes footage of Moore playing Bond in a 1964 skit which is a chuckle if only for the fact that he 1) is over-the-top and 2)ended up playing Bond eventually and some outtakes from the sequence where Bond runs on the heads of the crocodiles. Patrick MacNee (who played the role of Steed in the 60's TV series ""The Avengers"" and eventually appeared in ""A View To A Kill"")provides narration.

The Bond films would drift into more humor (for good and bad--with ""Moonraker"" representing one of the worst Bond films ever) with further installations featuring Moore before the more serious Timothy Dalton Bond films brought the series almost full circle back to ""Dr. No"" (although on a much smaller budget).

765501,4,6304037279,"I've been a Roger Moore fan since he replaced James Garner on ""Maverick.""  ""The Saint"" is one of my 10 favorite tv shows.  I've been a Bond fan since seeing Sean Connery in ""Dr. No,"" at age 13, in my local theater.  When Connery stepped down as Bond, as far as I was concerned, no one but Roger Moore could replace him.  I was on vacation in Europe, after graduating college, when ""Live and Let Die"" premiered in the U.S.  The day after I returned home I rushed to closest movie theater it was playing in to see it.  Actually, it was kind of a disappointment.
The Bond films had grown in size and scope since the first film, ""Dr. No.""  I was used to and enjoyed the epic nature of each Bond film.  (I even thought the previous Bond, ""Diamonds are Forever"" to be a letdown compared to the previous great Bond film ""On Her Majestys Secret Service.""  I found ""Live and Let Die"" even more of a letdown.
Lets look at the positives and the negatives.  ""Live and Let Die"" is basically a bunch of chases and escapes: Bond gets captured, he escapes, he gets captured again, he escapes again, etc.  Some of the escapes are quite good.  There is a wonderful long motorboat chase sequence in the bayou where Bond is pursued by three or four motorboats of villains.  This scene is beautifully photographed from above and accompanied by some very nice music by George Martin (his only Bond score.)  Compare this excellent chase sequence to the recent confusing mediocre boat sequence in ""Quantum of Solace"" and you will see how good it really is.  There is also probably the scariest escape in the series wherein Bond, trapped upon a small platform in the middle of a lake, must escape by running across the backs of several live crocodiles.  This scene was actually filmed at an crocodile farm owned and run by one Ross Kananga, who performed this hairraising stunt himself.  The blu-ray shows this scene actually being filmed, (it was repeated several times,) and the crocs almost sunk their teeth into Mr Kananga on several occassions.  You couldn't get me to try this stunt for 10 million dollars.
The leading lady, Solitaire, a young virgin (until deflowered by Bond,) is played by the very young Jane Seymour, who I believe to be one of the prettiest leading ladies of the series.  Those of you who just know her from ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" should see how young, beautiful and sexy she was in this film.  (She still is quite a good looking woman based on those commercials she has been appearing in that I have been seeing.)  The villain played by Yaphet Kotto is okay, his death scene is one of the sillier I've seen in the Bond films.  Roger's old friend David Hedison (since he guest starred on an episode of ""The Saint,) plays Felix Leiter.  He really isn't given much to do.  (He was given more to do when he played Felix again in the Timothy Dalton Bond ""License to Kill.""  There is fed to the sharks by the villain and loses his leg.)  Clifton James plays redneck Sheriff J.W. Pepper and he is hilarious during the boat chase sequence.  (He would not be so hilarious when stupidly reused in the next Bond ""The Man with the Golden Gun."")  The secondary leading lady played by Gloria Hendry is such an annoying moron that one breathes a sigh of relief when she is quickly knocked off.
I was not a fan of the Paul McCartney and Wings theme song at the time, it has grown on me however over the years.  The film has grown on me as well.  It is not great, but fairly entertaining.  It is certainly way better than the next Bond film, ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" which I consider to be one of the 2 or 3 worst films in the series.  Moore really doesn't seem totally comfortable playing Bond in this film or the next one.  He would make the role his own however in his third Bond, the terrific ""The Spy Who Loved Me.""
Roger does an audio commentary on this Bond film (and his others on blu-ray and dvd.)  It is enjoyable to listen to.  He does state that, next to ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" ""Live and Let Die"" is his personal favorite Bond.  It is not mine although, as I have stated, it has improved with time.
The picture and sound quality on this blu-ray are excellent.  The other special features are basically the same found on the deluxe DVD.",1266105600,3,4245,4.423969072164948

765503,2,6304037279,"While the decline of James Bond movies may have begun with Diamonds Are Forever, the first of the Roger Moore era, 1973's Live and Let Die was a blast of nitrous oxide in the wrong direction.
Where to start? Solitaire's pre-Queen Amidala costumes? Roger Moore's pseudo-suave act; smoking a cigar while parasailing? Come on...at least Mike Myers was doing it purely for fun, the ridiculous CIA agent Rosie (that would be Comically Ineffective Actress)? The unflattering homage to blacksploitation movies? The not one, but TWO death attempts (shark and alligator) that would make Scott Evil and the good folks at Looney Tunes wretch - stepping over the backs of crocodiles? Are you kidding me? Or how about the decidedly un-exotic locales of Harlem, rural Louisiana, and the dirty slums of the Caribbean? Any of those is bad, but combined into one movie it is truly painful to watch at times.
Jayne Seymour does her best and is a classic example of the beautiful but problematic Bond woman, but Yaphet Koto is clearly one of the most wooden villains in Bond history and Moore fails on all levels as an effective Bond. It makes one appreciate the job Daniel Craig has done all the more.
Live and Let Die is an embarrassment to the Bond franchise and the first in a dreadful series of missteps regarding the Bond entity. It is played for cheesy thrills, campy laughs, and the emasculation of a great cinematic and literary guy, and that's just not cricket, baby.",1256688000,5,1458,4.7896825396825395
765504,4,6304037279,"When I asked my readers (and my friends and co-workers) which of the Bond Blu-Ray releases I should watch first, they unanimously picked Live and Let Die. Obviously if you've been reading my reviews you know that I ignored them, purely because I didn't want to start off with Roger Moore's first outing as Bond, which is an...odd film, to say the least.

With Connery (and Lazenby) gone from the Bond picture, the franchise seemed keen on reinventing itself with Moore and his different take on the secret agent. Rather than the suave styles of Sean, or the gritty gist of George, Roger went with a new direction for the Bond films: humor.

Don't get me wrong, Connery had his moments, but largely Connery's remarks were one-liners thrown at just the right time -- not all the time. What goes best with humor? Apparently nonsensical camp and self referencing dialogue! Live and Let Die was Michael Meyer's biggest inspiration for Austin Powers; that should tell you all you need to know.

As I already said, the movie was an odd one for an action spy thriller, let alone one like Bond. Live and Let Die is, ultimately, a supernatural Blaxploitation 70s B film which happens to have James Bond as the lead. Without James, the movie would work great and be considered a cult 70s classic; with him, it enters a whole new level of entertaining. This was a side (and type) of Bond never seen before to this extent, and changed the direction of the franchise from a more serious role to what we saw until Casino Royale came out to bring the series back to earth.

Ultimately, it's a fun romp and very entertaining. Is it a great movie? No. Is it an entertaining movie? No doubt. It's one of my favorite Bond films not because it breaks ground or has the best story, but because it's the most fun to watch and has one of the most intriguing characters in any Bond film before or since, Baron Samedi. (Plus it has the best Bond theme and opening sequence ever!)

Live and Let Die gets a bad wrap with a lot of fans because it doesn't take itself as seriously as Connery's films did, but faulting it for that would be no different than faulting Connery for making Bond too imposing of a figure to take over. No one could replace Connery as James Bond, so instead Roger Moore gave us a new direction for Bond to travel-one where a number of fine actors could replicate his persona on screen, and most importantly, entertain viewers.

Like the other older Bond films released on Blu-Ray, the video transfer does nothing astounding but does bring the quality up several notches. Colors are more vibrant, there's less grain and noise, blacks are deeper, and the little things are noticeable for the first time since theaters. It's a great presentation for an older movie, and if you have an HDTV and are a fan of Bond (or fun) it's a must-own not only for the quality of the film itself, but for the quality of the transfer.

Sadly, the audio is lacking in this one compared to the other five releases. While it's technically 5.1 and lossless, the levels could have been tweaked better. There were more times during this film that I had to adjust the volume to hear speaking (and lessen effect noise to a tolerable level for neighbors) than any of the other releases. It's a nuisance at most playing Volume Coach, but it's still one a viewer shouldn't have to go through multiple times throughout the film.

Once again, the extras on this Blu-Ray release are nothing new and are identical to the extras featured on previous DVD releases of this movie. While a few images here and there have been cleaned up or made in higher quality, for the most part it's exactly the same as if you had your DVD version from four years ago in the Blu-Ray player. A shame, but given that every Blu-Ray in this set is in the same boat (except Die Another Day which features less than the DVD releases) it's nothing surprising and shouldn't deter you from making a purchase.",1249689600,,3943,4.543661971830986
765505,4,6304037279,"Looking back, whenever the producers of Bond insert a new actor the movies tend to be some of the best for their respective era. Goldeneye was Pierce Brosnan's one great film. The Living Daylights was much better than License to Kill and Casino Royale was absolutely spectacular. Roger Moore's initial effort, on the other hand, came during a rather weak period following Sean Connery's one clunker, `Diamonds Are Forever' and preceding the strange and bland `Man With The Golden Gun'. The late 60's and early 70's were an era of experimentation for the U.S. and Britain and the Bond producers seemed to be getting with the times. None of the licensed Bond films are without redeeming qualities but some bury them deeper than others. LaLD has more than a few flaws but I have to say that it has improved with repeated viewings.

My biggest issue with the film is that when you get right down to it Mr. Big/Kananga is nothing more than a glorified drug dealer. It's no coincidence that two of my least favorite Bond films, this one and the abominable License to Kill both pit Bond against a drug kingpin. On the upside the casting is excellent and I have to give a special nod to Yaphet Kotto for his portrayal of Kananga and Jane Seymour is absolutely one of the most beautiful Bond girls ever. Julius Harris and Geoffry Holder were well cast as Kananga's henchmen Tee Hee and Baron Samedi. The one sore spot for me was the nauseating Clifton James as Sheriff Pepper who unfortunately makes an unwanted return in Golden Gun.

There are a few scenes in the movie that are done extremely well. One classic is when Bond walks into the all black `Filet o Soul' dressed in a long black coat with black gloves, parted haircut, speaking in his British accent. This may be the best fish out of water scene in all the Bond movies. After Bond stumbles into Mr. Big's trick booth and finds himself captured, Kotto delivers one of the best lines of any Bond movie. Bond begins to introduce himself and Big responds, `Names is for tombstones, baby! Y'all take this honkey out and WASTE HIM! NOW!' The line works absolutely perfect and establishes Mr. Big as a different kind of villain. Another great scene is when Mr. Big reveals that he and Kananga are the same person. Everything about it works, particularly Kananga testing of Solitaire to see whether or not she had slept with Bond. The plot of LaLD is a bit weak but the dialogue is well written. When Bond stumbles upon the villains underground lair Kananga is there waiting with Champaign in hand. `What shall we toast to?' he asks to which Bond replies, `An earthquake?' That is one of the few times I laughed out loud during a Bond movie.

Live and Let Die reminds me in some ways of the Man with the Golden Gun in that it seems a bit removed from the other Bond films. On some levels, including the terrific soundtrack, it works quite well. I was never a fan of Paul McCartney's title song but the rest of the music is great. I'm going to give the film a four and it may be a generous score but for some reason the film continues to grow on me unlike many of the more recent Brosnan films that seemed to lose something on repeated viewings.

There is one final scene I thought I would mention. After Bond is taken out to be `wasted' Kananga's henchmen take him to the slums of Harlem behind some buildings strewn with trash. One of the henchmen gives Bond a rough shove from behind prompting Bond to thank him. And he thanks him in a way that sounds 100% sincere. What really struck me about this scene was the realism of it. This was a legit, trash filled, crumbling section of Harlem. There is almost no color in this scene and the thought of Bond being executed in this terrible section of New York City always stuck with me. Again, the film is on the lower end of the Bond scale but there are moments that excel.",1240444800,2,3864,4.476595744680851
765506,3,6304037279,"LIVE AND LET DIE, the first James Bond film to star Roger Moore, often gets a bad rap among Bond fans. Stiff and too reliant on the one-liners, Moore was almost no one's favorite James Bond, and this entry in the series is one of the darkest... except for the long chase sequences (one, an extremely extended sequence involving speedboats jumping over dry land and a redneck Louisiana sheriff, would make you want to cringe if it didn't seem like part of a different film altogether.) It's racial politics are also very strangely handled, drawing perhaps too much from Ian Fleming's own bizarre fears about black Jamaican and American culture exploited in his novel on which the film is largely based. But there's much to recommend the film for: even though it draws heavily from popular culture fantasies of voodoo, it is one of the genuinely scariest Bond films, and the dramatic Paul McCartney and Wings theme song is used to fine effect throughout the film, especially in the scary sequence when the likable Gloria Henry, as Bond's first ever African-American romantic partner, realizes she's about to be killed by the villain Katanga (Yaphet Kotto). Geoffrey Holder is also very effective as one of Katanga's henchmen who disguises himself as Baron Samedi, and is featured in the film's final chilling shot. And then there is an extended sequence in a weed overgrown alley between a series of abandoned Harlem tenements that features some of the most breathtaking Gothic images in films of the period. Finally, in Jane Seymour as the prophetic Solitaire, it has one of the most memorable of all Bond women, particularly in that she's one of the more helpless ones (almost all the best Bond women other than Seymour are the ones who can actually fight, like Ursula Andress and Honor Blackman). True, her Seventies couture is often quite laughable, and so is one especially unfortunate chase sequence with Bond driving a double-decker bus while Seymour--for some unknown reason--sits sedately in the back. She has a lovely voice, however, that sounds properly uncanny when she reads her prophetic Tarot cards to Kotto. For all its faults, this is a hard film to forget.",1239062400,3,2172,4.937158469945355

765579,3,6304037279,"Two years after Sean Connery made his last official movie as James Bond, Roger Moore stepped into the role for his first of seven movies as 007.  When three agents are murdered under suspicious circumstances, one in New York, New Orleans and the Caribbean island of San Monique, 007 himself is called in to investigate.  All evidence leads to a UN delegate for San Monique, a Mr. Big, who may be working for a man called Katanga.  Bond begins to uncover a plot to distribute over two tons of heroine absolutely free, then Mr. Big can step in with all the thousands of new users.  A big chance from the Connery, and Lazenby entry, movies, Live and Let Die is an average Bond movie with above average action.  The whole movie has a different tone, but action scenes like a motorboat chase through the Louisiana bayous and a high speed car-chase with a double-decker boat are very memorable.  Some cool locations, a good title song from Paul McCartney and Wings, all contribute to a good, but not great Bond movie.

 Taking over for Sean Connery, Roger Moore steps in as James Bond, altering the character to a calmer, smoother 007 who is just as likely to throw off a one-liner instead of fighting.  Moore is good with the humorous scenes especially, but it does take some getting used to seeing anyone other than Connery playing the role.  To be fair though, Moore is still a good Bond.  Yaphet Kotto plays Mr. Big, a businessman looking to get insanely rich by distributing heroine for free all over the world.  Kotto isn't the most intimidating villain, he leaves that to henchmen Tee-Hee (Julius Harris) who has a claw arm, and voodoo doctor Baron Samedi (Geoffrey Holder).  In her first major role, the very beautiful Jane Seymour stars as Solitaire, Big's tarot reader who crosses her boss by even talking to Bond.  The supporting cast includes Clifton James as a Southern sheriff on Bond's trail, David Hedison as CIA agent Felix Leiter, Gloria Hendry as Rosie Carver, an agent who may be working both sides, and of course, Bernard Lee as ""M"" and Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny.

  The original DVD, rereleased several times in different formats with special features, is still the best with the movie in widescreen presentation, two commentaries, one with director Guy Hamilton and one with screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz, a 30-minute making of documentary, trailers, TV and radio spots, and several featurettes made during filming.

765582,3,6304037279,"Roger Moore made his cinematic debut as Ian Fleming's James Bond, Agent 007, in director Guy Hamilton's ""Live and Let Die,"" the eighth official entry in the Albert R. Broccoli & Harry Saltzman franchise for United Artists. Yaphet Kotto, Jane Seymour, David Hedison, and Geoffrey Holder co-starred with Moore in this above-average outing. Chiefly, the sudden rage in movies about African-American heroes prompted Broccoli & Saltzman to exploit the black angle to market the film's appeal across cultures. Moore ranks ""Live and Let Die"" as his second favorite 007 escapade after Lewis Gilbert's ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" In my opinion, however, ""Live and Let Die"" qualifies as above average as a movie, but least impressive as a Bond movie, edged out the ninth Bond opus, Guy Hamilton's ""The Man with the Golden Gun.""

Basically, nothing either surprising or electrifying occurs in this installment. Nevertheless, ""Live and Let Die"" boasts several assets, for example, the careening speed boat chase through the Louisiana bayous, Tom Mankiewicz's witty dialogue, the notorious villain's heroin trafficking scheme, the various predicaments that Bond finds himself in from Harlem to the Caribbean with voodoo witchcraft shading in the background, and Paul McCartney's Oscar nominated rock song title tune. Additionally, the editing by Bert Bates, Raymond Poulton, and John Shirley is exceptionally crisp.

""Live and Let Die"" featured a number of firsts for the James Bond franchise. The producers lensed this entry in 1.85.1 screen format, after they had converted to the Panavision widescreen process of 2.35.1 with ""Thunderball,"" ""You Only Live Twice,"" ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever."" The smaller screen ratio cramps the epic scale of adventure that made the previous James Bond sagas the larger-than-life series that it is. The producers sought to contrast Roger Moore's Bond from Sean Connery's. According to Mankiewicz, Connery was more aggressive while Moore was more suave. Moore smoked cigars rather than the cigarettes that Connery puffed. Bond receives his briefing his own flat under tense conditions rather than in at M's office. Moore shuns hats unlike Connery. Indeed, Moore appears in the gun-barrel sequence without headgear. Moore's Bond hang-glided here as well as in ""Moonraker."" Q is conspicuously absent from ""Live and Let Die."" Bond travels to an imaginary country for the first time, and Moore's Bond cuddles up with an African American woman, Rosie Carver (Gloria Hendry), 007's first interracial romance. Sheriff J.W. Pepper blurted out the first profanity in a Bond movie. George Martin produced an inferior orchestral score, compared to John Barry's superb scores. ""Live and Let Die"" also incorporated a supernatural theme, something that no other Bond has ever done.

The opening gambit qualifies as one of the least provocative. British agents at the United Nations in New York City, in the French Quarter in New Orleans, and in San Monique--a remote island in the Caribbean--die under mysterious circumstances. M barges in on Bond at 5:48 AM to brief him, while Miss Moneypenny helps a female Italian agent hide from M. No sooner does 007 lands in the Big Apple than Mr. Big (Yaphet Kotto of ""Across 110th Street"") sends his henchmen to kill him. They kill his driver with poisonous dart in New York traffic and our hero struggles to control his swerving car from the backseat. Later, Bond blunders into Harlem, walks into a trap at the Fillet of Soul restaurant, and encounters, Solitaire (Jane Seymour), who can predict the future. She works for Mr. Big, but she doesn't sleep with him. Actually, Mr. Big and Dr. Kananga, an island diplomat, are one in the same, but their dual personality doesn't come as much of a surprise. Nevertheless, the unmasking scene pre-dates Tom Cruise's ""Mission Impossible.""

Bond escapes from Mr. Big and meets an African-American CIA agent Rosie Carver in San Monique. Our hero escapes narrowly from a snake in his bathroom and wields a rather handy bottle of after-shave. When Bond gets rough with Rosie, Kananga has her executed. Eventually, Bond meets Solitaire again, makes love to her, and tries to help her escape. Since she is no longer a virgin, Solitaire cannot foretell the future so she flees with 007 to Louisiana. The double-decker bus scene is a revision of the ""Diamonds Are Forever"" car chase where the villains think that they have Bond cornered. Bond discovers that Mr. Big wants to give away a billion dollars worth of heroin to run the Mafia out of the junk business.

Momentarily, Bond eludes Mr. Big's thugs during an amusing chase around a hanger in a propeller-driven plane and later in a bayou boat chase that goes on too long but ends explosively. Bond and Mr. Big engage in hand-to-hand combat in Mr. Big's underground headquarters where he blows the villain to smithereens. Tee Hee (Julius Harris of ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"") makes a menacing villain with a steel pincer that can bend gun barrels. They tangle briefly on a train at the end. Clearly, their train tussle recalls Sean Connery's free-for-all with Robert Shaw in ""From Russia, With Love"" on the Orient Express and later Roger Moore's Donnybrook with Richard Kiel as Jaws in ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" Unfortunately, David Hedison does little more than deliver exposition as Felix Leiter. Sheriff J.W. Pepper--a forerunner to Jackie Gleason's redneck cop in the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" movies--is strictly comic relief and a little too broad. Actually, Pepper is a variation on the Las Vegas cop that pursues Bond down a back alley.

""Live and Let Die"" was above-average, but this PG-rated Bond lacked the tenacity of earlier Bond movies. Guy Hamilton helms the film with his usual smooth style, but ""Live and Let Die"" nor the next Bond in line ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" can compare with ""Goldfinger"" or ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Roger Moore came into his own with the vastly superior Bond epic ""The Spy Who Loved Me.""

Director Guy Hamilton's commentary track is worth listening to and so is Roger Moore's commentary.  This is simply a terrific must have DVD for loyal Bond fans!",1230422400,,6158,5.09009900990099

765640,1,6304037279,"I used to say live and let live. Then I saw this Roger Moore fiasco. It makes me give in and cry, This movie must die!...They had a job to do and didn't do it well, they put this fellow through hell!

Ok, enough of twisting Paul McCartney's great song to offer up my point of view. I am a recent convert to James Bond movies. I took a chance and watched Casino Royale and I was very impressed with what I saw. Then I picked up Goldfinger, followed by Die Another Day, GoldenEye, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, A View to a Kill, Dr. No, Octopussy, and The Living Daylights. Some of these movies were great and some were good or ok. But none of them made me do what this one did all by itself, none of the others made me put a temporary halt on my exploration of the Bond movies.

So where to start with this movie? Oh dear, where can I start? Since I am unable to stomach another viewing of this mess of a movie I'll just mention what sticks out in my mind. First of all the acting, mainly from the supporting cast, is so over the top and silly that it has clearly crossed the line into campiness. I grew up on Batman, especially reruns Adam West's portrayal of the character, so I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the 60s series. I could never understand why some Batman fans hated the series. But thanks to Live and Let Die it all has become perfectly clear. For someone like me, who loves Casino Royale, going back to this movie is like a Batman Begins fan picking up the Adam West Batman movie in their local store's cut out bin and hoping for more of the same. It may be possible for one to enjoy the movie, but if you don't know what you're in for, then you're likely to be disturbed by what you see. I was bothered enough that I feel like a survivor of this movie who is attempting to come to grips with what he suffered through.

Second of all are the characters involved in this production. (Well, one in particular mainly.)Ian Fleming made a bold move to have all black villains in his original novel. This caused some controversy of course and the film makers decided to attempt to counter act the move in an effort to appease the masses. How did they do this? By introducing an over zealous, white, redneck, stocky Southern Sheriff, complete with accent and chewing tobacco. I always wondered what inspired a TV series I enjoyed as a kid, the Dukes of Hazzard, and now I know. Yes, I am rather certain that we'd have no Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane if it hadn't been for the Sheriff in this movie. The big difference is that Coltrane fit in with the other characters instead of sticking out like a sore thumb.

The Sheriff here is one of the biggest, and most unwelcome, distractions to a movie since I endured Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars: Episode I several years back. In both cases I couldn't wrap my head around the thought process that was going through the minds of the people who gave a green light to what was going on once they saw the dailies of the films. A severe lack of sleep must have affected the judgments of these people.

The action sequences are rather dismal as well. We are treated to a battle between Bond and the Baron towards the end of the movie, but it is brief and hardly worth what you must sit through prior to this sequence. One of the longest action segments belongs to a boat chase. Long chases can be ok if they're well planned and shot in a manner that enhances the action, but that is not the case here. Instead the chase comes across as the film maker's effort to maximize the expense of obtaining the water craft used in this film.

My own review here is in danger of becoming as long and drawn out as the actual movie, so I'll end it here. I could go on and on about how bad this thing is, but I've wasted enough time on it already and saying more about it will never get back the two hours I spent with this badly done live action Disney cartoon.",1203379200,8,3906,4.222222222222222
765641,4,6304037279,"Fondly remembered by many as Moore's best effort, you have to be in the right mood to see this today and willing to make a mental trip back in time to the early 70s when it was made. It's probably dated more than almost any other Bond film - even bearing in mind that the seventies was the decade that fashion forgot, the sideburns and flares on display here are pretty vicious and, as the first film since Dr No to enter Bond's flat, it is deeply distressing to note that he is a slave to Formica and has chicken-shaped pate moulds on the wall. As swell as being the first Bond film since Goldfinger not to be shot in 2.35:1 widescreen, more significantly it also marks the point at which the series started imitating other trends rather than setting them - in this case blaxploitation pictures, which is quite an achievement you're your hero is white. Beyond its voodoo trappings little of the plot of Ian Fleming's novel survives as Shaft - sorry, Bond - takes on the drug-pushing president of a small island in Jamaica, but it's certainly one of the most action-packed of the series and never outstays its welcome the way some later efforts would.

Taking barely 11 minutes to get into some serious raised eyebrow action, there is perhaps a bit too much of Simon Templar in Moore's performance, but there is also a harder edge to his Bond that was soon smoothed away. He has a very cynical attitude towards Jane Seymour's virginal Solitaire), using her callously as bait. In a way it's a blessing that the film was not tailored specifically for Moore as later efforts would be, relying more on his rarely tapped abilities as an actor than his star persona. It doesn't hurt that director Guy Hamilton visibly raises his game from his lazy helming of Diamonds Are Forever.

This also shows the first sign of breaking up set pieces to add throwaway visual gags. This frequently detracts from the nifty and still very impressive speedboat chase, possibly the best sustained action sequence in the series until the free-running chase in Casino Royale, as Clifton James does his Deputy Dawg impersonation while the odd bit of slapstick comedy removes much of the threat. At times it is hard to tell which lines are meant to be funny and which ones aren't. ""Great disguise, Bond - white face in Harlem"" is pretty obviously the former, but surely the unintentional dialogue high point has to be Tony Award-winning Shakespearian actor Yaphet Kotto - curiously seeming to give three performances, starting out as Marlon Brando before easing into the genial villainy - uttering the immortal ""Names is for tombstones, baby. Take him out and waste him.""

The extras from the original DVD release are all retained - including the documentary with amazing outtakes of the alligator stunt going wrong that prove that the filmmakers used real gators - as well as some welcome new additions. The 1964 extract from Millicent Martin's TV show with a young Moore sending up James Bond is fun, and there's an intriguing 1973 documentary shot on the set. The print may be a damaged mixture of faded color and black and white footage, but the content more than compensates, from Moore quipping ""If Guy Hamilton thinks I'm doing that again, he can get the other feller back, I'm telling you"" to the depressing sign of the times that even then the film industry was still partially segregated, with the Black Stuntmen's Association having to prove that you didn't need blacked-up white stuntmen to double for black actors. The trailers are among the best of the series, promising 'More excitement, more action, more danger and more - much more - Roger Moore.' Better still, the legendary Milk Marketing Board commercial that was so cruelly undermined by Moore's entertaining account of filming Roger Moore as James Bond, is also included, featuring much manufactured footage of the cast downing pints of milk after dangerous stunts!

Highly recommended",1202860800,,3930,4.817777777777778

Other than the theme song, a cool voodoo/graveyard sequence and the alligator pond, this is one of the low points in the franchise. Short on action and exotic locals, but packed with ghetto slang, goofy characters and an overall lack of secret agent ""coolness"". The 1960's were at an end and this movie is just way too early 70's looking (and sounding). Overall it's more dated than Dr No (made 10 years prior) if that's even possible. The Spy Who Loved Me is the film that won me over as far as the Moore years go. This (for me) was a terrible start for Roger Moore.

765645,3,6304037279,"The first outing for Roger Moore (The Saint, The Persuaders) in Live and Let Die changed Bond from Connery's serious depiction to Moore's more humorous and English-gentlemanly type of Bond. In a nutshell, Roger Moore plays Roger Moore.

The first Bond films I ever saw where the Roger Moore ones, and even though I agree that Connery is the best Bond, there is a huge fun factor in Moore's Bond films that make them appealing to a larger and younger audience than Connery's, even though Moore's films were not as good as Connery's films. Roger Moore's Bond is a sort of suave Indiana Jones-type comedic movie, rather than the cold war paranoia and uber seriousness of the Bond films (and the original novels) that came before. Not that this is a totally bad thing, Moore helped bring in newer audiences which kept the franchise going through the seventies when it could have ran its course.

It is in this context that a fan or new-comer to Bond should see Live and Let Die, it is fun and a bit daft, but it knows it is (unlike Die Another Day, which was silly, but tried to be serious, and therefore ended up making the parody, Austin Powers, look like Funeral in Berlin).

Made in the early seventies, it is the first Bond film that departs from the typical megalomania and seems to delve into the world of drug dealers, at least initially. Cue 007 going to New York and entering what appears to be a blaxploitation flick, where Bond soon finds himself nearly assassinated.

It must be said that in real life would MI6 send a well-dressed, well-spoken vodka-martini drinking Englishman into a black ghetto neighbourhood to go `undercover'? This is especially true when Bond enters a voodoo shop dressed as a civil servant and asks the shop assistant to gift wrap a stuffed snake.

Things don't get much better for Bond as he encounters Mr Big, played by Yaphet Kotto, one of my favourite actors, who has a mischevious grin that makes him ideal as a OTT villain. Other baddies include a hook-handed grinning henchman named Tee Hee, played by Julius Harris, and a large formidable henchman called Whisper (who the actor, I think, was in Trading Places). Our Man also meets a lake of crocs and alligators (and, almost like a trademark, a tank of sharks). It is Moore's trademark, and his stiff upper lip, which makes him resort to the threats of these adversaries with nothing more than a dry remark and a raised eyebrow.

It isn't always bad for Bond; he meets a CIA agent called Rosie Carver, played by blaxploitation actress Gloria Hendry. However, it is Jane Seymour who plays the real love interest as Solitaire, a rather sweet and innocent tarot card reader whom the mysterious Mr Big needs desperately (and 'untouched').

I don't know why people complain that the film is racist, though I think it does have the usual stereotypes. Clifton James plays a redneck sheriff with the typical Churchillesque-bulldog grimace that only small town sheriffs have in Hollywood movies.

The locations vary as Bond moves from gritty Harlem to New Orleans, then to the sundrenched Caribbean, all at the poor British taxpayers expence. Bond's transport is rather dissapointing in that instead of having an Aston Martin, the total driving time in the movie is spent in an old double decker bus - which is great fun though. There is also a great speedboat chase as well.

The film is filled with flaws. The plot is far fetched and a bit daft - voodoo and Bond!? Moore smoking a cigar whilst paragliding was a bit unintentionally funny, along with him in the voodoo shop near the beginning.

To round the film off, we have a great title song by Paul McCartney that not only sums up Live and Let Die but also the whole Moore era, fun, energetic, and over the top. Not to be taken as seriously as Connery, which even Moore knew he couldn't surpass, but enjoyable all the same.",1196553600,,3861,4.673048600883653
765646,4,6304037279,"When Sean Connery finally left the Bond role for good (that is, until he returned for ""Never Say Never Again"" in 1983), it was up to veteran ""The Saint"" actor Roger Moore to take the reins.
""Live And Let Die"" has some strong elements going for it: A great theme song by Paul McCartney & Wings; a genuinely creepy backdrop of menace in the form of voodoo; and a gallery of bizarre/frightening characters. Yet, the film seems half-baked, as if it might have been better with Connery there. Moore, to his credit, plays Bond in his own tongue-in-cheek style, but he lacks the ruggedness of Connery. The plot finds some moments to place Bond in mortal danger (what are the odds that a team of crocodiles are going to conveniently line up so that Bond can run across their backs to safety??), yet Moore stretches credibility by making it look too easy (as was the case in future films).
Not Moore's best nor his worst, but an intriguing entry in the series.",1196208000,,951,4.534883720930233
765647,4,6304037279,"Sean Connery officialy retired from the Bond films (though he comes back for the ""Never Say Never Again"" film, which isn't even considered a true Bond film) in the 7th film of the series ""Diamonds are Forever"".  Roger Moore has become the new Bond in his first, and the 8th Bond film ""Live And Let Die"".  Roger Moore sports a refreshing and young look to Bond, and maybe a bit too young, demonstrating a role that is less impressive than what seemed to have come off as a natural for Connery.  But when one hates to compare, Moore is still impressive and creates a sucess (after all, he does return for 6 more films).  As for the Live and Let Die story, it would seem long gone is the unrealistic super-villain, actually replaced with a more natural and down-to-Earth type villain.  This is indeed a very different feel for a Bond film, but overall it is a welcome change that is still as fun and entertaining as any Bond film out there.

Live and Let Die is composed of an almost entirely black cast, which is another welcome change for a Bond film.  The villain is called Kanaga, who is in charge of a huge business in heroine smuggling.  He works out of an island in the Caribbean called San Monique (non-existent in the real world) and travels back and forth between there and New York City and New Orleans, where Bond vists throughout the film as well.  Kanaga's sidekick villain Tee-Hee is a most memorable villain, sporting a villainous 24 hour grin and a left-armed hook that can break and snap anything.  Kanaga's girl Solitaire is his primary means of comfort, using Tarot cards to see the future, both near and far.

The story can be a bit slow at times, and defintely lacks the depth and charm of prior Bond films.  Exotic  locales are also at a minimal.  A variety of shots in and around Jamaica are about the only landscape beauty we get to see (portraying the island of San Monique).  There are also many scenes in New York and uptown Harlem, and New Orleans - mainly fabulous scenes on the Bayou.  And a bonus, there is even a fun little scene at an actual crocodile farm.

Aside from certain villains, its the action that is the most memorable element of the movie.  A variety of action scenes begin to pickup the pace about mid-way through the film, but its the never-ending boat chase on the Bayou that is a complete stand-out.  This was a scene that I thought went well before it's time, and was played out very well, loaded with teriffic boat jumps and stunts.  I had never before seen boats skid as well on land as they did in this film.

Roger Moore has a way to go before he really begins to shine in the shoes of James Bond.  His first outing is a sucess, but he is not the most memorable thing to come out of Live And Let Die.  This is a toned down Bond story, but has excellent action to carry it on, as well as a catchy song title that topped the charts in its day ""Live And Let Die"".

765738,5,6304037279,"Paul McCartney wrote a catchy pop tune for this jaunty romp by James Bond and the usual suspects, though this Bond is a bit different in that it involves a somewhat more realistic scenario of events.  No cold war threat precipitated by some genetically aberrant, dysfunctional, one eyed, rubber gloved megalomaniac (with or without a cat) in this Bond flick.  Nope; this time around, it's a megalomaniacal drug lord who wants to rule the world, Kananga, played with homicidal bravado by Yaphet Kotto.  Hey, folks, whatever happened to Yaphet Kotto?  He's been on television a lot, but why hasn't he made more movies?
  So, here we have a relatively fresh Roger Moore, looking fairly youthful, suave, debonair, and physically able enough to play Bond.  The action starts off with three plausible murders of British Agents in different locales around the globe.  It's actually believable; well, except for the snake dance in the Caribbean where one of the agents is done in.  But, for the most part, it's not overblown.  I love the funeral procession in New Orleans where the band breaks out in a Dixie Land style number after one of the agents is murdered, and the agent is surreptitiously ensconsed in a coffin with a false bottom and carried away.
  The cast of characters provides much humor and even a scare or two. Julius Harris as Tee Hee is especially enjoyable with his nasty disposition and even nastier hook arm.  Ouch!  Yaphet Kotto is always good; hence my lament above.  ""Across 110th Street"" where are you?  Yeah, those were the days.  But, I digress.  This is a Bond movie and it's fun and frivolous like a Bond movie should be.  After all, we're not talking about Graham Greene or Robert Ludlum, or even Tom Clancy for that matter.  Bond movies should be fun and exciting, shouldn't they?  And this is one of the funnest.  The special effects were still done manually for the most part in those days.  I love the scene where Bond hops, skips, and jumps atop the bodies of several hungry alligators and crocodiles (when are alligators and crocodiles ever not hungry?) in his successful attempt to evade their snapping jaws. Mmmmm, mmm, good, tasty British Agent for dinner; Yummy!  I think a stunt man may actually have lost a foot or part of one performing that stunt; at least that was the rumor going around at the time.  Ah, yes, the excitement of real stunts performed by real people.  I also like the ending where Bond rams that super powerful aerosol device into the mouth of Kananga and he expands like a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon until he pops.  I wonder how Monsieur Kotto feels when he thinks back upon that scene. And I like the second ending during the epilogue, after all the derring do is supposedly finished and it's time for Bond to have a little R&R with his girlfriend, where he encounters Tee Hee on the train and, after a struggle, incapacitates him by clipping the wires of his mechanical arm, and then thrusting him out of the train window.
  Without belaboring the point, this is a Bond movie and pretty much follows the Bond movie formula: Once again Bond is summoned from his bed and love interest du jour to save the world from the exploits of evil men; Bond fights evil men; Bond meets various women and seduces them; Bond meets Main Squeeze and seduces her; Bond defeats evil men; Bond and Main Sqeeze bed down for the end of the film.  So it goes. Hey, I like this movie.  Unless you have lived in a cave for the past thirty years, I'm sure you've seen this flick at least once.  And, unless you have no sense of humor you can't help but like this film.
  The high speed boat chase around the bayous of Louisiana is a vintage chase scene a la the best film chase scenes, and on the water no less. Sheriff J.W. Pepper, The redneck sheriff, played to the hilt by Clifton James, milks the scene with tobacco spitting, scenery chewing bravado.  It's a great time.  And, of course, Bond wins as always.  This was a time when critics and audiences welcomed some levity and ridiculousness in the Bond series; and before the ridiculousness became banal, expected, and tiresome.  And the levity was a welcome change after all the ultra-seriousness of the Connery Bond films, at least by yours truly.  Also, Sir George Martin of Beatles fame wrote the score for this one.  It's one of the few scores not written by John Barry (at least at the time) and it's quite good.
  This film is notable for the pop hit tune, ""Live and Let Die,"" by Paul McCartney, which still has a catchy ring and staying power today. The title captures the Bond aura perfectly and delineates the James Bond, ""007, License to Kill"" persona supremely.  Everybody is young in this movie. Of course they're young; this flick was made over thirty years ago.  I especially like to watch films that I initially saw when I was much younger mainly to marvel at the youthfulness of the actors and actresses; and to see who may or may not have had plastic surgery since.  Yeah, well, I'm getting old just like everybody else.  Come to think of it, someone should get either Roger Moore or Sean Connery to reprise the role and cast no one under the age of 70.  That would be a hoot. The resulting film might be titled:  ""007: Golden Ager.""
  In conclusion, this movie is a ""purely escapist, nonsensical, turn your brain off for a couple of hours"" diversion.  It's probably the only film in the series where some guy refers to James Bond as Jim when Bond is hijacked in a taxi cab by one of the evil drug thugs. I also like the mysterious bald guy, Geoffrey Holder of ""7-Up, Uncola"" fame, as Baron Samedi, or, for those of you who took high school french, ""Baron Saturday."" He dances around with snakes and enigmatically appears and disappears throughout the film and winds up sitting on the front of the train locomotive at the end of the film, wearing that exquisite top hat, and laughing his wonderfully sonorous, reverberating laugh.  There's magic, which hints at Voodoo, and some clever dialogue throughout the film and, as usual, Bond gets the girl, a young, very pretty Jane Seymour this time around, starring in her first film as the mystic virgin fortune teller, Solitaire, who loses her powers after 007 seduces her. Lucky girl.  There's always a silver lining, right?
  As for the new issue and the digital remastering of the film and all the extra junk that is included on the DVD, I don't really care about that stuff as long as the movie is sharp, clear, and crisp, which it is.

765739,3,6304037279,"The Spy Who Loved Me is the bond film where Roger Moore finally nailed the Bond character. This film has a lot going for it. The positive is Moore although already 45 was at the peak of his looks, so his youthful appearence is quite enjoyable to see. Secondly the wonderful Jane Seymour as Solitaire. Yaphet Kotto as kananaga. All around casting good. The bus chase and boat chase are amazing. However, the film is dated by the emphasis on the Superfly persona of the time. It also has Bond going after a drug kingpin rather than the usual meglmaniac. Although the drug plot is refreshing. Moore is a little wooden at times and he ssems to be living under Sean Connerys shadow although this was his first time. Th ecinematagrophy is not panavision.",1191196800,,748,4.58955223880597
765740,3,6304037279,"Moore's first movie successfully makes the transition into 70's, with flares, jazz, afro's and all, intact.  It's an extension of the Americanisation that started in Diamonds are Forever, and a lot of it works - at least well enough to establish Roger Moore as the new Bond quite painlessly.  His is a different Bond - more suave, less fisticuffs, more one liners.  But the story lurches from new ideas to old standards in hesitant fashion, ultimately ending unsatisfyingly.
There are some very memorable set-pieces, but there is a lot missing from the mix too.  The plot line meanders and never seems to present a particularly threatening atmosphere.  SPECTRE and Blofeld are rather missed, as the franchise struggles to find a replacement protagonist for the new decade.  After megalomaniacs trying to achieve world domination, a drugs baron (Mr Big, played by Yaphett Koto) somehow seems tame by comparison.
Moore is often criticised for bringing too much levity to the series - but the one liners roll easily from his tongue (amazingly, given how firmly entrenched it is in his cheek).  However, for every plus in the humour stakes, something is lost in the action stakes - Moore was never convincing in the running and fighting.  The final train compartment fight in the coda is ok, but pales compared to the classic similar scene in `From Russia...'  In this movie, although older than Sean Connery, with careful editing, he just about holds his own as a credible action hero.
It is over half way through the movie as your eyelids may be drooping, that the movie really kicks into gear, with `that' boat chase.  It's action packed, with great stunts and humour throughout, in large part due to Sheriff W Pepper.  Other than the colourful Sheriff, in terms of characters, women are given a bit of a bum deal, either whimpering Jane Seymour falling instantly for Bond's charms thanks to a rather ungentlemanly piece of cheating, or Rosie Carver who is portrayed as the most useless CIA agent ever (although Bond gamely offers to `lick her into shape').  Yaphet Koto however is a credible Bond villain- even when he cannot decide whether to be something from a Blaxploitation movie, or the Blofeld clone he sounds like in the final few scenes of the movie, in the inevitable underground lair.
It is this switch from high octane powerboat chase to disappointingly old fashioned finale, that ultimately lets the film down.

For this ultimate edition, the usual professional job has been done in restoring both picture and sound, with the dts mix being near flawless and never too clver, and the picture just perfect.  All the extras from the Special Edition are present, with just a couple more - this time, an interesting curio - an excerpt from a 1964 comedy sketch where Moore plays Bond!  Also a vintage but quite well done 1973 vintage documentary.  The original `Inside Live and Let Die' and the feature commentary are still the must see highlights.
As a package then, good enough to introduce a new Bond, while Moore was still young enough to fill Bond's shoes.  It has scenes worth waiting for, but is certainly not one of Bond's finest moments.",1190073600,,3154,4.865420560747664
765741,4,6304037279,Roger Moore is my favorite Bond. This one is not one of the best Bond movies he has done but it still gets four stars in my book. In this movie Bond goes to Louisiana among other places to find out why three agents have been killed. It all stems from a drug lord who has connections with pimps and those who deal in voodoo/black magic.  It has the famous boat chase through the bayou (with the sheriff chasing behind them) as well as the alligator farm that could be the end of Bond....Anyways this movie has a lot of action and a good story. It is a must have for any Bond fan as well as those who just love Roger Moore,1189123200,,620,4.040650406504065

Can james Bond stop and evil Drugs lords plains of evil and corruption. You'll find out in this 1973 adventure flicks thrilling conclusion. This movie filled with plenty of action and more beautiful young girls than I have ever seen in previous Bon films.  I recommend this movie for people ages 9 to 105 and up due to mild violence, mild sexuality, and some ethehical and religious content that might be offesive or inappropriate to those under the age of 9 or have super strong moral beliefs.",1185494400,,628,4.548672566371682

Over the years i've heard some people criticize Roger Moore's version of 007 (his Bond is a joke, blah blah blah), but I enjoyed his version just as much as I enjoyed the more serious versions played by Connery & Dalton.  His humerous touch was worked in well with the action that we've come to expect from the James Bond movies.  Yaphet Kotto was excellent in his role as Kananga and I loved both ""Bond Girls"" (Jane Seymour & Gloria Hendry) in their roles as Solitaire & Rosie Carver, respectively.

Such a departure of what made the seried great. And it does not go the series justice. Better than the extrememly lame Moonraker.

Jane Seymour makes a lovely addition as Miss Solitaire.  Yaphet Kotto makes for a smooth and menacing dual role as Kananga and Mr. Big.  The late Julius Harris is totally ""disarming"" as towering henchman Tee Hee.  Geoffrey Holder (The Un-Cola Guy) has the time of his life as undead henchman Baron Samedi.  Clifton James is funny and more tolerable here as redneck Sheriff J. W. Pepper, than his reprisal in The Man With the Golden Gun.  David Hedison is the best yet cast as Bond's CIA pal Felix Leiter.

765796,3,6304037279,"Given the success and rage of blaxploitation films in the early 1970s, the producers decided to jump on the bandwagon in order to take the series in a new direction with LIVE AND LET DIE.  It is, in many ways, a shocking film in how far away from the original mold it takes the series.  This is particularly strange given that Guy Hamilton (who churned out GOLDFINGER, one of the best Bond films).  For starters, we have a new Bond in the form of Roger Moore.  He has his detractors and his supporters, splitting roughly along the divide of what people want out of the films: suspense & espionage or fantastic action & humor.  If you love the latter, Roger Moore delivers in spades, his tongue firmly set in his cheek and an army of one-liners at the ready.  LIVE AND LET DIE focuses on action and humor, Bond having become a sort of ridiculous character by now.  For my tastes, Connery had the ability to hold the series just above the ridiculous, whereas by Bond's eighth outing, he is drowning in it.  Additionally, the film has a decidedly blaxploitationist theme.  Bond is now dealing with a black heroine supplier, surrounded by an army of jive-talking black henchmen, complete with pimp suits, ""pimpmobiles,"" and Shaft attitude.  Perhaps some will enjoy this lively romp through 1970s culture.  Others might even congratulate the producers for being so timely and capitalizing on the trend.  But it horribly dates the film, while at the same time making LIVE AND LET DIE look cheap and cheesy.

After the opening ""gun barrel"" sequence (now, of course, featuring Roger Moore), we are immediately taken to the United Nations, where we witness the interesting assassination of a British representative.  We quickly cut to a New Orleans funeral march and again witness the assassination of another agent.  Finally, we are taken to an island called San Monique and witness the voodoo killing of a third man, tied to a stake.  It is a short opening teaser and Bond is notably absent.  The opening titles follow in the voodoo theme, featuring a skull in flames and the bodies of black women with painted designs.  McCartney's theme is fantastic and is definitely one of the stronger songs in the entire series.

The plot of LIVE AND LET DIE is rather down-to-earth, but with certain elements blown out of proportion to render the film an over-the-top feel.  Several British agents have been killed (in the opening teaser) who were monitoring the operations of a certain Dr. Kananga (Yaphet Kotto), the dictator of a small Caribbean island called San Monique.  Bond travels to New York, the site of the first assassination, where Kananga is visiting the UN.  Upon arrival, Bond once again meets up with Felix Leiter of the CIA.  (Interestingly, in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, Leiter is noticeably not fond of Bond and is exasperated by his antics.  But here, there is no such animosity.  They are best of friends again).  Bond soon finds himself in the clutches of Mr. Big, a man known as Kananga's US gangster connection, who runs a chain of ""Fillet of Soul"" restaurants throughout the country.  It is here that Bond first meets his girl Solitaire (Jane Seymour), a beautiful tarot reader who has the ability to predict the future.  It is Solitaire's ability that has enabled Mr. Big and Kananga to stay one step ahead of Bond's operations.  Bond manages to escape and travels to San Monique to track down Kananga.  He seduces Solitaire (in addition to his contact Rosie Carver (Gloria Hendry)) and finally figures out Kananga's plans.  Kananga has produced two tons of heroine on his secret plantation, guarded against invasion by secret nets and the islanders' fear of voodoo and the occult (reminiscent of the islander's fear of Dr. No's ""dragon"" in DR. NO).  Kananga plans to distribute the heroine in the United States for free, both flooding the market to put his competitors out of business while at the same time doubling the number of addicts in the country.  With the mob out of the way, Kananga will be able to run the heroine business in the US for many years to come.  That is, of course, unless Bond can foil his plans!

LIVE AND LET DIE is notable for the down-to-earth nature of its evil villain.  Neither Blofeld or SPECTRE is anywhere to be seen.  We no longer have an evil supervillain capable of crushing the world in a single blow.  Instead, we have a drug-trafficker who wants to rule the market.  Of course, he is a drug trafficker who has an incredibly elaborate hideout and an incredibly elaborate operation.  (Though, why it is so elaborate is never really understood, other than the need for Bond to fight a villain of some size, power, and eccentricity.)  Another feature of LIVE AND LET DIE that pops out is the explicit attempt to make Roger Moore's Bond different from Sean Connery's.  Bond never orders a martini throughout the entire film (he prefers bourbon with no ice).  The mission briefing occurs in Bond's private residence and Q makes no appearance whatsoever (although, he is referred to in reference to Bond's electromagnetic watch).  Finally, Bond no longer has his cigarette case, choosing to smoke cigars instead.  It is all a bit jarring.

Another funny aspect of the film occurs during the terrific boat chase sequence.  The sequence is really quite spectacular and is certainly worthy of a Bond film.  But for some strange reason, the producers decided to insert Sherriff J.W. Pepper (Clifton James), a stereotypical dim-witted Southern sheriff who seems to be the inspiration for Sheriff Buford T. Justice of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT fame.  In fact, I felt like I was in a prequel to the BANDIT series during this whole escapade, in which this ignorant Southern sheriff attempts to catch Bond in a high-speed chase, only to be foiled by various wrecks and problems (supposedly to the audience's delight).  It's clearly meant to be a bit of comic relief, I suppose, but it falls flat.  Just like Kananga's henchman Tee Hee (Julius Harris) falls flat with his ridiculous looking metal pincer hook.  Just as Kananga's shark pool (why does he have sharks?) and the ""explosive"" ending falls flat.

Roger Moore ushered in a new era for Bond films.  The action in LIVE AND LET DIE is, on the whole, quite good.  The stunts are great and the pursuit sequences are particularly fun.  But Bond is a bit light for my tastes here.  I preferred the Bond films when they took themselves more seriously and tried to create suspense.  This is escapist entertainment.  Thus, if you enjoyed the Roger Moore era, you will enjoy LIVE AND LET DIE.  The Ultimate Edition looks much fantastic and the sound is great.  Included are a number of documentaries about the making of the film, as well as various footage of Moore on the set.  It all comes down to what you want from Bond.  There is no way to achieve perfect continuity throughout a film series that spans decades and involves several different actors in the lead role.  If you enjoyed the class of the Connery films, you will probably not like the change evidenced here.  But if you're willing to accept a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek Bond, Roger Moore certainly delivers.  I prefer Connery.  But to each his own.",1174608000,6,7192,4.7887896019496345

765798,4,6304037279,"This James Bond movie was a movie of multiple firsts. The first James Bond movie with a real rock song as the theme (""Live and Let Die"" by Paul McCartney and Wings); it was the first major role for beautiful Jane Seymour; it was the first Bond movie where he was after someone other than someone out to take over the world; and of course it was the first Bond movie with Roger Moore in the title role.

Some of the firsts worked really well. Jane Seymour is always lovely and in this movie she was in her early 20s, looking absolutely stunning in a variety of costumes. The song by Wings is one of their most memorable and well-known. The other firsts had varying levels of success.

Roger Moore rolled James Bond back from the continuous one-liners doled out by Sean Connery in ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" which was welcomed and at least temporarily prevented James Bond movies from becoming spy comedies. This Bond movie also temporarily abandoned the science fiction theme of the last couple of Bond movies under Sean Connery. However, as good a bad guy as Yaphet Kotto played, ultimately he was still a drug dealer and seemed barely a worthy adversary for Bond.

The other semi-welcomed change is the increased action of this movie. While the movie is advertised as being non-stop action, which it is, I wonder whether too much action is possible. Sean Connery's Bond generally had a well developed story to back him up, with ever-increasing plot complexity. It seems that much of the intellectual complexity was thrown out in this movie for the sake of continuous car and boat chases. Yet with all that, this movie is still a good Bond movie. Not the best, but not the worst either. The boat chase through Louisiana is exciting with at several novel crashes.

One thing I did not mention earlier is that this movie turned out to be an excellent vehicle for a number of African-American actors. In addition to Yaphet Kotto, Geoffrey Holder and Julius Harris played very memorable supporting roles. Gloria Hendry as Rosie Carver is also a very memorable African-American actor, as she was the first African-American Bond girl; Bond's kiss must have seemed somewhat shocking to audiences of 1973, not to mention when he made love to her. The one flaw in all this is that African-Americans seemed to have gotten all the criminal roles, and very few of the law enforcement roles (only one that I can recall). While having equal opportunity as criminals, people of color should have been more dispersed on both side of the line.

With all its flaws, this movie still turns out to be a decent entry in Bond filmography. Roger Moore brings the style of ""The Saint"" to James Bond, which was certainly a change for Bond. Furthermore, the opportunity was taken to bring Bond somewhat back to earth. Admittedly the elements of the supernatural, introduced for the first time in any Bond movie, were a bit unusual, but just as consistent as the science fiction in the previous Bond movies. Overall I would say this movie was an improvement over ""Diamonds Are Forever"", and certainly worth a bowl of popcorn.

765799,3,6304037279,"In comes Roger Moore in 'Live And Let Die', sophisticated, suave and with the best delivery of the line 'Bond, James Bond' to date. Roger Moore's performance is avant garde, filled with biting wit and delicious sarcasm. You can tell in his behaviour, just by the looks he throws in different situations, that this Bond is always thinking, analyzing and reacting. Bond is the character not the actor. But when an actor portrays the essence of a character through his acting and not just his physicality, he is more successful. Through careful analysis, Roger Moore is the more interesting Bond, so far and the funniest in a subtle and effective way.  This makes a difference in the world of entertainment; Moore entertains. The film itself is well paced and has lots of wit and humour but Hamilton has lost the modern edge with 'Diamonds Are Forever' and now with 'Live And Let Die'. This does not make the film fall short of being entertaining and engaging. It also serves up plenty of inventive action and very interesting character actors with great performances.

Of course one has to take intoacoount that it was made in the early 70's and it portrays a feeling of the period but still the producers tried to make Moore different in every aspect from Connery. I am not a fun of Roger Moore but this film is quite interesting as it is the closest that  the series has ever come into becoming a cult film. An extra bonus are the scenes shot in the grand old south that are quite interesting.,1172188800,,482,4.182795698924731
765801,5,6304037279,"When George Lazenby finally decided to relinquish the role of James Bond, the search was on for his successor.  Eventually, Roger Moore was awarded the role.  Oh, wait just a second--I almost forgot...there was a very strange blip in between.  Upstart Sean Connery played the role for one movie, Diamonds Are Forever, and then quit.  And we were all left imagining what sort of film Diamonds Are Forever could have been if George Lazenby had stayed on for just one more.  Ah, right.  That's how it all went.

Enter Roger Moore.  And what sort of film did they give him to debut in?  Well, the way I see it, Live And Let Die, for all of its strange trappings, its hip coolness, its heroine, its Tarot cards that really predict the future, its funky outfits, its lack of Q, is at heart, a traditional Bond flick to be treasured.  If you aren't really going to tamper with the formula, then fool everyone by making it look as if you're tampering with the formula.  This is Roger Moore before he used the James Bond films as one long audition for Cannonball Run: a bit more serious, a bit more intense, in control of when things turn humourous rather than at the mercy of bad sound-effects when cars do loop-de-loops while jumping twisted bridges, or Beach Boys music erupting during snowboard stunts.  Here, some of the supporting characters handle the comedy-relief, like the wonderfully inept Rosie Carver, and the immortal Sheriff J. W. Pepper, who manages to steal the show during the boat chase.  Moore, as Bond, mainly gets down to business.

Apparently, both Yaphet Kotto and Jane Seymour tend to swear off this film--like mentioning Grease 2 to Michelle Pfeiffer, or Police Academy 7 to Claire Forlani (or Christopher Lee, or Ron Perlman).  Didn't someone from the Howard Stern radio show get the cold shoulder from Kotto when he mentioned how Kotto's villain, Mr. Big/Kananga, is always blowing up at Solitaire and Bond?  And didn't Jane Seymour stop right in the middle of an episode of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman to insert the line ""I did Live And Let Die only for the money, people.""?  (Okay, that may just have been Bistro 990 gossip.)  Regardless of any actor rejecting their contribution to this Bond gem, Kotto is superbly shark-like throughout, and Jane Seymour makes a wonderful lasting impression as the Bond girl who wants to remain a virgin so she can read Tarot Cards for a vicious heroine giver-awayer with long-range plans for incredible profit after his clever, freebie ""Just Say Yes"" campaign.  Enter James Bond.

There's the boat chase, of course.  I mentioned it already.  Yes, it is a great boat-chase--but again, it has its eccentricities that only make it better.  As indicated, the boat chase, slick and exciting as it is, is broken into weird pieces by Sheriff J. W. Pepper pursuing all those crazy boats, while being restricted to his police-car on land.  But that's okay, because occasionally the boats are chasing each other on land too.  Also, characters like to switch boats at different points in the chase, pit-stop in swimming pools, and interrupt weddings while in boats--and then when we're up to full speed once more, we stop again for Sheriff J. W. Pepper and one of his roadside rants, or while he switches cars.  All of this lunacy rips the pace of the boat chase to shreds, but that's what makes it so amazingly cool.

Other cool stuff: Bond getting suckered twice at the Fillet Of Soul club, the death-trap at the alligator-farm (which does not involve sharks--sharks, later), sadistic henchman Tee Hee breaks a string or two and no doubt loses his place in the orchestra (can he play with a broken string?), and Solitaire asks for Lesson Number Three (I guess she has no complaints).

This is tradional Bond, albeit with a new leading man, dressed up in cool clothes.  It feels a little different than usual, but it's fast and fiendish, and one of my favourites.  A swirl of campiness and nasty venom, that goes down just right.",1171152000,2,3974,4.7507288629737605
765802,3,6304037279,"'Live and Let Die' is the only film that matches Bond exclusively against African-American drug czars... It is the only other movie besides 'Dr. No' with no briefing with Q, no meeting in M's office, and no musical score from the great John Barry...

Bond is called to investigate the deaths of the three British spies... He is menaced by a venomous snake in his hotel room, and cornered in the middle of a pool full of alligators... He stumbles upon a heroin trade operation presided by two contrasting personalities, Dr. Kananga and Mr. Big...

Yaphet Kotto is ruthless and calculating as the black master criminal... His position is shored up by the application of fortune-telling and magic charms... Under the alias of Harlem hood Mr. Big, Kananga plans to flood the US with free heroin... His entourage includes the mystical Baron Samedi (Geoffrey Holder) who may or may not be a supernatural being, and Tee Hee (Julius W. Harris) one of the best henchmen in a Bond film... Tee Hee is an intimidating giant enforcer with quite a 'right hand'... He seems amused by 'the least little thing,' after he twists Bond's gun barrel...

Before he became James Bond on screen, Roger Moore was a successful television actor who was respected for his work in such series as ""Maverick,"" ""The Persuaders,"" and, especially, ""The Saint.""

In his first appearance as 007, Moore wears a refined black jacket, dark gloves, and a magnetic wristwatch... He carries a shark gun that fires compressed-air bullets, and drinks the martini shaken not stirred... He enjoys a large cigar after a hot bath... He tries hard to conceal the presence of his early ""guest,"" and goes into trouble when he tricks a mystical mistress using a fake deck of tarot cards... He claims to be a 'gentleman' when he refuses to tell his interrogator whether or not he's deflowered his chaste priestess... He becomes highly in danger in the land of black magic and fetishes...

Jane Seymour looks innocent in the ways of the world... She is lovely as the clairvoyant heroine Solitaire, whose powers fade after being romanced by the suave, and handsome English 007 Spy...

Rosie Carver is Playboy bunny Gloria Hendry, the weak CIA agent whose loyalty is controlled by a few bloody feathers...

Madeleine Smith is the voluptuous Miss Caruso who's undone by Bond's sheer magnetism... She is seduced with the aid of a watch that magnetically tugged down her zipper...

This eighth James Bond film is an entertaining spy adventure which went so far as to fail to include Q, forever played by actor Desmond Llewelyn...",1168041600,,2774,4.825263157894737

765852,4,6304037279,"And none the worse for it, since every Bond film needs a fresh spin on the same old formula. Roger Moore's first outing as JB is, in equal measures, comical and action-packed. You'll never get bored. But it's definitely the weirdest Bond ever with loads of utterly bizarre moments.

It begins with M turning up at JB's house in the early hours while he's pumping some Italian agent for information (don't you just love his initialed dressing gown). Before sending him to America to investigate a Harlem pimp known as Mister Big he delivers some gadgets from Q-Branch, including a very useful watch. Q himself, or Major Boothroyd if you want to call him by his proper name, doesn't make any appearance in this one.

Standing out like a Muslim in an airport, almost every single black person JB encounters in Harlem is on Mister Big's payroll. And they've got a seemingly endless bag of tricks to play on him. The funny thing about Moore is that he's very proper and British and doesn't think anything of walking into a tough Harlem bar while dressed up like the Duke of Edinburgh. His stunned reactions when they mess with his head are seriously funny.

The action then moves to Louisiana and a savage Caribbean island as JB uncovers a massive heroin plot. There's a particularly long speedboat chase across a bayou where JB encounters Sheriff J.W. Pepper, the most stereotypical southern redneck ever. Think of Texas Businessman from The Simpsons and you get the idea. JB also gets to dodge a hundred hungry Gators and do, many times over, Solitaire, Mister Big's Tarot card reader.

I'm not sure what kind of formidable villain uses a Tarot card reader to help him do business but when you also surround yourself with a hook-handed maniac called Tee-Hee, a quiet fat guy called Whisper and a seemingly unkillable voodoo high priest called Baron Samedi then you really do become a serious baddie. Right? He even goes on a big speech about how his master plan works before attempting to kill JB slowly. Obviously this makes much more sense than just shooting him right away. When will they learn?

Despite being the oldest actor to debut as Bond (at 46), Moore does look younger than Connery. And while Sean was gruff and Scottish, Moore is perpetually calm and refined, even in the face of danger (fingers being chopped-off, snake in the bath, being eaten by gators/sharks). Everything that the British once thought they were. He has a certain sarcastic edge that the other Bond actors lacked. While some of his films may have been the sillier of the franchise, Moore has always been my favorite. And the massive revolver and holster he uses at the end is so much more masculine than the usual, wimpy as hell, Walther PPK.

And, as much as I am no fan of Paul McCartney, you gotta love that theme song! Exciting and iconic at the same time. And also yet another juxtaposition in the weirdest Bond movie ever.

MI6, Harlem, Pimps, Paul McCartney, Gators, Heroin, Voodoo, Snakes, Sharks, Clairvoyance, Rednecks, Afros, Fake Afros, Fillet of Soul, Human Sacrifice, Scarecrows and a small-headed man in a Top-Hat who lost a fight with chickens. Is this a Bond film or did the whole world just go insane?

765856,4,6304037279,"Live and Let Die is one of the most overlooked Bond films.  Connery die-hards tend to abhor Mr. Moore, but his era, taken on its own merits, has quite a bit of fun to offer.  Particularly for latter-day Generation X kids (born in the 70's), Roger Moore was the first Bond they got to know, and just as `legitimate' as Connery's portrayal.

The film takes various liberties with the original Fleming plot: Here, a multinational heroin operation is the scheme Bond has to foil, as opposed to smuggled gold coins; the scheme's country of origin is now the fictional caribbean isle of San Monique instead of Haiti; head villain Mr. Big is given the alter-ego of Dr. Kananga, prime minister of San Monique.  The original novel, first published in 1954, arguably had dated/offensive depictions of black Americans and Caribbean culture, and was updated in screenplay by Tom Mankiewicz (who contributed to other Bond films, as well as the first two Superman features).

Aside from Bond, the main cast includes familiar faces Bernard Lee as M, and Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny.  Jane Seymour makes her film debut here as Solitaire, the mysterious tarot-reader and advisor to Kananga.  Paul McCartney's title song became a classic-rock staple, but viewers should take note of a scene where a lounge singer performs a Soul interpretation.

The towering henchman Baron Samedi is played by the stage-trained Trinidadian Geoffrey Holder, who went on to  win two Tony awards in 1974 (for directing & choreography, respectively), and even `greater' acclaim as a 7-Up pitchman.

Another formidable foe, the metal-clawed Tee-Hee, is played by Julius Harris.  He was a regular in several black-action genre films, with roles in Superfly, Black Caesar, Trouble Man, and more, eventually playing Idi Amin in a TV film by the end of the decade.

Clifton James is hilarious as the boisterous, chaw-spitting Sheriff J.W. Pepper.  Broadly played, he would show up again in The Man with the Golden Gun.

The fight scenes and the chase scenes are very good, especially the boat race in the New Orleans bayou.

In this writer's estimate, there are some minor quibbles to be found:

1- Bond's gadget-master Q doesn't show up here; instead, M himself hands Bond a high-tech watch that will come in handy throughout the film.

2- Kananga/Mr. Big isn't as fleshed out as he could have been.  It would have been interesting if more of his background had been revealed.

3- The final confrontation with Bond seems a little rushed (at least Scaramanga made time to chat with Bond over dinner before staging the `final' deathtrap).  Dated special effects make the demise of the head villain unintentionally humorous.

Skeptics may decry Connery's absence, the bandwagon-jumping onto black-action (though several settings & characters legitimately come from the novel), and the vague camp sensibilities inserted into the series, but overall, this was a satisfying beginning to the Moore era of Bond.",1159142400,3,2960,5.074380165289257

765861,4,6304037279,"This James Bond movie was a movie of multiple firsts. The first James Bond movie with a real rock song as the theme (""Live and Let Die"" by Paul McCartney and Wings); it was the first major role for beautiful Jane Seymour; it was the first Bond movie where he was after someone other than someone out to take over the world; and of course it was the first Bond movie with Roger Moore in the title role.

Some of the firsts worked really well. Jane Seymour is always lovely, and in this movie she was in her early 20s, looking absolutely stunning in a variety of costumes. The song by Wings is one of their most memorable and well-known. The other firsts had varying levels of success.

Roger Moore rolled James Bond back from the continuous one-liners doled out by Sean Connery in ""Diamonds Are Forever"", which was welcomed and at least temporarily prevented James Bond movies from becoming spy comedies. This Bond movie also temporarily abandoned the science fiction theme of the last couple of Bond movies under Sean Connery. However, as good a bad guy as Yaphet Kotto played, ultimately he was still a drug dealer and seemed barely a worthy adversary for Bond.

The other semi-welcomed change is the increased action of this movie. While the movie is advertised as being non-stop action, which it is, I wonder whether too much action is possible. Sean Connery's Bond generally had a well developed story to back him up, with ever-increasing plot complexity. It seems that much of the intellectual complexity was thrown out in this movie for the sake of continuous car and boat chases. Yet with all that, this movie is still a good Bond movie. Not the best, but not the worst either. The boat chase through Louisiana is exciting with at several novel crashes.

One thing I didn't mention earlier is that this movie turned out to be an excellent vehicle for a number of Black actors. In addition to Yaphet Kotto, Geoffrey Holder and Julius Harris played very memorable supporting roles. Gloria Hendry as Rosie Carver is also a very memorable Black actor, as she was the first Black Bond girl; Bond's kiss must have seemed somewhat shocking to audiences of 1973, not to mention when he made love to her. The one flaw in all this is that Blacks seemed to have gotten all the criminal roles, and very few of the law enforcement roles (only one that I can recall). While having equal opportunity as criminals, people of color should have been more dispersed on both side of the line.

With all its flaws, this movie still turns out to be a decent entry in Bond filmography. Roger Moore brings the styling of ""The Saint"" to James Bond, which was certainly a change for Bond. Furthermore, the opportunity was taken to bring Bond somewhat back to earth. Admittedly the elements of the supernatural, introduced for the first time in any Bond movie, were a bit unusual, but just as consistent as the science fiction in the previous Bond movies. Overall I would say this movie was an improvement over ""Diamonds Are Forever"", and certainly worth a bowl of popcorn.

765903,5,6304037279,"Roger Moore makes his debut in a rather unusual Bond film.  Live And Let Die, like Moonraker, was an attempt to cash in on what was hot at the time.  In this case it was blaxploitation flicks like Shaft and Dolemite.  Bond goes from Harlem to the big N.O. to the caribbean to track down a drug dealer and his henchmen.  Pretty cool henchmen if I do say so myself.  Baron Samedi has always been my favorite Bond villain.  Lots of cool 70s street slang and Bond is even referred to as a ""honkey"" a couple of times!  Good stuff.  I must say I do get a little pissed when people(most likely white folks) say this film is racist.  This arguement holds absolutely no water whatsoever.  Considering all the white villains Bond has been up against(not to mention Asian and Latino as well), putting him up against black villains in one lousy movie is racist all of a sudden?  Was Escape from New York racist coz the villain was Isaac Hayes?  Was Demolition Man a racist film coz Wesley Snipes was a brutal killer?  And don't forget that Darth Vader is black! I'm sure someone somewhere has overanalyzed that.  I hate to break it to ya, but there are indeed black drug dealers in the world.  Shocking, but true, so this film isn't really too farfetched.  I like the whole New Orleans/voodoo theme of this film.  Hell, I'm always a sucker for voodoo.  If a movie's got voodoo in it, it'll get at least two stars from me.  Roger Moore gives us his new interpretation of Bond, but it wouldn't be in full swing for another movie or two.  Moore's Bond films were always a bit cartoony and silly.  Just check out the villian's demise with a compressed air pellet for proof of this(this scene is hysterical).  Moore was practically nonstop with the one liners as well.  Some people whine about Moore, but I think he was great.  He certainly had big shoes to fill.  He's the most British of the Bonds.  He's got the look and the voice of a James Bond, no doubt about it.  If you ask me, in image and presentation, Moore is the definition of how Bond should be.  His weakness is that he looks like a pansy in fight and action scenes.  He certainly couldn't match Connery in the action department.  Live and Let Die is a must if you like a good action flick with just the right amount of cheese.",1132790400,7,2275,4.373205741626794
765904,4,6304037279,"As with my reviews for MOONRAKER and GOLDFINGER, I am a little biased toward giving this movie a higher review simply for the nostalgia that it was one of the ones the local TV stations ALWAYS seemed to be airing when I was growing up.

Well, if you are going in order, this is of course the film that introduces us to Roger Moore as James Bond.  Though he is not the first to replace Connery (George Lazenby did it first in the excellent ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE), he is the one to whom the torch truly passed, and he would occupy the role over the next 12 years, producing seven Bond pictures.  I'm not going to get into the battle of who is the best Bond - I'm simply going to say that, of all the actors, Moore is the least like Bond.  I like Moore and I like his movies - I just don't think they are really ""Bond"" movies the way Connery's and Dalton's were.  Moore brought much more humor to the role - and of course, he seemed much older, even in this debut film, which always brought a slightly ""dirty old man"" feel to his movies, especially the last two or three.

However, Moore didn't really bring his full character to the franchise until SPY WHO LOVED ME - in this outing, he seems to be keeping rather aloof from the role, as though he's putting his toe in the water (much the way Brosnan die with GOLDENEYE).  That's not to say it is a poor performance, just a little held back.

For Moore's debut, the producers picked Ian Fleming's second novel, and kept a very loose interpretation of it.  The major change is that Mr. Big has no ties to the Soviet Union nor to SMERSH as he did in the novel.  Here, he's just a drug runner.  This would be Bond's first time out after an individual enemy, rather than against a spy syndicate as was the case with the Connery films.  In fact, once the Connery era ended, so did the Spy vs. Spy plot of the films, only to return a handful of times down the road.  So there are two big changes ushered in with this, the 8th film in the series.

But let's move along - Bond is absent from the opening scene for the first time since FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE - instead, we get a few murders of agents to set up the tension, reminescent of DR. NO.  As the film progresses, Bond moves between New York and New Orleans (I think) trying to track down Mr. Big.  Along the way, he becomes infatuated with Ms. Solitaire, Big's mistress.  Jane Seymour fills the role as a young and attractive Bond girl who can actually act.

Other characters include the annoying Rosie Carver, a henchman who may in fact be an immortal Shaman, and another henchman with a metal claw for a hand.

The action is fairly sparse, but it leads to a lengthy and very well executed boat chase down a back-water Louisiana bayou.  For all the gadgetry and explosions of some of the later boat chases, this one is still one of my favorites because of simple pace, editing, and those great shots of Bond jumping the roads from one pond do the next!  LOVE THIS SEQUENCE!

Other action includes a fairly exciting chase on a Double Decker bus, a less-than-impressive car chase on a small airbase, and the usual shoot-out ending, this time in some VooDoo cult encampment.

Like I said, the film moves pretty slow overall, and it isn't always clear why Bond is involved with some simple drug-smuggling case, especially since they removed the SMERSH connection that made the book much more sensible - but it's still a cool movie if only for just giving Moore a chance to explore the character.

Like I said, I give it three stars for what it is, and a fourth star for simple child-hood nostalgia!

(Finally, in response to the previous review charging this movie with being racist - I just think it is interesting that in twenty other movies, Bond has toppled 20 other white villains and their white syndicates.  Now there is this ONE black villain with his black syndicate (1 out of 20, mind you) and suddenly it is racism?!  Well . . . anyway . . . I'll let you draw your own conclusions from there.)",1127779200,5,4008,4.34496644295302
765905,4,6304037279,"Let me start by saying this was my first Bond film I got to see in the movie house back in '73, so I'm somewhat partial to it. I think the basic issue that nags the viewer is that this is primarily takes an 'establishment' character and puts him into a 'non-establishment' movie; hence, all the easy and reliable devices (leading naval forces, briefcases, Q, lots of pretty women, etc..)and charm used by Connery (if he had played Bond in this outing) would undeniably have fallen flat; even the cliff-hanger type scenes seem to have little energy.  It's almost like the director takes some good black actors, gives them screen time, has them do some mean things, and that somehows supposed to equate to a classic Bond-type villain.  Ho hum.

It's definitely not a proper nor safe vehicle for a James Bond film, so I feel sorry for Moore, with this as his first big screen performance spy performance AND taking over for the great Sean Connery, no less.  Still, he makes the best of it admirably and thus moves on to make some super '70s/early '80s flicks (For Your Eyes Only being a personal favorite).",1125532800,,1103,4.612244897959184
765906,4,6304037279,"This is not Roger Moore's best film, but it's certainly not the worst. The boat chase is great, and his escape from a crocodile farm is another highlight. Even though it took another film for Moore to fine tune his performance, this is still an good debut.",1123459200,,256,4.468085106382978
765907,4,6304037279,"Roger Moore debuted as Bond in this early 70's flick in which the threat is not some shadowy megalomaniac, but insidious organized crime. Investigating the mysterious deaths of British agents in New York, New Orleans and the Caribbean island of San Monique, Bond uncovers a multi-national crime cartel using ready to flood the western world with heroin. Following the trail from Manhattan to New Orleans by way of the Caribbean, Bond finds the cartel headed by a shadowy ""Mr. Big"" and allied with San Monique's president (Yaphett Koto). With a tarot-dealing seer (Jane Seymour) ready to deal the death card for Mr. Big's enemies and the legendary Baron Samedi (Geoffrey Holder, the 7-up guy) as a mascot, Mr. Big's cartel pushes fear of the spirit realm with a healthy dose of heroin.

This was Moore's first stint as 007, and the change marks a new direction only hinted in ""Diamonds are Forever"" - with car chases, visual sight gags and elaborate stunts. The broad humor seemed a good idea at the time (LaLD was followed up by ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" which not only expanded on the comedy but even unwisely returned the comic-relief: Clifton James as Sheriff Pepper). The real joke is the flavor which is early 1970's blaxploitation, Harlem, afros, soul food and Bond about as out of place as a Ku Klux Klan cookout at the Apollo Theater (a variation on the line uttered by one of the characters in this film - I couldn't make that up!). Watching the film you keep thinking that the producers had dreamt up the whole thing after a night of one-too-many Vodka Martinis. Even when you find out what the story is about, you're not sure you should care (there's no clicking clock to a nuclear explosion or WWIII). The script manages to neglect that important scene when Bond stumbles upon the evil operation and we realize the gravity of the evil plot (like the nerve gas scene in ""Moonraker"" or the Ft. Knox diorama from ""Goldfinger""). Nevertheless, LaLD excels on Moore's talent for self-deprecation (the joke is that he's always in the last place he belongs, and doesn't seem to care - like when he bravely tails Mr. Big's operatives uptown - into Harlem) and also on the George Martin score. Yaphet Kotto is also good as Katanga, the Carribean president with his own angle on Mr. Big. Be aware though - if you watch the film waiting for Bond to strut around Manhattan to the theme to ""Shaft"", you're in a for a disappointment.",1118102400,3,2434,4.686915887850467
765908,4,6304037279,"In 1973 Roger Moore made a smooth transition from his most famous role - that of Simon Templar - to yet another literary character who had been made famous by another actor. Whereas the Saint had been immortalized by George Sanders in a series of movies much earlier (allowing Moore to make it his own in the highly successful television series), the memory of Sean Connery as James Bond was much more recent in the publics mind so Moore had his work cut out for him.
It is hardly surprising then that ""Live and Let Die"" plays it relatively safe. Moore went on record as saying that he read one line detailing how Bond had to kill once, but didn't very much like it (from the novel ""Goldfinger""), and took his portrayal from that. In fact in his first couple of movies Moore plays the character much closer to his television Simon Templar persona than later in the series (the producers subsequently  felt it was too close to Connery's interpretation of the role). This is a sad development as Moore never really had the chance to show he could play both charming and ruthless as he had plenty of chances to portray on The Saint.
Taking one of Fleming's most controversial novels (the villains are all black) the producers were faced with a vexing problem. They overcame this by not only giving Bond a black ally, but also allowing the villains to get the better of 007 on several occasions. They also threw in a redneck sheriff as comic relief for good measure.
The movie is essentially one long chase and in a definite break with tradition we are offered up a pretitles sequence in which James Bond does not appear. In the opening we see two British agents killed by ingenious means - first a man is killed at the United Nations through use of what can only be assumed a sound weapon and a second by snakebite on the Caribbean island of San Monique. James Bond (in only the second and last time we see a glimpse of his London apartment) is assigned by M to investigate.
What follows is a chase as Bond pursues the Prime Minister of San Monique  Dr. Kananga and an underworld gang leader named Mr. Big across the United States to a fiery, explosive (literally) climax in the Caribbean. On the way our interepid hero must escape from all manner of tricky situations, such as being stranded on a tiny island surrounded by crocodiles. The action highlight is most probably a boat chase half way through the movie that has probably only been bested by an even better boat chase sequence in ""Puppet on a Chain.""
This movie does seem to have trouble deciding if it wants to be humorous or serious and I liked the introduction of the voodoo element that makes this a very unique 007 picture.
Truth be told, the initial Bond movie by Roger Moore is a mixed bag in my book. Whereas the supporting villains are excellent, the main villain is underwhelming and his plot (flooding the US with drugs) is rather ho-hum compared to bigger plots like destruction of the world (Moonraker) or the nuclear attack of British cities (For Your Eyes Only).
Roger Moore is also still finding his way in the part and apart from a few glimmers of what he would eventually deliver, the movie and his performance seems to be on remote control.
The DVD is one of the refurbished releases of late 1999. Previously the Bond movies had been released by MGM in the accursed snapper cases with few special features. MGM corrected this oversight throughout 1999 and 2000 releasing special editions of the movies in a series of three waves.
""Live and Let Die"" was one of the seven movies released in the Oct. 19, 1999 wave (the first). For this reason its format is slightly different from releases in subsequent releases with this one serving up two audio commentaries and one documentary on the making of the movie.
It is in the commentaries were the real joy of this DVD lies. We are treated to a scene specific commentary from writer Tom Manckiewicz. The fact that he is sitting in the studio watching the movie with us is very obvious - he even noticeably yawns during the opening credits (hold in there Tom there's another couple of hours to go). His commentary is informative and very enjoyable. There is also a commentary by Guy Hamilton which is also entertaining. Aside from this the special features are very recognizable to collectors of these DVDs with trailers and tv spots and a still gallery with over 150 images. There is of course the requisite ""Making of"" documentary and a very short ""On the set with Roger Moore"" featurette that will prove interesting to Bond fans. Perhaps most curious of all is a UK Milk Board commercial that was released to tie in with the new James Bond movie. One special feature also here (and one I really miss on MGM releases these days) is a very handsome collectible booklet with trivia and notes on the production.
UPDATE- It should be noted that there is a rerelease of this movie coming up on DVD which will feature a newly recorded scene specific audio commentary by Bond actor Roger Moore. So, it may well be worth holding off on a purchase until these Ultimate Editions are released towards the end of 2006.",1115856000,35,5127,4.583877995642702

I would go on to discover the Sean Connery films and become a 007 fanatic to this day.  LIVE AND LET DIE would drop further down the list of my favorites, but it's still a good one.  Definitely one of the best of Moore's.  The boat chase through the Louisiana bayous is still exciting.  Some people complain about the loud-mouth Sheriff, but I thought he was funny (his appearance in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN was a bit much though, even though he added some life to that entry).

I loved the cast.  Yaphet Kotto is always great.  Jane Seymour, at 19 in her debut, is stunning.  Geoffrey Holder, whose smooth, deep voice is still heard on radio stations to this day, makes a interesting presence as the ghostly voodoo figure, Baron Samedi.  And Julius W. Harris is cool as the ""butter-hook"" thug, TeeHee.

The title song, by Paul & Linda McCartney, is usually considered one of the best.

But be sure to check out the extras, especially the Making Of featurette.

Let's just say that it did not fit up to all of my expectations then and now as a Bond Veteran owning all 20 movies it seems even worse. Don't get me wrong I think this is a good movie and a welcome part to any Bond collection, I just don't really like Moore in any of the Bond films.

This movie had the very difficult task of replacing Connery yet again in this famous series. And instead of finding a man to play Bond as a tough suave hero they put in the somtimes painfully corny Roger Moore. Sadly they could not have chosen a worse book to base it on becuase they set him off right away at destroying the second best book in the series.

Lets move past Moore shall we. The rest of the movie was great, with awesome gadgets, one of the best women in all of the Bond films Solitare, and a very fun villian. This also brought back Felix Lieter, Bond's friend in the CIA who appeares in many of the movies. The man who played Felix this time is the only one who ever plays him a second time in the movie License to Kill.

765941,3,6304037279,"Roger Moore appears for the first time as the dashing British secret agent in this 1973 production.  Moore performs quite well as Bond and the screenplay is well directed by the talents of Guy Hamilton.  The missing element in this film is simply a worthy plot for someone on the scale of Bond.

In this film, Bond goes to America and the Carribean to investigate the dealings of a drug lord (Yaphet Kotto)who disposes of snoopy agents with the help of a Voodoo priest.  The villain also relies on the celestial advice of his captive soothsayer Solitaire (Jane Seymour.)  In time, Bond obtains the help of Solitaire to expose the drug ring and save the day.

The weakest part of this film is the plot.  As with 'License To Kill' with Timothy Dalton, Bond chasing around measely drug dealers isn't really worthy of his work compared to saving the world from arch-villains and their organizations such as Blofeld and SPECTER, or Drax and his space industry.  The story therefore fizzles out and the audience is drawn more into the wild chases and the humorous quips.  Not a terribly memorable Bond but still far superior to the Dalton or Lazenby films.",1091577600,,1150,4.71
765942,2,6304037279,"While the earliest Bond adventures were ground-breaking and highly influential, the later films were more reflective of the other popular trends of the moment.  Perhaps the greatest example of this phenomena is Live and Let Die.  At the time, blaxploitation films were immensely popular and this film obviously incorporates elements of the genre.  Case in point, Mr. Big captures Bond and informs him that ""names is for tombstones"" and then instructs his lackeys to ""take the honkey out back and waste him.""  There are many other stereotypical letdowns throughout the picture.  And not just featuring African Americans, as Clifton James takes a turn as a redneck sheriff that will probably make anyone from Louisiana cringe.  We also get an underwhelming score by George Martin to accompany the awesome title song by McCartney.  However, Live and Let Die was also groundbreaking.  Bond had an interracial love affair, which was still racy stuff back then (no pun intended).  All of this gives the film a unique (some would say weird) feel amongst the many Bond pictures.

Is it a good movie?  Not really.  The biggest problem is pacing.  Bond hops from one locale to the next mixing it up with assorted bad guys, but never really advancing the story, which is rendered nearly incoherent.  While the action pieces are fun, the viewer is left wondering when the actual plot will move along (which it only begins to do in the final 20 minutes).  That being said, the movie isn't the disaster Diamonds Are Forever was.  So, if you are curious or a die hard Bond fan, watching Live and Let Die is a cool enough way to spend an afternoon.

Unfortunately, MGM didn't care to spend any time on the sound mix for this movie.  We get mono.  Considering films as old as Thunderball have 5.1 mixes, this is pretty disappointing.  The extra features are great, as they are on all the Bond discs.",1090800000,2,1882,4.785714285714286

Not only was there a new Bond, but after scoring six consecutive films, John Barry abandoned ship, or was thrown overboard, in favor of Beatles producer George Martin whose forgettable score consisted of little more than instumental reworkings of Paul McCartney's dynamic, if non-sensical, title song. But elsewhere  there were some distant memories of the first Bond film, ""Dr. No,"" due to the presence of a Quarrel Jr., the son of Bond's ally from a decade earlier.
""Live and Let Die"" was daring in its day for casting black actor Yaphet Kotto as the chief villain, a politically incorrect move for any film at the time other than those in the genre known as ""black exploitation."" As for the Bondgirl, Jane Seymour is one of the best, not only beautiful but a good actress to boot. Moore is quite good as 007, but in bearing no resemblance to the larger than life figure cut by Sean Connery, often makes one think this is a big-screen version of ""The Saint.""
What sinks the film is the comedy. There's too much of it, and most of it belongs in another movie. Clifton James's backward sheriff impressed somebody because he returned in ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" but his appearance helps to undermine the movie. As for the action, it's fairly standard stuff with the highlight being a boat chase that, like Bond himself, goes on and on and on.

766001,4,6304037279,"Roger Moore's debut as Bond, in terms of quality, is a so-so outing, as was expected.  Moore brings about an aura distinct with that of Connery's.  The Bond that Connery portrayed was more of the consummate professional type, serious, rather impatient, edgy, relying more on toughness and innate resourcefulness to see him through.  On the other hand, Roger Moore concentrates on the finesse side of Bond.  He is debonaire, more intuitive, more blueblooded in the sense he is articulated and sophisticated, and a definite poster child on what it is to be a British gentleman secret agent.  Moore reflects the 70's, where poise and style rules and therefore more adequate than Connery to play Bond in this point of time.  Live and Let Die lays the foundation of this revolutionized Bond attitude the next six films, with Moore at the helm.
Although Live and Let Die wasn't quite anything truly special in terms of overall story quality, besides Paul McCartney & the Wings' eerie, but memorable theme song, this film has to be one of, or if not Moore's most provocative and intriguing under his tenure as 007.  First off, the mood and the pace of this particular episode has changed.  Aside from the fact that the 70's feel prevails throughout, there is a supernatural, superstitious sense, a very foreign concept to the Bond series, even to this very day.  There is a sense of mystery and unsettled emotion in Live and Let Die right from the get-go.  Bond must investigate the enigmatic murders of three of his fellow agents: Dawes on the floor of the United Nations, Hamilton on a New Orleans street right in front of a funeral procession, and Baines who became part of a bizarre voodoo ritual on the island of San Monique.  Getting a lead, 007 is on the trail for a Dr. Kananga, a UN representative of San Monique who ""witnessed"" Dawes' murder, while a Harlem kingpin Mr. Big (Kananga's other personality) gets in Bond's way.  Bond also encounters an intriguing tarot reader, Solitaire (a very young Jane Seymour) who aids Kananga in foretelling the future.  Bond is calm, cool and collected, amidst intimidation, inspired by the spiritual and supernatural circulating the movie and obviously, by Mr. Big's African-American organized crime machine.  Successful in dispatching Solitaire's fears of the superunknown, Bond embarks on a mission to foil Kananga's plot to smuggle and distribute free heroin in an attempt to control the heroin market.
The most controversial aspect of Live and Let Die is obviously its stereotypical subject.  Filmed during touchy times, naturally African-Americans are portrayed as the big, bad, baneful dirty criminals, selling or in this case, giving away heroin for gain.  At the same time, blacks obtain somewhat of an irrational label, portraying voodoo as just that, an irrational, outdated religion.  The relative uneasiness of race relations is focused on as well (i.e. Bond/Rosie's love scene, the ""Billy Bob"" segment) Whites aren't exactly exempt from exploitation either.  J.W. Pepper, played by Clifton James, is the stubborn, tobacco-spitting, indifferent redneck Louisiana sheriff, in essence, mocking southern culture.  And of course, Bond, the seemingly omniscient, refined white man conquers all.
Other than the relevant shortcomings, Live and Let Die is an action-packed extravaganza, meant to be taken with a good sense of humor.  Moore elicits more of an over-the-top, lighthearted element to the film.  Seymour's peformance as Solitaire is a definite bright-spot, as she plays out the innocent, vulnerable side of her character well.  Yaphet Kotto's Kananga/Mr. Big is a competent villain who is seen off, Monty Python style and arguably is given the unenviable association with the worst death of a head villain in the Bond series.  The supporting cast, in particular, Rosie Carver, Baron Samedi, and J.W. Pepper add a smart, eerie, and hilarious touch, respectively.  And of course, the action scenes make up for its blatant flaws.  A stellar speedboat chase, highlighted by Bond's crocodile-crossing stunt getaway before the chase even starts the chase, takes the cake, as the best sequence of the movie.  All in all, a high-octane Bond adventure caper with an odd, but enticing supernatural kick.",1054425600,12,4250,5.149927219796216
766002,4,6304037279,"This James Bond movie was a movie of multiple firsts.  The first James Bond movie with a real rock song as the theme (""Live and Let Die"" by Paul McCartney and Wings); it was the first major role for beautiful Jane Seymour; it was the first Bond movie where he was after someone other than someone out to take over the world; and of course it was the first Bond movie with Roger Moore in the title role.
Some of the firsts worked really well.  Jane Seymour is always lovely, and in this movie she was in her early 20s, looking absolutely stunning in a variety of costumes.  The song by Wings is one of their most memorable and well-known.  The other firsts had varying levels of success.
Roger Moore rolled James Bond back from the continuous one-liners doled out by Sean Connery in ""Diamonds Are Forever"", which was welcomed and at least temporarily prevented James Bond movies from becoming spy comedies.  This Bond movie also temporarily abandoned the science fiction theme of the last couple of Bond movies under Sean Connery.  However, as good a bad guy as Yaphet Kotto played, ultimately he was still a drug dealer and seemed barely a worthy adversary for Bond.
The other semi-welcomed change is the increased action of this movie.  While the movie is advertised as being non-stop action, which it is, I wonder whether too much action is possible.  Sean Connery's Bond generally had a well developed story to back him up, with ever-increasing plot complexity.  It seems that much of the intellectual complexity was thrown out in this movie for the sake of continuous car and boat chases.  Yet with all that, this movie is still a good Bond movie.  Not the best, but not the worst either.  The boat chase through Louisiana is exciting with at several novel crashes.
One thing I didn't mention earlier is that this movie turned out to be an excellent vehicle for a number of Black actors.  In addition to Yaphet Kotto, Geoffrey Holder and Julius Harris played very memorable supporting roles.  Gloria Hendry as Rosie Carver is also a very memorable Black actor, as she was the first Black Bond girl; Bond's kiss must have seemed somewhat shocking to audiences of 1973, not to mention when he made love to her.  The one flaw in all this is that Blacks seemed to have gotten all the criminal roles, and very few of the law enforcement roles (only one that I can recall).  While having equal opportunity as criminals, people of color should have been more dispersed on both side of the line.
With all its flaws, this movie still turns out to be a decent entry in Bond filmography.  Roger Moore brings the styling of ""The Saint"" to James Bond, which was certainly a change for Bond.  Furthermore, the opportunity was taken to bring Bond somewhat back to earth.  Admittedly the elements of the supernatural, introduced for the first time in any Bond movie, were a bit unusual, but just as consistent as the science fiction in the previous Bond movies.  Overall I would say this movie was an improvement over ""Diamonds Are Forever"", and certainly worth a bowl of popcorn.",1046649600,2,3068,4.66728624535316
766003,3,6304037279,"Ian Fleming wrote the original novel of ""Live and Let Die""--the second James Bond adventure--in the mid-50s. 2 decades later, the producers of the Bond movies turned it into a movie. The book is better of course.
  By the early '70s the Bond films were in a quandary. Connery had left for good, and when the series attempted to create a well-crafted film that captured the letter and spirit of Fleming's works (""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" the finest 007 flick) its box office returns convinced them to crank out self-parodies instead. And if any man was suited to poke fun at himself and walk through an entire movie  tongue in his cheek, it was surely Roger Moore.
 This is Moore's first outing as 007, and the producers attempted to differentiate this Bond film from the rest. Gone are the tuxedos, Vodka martinis or cigarettes. Gone are Ken Adams' huge, magnificent sets. Gone is John Barry's luxurious, rousing music. Gone is Peter Hunt's whip-smart editing. Most importantly, gone is the input of Richard Maibaum, the scriptwriter who had a hand in all the best Bond films (Name your favorite--he wrote it.)Instead the script was written by an American, Tom Manckiewicz, who'd helped out on the previous Bond, ""Diamonds are Forever,"" the worst Connery film. The cartoonish, larger-than-life approach of DAF was carried through to ""Live and Let Die."" Instead of a clever, flamboyant thriller, we got a confused and drab action flick.
Guy Hamilton, who'd directed ""Goldfinger,"" was brought back on board, presumably as a good luck charm. No dice. His direction is slow-wittedly uninspired and so is the art direction and cinematography. As for the screenplay, it has no forward momentum or suspense, and the villain's grand scheme--some muddled hokum about a heroin giveaway--is rather ho-hum and forgettable. It's a weak fumble of a story with very little excitement in it. So, the film's sets, photography and story all lack the epic, lavish feel you've come to expect from the Bond series. This is a low-budget Bond and it shows.
What's even more embarrassing are the racial attitudes at the heart of the film. It's basically about Bond rescuing a pretty white girl from conspiratorial hordes of all-black villains who either talk jive or perform voodoo ceremonies.
Some of the blame for this should go to Ian Fleming, whose novel bore a patronizing attitude toward race issues, especially regarding voodoo and a supposed Communist influence on African Americans. But Fleming ultimately respected African Americans far more than the film makers, who've filled their film up with cartoonish blaxpoiltation types. Fleming's ultimate message was that blacks had just as much intelligence and ability as anybody else, so the emergence of black supercriminals and enormous crime schemes were not only expected, but a sign of progress. But the film luridly exploits its black characters (all but one of whom are villains).
Those villains are up against the whitest-bread Bond you can imagine. The sight of Roger Moore stiffly strolling into a Harlem bar and trying not to raise his mock-aristocratic eyebrows is one of the weirdest images in the Bond series. Despite his lack of in-depth acting skills, his meager physical abilities, and his reluctance to act anything like a government assassin, it's impossible to really dislike Roger Moore. He doesn't have any pretenses about himself. He's got the charm of self-assurance, though in LALD he's still feeling his way into the role.
""Live and Let Die"" has several elements worth the price of a rental. First is George Martin's score, the first Bond soundtrack not written by John Barry. It's got a harder edge than Barry's work, and incorporates funk/soul elements that never again found their way into Bond music. It's very pleasantly dated, and the guitars and horns have a definite early '70s feel.
Second is the title sequence, created by the amazing Maurice Binder. Designed to accompany Paul McCartney's weird, rousing title song, it's a surreal little tone poem. Utilizing such commonplace items as matches and sparklers, Binder created a compelling, ominous minifilm that captures the vibe and thrill of voodoo far better than anything in the actual film. The moment when McCartney sings ""Live and let . . . DIE!"" a close-up of a woman's dark face turns into a flaming skull--it's a wonderful moment.
Finally, ""Live and Let Die"" is the one Bond film that flirts with the idea of the supernatural. These are in fact the most interesting, surreal moments in the film. LALD might have been one of the truly interesting Bond films if such touches were expanded upon to give the entire film a surreal atmosphere of the bizarre. The prevalence of skulls and dart-shooting scarecrows, the continual shots of tarot cards and of Solitaire predicting the future with them (her powers seems genuine), along with images like an effigy of Baron Samedi rolling his eyes to look at the immense chunk Bond's just shot off of his head, or the Baron's triumphant appearance in the final shot, all seem to playfully suggest that the world of the supernatural may actually exist. But the actual film lets this fascinating aspect down with its tired direction and otherwise dull, down-to-earth screenplay. ""Live and Let Die"" might have been truly memorable if it had combined a compelling epic plot, with the usual suave Bondian antics and a surreal atmosphere wittily suggestive of the supernatural power of voodoo rather than exploitive of it. As it is, it's a mediocre film with memorable moments.",1041033600,3,5545,5.043620501635769

In many ways it does not even seem like it is part of the series. The character of James Bond was totally revamped in LIVE AND LET DIE. Bond seems to have traded in his cigarettes for cheroots. Gone are the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" the Dom Perigone, Bond's virility, worldliness and sardonic wit. It's all gone. Even his wardrobe is over-the-top. But it is all a facade. Bond's appearance as a fop and dandy are only a ruse, a deception. If you examine this film you will see that Bond is no perfunctory agent. He dispenses lethal doses of vengeful comeuppance with his urbane charm. The film's lighter approach under Guy Hamilton's direction actually makes many of the scenes of violent and contorted death more palatable.

The crocodile scene is worth the admission money alone, and lest we forget, the film contains what must be the best two lines ever uttered by Bond...first, when he is trussed up with Jane Seymour above the Shark tank, and has his arm cut to attract said shark: ""Couldnt we try something on a simpler vain??"" and then at the climax in the train, after taking care of the one armed villain, he tells Solitare(Seymour) ""Im just being disarming dear!""

They must have been sweating bullets when they handed this film to United Artists for distribution - it's that bad and plenty Moore.
Several misteps take place early in the film.  For example, Q drops by Bonds house to give him an assignement. I don't know about any of my readers out there, but to me it's taboo to show Bond's house.  It takes so much mystery away from the character.  In my opinion, Bond shows up for violence and sex -- he doesn't serve expressos to his boss.
Finally, the depiction of black mobsters in this film is clearly from the UK perspective.  At one point, ""Bond"" offers a cabby a $20 tip if he takes him into Harlem. The black cabbie says ""I would take you to a Klu Klux Klan meeting for that.""

The music, far better than any other bond movie music, defines the tension 100% and the voodoo plot, which could easily have been silly, is handled sensibly and is extremely dark, where both Bond and the audience know nothing.  Moore is superb, probably in his best performance before he got too old, and the villain, very humanly played by Yaphet Kotto, is not with silly frailties like in the exceptional novel (he suffered from accidie, greying skin and his head was enormous, amongst other things).  Admittedly silly characters like the irritating JW Pepper and Rosie Carver ruin some of the tension, but this hardly matters looking at the big picture. Moore's hilariously bad one-liners and generally likeable and squeaky-clean persona is the perfect contrast to the voodoo world. The only real problem with this movie is the boat chase scene- with half this length and no Sherriff Pepper it would only just be passable, but it doesn't stop the audience (or at least me) wondering what is really going on, and wanting more, Roger Moore. A pity he followed up with The Man With the Golden Gun, a frankly laughable effort.",986774400,,1227,4.838095238095238

Pepper after James Bond has distroyed every police car in his county as well as created chaos on the river that runs through it.  The question remains unanswered although the response should have been a most definite ""yes"".  For this is the most destructive of the Bond series, probably to hide the lack of plot and characterization.
Made in 1973 it went to almost desperate lengths to distance Roger Moore's interpratation of Ian Fleming's superhero from that of Sean Connery, who had departed after ""Diamonds Are Forever"" (1971).  The glitzy Las Vagas locations of the latter film are replaced by semi derilect Harlem; the smooth (and somewhat camp) Charles Grey by the altogether rougher persona of Yaphet Kotto and the white Tuxedos by business suits.  Incredibly one review I read when it came out commented favourably on how modern and trendy Moore's suits were when compared with the ones Sean Connery sported in ""From Russia With Love"" (1963).  Now after all these years Sean appears like the epitemy of Savel Row class whereas Roger's attire resembles something out of a thrift shop.
The music is also different with Paul & Linda McCartney's rip roaring theme, not to memtion it's famously clumsy grammar (""In this ever changing world in which we live in""), and George Martin's score having graduated from imitation Bond music in ""Help"" to the real thing here. It is the best of the non John Barry scores and compliments the action very well.
It is in many respects a remake of ""Dr. No"", as Bond is initally sent off in the dead of night to investigate the disapearance of some agents and stumbles upon something more sinister - namely heroin production - and then destroys everything in sight. I don't believe that it is possible to grow heroin poppies in tropical climates but perhaps Blofeld geneticaly modified some for Mr. Big in his lab in Switzerland while he was in between takes in OHMSS.
The action tends to dominate what little plot there is but it is well handled by veteran bond director Guy Hamilton (although I noticed in his commentary that there were vast chunks of the film during which he has nothing to say about his creation). However, much of the drama simply doesn't work; for instance when Mr. Big peels off his rubber mask to reveal he is in fact Dr. Kananger no one, not even Bond, is suprised.
One thing that people tend to comment upon is the absence of ""Q"". Actor Desmond Llewellyn was, at the time of production, staring in the TV adaptation of Monica Dickens' ""Follyfoot"" books and thus was not available for ""Live And Let Die"". I hope that clears it up. In any case there were very few gadgets for him to explain, with the exception of the ridiculous Rolex with it's ""magnetic beam"".
Although the film has many faults - and I've only had time to highlight some of them - it is still fun to watch and has always worked better on television than in the cinema.  The print is excellent and the extras on this DVD make it an essential part of any Bond fan's collection.

766100,4,6304037279,"As mentioned in the included documentary (DVD version), the Bond conglomerate revamped much of the then-moribund formula that served, then smothered, Sean Connery. DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER screenwriter is back, as is Bond veteran Guy Hamilton (GOLDFINGER, DIAMONDS), and production designer Ken Adam. Much of the bombast of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER were abandoned (too bad they returned after MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN).
What I remembered loving in 1973, and still do, about LIVE AND LET DIE was the very fresh approach to the story, and Bond. Moore, acting hard to NOT duplicate his Saint persona, plays Bond in a very different vein. The production design was hipper. The milieu and script was forceably hipper (to the point of clunking terribly in parts). And George Martin's blaxploitation-infused score left no mistake that this was a NEW Bond for the 1970. I still like the music, particularly the coup of having Paul McCartney score the punchy title song. The addition of a pure comic element, Clifton James' Sheriff J.W. Pepper, was as fun as it was unexpected.
Does it measure up? There are two camps: those that like the early, classic years, and the later campy, send-up years. I'm in the former. LIVE AND LET DIE was a nice anomaly, bridging the character driven suspense (Bond and Solitaire, Solitaire and Kananga) and growing expectation for outlandish stunts. Like FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and ON HER MAJESTYS SECRET SERVICE, this film skirted some of the obvious cliches and made unexpected choices. Many of the trademark ""Bond touches"" that Terence Young introduced were omitted because they were strongly associated with Connery. The result? A pared down Bond character that I find more in keeping with the books.

766103,3,6304037279,"""Live and Let Die"", released in 1973, is the eighth entry in the James Bond series produced by Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. It is also the debut of Roger Moore as the British secret agent, a role he would play  of total of seven times, more that any other actor.
Sean Connery was  originally slated to reprise his starring role but no amount of money could  tempt him to sign on. The producers turned to an actor they had originally  wanted to play Bond back in 1962, Roger Moore. At that time, Moore had to  turn down the role because he was committed to play Simon Templar in the  successful television series ""The Saint"". But by time ""Live  and Let Die"" was ready to go into production, Moore was available to  take on the role. Guy Hamilton did return to direct his third Bond film and  ""Live and Let Die"" does have a feel similar to ""Diamonds are  Forever"". Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell reprised their roles as  ""M"" and Miss Moneypenny but Desmond Llewelyn is notable for his  absence, the only time ""Q"" has not appeared in a Bond film. Also  missing, this time permanently, is the evil organization SPECTRE and its  leader Blofeld. Except for one uncredited cameo, Blofeld never again  appears in a Bond film.
In this outing, James Bond is investigating a  series of murders targeting British intelligence. The one common thread  appears to be the prime minister of the island nation of San Monique,  Doctor Kananga, who is currently residing at his consulate in New York  City. The CIA already has a team led by Bond's opposite number Felix Leiter  keeping tabs on Kananga. Bond follows Kananga to Harlem where he meets  another ruthless character named ""Mr Big"", the boss of bosses in  the black underworld. Bond also meets a mysterious young woman named  Solitaire who seems to be able to predict the future by using tarot cards.  Somehow, these two men are connected to each other and Bond must go to San  Monique where he must penetrate a world of voodoo and discover the secret  which has killed all others who tried.
""Live and Let Die"" was  shot on location in New York City, Jamaica and around New Orleans. It was  the first Bond film (and the last) where African-American actors played  many of the prominent roles. Yaphet Kotto plays Doctor Kananga with the  sauve, menacing manner usually associated with Bond (some have called  Kananga, rather than the assasin Scaramanga the anti-Bond). Solitaire is  played by Jane Seymour, who portrays her in a detached, wistful manner.  Bond participates in his first interracial love scene with the lovely CIA  agent Rosie Carver(played by Gloria Hendry). Kananga's henchman TeeHee is  well played by Julius W. Harris and Clifton James provides the comedy  relief by playing Sheriff J. W. Pepper up as the reddest redneck one could  ever hope to meet. Finally, Felix Leiter is played by his fifth different  actor, David Hedison, who would later become the only actor to play the CIA  agent twice.
Despite all the promising elements, ""Live and Let  Die"" comes off as a pale shadow of Bond films past. Unlike his  excellent portrayal of the Saint, whose character was similar to that of  Bond, Roger Moore comes off as very stiff and formal, earning him the  nickname as the ""wooden Bond"". However, the dry wit that is  characteristic of the Moore Bond is much in evidence in this film. The  female characters seemed to have regress from the strong minded women in  the earlier Bonds. Even CIA agent Rosie Carver is played as hopelessly  inept. Another problem is the growing tendency to play James Bond up for  laughs, continuing a trend started in ""Diamonds Are Forever"".  James Bond and his world are becoming a caricature of its sixties self.  That kind of formula works better with Bond facing a major foe rather than  a small time one. It is ironic that the story of ""Live and Let  Die"" might have worked might have worked better if it had been made in  the 1960's. In 1973, James Bond almost seems wasted here since the  moviegoing public expects him to save the world or at least some of part of  it.
If the sum is less than satifactory, ""Live and Let Die""  certainly has some good parts. The action scenes are first rate,  particularly the boat chase and the plane chase. The fight scene on the  train between Bond and TeeHee is reminiscent of the one from ""From  Russia With Love"". Geoffrey Holder's portrayal of Baron Samedi is  downright eerie, it is a shame that this fasinating character could not  have had a more prominent role in the script. Perhaps the best element of  all was the lack of references to earlier Bond adventures in order to  establish Roger Moore as the new Bond. Moore is Bond, period.
Despite it  all, ""Live and Let Die"" did well enough at the box office to  permanently associate Roger Moore with Bond. Moore would in time make some  of the best Bond movies of all time.
The special edition DVD contains  the best print and sound track of ""Live and Let Die"" this  reviewer has seen. The movie is shown in the widescreen format although it  was not shot with the very wide Panavision camera like many earlier Bond  films. Typical of the special editions, there are two audio commentary  tracks and the documentary material as well as trailers, advertisements,  and still photos. If one was just starting out their Bond collection, one  might start with ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", ""For Your Eyes  Only"" or ""Octopussy"" to see Roger Moore at his best.

Equally memorable is the speed boat chase through the  Louisiana bayous, which holds up well even to this day.  The rest however,  doesn't merit much praise.

And Moore is quite a let down after Sean Connery (unargueably the best Bond, by the way).  Bond is sent to the  deep south of the U.S. after drug dealers.  The only good part about this  whole escapade is the black guy with only one arm, he's pretty cool.  Anyway, when they put him in those crocodile infested waters and tried to  drown him, I was going for the bad guys, really.  After what seemed like 10  hours of nothing but Roger Moore's ""Bond"" I was sick of it,  totally.  The only good thing about this movie is the theme song, which is  pretty cool.  Come to tink of it, the theme songs are the only good things  that have ever come out of the 7 Bond films Roger Moore did, quite  interesting. No wait, I take that back, Mayday in A View to Kill was cool.",959472000,5,872,4.06508875739645
766107,4,6304037279,"After Sean Connery left the role of OO7 UA chose Roger Moore to take the role of Bond and his debut is fairly impressive, yet it can't compare to Conery's debut in Dr. No at all. Roger Moore is good but wouldn't actually  grow completely  into the role until 1977's The Spy who Loved Me. Yaphet  Kotto is a good villain as island diplomat Kananga  aka Mr. Big. Julius  Harris and Geoffrey Holder are great and very memorable as steel-armed  Tee-Hee and voodoo man Baron Samedi. The plot is that Kananga will release  tons of heroin worth millions of dollars into the streets sold through a  chain of Fillet of Soul restaurants to greatly increase the number of  users. Bond must travel back and fourth from the San Monique to New  Orleans. As in Dr. No, the Caribbean settings are very beautiful. Paul  McCartney and Wings perform one of the best OO7 songs ever and George  Martin's score is great. The action includes a car chase through the  countryside roads of San Monique, a gunfight in a plane garage, a terrific  boat chase (my personal favorite in the series) through the rivers of  southern Louisiana, and hand-to-hand fghts around a shark train and on a  train where OO7 defeats Kananga and Tee-Hee. Jane Seymour is great as  Solitaire.",958176000,4,1246,4.6422018348623855
766108,3,6304037279,"If, like me, you were always kind of baffled how Roger Moore managaed to retain the role of James Bond after such a dismal first picture, this Special Edition DVD will likely go a long way towards enlightenment.  The  number of additional features is impressive, and you will likely need them  all to untangle the, let's face it, racist mess that is _Live and Let Die_.  It tells you where the producers were trying to go with all the  African-American stereotyping and gives you a better appreciation for the  time in which the film was shot.  Also, there's much discussion given to  the Louisiana boat chase sequence, which still, I believe, holds the  Guinness Record for the longest boat jump.",953683200,,697,4.741666666666666
