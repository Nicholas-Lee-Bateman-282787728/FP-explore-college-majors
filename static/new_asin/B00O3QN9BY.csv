8681886,4,B00O3QN9BY,"Behind the scenes of the events leading up to the liberation of Paris during WW II (not a sure thing, as the Allies intended to bypass Paris and head straight for Berlin).  Dated, and most of the archive footage blended into the movie doesn't always blend smoothly, but still worth watching.",1474934400,,291,4.705882352941177

There is a meeting in East Prussia for the German High Command and Hitler. He orders them to fight to the last man, shoot the resisters, and burn Paris. Signs say no bread, no food in Paris. Has Germany lost the war? The resistance in Paris want an uprising. French authorities order them to wait, the Allies will bypass Paris and head to the Rhine. The German general gives orders to suppress the French and destroy Paris! Political prisoners will be shipped to Buchenwald. The Germans will destroy Paris in 48 hours as per orders. The Swiss Consul meets the General to talk about the Geneva Convention for prisoners so there will be no massacres. Prisoners will be turned over to the Red Cross. Can they be rescued from the SS? People are loaded onto the train.

One man makes a futile attempt! The train leaves. The police were disarmed, they went on strike in protest. Some Frenchmen accept an offer of arms and ammunition. It is a trick! A young is a courier, she gets a ride in a car before curfew. The FFI (Free French of the Interior) begins its actions. The police Prefecture is occupied. Others raise the tricolor, they must go into action. Wine bottles are emptied to make Molotov Cocktails (petrol bombs). A German truck is attacked to gain arms and ammunition. Another truck is attacked. That German general gives orders to attack. But good guys with guns stop bad guys with guns. Machine guns are not match for cannons on tanks. Can they be stopped? Petrol bombs do the job. The German general orders a cease-fire. Most of the police stations and post offices are in FFI hands. They need to make contact with the Allies in Normandy.

A family offers refuge for the night. Can the couriers get through? Two policemen escort their automobile. The Parisians tear up the paving stones to create barricades, trees are cut down as well. The couriers meets an American general, Patton; but he cant change his plans. Major Gaulois wants to meet General LeClerc, he appeals for help. They show news movies from 1944. If the Allies arrive this will prevent the ordered destruction of Paris. The French resistance wants to form a new cabinet at the Matignon. Couriers travel on bicycles to take over the buildings.

General Bradley approves the operation. The French troops are cheered as they advance. They meet resistance but continue. They are on the way. German soldiers bring in explosives to destroy historical landmarks. The approaching French soldiers are greeted. The bells begin ringing after 4.5 years of silence. LeClercs forces arrive. German forces attack, the French counterattack. American troops arrive. German troops resist, but the German general surrenders to the French. The bells of Notre Dame ring out. Paris has been liberated and saved from destruction.

The credits list those who worked on this production. You will recognize some of the American actors, and a few of the French and German actors. This is a recreation of history, not an entertainment (but its not boring). A knowledge of history would help you to understand the background of French politics. The French army was sent if for obvious political purposes. The Allies bypassed Paris as it had no military significance.",1433808000,,3242,4.855334538878843
8681890,3,B00O3QN9BY,"This is a good movie but a strange DVD.  The original languages, if I'm not mistaken, were French, German and English; but neither French nor German audio is available on this DVD.  Instead you have to listen to the movie either in English, Italian or Spanish.  A movie primarily about the French resistance and French soldiers contains not a word spoken in French!  Otherwise the quality is good, and the movie itself is a nice French companion piece to old American war films; so if you really want to see this movie and can't find it anywhere else, it's recommended.  (I put the language on Italian with English subtitles and just pretended it was an Italian production.  But then I had to watch Orson Welles play the Swedish ambassador in dubbed Italian.)  The back of the box is covered in Asian script.  Strange import DVD.",1422057600,5,829,4.6689655172413795
8681891,4,B00O3QN9BY,Really interesting film.  The people portrayed are not the usual hero figures.  Nice to see a film where the characters make mistakes and still persevere.  The film shows people on all sides with insight into what makes do what they do.,1418256000,3,236,4.7073170731707314
