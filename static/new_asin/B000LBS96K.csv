8160631,5,B000LBS96K,I was a little nervous about ordering this since it was a used DVD. However it looks and plays like new. Since so much time has passed since this was made and Phelps has finished his career it is even more fascinating to watch. We get to see more of the personality of Phelps (normally he is very guarded and cliche'd) in interviews)as well as everyone that is in his life. This is one of the few times (only time?) we hear from his father. I enjoyed seeing Ian Crocker as I am a Texas ex and he as well as Aaron Piersol got me watching the sport at the Olympics and I have continued to watch even after both retired. I saw more insight into Crocker when observing where he trained as well as his battle with depression which I was not aware of. So glad he remained in the Austin area.,1368489600,,785,4.137254901960785
8160632,1,B000LBS96K,"Why in the world would any body purchase an item, if the item's information page does not describe weather the item is a book or a DVD?  No where on any of the information does it describe what it is you may be buying.  What a Joke!  If it's a DVD (Movie) then say it's a damm DVD.
By not saying anything we can only assume it's a Book.  After reading other reviews, I discover it's not a book!  Again I ask, why would anybody buy this if they do not know what there buying?  No thanks for me!",1207440000,3,493,3.9292929292929295
