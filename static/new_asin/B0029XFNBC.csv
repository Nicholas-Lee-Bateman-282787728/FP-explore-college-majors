3881990,4,B0029XFNBC,"I had the impression that this was a little box with a bunch of dvd's in sleeves with a holographic image on the outsides that make it look like Bender's head is in a tank.  So I was surprised to find a very large box on my doorstep. The pic you are looking at is a box with clear windows and Bender's 'real-sized' head is in there!  Awesome! You open a hatch in the back of his head and all the dvd's are stacked vertically in grooves.  It's a fantastic and fun concept.  I feel like I got so much more than I bargained for since the head is a fun display piece.

Though here's the reason for the 4 stars:  The hatch is sort of hard to open... though I suppose it won't flop open on it's own.  My real issue is with the dvd rack once you open Bender's hatch.  They are spaced very close together in those grooves AND it's kind of annoying to get the dvd lined up quite right when pushing it back in it's right slot.  You have to really focus to make sure you are sliding it in right.  Also, it's kind of hard to pull out the disks by holding them on the edge.  You can, but just another 1/4"" would have been nice. It makes you want to pinch the dvd on the flat parts, which leads to smudges.  Also, you can't see what dvd's you are grabbing until you pull it out a little to check.  They come stacked in order, so you just count down til you get to the right one.  A directory on the inside of that hatch would be nice, in fact I'm going to make one myself.

So the content is definitely 5 stars, anyone considering this already knows that.  The head as a collector's item is way fun.  The head as a dvd holder is a bit difficult though.  I really like opening up Bender to pick out a disc, but could definitely see storing these dvd's in a sleeved case in the future.  Another reason I'd do that is because the box bender came in makes a fun display too since it makes it look like his head is in a tank of water.  So the last thing you'd want to do to get to an episode is to open the box, pull out Bender, fumble to pry open Bender, count down to which one you want and try not to scuff it while pulling it out....repeat.

Note to fox, it would be great if you could open the hatch by pressing Bender's antenna, that's how he activates things on the show.  It would also be great if when you pressed on the antenna you got a nice 'bit my shiny metal @#$' or any other Benderisms.",1256169600,110,2383,3.9831223628691985
3881991,4,B0029XFNBC,"I love futurama and already have the old box sets, but ordered this since I had slacked off on buying the features and this was not much more money than buying them. Great bargain price, really. My only beef is that when it arrived, all the discs were out of their slots, some with visible damage (hopefully doesnt effect playback, but now i need to check them all quickly so i can hopefully exchange if some of the discs are unplayable). Figured this was worth a mention though as it reminds me of the halo 3 debacle (discs damaged during shipping in special edition cases that microsoft ended up offering to replace). Im hoping mine all play fine, but if not id hope that microsoft's example would be followed.",1255392000,46,712,4.5271317829457365

3881994,5,B0029XFNBC,"Best collection to date, bought this back in 2010. Definitely grabs attention when friends see it. Discs are held in pretty well, but I had to use velcro as a latch to keep his head from spewing out all the discs if someone accidentally knocked it down. Extra content is nice too.",1408492800,,280,4.403846153846154
3881995,5,B0029XFNBC,"I bought mine on eBay for around $80, much more reasonable and affordable than Amazon. The only thing is it is only Volumes 1-5, but buying the remaining 3 Volumes (6-8) at an average of $10 each on Amazon wasn't too bad. Never cared about the movies though but I am sure getting them later would not be too much of a challenge.

Overall, the series is incredibly funny and enjoyable. If you like slapstick or dry and sarcastic humor with a bit of silliness, then this is the show for you. I was pretty skeptical when the show first aired on television. The characters were drawn in a similar style to the The Simpsons, whom I have loved and worshiped since my childhood, but it was all sci-fi-ish and even more elaborate than how it was in the greater former show. So I was worried it wouldn't be as funny because it seemed to have moved in such a huge divergent movement that maybe it wouldn't be able to hold its own. Despite that, Futurama should not have been that much of a surprise since Matt Groening was the one who brought the The Simpsons characters to life and eventually to fame and stardom. So I gave Futurama a chance. Obviously, it was a different show with a much faster pace but over time it proved to be another awesome show with a lot of random acts and dialogue of ridiculousness that I really really loved to watch and giggle at. The characters are sort of a parody of us/society that is mostly based on certain stereotypes that may or may not always be true and even cooler, us in the future. There are those who are shallow and self-centered but at other times, they are kind and sacrificial of themselves in order to give the greater good to others. So we love them because they are awesome.

About the Bender's head case, if you are a big fan of Futurama, you should not let minor discrepancies deter you from getting this collector's item. If it isn't perfect, you can just add more to it to make it better or return it and get your money back if you are that dissatisfied. But this is something you should definitely consider if you know how cool it would be to have a Bender head in your room. Plus this is supposedly the entire collection already so it should be perfect. Also you can find used ones from other sellers online too. Amazon isn't the only place where you can find cool things like this Bender head.",1404691200,,2342,4.3692660550458715

3882004,4,B0029XFNBC,"Good, not great. I absolutely love this show and was quite excited to see it in a special Bender head container but if you worry about potential disk scratches, I wouldn't recommend it. The one and only problem I've had (other than the earlier DVDs not having a play all) is that the disks are not very well seated so even a slight bump causes them to fall and move about the inside of the case.

This series is hilarious! I've been a fan from the start. I am looking forward to getting Seasons 7, 8 and 9 to keep my collection up to date.

Great, mindless fun; and as Bill Cosby said in Fat Albert's opening: ""...if you're not careful, you might learn something...""

3882009,1,B0029XFNBC,"I ordered this item through an Amazon affiliated vendor, so this review is not against Amazon, or Futurama as a series, but rather the actual product itself.

The packaging used to house Bender's head is sub-standard in every way: from the flimsy film of plastic used for product viewing to the nearly non-existent protective packaging protecting Bender's head.  Be prepared to get a box that looks like it has gone through hell and back, and don't be surprised if the Bender head is damaged (like mine was) or missing parts.

Once you open the box, the Bender head is pretty cool; until you open it up to see your DVDs.  The shelves they are on are too close together, which causes some rubbing between the DVDs and on the edges that rest of the slots.  The DVDs in the box I received were actually in a jumbled pile at the bottom of the space, and almost all of them had scratches or some sort of damage to them.  A few were even warped from being crammed into the space.  More than half of the DVDs were unreadable, and nearly all that were readable skipped in multiple places.

Needless to say, I sent the product back (which is another horrible story concerning the vendor that I won't go into detail about here).

Obviously, when you break down the cost of buying seasons 1-4 and the 4 movies individually it makes good financial sense to buy this package and save yourself some money.  (And you get a cool Bender head, but I would suggest you avoid storing the DVDs in it and just use it for decoration.)  However, with all of the problems I had with it (and the countless reports of other people having the same problem) I'm going to stick with obtaining each season individually.

If you do order it, I truly hope you are one of those who have no issues with it whatsoever.",1348012800,2,1782,4.449230769230769

3882011,1,B0029XFNBC,the Product while it was not damaged is missing a piece. Damaged or not all pieces should be included or listed as not included. I am hoping you have it and get back to me soon about this or you can have it back...,1340409600,,214,3.8863636363636362
3882012,4,B0029XFNBC,"Well, the rumors are TRUE about displaced discs, poor planning and poor packaging, but this is still a cool collector piece.  BENDER'S HEAD IS AWESOME, AND IT IS NICELY DONE.  When my package arrived, I was worried about whether or not I would have unplayable discs and the other concerns I've read about.

The package was not well-packed.  There was cushioning on the bottom of the box, but not on the top of the box.  If the box had gotten flipped or dropped or had something heavy sat on top of it, my product would have been damaged.  The Futurama box was beat to hell, but luckily, my Bender Head survived without damage.  But it was PURE LUCK, NOT GOOD PLANNING on the part of Amazon.

The discs were all misaligned and misplaced inside of the Bender Head.  I had to separate them all, sort them out, check out the discs that might have been damaged, and put them all back in order in their respective slots.  It was a pain; I'll be honest!

As far as using the set, it IS slightly impractical, but not terrible.  The main problem is that the slots in the back don't go all the way across (which makes it harder to take the CDs out and especially to put them back in and also contributed greatly to the misplacing of the discs during shipping) and it is also difficult to figure out which disc is which when you are grabbing one, since there is no label.  I took a suggestion from an earlier review and printed out a label and glued it to the back of the head where the CDs are stored.  Someone made a list of the episodes and colors on the forum.  I pasted it into Word, printed it, cut it down to size, and glued it into place.  [See Photo - Image 15 for product]

The only complaint was that the box looked like it had been punched in and was almost open. The product box was damaged in that the plastic on the front of the box was almost completely torn off the box.

However, this is the only time this has ever happened.

This product is great and is surely worth the price to get all the early episodes.

3882022,5,B0029XFNBC,"Futurama is one of those shows that's just lightyears ahead of its time. Created by none other than Mr. Matt Groening (The Simpsons). Futurama boasts quite the cast of characters. They've got everything from a dorky and unintelligent pizza guy (voiced by the same guy that played Doug on Nickelodeon), A purple haired cyclops (Katy Sagal from Married with Children), An alcoholic robot (John DiMaggio) and tons more. One of the best things about Futurama is that the show doesn't follow any particular timeline. This means you can essentially just watch any episode you want as they've all got their own plots. I would recommend starting with the first one just because it introduces the main cast.

The set is essentially not ""complete"" as there was another season (season 5) that was just released on DVD. This set contains seasons 1-4 and all of the feature length movies. The packaging is great and perhaps the neatest thing is that it can be repackaged and placed on a shelf as a collector's item. It contains 18 discs housed in the back of Bender's head. I heard a lot of complaints about the set up but have had no issues with disc scratching or anything else of that nature.

If you're looking to get into the show I recommend watching a few clips on YouTube or Hulu before buying this. If you like the show you can't go wrong with this set. It's definitely a total nerd fest but it's got some of the best sarcastic and dry humor I've ever seen.

5 stars for the set, the packaging and the show itself.",1317254400,2,1510,4.564575645756458

3882025,4,B0029XFNBC,"After reading other people's reviews about their DVDs being damaged during shipping, I was nervous for my own discs, especially when I found my Amazon box with a side of it dented inwards. When I opened it up, I found that the box bender's head came in was also dented. I was disappointed, because I was planning to store Bender's head in this box to keep the affect of his head being in a jar like the presidents and celebrities in the show. Although the condition of my package wasn't what I expected from Amazon, I am relieved that my DVDs (the most important stuff) were in perfect condition. None had fallen to the bottom, were scratched, or didn't play.

Bender's plastic head is well made, looks great (I would have preferred if he had a different expression or came with an interchangable set of eyes) and I didn't have trouble opening the door on the back of his head. As many other reviewers have said before me, You have to squeeze the door before pulling open. Inside his head are 19 discs labled 1-19. The 4 seasons are color coded and the 4 movies are at the bottom. I should mention the first 7 discs (seasons 1&2) Do not have a ""play all"" option on the menu because they are copies of the old DVDs. This doesn't really bother me, but some customers seem unhappy that not all of the disks can ""play all."" The method of storage wasn't given too much thought. While the outside of Bender looks great, the shelving inside was a slight dissapointment. It is still possible to remove the disks by holding the sides instead of pinching them and causing smudges, but the task requires more work than neccessary. Also, you have to pay attention when placing the disks back inside if you are to allign them correctly on the slots. I am concerned that over time, the disks will become scratched because they are not placed in sleeves. I am currently looking for rounded DVD sleeves or cases that would still fit inside bender's head. If I cannot find them, I will probably just store the disks in jewel cases outside Bender's head.

What many people don't realize before throwing the box away, is that inside there is a complete episode guide and a letter from Matt Groening and David X. Cohen inside a white envelope. Some reivewers claim it was hiding underneath the cardboard flaps at the bottom of the box, but it wasn't the case for me. Overall, I would definatly reccommend this product to others. Had it been less abused during delivery and included sleeves for the discs, I wouldn't have deducted a star from this product. The content deserves 5 stars. The show itself is great and the collection is jam packed with bonus content. Keep in mind this is not technically the ""Complete Collection"" anymore since Comedy Central has been putting out new episodes. It is the original 4 seasons (72 episodes [fullscreen]) plus ""season 5"" (the 4 movies [widescreen]) from 1999-2009. This is a great purchase for fans who don't own the series yet, fans wanting to replace their old collection, or collectors who want Bender's head.

This Collectable DVD Collection is not only great for a fan of the show, but is built with some fairly nice quality that makes it also a great display piece.

** INCLUDED DVD's **
This Complete Collection really can't be considered ""Complete"" anymore, with the return of Futurama to TV.  What this collection contains is everything prior to the show going to Comedy Central.  You get Season's 1 - 4 and all 4 feature movies(Technically Season 5).  All together this makes 19 DVD's.  The Disks contain all the extras that the standard retail versions contain, but some disks do lack a ""play all"" feature which might upset some.

** DVD PICTURE QUALITY / FEATURES **
Seasons 1 - 4 will be in FULL SCREEN.  However because I own a 1080p upscale DVD player it automatically converts to widescreen for me.  Even up-scaling from 480p DVD to 1080p the transfer looks fantastic.  Season 5 (the 4 movies) are naturally in Widescreen and look just as good as the first 4 seasons.  Most of the disks will contain bonus content: Deleted Scenes, animate clips, how to draw the characters, Artwork etc.  It really feels like you are getting a 100% complete package here for Seasons 1 - 5

The DVD's themselves are stored in the back of Bender's head.  ** This is perhaps the only negative I have to the entire set **  While the disks are held nice and secure once the door to his head is shut, when open a small bump could send disks flying everywhere. Plus during shipping the disks all collapsed on themselves, but no damage occurred.  Each disk is held on a small ledge and when the door is shut, soft foam pads press against the disks to hold them snug in place.  It is a good system but also flawed if you plan to carry the head around with you, since movement can dislodge the disks from their thin ledge.  Disk 1 and 19 also can be a bit hard to get out due to their placement.  While not impossible those two disks might fight back!

....Speaking of Bender's head... Despite the small flaw in how the disks are supported inside the head (flimsy ledges) the head is beautiful!  It is made of plastic but has great detail and work put into it.  The head is life-sized also and comes with a rubber antenna you can attach at the top.  To access your DVD's there is a door in the back of his head you open.

*** To open the door PRESS IN softly and then pull.

While Bender's head looks awesome sitting on the table, giving me a mean look in the process, the box the piece comes in is even better.  When the head is inside it looks as if Bender's head is in a glass jar like all the presidents and famous celebrities on the show.  It gives you that option to store it either out of the box or in the box, giving the piece two distinct looks.

OVERALL
This is a must have for a huge Futurama fan.  Not only are you getting the first five seasons on DVD, plus all the extras, but you also are getting a great collectable piece in Bender's head which doubles as the DVD holder.  The quality is excellent despite the slight problem with the DVDs and heavy movement.  Overall this is a 5 star product worth paying for!

** NOTE: If you want to store the Head in the original box you can not have Bender's antenna connected.
** NOTE: It would of been nice to add a small audio feature where Bender says a line from the show either when you open the DVD back, or perhaps make it so his antenna could be pressed like a button and it would speak.",1308182400,2,3599,4.308035714285714
3882032,5,B0029XFNBC,"I will save my opinion of the show and focus on the actual product here.

If you're a fan of ""Futurama,"" this is probably the best way to get the original run of the show.  It comes with all of the original episodes and the four feature length movies all inside of Bender's head.  The episodes are transferred onto DVD very well.  They look and sound great.

The package is excellent.  The box itself looks cool.  But what you don't get the best impression of is that the discs are really INSIDE Bender's head.  Yup, that's not just his face on a box, the front of that box is clear and that's his actual head inside there!!!

The discs fit in well and I had no trouble removing any of them.  I have read some reviews that have said that the back of the head is a bit hard to open, but I had no problems with that.  The key is that you need to ""squeeze"" the door on the back of the head instead of pulling on it where it looks like you should pull on it.  Just squeeze in that spot and it will pop right open.

The actual head is pretty cool looking.  It's quite a bit bigger than I anticipated but that's not a bad thing.  It will look fantastic with all of my other ridiculous DVD sets.

Overall, I think the product is great and I'm really glad I bought it.  If you're a fan of the show, this is a must have.  If you're a fan of awesome DVD collections, this is also a must have.

Highly recommended.",1300752000,2,1403,4.054744525547445
3882033,5,B0029XFNBC,I ordered this collection for my husband's birthday. I was worried after reading the reviews that it was going to be hard to open and difficult to insert the dvds. I was very relieved when it came and I saw I had worried for nothing. We had a lot of the individual dvds from earlier purchases but we love the Bender head storage/display. I would recommend this collection for any Futurama lover.,1299888000,,395,4.5
3882034,5,B0029XFNBC,"This is really an excellent purchase for any Futurama lover! I bought it for my bf, and it was the envy of several friends and family members over the holidays. The episodes are--of course--classic and wonderful. The extras, deleted scenes, and easter eggs are belligerent and numerous. (Although one always wants more deleted scenes and easter eggs!) And the scowling, disembodied head of Bender watches over us as we sleep!

Really the only con I can come up with is that the whimsical storage is a little annoying. The discs are piled vertically in the back of Bender's head. No protection, casing, or anything. So trying to dig one out risks scratching or dropping. It's especially bad if you're not sure which one you want to watch. Each disc is concealed by the disc on top of it, and they're packed in there tightly, so it's hard to slide one out to peek at the label. Also, if the discs were at least in cases, they could have episode descriptions readily available. Sometimes it's hard to figure out which one we want to watch.

But these are minor issues. And they lose any power the minute you realize your pulling discs out of a robot head! How much does that rule?! If you know a true, dedicated Futurama lover, this is the way to go.",1297382400,,1247,4.5377777777777775

If you're a Futurama fan, you HAVE to get this.  Having all the episodes is awesome enough, but having them inside this huge Bender head is even better.  My only complaint is that the case uses Bender's angry eyes (with the brows furrowed).

The design is functional (with fully non-functioning antennae!) as well as decorative. One thing I found a little annoying was the fact that only random discs had a ""play all"" button, and sometimes the menus of the discs took some time to load. The menu designs are detailed and truly capture what made Futurama so great! I haven't watched too many special features, but do enjoy the deleted scenes included with this feature.

The Bender-head storage system works surprisingly well; I can report that my copy arrived with no discs having fallen out of place or being affected with any kind of scuffing. It is, as one reviewer mentioned, a little difficult to retrieve the top- and bottom-most discs, but not so difficult as to cause damage to either the DVDs or the user's pride. I look at it this way: Each season on its own goes for $15-20 retail.

The series was fantastic and has held up reasonably well over time. The movies are all very clever though tinged with a bit of sadness because of the missed opportunity to make this show more of a long term institution. The Bender head is cool, but the automated DVD loader tends to just jam them in so you can expect to find the various DVDs wedged in uncomfortable and potentially damaging positions. Despite that my DVDs were all just fine once I delicately unwedged them and slid them into their proper slots. The DVDs in this set are exactly the same as the first releases of the seasonal sets and movies, except for the labels, which instead go from 1-18 but clearly identifying the contents of the DVD.

The packaging loses a star, though.  It's not totally clear from the picture, but the front of the box isn't a picture; it's a cellophane film.  That's right, the Complete Collection is packaged in Bender's severed head (there's a trapdoor on the back of his head).  While I initially found this (and the detachable antenna) hilarious, it soon became clear that Bender's head is unwieldy (and honestly kind of creepy, as though Isaac Asimov had written the movie Se7en) and because of it won't fit on my shelf.  I'm not an enthusiastic enough collector for this.

Bender's great, though!",1271203200,,791,4.607142857142857
3882057,4,B0029XFNBC,"""Futurama"" is an awesome show, and this package has it all (up to date). It's a great opportunity to buy it all inside Bender's head, at a good price. There are also lots of special features, including commentary for each and every episode! (available from the language menu).

On the plus side, the shape of Bender's head is very cool, as you can see from the pictures. When you actually see it in real size it's very impressive and looks like the real thing!
I've heard it's hard to open the door (at the back of the head, where the DVDs are) but actually, you just have to know how: Hold the head with your right hand and put your left hand on the door - four fingers on the left side of the door, and then, on the right side, slightly press it in with your thumb and pull towards your fingers and voila!

On the minus side, it's not very comfortable to take out a DVD or to insert it, and you have to be careful not the scratch the discs. Also, you can't know which DVD (number) you're pulling out until you've pulled it or unless you've counted from the top.

I thought there's no episode guide, but apparently there is, it was hided very well under the box flaps at the bottom and just can't be seen unless you pull them out and look for it... (but why would you do that, unless you already know it's there? There's no word on the cover or any clue how to find it...)

3882059,5,B0029XFNBC,I already owned all 4 seasons before I bought this. Some of my discs were begining to skip due to high use over sevral years. So I bought this to replace a few of my boxed sets and add the 4 movies to my collection in the process. I originally bought this set in a local eletronics store because of the review stating that shipping lead to the discs getting scratched and falling out while sealed in the box. It turns out that the one I bought locally had that problem. the top 10 discs were falling out when I opened it. Most of them were scratched. I went to exchange it but the store had stopped carring it. I decided to buy it at Amazon. I was in Luck! It was in perfect shape! It was shipped fast and was packed nicely. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.,1270771200,,766,4.113333333333333
3882060,5,B0029XFNBC,"Anyone who is a fan of Futurama, or who likes good comedy for that matter, should buy this product. The show is nothing less than brilliant. Edgier than the Simpsons, but still more tasteful than South Park, the show blends amazing music and scenery with a great storyline in each sidesplitting episode. The actual product, i.e. Bender's head containing the DVDs, is perfect for those seeking to get the most out of this show.

1) For one thing, the product contains all the episodes prior to the series 2010 return to television. Call me a pessimist, but I am not sure how long these guys can continue to maintain their quality. I sincerely hope that they do, but in the event that they can't, you should be secure in the knowledge that every episode contained within this product is golden.

2) The DVDs contain extra features like deleted scenes and audio commentary by the actors, composers, directors, producers etc. The audio commentary is by far my favorite since you get to hear some interesting facts about each individual episode that may have eluded you. Plus, it is very interesting to notice the kind of jokes that the creators find amusing. Finally, it is a treat to hear the actors weave their characters' voices into their conversations in the commentary, essentially giving the audience some tidbits that are spontaneous and entertaining.

3) This might be a bit nitpicky, but the visual and audio quality is much better than that of episodes on TV. I became fully aware of the beautiful coloring and some almost indistinct sounds as a result of purchasing the DVDs. Furthermore, the episodes on television have greater constraints in terms of time; and so, the DVD version has greater latitude in keeping some jokes from being cut. Nevertheless, the difference between the two versions might not be significant, but I already said I was being a bit nitpicky.

4) I suppose that one could get the same content from elsewhere for a cheaper price (though I doubt it), but think of it this way: for the difference in price you get to be friends with Bender. How cool is that?

Finally, I must add that I am in agreement with previous reviewers about the hatchback issue. This product is only for those who have evolved opposable thumbs AND have an IQ of at least 5 points.",1270684800,,2286,4.733668341708543

I had some trouble getting the hatch on the back of Bender's head to open the first time, but I figured out the trick to it.

3882073,5,B0029XFNBC,"Heck he's probably Angry because of the disc's not being properly secured,
It would have been nice if they placed some foam spacers between each disc
or made it so you had to put them in yourself. Some of the disc's managed to
get in positions to where they where very difficult to remove.

Overall it's a great collection to have, didn't know before I got it that it also came with
all 4 of the movies put out in 2009, which is an added plus, saves me from having to buy them.
Another plus is that the episodes seem to be in the proper order. I was going to get the seasons
off of Itunes but they had them all wrong and I wouldn't have gotten a cool bust of Bender.",1263945600,,666,4.045454545454546

3882076,5,B0029XFNBC,"Just received the bender head with all 19 dvds.  It looks like other people on here have had issues with the bender head storage case, but I think it's great.  It arrived very secure and the latch on the back is really sturdy so it does take some effort to open it every time, but I'd rather have it more sturdy than not.  The case is a great and novel idea and pretty funny when you have friends come over and say ""what the heck is that?"".

When you open the box, make sure to check underneath the cardboard flaps, because that is where the episode listing is and also a numbered letter from Matt G.  According to the letter, they've made 25,500 of these and the letter will tell you which one you have.  I know there was an earlier edition of 1000 which was identical to this but only sold at Comicon and cost the full retail price of $199.95.  So, for about half that price, you can pick up an identical edition except that its out of 25,500.

I find the dvds relatively easy to remove and put back.  So, that doesn't seem to be an issue for me as it has been for others.

Aside from all that, the dvds are jam packed with every episode and all movies that have been released as well as commentary for every episode and loads of extras.

So, if you're a fan of the show, you are absolutely going to love this.  Buy and enjoy!",1261267200,10,1328,4.14453125

I am a big fan of the series but, seriously, I can only be deceived when I see that the first dvds I bought were much expensive and uglier in comparison. I'm not gonna buy these items again, as I'm sure they will re-edit this again some time soon.",1260144000,,289,4.178571428571429
3882078,5,B0029XFNBC,"I already own all the DVD seasons and movies, but the Bender head case is a must-have for all the die-hard Futurama fans.

The head looks very cool anywhere, has a nice detailed finish, and has all the Futurama until 2009!
Of course, we will get more Futurama in 2010, but this is a unique item, well, unique next to other 25499 Bender heads.

This collection includes:
 - Plastic Bender head case (almost real life size)
 - Rubber de-attachable antenna
 - 19 DVDs (15 of the seasons, 4 of the movies). Of course, you'll get all the extras, easter eggs, languages and features that each original DVD has.
 - A letter from Matt Groening and David X Cohen talking about the support of the fans to the Series in all this 10 years. Includes the number of Bender head you bought.
 - A guide to know which episode is on each disc (something that people complained in some of the reviews, trust me, is inside the box)

Minor complaints:
 - I wish that the DVD discs layout were like the original ones, more detailed. Is nice to see different images, but the designs are too simple in my opinion.
 - the 1st and 19th (last) DVD discs are difficult to pull out.

Recommendations:
 - To open the Bender head from the back, DON'T PULL the back door, lightly (and gently) push it from the dented site and then pull.
 - To pull out a disc, you'll have to pull it with your fingers like a clamp (The Clamps!)
 - To put the disc back in the case, you can do it by holding the disc with your fingers from the edges.

About the packaging:
 - I pre-ordered and bought the item in order to ship internationally to Ecuador, South America. The printed box came inside a box of the same size, and that box was inside a bigger box with some neat extra big air-cushion plastic bags. The discs are flawless!
 - I wanted to cancel the order I made for this collection one day earlier from the release date (I didn't had a lot of money), but it was impossible. I was told not to receive the item here, and when the package returns to Amazon, I'll get a refund. I changed my mind and it was the best choice. I love my Bender head and the DVD discs inside!

3882079,5,B0029XFNBC,"This is an amazing box set... one of the most detailed and comprehensive that I've seen in a series box.  The total size is a little bigger than a basketball. The Bender head is well detailed (for a cartoon head) and arguably ""life-size"".  The front and back window display the ""head"" and there's a hatch in the back for DVD storage. The sides are mock photographs that create a refraction effect that water can give to fish in aquariums when viewed at an angle.  I have not opened it, but the label outside says that the antenna is included for the top.  This set includes all the DVDs and movies which is about the same price as buying all the items together (as of this writing).  Definitely worth the $117 where it's priced now.
