8739317,1,B017HMM3T4,"Worst movie I have seen in a very long time, After the first 5 mins you will understand why it didn't make it to theaters, it was recordeD with a potato, and produced by a 12 year old juvenile autistic child.",1457222400,,208,4.097560975609756
8739318,3,B017HMM3T4,The beginning wasn't necessary had no vision for the film. The movie was so ridiculous in the beginning you watched just to what happened. It actually began when Puff went talk to Quick. Nice story line but stupidly protrade. Need better quality.but sound track at credits on point. Would look to get a copy of soundtrack. Movie and quality could be so much better.,1456876800,,365,4.71875
