5241506,5,B0091D48KK,If you like comedy and Christmas this is the movie for you.  I love this movie and it's right there with Christmas Vacation.,1354060800,,124,4.391304347826087
5241507,5,B0091D48KK,Cute movie starring Mark Ruffalo before his stardom days. Nothing special about the disc except the movie. My last review. I shouldn't have to be forced to type so many words.,1352937600,2,175,4.67741935483871
5241508,2,B0091D48KK,"The random case cover, disc & DVD menu art work that has nothing to do with the movie really bothers me. The 'chapter selection' reads ""Chapter 1"", ""Chapter 2"" ,""Chapter 3"", etc- but no pictures or titles to tell us at which point of the movie these chapters will lead too (in the movie itself there are title cards to break between scenes, but the chapter selections poorly miss them by about 5 seconds, or don't use them at all). The CD is just really unnecessary, and the movie itself looks somewhat better than if you recorded it on your DVR or even a VHS whenever it aired on TV, but I wouldn't say by much. Not to mention the movie title has always been written as ""On The 2nd Day of Christmas"" where as on this case it's written ""Second"". When you put the movie in and the title comes up, it's ""2nd"" so I think it's really obvious how quick and careless this was done.  I gave it two stars because I really love this movie and was glad people decided to release it, no matter how lacking the release is... but I advise people to, if you have it recorded or can find it online, to burn it to a disc yourself and buy a cheap case, because you aren't getting much better with this, and would cost less. I actually (with the help of my label maker) made new covers for the case&DVD with pictures from the actual movie, and quickly typed up where each chapter leads on a piece of paper to just stick in the case (like some DVDs actually come with). I also took the CD&it's holder out, it was easy enough. Unfortunately I can't change what it looks like when the DVD menu comes up on screen, but I am just glad to own the movie, so maybe I shouldn't complain so much? = )",1352332800,11,1672,4.176470588235294
5241509,5,B0091D48KK,I love this movie Ive wanted to own it the minute Id seen it. It is a great family movie. I took it for my Grandparents and my Aunts to watch it we all had a great family time watching this movie and eating popcorn and apples. This has been a family tradition since I was 9 years old. It means alot to my family to watch great family movies together as a family. Thanks for getting this item here promptly.,1352246400,9,406,4.0246913580246915
5241510,5,B0091D48KK,"Christmas Eve is just like any other work day for pickpocket Trish Tracy (Masterson) and her niece Patsy (Pratt). With a store full of Christmas shoppers with fat pocketbooks, Trish and Patsy start working the crowd. They manage quite a fortune before they're caught by sharp-eyed and big hearted security guard named Bert (Ruffalo). Rather than have Trish spend the Holidays in jail and turning over Patsy to Social Services, Bert offers to be temporarily responsible for the pair. This arrangement brings a Christmas that none of the will ever forget.",1352246400,2,553,5.087912087912088
5241511,5,B0091D48KK,"What a discovery!  Two of our favorite actors, Mary Stuart Masterson and Mark Ruffalo(And don't forget a bit by Howard aka Johnny Fever Hesseman)in a goofy but touching, holiday flick.  It has it all: comedy, romance, kids, New York backdrop, Santa's of different sorts and, of course, a theme about what's important this time of year.

Masterson plays a pick-pocket who works with her young ward, in tandem, fleecing the wealthy populace of New York City.  They don't steal from the poor, and they only take cash, no credit cards, and they mail back the wallets to the victims.  Hmm.  They get caught at a big department store by the security man, who wishes he was a  real policeman or a successful jingle tune writer, Ruffalo; however, the grumpy old owner, who wants to prosecute, decides to wait until after Christmas.  Ruffalo's character is forced to take her into his custody and home until then.  Whew, now that's a stretch of reality, but an entertaining one, as they struggle with the arrangement and each other and the growing feelings of attraction.

The story's humerous and lighthearted with lots of family interactions and sentiment.  We all know where this is headed, and for those of us who love these kind of movies, we joyfully go along and are not disappointed.  Family friendly plus they throw in a Christmas music CD- I'm ready let the holiday's begin!

Filmed in 1997, an ABC movie, it escaped me all these years.  Mary Stuart Masterson also has from that time period another romantic movie with some Christmas ties, ""Bed of Roses"" with Christian Slater.  Good stuff for diehard romantics.",1351814400,18,1613,4.835766423357664
5241512,4,B0091D48KK,"I love this movie, being a big Mary Stuart Masterson fan and a huge Mark Ruffalo fan.  This is one of the earliest movies I've seen him in.  I've watched this movie repeatedly for 15 years whenever I saw it by chance playing on t.v.  When we still had vcrs, I had a vhs tape, but obviously that medium is obsolete.  I'm so excited for it's release on dvd!  It's a great mix of holiday movie and romance!",1346112000,27,403,4.115384615384615
5241513,4,B0091D48KK,as expected no complaints,1455062400,,25,5.5
5241514,3,B0091D48KK,"This probably deserves a little better than three stars, but I didn't feel that four stars was quite right. I will have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the production of this older (late '90s) Hallmark Channel Christmas presentation. The acting was good and the storyline a little better than the usual. Well worth a holiday viewing.",1450310400,2,347,4.704918032786885

5241538,4,B0091D48KK,A cute little girl and her aunt make up a successful pickpocket pair working the city.  That is until a security guard at a big department store catches them.  The guard is forced by his boss to watch them until Monday when they can be booked.  The honest guard (Mark Ruffalo) and the crooked aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson) end up falling for each other as he struggles with the burden of taking care of them and fending off her old boyfriend who is a real low life being chased by leg breakers.  Entertaining tale that move right along.  Well worth the watch.,1419120000,,558,4.431372549019608

5241562,4,B0091D48KK,"If you have children under 13, I would watch it first.  There is nothing wrong with this movie, it is very cute and has a good lesson if you can find it.  It's a story about a woman caring for her young Nice.

The childs mother had passed and the Father is not in her life.  The Aunt takes her in and teaches her how to become a con.  The two get caught and the Aunt ends up falling in love with the security gaurd that captured them.  As with all movies that have happy endings,she changes her ways and goes stright.

In the meantime, the little girl starts to question if what they are doing is bad and if it is, than she will be on Santa's naughty list.  It's a typical love story set in the city at Chrsitmas Time. Again there is a moral to the story, but it is through the little girls eyes and you will need to look for it.",1375401600,,829,3.9518072289156625

What I'll never understand is...if you watch the movie in HD on Hallmark (which I did) and it looks clear and sharp...why can't the manufacturers of the dvds give us the same experience? I know it can be done. I just think these companies are too lazy to do a good job with the transfer. Watch A Princess For Christmas to see how it's done. If you can overlook the mediocre quality of the dvd, then you'll enjoy the movie.",1360022400,,533,4.184466019417476

5241579,4,B0091D48KK,"This movie is now 15 years old and only sporadically shown on TV (not at all this year, as I can see, because of an outright explosion of new Christmas TV movies).  So, it is nice to have it on DVD.
The plot for this movie had been filmed before, in the 1940's, with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck (titled ""Remember the Night"").  Pretty good back then, but a little on the dark side by modern Christmas movie standards.  This remake, makes it lighter than air, but also takes a little of the believability out of it.  However, the leads are great, and very likable, and who's to quibble.  It's a very entertaining way to spend a Christmas time evening.
By the way, this plot was used again, in ""Undercover Christmas"" with Jamie Gertz, and Tyne Daly.  (Not yet on DVD in 2012.)",1355529600,9,781,4.426573426573427

8534060,5,B0091D48KK,"Another nice Christmas romance, this one featuring a pair of pickpockets who try to work a store where an on-the-ball store security man catches them.  Out of the ordinary, it is; believable, well, it is not always that.  But it is a lot of fun and enough different so that it keeps your interest.  This one was made in 1997, but I'd never heard of it before.  I'm glad that Amazon made it available.",1457136000,,400,4.364864864864865
