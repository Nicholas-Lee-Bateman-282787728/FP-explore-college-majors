8594912,3,B00DNJ98CG,This is basically the same information from Tupac: Assassination .  I had already seen most of this already.  A wee bit disappointed.,1398902400,,133,5.0
8594913,5,B00DNJ98CG,"God bless Big Frank who's no longer with us on earth but has transitioned in the Kingdom of Heaven alongside with Tupac, bodyguard Michael Moore, Johnny J, and a # of others who were closed and worked with Tupac. So far my man Mr. Richard ""RJ"" Bond did a remarkable job re-creating, re-working some things that were left off from the previous versions of Tupac Assassination 1 and 2. Props to him, Atron and the others putting together in memory of Frank Alexander. Now he's at peace, he truly understands justice will be made responsible of his friend's death. Only GOD knows the real truth and the answer. Plus what I like about it while previewing this due to new music added, great effects, and so much more. Can't get enough of it and guarantee you fans, experts and supporters out there you'll never be dissapointed.

For my suggestion, I strongly advise you check out all the previous versions of TA 1 and 2 too that you've missed and so forth if you want to know the real truth. With the new edit (truly the final cut) will blow your mind away and scoot out any interference of what anybody can think. There's been numerous theories, slack and stuff that occured after Pac die plus with a # of witnesses that died and passed on that never had the oppurtunity to confess or appear in a court or be talked with the LVPD (Las Vegas Police Dept), why evidence (old and new) got exhausted and never been put forward to the table, why police were involved on both cases plus working with both labels Bad Boy and Death Row (both ran by Diddy and Suge Knight), what were they hiding that's not being told or presented till now, etc.....

For fans and experts who enjoyed the obsession studying and know more on the assassinations of JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X plus Abraham Lincoln will feel the same impression on both the Biggie and Tupac cases. I'm that way too because I can't get enough of it because it's very mind boggling. God bless Biggie and Tupac.

We forever love you still Big Frank Alexander and especially Michael Moore and Tupac. Rock on with the angels now!

We cannot give up, we still have a long way to go.",1392681600,,2141,4.468030690537084
