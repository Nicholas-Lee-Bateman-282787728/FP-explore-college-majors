7473178,2,B016JB0KN0,"Little hard to follow, not very good acting. Kind of like a weird hallmark movie. It was Serendipity meets Fools Rush In with scenes from other romantic comedies but not doing any of them justice. I don't remember laughing at all either, didn't even realize it was a comedy till the ending when their story becomes a sitcom, which you saw coming the moment his friend enters the picture.",1511481600,,387,4.6231884057971016

7473189,5,B016JB0KN0,"I enjoyed this very sweetly romantic and entertaining film about a guy who meets and falls in love with a Portuguese girl. And has to deal with her family. And has to deal with her fortune teller.

The characters were interesting, attractive, and funny. The plot - it's a romantic comedy, so a tiny bit formulaic as plots go - keeps your interest. It has some very funny lines that make me want to watch the film again. It even makes me want to learn Portuguese (although it helps if you are beautiful when you speak Portuguese).

Such a lovely movies that I will recommend it to my friend who tends to watch mainly Lifetime and Hallmark movies. She thinks there is too much sex and swear words in modern films (she's older) and this movie is clean but not boring at all!",1492905600,2,771,4.384615384615385

7473255,4,B016JB0KN0,"Absolutely loved this film. The cast was great. Only two complaints... I wasn't feeling the ending and although this movie was funny, it wasn't nonstop funny which it could've been. For example, look up ""The Portuguese Kids"" on Facebook and/or Youtube and you will piss yourself laughing when they show you Portuguese Families compared to American Families. This movie was missing out on that and they didn't have the Portuguese English Accent going on which quite honestly hysterical with that alone. Anyways I still loved it, it was charming and funny.",1483574400,2,554,5.0989010989010985

7473307,4,B016JB0KN0,"Pretty standard fare in the whole ""worlds collide, hilarious culture clash ensues"" romantic comedy genre, a la ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (with a Portuguese twist). The writing stays cute and admittedly one-note throughout, peppering in little double entendres and character quirks here and there, though some of the jokes fall flat whenever the film's humor overly relies on contrived situations rather than on the strength of the actors alone. Still, Scott and Sousa's on-screen chemistry help to ground the story and keep the viewer invested and though predictable, Scott's pathos throughout is genuinely heartwarming, especially whenever he takes a break from being the lovable goof. Finally, framing the entire movie by bookending the first initial meeting between Sousa and Scott's characters keeps the collection of moments from their relationship more interesting than the typical genre fare, as the characters contradict their idealistic portrayals of themselves in their real life situations. All in all, a very nice and simple movie. 4 stars",1481241600,5,1052,5.5

7473313,5,B016JB0KN0,"This is an adorable romantic comedy. There is great chemistry between the two main characters, Jack played by Ryan Scott, and Maria played by Jeannette Sousa. Their acting is very good and natural, as is the whole cast, especially best friend Wilson played by Vik Sahay.  Marias Portuguese family adds to the comedy with great characters. One of my favorite scenes is when Jack meets Marias family. The father is very funny in the way he shows his distaste of his daughters choice of a boyfriend.  There was not one bad performance in this film. The dog even holds his own and almost steals one of the scenes.
I LOLd within the first few minutes in the first scene at the Diner and many times through out.  The writing is excellent with a lot of good one liners.
While it was very funny there were also some very moving scenes, including the ending. I also enjoyed the music throughout the film. Definitely a feel good movie, I could watch over and over and I highly recommend.",1481155200,10,977,4.5397727272727275

That Ryan actor sure knows how to get a laugh :) sometimes though I had a feeling I knew what was going to happen and that's not always a good thing. Other moments suprised me!

7473323,2,B016JB0KN0,"As a person with some Portuguese heritage, who has been to Portugal and lived in a Portuguese neighborhood ... I find the film somewhat offensive. Too sanitized, too simplistic and not ethnic enough. Yes, I know it's a romantic comedy. But the clumsiness of the writing prevented me from suspending my disbelief. The locations were so bland. Was the family home in Canada or California? The little Portuguese souvenirs stood out like a sore thumb. Maybe if the family had more dignity and was less neurotic. Finally, the acting was subpar. Especially the dude who attempted to interpret Jack as the most boring ""writer"" and the least intellectual. His pal was more convincing, and would have made the better lead. The fortune teller did a better job, too. Also, noticed the ""position"" joke stolen from the film ""Serendipity.""",1480550400,,825,4.9855072463768115

7473349,1,B016JB0KN0,"This was not believable.  I don't know how it ends up because I turned it off.  She was meant to be a person of faith (most likely Catholic??) but she was willing to date a man who said he didn't believe in God and sleep with him outside of marriage--and then she got her advice on life from a Tarot card reader?  A person who had enough faith to wear a cross, hang a crucifix in her home AND object to someone taking the Lord's name in vain would never seek advice from a Tarot card reader--it's like this was written by someone who had no concept of what it really means to be a Catholic or what a person of faith is really like.

I sympathized with the situation at the start where some down-on-his-luck guy ran into his stylish, successful ex-wife and wanted a woman to pretend she was his girlfriend--not a bad start if a bit overused.  It just went downhill from there.  His personality was obnoxious and whiny and I couldn't figure out what she ever saw in him.  She was leagues above him in looks and personality.  They were a mismatch in every way.

So, they started in the diner where they met, then showed scenes of them dating, living together, etc., but kept cutting back to the diner, which just interrupted the flow of the movie and became annoying.

I'll watch a silly, poorly acted, badly written movie if it's funny or entertaining or the characters are likable or the plot interesting--this had NONE of that.  It wasn't funny.  The characters weren't likable.  The relationship didn't make sense.  The plot meandered and jumped back and forth and kept losing my interest.

So, I don't know if the movies was showing flash forwards to their actual life or if the whole movie actually took place in the diner and the flash forwards were imaginary or what ""might be"" if they continue the relationship or if there is some other twist.  I just don't care and can't stomach watching more to find out.",1479081600,6,1913,4.469740634005763

Then there is the ""faith-based"" component interspersed with her Portuguese superstitions -- which aren't really -- they don't believe in smudging for example... additionally - they eat fish more than they eat pork -- and since this took place in NYC, and they went to RI to visit her family (which is on the OCEAN and not that BIG) fish would be more common than pork.

Other than that, A Date with Miss Fortune is a cute, feel good movie that has me reminiscing of the movie Serendipity. The largest difference is that unlike the latter, this movie moves forward, then backward in time. Well, sort of. I'll let you watch it first to make your own judgement on what you think is happening.
The acting is good, largely from the main characters who draw you into their world, making you laugh, cry, and frustrated at different times. In my opinion, this is the mark of good acting.

7474123,5,B016JB0KN0,"Clever and unique, witty, funny, great characters and acting, well written. The two main characters really sync, making the plot believable.

8736555,5,B016JB0KN0,"I surprisingly found mi amor in another country, then we came to the US and started it all over again.  So we thought this movie captured some great moments in the painful awkwardness of love, a love which knows no boundaries and endures a goofy gringo's deseo de perseguir el amor de su vida.  We liked how the richness of her culture enhanced his life and if you pay attention you will see the moment of belief.  New beginnings come each day when you open your eyes.

8736556,5,B016JB0KN0,"This is a feel good, romantic comedy. The movie begins with a chance first date and then flashes forward to their present day. relationship. As the storyline continues, we're shown flashbacks to that first date. This format highlights the differences between how the characters present themselves on the first date and the reality of how they are in the future relationship. This not only added to the comedy, it also helped with character development. I became invested in the characters and really wanted them to have a successful relationship. The main characters also have amazing chemistry. It's no surprise that the actors are married in real life. I loved this movie and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching romantic comedies.",1526428800,,746,5.122950819672131

He presented as a person looking for a relationship initially, but then his humor was disrespectful to the female actress. I wondered why she hung around to be insulted, then I remembered that some writer dictated all that. He is the one I should be criticizing.",1526083200,,435,4.4375
8736558,2,B016JB0KN0,"Actually, I remember trying to watch this before. It's probably a  likeable enough for most people, cultural differences and such. I just have a pet peeve of not liking uncomfortable movies where families are all judgmental toward the young couple in love and we have to suffer through all that family conflict. In general, can't stand relationship conflict movies of any kind if it's like the main theme of the movie, so don't go by my rating.",1523145600,,444,4.766233766233766
8736559,4,B016JB0KN0,"If you're in the mood for a sweet romantic comedy, that brings a twist to the basic format of rom-coms, this one is pretty good. As another reviewer stated, I've seen some bad rom-coms on Amazon Prime, and this one turned out to be really enjoyable. I was surprised at the 3-star rating. The flashbacks remind me of the show ""This is Us"". What a coincidence that the male lead character and the one in ""This is Us"" are both named Jack.",1521417600,,435,4.317073170731708
8736560,2,B016JB0KN0,"I don't think the barrier here was cultural differences, it was the way they treated each other.  If this is the way people in love act with each other I can't understand why they would want to be married.  I didn't even watch the last 25 minutes because they probably got married anyway which makes no sense to me.  The only time they acted kindly or interested in each other was when they first met and sat in the diner to talk. It seemed all downhill from there.",1519084800,,465,4.261363636363637

But overall great movie, if your a romantic your in for a great treat.",1512000000,,328,4.125
