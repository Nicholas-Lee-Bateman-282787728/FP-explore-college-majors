5277706,3,B0099115XW,"These workouts were not what I expected.  Since it is for ""weightloss"" I expected the workouts to be more challenging and work up more of a sweat.  This is not the only video I'm using, so I cannot tell if it is making a significant impoact on my weight or not.  I would do other workouts during the week and use this as a supplement versus relying solely on this workout for weightloss.

That being said, I do like using it because it is easy and also relaxing, so it is good to use before going to bed at night or if you do not have enough energy to do an intense cardio workout.

The one thing I really dislike about this video is her cues to not exactly match up to what she is doing on screen (they often come too early, sometimes too late).  Also, she does not always describe in enough detail what she is doing, so it is difficult when you are not in a position to look at the screen.  This is my biggest pet peeve when using workout videos, especially if they are yoga or pilates videos.",1359936000,33,995,4.124352331606218

Being new to yoga I was not sure that I could keep up but this dvd has plenty of good instruction with suggested modifications!
I love the setting that the DVD was filmed in....nature at its best.  Just watching Colleen move in this environment was a treat.
My favorite was the core workout. The energy I felt from completing this program lasted all day. LOVE IT!
I recommend it HIGHLY!",1359331200,,417,4.635135135135135

5277709,5,B0099115XW,I use this on the days when I can't make it to the yoga studio. It's suitable for beginners  as well. I like to mix and match the workouts depending on how much time I have and how I'm feeling. You get three different workouts in one and I Iove the core work!,1358380800,,259,3.8867924528301887

5277821,1,B0099115XW,"I love Colleen's videos that were offered through Plum TV on youtube. They became disabled once Plum TV the company went belly up. I would buy those in a heartbeat if she could offer them. I tried one of these workouts and they were just way too easy for me and they also had weird moves thrown in ( like throwing one's hands up in the air, fast) I assume that was part of the  weight loss promoting factor but not really very yoga-like. The actual yoga parts are too easy and seemingly designed for someone's grandma or someone super inactive. I ended up throwing in my own moves like down dog when she was doing cat/cows for way too long. I hope she can liberate her videos from Plum TV. They are awesome, by the ocean and challenging enough to keep me happy for a fast workout which is what i used them for inbetween more challenging routines.",1452384000,5,846,4.320754716981132

Whittle Your Middle is ok. More twists and ab work, so not much full body stretching. I find the last one to be the most challenging as Colleen goes kind of fast, so if you've never done it you might have trouble keeping up, but once you know what you're doing you'll be fine. I don't find that I feel as stretched out with this one. I find the music and Colleen's voice to be very soothing. I feel so relaxed by the time I'm done.

5277890,5,B0099115XW,"I thought I would try this DVD for some variety in my practice.  I have never purchased one of Colleen Saidman's DVD's before, but I'm glad I did.  I like that there are three 20-minute segments.  I can tailor the practice to the amount of time available; a single 20-minute workout is adequate to get in a daily practice session, but the full 60 minute practice feels like a studio class.
Keep in mind tha thte 20 minute sessions have very little time for a complete final relaxation pose, so if you feel more comfortable with a longer relaxation pose, pause the DVD and stay in the position as long as you are comfortable.  Otherwise, I like the tone of Colleen's voice; I think the cueing is suffient if you are familiar with the poses.  If you are just a beginning practitioner, I would suggest watching the DVD first to become familiar with the pace of each session and the poses.  Background music is quiet; and the scenery is peaceful.",1410134400,,942,4.511764705882353

The only thing that bothered me was that she went into the poses to fast and into the next pose before I was done doing the other pose. And also, the music was louder than her voice. The background music was calming but even if you turned the volume up you heard mostly the background music and it was hard to hear her voice. Other than that I really  like this DVD.

I can use any of the 3 to start my morning if I only have time for a quick session and I can use any of the 3 to wind down at the end of the day.  I notice I sleep better and I am much more willing to engage in other exercise if I start the day off with one of her sessions.  I just ordered another set of videos that she does.  If you are knew to yoga and want an instructor that has a relaxing effect on you, Colleen is fabulous.  I strongly recommend these for any yoga practicer, but especially for newbies like me because she gives great instruction, very easy to follow.

I really like Colleen Saidman's workouts. They are gently strenuous.  You feel good after, but not wiped out.  She is very good at describing the pose, which is nice since you can't always be facing the screen. Her voice is gentle and even though she is amazingly flexible, she does not expect us to be. This video can be viewed in sections of as an entire 1 hour workout. I really like the second workout which focuses on abs, but the rest of you gets a workout too.

The second workout is the ""whittle your middle"" one. That's the one I use on a regular basis. It's more challenging.

She goes slow. Really explains everything well. Cues breathing well. Just a little slow for me. I'd highly recommend this teacher if you're a beginner. And also this DVD if you're a beginner.",1387411200,,472,4.2444444444444445

It includes a comprehensive introduction, and 22-25 minute workouts that you can do separately or combine into one workout. I like the 'Total Flow' workout, combined with a 'Strengthening and Energizing' workout. There is also a Core focus one, and some bonus material. The setting for all of them is beautiful, the instructions clear, and the workout comprehensive. There isn't much time spent on how to modify the moves within the workout, so this won't be right for most people who are completely new to yoga. It's also not a particularly difficult workout, so if you are looking for a hardcore 'power yoga' type of workout, this isn't it. But if you've had a moderate level of experience, this will be excellent for you.",1385769600,30,908,4.980263157894737
5277952,4,B0099115XW,"I like the setting and the instructor very much.  There is not a lot of babble about breathing or reaching inside, blah, blah.  Other yoga videos I've tried spend waaay too much time talking and not enough on actually doing yoga.  I like that there are three different  sessions, each about 20 minutes, that you can do individually or together.  The one thing that I am not really  crazy about is that she moves through the poses really quickly.  For me, I like to have a little bit longer in the pose to really stretch and feel the muscle release but there is no time given for that in this video.  I have modified by staying in a pose longer, if I feel like I need/want to, and then moving on to wherever the instructor is when I am ready.  I would say that if you have never done any kind of yoga before, then this is probably not the video for you.  She does move pretty quickly and there isn't a lot of explanation on how to get into each pose.  However, if you have had some yoga experience then this should be very approachable for you.  I am not a yoga expert.  I have taken classes off and on over the last decade and found this to be a great video for me and my skill level.",1383868800,,1184,4.117903930131004

I'm fairly new to Yoga and started with Rodney Yee's AM and PM Yoga for Beginners.  The evening practice with Colleen Saidman was so relaxing and didn't leave me bored.  I wanted to move into more intense workouts, so bought this video.  It gives me the increase in exercise that I was looking for and is just as interesting and non-boring as I was hoping.  There are 3 20-minute workouts you can do separately or all together.  I just do one of them every night and hope to work up to doing all 3 of them together sometime in the future.",1372982400,3,641,4.427350427350428
5277957,3,B0099115XW,"I probably own at least 50 yoga and pilate DVDs, and this one is my least favorite.  I do like that it is divided into 3 sections (Total Body Flow, Whittle Your Middle, and Strengthen & Energize.)  I also like the beautiful background setting, and Colleen Saidman has an inspiring, dancer-like physique.

What I greatly dislike is the rushing of almost every single move.  This is definitely not meditative yoga, but I wasn't expecting a ""weight loss"" focus to be so.  Nonetheless, I did not expect each move to flow to the next move at such a hurried pace.  I did not feel an adequate stretch on 90% of the moves, and focusing on breathing was extremely difficult at the hurried pace.

Further, the moves do not always match up with the words, so if you glance at the tv to check yourself--it can be confusing.

Now, having said all this, if the actual yoga practice was challenging, I might understand sacrificing the pace for the sake of increased weight loss.  However, this was not a particularly challenging set.  Rushing the moves seemed to make it even less challenging...like you're just going through the motions.  I prefer quality over quantity, and just doing a quick spot check of each move didn't work for me.",1371254400,41,1223,4.668224299065421

5278004,5,B0099115XW,Love love love Colleens teachings!! She is so inline with the way that I want to receive the energy of yoga and listeining to her voice is so calming for me I recommend this to all my girlfriends who are just tired of the studio classes for whatever reason!!,1369785600,,258,4.285714285714286
5278005,5,B0099115XW,"Love all three work outs.  You can do one, two or all three. She moves you into and out of every position easily.  Great for any level.",1369353600,,135,3.962962962962963
5278006,3,B0099115XW,"The poses and routines are very original but just 20 minutes long. I wish I had known before buying because those don't work for me. I need at least 45 minutes.
As for the title, it is really missleading. This is not a workout designed to help to keep the weight off, she just says in the introduction that regular practice of yoga, like any other type of exercise, eventually helps to lose weight. Thank you for the information! There is no approach behind this practice to accelerate your metabolism or burn more calories.
I still think Rodney Yee or Ashley Turner are way better.",1369180800,2,582,4.552380952380952
5278007,5,B0099115XW,"This DVD contains 3. gentle workouts that are a really pleasant experience. I look forward to getting up and putting on the DVD and I then feel grounded and in my body for the rest of the day. It's not a calorie burner - you still have to eat less and do some cardio. But, somehow these routines make me happier in my body and lead me to WANT to do better for my body. That's essential motivation for weight loss. And consistent yoga practice is key- these 3 routines make it easy and pleasant to achieve that. Saidman is a great instructor.",1367798400,2,541,4.262135922330097
5278008,3,B0099115XW,The practices are rather basic and would be more suited for a beginner. This is a good addition to my Yoga DVD collection and I will use for early morning practice when my body is not quite as flexible.,1366761600,2,202,4.205128205128205
5278009,2,B0099115XW,"I was disappointed, I was hoping this was meant to help with losing weight.  This is great if you are just looking for a calming yoga practice.  I wanted some intensity and this did not deliver.",1365811200,3,194,4.361111111111111
5278010,5,B0099115XW,"I have been using Yoga DVDs for years and just ran across this one.  Colleen Saidman's practice is soothing and challenging (both, amazingly!).  I love each of the 20 minute segments equally.  At the end of each workout after over a week, I am still feeling soreness in my muscles.  Her focus on breathing is some of the best I've seen on any Yoga DVD, and the scenery itself is really soothing and energizing.  I look forward to my morning workouts now, and that is no small thing.  Nicely done.",1365379200,2,496,4.455555555555556
5278011,5,B0099115XW,"Amazing practice. There are 3 workouts on this DVD and each equally great. Colleen very skillfully was able to make it seem like a calm workout, but at the same time make you feel like you worked out. Very quickly i was able to notice difference in my mood, posture and body. Obviously, in order to see significant difference one has to do it consistently. But as far as this dvd goes, each work out is little over 20 minutes, so you can fit it in in the morning or afternoon, or anytime really. I find such workout much more effective since i rarely have the time for an hour work out and these little ones i find it to be able to squeeze them in every day. Her instructions are good, she gives you tips on how to make it work for you, too. I was so impressed with this DVD, i wanted to get more of her workouts.",1365033600,,813,4.0875
5278049,2,B0099115XW,"I've taken a women's retreat with Colleen and loved it. She is a fabulous yoga teacher and her style was vigorous without killing us. So, I thought her video would be the same. Unfortunately it's just not vigorous at all and if you want to lose weight I would think you need to work the body a bit. Unless her approach to weight loss is to calm the mind and relax (which there is argument for a relaxed mind helping stave off emotional hunger and thus would result in weight loss). I think that's what she was trying to accomplish. But, the title of the video doesn't reflect that so I felt a little ripped off. In general I love Colleen and her husbands Rodney Yee's stuff but not this time.",1364515200,4,692,4.290076335877862
5278050,5,B0099115XW,"I bought this video about two months ago and it is my favorite in my collection! The workouts are easy to follow, relaxing, and I see results. I really love the whittle the middle section- it is the best core workout that I have!",1363305600,,229,4.2272727272727275
5278051,5,B0099115XW,"My husband and I are beginners. This DVD shows the poses clearly, easily understood directions, pace is perfect with practice. Challenging until familiar with the routine. Three twenty minute sessions, each with rest.  You can do one or all. Description on Amazon is accurate.  You won't be disappointed.  I plan on sharing with my daughter and son-in-law who are experieinced.",1362700800,14,377,5.25
5278052,5,B0099115XW,"I have tried a lot of home yoga DVDs and this is one of the best I have come across!! I love the fast paced flow of poses and detailed verbal instructions. I chose ""play all"" from the disc and did all 3 practices as an hour long routine. The whittle your middle section was creative and not the same old thing every workout DVD offers. I haven't enjoyed a yoga practice this much in a long time! I can't wait to do it again! Thanks Colleen!!!",1362441600,4,442,4.091954022988506
5278053,5,B0099115XW,Clear instructions and a well-rounded practice is what you will get with this dvd. Buy it and don't wait to do it. It can be done in 20-minute segments or 1 hour. There is something for everyone on the dvd.,1361923200,2,206,4.175
5278054,4,B0099115XW,"This is a great yoga DVD and really gets the blood flowing and does generate some heat.  The setting, instructor's voice, and music are very nice and enjoyable.  The ""Strength and Energize"" segment of the DVD is really good but, I thought perhaps it would contain a few more difficult poses.  Regardless, I really enjoy doing my practice with this DVD.  I have been out of a yoga practice for almost 2 years and this was a great way to get back into it.  I highly recommend it.  Great for beginners to experts and everyone in between!",1361923200,15,534,4.453608247422681
5278055,5,B0099115XW,3 great practices on this one dvd - the flow is perfect and it is a really good workout worth the money for sure,1361836800,,112,3.7083333333333335
5278056,5,B0099115XW,"I reach for this video every day. It helps me not only with my weight but with my nervous system. I have been doing it for 2 months and I just discovered the 13 minute bonus video. wow. That is a serious workout. It is like the graduation class. Burn calories and sweat, but it is also fun and nicely paced.  It packs a heavy hit in 13 minutes. I don't recommend starting with the bonus track, but building up to it.",1361577600,3,416,4.073170731707317
5278057,5,B0099115XW,"I really liked the fact that this video was split into 3 parts.  It allows you the freedom to workout any length that is appropriate for your schedule.  Colleen's flow was the perfect speed, and it keeps you actively moving the entire time... No one move is held too long.  Anyone would be successful using this video.  I used this video in my classroom, and my students were actively engaged, most of which had never done yoga before.  I have been doing yoga for years, and I also was engaged in the exercise.  My students found the relaxation at the end very calming.  I would recommend this video to all!!",1361318400,,608,4.472727272727273
5278058,5,B0099115XW,I am enjoying this video. It feels so good to do it. The explanations and transitions are clear and easy to follow for a 66 year old trying to maintain flexibility. Thanks Colleen.,1360195200,3,180,4.484848484848484
8537786,5,B0099115XW,"As an intermediate, the level of difficulty of this DVD is just what I was hoping for. The instruction by Colleen Saidman is extremely good and each routine is well paced. I would also check out Colleen Saidman's Calorie Killer Yoga; it too is very well done.",1522972800,,259,4.531914893617022

8537789,5,B0099115XW,"I got this on a whim to try and jazz up my at home yoga practice and have ended up loving it. There are a few funny poses that if I were with other people I don't know how serious I could take the video, but on my own I've really been liking it. I'm also seeing the results that I was looking for by having a change of pace.",1518048000,,324,3.642857142857143
