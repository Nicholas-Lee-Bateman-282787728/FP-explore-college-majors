5391322,5,B00A7045I6,I am a fan of Korean comedy and dramas. I think the other reviewers just did not get it. There is sound now. I do not read or speak Korean but the closed captioning was good enough. There is reason enough to watch this movie.,1404000000,2,225,4.022222222222222
5391323,1,B00A7045I6,No idea what's going on in this movie. Totally incomprehensible. Despite impossibly beautiful girls I shut this down at 21 minutes into the fray,1384819200,,144,5.041666666666667
5391324,1,B00A7045I6,There is no sound only subtitles.  This was a horrible buy. If I could get my money back I would.,1378771200,,97,3.85
5391325,4,B00A7045I6,"Really sweet movie. If you're a fan of Korean dramas and a total romantic at heart, then you'll like this movie. It's also a definite must-see for fans of Ji HyunWoo (""MinHyuk""). All the stuff his fans love about him is in this movie. The only downside of this movie is that the audio is missing. I wanted to hear HyunWoo's voice and listen to him sing!!!",1372896000,3,355,4.313432835820896
5391326,1,B00A7045I6,"The Fly High movie portrayed on the dvd cover is not what is inside the case.  The pic shown on the cover clearly shows Korean actor/singer/model Kim Bum, yet he does not appear anywhere in the enclosed movie.  What's up???",1368835200,,223,4.55
5391347,3,B00A7045I6,Too sad for me,1441324800,,14,2.75

5391354,3,B00A7045I6,"As the pickings are so slim, I guess this would be better than nothing, but not the quality I am used to in Korean dramas. It was a nice family story and I guess it was better than I expected.",1412899200,,192,3.825
5391355,4,B00A7045I6,"very touching and humorous.  Although the ending was sad, it was well done and spared the viewer from seeing the worse.  Really good movie.",1411516800,,139,4.75
5391356,4,B00A7045I6,"Despite what others have said, the audio worked just fine for me. Subtitles worked well with just a few mistakes during the entirety of the movie.
As for the movie. It was a sweet story, definitely made me cry towards the last 30 minutes or so. Yes, the main character is a bit silly as he tries to earn the girl's affections, but that's what makes it so realistic. They are kids! I give this a 4 star rating and recommend it to others. It's almost like a Korean version of ""A Fault in Our Stars"".",1409875200,2,497,4.1875

8547466,5,B00A7045I6,"It had a perfect blend of romance, comedy and drama....Ji Hyun-Woo made me laugh, cry and  stole my heart with his brilliant performance....Lim Jung-Eun is superb as the  female lead  who has been living with an illness for several years but still sees the beauty in life",1479254400,,271,4.723404255319149
