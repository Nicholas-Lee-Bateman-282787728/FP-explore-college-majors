I originally bought it for my grandson Liam to have here at the house when he visited.  However, I've watched them many times over even when he isn't here.  These movies have instilled in both of us a whole new awareness of the majesty of our oceans.  Except for a few of the more graphic depictions of ""real-life"" predator/prey relationships which may need adult companionship for some of the younger kids, I would wholeheartedly recommend these to everyone, young and old!  An outstanding effort in every respect!",1165795200,3,619,4.80188679245283
