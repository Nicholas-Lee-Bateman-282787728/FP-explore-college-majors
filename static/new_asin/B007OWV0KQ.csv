8519934,5,B007OWV0KQ,"This is a story about teachers and artists; cultures and communities; friendship and collaborations.  It documents a group of friends as they traveled from the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia to Jomsom village in the Mustang district of western Nepal to deliver a painting by artist Jane Lillian Vance about Amchi Tsampa Ngawang Lama, a Tibetan amchi-lama-doctor and mind-healer.  Jane Vance is the first woman and first westerner granted permission to create such a piece.

A Gift for the Village is the culmination of years of friendship and collaboration between this prominent Buddhist lama and an American painter and teacher.  In the film, a large oil painting - titled Amchi -- is removed from its stretchers and escorted across the globe and is offered as a gift to a village in the western Himalayan mountains of Nepal.  The team was welcomed with an elaborate festival -- sanctioned by the Dalai Lama  -- celebrating the artist, the work and the man it honors.  A Gift for the Village documents the remarkable story of their trip -- offering unprecedented access to a vanishing tradition.

The project began in 1999 when Vance met teacher, Jenna Swann and began a travel partnership and project collaboration, resulting in their award-winning documentary, Into Nepal.  In the winter of 2000, accompanied by their friend Amchi Tsampa Ngawang Lama, Vance and Swann crossed an 18,000-foot Himalayan pass in a snowstorm during a month-long trek in Nepal's Annapurna region. It was during this trek that Tsampa, Swann, and Vance planned Tsampa's first visit to America where he would later live for 6 months at Vance's home studying and teaching together in Blacksburg, Virginia.  During these months the Buddhist lama agreed to have Jane create the Amchi portrait.  The friendship between Vance, Swann and Tsampa would soon include Tom Landon and journey of this painting would become the documentary film: A Gift for the Village.

Public Radio's Lisa Mullins narrates this story about a cultural bridge constructed over a decade between the homes of Amchi Tsampa Ngawang Lama in Nepal and Jane Lillian Vance in Virginia.  The film chronicles the bond of friendship that spans two cultures through celebration and through mourning as the American film team reeled in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech campus shootings in 2007.

The film is dedicated to the memory of Morgan Dana Harrington who, in 2009, was abducted and murdered while attending a concert at the University of Virginia.  Morgan's bright spirit and vibrant image appears in the film, as she was one of Jane's treasured students at Virginia Tech.  Harrington would have joined Vance and her team in the summer of 2010 as they traveled to share the completed film with the people of Nepal.",1336348800,3,2761,5.061810154525387
8519935,5,B007OWV0KQ,"Tom Landon and Jenna Swann present a film that provides a unique portal into Tibetan culture. Although most similar productions would simply `get by' by showcasing the life of Amchi Tsampa, the team of Landon, Swann, and artist Jane Vance take it several steps further. The connections made between Tibetan Buddhist villagers and rural Appalachian Virginians are both accurate and eye-opening. It is remarkable to think that one painting by a Virginia Tech professor could serve to unite such seemingly different cultures. I must say that after watching A Gift for the Villiage I am eager to visit the Nepalese Upper Mustang and the caring people that reside there.",1336089600,3,665,5.110091743119266
8519936,5,B007OWV0KQ,"The voyage from Blacksburg, Virginia to Nepal takes many forms and brings two worlds closer together.  Jane Vance's painting is a master piece as it captures the life of Amchi Tsampa.  The Villagers are touched by our lives here in our Mountains in Virginia.  We also feel a closeness to Tsampa and his greater family in Nepal.  Unique.  Tom Landon and Jenna Swann are to be commended for their production skills.  It is a film about much more than paintings, April 16 in Blacksburg, and life in Nepal.  It is about the human spirit that is part of us all.",1332892800,4,556,4.5
