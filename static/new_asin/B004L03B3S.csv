4399047,5,B004L03B3S,"This Brazilian drama will leave nobody indifferent. It doesn't happen everyday that we can watch such a controversial, yet interesting story.
Aluisio Abranches did a great job as a director. His picture is sublime. I watched it without taking break etc.
But there is one thing that bothered me a bit.
Maybe it is the way he led the actors and action, but his potray of brothers' love seems to be pure and natural (as if there was nobody around Thomas and Francisco who found their relationship at least ""not propriate""). Even parents don't react (well, a small talk between divorced parents doesn't count). But it's then, when mother says that very important sentence, which could be the bottom line of the whole film.
Watch yourself and find it.
Moreover, the ending itself left a little marigin of doubt. A small question mark, so visible on Thomas' face...Was it meant to be there? Did the director want to tell us something?
We will never know that.
To sum up:
Acting (both young and older actors) is magnificent, beautiful soundtrack suits the action very well. Don't miss this one!",1303776000,7,1087,4.787234042553192

(( A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY INVOLVING HALF-BROTHERS ))

- AN EXPLANATION ABOUT THIS FILM'S BEGINNING: Concerning The ""Eyes Thing"" in the film's first 2 minutes, there is a reason for the opening Black+White scene....and it has nothing to do with equipment failure....and everything to do with a newborn baby's failure (actually, unwillingness) to open his eyes. ....Until 2 weeks later, when he is shown to...and becomes aware of his older brother's presence (that's the eye-opening trigger). Let's just say about this that there is some foreshadowing here of the depth of the ""brotherly Relationship"" which is to come.

(( NOTE--Now is a good time to advise that you read a marvelous 35 year old novel by Spanish author, Agustin Gomez-Arcos, entitled ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Carnivorous-Lamb-Little-Sister-s-Classics/dp/B0044KMRCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Carnivorous Lamb (Little Sister's Classics)</a>"" (included in some ""Gay Must-Read"" recommended works). Here, you'll also find a detailing of the deep and physical love which develops between an older and younger brother. It is a beautiful read...and also begins with the ""Eyes Thing."" Perhaps Writer / Director Aluisio Abranches is, himself, a fan of this book. ))

- TIME PERIODS GIVEN US ARE 2: The brothers' early lives, ""growing closer together"" as children and young teens....Then, later on, their adult ""Relationship"", when the younger is, perhaps 20, and the older in his mid-20s or so.

- GENERAL OBSERVATIONS: It was UNexpected (and a problem for me) that so much time is devoted to ""family life"" in the film's first half.....particularly since it is problem-free (I rated film lower for this). Oh, and for those of you inclined to do the ""blame-it-on-the-Mother"" thing for the type ""Relationship"" you'll be seeing...just don't. As well, both the older brother's father (mother's divorced Ex) and the younger brother's father (mother's current) have close relationships with the boys...and with their mother (a woman who is, indeed, a lynchpin in the boys' lives). Moving on, we are given many, many scenes of the children's ""innocent"" physical closeness and touching---I can recall no shots in which they were not shown together. One scene, particularly, comes to mind: A quiet time with 3 of them relaxed on a sofa, the younger boy asleep against his brother's side and under his arm, the mother holding her eldest's hand while stating to him her love for them both....but then suddenly asking how things are going with the son (he responds as if thinking her meaning involves school). Then she corrects her question, saying she means....how are things going for himself. After receiving his answer of ""no problems,"" she continues to press, and does so by asking ""that question"" which so many sons would just as soon never came up: ""IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL ME?"" (For me it is easy to surmise that, at his then age of 14 or so, the real meaning behind her question would likely escape him....for he eventually responds in the negative). Still, the subject of this ""Closeness"" between the 2 boys comes up again and is discussed between the mother and her Ex...though no course of action to confront it is ever arrived at by any parent.

- NEVERTHELESS: Be that as it may, ""Closeness"" usually has to lead somewhere....does it not? So....following their mother's unexpected death, when the brothers are likely in their early and later 20s, respectively, IT HAPPENS. We've reached a point where we are made witness to a most unusual and sexually provocative scene. A scene in which....while alone in their home....standing before and facing one another....they begin a slow and sensual disrobing, one item at a time....each one's eyes intently locked on the other, as if caught in a spell.....until, finally, they step into each others arms. (You WON'T forget this shot...probably one of a kind). AND, don't dare push that button and go away(!)....for immediately following, and without giving you time to cool down, you'll be treated to a stunningly beautiful, bedroom lovemaking scene. One in which love, each for the other, is declared. Then, in their afterglow, we are given a mantra for this unusual love of theirs (a love which, in reality, harms no others). The younger brother states to his beloved...and us: ""I LOVE YOU BECAUSE, TO UNDERSTAND OUR LOVE, THEY'D NEED TO TURN THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN!"" ....There is little else for this viewer to say...other than there has never been a more beautiful painting of 2 men, together, than the camera gives us in this scene. (I won't even tempt you with descriptions of the bathroom scene which follows....other than to say: HOT!!).

- NOTABLE: Both adult leads are beautiful men.....well chosen for their roles. Particularly Joao Gabriel Vasconcellos, as elder brother, Francisco (who makes us ""feel"" his love and his loss).....but, also, Rafael Cardoso as the adult younger brother, Thomas, who lightens our hearts, as he does Francisco's. (The 2 young actors pictured in earlier childhood do a bang-up job, as well). /// Older stars portraying both the fathers and, especially Julia Lemmertz, as Mom, have well-known careers in their country's TV / Cinema performance areas. /// Cinematography is also praiseworthy.

- AND NOT SO NOTABLE: An apparent storyline gap of near 15 years presents a potential problem regarding the manner in which the lovemaking scene described above was set up. To me, the brothers' actions appear as if they are beginning their sexual activity for the very first time (tho I admit the possibility it's a ""ritual"" they enjoy when initiating sex). Certainly, with the closeness shown between these 2 young lads (and where it leads), it is hard to conceive that their mid- and late teen years together were not sexually active.

- FINALLY: I'll conclude here and allow you to find for yourself what the effects of a possible, long distance separation will be upon our lead characters....and what you might see their fate to be at film's conclusion.

WAIT....WAIT!  This needs to be added:  The lovemaking scenes of these brothers....even shots of just their ""Closeness""....rank with the best ever captured on film.  Even approaching the level achieved in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undertow/dp/B004KA1DGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undertow</a>"".....which I consider near ultimate.

PS--I've ""snuck"" back in here to let you know about another wonderful, little film of recent vintage.....""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-One/dp/B005GM38NI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The One</a>"".

4399049,5,B004L03B3S,"Though very controversial, I loved this movie.  I had my partner watch it as well as a straight female friend of ours.  My partner was hesitant about the theme and our straight female friend was simply curious. At the end of the movie, they had both been converted and they both loved the movie.  This movie was not released for almost 2 years due to the taboo subject matter.  I am glad that it is now being released.  The cinematography is amazing and the story line touching.

But in the end it is about the love between two people who happen in this lifetime to be half-brothers. The expression of their love is so honest, physical, deep, and real in it's expression. And as I viewed it the older brother could be seen to have perhaps had more power in their relationship (for many reasons you will see in the film) and alas, in the end, even he is able to let go of his younger sibling and encourage him to explore his life apart and experience the longing and loss of their connection because of LOVE.",1519084800,3,697,4.584

4399058,5,B004L03B3S,"A miraculously tender and gentle movie, in my opinion.  It does definitely have controversy no matter where you go. This is type of idealism not geared just for phallic pleasure.  A sensational movie with an acting cast that packed the emotional grace and an evocative paradigm.  It is not a complex movie but retains simplicity. The boys were the best choice ever for their roles.  The adult performances were top notch.

These two men grow up together and there is acknowledgement of it but from the very beginning there is more. The people around them see their closeness as a problem, for them its no big deal. From what they feel as boys becomes this all consuming love as adults. It becomes even more so when the younger man moves to train. Their need for each other, their love for each other gets stronger. There has been one other love story that has been able to blow me away like this. And they faced societal pressure and distance. Not being able to live without each other.",1511395200,,714,4.181159420289855

It's hard to make or at least watch a film with only 2 major characters, but those two pulled it off. The two half-brothers are very handsome,  but Francisco kept my attention.  His eyes, something about his eyes, just draws you in. I could see how Tom-Tom was drawn in, especially at the end. I've been on a kick to find that ""just feels right"" film & this is top 5. I tend to have a wild n fluid imagination & tend to feel like I'm a fly on the wall & by the end I'll feel ok, exhilarated, exhausted n depressed (like with ""Floating Skyscrapers""), or feel warm n fuzzy inside. I'm a firm believer in 'true love' n 'soulmates' & these actors made me believe that these 2 characters were both. The cherry on top was how the family didn't stop their progression throughout the years. Once again I come back to Francisco's eyes, they could melt steel.",1506729600,,968,4.372222222222222

4399066,5,B004L03B3S,High quality production from beginning to end. Loved the Brazil-Argentina context. Main characters are incredibly attractive.

4399067,5,B004L03B3S,"Francesco and Thomas are half-brothers. Their mother Juliette suspects early on they may have an intense, intimate bond. Yet, they grow up in a happy, loving, fun, environment. Juliette gets along beautifully with her ex-husband and current husband. Even Juliette's ex-husband wonders if the brothers are not ""too close."" He asks her, ""Don't you worry that Francesco and Thomas might someday sexualize their love?"" Her surprisingly open-minded, liberal, open-hearted response, ""I don't know what is happening between them, or what might happen between them, but I can't tell them it is wrong.""
  The loving environment is rocked by tragedies and the death of beautiful Juliette. Now, grown men, Francesco and Thomas realize nothing lasts forever-- and happiness must be seized. It is worth noting that ""nothing sexual happens"" between the brothers until they have grown into powerful and sexy adult men; making adult choices. The relationship between them is so strong that the sex is depicted as beautiful and natural.
  The life-long bond is tested when Thomas goes away to Russia to train on the Olympic swim team. The brothers exchange ""wedding rings"" as a symbol of their commitment. A heartbroken Francesco starts partying too much, a woman briefly enters the picture. But surprise! The director takes the progressive view here. This is incest love without the stupid, social stigmas. (The film takes place in Latin America/Brazil). The conflicts come from within, not outside. And life-long love WINS here! The director takes the progressive, bold ending I wish director Joshua Lim had taken in ""Godless"", his ""downer""  movie about  brotherly love. I highly recommend ""From Beginning To End"", the best true love story I've seen in a long time. In Portuguese with English subtitles.",1501286400,11,1788,5.278169014084507

I had hoped to see more of the two handsome men in the movie, who I learned are step-brothers,and was not disappointed. I would have liked to have seen more of Francisco and Thomas nude and intimate.

Unlike those who wrote negative review comments, I was not put off by the subject matter. I do not see anything wrong with step-brothers being sexually intimate. It also appeared there was unusual intimacy between the step-father Alexandre and Francisco, as in their shower-shaving scene. So what! In both cases the men were past the age of consent. Who am I that I should dare to judge what others others do willingly?

I know from personal experiences that sexual intimacy happens between immediate and distant family members; and as observed in the movie, between contemporaries of all ages. And that is fine so long as it is entered into willingly by all involved. That's life!

On the other hand, it is an entirely different matter if the sexual intimacy is forced on another unwillingly or it is by an adult with a child.",1473638400,2,1218,4.655813953488372

The music flowed perfect with the movie; it added so much to the different phases that the movie went through, both happy, and sad times.  I just finished watching the movie again, the past two nights, making it the fourth and fifth time I've seen it, and I am going through withdrawls today thinking and feeling like I was there, in Brazil, with these people and now they are gone; that is how much this movie absorbed me.  I can say so much more, but so much has been said already by other viewers.  One final note: the creator of the movie transitioned the young brothers into adult males in such a clever way.  One sene, they were in the car and on their way to Pedro's funeral, the father of the older brother, then the funeral scene took place, and the movie transitioned ahead 15 years to their mother's funeral, where they were all adults.  I thought that was very creative, because it all looked like one scene.  One commented on not enough nudity.  As much as I would always like to see more, the amount shown here was perfect.

This film is not for everybody. But, for those who ""get it"", it just goes to show how powerful love is, and that it knows no limits, even if the two people are related.

4399160,5,B004L03B3S,"Beautiful movie though it touches on a taboo subject.

I feel the story of their developing relationship when they were younger was well established long before they finally became adults in the movie.

While I feel that the adult section of the movie could have been longer, I don't agree that the end was such a bad thing. From my perspective the contention in the movie wasn't the forbidden love. At least not for the two main characters, as the love developed and lasted unconditionally and without remorse. It's not like they were shy about the love. And while the bedroom scenes had some semi rough passion, most of it was lovemaking from the standpoint of two men who were together their entire lives. Their love stems from a different place than two men who find themselves sexually attracted to each other, date and fall in love. These two brothers are literally the love of each other's lives, as aside from parents they only ever known each other.

So the struggle becomes the separation which is what I feel the movie tried to wrap up at the end. I mean this tends to be who other movies resolve. Either finding love and love lost, finding unlikely love and the resolution to get to be with that person, etc etc.

So for me the resolution was: what do you do when the person you love the most is separated from you and it's tearing you apart inside. Which though you don't know if it's a visit, or longer term, was handled.

Anyhow. Beautiful story to me, in my opinion. But I tend to love stories that are told through characters and dialogue, building on some emotional theme than a lot of subplot, and stories supporting it.",1433894400,,1639,4.5423728813559325

4399162,5,B004L03B3S,"After about 30 min or so in (and a few ""oh no's""), you completely forget that they are brothers and you are just overwhelmed by how much these two love each other.  And that is what it is, a simply beautiful love story.  Nobody ever told them they were wrong and they are happy, so what is love about?  I love that you can see others wrestling with it, particularly the mom, but by the end those who know see these two have a bond that others can only dream about.  And where did it come from?  Being in a loving household with two parents who are obviously in love.  So the sons did the same.  I will say I expected more of a ""problem"" to arise to challenge them, but I was satisfied at the end.  It is just a beautiful, happy film.",1431907200,,733,4.041666666666667

The main leads did their parts convincingly...which after awhile was nice, I question if real world could understand this type of love or the parents as they watched it developing. Knowing that your children have what is arguably an unnatural love (incestuous), what was the solution.  The love is engrossing and richly displayed by the cast, its painful (not violent) to watch the separation scenes, and you wonder if these to will survive the worlds standards of love (gay and non gay). It.would've been nice to see a different ending, beyond reuniting but a happier ever after (a wedding), something cliche but sappy.
Great movie whether you are gay or straight,  if you're open in heart you will no doubt be satisfied with thus story. No graphic sexual scene, more sensual (great way to go director), brief nudity (not overboard) tastefully done...an overall good film.

4399203,5,B004L03B3S,"Before i start my review lets get the giant elephant in the room out of the way.

Yes this film is about two biological half brothers who fall in love with each other beyond the familial realm.

Ok now that the Elephant is taken care of let me explain why this is a very good film.

The title of the film really seems to be suggestive ""From beginning to End"" and i interpret it as ""Watch this film from beginning to end in order to understand and see the beauty in their love for each other"". I am a critical thinker and i know history, so anyone who snubs their nose at this because of the portrayal of incest is lacking in education.

These two brothers are close from the very beginning and that closeness develops into an adult relationship that is sexualized. The two brothers present a deep rooted genuine love that trumps most relationships given the familial love aspect as well. I saw these two brothers as two adults who are too afraid to have conditional love (which is what all relationships outside of family are). You have to almost be envious of them and that they will actually always love each other instead of those lies we adults tell at the altar.

I actually fell in love with the mother in the film as she was beautiful and just emanated such a genuine motherly quality. She senses that the brothers would probably become romantic, but i think she was accepting that its not necessarily a horrendous incestual deviant thing, but a unique bond these two will share for their entire mortal lives.

This film took a taboo thing and made you almost envious of it in my opinion. Who does not want a true unconditional love from their romantic partner? Watch this film with an open mind and just pay attention to the details and you'll see this film was not some attempt to target a steamy sexual fantasy that some have or just to shock for the sake of shocking.",1420156800,,1878,4.444767441860465

4399208,3,B004L03B3S,The writers did go the mile to build the main characters.  The boyhood bond was established.  I think the scene when the relationship goes full blown was just a bit too premeditated so it kind of was a little too dramatic and grandiose.  This  kind of ruined the credibility in my opinion.  It is great to be out and proud but when there is absolutely NO struggle with a sexual orientation that is societal taboo things kind of become surreal and alternate reality-like.  I admit after the scene I kind of did not continue watching with the intention of picking up at a later time.  It was just a little too unrealistic at that moment.  But again the ground-laying and establishing of the  main character's bond was fine.,1417305600,,721,4.5703125

But the remarkable thing about this extraordinary love story is that without being prurient, the two men, and you, almost forget that they are gay and that they are brothers and they become simply, two people in love. The setting and people are beautiful, as is Brazil and Brazilians(go there sometime, it is very true). And the men live privileged lives in a sumptuous cocoon. The film starts out with the birth of the youngest, Thomas. He does not open his eyes for a month and when he does the first thing he looks into is his five year old brother Francisco's eyes. The two become inseparable, two sides of the same coin. They are so close that it raises the eyebrows of several adults including their mother who seems to know and accept what might come of an affection so intense. But they are still all innocence. The thing that seems abrupt is how they go instantly from children to adults disrobing for each other seemingly moments after their mother's funeral. But this too makes sense. For to portray any sexual tension between minors would of course be wrong and the filmmaker seems to be very wary of being needlessly salacious. They finally come to be separated and it is painful, but don't despair there is a touching and beautiful ending. One can easily fill in the blanks and see these men growing old together, only permanently separated by death.

This is the first gay film I've seen that has real substance even though its storyfraternal love that becomes fully actualizedseems utter fantasy. That substance is love: love between and among all the characters is beautifully and convincingly expressed throughout the film.

Never does the film resort to stereotypes. Never do sexual acts become the center of attention: sex is never overtly displayed, so what happens is left to the viewer's imagination. The two men are engaged with each other, engaged with those around them, and engaged with life. They laugh, they enjoy, they face temptation, endure separation. They learn. They grow. And it becomes clear that theirs is a durable bond, a bond present essentially from their birth. That alone generates an interesting question about what we bring with us when we come into this life.

4399273,4,B004L03B3S,"This is a visually beautiful film, handsome rich people in a Latin American paradise, where the love affair between two brothers is explored.  However, these two young striking men encounter only minimal tension or conflict in their priviledged lives and so the film could best be described as an incestuous love affair under the utmost conditions of acceptance, priviledge, support.  So, I was left with trying to figure out what could have been the intent of the director in making this film where the primary premise of an erotic love between brothers takes place under the most ideal conditions. Was the subject matter considered to be so taboo that it had to be presented in the very best of circumstances?  Actually, i think the film could have been strengthened had these two young men experienced more conflict, more hardship, more challenges and yet have had their love endure.

The premise that siblings have such intimacy as children that as gay adults they eroticise each other is worthy of exploration.  Yet the young men did not find anything wrong with their relationships, showing intimacy in public, even in front of Tom Tom's swimming coach and in front of Tom Tom's natural father and Francisco's step-father. I found the acting to be well done with a great performance by the actress that plays the role of the mother of the two boys. The settings in the wealthy homes of Rio Brazil are beautiful. I just wish their love had been more realistically tested by the hardships that ordinary people experience in their lives.",1388102400,,1540,4.885057471264368

The two men who play the brothers are absolutely gorgeous [Tomas looked liked he was the model for the David statue and the actor who played the other brother looked like the South American version of Bradley Cooper], although I wish they looked more similar to make their relationship more believable. Otherwise, at times I felt that I was looking at two, unrelated gay men being together. I was also a little disappointed that the actual relationship wasn't explored more: how did the sexual relationship begin, why they were so drawn to each other, character development, etc. What sort of conflict would arise between the parents when they learned of their sons' unusual relationship? The background music in some of the tender scenes was a bit too sappy for me, but it still affected me. Overall, I would recommend this film; although to which market group I'm not absolutely sure.

Perhaps it was a sum of it all. I found myself mesmerized, seduced even, by the movie. I watched it twice and then, kept on going back to slices of it, finding new angles to catch  and keep my interest.

4399288,3,B004L03B3S,"On the one hand the topic (the boundless love between two half-brothers in modern-day Brasil) has been carefully chosen and treated with a marvellous lightness of touch. Making the incest a non issue was a deliberate choice just as much as the well-to-do family setting which allows the viewer to concentrate entirely on the love story.
On the other hand direction and script do not keep their promise: they are inadequate and fail to convey the enormous emotional potential.

Capable actors manage to counterbalance the film's flaws somewhat: Jlia Lemmertz in particular is a mother whose love for her family knows no limit; Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos as Francisco, the elder brother, brightens every scene he is in with his wonderful, vulnerable smiles.

The end result is surely worth viewing but if some scenes stick to the viewer's memory is just because of the charming attractiveness of its young protagonists.",1380326400,2,915,5.134228187919463

4399290,4,B004L03B3S,"The main idea of this Brazilian movie (with subtitles), reminded me of a superb book called ""The Carnivorous Lamb"", by Augustin Gomez-Arcos, the Spanish writer who wrote in French in the 70 & 80s, where the younger brother had an infatuation over his older brother from the day he was born! While the film uses the same idea of a love affair between two brothers, the book had a much more surreal and supernatural setting for the incest, making it more convincing and plausible. The beginning of the movie focuses too much, with no apparent reason, on the childhood of the two brothers, taking almost  of the time. There is practically no plot: after we discover that the handsome two brothers are now lovers, with some beautiful and erotic scenes, we are told that the younger (a champion swimmer), will leave, alone, for Moscow for 3 years to follow rigorous training.  Expected (almost clich), scenes of longing, suffering, exchange of affectionate words over the internet, etc., follow. The older brother tries to find solace in a disco, with an eye on the handsome DJ, but surprisingly, illogically, and unconvincingly, he ends up on a couch with a woman!!! Fortunately, nothing happens and the woman leaves!

The two actors are very charming and natural. Their affection looks genuine and unpretentious, which they exchange over many nicely shot scenes.  However, there are many details which are week, illogical, or at least unconvincing:
- The father dies (why?), and the mother remarries another man who is charming, loving, and understanding (why couldn't this be the father?). Then the mother dies, and the stepfather leaves the family house to the two brothers! (why?)
- The house is beautiful and big, with a swimming pool, etc. Since none of the brothers seem to have a regular job, how did they afford the big house??
- At one point, the older brother says he is too busy, and when asked doing what? He answers: ""Partying""!! If so, why didn't he leave with his brother/lover to Moscow??
Having read some raving reviews of the movie, my expectations were high, and therefore I was a bit disappointed, especially that it could have been a much better movie if more attention had been given to the story and its content.",1378944000,,2232,4.850393700787402

4399309,5,B004L03B3S,"As I get older, watch my daughter grow up, watch the world transform yet remain ever the same, I find myself becoming more tolerant of some things and less of others.  I have very little patience with ignorant people--you know, the ones who can't identify the Vice President or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court but can tell you who a Kardashian is in an instant.  I question what I was told as a child was ""normal"" because I've come to find that ""normal"" is a subjective thing.  And I find many things to be acceptable to me now that weren't supposed to be all those years ago.

""From Beginning to End"" is a thought-provoking film.  It is beautifully filmed, with natural and artificial light illuminating the screen and all the lovely actors upon it.  As other people have said, the narrative has a fairytale quality to it, with all the characters portrayed as good and kind people.  In fact, there is very little conflict between any of the characters here.  They are content.  And accepting, it seems, because the heart of this story is about two half-brothers who share a passionate, sexual, loving relationship that nobody in the film blinks twice about.  From their parents, to their swim coach, to a female acquaintance from a night club, the viewer can sense that these people are all aware of the controversial bond between the brothers, but leave it be, perhaps because they know their interference won't change it, or because they realize the relationship actually isn't any of their business and is hurting no one.

And THAT'S how I ended up feeling about Francisco and Tomas.  I found myself accepting of this taboo relationship because I felt their love so STRONGLY, because they were hurting no one, and because unlike brother/sister incest, there was no possibility of procreation.  I don't know.  The who thing just did NOT bother me.  And as for the gay thing?  So what.  I'm so far past that.  You can't help who you are sexually attracted to or who you fall in love with.  As long as you are consenting adults, it's nobody's business but your own.  Love is a gift, after all.  True unconditional love is far more rare than we realize.  That's what Tomas explains in the movie.  As the narrator, he let's us know that when a certain character dies, he and Francisco realize that life is fleeting so to deny their chance at love would be the wrong choice.  They were meant to be together.  Soul mates if ever there were ones.

I really enjoyed this movie.  Likely because the two male leads were combustible on screen.  I mean, seriously scorching.  Their chemistry was so amazing, I never once thought they were acting.  They felt real and genuine together.  And I fell in love with them as they fell in love with each other.  When an event separates them, and you watch Francisco, especially, falling apart over his longing for Tomas, all I could do was hope that they'd find a way back together before he emotionally imploded.

4399313,4,B004L03B3S,"The movie is pretty mellow for a gay-themed / brotherly 'love' film, which tempts one to believe it'll be very controversial. However, the directors and writers mostly steer clear of the ""what will others think"" and really even the ""gay"" tension, which gives the film lots of room for character development. Although the film is definitely about two men, and there eventually is a sexual relationship, I can say with certainty, this film's focus is not on being gay. It actually transcends sexual orientation very skillfully. The brothers are almost never apart (until they are about 22 and 28 respectively) until the younger gets an invitation to Russia for swim training. This sets the pendulum swinging: is this a phase for them, or are they determined to be together for 'life'?

I gave it four stars instead of five because, after working up a real tension with one of the parents who was concerned about the relationship, instead of confronting it, the writers chose to make it disappear entirely by ""offing"" a character.",1370044800,2,1027,4.936416184971098

4399341,1,B004L03B3S,"This is not so much a movie as a diary or blog. It's certainly not porn, but it's not a movie either.

And first up, do be warned, almost nothing happens. There's NO plot development as such, just long lingering scenes that all last way beyond their potential for any interest. I was shouting ""CUT"" about halfway through every take.
It's almost as though the director thought every inch of film he shot was just so wonderfully artistic that nothing could ever be edited, and we are subjected to the lot. There's even a weird segment where he overuses a new programme he's apparently just discovered that allows characters to ""apparate"" about the room with blurry effects. It has no meaning at all, it's just there because it is.

The premise? Two half brothers grow up together, fall in love, have sex and there's a brief separation.
THAT'S IT!
Now if that's supposed to make us all reel about, dizzied with the shock of a semi-incestuous relationship, it's simply not enough!
Being half-brothers NEVER appears to worry them, so why should anyone else care? Even the viewer?

Almost half the movie is taken up with the two boy's childhood, it which great and interminable pains are taken to ensure we see that they grew up with happy parents, in a loving environment, in luxurious surroundings, and were not subjected to abuse of any kind. This takes hours and you lose interest long before it's shown, re-shown,then underlined and reinforced about twenty times. The kids act OK, but enough is enough.
Has anyone ever heard of editing? NOTHING happens, repeat nothing; ...other than the domestic bliss of what is little more than gemtlich home movies and childhood ""happy snaps"". We get the damn picture! We got it after the first five minutes already!

After what seems like hours, finally Mum dies, .....but in what must be an editing blunder, or what was supposed to be some sort of artistic ""imaginationing"" by the director, she inexplicable re-appears in full flesh to swim languidly with the two older boys much later. Why? How? It's just never explained how she manages this resurrection. (Note to the continuity-person, .....DO take note of just what swimwear the blokes have on between their takes please!)

The actors who play the brothers as adults are certainly good-looking enough,....although both have been waxed to within bare millimetres of a complete flaying.
They have sex in oh-so-artistically arranged positions, but communicating all the while in corny Hallmark Greeting Card quotes and sound grabs! This is truly embarrassing rather than romantic! People, ...(and certainly not men), do not talk like this.
The two actors can barely keep straight(ha!)faces as they are asked to deliver such flowery lines to each other. Hell, I couldn't stop laughing myself! Could they not find someone who can at least write realistic dialogue?
Mention must also be made here of THE most overly sentimental soundtrack I've ever heard, ..full of constant tinkly ""romantic"" piano and violins that play ALL the damn time as the camera lingers over everything and anything.
This can only be a highly irritating attempt to convey that the story is oh-so-deep, but you soon realise it's nothing of the sort.

The movie also suffers from the taboo on showing the most evident and prominent sign of male sexual excitement. (Ahem!)
No amount of breathless and passionate exchanges of saliva, together with naked writhings, rubbings and moaning are convincing, when to the sharp-eyed it's plainly obvious that neither of the blokes are in fact sexually aroused where it counts at all!
There is one brief and rather coy attempt to portray online sex, but again, it's probably going to pass over most viewers heads as to what is supposed to actually be going on.

The main problem here is we are meant to feel sorry, or empathise with two highly privileged and wealthy young men, who have lived in cosseted luxury all their lives, (their designer family home they inherit for nothing overlooks Sugar Loaf in Rio if you don't mind!), they have never had any hardship in their life, both have good looks and perfect health, one is an Olympic standard swimmer, the other had no trouble whatsoever becoming a doctor; neither are subjected to any discrimination or disapproval at all; (either for their sexuality or semi-incest), neither have AIDS; and the hardest thing they have ever had to face in their lives is separation for a while as one goes off to train in Russia! (Even that's not for ever.)
That's their ONLY problem in life! I kid you not.
Now why Mr. Rich Doctor doesn't simply go with his lover from the very start is beyond me, ....and that simple solution would have saved reels of over-agonising angst and nonsense there and then.
Then, ...much, MUCH later, the BIG reveal at the very end, ....SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER, ....is that HE DOES! Tah-Dah!!!
Bet you never saw THAT coming! (Rolls eyes!)

This ""movie"" is just so ultimately unsatisfying. It has no real substance whatsoever.
You keep expecting at least something of interest to happen, (even a car accident?)...but it NEVER does! Endlessly watching two pretty boys go through the motions, while initially nice enough, soon wears thin because it's just not enough to sustain a whole damn movie.
That plus the fact neither of these over-indulged, over-gifted little rich boys ever manages to evoke our sympathy in any way. Envy perhaps, ...but they've already got everything possible anyone could want, even each other, so what the hell are they mooning and moping about for?
Get on with it, enjoy your wonderful lives.
We should all be so lucky!

The transitions between scenes (blank screens) are unsophisticated, and a little jarring.  The cinematography is excellent.

The two main characters are brothers--not ""step"" brothers as some of the publicity notes have tried to obscure it. They share a mother, and they're passionately in love. They even roll around naked on camera, which is mind-bogglingly taboo while also being really, really hot. Both the actors are stunning to look at.

In a very non-American sexuality, there's no evidence that they're ""gay."" One is even clearly attracted to women. But they're in love, erotically, and they are as attached as two lovers can be.

This Brazilian film offers something refreshingly different than what I'm used to, and what I'm used to has soured me on love stories, particularly LGBTQ ones. There's no melodramatic scene in which they have to confess their taboo love in the face of judgment. There's no social, legal, or mortal punishment for their ""transgression.""

I also wondered how likely it would be that two brothers could fall in love and move out of the traditional brother-to-brother relationship.

Except for the parents the boys lost, the love story wasn't a tragedy.  That was most refreshing.  That and the fact neither of the lovers dies, as I was expecting from the title and the cemetery references towards the middle of the film.

It was a story delicately told, despite the potentially thorny subject matter.  The story could have taken dark and didactic turns, but stayed focused on the lives and love of Franciso and Thomas.  It has a bit of a fantastical quality to it, as others have described, but that didn't take away from the experience.  Nor did the concerned and fretful looks and hand-wringing from the parents.

4399378,5,B004L03B3S,"Have you noticed they are very close? This wonderful film is about the extraordinary love between two half-brothers. A love which seems a bit over the top for even their family who fear that one day these two young boys will begin sexualizing their relationship with each other. Francisco, the older of the two, is very protective of his younger sibling Thomas. Thomas in turn, idolizes his big brother/hero. They are virtually inseperable, although too young to understand their feelings may get a bit more confusing over time.

Notable quotes from the film, at least for me seem to come more from Thomas, whose display of his young ability to count exhibits itself through his remark: "" one weinie plus one weinie equals a little weinie and a big wieinie"". The film is tastefully done with no child nudity, even in the bathtub they are wearing swim suits, and not until they are both grown is there any display whatsoever of nudity. Even then, only brief moments of partial nudity.

It is a poignant look at love, tenderness, affection and incredible bonding. The kind which might one day lead to a sexual manifestation, but is certainly not created through such a relationship. It is created only in their hearts. After the death of their mother and Francisco's father, Thomas' father feels he should move on and leave these two to live their lives as they choose, never too far away to offer his support to both. Strong familial bonds throughout lend support to the theme of the film.

As adults the committed love of these brothers is tested, as Thomas, true to his young words that he will one day swim as well as his brother, is invited to train for the Olympics, but must relocate to Russia for three years. I won't tell you how the film ends, but I will tell you that it makes sense and when it's over, you feel you got some kind of ending that you deserved for investing one hour and 40 minites of your life waiting for. The only slow moments are really near the end as it might spend a bit too much time with Francisco's search for a way to cope without Thomas in his life for the very first time.

The film is set in beautiful Brazil, in Portuguese with English subtitles. AS with any foreign film, the subtitles can pass rather fast at times and be difficult to keep up as you would prefer. The acting is SUPERB all the way from the young boys who will knock your socks off, to the handsome young men who take the plot to completion. Sound and picture quality is also excellent, and I must admit that this film far exceeded my expectations.

I wasn't sure about this one, but as it turns out, very much worth while, the best ""feel good"" movie I've seen in a long long time. The storyline is believable, the acting is effortless and realistic. I immediately wanted to watch the whole thing again as soon as it was over. I didn't want it to end. I HIGHLY recommend this film. You will be greatly surprised how well done it is and I highly doubt the theme of this incestuous relationship will bother you in the slightest.",1353110400,4,3031,4.493647912885662
4399379,4,B004L03B3S,"The lovers are half-brothers growing up with their mother and her second husband, the father of the younger brother.  When her visiting first husband wonders if the boys are too close, mother thinks their boyish affection is just fine.  The elder father passes away;  ten years later, the mother dies as well.  The boys (now grown) take each other sexually it seems just as they return from her funeral.  Their love for each other keeps her alive within each of them; she even appears with them as a loving ghost in a fantasy sequence.
A Freudian would point out that their homosexual love is an acceptable sublimation for excessive mother-son intimacy, especially when it neutralizes any mortal rivalry between the boys for their mother's love.  That they are not boy-girl and not full biological brothers reduces the horror of their incest to tolerable levels, and allows an open minded viewer to rejoice for their happy lives together.",1353110400,,938,4.942675159235669

But a good director has to be mindful of his audience and its needs. The film was 96 minutes: of that the first 33 are wasted on the gigglings and pranks of the half-brothers when they were little (6 and 12 respectively). A two minute voiceover could have dispensed with this waste of time and moved the narrative forward. Then there is the incessant piano music, pleasant at first but distracting soon after. Rafael Cardoso (Thoms) has a pure and lyrical beauty and a beautiful set of glutes. The guy who plays his brother is so-so.

It would have been better to have more time between the two grownup brothers, but a considerable amount of time is wasted when Thoms goes off to Russia to train for the Olympics (3 years!). It would have been nice to have more revealing conversations between the brothers, and as a gay film, some erotic sex would have been a definite perk. Hope to see more of Mr. Cardoso. One would have to assume that the director is a not-well-read beginner. About 15 minutes of gorgeous screen time, less than a sixth of the running time. Too bad.",1350518400,,1192,4.493087557603687

The crux of the story-line, for me, is when the elder boy's Argentinian father shows up and relates how he feels the boys are too physically intimate and asks his ex-wife to intervene. In response, she simply replies : ""We mustn't tell them that what they're feeling towards each other is wrong"". If loving someone is wrong, what else on this earth could be right?

This is was crucial and overlooked as far as the story line goes, because these were the only two people that could have interdicted this tragic and heartbreaking love story. Otherwise, it was visually pleasant, some of the music was good, and it turned me on to Hilda Hilst(which was the biggest gift for me).",1343520000,,517,4.51063829787234
4399397,4,B004L03B3S,"This movie is absolutely gorgeous. Very highly recommended for anyone with an open mind.

I'll admit that it's true this film is light on conflict and leaves some aspects unexplored. For example, it sort of glosses over why the boys got into the fight at school that caused a pretty serious injury. Was it because other kids at school were uncomfortable with their closeness? That's one of many parts that I wish they had expanded on. However, the lack of detailed plotting is made up for with gorgeous cinematography, beautiful theme music, and lots of long quiet sequences full of the most passionate embracing I've ever seen on film.

As other people have pointed out, the actors are completely believable while portraying this deep lifelong love. I was even impressed with the child actors, whose casual touches and adoring gazes and gentle caresses were perfect mirrors of the mannerisms the older actors later possessed.

The scene that begins at the 43:22 mark is one of my favorite scenes in movie history. Not many movies successfully pull off declarations of love without being too cliche or cloying. To me, the scene of them in bed asking each other ""Why do you love me?"" was a perfect mix of tender, playful, and philosophical. It highlights the extremely codependent nature of their relationship without making it seem unhealthy. They give each other exactly what they need, and they don't care that no one else would understand it. Fascinating dynamic. Powerfully moving.

If I had to summarize this film in a few words, I would say: Lovely, erotic, sweet, and memorable.",1342915200,3,1585,4.925093632958801

Not so much.

Honestly, they could've been next door neighbors with how no one ever confronts them about their relationship. I'm not even kidding. They act as if it's entirely normal in public and not one person asks them about it or ever and they never seem to feel like there's anything wrong with it, which is why I'm not entirely sure why it matters that they're related. And even when the one father and the mother worry about it, neither or them ever approach the kids about it so it's all pretty much a wasted opportunity in the conflict and character development department. Neither character really overcomes anything or changes because they're fine with their relationship in the beginning and fine with it by the end.

Game of Thrones handles an incestuous relationship ten million times more interestingly than this does.

Also, everyone seems to think their chemistry is great but I completely disagree. I've seen better chemistry between actors playing gay characters on soap operas. These guys are kind of awkward to watch.",1341792000,11,1145,4.917098445595855

4399402,5,B004L03B3S,"From Beginning to End is not at all a modern American movie, it's an ambitious and beautiful foreign film, Ingmar Bergman-esque in its pacing, lighting, attention to detail, and full-body acting. Light to Bergman's dark, still it explores an almost-Greek myth of two brothers who become two halves of one person.

The parents worry about it, then accept it. With a minimum of dialogue, the characters convey their complex emotions in long close-ups, moments where you absorb their emotion until you feel what the characters themselves are feeling. The movie requires you to participate in the characters' emotions, rather than just feeding you plot.

The look is slightly artificial and stylized, beautifully lit, with everything beautifully displayed: the water, the clothes, the interiors, the bodies. Some scenes are breathtakingly erotic, again with a Bergman-esque feel. Such as the scene when the brothers are finally alone as adults after their mother's funeral. They disrobe one piece at a time turn-by-turn, facing each other, leaving no question that they are both choosing to take the next, socially out-of-bounds, step.

The film has a surprisingly light touch where it would be easy to be heavy. The scene where the dead mother appears to join the adult brothers at the beach is heart-wrenching as you begin to absorb the implications, but is also very sweet and natural.

I expected this to be more of a gay film, but From Beginning to End transcends the genre completely, despite the beautifully erotic scenes between the lovers. It is simply an excellent film in the tradition of Ingmar Bergman. A film that strikes you with its restrained (and not-so-restrained) passion, its intelligence, and a sophisticated sensibility that stirs things up but leave you to find your own answers. It's not a particularly comfortable film, and that is a large part of its beauty: you really aren't quite sure what to think about what you've seen. But you will be glad that you have seen it.",1340668800,3,1992,5.064024390243903

I never grew up with a brother, so maybe that is why I did not get the eww factor that everyone else initially experienced when watching this film. Honestly I found that it pushed a boundary that needs to be pushed tastefully. I love how the characters were shown as children and how it blossomed into the deep love that they have for one another as adults. After I watched this movie I had the immediate feeling of wow that was hot but kind of wrong, but then I thought some more and really dove into the subject matter. Except for social norms and acceptance what is wrong with the scenario that played out in the film. Two consenting adults who grew up together became best friends as children and eventually discovered that that they loved each other, they just happen to be related. I think in the synopsis offered of the film by Amazon that the key idea of being from stable ordinary loving family is important because that is the first thing that nay sayers point to when the concept of incest and homosexuality come up. 1) The family is unstable and unhealthy, and 2) there was probably child abuse going on that turned these men onto each other. That is just the preconceived notions that I think the director and the writers wanted to fight when producing this movie. I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone who has an open mind and ability to think logically (without religious or social pressures)about the overall message behind the film, that you sometimes cannot choose who you love and if you could why wouldn't you choose someone that you have known From Beginning to End.",1339891200,3,1663,4.583892617449664

First, the acting -- especially the boys playing the brothers when they were young -- was amazing. They really portrayed an extraordinary, authentic and carefree love for each other, that it made everyone around them aware of the relative lack in their relationships. And this was long before adulthood, when their expression evolved to include sex. Around them, the parents and the housekeeper all created a believable, yet incredibly rare environment of unconditional love for these two boys -- even as they worried about what the relationship could become in the future.

The thing that is most ""sensational"" about this story is the incest element. But reducing their relationship down to this would be like describing Steve Jobs as a filmmaker -- true, but by no means sufficient. It was not until after the boys were adults, and their world changed dramatically with the death of their mother, that they felt the liberation to add the sexual expression of love to a relationship that had already been emotionally exclusive their entire lives. The mother's death affected every family member in different ways, but for the boys, it made obvious what had always been there for each other -- according to the narrator, both love and longing.

But what stayed with me the most was how the mother and the father of the younger brother loved their kids no matter what. It made me think of Christian parents who cannot accept that their kids are gay. They could learn a tremendous amount from these parents. And so could many of us.

When I first saw the sexual aspect of their relationship developing, I'm embarrassed to admit that I felt uncomfortable. Until I realized that these guys were aware that no one could truly understand what they had with each other; nor did they need that affirmation. Nor, had they ever. I actually experienced growth during the movie: Later, when it looked like one of them was exploring another relationship (with a woman, no less), I found myself saddened by it -- knowing that there was no way this new relationship could ever compare with over 20 years of emotional intimacy they'd had with each other.

4399416,5,B004L03B3S,"FROM BEGINNING TO END (Do Comeo ao Fim) is the work of writer/director Aluzio Abranches who was born and raised in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He graduated in Economics before going to the London International Film School, in 1983. His first feature-film, 'Um Copo de Clera' (1999) was acclaimed in several international film festivals. In 2002 his second feature-film, As trs Marias (The Three Marias) also was selected to various festivals abroad. His latest movie, 'Do Comeo ao Fim' (From Beginning to End) tells a story about two male half-brothers who fall in love. The movie caused tremendous controversy as some people loved the delicate relationship between them and others who were outraged by the suggestion of incest. Nevertheless, it is undeniable it was groundbreaking for the homosexual Brazilian cinematography, being selected to over 25 international film festivals, many of them dedicated to the gay pride and film production.

Though the feelings of viewers continues to be quite mixed, hopefully in time the film as an art work will be better appreciated.  It is an exquisite study of family in a different light than any other film has probed.  Julieta (Jlia Lemmertz) is currently married to Alexandre (Fbio Assuno) and they have a child Thoms who according to the narrator - the half brother Francisco from Julieta's previous marriage to Pedro (Jean Pierre Noher) - was born with his eyes closed and kept them closed except for looking at his new brother.  Into this loving atmosphere the two brothers are close, enjoying each other's company in play and adventures and proximity. Francisco as a child is played by Lucas Cotrim and Thoms as a child is played by Gabriel Kaufmann. Thoms idolizes his big brother and Francisco looks to Thoms for secure love.  The boys visit Pedro (Francisco's father) in Buenos Aires at Christmas and Pedro discusses with Julieta that he is concerned that the boys are too close, a fact that Julieta acknowledges but assures Pedro that this is normal in boys their age. At home in Rio de Janeiro Alexandre poses the same concern, but the two young boys are so happy and successful in school and sports that the subject is dropped.  Pedro dies, then Julieta dies, and the two now grown young lads have only their shared father Alexandre to parent them. As young very handsome, athletic men Francisco (now played by Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos) and Thoms ( Rafael Cardosa) are left alone in their home and their relationship deepens into a physical one. The lads deeply love each other and their physical love is as wondrously portrayed as their love as half brothers.  They exchange rings. They both are dedicated swimmers, but Thoms is better and is offer to go to Russia to train for the Olympics.  The idea of separation deeply troubles them both, but Francisco's love for Thoms sees the importance to his brothers career and off Thoms goes to Russia.  While the lads are separated they yearn for each other: Francisco attempts to assuage his longing with a young girl but his commitment to Thoms is stronger.  The film ends in a statement of commitment and love between these two extraordinary men.

The physical aspects of the relationship are beautifully captured in the sensitive cinematography by Ueli Steiger: the acts are passionate but visually subtle.  The musical score by Andr Abujamra adds another realm of power to the story's character.  Each of the actors in the film is excellent. It is rare that broken family stories have been shared with such grace and delicacy. And both Vasconcellos and Cardoso seem to have a fine career ahead of them.

FROM BEGINNING TO END should not be labeled as a gay film even though it allows the viewer to see the power of same sex relationships in a beautifully described new light.  This is, simply, a fine film and Aluzio Abranches deserves kudos for his accomplishment.  Grady Harp, April 12",1333670400,4,3900,4.9132420091324205
4399417,5,B004L03B3S,"FROM BEGINNING TO END (Do Comeo ao Fim) is the work of writer/director Aluzio Abranches who was born and raised in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He graduated in Economics before going to the London International Film School, in 1983. His first feature-film, 'Um Copo de C&oacute;lera' (1999) was acclaimed in several international film festivals. In 2002 his second feature-film, As trs Marias (The Three Marias) also was selected to various festivals abroad. His latest movie, 'Do Comeo ao Fim' (From Beginning to End) tells a story about two male half-brothers who fall in love. The movie caused tremendous controversy as some people loved the delicate relationship between them and others who were outraged by the suggestion of incest. Nevertheless, it is undeniable it was groundbreaking for the homosexual Brazilian cinematography, being selected to over 25 international film festivals, many of them dedicated to the gay pride and film production.

Though the feelings of viewers continues to be quite mixed, hopefully in time the film as an art work will be better appreciated.  It is an exquisite study of family in a different light than any other film has probed.  Julieta (J&uacute;lia Lemmertz) is currently married to Alexandre (F&aacute;bio Assuno) and they have a child Thom&aacute;s who according to the narrator - the half brother Francisco from Julieta's pervious marriage to Pedro (Jean Pierre Noher) - was born with his eyes closed and kept them closed except for looking at his new brother.  Into this loving atmosphere the two brothers are close, enjoying each other's company in play and adventures and proximity. Francisco as a child is played by Lucas Cotrim and Thom&aacute;s as a child is played by Gabriel Kaufmann.

4399423,5,B004L03B3S,"From Beginning to End is hyped as ""controversial"" because the relationship that is portrayed is between two males who are half-brothers, the suggestion being, of course, that their relationship is incestuous.  How silly! The incest taboo in Western society and elsewhere was established to prevent a male and female who are closely related from having sexual intercourse and giving birth to a child who often is born retarded or suffers from other physical or mental defects.  That taboo makes sense in human society.  BUT sexual relations between two males results in no offspring.  Intercourse produces no human beings.  Therefore to compare sexual relations between two related males to that of a related male and female makes no biological or logical sense.

What is beautiful about this movie is the love between these two half-brothers from the time when they were growing up through their life as young, sexual adults.  The earlier relationship was, of course, not sexual but one of tender closeness, protectiveness, and love.  Later, after they were older the relationship evolved naturally into a sexual one that was an expression of both tender love and protectiveness that was a natural part of their normal social and professional lives.  What, I ask, could be more satisfying for two people?

Its storyline, the script, the acting in this movie are all superb. It certainly surpasses most American movies classified as gay. To dismiss it as a movie about incest reflects ignorant prejudice.

I understand that (many/most?) there is a often a strong sexual element when two young men enter a relationship, but I would have appreciated more romanticism/romantic dialogue, eventhough there was some. Of course, being a european film, there was an element of ""european flair"" which invariably occurs. There was an opportunity for this movie to be a ""classic"" but it was a good movie, overall.

It wasn't sensationalized; it developed along a natural consequence of two boys developing a love for each other that transcended the norms of the social environment. The fault I find with it is the gaps in the storyline It goes from the suspicions of their parents, re: their bonding to each other, to their denouement after their biological parents die. There is nothing known about their life from preadolescents to mature men! We don[t find out if they explored their sexuality, as teenagers (apparently not) and know nothing of their ambitions in life whether or not they pursue their careers (only made known, in Francisco's case, near the end of the movie) and what occupations are they in (if any--again only learn that Francisco is a doctor--but near the end) Is Tomas in a career (it seems he is not), so we must assume Francisco is the 'provider'?  Then in the final scene (spoiler!) when Francisco surprises Tomas by visiting him in Russia, the enthusiasm is all Francisco and the reponse of Tomas is almost tentative (at first).  As a gay person, I can't imagine Tomas not having a fling with a kindred spirit while over there!  They are both at an age when their hormones are raging nand both being HOT hunks (especially, Tomas),  the possibility of him (Tomas) being celebrate while in training, to me, is unreal! Therefore, I think the surprised and somewhat tepid response of Tomas was a hint he might have an ongoing fling with a fellow athlete.

Next too much time was spent in childhood with emphasis on the parents, who have little to no impact on the incestuous brothers in adulthood.  So one has to ask why such time was spent on them in the first place.

The subject matter of the film could have been really interesting but in that this film exists in some bizarro-world where pretty much everyone involved in the brother's lives seem just about 100% ok with their relationship that shatters social mores of both homosexuality as well as incest.  That alone makes it seem too unbelievable, especially all the family members.

4399431,3,B004L03B3S,"Once I accounted for my moderately deficient attention, my rating for this film went from 2 stars to three. IT'S PACED SO SLOW.

At times, it's like viewing a painting or sculpture but without all the complexity found in those media. There ARE actors as young as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and more seasoned actors like Giancarlo Esposito and Maggie Smith who can advance and build upon the complexity of the narrative using subtle gestures (often, ""repressed"" gestures) alone. Rafael Cardoso and Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos, while skillful, are not able to produce the kinds of performances that a lingering camera needs. Further impeding the flow are several extended musical - vignettes that contribute to the film's mood but to little else.

The childhood portion, an almost perfectly performed and paced act, is necessary to make the two adult actors with their extremely dissimilar appearances seem like brothers. I have a half brother (who I've never schtooped) and no one believes he and I are related at all unless they have known us since childhood. Taking so much time to show Fancisco and Toms as children help to make their romance as adults viscerally disturbing.

That said, the performances from Cardoso and Vasconcellos are quite strong and would have had more effect with tighter editing and time constraints. At a little more than 90 minutes in length, the film and its characters tend to feel unnatural (never mind the incest) when, at a streamlined 70 minutes with more dialogue, it could have been, while still disturbing, sweet and seductive.

One last thing: It was nice to watch a Brazilian film and understand almost all of the dialog. My Portuguese is low-intermediate at best and I usually need subtitles to follow the dialects of the southeast.

The topic of adult incest is very explosive -- even though one could persuasively argue that consensual and nonexploitative sex between two adults is their own business. All of the biological opposition to adult incest vanishes in the gay context - there is no risk that the partners will transmit genetic defects to their offspring. So, this is basically a moral question. And general notions of morality have done a lot of harm in society - especially to gays and lesbians.

Rather than exploring this topic with a sufficient amount of depth, the film falls very flat. We don't really get much in terms of character development. Everyone is loving and close -- the brothers, parents, maid, swim coach, and even strangers met in a nightclub. We know that the kids were very intimate as they grew up, but there is no discussion of why they became sexual as adults. It literally - just happens. There isn't much discussion of their relationship before or after they consummate their desire.

The sex scenes are very tender, and much more ""progressive"" than what you see in American films. So, I applaud the director for this. But that's about the best stuff in the movie. Really good, tender and romantic sex: this is the stuff of a Harlequin romance. More discussion about the subject of sexual morality, however, would have resulted in a better product.

Also, it seems that the men were addicted to one another. This doesn't look like the healthiest of relationships. I don't want to say too much about this, but once they start having sex, everyone and everything (other than the brothers) become irrelevant. Finally, the ending was predictable and simplistic. It is also proof of love addiction, not healthy love.

If you want to see gorgeous men love each other tenderly on screen, this movie will satisfy this craving. If you want a smart exploration of the morality surrounding adult incest -- this movie will not impress you.",1321920000,34,2144,4.831062670299728

4399440,4,B004L03B3S,"THE REACTION

I don't understand why mutually consenting sex - actually eager sex, in this case - between brothers near the same age is a big deal. It's not as if they would produce deformed offspring. That particular taboo makes no sense to me. I suppose people believe it's bad just because everybody else does and they've never bothered to ask themselves, Why?

I'm not advocating gay incest, not trying to force it on anybody, any more than I would try to force ANYTHING on anybody; but the nearly universal horror at the idea of sex between brothers - even in a movie, and even among large numbers of gay men - mystifies me.

I have never been the least bit attracted to my own brother, even though I love him a lot; but two brothers' falling in love in a movie does not make me the least bit uncomfortable. I don't feel compelled to try to twist it into something else that's more acceptable.

People who have said that it's easy to forget that Francisco and Thoms are brothers in the latter half of the movie must really be trying HARD to forget it, because the movie never stops affirming the fact that that's what they are. Fighting that battle while trying to enjoy a movie must detract a lot from the enjoyment.

WHAT'S WRONG

This is a flawed but very interesting and unusual movie, and I can understand why even the many positive reviews it gets have trouble describing it.

It has been called a fairy tale because Francisco and Thoms seem to live in a dream world as cut off from the real world as Sleeping Beauty in her castle. But aren't all young lovers like that? Isn't that what love and hormones do to young bodies and young minds? Doesn't the rest of the world tend to fall away when the beloved comes into view? That's how it was when I was young.

So to say that this movie is a fairly tale is simply to say that it is a love story. It's an unusual love story, but fundamentally it is just like any other love story in any romance movie since movies began. If anything, its depiction of the all-consuming ecstasy of young love is MORE realistic than most movies are, not less.

Others have emphasized the parents' evident oblivion or even acquiescence to what is going on under their noses, but that seems to me like just another symptom of the irrational taboo I mentioned earlier. It's like: ""What those boys are doing is WRONG! Why don't their parents stop it?"" But, again, I ask: Why? Who is hurting whom? Nobody that I can see.

When they're children, they simply love each other and love to be together, and they are freely affectionate with each other. Is that bad? Why? Should the mother slap her son when he kisses his younger brother on the head or puts his arm around him or holds him while they sleep? Why? Is fighting better? Is sibling rivalry better than sibling affection? Evidently it is to many people.

Neither of those is what I see as a weakness in this movie. It is true that the movie is unreal, but what seems most unreal to me is not the brothers' relationship with each other or even with their parents. That's just an extraordinarily loving and mutually accepting family, which is almost never seen in a movie or in real life but should be everybody's ideal of what a family ought to be. If that's not the unconditional love people rave about nowadays, I don't know what is.

What seems most unreal to me is the other adults' relationships with each other, the fantastically loving relationships between exes and in-laws and friends who are NOT in love with each other, who are NOT caught up in the heady ecstasy of hormones and young love. That excess of affection is just plain weird.

Another weakness I see is in the dialog. The core story about the relationship between the brothers is fine - it's a love story - but what people say to each other is stilted and awkward, not at all the way real people talk. It's almost like the way people talk in TV commercials. And the problem is not just in the English subtitles, which actually are very good: what they're saying in Portuguese sounds just as phony.

And the final weakness I see is in the direction. The director seems to be trying to make something besides JUST a love story, but what that other something is never comes clear. It feels as if he is intentionally trying to make it an allegory, or an epic myth, or a pantomime, or a ballet, or something else abstract that wrestles constantly with the extremely simple love story which the movie actually is.

The odd scene in which the adult brothers slowly undress for the first time as they face each other across the room is particularly strange, like something out of a kabuki performance. That obscure tension between what the movie is and what the director is trying to make it be doesn't ruin the movie, but it IS distracting.

WHAT'S RIGHT

All four actors who play the two brothers as children and then as adults are very good and very beautiful, inside at least as much as outside. What the director did an EXCELLENT job of is getting straight actors (which I assume they all are) to be so convincingly loving toward each other. Every affectionate gesture, every touch, every loving look is believable and totally convincing. That could NEVER happen in an American or Canadian movie, or even in a European movie, and I've never seen it in any other movie from Latin America. It is a unique and astonishing accomplishment.

The director also gets credit for the movie's other great accomplishment, which is simply that it got made. A movie about love, passion, unshakable devotion, loyalty, innocence, tenderness and limitless generosity between two men is rarer than hens' teeth. The scene in which they exchange wedding rings alone together at home is one of the sweetest, sexiest scenes I have ever seen. I have never seen any other movie that even comes close to the love between these two men, and I have seen hundreds and hundreds of gay movies. This is far from the best of them, but it is the most wonderful.",1318377600,21,5986,4.521739130434782
4399441,5,B004L03B3S,"It is a film with subtitles and some bad music.  Apart from that it is involving - layers are peeled back and then built upon.  Dodgy subject matter but well put together and enjoyable apart from that.

Francisco and Thomas are half brothers from the same Mother.  From the moment Thomas was born it was as if two soul mates had reconnected.  Thomas didn't open his eyes for a very long time, then suddenly opened them and looked into Francisco's eyes and that was it.  I have watched this many times and because of the subject I take brotherhood out of the equation and concentrate on the soul mates part.  I look at this as a love story...most of the time.

It's interesting though.  Sometimes I look at this and see soul mates and a love story of equals.  But sometimes I look at this and see and older dominant brother possessing the younger submissive mind, body and soul and wonder if Thomas had a chance to do anything other than submit to Francisco's obsessive love.  When I am thinking latterly I see how Francisco practically tries to eat Thomas every time they kiss, how he tries to absorb him into his body when they hug -how he touches him all the time.  When Thomas is given his `good news' by his swimming coach he seems happy until he sees Francisco's reaction.

It is easy to notice there seems to be no-one outside their immediate family that they choose to be with apart from the swim coach. Intimately involved with each other there appears to be no room for others in their lives.  The boys live for each other.

The boys Mother recognises the signs early but seems to accept that what she sees will come to fruition and it is ok.  Pedro, Francisco's father, sees it from a young age and is disturbed but the Mother says they can't say it is wrong...I disagree.  Alexandre is Thomas' father, who the family lives with all the time.  He too notices and seems reassured by his wife's acceptance of the behaviour over time.

Pedro passes and then 15 years later the Mother passes.  This seems to be a catalyst for the men to follow through on their passion.  It is though the external link to their relationship taboo is broken with their Mother dying  - Alexandre moves out of the family home, leaving the men together.  And so it begins - immediately he leaves the house.  I don't think anything physical happens before this...or if it does we don't see it.  They don't appear to have been intimate with anyone else - so their first time together is their first time I think (Francisco is about 28 and Thomas 22).  The impression is they have not been intimate (kissing or lovemaking) with anyone else.

After Alexandre moves out he openly acknowledges the relationship in his acceptance the decisions the men must make are for them to decide. When they are all skyping and when they meet in caf's it is obvious he acknowledges the intimate relationship and accepts it.

This is a movie of three parts to me.  Boys growing up, parents all there.  Thomas worships Francisco and Francisco taking ownership of Thomas.  Literally there is no doubt that for Francisco Thomas is the beginning and the end. There is no doubt also that the relationship is showing its colours in this phase.  The boys sleep together, swim together, play together and are just together.  Phase two begins when their Mother dies and it is a story of lovers and intimacy.  They live together, love together and are only with each other mostly.  Finally, when they are separated the effects of this are explored - are the changes that creep in going to allow Thomas to break free from the dominant brother.  Can Francisco cope emotionally with the separation?  It is on Francisco this phase seems to focus...for the first time he is without his soul mate - Thomas seems to cope more but this is not explored at all.  We don't see day to day lives.  We see nothing to corroborate that Francisco is a doctor )General Practitioner) - but that is what we glean from his discussion with a woman.

Francisco is so lost without Thomas he starts clubbing and hooks up with a woman...in some ways I think he finds a version of Thomas.  They start kissing eventually and we see the method of making love with Thomas being used on the girl...this brings things to an end because she notices the wedding ring for the first time.  Francisco had given Thomas a ring and had one for himself for Thomas to put on him.  After this Francisco seems to lose himself and goes to Thomas.  And this is where I again see clues that Thomas is lead by Francisco...he looks mildly happy to see him.  Francisco is ecstatic...Thomas doesn't look convince.  I almost see him realising his new life is gone...but then again I don't always interpret it this way.  Sometimes I think he can't believe Francisco is actually there and then the penny drops...

There is an abrupt end to this movie.  I would have like to see if the pair grow apart as a result of the imposed separation or if this in fact brings the soul mates closer...if that were even possible.

I enjoyed this - it moved through different phases of lives less ordinary.",1316736000,5,5093,4.536772777167947

There is a loving, extended family that share dinners and laughs. There is the main relationship between the two brothers. It is very clear from the beginning that theirs is a bond that can not be broken. The moments when they are in bed for the first time, confessing why they love each other is one of the most beautiful, romantic scenes in any movie I've ever seen.

It is so interesting to see how they cope with having to be apart for the first time in their lives.

After a while, I forgot they were brothers.  It isn't really a factor in the movie after they become adults.

I was sucked in completely in watching the adorable, loving and joyous relationship that the two young boys had as I had never witnessed siblings who were so immersed and satisfied from the mere existence of the other. It was like watching something ""other worldly"" ... theirs was a relationship to marvel upon. Only after they had made the transition to adulthood did it begin to strike me as awkward and make me feel a bit queasy because ""I knew"" that this was something the world labels ""wrong"".

That's when the window that I had been viewing their lives through and had started judging their morality became a mirror reflecting my face back to myself. I was the one that had a problem with it, they did not. It was a set of morals I had been taught as ""right"" that I was trying to hold up as a measuring stick to determine just ""how wrong"" I thought they were.

Francesco and Tom Tom had never considered their love for each other as anything other than pure and respectful and everything that true love should be. So I had to ask myself ""Why is this 'wrong'? Who am I to judge their feelings based on rules and regulations I have been taught ... taught by a world that has created its own set of 'do's and don'ts' in telling us how we are allowed to love another human being?""

Count me among those who would typically be of that belief.

But their love unfolds before viewers in such a pure, clearly undeniable and genuine manner.  Francisco and Thomas, their story and their love for each other, aren't out to change others' lifestyles or beliefs.  They simply need and want to be together ... As children, and as men.

4399450,5,B004L03B3S,"I don't think I have to delve into how touchy the subject matter is in this film . Without a doubt, anyone who finds the idea of brotherly love freaks them out will absolutely hate this film sight unseen. I am not one such viewer. I can take fiction for what it is. That is how you'll take this film if you enjoyed it. Others will be discontent that it did not delve deeper into the boys' relationship--which it could have, address issues of incest vs. the world at large--which it did not, or display any great character growth--which it certainly didn't do.

As a matter of fact the conflict in this film is very much glossed over. The mother, and more so the father, have very real insight into the potential of the changing relationship when the brothers are still boys. However, a direct confrontation never comes to fruition for reasons I will not mention here. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it.

 The only challenge for them is brought about when the youngest brother is offered a chance to train for the Olympics in another country for three years. The older brother flounders; distraught and loss and lonely without the younger brother who has never left his side. Some would argue--which is their prerogative--that the older boy somehow manipulated his sibling into 'loving' him in a manner which many would see as perverted. I think that the director/writer successfully put that suspicion to rest by featuring the first intimacy between the brothers when they are both well and truly grown. I saw no signs of manipulations from the older boy over his younger brother.

The acting was superb, the shooting of the film very artistic. The overall feel of the film was positive and happy. I very much enjoyed that the brothers were not depressed and hidden in darkness for the majority of the film. It would have been so easy to have the young men accidentally discovered in bed, to have their private relationship raked through the coals and dissected by family--to have them disowned and rejected by society. I'm glad that the film did not go that route. I've watched a enough gay romance movies with twisted and hopeless endings.

They did not come to resent one another, or be fearful of their love and relationship. This movie was aptly named. They stayed true to each other from beginning to end.",1312848000,9,2340,4.669902912621359

The relationship between the two brothers could have offered us better treatment if attention was given to character development during those all-important teen years; yet we are jolted by the swift jump from boyhood to adulthood. Also, portions of the film were crossing over to soap opera mode, including the repetitive music score.

4399456,5,B004L03B3S,"Because of the semi-controversial theme of this movie, I preface my review with some words of wisdom from a book available from the website [...]

""Flawed premise #4 (of 22): I have come here (to earth) to live the right way of life and to influence others to the same right way of living.  And what feels right to me must be the right way of living for all. ................. This flawed premise, postulating that my group's/our way of life is the only correct way, therefore all other ways must be stopped, because when I look at what I do not agree with, I feel bad, is the basis of the majority of unhappiness on your planet."" (from ""The Vortex - Where the Law of Attraction Assembles all Cooperative Relationships"" - see above website).

Most reviews focus understandably so, mainly on the 2 lead characters. However, the maturity which the other adults in this movie display warrants some reference too (in my opinion).  Firstly, there is the ongoing joyful connection between Argentinian Pedro, and his former Brazilian wife Julieta who together are the parents of the elder son, Francisco.

The movie does not reveal why they parted ways, but Julieta remarried Brazilian Alexandre, and they are the parents of the younger son, Thomas.  Francisco also lives with his mother and loving step-dad.  Pedro had previous associations with Rosa, who is now the housekeeper for Alexandre & Julieta.  One day Julieta casually tells Rosa that the two of them should have married back then - as if it is the most natural thing for two women to marry.  She continues matter-of-factly that they are in a way indeed married.

We next see a scene where Francisco is briefly in hospital to have his right leg put in a cask due to the broken tibia, and young Thomas lies with his head on his half-brother's chest listening to the beating of his heart when Julieta, who is a medical doctor at this hospital, and her husband stare at the 2 boys through the hospital corridor window.  The viewer is made aware that they observe the special relationship/bond between these two half-brothers. However, they do not verbalize their assessments.

The two boys are sent to spend the next Christmas with Francisco's father (Pedro) in Buenos Aires.  He has a new wife Lucrecia now, who takes the two boys for a walk and talk in the city - as if she could have been their mother.

After the boys' visit, Pedro comes up to Brazil to discuss with Julieta his observation of the somewhat intimate bond between the two boys, and inquired if she was aware of it.  She admits to it, but adds, ""we cannot tell the boys that their special bond is a bad thing.""

A turning point in the movie came when Alexandre comes into their living room one day and finds Thomas merrily playing with his (Alexandre's) paintbrushes and paint on sheets of paper on the floor, and he descends upon Thomas, reprimanding him for playing with his art utensils.

Upon hearing the commotion, Francisco runs into the living room and the following dialogue ensues: Francisco: ""Let go of him! Don't you ever do it again!"" Alexandre: ""He's my son."" Francisco: ""And he's my brother."" Alexandre: ""He deserved it."" Francisco: ""It doesn't matter.  From now on I'm the one who will take care of him.  Forever.""

Julieta just arrived home and saw the confrontation scene, and when the boys left the living room, she and Alexandre merely stared at each other, quite perplexed with what they've just witnessed.  If someone could have handed them the dissertation on ""Children"" from Kahlil Gibran's ""The Prophet"", it may have provided them with some ideas. Gibran addresses parents (regarding raising their children) as follow:

""You may give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts ......... You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.""

Soon after the painting incident Pedro (Francisco's father) dies; fast forward 15 years later, and Julieta dies too. At her funeral, Thomas - who beautifully narrates the unfolding story of their lives throughout the movie - once again informs us as follow: ""When mom died, I was sure the permanence of things does not depend only upon our will. There is something greater, mysterious, unreachable which determines the calendar of our days. Somehow that knowledge touched us in a surprisingly liberating way.""

After his wife's death, Alexandre decides to move out and leaves the house for Francisco and Thomas (now approximately 25 & 20 respectively) to continue their lives on their own, while he finds his own accommodation elsewhere in the city. This is where the director starts showing the viewer up-close the extraordinary relationship which had developed between the two consenting adults (main characters). The morning scene upon their awakening in bed is one of the most hauntingly beautiful, romantic scenes I have ever witnessed in all of the many, many movies I have watched.

When Francisco announces his deep feelings and love for Thomas, the latter playfully asks ""why?"" to every statement.  Soon the roles are reversed when Thomas declares his love for Francisco.  The latter also asks ""why?"", and Thomas's last two answers will stay with me forever: ""I love you because to understand our love they'd need to turn the world upside down.  I love you because you could love somebody else, yet still you love me - just me.""

The movie could have ended right here, and I will have been completely satisfied.  However, writer & director Aluizio Abranches takes us further on the ever evolving journey through the lives of our two main characters.  Thomas admired Francisco's swimming talent as a young boy, and committed to swim as well as him when he grows up.  And he did - and better; so much so that he gets chosen for Brazil's Olympic swim team 3 years down the line.  There is however a catch to the selection: he needs to relocate to Russia to train and practice there.

Thomas does not want to leave Francisco for three years to go to Russia, while Francisco encourages him to accept the opportunity. The deeply personal conversation between Thomas and his father in a restaurant soon afterwards, asking for his advice, is a joy to watch.  Alexandre affirms that he will support Thomas in any decision, and then concludes: ""This is an issue you two will have to resolve alone.""  What a dad!!

I refrain from divulging Thomas's decision, so that every prospective viewer can discover for themselves the continuing unfolding of this extraordinary film, made from the heart about characters all living from their hearts.  I own a copy of this movie; have watched it several times and will watch it many more times in future.

The 96 minutes running time of this film is over all too soon for me with every viewing.  I rate ""Do Comeco Au Fim (From Beginning To End) (in Portuguese with English sub-titles) one of the 5 movies of which the script satisfies me most - ever; and with every re-watching too.  It helps that all the actors are extremely endearing and likeable people.

4399458,5,B004L03B3S,"Although the Brazilin film ""From Beginning to End"" tackles the very controversial subject of homosexual love between two half brothers, it does not try to persuade the audience of its rightness or of its wrongness.  There is no ""preaching"" of its feelings.  What the film, to me, really shows is a beautiful love story between two individuals that happen to be half brothers.  Their love evolves and unfolds from early childhood with the film showing them as very ""close"" siblings--""rough housing"", playing,  taking baths, looking after each other, etc,  The film shows a very ideal time  for them as kids and their ""upper-class""  parents that only at one point question their ""closeness"".  The film shows their childhood kind of just unfolding as childhoods tend to do.  During this ""childhood unfolding"" Francisco and his younger half brother, Tom, fall deeper in love.  By the time adulthood is reached, the two very handsome half brothers (acted wonderfully and very naturally by two beautiful Brazilian actors) are in a ""full blown"" love affair.

Adult love affairs tend to always have a problem or two.  Francisco and Tom are separated and their love for each other is, of course, threatened.

It is absolutely because they are biologically brothers who have always loved and adored each other that makes the depth of the relationship possible, wonderful, and unbreakable. Their parents are exceptionally sensitive people who actually nurtured the relationship by allowing it to thrive.

After watching the film, I knew that these relationships must exist far more than we are aware of, and from as far back as near the beginning of time.

4399460,5,B004L03B3S,"i found this to be a though provoking as well beautifully crafted love story.
of course as many people have already mentioned the two people involved are
half brothers. this may initially turn people off from viewing it. on the
other side of the coin i have to say director & writer Aluisio Abranches will
win you over so that you will simply view it as a film about two young people
in love. a great deal of help in this regard is the lush score by Andre
Abujamra.

the story starts out when when the two brothers are say 6 and 11. this section
occupies say the first third of the film. then there's a 15 year jump and we
now Francisco and Thomas as young adults played respectively by Joao Gabriel
Vasconcellos and Rafael Cardoso. i'm hedging the bet the director chose these
two actors for their stunning physical beauty.

the first disruption to the closeness in the relationship occurs when Thomas
is offered a spot in the Brazilian swim to compete at the next Olympics. the
down side is he'll have to relocate to Russia for the training period. during
this period they communicate via video chats on their laptops. one such chat
also includes Alexandre Tomas's father and Francisco's stepfather. Alexandre
can easily sense just from listening to the tone of his sons voices the sadness
in the separation. this is brought up again when Francisco and Alexandre meet
the next day meet for lunch at a cafe. if he had suspicions about the degree of
Francisco's sadness from the phone chat he can now see it clearly in Francisco's
eyes. i won't spoil the ending is all i'm saying.

now i'm sure everyone will agree there has never been nor will there ever be
any such thing as a 100% perfect film. so here are the two elements of the film
that confound me.

*in the beginning section of the film there are a few mentions made by adults
 as to how ""close"" Thomas and Franciso appear to be. at one point the two boys
 spend the Christmas holiday with Francisco's father Pedro who lives in Buenos
 Aires. when Pedro brings them back home to Rio he has a talk about their
 apparent ""closeness"" with his ex-wife with whom Pedro is still on excellent
 speaking terms. i can imagine two uptight Wasp parents in Indiana having the
 discussions but i can't picture it happening in Brazil. also i just don't see
 how the affection they show for each other in the beginning section of the
 film is so outrageous it should raise anyone's eyebrows.

*the film begins with a voice over narration by the young adult Thomas about
 the day he was born and how he didn't open his eyes till the first time
 Francisco came to visit to see him at the hospital. i'm guessing this is the
 directors way of saying the film is a flashback of sorts. the interesting part
 is is that not only is Thomas's voice over narration sparse to begin with it
 ends altogether at the point Thomas goes to Russia for training.now considering
 the last scene one can interpret the voice over narration two ways. a) an
 older Thomas infering that while they'll always be brothers and still love
 eachother he and Francisco were eventually no longer a ""couple"". or b) that
 the narration is simply Thomas in Russia wondering why Francisco let him go so
 easily to the point of wondering if they'll ever be ""together"" again. i go
 for b) since as stated the narration ends once Thomas leaves for Russia. this
 would therefore make the last scene the utterly romantic ending i was hoping
 for.",1309737600,,3450,4.524193548387097

I think that even if Franciso had been sent to live with his father in Argentina (when the boys were young), I think he & Thomas would have ended up as adult lovers anyway. I think the mother knew that too. It was almost like she knew their bond was like some unstoppable force. She KNEW that there was nothing to be done.

DIALOG SPOILER ALERT: When Pedro said: ""...I love you because for them to understand our love, they'd have to turn the world upside down. I love you because you can have anyone you want. But you chose me..."" OK, that pretty much did me in.

4399464,5,B004L03B3S,"This is one of those films I had been meaning to see for a while, and now wonder what took me so long. It is a Brazilian love story put simply. It tells the story of two brothers, who from the moment they set eyes on one another form a bond that is unbreakable.

Their mother has remarried, so they actually have different fathers, but even she thinks that the closeness of their relationship is odd. They seem to do everything together, and both have a love and talent for swimming. This leads the younger to be chosen to swim in the Olympics. On his return the enforced separation brings the brotherly love of youth, screaming into adulthood, as emotions take on a more physical nature.

That is obviously not the whole thing, there are family emotions and grief, but this is all told in a beautifully poetic way. This is presented as a moving love story, the participants just happen to be half brothers. It has a wonderful musical score too and is both shot and acted superbly. It is in Portuguese with English sub titles, only one problem is when there is some Spanish it comes up in Portuguese, but that didn't really put me off as it is basic stuff.

4399465,4,B004L03B3S,"""From Beginning to End"" (""Do Comeo ao Fim"") is a beautiful 2009 film from Brazil, which tells the story of two boys lifelong love for each other, emotionally, physically and - eventually - sexually.  The twist is that they are half brothers, and their parents caught on that they were ""perhaps too close,"" yet could not justify making it an issue.

The film starts with the birth of the younger (about five years) sibling, and shows them at various stages in their lives, as young children, a bit older and dealing with a death in  the family, and then in young adulthood.  The older brother, Francisco, is a physician, while Thomas has followed in his brother's footsteps as a competitive swimmer.  The problem is that Thomas gets an offer to train with the Olympic team in Russia for the upcoming Games, which would be the first time they were ever really apart.

Nicely photographed and scored, with realistic dialogue (The latter is in Portuguese, and the English subtitles are a bit challenging to follow, since the characters talks so fast.)  The siblings' sexual relationship doesn't manifest itself until they are both in their 20's, but it is still controversial and handled as tastefully as possible. The actors playing them as adults are both attractive and capable actors, and their scenes together are quite romantic as well as homoerotic, perhaps making you easily forget the fact that they are supposed to be siblings.  The plot is pure simplicity, simply showing the relationship to be as ""natural"" as possible, and succeeds in that respect, although it is far from riveting entertainment.  Extras are limited to trailer and chapter stops.  Not rated, but would be an R for the subject matter, sexual situations and partial male nudity.  I give it four stars out of five.",1309132800,,1787,4.8841059602649
4399466,5,B004L03B3S,"The world of From Beginning to End resembles a fairy tale's:  a rich world, like a castle's, and therefore, in some ways, free for those who belong to it; a beautiful world and beautiful people, full of grace and gifts; a world in which nature and the elements, especially water, are part of what people take joy in almost as much as they do in one another;  and it is a world of step-siblings.  But unlike, say, the step sisters in Cinderella, or the dark fairy tale-like world of the step brothers in King Lear, the brothers are not rivals or cruel to one another.  They are, instead, lovers.  Though Francisco's father dies and the two boys' mother dies much too young as well, though death and even doubts momentarily intrude upon the boys' lives, most of this movie takes place in light.  Even many of the more dimly lit scenes, as of the brothers making love in bed or dancing, have a radiance, an inner light to them.
  There is something of the spirit of Latin American magic realism to this film, more so, perhaps, than there may seem to be at first viewing.  When the brothers do make and declare their love, seemingly for the first time, after their mother's death, the moment is filmed in a way that is in no sense ""naturalistic.""  It is carefully styled and artful.  The sensuality, the eroticism is thereby heightened and intensified.  Like much in magic realism, perhaps an overused term which I am borrowing for convenience's sake, the ""magic"" lies in the way its excesses, its transcendence of realism's commonsense, reveal a profounder real than realism, with its reliance on surfaces and materialism, can.  This is true of many other scenes in the movie that might look realistic at first,  though others, as when their mother joins her sons after her death as they swim or when the two brothers dance naked, bathed in a filtered amber light, clearly mean to expand the movie's world beyond naturalistic limits.  It is, after all, a film much about sight, about what Thoms saw in his brother's eyes when the younger brother opened his own late, the shift from black and white to color mimicking in a way what the unseeing baby boy sees until his brother enters his world.  And what he sees, what color means, the movie says, is love, from beginning to the end.  In every sense, this is its vision, how it sees one with what it sees.
  Perhaps it is the genius of some comedies to make seem possible a world otherwise believed to be impossible.  I mean those comedies which are free from irony and the critical, skeptical side of the comic spirit.  It is a comedy at its greatest in music, rare in words, in part because it is so audacious.  How can one imagine a world in which love begins at the beginning and ends only at the end, at death, if then?  Narrative demands drama and drama demands conflict.  But From Beginning to End mostly lacks it, save in the troubles that ensue when Thoms leaves for Russian to train for the Olympics.
  Before Thoms goes, partly prodded by Francisco-a motif of love as self-surrender is introduced here-and before Francisco offers Thoms a wedding ring (on the right hand rather than on the left, since this is another beginning as yet), Francisco reads from a book, largely in praise of men loving men, though it does speak, not kindly,  of women, too.  That passage predicts how Francisco will react to Thoms's absence and their separation.  In a way, by reading it aloud, he is letting them both know.  It speaks of the love of male love but also of danger.  He goes out, he parties, he invites a woman he meets back to the brothers' home, he kisses her, too forcefully, in a way that hurts her some-not a passionate kiss, but a self-conscious one, it would seem.  (Perhaps it is a woman and not a man he would seduce precisely because a man would be too dangerous, too close to his own desires.)  But she sees the ring and stops their petting, obviously to Francisco's relief.  This episode is the realization of the occasional, but insistent talk about 'jealous' and 'jealousy' that Francisco usually initiates that is his serpent in the garden.  This is the ""conflict"" or threat, and Francisco must experience it, must make it overt, not just use its words.  Thoms senses that.  It is his worry, too.  He knows, or fears, that the words Francisco has used may be becoming real.  And, yes, we do see some of that still lingering on his face in the last scene in the movie.  But he has just been listening, smiling broadly, to Francisco's reciting Shakespeare's ""Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments,"" in Portuguese of course, and then opens the door to find Francisco there, in Russia.  The last shot of all is Thoms's smile, close to elation or, anyway, close enough to suggest that the love between them is the love of which Shakespeare's sonnet 116 speaks:  ""an ever fixd mark.""
  The brothers' elation at that ""fixd mark"" seems to me much the abiding spirit of this profound film.  Even their parents come to share in it, whatever doubts they may have had at first that their intimacy might become ""sexualized.""  As has been noted elsewhere, when the two brothers are telling each other why they love each other, Thoms, the film's ""narrator"" at times, says, ""I love you because to understand our love they'd have to turn the world upside down.""  He's speaking of the double taboo, in many minds, of gay incest, of course.  But he's also at least intimating that their permanent love, one that endures throughout two lives for good, an intimacy so complete it is  incomprehensible, one they share throughout their lives, would also make others have to turn their world upside down.  What would the world be like if such love were real, more real than any of the stories of love told before, whether in fairy tales or novels or movies?  That is the deeper taboo no  ""realism"" could speak of it, depict, tell its story.  And even history, even art would seem to be over the centuries against it.  A love so complete, both have claimed, must notoriously end in separation or death.  Realism dictates it cannot last.
  What From Beginning to End dares to offer is the comedy of a permanent and complete love that breaks all the rules, that is, in effect, magical-that lives beyond the way the world is supposed to be.  The film understands the need for it to be tried, to be brought into question, and then restored.  This is, after all, the structure of comedy.  But this comedy, just as Thoms says, requires those who affirm it to turn their world upside down, to erase their previous sense of love, founded in realism, say, and bring to it a new vision.  For From Beginning to End is in many ways a visionary film.  It may resemble fairy tales in many respects.  But it is not finally limited by their dictates and their archetypes.  It expands beyond them.  It is a movie in love with a vision of an enduring love that revisions the world.",1308700800,7,6924,4.572705117790414
4399467,1,B004L03B3S,"This incest love story about two half brothers in Brazil is a small disaster .

12 year old Francisco and 6 year old Thomas are as lovingly protective of each other as siblings can be . Various family members do take notice of this and while midly worried about it taking a wrong turn , they quickly accept it as a possible scenario for the two kids . Fast forward fifteen years and they both have become absolutely gorgeous and are now crazy in love with each other . Not an eyebrow is raised throughout the film by any remaining family members or friends . The drama only comes into the equation when Thomas gets an offer to prepare to swim for the olympic team of his country in Russia . Now , for the first time , the two men will have to eventually spend some time away from each other .

Despite it's controversial theme , this is not a challenging film ...it's the quitte opposite really . There's no real character development what so ever and it's difficult to sympathise with a relationship the viewer knows nothing about . Were there struggles the men had to face in order to undertand or accept their love ? Have they been single up until this point ? Are they gay or just in love with each other ? ( in a curious twist , Francisco starts flirting with a girl once Thomas is away ) . The zero chemistry between actors Vasconcellos and Cardoso also doesn't help either.

I don't know if director Abranches wants to say  that he considers his two heroes' relationship the most natural choice when there's so much true love involved , and that's why he places it in such a tolerant , open-minded social scenery or if he didn't have a script to work with in the first place . The movie is dedicated to his parents, but i enden up not giving a damn about any of the two men or what might happen between them . The film is indeed schocking . It's schocking how indifferent it really is .",1308700800,15,1893,4.279329608938547
4399468,5,B004L03B3S,The great energy and depth of the love between the brothers is joyous and a true insight into a one of kind bond that will never end. Beautiful! A love so perfect the lovers can never be separated because they only exist as one impossible to separate entity. It was right and natural and prefect when they were together. It was unbearable when they were apart. They hurt no one. I don't see this kind of perfect happiness happening often between bothers but if it exists for some unique people then the only thing that would be wrong would be to forbid a love so deep and so joyful.,1308700800,5,582,4.348623853211009

Painfully sad in a few places,but love and passion expressed leaving the viewer with a sense that true and unconditional love can and does exist often from the places no one would expect.  For me the film was great. At some points in each of our lives there are a few very special people that come into our lives changing it forever. This love may last as a brief moment in time, or may be the one true love that last for a lifetime.

I give ""From Beginning to End"" a five star rating.  You have to expierence a love so deep, so strong and powerful as was shared here to somewhat understand and appreciate these passions from the heart.",1308355200,7,744,4.369565217391305
4399470,2,B004L03B3S,"The first 1/3, introducing us to the boys chemistry and closeness during their adolescence, is intriguing. Characters around them question their intimacy and work on their understanding. Perhaps only to expose that the boys are actually half brothers, there's some exploration on the positions of the divorced parents regarding the brothers. The two boys live with mom and second husband, the father of the younger boy. They happily visit the father of the older boy and his new wife with no conlict in the relationships of all of the parents.
Then the expostion of the subject is abruptly abandoned as mom has died and dad number two leaves the house, (a bad set direction leaves the home's interiors EXACTLY the same years later) to the two now adult brothers. The film immediatley devolves into a maudlin, erotic romance piece, with some exposition on separation, lovely cinematography and use of visuals, but making nothing of the controversial subject. Most contemporary human beings in most of the world's cultures are wired not to engage immediate family romantically or sexually. It's an obvious anomoly that isn't explored in these two men's relationship. Even if the intention was to demonstrate it as their normal, or that such a relationship can be accepted, there was no exposition of that point of view. The bad acting also underserves the themes. The two adult leads bear no resemblance, fine they're 1/2 brothers, but as actors they deliver no gravitas beyond their stellar good looks. It seemed to me a lost opportunity to explore the topic in lieu of being an erotic romance piece. It was a frustrating experience for this viewer.",1307923200,7,1648,5.018248175182482

The film is fearless and daring in many ways as its touches on some very taboo subject matters. It slowly creeps up to you, but once this drama sees the boys as grown men, it takes a very nostalgic mood. There is a very haunting aspect to this film that will leave you lulled and wanting more. There is also a certain amount of sadness eminent from the fantastic performances from Rafael Cardoso and Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos. Both these men light up the screen, and their chemistry was incendiary with a very fierce dynamic relationship that takes twists and turns in many directions but ultimately leaves you yearning for what was once between them. The film is pretty much about life changes and how some of the best times are hard to let go as mere memories. Both brothers, in their own way, must deal with life's changes and its unexpectedness. Very poetic and always eloquent in its storytelling, dealing with such difficult subject matter was flawlessly handled sensitively in the very capable hands of Aluisio Abranches. Brazil should be proud to have this film. It represents very well the beautiful people of Brazil, their culture and it give you great insight of a culture that is filled with traditions as well as strong family and community ties.

The love story was beautiful and full of real passion and feeling. I think anyone would dream of being so lucky to have a  connection to someone on this intense of a level. I wasn't offended by the content or the nudity. It was what the movie needed to show the true passion of the relationship. I have recommended it to a few friends already. The ending was disappointing and the movie just seemed to stop without a real finish to it. Maybe an ending like that was in reality the perfect ending.

We as humans try to understand it and put a line through it, but there is NO limit, or line because love is indefinent and defined as a never changing aspect of life.
