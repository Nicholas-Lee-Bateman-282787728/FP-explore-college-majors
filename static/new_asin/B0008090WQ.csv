8054893,3,B0008090WQ,Disappointing effort.  It is just OK.  The tunes aren't going to get you much applause at a party. The riff she plays as the DVD ends is what she should have taught. Meh.,1405382400,,170,4.121212121212121
8054894,5,B0008090WQ,"The Tricia Woods intro to blues piano comes in three versions
or formats. You can get just the book. You can get the book plus
a CD to accompany it. Or you can get the book plus the video DVD.

The book is great, I found hardly any use for the music CD, and the
DVD is stellar. So I suggest you don't waste your money on any of the
products except for the combo of the book plus the DVD (which is the
hardest combination to find but there are still some out there).

Sadly Tricia Woods - who was a phenomenal musician and an equally talented
music teacher - died at a young age back around 2011. May she rest in peace
and may you benefit from her legacy through her blues book and DVD package.",1376524800,,693,4.0144927536231885
