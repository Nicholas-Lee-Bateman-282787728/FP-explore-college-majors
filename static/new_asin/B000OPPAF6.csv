2798634,5,B000OPPAF6,"I was so happy to see this latest Ozu collection as I had been purchasing, individually, other Ozu films.  These films were made a bit later than the earlier Ozu films I had purchased.  I am just very interested in post-war Japan and so these films seem to capture this era beautifully.  They are very ""simple"" stories of relationships, filmed in black and white. Having just recently visited Japan, the landscape seemed to touch me after having seen some of Ozu's earlier films.  I thought of these films and their stories a lot while travelling through Japan - both in some large cities, as well as some beautiful rural areas of Japan.",1185840000,3,637,4.660714285714286
2798635,4,B000OPPAF6,"The quietude and lack of pretense in Yasujiro Ozu's idiosyncratic films continue to draw me to his impressive body of work, which gratefully continues to be restored by the Criterion Collection. From the stationary, tatami-level camera angles to the selective re-use of his familiar ensemble cast, Ozu displays an unforced cinematic style unique in its deliberate pacing and elliptical narrative structures. As it should be, his most acclaimed work is the ""Noriko"" trilogy -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Late-Spring/dp/B000EOTWIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Late Spring</a>&nbsp;(1949),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Early-Summer/dp/B00026L7MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Early Summer</a>&nbsp;(1951) and the extraordinary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Story/dp/B00005JLV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Story</a>&nbsp;(1953) - which has been given deluxe DVD treatments by Criterion in individual packages in the past few years. His career continued until his death in 1962, and this box set from Criterion's subsidiary Eclipse celebrates five of the films he made after ""Tokyo Story"". Because there are none of the extras to be found in the previously released DVDs, neither an informative commentary from a film scholar nor a historical documentary, the films are left to stand on their own albeit with English subtitles. They represent a solid collection from a master, but I also think they are best appreciated after seeing the ""Noriko"" trilogy or his other masterpiece, 1959's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Floating-Weeds/dp/B0001GH5RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Floating Weeds</a>&nbsp;where you get in-depth orientations into Ozu's filmmaking style.

The set begins with 1956's ""Early Spring"" (****), a penetrating, unusually mature study in infidelity in post-WWII Japan. Ozu places his focus on Shoji, a young, inconsequential white collar worker suffering from weariness about his job and childless marriage to Masako. He starts to spend more time with his colleagues and less with his pragmatic wife. One of his co-workers is an independent-minded stenographer who has been affectionately named ""Goldfish"". A seemingly innocent flirtation leads inevitably to a full-blown affair. Even more than his more famous films, Ozu spends a lot of time on establishing shots to highlight Shoji's mundane existence, and the net effect is more insinuating in terms of defining his boredom and dead-end career. Ryo Ikebe and Chikage Awashima (the feisty best friend regaling in her freedom to be single in ""Early Summer"") play the young couple affectingly, though Keiko Kishi easily steals her scenes as the ambitious Goldfish.

The darkest of the five films is 1957's ""Tokyo Twilight"" (****1/2), which showcases Ozu's craftsmanship encased in a Douglas Sirk-like melodrama about two sisters leading lives of quiet desperation in spite of the earnest though clueless efforts of their father. With her baby daughter in tow, patient older sister Takako has just left her errant, self-absorbed husband. Petulant younger sister Akiko keeps searching for a boyfriend amid her social circle, a group of sarcastic slackers who spend all their time playing mah jong and gossiping. The sisters' bad choice in men can be sourced to not only a guilt-ridden father but a mother who deserted them long ago. She comes back to town followed in quick order by the inevitable consequences. Shorn of her usually sunny exterior, the legendary Setsuko Hara lends intense, complex melancholy to Takako, while Ineko Arima portrays Akiko with a hedonistic fury worthy of Louise Brooks. As the absentee mother, Isuzu Yamada has a few powerful scenes, while Ozu regular Chishu Ryu plays the father in his typically poker-faced manner.

A comparatively lighter tone can be found in Ozu's first color film, 1958's ""Equinox Flower"" (****1/2), which explores a favorite theme of the filmmaker's, the bond between a father named Hirayama and his daughter Setsuko. True to her contemporary nature, she makes an impulsive decision to marry, even though Hirayama had always expected that she would seek his approval beforehand. Reflective of prevailing customs, he is presumptuous enough to think he would choose her husband. At the same time, in contrast, he provides advice to others to follow their own hearts. The hypocrisy gradually dawns on the well-intentioned father in slow, uninterrupted takes, as Setsuko quietly rebels. Shin Saburi effectively manages to convey both the comic confusion and dawning revelation of a man caught in a generational transition, while Ineko Arima returns with a sunnier persona as Setsuko.

1960's ""Late Autumn"" (****) is really a variation on his classic 1949 father-daughter drama, ""Late Spring"". He goes further with this parallel by having Setsuko Hara, who played the daughter in the original film, play the mother Akiko in this one. This time, the character of Akiko has such an easy sisterly bond with her daughter Ayako that neither has an interest in dating or marriage. While Akiko's situation is accepted by society, Ayako's single status is a point of consternation, especially for three friends of Akiko's late husband, all of whom express feelings of unrequited love for the unavailable Akiko. Lending her remarkable sense of pathos, Hara provides her trademark stillness and quiet warmth as Akiko. Yko Tsukasa is pretty and affecting as Ayako, while Mariko Okada provides an uninhibited spirit as Ayako's friend and colleague Yuriko. Shin Saburi, Nabuo Nakamura and Ryuji Kita play the matchmaking trio almost like a Shakespearean comedy troupe.

The last film of the set, 1961's ""End of Summer"" (****) has Setsuko Hara and Yko Tsukasa of ""Late Autumn"" return as sisters Akiko and Noriko, both in search of husbands. They are the daughters of Manbei Kohayakawa, who seems to be going through his second childhood as his sake brewery flounders into a financial abyss. When Manbei takes up with his old mistress, the family is thrown into chaos as Ozu melds both comic and tragic elements into the deliberately paced story. Fittingly, the story's rueful last act echoes the poignant ending of ""Tokyo Story"". The rubric of change and resistance within a family is explored in depth and within the elliptical structure that is the filmmaker's trademark. Ganjiro Nakamura (the aging kabuki actor in Ozu's ""Floating Weeds"") plays Manbei with surprising subtlety, while Hara and the rest of the ensemble cast complement him impeccably.",1185753600,26,6636,5.795081967213115
2798636,5,B000OPPAF6,"I've been so looking forward to this release and am thoroughly enjoying this new Ozu set during my vacation week. I strongly suggest a back-to-back viewing of ""Late Spring"" (a separate Criterion release) and ""Late Autumn,"" included here in this set. A side-by-side viewing will only enhance the comic explosion ""Late Autumn"" will set off in your head. I am astounded by the gorgeous, intricate weaving of plot lines in Late Autumn -almost suggestive of the strange, inexplicable balance of forms one finds in a Kandinsky painting. What a sly, lovely film maker that Ozu is!",1183766400,2,573,4.979166666666667
2798637,5,B000OPPAF6,"I won't talk about the five great films you get in the box set ""Late Ozu"".  As has been said before: the name Ozu and the word ""great"" are synonymous. But I thought I might warn you about the ""box"".

  This box set doesn't have one.  But what's that in the photo you see up above?  That, friend, is a slip case -- a piece of cardboard with four sides.  There is no top, no bottom... no box.

  What you're actually buying is 5 discs in the new slimline cases held together by a sleeve.  A sturdy sleeve, yes, but one that shifts form into a parallelogram depending on how you hold it.  Either way, make sure you hold it horizontally.  As I mentioned, there is no top and no bottom.  Hold it the way you'd initially be inclined to and all five slimcases promptly slide out the bottom. Does this make sense?  Who builds a box with no bottom?

  I'm grateful Criterion has created the new Eclipse series and is thus bringing us films we wouldn't usually have access to, but why lie about the packaging?  Yes, the photo they provide is a lie.  If you look at that you imagine a slipcase that opens on the side, properly holding your movies, right?  Or a fold-out box keeping your precious new Ozu discs snug in a logical manner.  Who enjoys pulling something off the shelf with their other hand supporting the bottom so the contents don't spill?

  Speaking for myself, if I had seen the product properly when it was advertised I wouldn't feel cheated and disappointed right now.",1183593600,11,1475,4.374074074074074
2798638,5,B000OPPAF6,"Now we have 5 more late ozu films to digest - and such a delicious meal it is... Yasijuro ozu's films are noted for their simplicity and their sensitivity to the family dynamic.. As a master of his craft ozu's films are deceptively packed with details and very methodic in their construction.. His pacing combined with character revelations often leave us feeling completely satisfied at the end of the picture as if he has taken us down to a meditative place and let us emerge back into our own worlds at the end of the picture.. But speaking of such things is useless.. you need to watch these family dramas for yourself to understand the kinds of feelings that will emerge inside of you..
Ozu was a technician perhaps more quiet than directors like hitchcock, lang, or even kurosawa and mizoguchi - but his movies speak volumes without the extra action and manipulations.. That is probably why so many people find his work refreshing..

This box set contains 5 movies that are among his most effective.. my particular favorite was 'the end of summer' which featured some of his actors from previous films including Ganjiro nakamura as the very childlike grandfather figure.. This movie for me is one of Ozu's best - also it utilizes color in a very striking way (for another fine example of ozu's color see floating weeds).. The other films are also in the same league.. equinox flower is another favorite of mine..

Criterion collections new eclipse series is truly a most welcome venue to discover older movies that you may not have seen.. There is also an excellent collection of early bergman movies now available - and a samuel fuller box is on the way.. It is well worth the price..",1183075200,16,1691,4.70945945945946
2798639,5,B000OPPAF6,"First the ""bad"" news: you don't get the usual Criterion extras (commentaries/documentaries) for this release.  Each movie has only chapter search and subtitle switch.
Now the good news: you do get very good audio/video (supposedly not restored by Criterion, but I couldn't tell the difference); the price per film is low; the contents of the box are unsurpassable: five major mature Ozu films, which means all of a sudden we have no less than ten late-period Ozu movies plus a silent release available from Criterion.
Was there a greater moviemaker than Ozu?  Watch all eleven and you may find yourself asking that question.",1182729600,47,624,5.048543689320389

2798641,5,B000OPPAF6,"Ozu's films are profoundly affecting and leaves us dwelling in his world long after a viewing. The extras usually found on the single-titled discs are missing here, which is unfortunate. The commentaries, interviews and documentaries gives us even more to appreciate. On those discs with the extras I've gained a deeper understanding of his creative process and the historic context in which he made the films. Still this collection is such a bargain and no fan of Ozu will be disappointed.",1371513600,,490,5.061728395061729
2798642,4,B000OPPAF6,"This film employs the standard Ozu formula which was perfected in Tokyo Story: some social commentary and personal conflict resulting from the mundane elements of everyday Japanese life.

The social commentary in Early Spring focuses on Japan's conversion from a pre-war artisanal culture to a post-war corporate culture filled with salaried employees who are resigned to their regimented jobs.  The personal conflict involves an extramarital affair.  I'm not sure what early spring means but it would describe the early stages of Japan's post-World War II recovery.

The technical film quality seems poor at times due to inadequate lighting but this film warrants four stars because it approaches the same emotional effect of Tokyo Story.  It is an interesting film for Ozu fans and those interested in Japanese culture.",1364601600,,821,5.3828125
2798643,5,B000OPPAF6,"I love these all five movies very much. I am now over 60 years old and live in California, so, they reminded and recalled me my families, friends and good old days in Japan.",1332979200,,173,4.117647058823529
2798644,5,B000OPPAF6,"I hate to turn people to other websites, but the third parties selling this collection are marking it up way too much.  You can buy the collection new for $56 or so on the Criterion website.  With free shipping.  I'm just trying to inform people due to the unscrupulous re-sellers.

Now on to the set:  This is a great collection of marvelous films from Yasujiro Ozu, one of my favorite and one of the most underrated directors in the world (in my opinion).  He gets a lot of flack for having a very similar story and style to his films, but that is one of the aspects I enjoy most about his work.

Tokyo Story was his most regarded film (other than Floating Weeds possibly), but this collection includes my personal favorite film of his: Early spring.  Though I think they are all lovely films, beautifully shot and lovingly brought to life by terrific actors.  Setsuko Hara and Chishu Ryu were two of the regulars in Ozu's films.  I did enjoy early in their career that they were also in several Kurosawa films.  (just a fun fact)  But it is Chishu Ryu who continues to impress me with his quiet and thoughtful performances.

These films are all very quiet and stately.  There is not a lot of dialogue.  This is evidenced by the fact that Ozu preferred silent film, and he was one of the last major Japanese directors to embrace 'talking pictures' as well as color films later in his career.  His first color film is in this set.  And unlike several Japanese directors whose first color films were lackluster, Ozu maintained his style and kept the colors mostly muted with the exception of a few key shots.

Ozu had a very interesting life and it reflects in his films.  He focuses on Japanese family life, often centered around marriage or a death in the family.  His films show the struggles of the family and the coming together and hope through tragedy or the promise of happiness in the future.  No matter how sad and heart wrenching his films may be, there is always the message of hope.

Ozu was a master, and this is truly a magnificent set to add to any collection.  Criterion is amazing, and despite the lack of extras, this is a wonderfully restored and pristine set.",1323561600,,2180,4.505102040816326
2798645,5,B000OPPAF6,"A great set of films for those who enjoy post-war Japanese cinema (late 1950's early 1960's).  Three of the films start Hara, Setsuko, the premier Japanese actress of this period.  Those looking for Samurai action should skip this series as the series, and many of Ozu's films, focus on family life in post-war Japan.  The films reflect Japanese life and traditions and the transition between generations in the mid-twentieth century.

The first two films are in black and white, the other three reflect the transition to color at the turn of the decade.  We enjoyed both formats.  All films are in Japanese with English subtitles.",1231545600,3,631,4.961904761904762
2798646,5,B000OPPAF6,"Only a few times in an epoch or a century does an artist come along who is what would one call a special case, either because of the excellence and integrity of their contribution, their originality, or even their inherent sense of pleasure. Ozu, like a Shakespeare, a Jane Austen, or a Tarkovsky IS one of those cases. I have little to actually say about these films except for the following: they are about family life, their creators have love for their creations and their characters, they are elegant, simple but never simple minded and unafraid of beauty or genuine human emotion. They are very much Japanese and yet are for everyone. (real family entertainment). And they are as enlightening as they are entertaining. In short, they have much of life in them. Be open and see where they take you.",1230768000,4,803,4.702127659574468
2798647,5,B000OPPAF6,"""Eclipse Series #3 Late Ozu"" is an absolute delight. It used to be hard to get Ozu until Criterion did us this favor. Sure, I miss the ""extras"" and commentaries, and little pamphlets and geegaws that embellish other Criterion Collection releases: such as the latest ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Ugetsu""...with all the bells and whistles.

But, darn it, it is the film itself that is the substance, and in this series Ozu comes to us with the fullness of his vision. Commentary? We don't need no stinking commentary. The films speak to us, gently breaking our hearts. A must for those who love film.",1203552000,6,590,4.728155339805825
2798648,5,B000OPPAF6,Another fine Criterion Collection edition of the latter work of THE consummate Japanese filmmaker.  For the true cineaste and connoisseur of Japanese culture.  An excellent selection and a good value.,1200182400,2,200,5.633333333333334
2798649,5,B000OPPAF6,"THE SET: I've seen the complaints about less-than-pristine picture quality and the three-sided piece of paper that constitutes the ""box."" Look, we're being handed five rarely-seen films by Yasujiro Ozu! Complaining about the packaging or minor picture imperfections is like receiving a fortune in rare pearls and griping that they come in a paper bag and still smell faintly of sea water.  Get over it.

EARLY SPRING (5 stars): This is my favorite of the lot, demonstrating what Ozu does best: it presents a clearly-stated theme, and then slowly lets ""secondary"" characters take over the narrative from an unexpected direction. Seemingly, this is about the gray, monotonous life of the ""salaryman"" in post-war Japan. It does illustrate that life, but to see this as a sort of Asian MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT is to miss the point. Ozu's films pivot on what is off-camera, or on what is NOT being acted on the faces of those on-camera. Before launching his corporate slice-of-life, Ozu reveals whom to watch from the first face we see--that of Masako (Chikage Awashima), lying on her futon, sleepless as the day dawns. Over the course of the film, we learn what her anxiety is about. We hear competing views on how to survive a failing marriage. Most viewers will long for her to dump her selfish husband, Shoji. We will see her confront him firmly, but with astonishing decorum. This, keep in mind, is in the context of a film where Shoji has roughly double the screen time of Masako. That's what you get with Ozu. The real story is often just out of frame.

TOKYO TWILIGHT (3.5 stars): Kudos to the veteran writer/director for trying to break out of his accustomed style of domestic drama. I forget who said, ""The greater the success, the closer it verges on failure,"" but this is somehow the inverse of that. It is a failure that verges tantalizingly close to brilliance. TOKYO TWILIGHT is a movie with BIG PLOT POINTS, on a scale I do not recall seeing in any other Ozu film. The center of all the turmoil is Akiko (Ineko Arima), who is bereaved more than once, strives to pay gambling debts, is jilted, has an abortion, learns her ""dead"" mother is still alive, and is hit by a train. Arima's flat-footed portrayal of Akiko is what makes this worth watching, and it has close-ups of her that stayed in my mind's eye for weeks. Still, the film is testimony to the fact that in Ozu's world, the cataclysms that result from small human missteps are more interesting to watch than conventional, ""big"" dramatic contrivances. However skillfully done, it is the latter we find here.

EQUINOX FLOWER (5 stars): Of the five films on offer in this set, EQUINOX FLOWER and THE END OF SUMMER are the two whose pivotal characters are men. Tellingly, these two films also happen to be comedies. Wataru Hirayama (Shin Saburi) is a garrulous, masculine version of the quietly conflicted female characters played by Setsuko Hara in other Ozu films. Hirayama talks a good talk when it comes to encouraging young people to marry for love, but when it comes to his own daughter (Ineko Arima, again), he wants complete control--and sees no contradiction between his words and deeds. It is the perfect set-up for a comedy based on the interaction of those with vastly different assumptions. Ozu's comedies draw from our recognition of universal foibles, and this is one of his best. He makes us see exaggerated versions of ourselves and when we laugh, we are also quietly gaining self-awareness.

LATE AUTUMN (4.5 stars): Superficially, this is a remake of LATE SPRING, with a marriageable daughter reluctant to abandon her widowed mother, Akika (Setsuko Hara)--in the earlier film, the elder parent was a father. Still, the two works have different literary sources, and the shuffling and reshuffling of seemingly minor details is what propels the best of Ozu's work. Yoko Tsukasa, as Aya, the daughter, conveys her filial devotion and her sadness quite skillfully. However, she is not in an enviable position having to play opposite Hara, whose brilliance lies in playing both the surface and the subtext in such a way as to make us think we alone know her true mind. Ozu doesn't completely succeed in turning this ""mismatch"" to the film's advantage, since the actions of Aya are its lynchpin. What he does instead is pursue a strategy like that of EARLY SPRING. What seems to be a straightforward story about finding a match for a young woman becomes something much more profound--a treatise on how shared bereavement is sometimes more precious than young love.

THE END OF SUMMER (5): Only Ozu could create a delightful family comedy that ends with a shot of crows perching on gravestones. Where is Banpei Kohayagawa, the family patriarch, going when he excuses himself mid-sentence and struts happily out into the street? His family soon learns, to their great consternation, that he has resumed the same affair that had once disrupted their family when their late mother was alive. Michiyo Aratama, as Fumiko (the eldest daughter), turns in one of the great comic performances in all of Ozu. Here's a sample of dialogue. Hisao: ""At this point, Father's personality isn't going to change."" Fumiko: ""I'll yell at him until it does!"" This was Ozu's penultimate film, but in its light-hearted depiction of the natural continuum between life and death, it feels like it would have been perfect as his last word.

The late films of Ozu show the director leaning more in the direction of the needs of younger characters, and being more pliable in giving us scenes that are conventionally gratifying. He never panders in this respect, but instead holds out these moments as a loving gift. In the five films of this set, we see several successful examples of women's resistance to male-dominated values; we see a much more expansive definition of ""family""; and, we get a great deal more story exposition than we may be used to. Finally, we are privileged to see two things I don't recall in any other Ozu movie: a man getting down on his knees and happily helping with the housework, and a woman, destined to marry, actually dressed in full bridal array at movie's end.

Enjoy these now. If you wait for a perfect restoration of these movies, you may never see them, and that would be tragic.",1192838400,11,6272,4.817084493964717
2798650,5,B000OPPAF6,"Laughter and sorrow mingle in this Ozu film about a large family of five siblings and their aging father, a widower who resumes a relationship with a mistress from 20 years ago. Meanwhile, two of his unmarried daughters consider the future as both have suitors of their own, and the family business, a brewery, struggles to keep itself afloat and there's talk of a merger. Many things, as it happens, are coming to an end, not just the summer, of which we are reminded in scene after scene as characters fan themselves and each other. One senses also that the film records the end of traditional Japanese culture as it absorbs everything American - from western-style dress and English phrases, to Coca Cola, a sing-along to the tune of ""My Darling Clementine,"" and a young woman who seems to have walked straight out of a Gidget movie and wants a mink stole. The sun-washed colors are reminiscent of 1950s Hollywood.

Ozu's recognizable theatrical style is evident everywhere, as characters arrange themselves in carefully posed compositions or move in and out of the frame (often glimpsed through doorways) while the camera remains stationary and low to the floor. Sequences of scenes are separated by exterior shots of trees or narrow streets - like still photographs. A row of barrels lies tilted against a wall, each at exactly the same angle, two open umbrellas filling a space between them. In one memorable scene, a grandfather and his young grandson play a game of hide-and-seek, calling back and forth to each other, while the grandfather secretly changes clothes to make an escape from the house. It's Ozu at his best, a gently told story about life's intermingling of endings and new beginnings.",1191801600,19,1707,4.906574394463668

8186032,4,B000OPPAF6,"The End Of Summer merits 3 stars..  I've seen 3 Ozu films.  They are instantly recognizable as by Ozu, sharing his signature placement of bright red objects in the sets, the same lead actor, the outstanding cinematography, the fascinating customs, and intriguing situations.  Yet this film has much in common with soap operas: a philandering husband (with a wife and 3 legitimate daughters) who takes a mistress who doesn't know whether he is the father of her illegitimate daughter, efforts at matchmaking, suspicion, gossip, one man's spying on another, and much lying.  The first half of the movie is fast-moving and exciting; the second half is slow-moving and so boring that I fell asleep briefly about 10 times.  Watching this from six feet away--it has white subtitles usually on white backgrounds--it was impossible to read the dialogue without scanning back on the DVD dozens of times, a problem I solved by moving my chair to within 1 foot of the television screen.  The end shows people's varied reactions to the main character's sudden death: crying, laughing, gossiping, and stoicism.  Some of the daughters watch the smoke from their father's body as it is cremated--the smoke is rising from a tall chimney.  I speculate that The End Of Summer is a metaphor for the end of a happy life.
Equinox Flower deserves 4 stars.  It is set after WWII while the fathers of families want to follow the old traditions, such as dominating their families and arranging marriages for their children, causing conflicts with the children, who insist on marrying by their own choices, for love.  There's a surprising and delightful scene in which such a father is tricked into consenting to his daughter's choice of a husband.  The fathers gradually adapt to the new ways and learn to be happy for their children's choices.  Filmed in vibrant color, this movie has terrific cinematography.
Late Autumn is the best Ozu film I've seen yet.  Its story unfolds at a leisurely pace, and the film is primarily pensive, although there are a few humorous moments.  This film has the most transparent narrative of any Ozu film I've watched, making it easy to understand and appreciate.  Its theme is that life is simple, until people make it complicated.  The plot involves several attempts to pursue matchmaking, and it explores the personalities of the characters and their relationships to each other.  The film has more feeling than other Ozu movies, with a particularly poignant ending.  The unobtrusive background music is beautiful.  The is a five star film in my book.
In Tokyo Twilight, shot in b & w, Ozu uses corruption (gambling, prostitution, alcoholism, marital instability, and sexual profligacy) in 1950s Japanese society as a backdrop for a mysterious, dramatic story about how people's decisions and actions can have long-term and short-term tragic effects.  The moral is that children need both parents in order to thrive.  It is a long film meriting 4 1/2 stars.
Early Spring is a complex, long, gloomy film that starts slowly but develops into a story with variegated themes, characters and subplots.  The premise is that Sugiyama works as a salaried office worker in a company where all of his peers hate their jobs and are desperately unhappy, so they propose that one of them should have a fling to add some spice to life.  Sugiyama--a dissolute character--smokes, drinks heavily, gambles until his family is poor, treats his wife as though she were his slave, and has an affair with a co-worker who has a long history of promiscuity, which hurts his devoted wife deeply.  The most poignant scene is when Sugiyama visits his friend, Miura, a former co-worker who has been bed-ridden with a serious lung ailment for 100 days.  Miura rhapsodizes about his former company and job, and he only wishes to be healthy like Sugiyama, so that he could return to work.  Sugiyama takes his leave of Miura quickly, as Miura begs him to stay longer and says that Sugiyama's visit has brought him great joy.  Sugiyama has betrayed Miura by using alleged visits to Miura as an excuse to his wife for why he has been staying out all night, when in reality he has been with his girlfriend, Goldfish.  So Sugiyama betrays his wife, his friend, and his girlfriend, because he doesn't appreciate them.  There are several sentences of dialogue about the unhappiness, hopelessness, and loneliness of life, but there is a surprise ending of forgiveness and reconciliation that brings a terrific film to a satisfying conclusion.",1516924800,,4515,4.958831341301461
8186033,1,B000OPPAF6,"Ozu needs no thumbnail review, from me or from anyone else, and it would be sheer immmodesty on my part to offer one. He's a genius; his work creates new forms of artistic expression; he is sui generis. What part of that needs me to review it or him?  But this release cries out for one. It's such a shame that the bar is so low for art film transfers, that we're so overly grateful just to see anything at all on DVD or Blu-Ray, that Criterion can carry away the trophy as (get ready for it, you've heard it a million times already) ""the gold standard"" in doing it. It says a lot about the lowness of our standards. I just bought this set and sat down to watch ""Tokyo Twilight"" only to find.....wait for it.... that the image jittered and stuttered throughout from the first second of the live action (post-credits) material to the end title. And not just the ""fast motion"" sections, but everytime anyone in the fllm moved their lips, raised an arm, walked across a room, stood up, sat down, moved their head... the works. You get the picture? But wait, there's more: The jitter also included a slight audio lag and a pixillation or ""jump"" every single time there was a shot change (a cut) throughout the film. That's two or three hundred more jumps. You like those old jumpy, comical Keystone Kop silent movies? Well, this is a beautifully photographed, black-and-white 1957 sound film that will take you back to the jumpiness of a 1916 Chaplin one-reeler. What Criterion did, clearly did, was compress the video and audio so that much of the so-called digital ""information"" was left out. No, alas, Criterion is definitely not the ""gold standard,"" in this transfer or that of a hundred other titles, where even when the image and sound is not jumpy, jittery, and stuttery in this way, their pack-in booklets are embarrassingly badly written, generally by famous or unfamous know-nothings, and their ""bonus"" material is often close to worthless. Three cheers for celebrity endorsements. Three cheers for worthless commentary and misleading summaries. Is anyone there in charge of quality control? Does anyone there actually know anything about high-quality flim criticism and commentary? Are our standards so low that we are unable to see the truth about their releases and the supporting material they include? Based on the reviews I've read here and elsewhere more or less universally praising Criterion to the skies, I guess they are. We really don't know what intellectual and artistic quality looks or sounds like. So much the worse for us. We have a right to get better work than what Criterion does, especially for the prices they charge--heck we have a right to get better work than this even if they were giving the disks away for free. I wouldn't give away this disk to one of my students. It would only spoil the film for them. P.S. A few days later: I just watched another title in this collection, ""Early Spring,"" and encountered the same problem so it's not limited to the disk I first described.",1486857600,4,3011,4.724334600760456

8186039,5,B000OPPAF6,"Ozu Yasujir was one of the greatest film directors and after decades of obscurity outside Japan it is cause for celebration that so many of his films are now available on DVD and Blu-ray. Serious collectors will want to have all 36 of them, his greatness evidenced by a staggeringly high level of excellence throughout his output from his early silents to the final austere masterpieces. 5 of the latter are presented here in this region 1 Criterion box. As is customary with their Eclipse Series, the films are given a bare-bones presentation with no extras apart from short essays printed on the reverse of the covers included within each case. The prints are uniformly excellent and the mono sound good for the period. Some people have commented on how `flat' the color films look, but I can assure you that is how they are supposed to look - they look exactly the same as the prints shown on TV here in Japan and I doubt if the resolution can be improved upon. The lack of extras on the discs is offset by the cheap price making the box an obvious recommendation. Those wanting all of Ozu's films should note that the earlier works are only available on DVD courtesy of BFI who couple them with the very same films presented here by Criterion. Buy this box and you will have to duplicate titles to complete your collection. Just to clarify, here are the BFI releases which overlap with Criterion:

1. Late Autumn / A Mother Should be Loved (1934)
2. Equinox Flower / There was a Father (1942)
3. Tokyo Twilight / Early Spring / Woman of Tokyo (1933)
NB: The End of Summer is not listed by BFI and is only otherwise available through an expensive Artificial Eye disc. But BFI have said they will release all Ozu eventually, except for Floating Weeds (1959) which is already available on a wonderful print courtesy of Masters of Cinema.

If completeness is what you want (and you don't mind paying for it) I would recommend buying all the BFI discs and not going for this Criterion box. For those only interested in post-war Ozu however, this Criterion box is an essential purchase. The other key films from this period (Late Spring [1949], Early Summer [1951], Tokyo Story [1953], Good Morning [1958], Floating Weeds and An Autumn Afternoon [1962]) are all available separately through BFI with outstanding couplings of earlier films. As a footnote I should say I bought my Criterion box when I was in the States, having already picked up all the earlier films in a box here in Japan - an option only for those who can understand Japanese as obviously there are no English subtitles on the latter.

Before I turn to the films in more detail, as a long-term resident in Japan I'd like to offer a few insights into what makes Ozu special. He has been called `the most Japanese' of the great directors and of the `big three' I'd say this is true though Mizoguchi Kenji also has a strong claim. But where Mizoguchi's focus lies on `high' Japanese culture (folk tales, Kabuki theater, Nh drama, etc) Ozu's subject is everyday family life. His films reflect culture and attitudes that are unique to Japan which foreigners (I'm thinking of myself when I first arrived here 20 years ago) find opaque and difficult to comprehend. There is no doubt that the family is the central unit of Japanese society and Ozu's films are full of the feeling of maintaining `wa' (harmony) between family members and friends. Society here is anything but straightforward. Nothing is said or done directly. For example, in the Japanese language there are no words for `yes' or `no' and opinion-giving is frowned upon for fear of causing offence and it is the upholding of an agreeable `tatamae' (surface) which is the oil of Japanese social discourse. For this reason Ozu's films are full of (seemingly) mundane conversations about everyday things - the weather, basic greetings, conversation about superficial subjects and statements of the obvious. Family occasions and ceremonies assume central importance with funerals, weddings and commemoration rituals taking up so much of the narrative focus even if (through typical Ozu narrative ellipsis) they might not be shown. Japanese people generally avoid direct statement of emotions and foreigners not used to the country might find this odd and cold, but beneath the (for foreigners) bland surface harmony there is an ocean of deep emotion which is evidenced only obliquely, subtly and with great restraint. It is this feeling that lies at the heart of Ozu's universe. For those with the equipment to register it (Japanese people and those foreigners who understand their mentality) his films are extraordinarily moving. For those without, even if the technical achievements can still be grasped, the films may appear to be about nothing at all. This is the barrier preventing many from appreciating Ozu.

International producers were scared to release films which seemed only to appeal to insular Japanese tastes. In the 1950s when both Ozu and Mizoguchi were arguably at their height it was perhaps their misfortune to fall under the shadow of Kurosawa Akira, their younger `rival' who propelled Japanese cinema onto the world stage in 1950 by triumphing at Cannes with Rashomon. This was the first Japanese film most Americans and Europeans had ever seen and audiences of the time can be forgiven for assuming that Kurosawa's cinema was emblematic of Japanese culture as a whole, but looked at objectively we can see that influences on Kurosawa (ranging from Shakespeare to Dostoyevsky and from John Ford to Carl Theodor Dreyer) were fundamentally western. In fact his films have never sat easily with some Japanese people because of their bold metaphysical speculation where images and script are always aiming to `make a statement'. It's important to realize that this is fundamentally a western aesthetic and that a number of people in Japan accused Kurosawa (some still do) of intellectual snobbery and arrogance. The fact that after he left Toho studio in 1965 he had difficulty finding funds, ending up going to Russia to make Dersu Uzala and then making Kagemusha, Dreams and Ran with foreign money, shows how much he was ill-trusted in his home country. Contrast this with Ozu. Ozu was a life-long Shochiku company `salaryman', making only 3 of his 54 films away from that studio. From the time of The Brothers and Sisters of the Toda Family (1941) onwards he was considered a model of reliability in that he made shmin geki (domestic dramas) which made pots of money for Shochiku who were happy to let him use their best actors and technicians. Foreigners might see Ozu as an art house name, a director who made odd films of little interest to a wider audience. Actually, he was hugely popular in Japan, capturing great commercial success when he was alive. The artists that made up the Ozu family who always worked with him (writers Fushimi Akira, Ikeda Tadao and Noda Kgo; cameramen Yuharu Atsuta and Mohara Hideo; composers It Senji and Sait Kojun; actors Hara Setsuko, Iida Choko, Mitsui Koji, Miyake Kuniko, Sugimura Haruko, Ry Chish, Saburi Shin and others) all owe their careers to him and stay deeply loved by Japanese people to this day. Unlike Mizoguchi, Ozu showed indifference to whether he was accepted (or even distributed) overseas and remained content to make films about his favorite subjects, adopting reactionary techniques which seemed to contradict the norm at the time, but consequently now seem so modern with his achievements surely set to last.

From Late Spring (1949) onwards Ozu largely turns away from the working class settings which had dominated his pre-war work and focuses on the more affluent middle class. This was a conscious, if controversial decision made with screenwriter Noda Kgo to reflect the social transition taking place in post-war Japan. With it came an even more refined usage of the famous minimalist Ozu technique. This is rendered through the suppression of usual dramatic effect by the heavy usage of narrative ellipse, a camera that almost never moves, cutaway so-called `pillow shots' of buildings or nature which act as continuity links, precise `square' framing of images with a low camera looking up at characters (an aesthetic reflecting the interior design of Japanese houses and the screens and tatami straw mats which surround lives which take place mainly on the floor), and a tendency to shoot actors' faces full-on rather than using the over-the-shoulder, action-reaction approach of traditional Hollywood cinema. This puts the audience squarely in the film itself, a feeling alien to those weaned on the western norm.

The world of Ozu wasn't so different from the world of his Japanese audiences when his films were first released and the attendant themes involved (family conflict, social transition, a search for selflessness which is seldom found, the growing up process) reverberate strongly even in today's society in Japan. His films are simple, dedicated and reflect on the deepest of emotions in everyday life without resorting to intellectual bombast or camera trickery. Ozu's aesthetic is pure, subtle, refined and it is in this indirect appeal to our emotions that he shows his innate Japanese-ness. I have already said that Japanese people are not known for showing their emotions directly, but that does not mean they are not emotional. An Ozu film is a hugely emotional experience which is achieved as it were out of nothing. The biggest compliment you can give an actor, a writer or a director is where the mechanics of their craft disappear, and in an Ozu film everything seems effortless and completely natural. One would never know Ozu had prepared each scene meticulously at the script stage, had every camera set-up firmly in his head in advance and went on to demand absolute obedience to his complex preparations from everyone while shooting on set. In the 50s when Europe was about to be hit by a French New Wave of vibrant self-reflexive film-making, the reactionary Ozu was going in the opposite direction, crafting out exquisite family dramas where ticks and tropes of style don't exist. We are moved in a profound and quietly devastating manner which is really quite unique to him, though echoes of his style are to be found today in the films of Hou Hsiao Hsien and Kore-eda Hirokazu. In fact in a world where the films of Theo Angelopoulos, Abbas Kiarostami and Bla Tarr (other masters of the narrative ellipse who are often accused of obscurity) have found sympathetic audiences around the world perhaps the climate is now right for Ozu to be recognized everywhere as the master he really was.

NB: Work in progress. I will come back later and comment on each film individually. Until then I post here the basic release details:

EARLY SPRING (Sshun)
(Japan, 1956, 145 minutes, b/w, Mono, Japanese language - optional English subtitles, Original aspect ratio 1.33:1)
This was the first film Ozu made after an unusual 3-year lay-off following Tokyo Story and is somewhat different from his usual shmingeki style. Gone are parental authority figures and generation gap tensions. Partly on Shochiku's insistence Ozu deploys young and very popular actors in his tale of marital infidelity. Ikebe Ry plays Sugiyama Shji, a disillusioned office worker whose marriage to Masako (Awashima Chikage) has subsided into the same boring routine of his workplace. He is attracted to a typist in his company named `Goldfish' (Keiko Kishi) who responds to his advances. Their affair leads to inevitable marital conflict. Possible soap opera is rescued here by a combination of terrific acting (by the fine principals and the starry support cast of Ry Chish, Sugimura Haruko and Miyake Kuniko no less) and quietly understated technique which depicts all characters sympathetically. Ozu's aim here was clearly to examine the salary-man culture that evolved after the war and the crushing effects of the endless grind of routine - a routine making everyone victims of the economic miracle which was transforming Japan supposedly for the better. Ozu said, ""I wanted to portray what you might call the pathos of the white-collar life"". Atsuta Yuharu's camera is impressively static throughout while his director focuses on the ennui of daily life, eschewing almost all dramatic incident in the process. This ellipsis is very typical - we see nothing of the affair which is merely hinted at, audiences expected to fill in the gaps for themselves. This is Ozu's longest picture, his penultimate b/w work, and it may seem unsparingly gray sat between the enormous emotional charge of Tokyo Story and the bleak tragedy of Tokyo Twilight. On the other hand, as a document of Japan in the mid `50s and as an involving drama in its own right, it breaks new ground for the director and counts as one of his best films.

TOKYO TWILIGHT (Tky Boshoku)
(Japan, 1957, 141 minutes, b/w, Mono, Japanese language - optional English subtitles, Original aspect ratio 1.33:1)
This dark masterpiece shocked critics and audiences so much that few responded positively at the time to its release. It failed to reach the annual Kinema Junpo top ten list and performed badly at the box office - both unheard of for an Ozu feature. The director was reportedly dismayed at the reaction, but he would have been gratified to know that in recent years Tokyo Twilight has come into its own with more people correctly assessing the film's fine achievement even as it so radically departs from precedent. The only one to be set dead in winter, the film eschews quaint traditional Japan in favor of mahjong parlors, seedy bars, police desks, tacky izekaya and even an abortion clinic and instead of emphasis on family harmony, generational rift and the transience of all things, Ozu brazenly rubs our faces in mother-child neglect, marital hell, dysfunctional families, unwanted babies and finally just basic societal malfunction. Tokyo Twilight is still a shomingeki, but there is little harmony at home with patriarch Sugiyama Shukichi (Ry Chish) gamely trying to cope with his two daughters. The elder daughter Takako (Hara Setsuko) has been pushed by him into a loveless marriage with journalist Numata Yasuo (Shin Kinzo) and has brought her little child back to escape her husband's selfish anger. The second daughter Akiko (Arima Ineko) is coping with her unwanted pregnancy courtesy of wastrel student Kimura Kenji (Taura Masami) and suffers severe depression which neither her father nor her sister can understand. Into this woeful situation returns the absent mother Kimura Kisako (Yamada Isuzu) who had ran off with another man 20 years previously, deserting her family in the process. Described like this the film sounds like a soap opera, but as with Early Spring, it is anything but. Ozu's distanced and quietly understated style is the perfect counterpoint for the passions that rage through these characters to produce a masterpiece which is profound and shattering to the extreme. Small gestures lead to seismic emotional audience responses here. Watch the utter humiliation on the father's face when a colleague tells him in a pachinko parlor that Akiko has been borrowing money behind his back. Watch the desolation on Akiko's face when she returns from the clinic to be confronted by her sister's baby child. Watch how much profound desolation can be rendered simply by pointing the camera at the mother's bowed back after having been spurned by her daughter. And perhaps above all else watch how expertly Hara Setsuko can terrify with a stare. Watching this one can't help feeling that Ozu is here at last giving full voice to all the disgust that had been bottling up inside him for years. This film marked a rare instance of Ozu disagreeing with his trusted screenwriter Noda Kgo who fought against the over-emphatic darkness which envelops everything, but the director wasn't to be deterred from stating his intentions in the strongest possible terms. Despite what you might read elsewhere this film is not only one of Ozu's very best, but it is one of the best ever made period.

EQUINOX FLOWER (Higanbana)
(Japan, 1958, 118 minutes, Color, Mono, Japanese language - optional English subtitles, Original aspect ratio 1.33:1)
Ozu lightened up for his next film, a gentle comedy and his first color feature. Ozu had always been reactionary in the way he adopted new technology and just as he made his first sound feature in 1936 (The Only Son) virtually as if it were a silent film, he makes a sizable portion of Equinox Flower here as if it were still in the world of b/w. Color is used ingeniously to mirror the development of our central character, rich family patriarch Hirayama Wataru (Saburi Shin). He starts off proposing a toast at a wedding ceremony (one of the very few ceremonies shown in any Ozu film) to the new fashion of marrying according to romance rather than the established omiai system where husbands are found by the bride's parents. The occasion is a happy one and after the somber tones of Tokyo Twilight the garish colors are quite shocking. The film ends in a similar eruption of color in the aftermath of another wedding (check out those awesome bright orange Fanta bottles!), but in between as Hirayama's hypocrisy is explored (he advises others to marry for love while refusing to let his own daughter Setsuko (Arima Ineko) choose her own way), all color is drained out of the film so that it looks like a b/w feature after all, a point underlined by a bar scene where everyone wears gray and an English advert for `Black and White' whisky is displayed prominently on the wall. Ozu's only concession to Shochiku studio (who had high expectations of selling their new starlet Yamamoto Fujiko through `the first Ozu color film') is the jokey inclusion of red in every single shot. A reference to the blooming of the 'red spider lily' of the title, from the most garish of scarlet obi (kimono belts) to the simplest of red dots on an Asahi beer bottle the color is omnipresent throughout. Most obvious of all is the red kettle in the Hirayama home which keeps popping up incongruously as if to say `so what, is it really necessary to see that I am red?' Beyond the truly radical usage of color, the film (like Late Autumn, a Noda/Ozu adaptation of a Satomi Ton novel) is one of the most revealing of all Ozu's films about the mores of Japanese society. Another shomingeki, it explores generation conflict, this time coming down strongly on the side of the young generation. Great fun is had watching the ganko jiji (stubborn old man) vainly trying to lay down the law in a domestic environment which is really controled by the women, in this case his wife (played by Mizoguchi regular Tanaka Kuniyo) who together with Setsuko's friend (Yamamoto Fujiko) push him into final acquiescence. As much as the young are given their way though, Ozu is very careful to include scenes of quiet melancholy to the older generation mourning a society which is changing too rapidly for their liking - a drinking party at a hot spring (which features Ry Chish singing!) is particularly touching as well as the scenes of trains (always Ozu's metaphor for `the transience of all things') which book-end the film. Having experienced the hypocrisy of men like Hirayama myself and at the moment living a life under the cosh of quiet domestic tyranny (!) I can assure you the world Ozu paints in this film is absolutely genuine and still pertinent 60 years after it was made. It's a wonderful polished little gem enlivened by a roster of fine performances (Saburi and Tanaka especially) and Ozu's knack of making magic from everyday domestic mundaneness.

LATE AUTUMN (Akibiyori)

8186040,3,B000OPPAF6,"EARLY SPRING:  The Grim Reality of Corporate Foot Soldiers.

Film execution = barely four (4) stars; film historic relevance =  4.5 stars; restoration =  3.5 stars.  This is one co-writer's/director's conception of the dreary life faced by the lowest tiers of salary men and women (i.e., corporate clerks and clerk/typists) at the start of (mid 1950's) Japan's stunning post-war recovery.  The parallels between life in the military and life in post-war corporate Japan seem pretty obvious from several carefully staged shots at the start of the film.  Nevertheless, the director insists on hammering away at this similarity throughout the movie (in case there are some really slow-to-comprehend viewers?).  The cast is lead by a group of excellent actresses who occupy all the staring roles.  They uniformly deliver excellent line readings, and create the strongest impressions.  All male actors play de facto supporting roles.  Exteriors (real, not studio simulations) are numerous, and document many contemporary, ever-day activities in suburban and urban Japan.  By far these are the most fascinating scenes in the film.  This includes scary shots of scores of commuters jammed together waiting for trains and standing at the VERY EDGE of station platforms without protective barriers of any kind.  These are priceless views of continuing societal trust in the midst of momentous and far-from-popular cultural changes.  The film (as usual for this director) is much too long.  This time out the director surpasses himself with shots of clothes lines!  There are at least a dozen of them.  The usual shots of ugly overhead power lines are also present.  There are clever in-camera exterior shots using miniature high-rise building with each window showing the same inside activity.  You have seen most/all of the real building facades (photographed from the same angles) before.  Likewise for seaside location scenes.  Film ""score"" is chaotic, tedious, and usually inappropriate for (or disconnected from) what appears on screen.  The music basically distracts from rather than adds to the impact of the movie.  Happy music endlessly looped during a solemn wake is not particularly amusing!  And it is the exact same ripped-off Italian cinema music used in other films by this director.  Also if you are a huge fan of xylophones, then this film's music is for you!  Restoration including subtitles is not quit there.  Frame jitter occurs especially during the opening credits.  Subtitles (even ones with a few words) appear before the dialog is delivered (a frequent echo-like irritation).  None of the prominently photographed signs (on doors, buildings, etc.) are subtitled.  If you are a Japanese culture buff, then this is a must movie.  Otherwise, more on. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

TOKYO TWILIGHT:  An Interesting, Low-Keyed, But Prolonged Tragic Photoplay.

Film = three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  Unlike most films from this director, here is a movie you have NOT mostly seen before you actually see it!  This is mainly due to a plot that is uniquely divergent for this director (who is also a co-author of the script).  On the one hand, it is a refreshing relief from the usual over-the-top depiction of tragedy in many/most dramatic films of the era.  No over-blown emoting (except for the youngest lead actress), extensive distraught hand wringing or scenery eating.  On the other hand, the serene depiction of an extended family confronting life-changing misfortunes is unrealistically presented as essentially a ""business- as-usual,"" every-day occurrence.  The lectern is disguised, but the viewer can not escape the nuanced feeling of being lectured by the director on how financially well-off, contemporary Japanese families are supposed to confront and react to tragic events.  This is a movie that projects the director's opinion of how Japanese society should be, not how Japanese society necessarily was in the mid 1950's.  There is not much in the film that is new at the execution level.  As usual, there are no surprises, since the script telegraphs all forthcoming events.  Most of the director's filming techniques, trade-mark shots, and artifacts are the same as used ad nauseam in other films (except for the absence of clothes lines and the frequent substitution of ""side acting"" for ""back acting"" this time).  As usual, the film is much too long and dragged out.  Pretty much the same (outstanding) leading actors/actresses are in residence.  Studio sets have been recycled as usual: this family seems to live in the same house as all the other families seen in all the other director's films (complete with bell-ringing outside sliding doors).  All establishing shots are at worm's eye level which usually cuts the actors off at mid torso.  The schizophrenic film score is badly in need of a music editor to match music and themes with actors and scenes.  Music ranges from rip-offs of contemporary Italian movies (especially during the opening credits) to very light-weight Wagner.  To add to this sorry state, happy music often accomplices the depiction of somber screen moments.  Cinematography (black and white) consists of static shots using graying filters for real exteriors and an antique, narrow-screen format.  Subtitles are just right: they neither lag (nor lead) the clearly enunciated dialog delivery.  So in the final analysis what do we have?  A photoplay that is definitely worth watching and watching in its entirety, although surviving repeat viewings may prove beyond challenging.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

THE END OF SUMMER: Same Old, Same Old.

Film = barely three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  The many familiarities (repeatedly deployed in most of the director's prior films) presented yet again in this movie may have provided a sense of stability for audiences confronting dynamic societal changes in the 1960's.  All the actors you have seen (or will see) again and again as the director continued to turn out a de facto TV series consisting of about one episode/movie per season/year.  The producers and director seem to be counting on the viewer's curiosity as to what these fine and well-known actors are now up to for generating box-office traffic.  If the film had been cast with relative unknowns, it would likely have tanked (or never been made).  With so many characters crammed into this movie (it may have set a record at the time for the number of cameo appearances), it is a bit of a mystery as to who is related to whom and in what way in an expanded family consisting of 3/4 generations.  Not until close to the end can the viewer be absolutely certain.  The usual ""back acting"" (i.e., scenes filmed of the actor's back instead of from the front) frequently occurs.  Train whistles are patently phony: electric-powered trains are made to sound like steam engines (the trains are never seen).  Many exterior shots (or variations thereof) you have seen (and/or will see again) in other films from this director.  The same interior sets from many of the director's previous movies are used once more.  Cinematography (color) is fine (but the narrow-screen aspect ratio is still used).  Some editing cuts are a bit jagged.  Dialog, for the most part, is understandable.  Subtitles sometimes flash by too quickly and can be too long.  Film score blends in nicely except for the chanting prior to and during the death scenes which seems overdone.  Familiarity may have bred comfort 55 years ago, but today it borders on boredom. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

LATE AUTUMN:  More Of The Usual.

Film = barely three (3) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  A typical entry from this director minus shots of clothes lines and ugly overhead power lines.  Instead of woman acting as uninvited/interfering matchmakers, men assume this disrupting function. (Take just about any film previously made by this director, switch matchmaker gender roles, and you have the essence of the movie.)  Powerful performances by the leading actresses dominate the film with most trying mightily (but not especially convincingly) to appear many years younger than they are in reality.  They also provide some very funny line readings.  Performances delivered by lead male actors are dull, colorless, two dimensional, and de facto supporting roles.  The film is much too long with too many boring scenes and sequences.  Except for some exterior hiking scenes, the movie is studio bound.  Phony street scenes and interior sets (especially of bars) look the same as those seen in other films from this director.  Cinematography (color) is fine given the confines of being limited to static compositions and an old-time, narrow-screen aspect ratio.  Subtitles could greatly benefit from further professional editing of grammar.  They are often too long and gratuitous.  Music mostly consists of cloning from the director's other films.  A drug-free way for dealing with insomnia.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

EQUINOX FLOWER:  A Movie That Never Was.

Film = two (2) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  To paraphrase an old burger chain ad:  Where's the movie?  Notable actors are present (Kinuyo Tanaka delivers a particularly poignant wordless performance while the younger actresses tend toward hyper line readings).  So are the Director's trademarks including: scene padding; ""back acting""; clothes lines; ugly overhead electrical lines to power trains; and static camera.  The film score seems just right and is delivered in the right places on the sound track.  Cinematography (color) and sound are fine.  Subtitles are OK.  But the film lacks direction BIG time.  The Director conveys to the viewer the impression (rightly or wrongly) of having an astounding lack of interest in most of the scenes he is ostensively directing as well as the film as a whole!  Part of the problem seems to stem from a very weak story line and a lackluster script.  Set decoration is minimal.  Interior sets look terribly familiar and seem to have been little changed over the past 10 years or so.  Skip this one or be prepared to be seriously bored.  WILLIAM F.
