4449532,5,B004QO9H28,"I went to see the movie with modest expectations, especially since some reviews haven't been overly kind to it.  However, I as well as the 4 other people who saw it with me found it uproariously funny and sometimes even sweet.  I really enjoy Adam Sandler in most of his films, and although this is a comedy, in this role he also displayed his sweet side much like he did in the Wedding Singer.  He is actually a very good and expressive actor whose dramatic chops are underrated in many ways.  And of course, I am a huge fan of the wonderful Jennifer Aniston, and she did a superb job here.  There were also some other surprises....Brooklyn Decker was sweet, likable and relatable even beyond her obvious physical attributes.  Nicole Kidman showed up in a character who was a bit over the top, but being a huge fan of her as well, I enjoyed this turn as we don't get to see her do comedy that often.  Not every role needs to be deadly serious, after all.  She had a lot of fun with this one and she was great to watch.  Dave Matthews played her husband, and he was surprisingly good as well...perhaps he has a new career ahead of him in films.  The only character that was too over the top and a bit obnoxious was the fellow who played Adam's long-time friend.  Nothing about this guy was at all believable or particularly likable and you wanted to just swat him away as he was just downright silly and annoying, and he didn't really add much to the plot except as a necessary diversion device here and there.  The Hawaii scenery (a lot of it filmed around and in the Grand Wailea in Maui) was beautiful, of course.  I don't really want to get overly picky about this film.  It was not meant to be highbrow cinema, but it was consistently funny and very enjoyable, definitely a film I plan to buy when it is released on DVD. Go see it, you'll like it.",1297555200,91,1852,4.315028901734104
4449533,5,B004QO9H28,"This movie is HILARIOUS!!! Easy the best comedy I have seen in a long long time. Everything is really well done, and even though the ending is obvious as anything you just REALLY enjoy the ride. Kind of like life, you know the ending but you gotta know how you get there. If you don't see this movie, then I just pity you. You'd be missing out on something that is just great.

4449541,4,B004QO9H28,"I started watching on TV channel but hated the long commercials. The hubby suggested that I rent in on Amazon. So, I did. Cute story with some funny lines Great back ground in Hawaii. Seems Adam Sandler loves to go to Hawaii to film movies. A young doctor finds out that his bride to be didn't really want to marry him for him, just for the job he was going to be a heart surgeon. Take about gold digging tramp.  Then leaves and at a bar gets laid and decides to pretend he is married and having troubles with his wife, so he can continued to get laid.  The typical gotta lie to look good and to win whomever or whatever and brings in others to help them lie. One verse that Jennifer Aniston says. ""I've got to have note cards to keep up with all of your lies."" Or something to that effect. Funny though",1523577600,,803,4.141025641025641
4449542,5,B004QO9H28,"I really enjoyed the story, the acting is both hilarious and moving, and who doesn't love a good Adam Sandler movie, huh? Jennifer Aniston does a great job in this film. After her role on ""Friends"" it's difficult to picture her doing anything else, but she does an excellent job in this film and makes me want to see her in more roles like this one. Adam Sandler is one of my top favorite male actors of all time, and this movie has to be one of his best. A must have if you're an Adam Sandler fan.",1523404800,,498,4.091836734693878

Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Good God, this was terrible. It was so terrible, I almost have no words. But then again, since youve come to Hot Toasty Rag to read my review, Ill have to come up with something.

If you read the plot synopsis, it doesnt seem that bad. A man pretends hes a family man to avoid getting romantic commitments, but when he starts to fall in love, he has to put his money where his mouth is and come up with a family. Then the movie starts. And you soon wish it hadnt.

I don't know if Jennifer Aniston signed a terrible contract, or if she just has lousy taste in scripts, but if she doesnt make a good movie after this one, her career might come to a screeching halt. The entire movie feels like Adam Sandler did nothing but repeat the title to his cast before every take, encouraging them to improv the most unfunny, unlikable characters in history. This movie is so terrible, its an insult to place it among actual palatable films in the category of romantic comedies.

Ive previously revealed that Ill watch every Jennifer Aniston movie in the world; she is my It girl and my teenage idol. That being said, I didn't make it all the way through this movie. This is the only Jennifer Aniston movie Ive ever turned off. That should be a big enough Keep Out sign for you to see.",1497225600,,1332,4.273809523809524

4449635,2,B004QO9H28,"It would have been called a 'screwball comedy' in the 30's and 'sex comedy' in the 60's; it has the standard formula that starts with a deception that snowballs and requires telling ever more lies to cover up the previous ones, all to win the girl. When the formula works you don't question (or even stop to think about) the fact that people keep doing and saying things that only complicate and foul up the situation further; here, starting with Sandler's first lie, to explain to the girl he's fallen in love with why he has a wedding band in his pocket, instead of happily accepting his fumblingly stupid lie that is clearly only going to make things worse, I grimly sat in the theater asking why he didn't just say he found the ring on the street, he's holding it for a friend, it belonged to his late father, it--well, you get the idea. With a light, quick and fizzy tone and pace, you don't stop and think that way. And it happened every time a new lie was told that popped a new hole in the boat instead of plugging one: ""Why didn't he just say.."" etc. And when the movie veers off for stand-alone comedy bits unrelated to the plot, the effect is just as deadly. Groucho Marx could have pulled off the scene where Sandler's plastic surgeon is attending to a woman with a breast implant misfire, riffing and cracking jokes right in front of her; here, instead of laughing (no one else in the audience was either), I stared at the screen and wondered how a doctor could keep a practice going when he treats patients that way.

This was supposed to be Adam Sandler's foray into more 'mature' comedy, and maybe that was the problem. It might have worked better with his usual anarchic, childish dumbness. The movie gives us plot turns that don't make sense--that shouldn't have to--but acts as if they do. It doesn't skip from implausibility to implausibility; it keeps grinding to a stop and trying to make it all plausible. The funniest part of the movie is when Sandler, with the kids he's pretending are his, roughhouses playfully with them for the benefit of his dream girl on the other side of the door; when he knows she's not listening any more he casually tosses the kids off (onto the bed) Sandler's and the movie's timing is just right, there; but it doesn't have that off-hand, throwaway tone anywhere else. It's grimly strenuous, and again, makes us focus on things we shouldn't, including the underlying big hole: even if Sandler could maintain every deception in place, it could only work short-term--i.e., to get the girl into bed (the cliche Rock Hudson/Doris Day plot); but that happens the first night, and Sandler's in love and wants to marry her. How was he going to explain suddenly not having kids after the wedding he had before? Not to be repetitive, but I shouldn't have been asking myself things like this. And if the movie had been good I wouldn't have.",1492905600,,2884,4.5675675675675675

4449692,1,B004QO9H28,Wow! The scenery was beautiful and I wanted to love an easy breezy silly Adam Sandler flick but couldn't get past the misogyny. Constantly telling Aniston how old she is - which is ridiculous because she is an amazingly beautiful woman and must live in a gym. To removing a woman in a hula costume because she is too fat to compete. What is wrong with this movie is that it makes woman feel bad about themselves. Really a shame.

He and Aniston work really well together, like Hanks and Ryan, and would love to see them  together again down the line.  Bailey Madison is great as usual and give a high five to Dave Matthews along with the rest of the cast.

4450008,2,B004QO9H28,"Eh so so. I got this movie to replace the one I broke that belonged to the library! ( meaning I rented it from the library broke it then bought a replacement to give to the library) Adam Sandler is just not funny anymore to me. Maybe because I am getting older or something but his ""potty humor"" has lost it's appeal. Even though there are kids  featured in this movie, I don't think I would let my kid watch it. There are too many references to love making (I am putting it nicely) and the basic value's of the movie are not  there. Now I know  not every movie has to have a moral lesson but  for a few years now I only watch PG-13 or lower rating movies. The world may change it's standards as  to what is decent and good but I don't. As far as comedy goes ,there was nothing that made me laugh.",1452816000,,797,4.018987341772152

In short:
Adam Sandler is a successful Plastic Surgeon and Jennifer Aniston is his Medical and Office Assistant.  He asks her to pretend to be his ex-wife to help seduce the young lady he is in love with.  They all end up on a vacation to Hawaii with Adam, Jen, Adams love interest, and Jens 2 kids.  There Jen and Adam discover they are in love.

4450277,2,B004QO9H28,"I laughed once.  I enjoyed the Hawaii scenes because they were really beautiful.

The character of Palmer was ridiculously stupid. She just blindly believed every lie that was told to her, and the more ridiculous the lies were, the more she just smiled. What did she see in Danny, who was old enough to be her father?  There was no chemistry between them, and they had nothing in common. Danny obviously just wanted a pretty young woman, but Palmer was not as ""hot"" as they played her to be. I do believe that Katherine looked better, as well as the other women in the movie.  Katherine and Danny had chemistry from the very beginning, and it was obvious very early on how the movie would end. I did not think that Palmer looked 23, no matter how old the actual actress really was, she looked like she was in her 30s to me.  She was a teacher, so she should have had some kind of intelligence.  I found it amazing that she and everyone else, including the children, were suddenly free to go on vacation.  Why would any woman want to go on vacation with the ex-wife and children of the man that she supposedly was in love with, in a brand new relationship? Nothing bothered Palmer, she had no jealousies or insecurities, and even when the little girl called her a whore, she just smiled.

I didn't think that the two kids were cute at all.  They were just really annoying.  The constant endless lying in the movie got too be too much really early on, but when the kids were made to lie also, it was way too much.  What kind of a mother (Katherine) would do all of this lying and encourage her children to do it along with her?  The little boy was only six years old and the way that he was taught to lie was disgusting, and he obviously was so good at it that he manipulated everyone into a paid vacation to Hawaii.  There was one touching scene where the little boy cried when they were talking about what makes them sad.

Why all of the constant endless lying? Not to mention all of the money that Danny spent, from buying Katherine a whole new wardrobe and makeover to paying for everyone's vacation, including planes and hotels and dinners, and he even paid to bring the babysitter to Hawaii. All of this lying and spending money for a stupid woman who isn't even that good looking with no personality?  I kept wondering what Danny was going to do if they actually stayed together because no one could keep all of those lies going forever.  And what kind of a relationship could anyone have that is based on total lies?

I am obviously taking this movie too seriously, it was obviously supposed to be just funny, but I saw too much lying and meanness and disrespect between everyone (and everything about Devlin pushed it over the edge for me).

This movie was much too long.  Anyone with half a brain guessed that Danny and Katherine would end up together from the first scene, so don't even try to call this a spoiler.  There were too many ""poop"" jokes that just weren't funny, but disgusting and in bad taste, and I can't believe that I was supposed to laugh at a little boy sitting on the toilet while a grown man is sleeping in the bathtub.

Who could marry this guy? In a few years, he will be in a bar, telling women that he is married, and start having affairs and lying to everyone he meets, just like he did at the beginning of the movie, only this time, he will really be married.  He has no regard for women, based on how he treated them in the beginning, and how he treated Palmer with the constant lies. How could you marry a man who lies so easily? But then, Katherine also lies easily, and she teaches her children to do it, so the family of four should live happily ever after lying to each other all day, every day.

It annoyed me that, at the end, we see Palmer with a new guy, but we never get to see Palmer get dumped at the altar, and we never get to see Palmer getting told that every single word that Danny ever told her was a lie. The writers didn't bother to write those two major scenes which I was waiting for throughout the entire movie.

Major plot hole.. Danny and Palmer went to get married without ever applying for a marriage license. When applying for a marriage license, (1) you must list all previous marriages on the application, and so Danny would have to list the name of his fake ex-wife, which would be fraud, and (2) after getting the license, you have to wait 24 hours to have a wedding.

Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman's names were the only thing that kept this movie going, and that is the only reason that I watched it and finished it.",1438905600,2,4606,4.334109429569266

It's now ""our movie"" and he has suggested we watch it every wedding anniversary from now until forever.  And he is NOT a romantic person, or someone who likes romantic movies (or rom-coms).

4450689,4,B004QO9H28,The scenery is Breath taking it is so beautiful.  The Story is funny.  I watched this movie to see Bailey Madison she was really good in Cowgirls and Angels. And she is outstanding in this one too. I really think this movie is on the edge of PG 13 to R there is some Language and adult themes. But overall the scenery is A+ the acting is really good. If you do watch this with your kids have a discussion about lying. There is so much of it they have to use index cards. I didn't care for the Cousin's part at all. I would have edited out some of it and do with the mute button. We do watch it and could have paid for it already. The Grand kids like it. Some times you just need comic relief.  And chew the hay and spit out the stubble.,1417651200,,736,3.9261744966442955

4450798,4,B004QO9H28,"Possible spoilers............I really liked this movie.  Sandler and Aniston have great chemistry and are very funny together.  The kids were excellent too.  More often than not, kids in movies annoy me but these 2 were hilarious and their delivery was spot on.  I mean the pizza hut scene!!  I agree w/ another reviewer who said Sandler's character Danny was a little harsh with the kids and it played as just mean at times but it wasn't offensive to me or anything like that.  I took off 1 star because I wish they'd explored Danny and Katherine aka Devlin's relationship a bit more than they did.  I think they made their characters very believable, especially the scene by the hotel room door after the hilarious dinner with real Devlin and 'Ipod' Ian.  And can I say Nick Swardson was laugh out loud hilarious as Dolph.  I about lost it when he was on the phone with Palmer and Katherine forced him to ask her to dinner...""we...go...and get zeh dinnah tnight""  hahahahaha",1412035200,2,976,4.688235294117647

Adam and Jennifer did a good job with the lead roles, but I found the third girl to be far too ""blond"", not seeing some of what went on around here. Or perhaps she was just being polite because she did seem to have some good insights.

4451018,5,B004QO9H28,"For any man who has always wanted to find a true love, as well as the pain and suffering that manifests itself from a woman that did not see the quality guy you are, that made it so. Then, this is a really good movie about a traumatizing event, that becomes a fantasy unimagined in the beginning. However, the exploitation of the myth on how women would break a marriage, as well as the sincerity destroyed by a married man who should have been faithful --- were it to be realistic enough is over and above me, maybe not for others. Even though, I would have preferred the irony that comes with the pain an individual does to another, as a gain. I don't like knowing how close to the truth it is, only moments before we are about to make a commitment for life: that another would have about me in how they really feel before or at a marriage ceremony. I don't want the fantasy as much as it was more so given. Nevertheless, I say take it. Because in THE leverage on beautiful people or women, at least no woman can refuse even the most beastly of men when their heart is made of GOLD. A man with money though, is only a benefit the same.

This is the kind of movie that gives a romantic hope and the consequences of carelessness a woman would cause upon an innocent and humble man.",1396051200,,1281,4.228571428571429

The ""nose"" and ""sheep"" scenes are childish and poorly done. The ""gay"" scene is just awkwardly directed. Scenes with the kids and the lady in the pool are a little too rough for child viewers, but the young lady pretending to be British is smart and well acted for a child star.

The other female lead is very attractive, too! She is convincing in the part she plays and you can't help but like her. As for the other cast members, I could do without them... Sorry, but that's just my opinion and I'm sure you may have your own... It's kind of a date night film, but far from a classic.",1379203200,5,705,4.222222222222222

Just go with it and enjoy the great chemistry between Sandler and Aniston, as well as the other fun and funny characters.  It's silly, sweet, and just fun.  But there is a genuinely convincing chemistry between the main characters that fuels the movie.  I've seen mixed opinions of Sandler's sidekick played by Nick Swardson, but my wife and I thought he was hilarious.  Everyone seems to fit their parts well.  Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie yet, just go with it, relax and have fun.  Good fun summer romantic comedy.",1371340800,,605,4.704761904761905

4451163,5,B004QO9H28,"I used to love Adam Sandler's films for their goofy slob humor, but in the last decade or so his films have gotten very lazy and just don't seem to hit the right notes. 'Just Go For It' is a return to what we liked about Sandler in the first place. Jennifer Aniston and Sandler have good chemistry and well she is so beautiful to look at. This film has many laugh out loud moments and a sweet if predictable story.

If you liked The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates, then Just Go With It will be right up your alley, it is a return to Sandler's gentler side of corny romantic comedy rather then an obnoxious arrogant loser. Guys if it's movie night with your lady, pick this one up, she'll love it and there is plenty of T&A slob humor for you guys who can't stand Rom-Coms! ;-b",1366675200,,779,4.158940397350993

This movie looked awful when I saw the previews for it. I didn't even plan on watching it. But a friend brought it over one night and we gave it a try. We laughed throughout the whole movie. The actors were all great.  Aniston was amazing, and she and Kidman were fun to watch and truly hilarious at times! Sandler was funny as well, and as with most of his movies, was kind of an a$$ but had a soft side that obviously showed. The ending was a given but it was still fun to watch it all unfold. Really enjoyed this movie. As I said before, most of his movies look incredibly stupid, but if you give them a chance, you will almost always end up thoroughly enjoying them.",1365465600,2,812,4.205128205128205

This movie has that wonderful hallmark with all too many other D movie traits that plague so many flicks these days.  This has the wonderful stereotype characters that go nowhere beyond the most shallow thoughts and interactions.

It is also chucked full of bad acting that never generates any emotion for any of the cast involved.  Why do I care if Sandler lands the girl?  Why to I care what Jennifer contributes to the film at all?

Having watched many recent Adam Sandler films and having rewatched the old Sandler classics something is obviously missing of late.  Its not the actors either because he seems to cameo the living heck out of them.  The jokes are hacky and in the end you'd wished you'd watched a quality movie.",1363046400,2,829,4.554054054054054

4451358,4,B004QO9H28,"Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler make a pretty entertaining team. Even with an awful and predictable premise for a story, the two still entertain.

I find myself watching this movie often, just so I can laugh. Nicole Kidman plays quite the snob, and her performance certainly enhances the movie. The bellydancing coconut scene is my favorite piece of the movie.

The soundtrack is also pretty interesting, as it's purely smash-ups of various popular songs. The tone and energy of the movie is very well matched by the soundtrack.

Like I said, the story is more than unbelievable and could easily be resolved with a few short sentences of truth coming out of the mouth of Adam Sandler's character.

I'm an Adam Sandler fan. Not even Adam can save this movie. Nick Swarzmann is funny, but not in this movie. It was painful watching Dave Matthews and Nicole Kidman's superficial, haughty characters. Not funny.

Brooklyn Decker did a decent job considering she had no acting experience. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie.",1347408000,,575,4.627450980392157

What you see is what you get, no surprises, I can admit its a damn sight better than complete trash such as Little Nicky, Zohan, Mr, Deeds, Eight Crazy Nights and Jack & Jill combined, but still not really recommended for more than background noise as you do something else and certainly nowhere near as good as the wedding singer, happy gillmore or billy Madison.",1346371200,,654,4.598290598290598

4451390,3,B004QO9H28,"This would have been a pretty good movie... if only it had a plot! I like Adam Sandler. He is so funny. And this movie was funny. But random jokes and sight gags, while they amuse me, can't really make up for the fact that the movie on a whole was just plain dumb.

So Adam Sandler gets caught with his fake wedding ring by a girl he likes. I can understand why he would panic and lie about it. What I don't understand is why he would carry that lie to such an extreme if he actually cares about the girl. After all, he says this time the girl is different. It may be hard to admit you lied, but it's much harder to carry on a lie for the rest of your life. Duh! Did he really think she'd never find out? The most incredible part is the EXPENSE he went to to perpetuate his lies. Buying his assistant thousand dollar shoes so she can dress up when she meets the girl as his fake ex-wife. Paying her children to be his fake children. Taking them to Hawaii - first class - and staying in an $8000 a night suite! Sure, he's a doctor, but still. How does he get manipulated into going to Hawaii anyway? Because the kid says his ""dad"" broke a promise. His girlfriend says, ""how could you?"" So off they go. He still could have continued his lies by saying, ""um, no, I never promised that."" Geez. So, where do I find a guy who spends all this money to impress me? Truthfully, preferably.

The saddest part is I still have to give it 3 stars because so many movies are just worse. And this was not trash. It just didn't make a lot of sense.",1333238400,,1532,4.069536423841059
4451391,5,B004QO9H28,"Once more, Adam Sandler delivers an outrageously funny romantic comedy, Just Go With It. 2011 in short was a horrible year for Mr Sandler, producing movies that are considered to be some of the worst maybe ever made: The Zookeeper, Bucky Larson, and Jack and Jill. But out of all that, he does have one thing to be happy about, his February hit, Just Go With It.

Sandler, Brooklyn Decker, and Jennifer Aniston, deliver stellar performances in this classic Hawaii set comedy. Dave Mathews and Razzie nominated Nicole Kidman,(nominated for her performance as Devlin, in this movie,) are the very funny snobbish couple, along with Bucky Larson star Nick Swardson who is also quite hilarious in this movie as Sandler's cousin. But the two surprising performances come from Bailee Madison and Griffen Cluck, who play Aniston's funny children. Adam Sandler plays Danny Maccabee, a successful plastic surgeon that carries around a wedding ring as his pitch for a one night stand every Friday, until one night he meets, ""The One,"" played by Brooklyn Decker,but of course his ring comes and bites him in the butt. Adam Sandler seeks advice from his personal secretary, Katherin(Aniston.) Then the fun begins, and the lies pour on.

There are of course situations in this movie that Mr. Critic saw and said, ""Nope, can't happen."" But we all no, Mr Critic can't enjoy movies, so don't disregard these ""not possible"" situations, but make sure you know, your watching an Adam Sandler comedy. Movies aren't supposed to portray life, but just make it look better almost. So push away reality for an hour or two, and enjoy this hilarious Happy Madison production.",1331424000,,1648,4.967391304347826

4451397,4,B004QO9H28,"Not that I've broken it down in exact mathematics, but I wager that Adam Sandler is batting about .25 in his film career. Meaning that every fourth film he churns out doesn't actually hurt to watch. For every good WATERBOY, THE WEDDING SINGER, and 50 FIRST DATES, there are, four times over, grotesque head scratchers like JACK & JILL, LITTLE NICKY, and YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN. Which brings us to JUST GO WITH IT, which I'm actually going to rate as an above-average romantic comedy, 3 (maybe 3.5) out of 5 stars' worth. JUST GO WITH IT is loosely adapted from the 1969 classic CACTUS FLOWER, and maybe imitation isn't the best form of flattery. This remake isn't quite as good.

At least there's the stunning Brooklyn Decker to make googoo eyes at. Sandler plays 40-something Danny Maccabee, a talented plastic surgeon who once had his heart broken and now routinely prowls on them naive hotties. Danny is an average-looking schmoe and so has to rely on his fake wedding ring and made-up bad marriage to gain sympathy and interest from the ladies. It's pretty underhanded, yeah, and it's hard to swallow the gullibility of his marks. It's as if you say, ""Hey, look at the dead birds!"" And these girls look up.

When he meets lovely 6th grade math teacher Palmer (Decker) and they spend a night on the beach, the smitten Danny believes she might be the one. But surface now, you complications. Palmer finds the wedding ring in Danny's jeans pocket. A scrambling Danny claims that, yes, he is married but that his divorce is almost final. A doubting Palmer demands to meet the wife. Palmer is the kind of girl that when you say ""Look at the dead bird"" she will look at the ground.

Here's Jennifer Aniston who plays Katherine, Danny's loyal, bespectacled nurse assistant and single mother of two, and it's not at all a stretch that Danny would approach her to pose as his estranged wife. Of course, she agrees. Of course, she meets Palmer and inadvertently lets drop that she has two kids. Palmer, who adores kids, now wants to meet the kids. Somehow, this party of pretense relocates to a weekend in Hawaii. Along the way, Danny's cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson) invites himself and passes himself off as Katherine's fianc ""Dolph Lundgren."" And this Dolph Lundgren happens to have a Colonel Klink German accent and is into sheep husbandry or something ovine-related, anyway. This, thinks Sandler, is brilliant farce.

Honestly, no one but Paul Rudd and John Cusack should be doing this sort of mildly risque romantic comedy. Sandler, Jack Black, and Seth Rogen are on a whole different and subservient level. I don't think JUST GO WITH IT is all that bad, considering. But maybe that's just the inner frat boy talking. There's a sweetness in this film that's trying to get out. The gags aren't nearly gross enough to threaten Apatow's self-esteem. Sandler does tone down his shtick, and that's good. Aniston is engaged and amused, but she isn't given any good lines to work with. But her being there rights the ship some. Brooklyn Decker also isn't given much to do other than be nice and wholesome and naturally sexy, and one wonders how she would've fared had the writers written her a more subversive role. But there are enough laughs. I got a big chuckle out of Rachel Dratch's patient with the roaming eyebrow and Kevin Nealon's guy whose face is BOTOXed to the max. Expect other juvenile sight gags such as mismatched fun bags and huge honking schnozzes and, this being a Sandler vehicle, some potty humor. Nicole Kidman is game as Aniston's competitive sorority rival and Dave Matthews is here acting instead of creating music. Dave Matthews' character supposedly invented the iPod. As you can see, in this movie, lie builds upon lie. It's like the Jenga of deceit.

4451449,4,B004QO9H28,"This was a very welcomed surprise.  Instead of constantly shooting for awkwardly un-funny off-color remarks, one after the other, or just merely yelling at everyone all the time, Adam Sandler and company crafted a nicely woven film that is sweet, smart and funny.  This has a LOT to do with the fact that Jennifer Aniston is flawless here.  Sandler is apparently the type of guy that needs a strong woman at his side in order to anchor his films.  When he relies on his fellow male comedians his films fall to pieces, but his collaborations with the likes of Drew Barrymore and now Aniston have proven that his over-the-topness can be tamed by the fairer sex.

In `Just Go With It', Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who had his heart trampled on when he was younger and has vowed to never get married.  When he discovered that drunk women tend to react kindly (and often passionately) to a married man with a horrible wife he started wearing a wedding ring and spewing sob stories to pick up chicks.  Then he meets a bombshell and falls, instantly, in love with her.  He doesn't even want to lie to her because after one magical evening in the sand the two decide that this could be something `real'.  But then she finds his fake wedding ring in his pant pocket and he has to come up with some sort of lie in order to keep her interested in him, so he convinces his assistant to pretend to be his `soon to be ex' wife, and then suddenly her kids become his kids and his cousin becomes her new lover and they all wind up in Hawaii where things just spiral out of control until...

Well, I'm sure you'll figure out within the first few minutes who is going to wind up with who.

So, this film is swimming in chemistry.  That is one thing that really made this so worth watching.  Adam Sandler tones down his crudeness in order to keep up with the classy humor surrounding Aniston.  She is a total star here, and really, it's shocking to say that this is one of her finer performances.  I just loved the way she sunk into the `genre' without losing a sense of realism.  She is sharp and witty and aggressive, yet you always can see the subtle lines of longing in her eyes; that longing for normalcy in happiness.  Swardson is hilarious with an accent (and that sheep scene is priceless), Kidman is insanely manic, but in a good way, Bailee Madison is adoreable and has deft comedic timing that I'm sure she'll hone well.  Brooklyn has spotty moments of green acting, and then she recovers, but she's not hot enough to persuade eyes away from Aniston, who is a knockout here.

Best I've ever seen her.

At the end of the day, this is a predictable romp (and the ending is lazily put together in a rush attempt to tie up all loose strings), but it's heartwarming and quite funny.  In fact, I laughed from beginning to end, and they were genuine laughs that I'm anxious to revisit!",1319414400,5,2874,4.415559772296016

4451453,4,B004QO9H28,"A tale about a guy, Adam Sandler, who gets ""dumped"" by his fiance' at an early age and therefore decides to pretend to be married to get the attentions of women in the bedroom. Years later he's a plastic surgeon and he runs into a blonde bombshell, Brooklyn Decker,  who he determines is his destiny but she catches him with a ring so he fabricates a story that he's divorcing his wife and needs his secretary, Jennifer Aniston, to play the image with her children.
What happens is more and more complications with some good humor and some off humor. The highlights of this tale are fairly well developed characters, especially for a romantic comedy. Brooklyn Decker's character is far from an airhead and has legitimate reasons for wanting to meet the ex wife before she gets serious with the Sandler character. The Hawaiian face off between Aniston and her sorority arch rival, played by Nicole Kidman, is one of the best scenes. But the best supporting character is played by the daughter of Aniston, a wanna be actress who does a low end British accent and has some of the best lines. The ending is predictable but pretty much what the audience wants so we're to blame for it. Dave Matthews has a small role as the make believe guy who invented the IPod. HUMOR: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday. BEST DIALOGUE: Eddie: What are you doing later?

'Just Go For It' is a return to what we liked about Sandler in the first place. Jennifer Aniston and Sandler have good chemistry and well she is so beautiful to look at. This film has many laugh out loud moments and a sweet if predictable story.

If you liked The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates, then Just Go With It will be right up your alley, it is a return to Sandler's gentler side of corny romantic comedy rather then an obnoxious arrogant loser.

4451504,4,B004QO9H28,"I have been a big fan of comedy movies, and this movie fits right up there as a decent comedy movie. There are negative reviews on the movie, and depending on how you see it, the movie can be spectacular or a drag. The basic storyline starts with a hapless unmarried man (Adam Sandler) trying to impress a girl (Brooklyn Decker) at a party. We've all seen it before. The unmarried man goes through a series of lies, and the plot unravels from there. It's not a good way to get that date or start a relationship by lying in the real world, but this is how the movie builds itself up. Nick Swardson is a funny man, and with this movie, he kind of became the focal point of the movie stealing the comical moments from Sandler in my opinion. Jennifer Aniston looked great, and the children responded to the roles given although a little too snobbish. Kidman represented well as a competitor to Aniston in the movie, and for every guy's dream, you see Brooklyn Decker being the pretty face in such comedy movies, and don't be surprised to hear that guys only watch this movie just to see her face. Overall, this is a nice movie to watch on a rainy day or to pass the time. Due to the sexual references and its snobbish behavior that the children plays, the movie is reserved for adults only. I give it four stars because of the characters in the movie and the occasional funny moments, but I wouldn't expect it to be a movie that gets a big ovation due to its storyline.",1315008000,,1465,4.330909090909091

For one thing, this movie is about as sleazy as they come--everyone is constantly making crude remarks, but it isn't even interesting or funny.  Everyone is sleeping with everyone and cheating on each other, kids are rude and out of control, and I felt embarrassed for the characters a lot.

Add some peurile humor, and a ridiculous character that next to anyone would make that person look good (usually Adam Sandler is the one who looks good). . . and there you have it.

I won't spoil it for you, but you know from the start how this film will end. It mixes the Adam Sandler formula with the romantic comedy formula . . . you know . . . blossoming relationship, conflict, then resolution/happily-ever-after.

4451522,2,B004QO9H28,"I watched it with high expectations. I've been a fan of Adam Sandler since his days on MTV's Remote Control. I watched him mature as an actor and as a comedian. I've defended him when my high-brow friends friends dismissed him out of turn. I really expected to like this film, but it fell short.

I'm not bashing him, or anyone else in the film. It had all the ingredients to be hilarious. It was obvious that the people on the set had a lot of fun, and that much care was given in establishing all of the shots. But still... I kept wishing that I was laughing, but somehow, it simply wasn't very funny. The little girl with the fake accent? This was a decent prop, and yet it was as if Sandler was just letting the camera roll while she did her shpeel. There were many times when it seemed that Anniston was just going along for the ride, but nobody was driving the vehicle. His annoying cousin (which should have been a reliable comic-relief, and the more absurd the better) just didn't deliver the laughs I wanted.

Honestly, I like Adam Sandler, and I've consistently found his films to be very enjoyable escapes. (Except for Little Nicky, but ...I mean come on. That one really was a stinker. I think even Adam would admit that, if he hasn't already.) I expect to be entertained by his films in the future. And I'm honestly puzzled as to why this one just didn't deliver (in, I admit, just my opinion). I was watching it, after a while, and seeing how much effort went into it. I was noticing how the actors were all on their marks. Nobody was stepping on someone else's lines. Nobody was missing theirs. But time after time, it seemed that Sandler was just ""letting the camera roll"" and hoping that the person or people in front of it would capture what he was after. And I just don't think that they did.

Maybe with some more editing? I don't know. But I can't give this one a very high rating. Sorry.",1313712000,,1909,4.356741573033708

4451539,4,B004QO9H28,"I had no intention of seeing this film, until it was recommended by a friend whose tastes are generally similar to mine. I had yet to see an Adam Sandler movie that was even tolerable, but, not quite able to fully shake my misgivings, I rented it anyway. And I was glad I did -- this was a good film.

Now, as can be expected of a Sandler film, there is a lot of bathroom humor, crude sexual humor, and stupidity. However, unlike most Sandler films, those instances do not outweigh the actually amusing, well done, and interesting moments. Surprise, right?

The story follows an ugly kid who is engaged to (he thinks) the love of his life; at the last moment, he hears her voicing her true opinion of him (it's not flattering). So, the engagement is off; and off to a bar he heads to drown his sorrows and mope over his ring. Until the image of a lonely married guy draws the attention of a pretty woman. This sets Sandler on a new path in life -- chasing girls while selling all manner of sob stories.

Everything is going well, until he meets someone who is more than just a pretty face and a new conquest...and she finds the fake ring he uses to sell his married life sob stories. This sets him on a roller coaster ride in which he ropes his assistant (Anniston) into playing his soon-to-be-ex wife -- and then her kids, as his kids.

Of course, everything falls apart when he and Anniston start developing feelings for each other -- or, rather, recognizing their feelings for one another.

Predictable? Yes. Improbable? Absolutely. Funny? Heck yeah. There are enough amusing characters, funny scenarios, and ridiculous antics to make this an interesting, fun film...and to outweigh the less than stellar, typical Sandler moments.

If you like typical Sandler films, you might not care for this one; otherwise, you might get a kick out of ""Just Go With It"".

All in all, I'd give this a 4/5...perhaps more generous than it deserves, but it's such a rare treat to find a decent Sandler movie, why not?",1312761600,,2003,4.5472222222222225
4451540,5,B004QO9H28,"This review is for everyone who wrote ""serious"" reviews on other forums and here who  hated the movie. They take themselves way to seriously!  I usually don't like  Adam Sandler movies - too inane  - but I found this one to be hilarious. I've read some reviews that were scathing by ""feminists"" who found it revolting. But I'm a semi-feminist, liberal, female,  nearly senior citizen, very happily married who has fought for and worked in ""manly"" jobs. So I live like a feminist but enjoy being a female. I found this the perfect escapist movie. It was fun, fluffy and picturesque. And clever. Warning spoiler alerts! Come on -how could you not find ""sheep shipper"" and ""stand with the dolphins"" funny? And giving Heimlilch to the sheep and having him spit out a rubber toy? I laughed really hard- and I usually don't. And the women were stunning works of living art, how can you not enjoy pretty women? The kids were clever, conniving sorts who you had to admire for their ability to manipulate, but deep down good kids and sure the adults were over the top but fun.  Sure the plot was implausible and yeah, I thought they were mean to the fattie women in the hula show but having worked in the tourist industry here I found the send up on the tourist industry hilarious. Maybe I enjoyed it so much because I live in Hawaii, have done ""pet herding"" of sheep with my border collie so roared at the sheep scenes, have worked to protect dolphins so enjoyed the scene of them cavorting off shore (quick but it was there), laughed at the ""swim-with dolphin"" yearnings of the boy only to find out he cannot swim, have been around enough superficial folks  to recognize the well drawn spoofs of them, as well as been amused by ""womanizing"" but basically kind hearted guys who are older but always have younger women falling for them (for real!) to find it all amusing. I enjoyed the spoofs on relationships, folks crazy enough to have pet sheep (and I have friends who do!) and the send-off on the tourist industry. Sure it was implausible but haven't we all known folks who were a bit like each of these characters? No? Then you need to get out more. LOL!

It's a testament to the boredom  of the flight that I kept turning back to this piece of dreck. Sound on or sound off, it was dopey and predictable.

Sandler plays a plastic surgeon with a huge honker who learns on his wedding day that his bride just wants to marry him for his money. Heartbroken, he bolts the wedding. While boozing away his troubles at a bar, he stumbles unto the secret for getting sympathy sex - use his wedding ring to tell sad stories about his ""wife."" But when he finds a girl who he really likes, the ring becomes a problem. He enlists office assistant Jennifer Aniston to pretend she is the hot harpy of a wife he is on the brink of divorcing. Cute premise...

...but lousy execution. Sandler just goes through the motions, making me wonder what any girl, never mind a babe-olicious one, would see in him. And the plot, once you realize where it is going, becomes clichd and predictable.

I guess $80 million doesn't go too far anymore (IMDB estimate).

The 60s movie is called ""Cactus Flower"", and Goldie Hawn won an Oscar that year for her role.  If you like ""Just Go With It"", I recommend that you check that one out too.  For me, ""Cactus Flower"" has way too much 60s cornball slapstick/nonsense in it- but it definitely had some brilliant moments too.

4451577,4,B004QO9H28,"This film reminded me how funny both Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler can be - neither has been in a film lately that really showcased that. Aniston really is a brilliant comedic actress, I think that gets lost sometimes in discussions of her. Her timing and facial expressions are excellent, and in the first half of this film especially, I thought she put that to good use and was very funny (and lifted Sandler up too - his humor is not usually my style.)

The basic plot (as has already been described in other reviews) is that she has worked as the long-time office manager to Adam Sandler's plastic surgeon, and knows him better than anyone else. He's a player who wears a wedding ring to bars and tells girls sad stories of his mean (fake) wife to seduce them. A stupid plot yes, but that's true of most rom-coms, so personally I forgave it. The twist comes when he meets a girl he actually thinks he wants to be with long-term, and has to somehow work through his lie. He asks Aniston to play his soon-to-be ex-wife, and from there all sorts of ridiculous chaos and misunderstandings ensue.

Aniston and Sandler are the heart of the film, and as I said, I think they are great together in the first half, when they are playing off each other to pull off this duplicity. As the film turns more romantic, their chemistry isn't quite as strong, but there are still some great moments. Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews (not sure how that came about) cameo, and have some funny moments also. There's plenty of jokes that fall flat, and the plot is of course absurd, but overall, this gave me 4-stars worth of laughs.",1310947200,,1619,4.503401360544218

4451609,3,B004QO9H28,"This movie is about lies, lies, lies and even more lies. As the lies start extending and extending, of course the story get more jokey. Adam Sandler takes on his typical acting M.O. (modus operandi) and that is: start off like a loser and eventually end up as the real winner.

This is quite obvious at the start where they give him this huge nose and his bride to be, just seems to be with him for the  luxuries that money can buy. Luckily he over hears her true motives and decides not to get married.

However, after some cosmetic surgery, instead of looking for a genuine relationship after the first misfortune, he decides to become a 'player' and uses women, but tells them upfront that he's married to a beast and just needs some TLC for the night. So really he is just as bad as the woman that he almost married.

As the film goes along he plays a very well endowed woman, and then discovers that he is in love (or is that lust) with her. But when she finds his fake wedding ring, he has to construct a whole scenario to ensure that he does not lose her.

The long and short of it is that it is a funny show, but because Sandler has done these loser/success roles so often that it is extremely predictable...",1310774400,2,1216,4.269565217391304

This movie is funny, the scenery changes often, so it definitely doesn't have a monotone plot like a lot of the newer movies.  The only thing about this movie that bothers me, is the 'girlfriend'.  Correct me if I'm wrong here, but Palmer, 'the girlfriend', seems really pushy in this movie.  Her personality doesn't match her actions.  There are many parts of this movie where you want to say 'why wouldn't they do this', or 'why wouldn't he just say that as a cover'.  There are so many parts that are so outrageous, and you think 'theres just no way'.. but on the other hand, I think that's what made it so cute and hilarious.  So, long story short, a lot of it is unrealistic, but who cares- its a movie, and a good one at that.  Watch it.. buy it, and I'm sure you'll be glad you did.",1310688000,,929,4.293103448275862

4451614,1,B004QO9H28,"I'm not usually that critical of Adam Sandler movies.  You know what you're getting, and what you usually get is reasonably amusing, somewhat crude, and oddly sweet.  Just Go With It made me almost laugh once, cringe repeatedly, and wonder what is wrong with the people who put this movie together.

Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who pretends to be married to get laid.  He meets Palmer, who is attractive but not as hot as the movie makes her out to be, not very smart, and for some reason attracted to Adam Sandler.  Aniston plays Sandler's assistant, a single mother with two children, who gets roped into pretending to be Sandler's soon to be ex-wife.

The biggest problem with this movie is that Sandler's character was completely unlikeable.  The guy was a huge scumbag, actually.  The way he treated women was horrible, but the way he treated the kids was often worse.  He was supposed to have an underlying heart of gold, but it didn't really come through.  The scene in which he taught the boy to swim was nice, but it came shortly after a scene in which he shoved the girl down into mud.  It was hard to see what any woman saw in him, aside from his ability to pay for things.  Aniston was fine, though at times her attempts at comedy seemed to involve her channeling the ghost of Walter Matthau in terms of phrasing and timing.  The movie had a great many scenes where it seemed like the cast was making it up as they went along, and it was more awkward than funny.  Add to that repeated gratuitous shots of Brooklyn Decker's body, which just made me feel embarrassed for her, because seemed so much like she was just in the movie to provide a pretty backdrop.  The plot holes aren't even worth mentioning, though this was another movie where you were amazed and frustrated by the characters' inability to lie with a modicum of intelligence.

In addition, Nicole Kidman is at her FUNNIEST role ever! I LOVED her role! She is perfect for comedies! It's a complete different style for what she is used doing! Just for Nicole's acting is worth seeing this movie!

In this he continues to lie after he meets a girl he really cares about and has the perfect opportunity to tell her the truth. Instead he continues to pile lie on top of lie, dragging his assistant and her two less than charming children into it, but I guess that was the only way the writers could think of to make the story continue so that they could make the movie. The shopping scene to get a makeover for Jennifer is a ripoff from ""Pretty Woman"" I noticed that they threw in Hawaii just to try to make it more interesting and that's another rip off of ""50 First Dates"" which was filmed there. I guess Sandler just wanted to go to Hawaii again. Well, he should have just taken a vacation there. I'm very surprised that Jennifer Anniston ever agreed to be in this totally classless movie.

4451790,4,B004QO9H28,"This movie is pretty funny, despite the horrible reviews. I think this is a good movie and surprisingly Aniston and Sandler have chemistry- think mature chemistry. One of the funniest characters in this is Katherine's kid Michael (Griffin Gluck). Griffin Gluck had some laugh-out-loud lines which he delivered masterfully and comically. He's definitely a kid to watch.

PLOT: This film is loosely based on the 1969 movie Cactus Flower. It's a silly romantic comedy. Sandler who plays Danny Maccabee is a successful plastic surgeon in Los Angeles who feigns an unhappy marriage to get women, after having been heartbroken on his wedding day 20 years ago. The only woman aware of this is his office manager Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Aniston), a divorced mother of two. At a party, Danny meets Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a sixth grade math teacher, without his wedding ring on, and they have a romantic night together. The next morning, she ends up finding the ring in his pocket and she assumes he was hiding the fact he was married. She refuses to date him because her parents divorced because of  adultery.

Danny goes to Palmer's school to try to get Palmer back. Instead of telling her the truth, he tells her that he is getting divorced from a woman named Devlin, named after Devlin Adams, whom his office manager, Katherine had mentioned was an old college sorority nememis.  Palmer then wants to meet Devlin, and Danny agrees. Danny asks Katherine to pose as his soon to be ex-wife for him, and they go shopping on Rodeo Drive to buy her clothes so she can look like a trophy wife. At a hotel having drinks, Danny and Palmer are greeted by a made-over Katherine, who gives them her blessing. However, after hearing Katherine talking on the phone with her kids, Palmer assumes that her kids are Danny's as well, which Danny goes along with. Danny then privately meets with Katherine's kids, Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin Gluck), to get them to play along. Initially Katherine is furious, but she reluctantly agrees.

From there, they the lies get bigger and more over the top... and as you can imagine. Pretty funny movie but, not cinematic mastery by any means. Just a fun movie to watch on a Friday night with your loved one to have a few laughs.",1307750400,,2267,4.78772378516624

Of course Brooklyn Decker is there, not for her acting, but for her looks. It could have been any other pretty girls in the acting business, but for her debut, Decker actually pulled her part very well. But the pinnacle of this movie, I thought, was Nick Swardson, he is the only character that I laughed at.

After getting Katherine (Aniston) to go along with it they all end up in Hawaii where things get complicated.  After movies like ""Bedtime Stories"" and ""Click"" it seemed like Sandler was starting to move away from what makes him funny. ""Grown-ups"" was good, but that seemed more like friends having fun then a movie.  This movie is closer to the humor in ""Big Daddy"" then any other movie he has done recently.  While still a pretty soft PG13 Sandler, this movie is actually very, very funny.  Nowhere near the days of ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Billy Madison"", Sandler is slowly trying to capture his younger days, and with this and ""Grown-ups"" he is getting close.  The chemistry between Sandler and Aniston is perfect and I would not be surprised to see them in more movies together.  Very, very entertaining and funny.  A good laid back comedy that holds the funny all the way through, unlike movies like ""The Dilemma"" which is funny, but turns serious at the end.  Overall a very funny movie that will not dissapoint. I give it a B+.

He discovers his bride to be had a fling with her former bf right before the wedding and she is just marrying him for his money. Danny is depressed as he sits in a bar with his wedding ring on. He discovers the ring is a chick magnet that leads to numerous one night stands. He calls it ""my precious."" Jennifer Anniston plays his single receptionist with 2 children. At a party, Danny meets a Barbie Doll school teacher and has a great night. He wasn't wearing his ring, but then she discovers it! You cad! Danny eventually explains he is getting divorced and she insists upon meeting the soon to be ex-wife. Rather than level with her, he asks Jennifer to play the role of his ex-wife which includes make-over and clothes perks.

Barbie Doll, a teacher loves kids and wants to meet Danny's kids. Now Danny must bribe Anniston's kids to pretend to be his kids. Oh what a tangle web we weave...

The movie contains humor about bad plastic surgery plus some toilet humor. It has some good rock tunes, especially as swagger music. When Anniston starts dating a man in another office, Danny shows some signs of jealousy. One lie leads to another and then to another. Predictable and fun, A feel good film of the chick flick variety. If ""Proposal"" was 5 stars, this one would be 4 1/2.

4451836,4,B004QO9H28,"Hmm, Adam Sandler. You either love him or you hate him. And I am always leery of watching films with him in it with my teenagers because you never know how inappropriate it will be. There is inappropriate funny and then there is inappropriate awkward. But I didn't watch this film with my teens so I wasn't really paying attention to that.

Sandler has been in a lot of duds, as has Jennifer Aniston, but I must say that I enjoyed them in this. Though I didn't have high expectations. Actually, I had no expectations at all.

The movie is about a womanizing plastic surgeon, Danny (Adam Sandler), who falls for someone much younger than him (Palmer boringly and annoyingly played by Brooklyn Decker) but ends up getting trapped by his fibs. So, somewhat unbelievably, he, Palmer, his supposed ex-wife Katherine, well-played by Jennifer Aniston, her two kids and his friend, zanily and irritatingly played by Nick Swardson (to the point where I was cringing), all end up going to Hawaii together. Nicole Kidman plays Katherine's university rival Devlin, but I don't really care for her in this. I didn't realize until the end that Devlin's husband was played by singer/musician Dave Matthews; not really much to say about his character.

The start of the film is ok but it gets funnier. Even though it ends up being cliched, I must say that I did enjoy it. It was funny in parts and touching in parts. But my husband would have hated it.

To me, the star of this movie was Bailee Madison who plays Maggie, Katherine's daughter. She is a precocious wanna be actress; with her fake accents, her sensitivity and humor, I thought she was phenomenal. Watch out for this one!",1303344000,20,1668,4.6825938566552905

I won't go over the plot as it's already been done by others, but here's what I liked about this movie:

1. It was funny. Okay we didn't laugh non-stop, but that's because there was a real plot, with real character development. Still there were many very fun surprises and big laughs. I smiled through much of the movie.

2. Sandler was great, Jennifer Aniston was great. Not only are they funny, but they can really act. The entire cast was really good. Sandler's goofy friend sidekick was hilarious, the children were dynamic and funny. Kevin Nealon had an absolutely hilariuos bit. Nicole Kidman was perfect as Jennifer's competitive and not so nice friend.

3. The plot was very different and interesting. Although there's a kind of predictable ending, it's still a fun ride to get there.

The only thing I would have liked to see just a bit different was more heat between Sandler and Aniston. While their relationship was really developed and believable, they didn't seem to have that strong chemistry.

Believe it or not, Aniston is playing the Bergman role of Katherine, a single mom working as an assistant to Danny, a successful LA plastic surgeon played by Adam Sandler. The fact that Sandler is playing the Matthau role appears to be the primary joke here since he turns the excessively inventive single doctor into one of his standard wiseacre man-boy characters.

Directed by Sandler's regular handler Dennis Dugan, the movie opens with a flashback scene in which a pre-nose-job Danny discovers he is about to marry a shrew but soon realizes his gold band is a magnet for hot chicks. He then decides to avoid what he thinks is the inevitable disappointment of commitment by telling every girl he hooks up with that he's married. That ploy changes when he meets a blonde stunner named Palmer. He falls for her, but things start to fall apart when she discovers Danny's gold band in his pocket and assumes he's married. Convinced that Palmer is the one, Danny persuades Katherine to pretend to be his soon-to-be-ex-wife and uses her two manipulative kids as part of the charade. Things go according to formula, including a contrived trip to Hawaii where Katherine runs into a college sorority rival named Devlin, who has been the subject of Katherine's passive-aggressive hostilities all these years. In a bit of stunt casting, Nicole Kidman plays the ultra-competitive Devlin in a comically imperious fashion, while singer/musician Dave Matthews is arbitrarily thrown in the mix as her equally shallow, butt-clenching husband.

Even though this comedy is neither as consistently funny nor tightly structured as ""Cactus Flower"", I have to admit there is a bit of a Cary Grant/Irene Dunne-type of banter between Aniston and Sandler, at least during the first half when Katherine is introduced to Palmer as Danny's confident, materialistic wife (she names herself ""Devlin""). These are the scenes that hew closest to the original movie and consequently work the best. Where it flounders is when the two actors need to show they are falling in love. Sandler is a relative blank slate during these more serious moments, and the lack of credibility in their characters' romantic relationship undermines the film. In the Goldie Hawn role, Brooklyn Decker fulfills the physical requirements as Palmer but is unlikely to be up for any Oscars this time next year. Nick Swardson wins my award for the year's most irritating best buddy in a Sandler comedy, especially when he pretends to be Katherine's lover, an Austrian sheep buyer. Sandler's former SNL colleagues Rachel Dratch and an almost unrecognizable Kevin Nealon show up in cameos as two comically unfortunate victims of plastic surgery.",1299283200,5,3775,6.027932960893855

But, surprisingly enough, I ended up finding almost nothing to like.  The film was bathroom-humor nasty throughout, and it took almost insane delight in mocking the appearance of anyone who fell short of Hollywood gorgeous. Plus, it's been generations since I've seen a film comfortable enough in its own dumb-ass skin to subject persons of so many different creeds, colors, and sexual orientations to so much stereotyping and ridicule.  But the worst part?  The movie came THIS close to making me fall out of love with Nicole Kidman.  And, believe me, that took some doing...

All that well-deserved trashing aside, I did like the few scenes that showed the Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston characters discovering that they've loved each other all along.  Especially the one where - on a dare -- they gaze happily into each other eyes and enumerate the things that each loves most about the other.  Like:  ""I love your sense of humor.""  ""I love coming in to work every day knowing I'll see your smile.""  Though why they wouldn't have realized these things back in the office, I dunno.

4451865,3,B004QO9H28,"...I found it surprisingly funny. It's also a typical Sandler/Dugan collaboration.  Not for one minute do you buy the premise or the lengths the characters go to to keep up the subterfuge, but the audience I saw this movie with laughed.  And in a comedy, that's always a great thing.  So, if you're willing to suspend disbelief and put aside that you've figured out the movie's ending at minute 5, then settle in for some laughs. There's also a pair of surprises in the casting at the half way mark.

I should add that a friend did not like this movie and found Aniston's character's two kids to be annoying (and everything is cartoonishly big)and did NOT recommend the movie.

I did not see Catus Flower so I can't make a comparison, so those that have may have differing opinions.",1297987200,,782,4.557142857142857

4451867,5,B004QO9H28,"""Just Go With It"" is great! This is how the story goes: Danny must engage Katherine, his faithful assistant to pretend to be his soon-to-be ex-wife. Danny must pretend that he is married, because he lied to his dream girl, Palmer, the most gorgeous woman in the world. To keep the woman he loves, covering up one lie soon turns into many lies as Katherine's kids become involved, and then everyone heads off for a weekend in Hawaii that will change all their lives.
