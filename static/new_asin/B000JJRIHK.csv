2672746,5,B000JJRIHK,"Anita does it once again!  This is a great one.  However, her best is MOMSENSE.  It is unbeatable.",1198713600,,98,4.333333333333333
2672747,5,B000JJRIHK,"I used this DVD for my Sunday School class's Ladies' Night Out, and they loved it.  It hit so many ages -- they all enjoyed it.  Great humor, clean, delightful!",1196208000,5,160,4.3
2672748,5,B000JJRIHK,"This woman is absolutely wacky and WONDERFUL!  Our whole family loved this DVD!  She is refreshing, extremely funny, and absolutely clean!",1195171200,9,138,5.523809523809524
2672749,4,B000JJRIHK,"Of all the segments, these are the best: Cruisin' with a Tan (Anita has a strange reaction to the spray-on tan before going on a cruise), Venti Mocha, and Salute to Underwire.  I'm a Christian and love this comedy, but Anita breaks up the act with sentimental songs that are hard to catch on to.

Other than the sentimental songs, the message is good (God wants people that are messed up and broken) and the sketches are hilarious.",1192320000,8,431,4.512820512820513
2672750,5,B000JJRIHK,We got a group of women together and spent the night laughing. This is such a fun show. I would watch it again and again.,1187740800,10,121,3.88
2672751,5,B000JJRIHK,I watched this video at a friend's house and turned around and bought one to give as a gift and one for myself.  We can all use a little lighthearted laughter these days and Anita Renfroe provides a wonderful break in the everyday stress of life.,1185494400,3,246,4.3478260869565215
2672752,5,B000JJRIHK,"I went through a purse phase this past year. I didn't actually collect purses, just the purse-themed stationery products found in all the card stores.

I took purse-themed personality tests, and even hosted a tea using the theme PURSE-ONALI-tea. I guess I had purse on the brain!

But I'm not the only guilty party. Women of all ages are gaga for handbags.

Anita Renfroe wrote a book called ""The Purse Driven Life"" and has followed it up with a DVD called ""Purseonality."" Designed to crack up women of all ages, this DVD covers all the current crazes. Anita takes on topics like: fake tans, designer coffee, America's addiction with eBay, botox, mammograms and the title cut--Purseonality.

Invite your girlfriends over for a Girl's Night Out and pop in ""Purseonality"" to ensure a good time (unless you're a guy-then that might not be acceptable!).

Anita is just one of the girls as she tackles those questions that bug us all. If she can't joke about it, she sings about it, and if she can't sing about it, she makes us think.

Never have I laughed so hard, yet seemed like I had been in church. I felt uplifted and encouraged--filled with hope to face whatever the day holds.

2672763,5,B000JJRIHK,"I would and have recommended this and all of Ms. Renfroe's DVDs to all of my lady friends.  Ms. Renfroe hits every subject ""dead on"" with accuracy and her clean sense of humor and has me laughing so hard my sides hurt.  The first time I saw her, I was hooked.

2672766,5,B000JJRIHK,"I bought this for my daughters in their 40's and for them to share with their friends. It speaks to them where they are at this moment in time. Anita touches the heart as well as the funny bone and reminds us all of how much more we have in common as women than in our differences. Gosh, I wish she was my personal friend!",1355356800,,322,3.9692307692307693
2672767,5,B000JJRIHK,"This is the DVD that first introduced me to Anita Renfroe.  This is Anita Renfroe at her best--laugh out loud, hysterically funny, and rooted in faith.  I bought this one for my mom and my sister, and it's an instant mood boost.  It'll have you in stitches!",1331596800,,257,4.425531914893617
2672768,5,B000JJRIHK,"If ""Purse-onality"" doesn't make you laugh you need a humor tune-up. We had a Purse-onality event at our church. Had a speaker talk about decluttering (with humor), guests brought next-to-new purses to exchange (extras were given to a women's shelter), played what's in your purse game, and, of course, Chapter 10 of this DVD (you can tell a women's personality by the purse she carries). I give ""Purse-onality"" 5 stars.",1320710400,,419,5.0
2672769,5,B000JJRIHK,"We ordered this Dvd for a retreat that we had.  We had our ladies form 80 to 20 years old laughing.  Our theme was on inner and outer beauty.  The dvd was perfect.  Hightly reommend it, also the shipping was great got it when we needed it, and the dvd works great.  thank you.",1287446400,,276,4.037037037037037
2672770,1,B000JJRIHK,We were disappointed in the quality of the video.  It seemed to have been put together by an amateur or the clips used were of lesser quality.  All in all the DVD wasn't funny except for a few clips.  Could have saved my money by just watching the clips on youtube.,1283644800,2,265,4.1568627450980395
2672771,5,B000JJRIHK,"I am the leader of our women's group at church.
I watched many christian comedy dvd's before deciding upon this one
to use for a fun evening for our women.  It was by far the BEST.
The women roared with laughter.
Anita Renfroe is easy to relate to as she shares her comedy
in a down-to-earth manner.  Highly recommend.
This is also a great gift for anyone who
enjoys a good laugh.
Uplifting.
If you're looking for some good, laughs,
save yourself a lot of time and purchase this.",1281052800,,479,4.370786516853933

2672774,4,B000JJRIHK,"This video had some really funny moments. Along with the funny, came some not so funny. I am a Christian lady who enjoys good, Christian entertainment. This video was, for the most part, clean entertainment. I did find it a little weird when the comedian tried to interject serious, spiritual moments throughout her routine. I'm all for spiritual moments, but she didn't execute this well. I enjoyed watching this with a few of my girlfriends; however, some of the content is just for ladies. Overall, it was a good choice in comedy.",1242432000,,533,4.804347826086956

2672778,5,B000JJRIHK,"I absolutely love Anita Renfroe's work!  She is so hilarious with out using crude language and such.  Obviously I don't know her personally but she seems like a moral person and this is the type of comedy I would want my children to watch and find funny (I don't have kids but if I did this is what I would want them to watch).  I would recommend any of her work to anyone, although her work is geared more towards women.",1222300800,,421,4.172839506172839

2672780,5,B000JJRIHK,"This DVD was hilarious. You'll find many topics to laugh about. I particularly loved the bit about mammograms and the title segment on women's ""purse-onalities."" So refreshing to find comedy without swearing thrown in for shock value. This DVD is family-friendly. Buy it, gather a bunch of girlfriends and laugh your fool heads off!",1209686400,,332,5.166666666666667

2672782,5,B000JJRIHK,"Anita Renfroe is wonderful in Purse-onality.  It's filled with lots of good, clean humor for women, especially those of us who are ""at that age"".  I've seen it twice with various girlfriends and my mom and everyone has laughed until they cried! I like it so much I gave several copies as gifts this Christmas.  I'm looking forward to inviting more of my friends over to share it with them.",1198886400,4,389,4.5285714285714285
