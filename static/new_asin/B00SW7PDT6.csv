Regardless if you like or agree with it, John Cena is today's face of WWE & with that came many perks with his various cross over appearances in media in regards to television & film amongst other things while main eventing PPV's such as WrestleMania & being a multi-time champion. As Cena was walking into WWE & being elevated into that spotlight, another superstar who had already achieved all that success was headed on his way out to begin the new chapter in Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. However one small comment after another & a return to the company by it's past superstar opened the door for this match to happen that was a year in the making that WWE chronicles in ""Rock vs. Cena: Once In A Lifetime."" Now a couple of notes here in that this isn't the same documentary that WWE aired on the two NBC television specials throughout the year (although some footage is repeated) and the various names we hear throughout the presentation include Jerry Lawler, Chris Jericho, Rock's family of Rocky & Ata Johnson, Sheamus, David Otunga, The Miz, Triple H, C.M. Punk, Cena's parents & brothers & friends, and of course Rock & Cena themselves.

The documentary beings with Rock talking about walking away from WWE & why he came back after all these years & his ability to entertain before they talk about how John Cena stepped into the spotlight after Rock left & all the criticisms Cena had towards Rock over the past few years. The trash talking between both men was heavily discussed next from impact social media keeping this feud alive during the time Rock wasn't on television to the comments both men made towards each other including the impact of the ""Fruity Pebbles"" line. One of the more interesting parts of the presentation comes up next as different superstars offer their opinions on Rock leaving & coming back right into a main event WrestleMania spot followed by talking about the respect for Cena & the different reactions the fans have for him including the one night he was booed in his own hometown. Thoughts on this being the ""biggest match of all time"" is discussed before closing the documentary on the importance of this match to both men & reflects on it afterwords.

DVD extras featuring The Rock include Big Show's story of sitting with him on a flight, returning to his high school, Triple H talking about his ability to talk, his memories of New York City, his comedy, why failure is so critical to him, the importance of singing to his grandparents, and his relationship with The Tonight Show With Jay Leno. Other extras featuring John Cena include Big Show telling a story about a Christmas gift from Cena, his relationship with his dad, giving back to the business, his opinion on the dueling audience, his brother telling a story of how Rock helped him see Cena's first dark match for WWE, and answering questions from Make-A-Wish kids.

This was a completely different presentation than we get from WWE which is why I enjoyed it very much as it came off as one of those specials that you get from other competitive sports like boxing or MMA where it hypes up an important fight while also lets you get to know the characters involve more personally but the main issue with this release (once you get past the ""Once In A Lifetime"" tagline since they rematched the next year) is that because this is strictly the one disc set is that you don't get the promos & interactions with each other throughout the year along with the actual match itself.  In the end, this is one of those cases where I have to suggest the entire 3 disc set oppossed to just this singular disc because it feels incomplete without showing the actual match & various interactions between each other throughout the year.",1428710400,2,3853,4.651982378854625
