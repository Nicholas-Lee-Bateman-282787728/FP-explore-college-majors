Worth getting if your an Aviation buff or if you just like to see vintage films!!!(Personally, I love to look at what is going on in the background...old cars going by, old scenery and fashions that people are wearing etc.)
Seller is honest and helpful!
Will buy from them again!",1204588800,,502,4.781609195402299
