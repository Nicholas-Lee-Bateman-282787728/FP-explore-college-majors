8699897,2,B00SZ0ANW2,"Dave ( Frederick Schmidt) is a delivery man for his Uncle Jimmy's (Martin Askew) drug business. He likes the product (cocaine aka snow), skims, and goes on binges. His best friend is into Islam (the Paradise aspect of the title), and Dave finds peace in their temple as his life spirals out of control.

The film didn't have much plot. I grew weary watching Dave try to stay awake for a week. The Islam aspect was introduced late and didn't integrate well into the film. Also the director liked to skip scenes, like Dave was sitting at a table nice and neat, then he is in the street all messed up.

For me the film was a waste of time.
