8411870,2,B000E6G8HY,"Although I found the DVD a worthwhile instructional aid on finishing the KTO Sales AR-style modular receiver, the title is misleading:  It stops with a completed, stripped, ""in the white"" lower - NOT A COMPLETE RIFLE.

You will need at least one other video to learn how the lower's internals go together, and if it doesn't show about coatings - like a Brownell's or Duracoat - then you'll need another video for that too.

I don't mind buying another DVD or three about the AR family (AGI!), and I'd have given ""Four Stars"" for the video's clear explanations and unintimidating style, BUT THEY REFUSED TO ANSWER TWO EMAILS ABOUT THE ISSUE (I gave them a month before posting this review) ON THE MISLEADING TITLE, so the DIYguns video gets two stars.

The KTO modular lower is WELL WORTH IT! And the included DIYguns video does help, I just want them to change the dang title to ""Completing the Receiver"" - or something!",1162512000,2,920,4.660493827160494
