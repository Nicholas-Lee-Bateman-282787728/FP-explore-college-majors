8486090,5,B005TCL7CO,Seen this movie on television and enjoyed  it very much. Tried to purchase the English DVD but could not find it. When I saw the Blu--ray available I purchased it but did not realize it was the German version. I later found that it had the English version on the same Blu-ray and so I kept it and was happy I did because I really like the show. I only purchase the ones that I know I will watch again and again. If you like the Asian dragon shows you will like this one for the evil and magic is overcome with goodness and magic,1395014400,4,528,4.0285714285714285
