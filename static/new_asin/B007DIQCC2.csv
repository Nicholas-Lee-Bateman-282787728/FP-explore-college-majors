8524983,3,B007DIQCC2,"Sydney Chaplin's version of Charley's Aunt varies considerably in plot from the stage play.  However, it is still great fun to watch.  The only reason for the downgrade in ratings is the rather poor copy of the picture which has been presented.  I have watched numerous silent pictures over the years, and this is an inferior print for its age.  Nevertheless, it is watchable and remains an amusing piece from Sydney Chaplin's output.",1496880000,,434,4.904109589041096
