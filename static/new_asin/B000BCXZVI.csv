2414048,3,B000BCXZVI,"When a workout begins with marching, I start to worry that the exercises are going to be very bouncy and high impact, but the instructors kept the pace up without creating to much bounce. I would not recommend this to anyone with knee or back problems because frankly there are a lot of lunges within the segments that could be of concern. There are also places where you hold weights and bend over at the waist. This definitely requires a strong stomach and back before you begin these exercises.

So, with cautions in place, I can say the exercises on this DVD are especially effective for intermediate students who have learned the basic moves from a variety of workouts. You are required to keep up at quite a rapid pace at times with little time to reposition yourself on the floor or you have to be back up standing and ready to go with a new set of exercises. For the beginner, this could become a frustration and no real details are given for specific exercises.

The bonuses of this workout are unique moves like the Mountain Climber, which is the Yoga plank pose with leg motion, imagine climbing while facing the floor. Great for balance and upper body strength. The leg swings required a lot of balance and many of the exercises seemed to be super effective. You could feel them working from the first move. The only thing you need is a set of 3-5lb weights. Most of the exercises just use your own body weight.

The sections are all interrupted with a Shape ""screen"" which I tried to ignore. It broke up the music, although it gives you a little break between sections. The format while somewhat frustrating, can be endured for the benefit of the toning, firming and strengthening exercises. I went and put on my swimsuit right after I did this workout just to make sure it works. I still fit into last year's swimsuit, but with this new workout I'm thinking new swimsuits. If you have been working out on a consistent basis and then you try a new workout, sometimes you can even see results the first time you try a workout. This one definitely produces added toning and along with dance exercises, Pilates and Yoga, you should see good results.

2414049,4,B000BCXZVI,"As a veteran and avid fitness enthusiast, I bought this workout a few months ago as a compliment to my extensive cardio workouts and it fits as a perfect balance to my routine. I love the breakdown and the fact that you can shuffle workouts and individual exercises per segment. I have already recommended it to many others who are looking for a good toning workout. The 15 minute segments really feel like just over 5 and if you follow the instructors' advice and use heavy enough weights (finding the correct weight that will fatigue the muscles but not overwork them) you will get a really good sculpting upper body workout.

The only qualm I have with the dvd is the skip between exercises but I also understand that it only does that because of the feature that allows you to put each exercise in the order you prefer. Therefore, having that flexibility within your workout far outweighs that minor issue.

It is especially good for anyone wanting something easy to follow, with clear explanations and all around complete body toning. I use it 3 times a week and will continue on as I've seen results since beginning.",1145232000,4,1122,4.661616161616162
2414050,1,B000BCXZVI,I was very excited to give this DVD a try after reading such good reviews.  I thought it would be similar to the weight training class I take at my local gym.  Unfortunately it did not live up to the reviews or my expectations.  This is a great workout for beginners but not for people who have been at this for a while.  It seemed like I was resting for at least 5 of the 15 minutes for each segment.  I never once felt my muscles getting fatigued from the workout.  After only trying it once I will be putting it up for sale and continue on with my pursuit of finding a challenging workout DVD focusing on weight training.,1142985600,7,624,4.158333333333333
2414051,1,B000BCXZVI,THis dvd was terrible...I am an on the intermediate level..and basically this tape is marketed to advertise Shape magazine not to workout.,1142899200,5,138,5.318181818181818
2414052,3,B000BCXZVI,"While this was much better than the Shape Cardio workout, I thought it was just an okay toning workout overall. It was very choppy as other reviewers have mentioned, and just didn't flow well for me. Both instructors are great, the set was bright and cheerful, music was good. There was a great deal of variety in the exercises, but I honestly didn't like some of them, they just felt strange. Will be returning this one unfortunately.",1139788800,2,435,4.662337662337662
2414053,4,B000BCXZVI,This toning workout is great.  It is fast pace but also gives you time to learn the moves.  I like how there are sections for each part of the body and in each segment you can pick what order you want to do the exercises.,1139184000,2,221,3.888888888888889
2414054,4,B000BCXZVI,"This DVD consists of four 15 minute sections:

1)BUTT & HIPS: effective standing lunge and squat variations with weights and floorwork.

2)ABS: innovative crunch variations and reverse curls that work upper and lower abs and obliques

3)THIGHS: all standing exercises (no weights). Not your average squats and lunges - interesting combos and balance moves

4)UPPER BODY: you'll need a chair and 2 sets of weights.  You'll work biceps, chest, triceps, shoulders and back.

You can choose each segment individually, pick a few or just let the DVD play all the segments and if you do that the order is how I listed it above.  you can also select the order of exercises within each section or let the DVD shuffle the order.

Each toning section has 8-10 exercises and they are very effective BUT there is a pause between each set.  The workout stops and you see a Shape screen with a beach.  Then it goes back to the workout and the next exercise.  The pause is only a few seconds but it's annoying and makes the workout choppy.  I guess it has to be that way so you can select the order of exercises.  One exerciser shows modifications and there are tips that pop up onscreen.

There is also a 20 minute aerobics section.  I didn't do that, so I can't comment.  I wish there was a stretch section instead of the aerobics.  There is a warm-up and cool down before each segment, but it's less than a minute.  I felt I needed a good stretch, especially after the legwork.",1138579200,39,1465,4.547892720306513
2414055,4,B000BCXZVI,"This dvd is created by the same people as the magazine Shape.  That's been around so long because they know what they are talking about and are popular as a result.  This dvd is in two parts.  A short cardio workout, and then mainly a long routine of toning exercises.  This section works abs, legs, arms and hips/buns.  In each of those segments there is 10-12 exercises for each, and you can do them in any order (you can choose to shuffle or play them as they are - this keeps it interesting).  Both of the instructors cue very well and are not annoying like some.  The set is good and light and fun and the only equipment you will need are two sets of weights.  You can choose your level of weights.  This is a good workout that is fun to do.  You'll feel it for a day or two after.",1135468800,18,786,4.1118421052631575
2414056,4,B000BCXZVI,"This video is awesome for toning your muscles. It really gave me a workout. I would not use it if your goal is to lose weight. But, for toning muscle, which is my goal,it is great.",1207785600,3,180,4.027777777777778
2414057,5,B000BCXZVI,This is a great toning workout! I'm very pleased with the results i've gotten so far. The exercises are easy to learn and easy enough to do with practice and they really help to shape the body. I recommend it!,1206316800,2,209,4.25
2414058,3,B000BCXZVI,"I love the Shape bikini boot camp serious so I wanted to pick up some others that they have created. This morning, I tried to do the cardio segment and it just wasn't happening for me. There are too many dance inspired moves with their cardio high/low impact segments. They switch up too fast so if you aren't good at them, you don't work up a good sweat. I haven't done the toning yet which I am sure is good - their toning segments tend to be. Just beware if you aren't great with the dance moves. Find something else to do for cardio.",1205366400,2,537,4.173076923076923
2414059,5,B000BCXZVI,"A friend at work recommended this DVD to me.  I have been working out over my lunch hour and getting my cardio in for the day.  However, I didn't have any time left for some strength training.  I love that this DVD offers the different zone workouts so that you can work on many areas of your body instead of one specified zone.
I look forward to this DVD because it is easy to catch on to; yet at the same time, you are bound to work up a sweat after completing a zone.",1193270400,,470,3.978723404255319
2414060,4,B000BCXZVI,Easy to follow with a moderate workout.  Can be done in a short timeframe.,1188172800,,74,4.285714285714286
2414061,5,B000BCXZVI,"I was looking for a toning workout to use along with my regular cardio routine.  I really like this workout because it is broken up into 4 targeted sections, abs, arms, legs, and buns.  I can work all of the areas or pick just one depending on my area of focus and time available. I also like that I can change up the order of the workout so I don't get bored by doing the same workout every time.  This DVD was a great find.  It was just what I was looking for in a toning workout.",1180396800,,482,3.9381443298969074
2414062,4,B000BCXZVI,"I like the workouts in each ""zone"".  This DVD allows you to choose your workout and the order you do it in.  However, there is no music so you have to provide your own or workout in silence.  Also, it is a little boring.  I work out 3-5 times a week and this really worked different parts of my body, a with little more ""pep and excitement"" I would have given this DVD 5 Stars>",1178928000,,377,3.986666666666667
2414063,5,B000BCXZVI,I enjoy this workout DVD. I have another Shape DVD (Ellen Barrett) and always feel challenged. What I like is you can choose how much time you want to spend in each workout as well as the order. Keeps variety fresh.,1173484800,,215,4.2682926829268295
2414064,4,B000BCXZVI,"I didn't read any reviews before I bought this one on yesterday.  I don't consider myself a beginner to working out, I frequently go the gym for strength training and in the Spring, circuit training.  I have not done any at home videos for a while, but decided to invest in a few in the event that I miss my 5 am gym run.

While waiting for the delivery of Tamilee Webb, ""I want that body"" and Denise Austin's ""Hit the Spot Pilates"", I decided to buy this one at Target b/c I wanted to work out last night. I found it to be very effective and didn't think it would be in the beginning.  I started with buns first and after the lunges, noticed that I might be in for a good workout.  I was right, by the time I got to arms, the last segment, the stops in between the workouts didn't bother me, b/c I was using them to drink water.  I loved the variety of the exercises, I hadn't seen many of them and felt that they were very effective.  I felt the burn this morning, confirming my good workout, and think I will keep this one in my workout rotation for a while.

Not too bad at all for $19.99.",1166486400,,1093,4.051162790697674
2414065,4,B000BCXZVI,"My only problem with this DVD is that it's a little slow-moving and there are long pauses between the 5-minute (or so) sections. Otherwise, it's a great workout and certainly works all the major parts of the body. I really enjoy the ab section - the moves are ones that I haven't really seen before.",1157673600,,299,4.454545454545454
8085310,5,B000BCXZVI,"I rented this dvd a few times and loved it, so I bought it. Nothing fancy needed. Easy to follow. I wanted something that incorporates upper body. This is great for that. You can start with low weights and increase them as you get stronger. Also, you can mix up the order or just work 1 or 2 sections. The only part I am not crazy about is the cardiovascular portion.",1491523200,,367,4.183098591549296
8085311,5,B000BCXZVI,"As I am always looking to stay in shape this video is just that. It is fun and has 4 sections that you can choose from. It doesn't seem difficult while you are doing the activity but the next morning, you sure feel it! A great way to get ready for summer or a trip on the beach. I like to focus on a few sections at a time- such as legs and arms. The results are great as well, you see the definition quickly by staying focused with this.",1471996800,,438,3.8777777777777778
8085312,5,B000BCXZVI,Thanks!,1412726400,,7,7.0
8085313,3,B000BCXZVI,"It was nice at first as I kept popping in the dvd but it seriously gets boring and then the SHAPE Interlock titles between segments...ugh annoyance. No heavy flow to it.

Though I say it was good at first. Beginners will love it! :)

I still love the Cardio section though :)",1278201600,,275,4.269230769230769
8085314,3,B000BCXZVI,"I'm an intermediate-advanced, regular exerciser.  I've done the abs and arms segments of this DVD. I haven't done the lower body segment.  Based on that, I think this DVD has good, all around, overall toning.  But I didn't find it to be as challenging as I expected.  I also don't think it's worth it for the time.  There are three 15-minute segments, and from the two I did, I think they could have done more multiple muscle movements to give a better workout.  I wouldn't suggest this for the time-pressed.

I liked the 20 minute cardio add-on.  This is not the toughest cardio workout I've done, but it's good for days when you want a quick, light cardio to get the heart moving and work up a little sweat.",1265414400,,709,4.441860465116279
8085315,2,B000BCXZVI,"This probably would be a great workout if I wasn't waiting for each exercise to start after the ""Shape"" logo that pops up after every exercise. I didn't finish the workout because of the lack of flow to it. If you don't mind a set-up period for every exercise than it'd be worth a try.",1255564800,,285,4.2
8085316,2,B000BCXZVI,"First, you're forced to watch a 40sec Shape commercial each time you put in this DVD - you can't forward/go to DVD menu. The time-wasting only continues. Many of these moves could be combined to increase your heart rate and make better use of your time. Some exercises are even done sitting/laying down! My heart rate is barely 50% of maximum and muscles are not challenged at all with the basic lunges, mountain climbers, dead lifts, etc. Includes about 7-10 exercises in each section, each exercise lasts about 1.5 minutes (with 5 seconds of instruction and non-movement at the beginning), and a 5 second delay between each exercise - keep moving if you really want a decent workout.

I like Michelle and have purchased her other videos. Lisa Wheeler's jazzercise style annoys me so much it's hard to concentrate. I expect her to go into jazz hands at any moment. This video is about what I expect from a magazine who thinks celebrities are an example of fitness.",1236729600,3,965,4.744047619047619
8085317,4,B000BCXZVI,"I like that this DVD has a 20 cardio minute warm-up!  It's effective in getting the heart pumping and has high impact modifications for really making the most of your cardio time.  After warm-up cardio, I typically pop in this DVD when I want to work on toning a two specific areas (maybe thighs, arms on Tuesday and buns, abs on Thursday).  The toning isn't especially hard; I'd say it is good for beginners, intermediate, and the uncoordinated.  I like this DVD and use it regularly.  It's very easy to follow and incorporate into your fitness routine.",1222560000,2,554,4.670103092783505
8085318,5,B000BCXZVI,"I don't have much time to work out (mother of 3 under 3) so when I do, I have to make it count. Whever I do toning, I feel like I need to rev it up a little and get some cardio in. Whenever I'm doing cardio I think, ""Gee, I hope this can stick with me the way that toning does...""
The thing that struck me right away with this program is that as I was doing the toning moves, I began to feel my heart pumping hard and my breathing was much heavier, as if I was doing cardio, too. That's a great sign to me, because then I can complete my workout in half the time.
I also appreciated that I could do a different body ""segment"" on different days, so I didn't overwork a specific area.
The bonus ""cardio"" segments are NOTHING SPECIAL, just your typical box steps and grapevines, etc. It's the toning segments that stood out.
I rented this through Netflix, now I'm planning to purchase it.",1217203200,,885,4.121387283236994
8085319,1,B000BCXZVI,"I was really excited about this DVD after reading the great reviews, but found it very disappointing. Although there are some good exercises in each section there are NOT enough repetitions of each exercise, and I did the entire workout without breaking a sweat. As a very busy working mom, I feel like this hour long workout (plus the 20 minute bonus) is a waste of time, as there are many more challenging and effective toning workouts out there (try Tamilee Webb or Kathy Smith). I guess this workout is probably targeted to an older, less fit audience (which I consider myself a part of), but I have serious doubts that it could get anyone's body into bikini shape. I didn't even feel sore afterward, and wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone who's serious about getting in shape for summer!!",1210896000,5,796,4.692857142857143
