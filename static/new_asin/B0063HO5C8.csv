4939924,5,B0063HO5C8,"This is quite the inspiring documentary. Very well done. It gives humanity to men considered like mistakes in our society.
You will end up wondering if we had programs available for our young people (the one susceptible to take a wrong turn) to have a similar experience, would we have so much crime in our country....",1350604800,6,318,4.696428571428571
4939925,5,B0063HO5C8,"Of all the documentaries I've ever watched this would rate in the top 5!

Allowing prisoners to look after dying inmates is probably the best form of rehabilitation there is.
You get the feeling these prisoners are their for a reason and have the opportunity to work off their karma directly and effectively.

This documentary is well made and covers all areas of this topic very well.
The interviews are candid and extremely honest, you can really see the huge changes taking place in the prisoners as they go through this process.

I'm looking forward to watching it again.

A must see documentary.",1336348800,5,600,4.796116504854369

I feel that IF I wanted to watch a porno I would buy one. Why put a naked woman in a movie that truly had no real reason for being there.  I was so hopful that the OWN station was going to run this again, however since they did not, I'm buying it.

4939994,5,B0063HO5C8,"This documentary follows an important part of prison inmate life that many people probably never think about: how inmates die. Many inmates come to the end of their natural life while still behind bars. ""Serving Life"" approaches this topic by showing how people within the prison serve others through hospice care within their walls.

It's hard to watch, as it shows real inmates on their death beds. Still, it's an important topic, especially for anyone interested in prison reform.",1465171200,,483,5.113924050632911

4940016,5,B0063HO5C8,"Excellent documentary!  The movie tells about a prison in Alabama which houses long-term convicts.  The prison has a program that puts these inmates to good use, and it creates a change in their hearts.  The change comes by way the prison allowing inmates on good behavior to volunteer for Hospice, taking care of elderly and dying inmates in the prison.  It is amazing to see the effect caring for the dying has on hardened criminals.  Some of the guys volunteering to do this were murderers.  While they express deep regrets for their crimes, they also find purpose in serving others.  I was moved to tears at one point in the movie, and I'm a guy!

4940022,5,B0063HO5C8,"An extremely thoughtful and amazing documentary.  I think it sheds light on a lifestyle that many Americans don't see.  These men are not worthless trash that deserve nothing in life.  They did a crime and they are doing the time, but they don't have to sit in a cell and do nothing. I love that are giving back.  I think the Warden has it right, that eventually these men need to become something more, they need to think less of self, and more of others.  These men are deserving of a respect and love for what they are doing in the hospice care program.  A must see for anyone who doesn't just love documentaries but the stories of life, regardless of where they call home.",1452297600,,676,4.368

Most of men in this film did not deserve a life sentence but use their time to care for other dying inmates. It's a serious injustice that prisons give life sentences for profit and free labor. A new kind of slavery, a shame before God to sentence a young men to life for murders the didn't commit or foolish crimes of their youth. People change and this film reflects that even a murderer can change his heart and life around.

Not only do we find an open-minded, heart-directed warden, but we find a path to true healing for the those incarcerated who are willing to learn compassion and empathy. As someone who taught spiritual principles in a Federal Correctional Institution I can assure you that programs which offer inmates a way to change their hearts and minds are quite rare. This model, using hospice to teach individuals to change their criminal thinking and to put other's needs before their own, is a beautiful concept.

4940045,5,B0063HO5C8,"This film is so good because the questions it asks which are behind the story are universal and powerful ones- Is there any hope for those folks who have done scary bad stuff?  How alike or different am I really from someone bad?  Why does our US justice system sentence crimes using formulas (like 3 strikes you're out for drug offenses and mandatory minimums) instead of applying specific justice to each case?

Also I was amazed at the living story director Lisa R. Cohen was able to capture on film.  You literally see life happen and change while watching.  And the bravery and disclosures of the men filmed- to themselves, each other, and to us...  Powerful and generous.  The synergy of these things is what makes this film life impacting and memorable.

But there is a bad part to the DVD packaging.  I am glad Oprah Winfrey is promoting this film.  The distribution this insures is well deserved by this film.  But why did I have to get on Google before I ever found out the name of the director?  Oprah's branding is so complete that her presence seems to have pushed out even a little nod to the person who actually made the film, director Lisa Cohen.  Producer Forest Whitaker gets his name in there; he is the narrator and producer.  But the crafter of this great work goes nameless on the dvd box and is not mentioned anywhere on it except maybe somewhere in that tiny blurry print at the dvd box back bottom, but I would wager not many souls can read that without a magnifying glass.  Even Rosie O'Donnell gets her name on the box because it says she and Oprah provide introductions to the film.  They don't!  Their introductions are about Oprah launching the OWN documentary club.  Since this is the first film presented by the OWN Doc club, which has started with such a good choice, the omission of the actual filmmaker should be addressed for future film presentations as to give the artists credit and recognition for their worthy work.",1397433600,8,1956,4.587896253602305

The language is very raw, but is essential to the film's integrity.  After hearing horror stories about Angola Prison for many years, the story of these men was shocking.  The warden is to be greatly admired for recognizing this need and implementing the means to meet it.  I plan to show it at my church in the near future.",1373328000,8,491,4.729411764705882

This documentary examines the extremes- men who are incarcerated for life for heinous crimes against their fellow man- murder, armed robbery and such are learning to give and find God through service to the dying.  Life imprisonment is an ultimate existential crisis- what is the meaning of my life, why am I here?  It also challenges us ""free persons"" to look at the concepts of jain, incarceration, life imprisonment, the death penalty, redemption, punishment, penal code, protecting society and so on.  The prison Warden says something to this effect in the film-  these are old men, dying men, no longer predators; what are they doing living and dying here?",1363478400,3,772,5.185483870967742
