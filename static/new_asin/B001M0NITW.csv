8320282,4,B001M0NITW,"""Return To Penguin City"" is the only documentary I know of to report exclusively on the Adelie Penguin, so I consider it an essential video to own.  However I have to warn you that it is not anywhere to the level of wildlife documentaries that we have come to expect from BBC Nature and PBS Nature.

""Return To Penguin City"" is about a group of scientists who go to Ross Island in Antarctica to study the Adelies.  The documentary appears to have been filmed on consumer-grade video equipment by amateur photographers rather than professionals.

Despite that, it is an interesting documentary and the Adelies are really engaging to watch.",1410739200,,638,4.825688073394495
