439799,4,6302241189,"Honky Tonk is the story of Candy Johnson (Clark Gable), a swindler with plenty of charm. It is this quality that makes him so much money, but his line of work has him constantly moving from town to town. He vows to stop this by setting up stakes in a new town which he plans to take by storm. His intentions seem good when he starts his own saloon to get away from the corruption of the sherriff. He takes the town drunk, also the judge (Frank Morgan), under his wing and makes eyes at the judge's daughter (Lana Turner). His plot is completely successful, but at the expense of the people around him.

Turner and Gable work well together, but this is Gable's film all the way. He uses his trademark personality masterfully in this role. All of his charm is believable and it is no wonder people do what he wants. His appeal with women is undeniable here, which is the main reason this movie is worth watching. The story is somewhat thin; it is mainly a showcase for its stars.",1215475200,,977,4.33879781420765
439800,4,6302241189,"Honky Tomk is an evasion movie that counts with the first meeting of this well reminded couple: Clark Gable in one of his finest roles as the winning gambler, that knows all the possible tricks and cheats all of those who intend to try to be smarter than him. He will meet to the lovable Lana Turner and as you may guess, they will fall in love, with the used action we expect in this genre of easy romantic comedy.

A film to watch in a rainy Sunday evening.",1174348800,2,459,4.157303370786517
439801,5,6302241189,"Like a previous reviewer, I can safely say that the plot in this 1941 classic really isn't that important. The movie earns a 5-star rating for one thing and one thing alone: the amazing chemistry between Clark Gable and luscious 20-year-old Lana Turner in their first of four movies made together. ""Honky Tonk"" was a huge hit for MGM , thanks in part to their sensational ad/publicity campaign which included the oddly prophetic tag-line ""Clark Gable kisses Lana Turner in Honky Tonk-and it's screen history."" Also, Life's magazine with the Gable/Turner cover was one of it's top-selling issues of 1941.

Here's the plot for those who care: Clark Gable stars as ""Candy"" Johnson, a charming, smooth-talking con-artist who arrives in the gold-mining town of Yellow Creek looking for easy money. He meets Elizabeth Cotton (Lana Turner) and is instantly attracted to her, but she sees through his tricks and is reluctant to trust him. However, Candy discovers that Elizabeth's dad (Frank Morgan) is a corrupt judge and so they join forces. Candy builds a gambling house and a church(!), and becomes a respected leader in the community. He also wins Elizabeth's trust and love, although to avoid his sly tricks to get her into bed she gets him drunk and marries him. His former girlfriend ""Gold Dust"" Nelson (Claire Trevor) had tried to drive Elizabeth away, but in both the beauty and intelligence department she was simply outclassed by Elizabeth!

Elizabeth and Candy are very happy and Candy becomes very wealthy from his illegal schemes, and eventually it becomes too much for Elizabeth's father to take. When he's about to inform the town council about Candy's criminal activities, he's shot and killed by one of Candy's partners (who was acting without orders). Meanwhile, Elizabeth has becomes pregnant but loses her child after falling from her carriage. With his wife in a weak condition and the townspeople ready to lynch him, he finally realizes the error of his ways and decides to leave town. Elizabeth, though, won't let Candy's guilt destoy their once happy marriage, but it may be too late to save their relationship...

""Honky Tonk"" is a very entertaining romance, and the supporting cast (Claire Trevor, Frank Morgan, Marjorie Main, Albert Dekker, and Chill Wills) adds a lot. It's no surprise that Clark Gable's wife, Carole Lombard, was suspicious and jealous during the filming of ""Honky Tonk"". The eleven steamy kisses between Lana Turner and Clark Gable in the movie offered a more than suggestive hint that the two might've been having a romantic relationship off-screen, although in her autobiography Turner denied this rumor. Although the main attraction of the film was of course Lana and Clark, I really enjoyed watching Claire Trevor play another ""discarded girlfriend"" role. I hope that MGM will release this and the other three Gable/Turner movies (""Somewhere I'll Find You"", ""Homecoming"", and ""Betrayed"") on dvd. They just don't make 'em like this anymore!",1120435200,11,2984,5.098159509202454
439802,4,6302241189,"Never mind the story of HONKY TONK.  It's strictly synthetic. Its gold miners and saloon toughs, its shady ladies and bad men are there only to provide a colourful Wild West background for more fundamental business.  And that business is a series of sizzling bedroom scenes in which, in a variety of dress and undress, Clark Gable and Lana Turner make love.  For Gable, this meant another Rhett Butlerish  role - a sardonic, hell-raising rogue that kept him an irresistable box-office magnet.  As for 20-year-old Lana, she graduated from sweaters to nightgowns; this was her best feature in her meteoric four-year climb to success.  This Pandro S. Berman production from 1941 has Clark in top form as Candy Johnson; his charm in this should still make female hearts flutter; Lana Turner was graced with immense sex-appeal; here she proved she could act as well. Despite a certain lack of speed (it tends to ramble on and go nowhere) its sexy and lusty with good direction by Jack Conway. Gable is a heel and Turner is the beautiful daughter of corrupt judge Morgan in this western soap which is routine and predictable. Turner and Gable make an attractive team (they kiss 11 times in the movie!) Gable did a screen test with Turner when she was an amateur in 1938, he remembered she was awful & spoke her lines with ""no feeling"". By 1941, although still a starlet, she had learned a few lessons in the acting department. (Never a great actress, Turner nevertheless knew the tricks of the trade). Candy Johnson was a good role for Gable, even though the story inconsistencies at times make him look a greater sucker that the mobs he trims. Tough Claire Trevor does well in her difficult role as the dancehall girl and Marjorie Main is nigh hilarious as the lusty old widow; Turner never falters in her presentation of Lucy Cotton. Carole Lombard Gable was intensely jealous of Turner and made frequent visits on the set; tragically, she died the following year.",948153600,16,1960,4.766961651917404

439873,4,6302241189,"Great movie. This film is one of my Gable favorites. Lana Turner did a pretty fair job too. I understand that she tried out for the role of Scarlett, but David Selznick felt that she was too young to have a grasp of the part. So- by the time she did Honky Tonk, she'd come a long way as an actress.

This film has a lot of action, romance and adventure. No viewer will be disappointed.",1432684800,,385,4.065789473684211

was sweet to watch the process.  I like the change of hearts that took place with various characters and the faith and the unwavering belief of others in seeing the good in people where others may not. That's a good approach that CAN pay off sometimes and the movie was a good reminder of that, because its so easy not to remember that aspect of life today.",1355270400,,481,4.344444444444444

7822714,5,6302241189,"Jack Conway was an actor in D.W. Griffith's stock company. He began directing in 1912, making over 100 films in 35 years, and ended his career as one of MGM's great contract directors. If you haven't seen SARATOGA, LIBELED LADY, BOOM TOWN, LOVE CRAZY, or THE HUCKSTERS, to name only a few, you must get on the case post-haste. HONKY TONK is a Conway classic from his late period, with great photography from Harold Rosson and Bill Daniels, and select MGM contract players in peak form. The opening tar and feathers scene with Clark Gable and Chill Wills is worth the price of admission by itself. Albert Dekker is superbo in another one of his bad guy specialties, and Frank Morgan actually tops himself. Watch this film three times in order to absorb all the careful details, the double entendres, the delicious pace of the editing, Lana Turner's masterful underplaying, a cornucopia of ineluctable Gableisms, and you'll just be warming up to see two dozen more Jack Conway films another dozen times. Think of what fifteen dollars will get you today, buy two copies of this DVD, and give one to an unwitting friend. Cheers.",1463097600,,1124,4.769230769230769
