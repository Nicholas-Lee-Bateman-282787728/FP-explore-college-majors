8507840,2,B0070WQ604,"For me these ""under review"" documentaries are ""under whelming""  I've owned two of them. They don't include much, if any, actual interviews with the artist, or any actual recordings of the music.  Probably due to not wanting to spend money for the rights to use the actual music.  Save your money for their albums or concert videos.",1407801600,,331,4.771929824561403
8507841,5,B0070WQ604,"If you have an interest into the chronology of Van Morrison's work, this will enlighten you.  But don't expect full-length songs, but you will see several clips of performances.  You will see  compilation of various interviews that Van has done through the years.  Also played are several  audio recordings of Van Morrison comments.

Plenty of early photos are shown, including one of his first wife, but the documentary does not get much into his very personal life.  You will also learn about each album through the early career, the success, the failures, the inside info on albums.  The several people commenting are musicians, biographers, journalists, etc.  But, keep in mind that you will not always see the name of the person commenting, which is needed during a lengthy documentary.

The 2-hour  documentary begins in early 70s with the band Them and ends in 1974.  And surprising, you will learn, what is most likely, his most profound, and popular work,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Astral-Weeks/dp/B000002KAT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Astral Weeks</a>came about.

I will never stop listening to Astral Weeks!

One interesting concert footage is on Van,  a man who shakes it up on stage.  Seeing Van enthusiastically move on stage was surprising.

Ok, so pay attention, because at the Bonus Feature section, is probably 20 interactive questions to test your knowledge.  Answers provided also.  This is a great documentary, and the viewer is given a perspective on his personality, his genius, his influences, his spiritual guidance, his musings, his vocal abilities, his talents!......Rizzo",1289088000,,2482,7.765124555160142
8507842,4,B0070WQ604,"I am extremely glad that this DVD is available.  Van Morrison is a remarkable artist.  Not for his musical skills, but because, if you are attuned, his music lifts and transports.  The experience is rare and is a delight.  It comes from his inherent sense of melody and how it is transmitted, it comes from the freedom from conventions and trust in his musical colleagues.  It comes from seeing the music in the word 'ballerina'.  For many, it is helpful to understand where the unique musical character comes from.  The commentators place Van's music in context, they are critical when it is deserving, but they also know what deserves to be glorified.  What is missing from this account is any sense of the more personal challenges that  shaped Van's priorities and choices.  That leaves a gap yet to be filled.  This DVD is not a DVD of music, it is about a musician.  The DVD covers the early days in the Northern Ireland scene, his home in East Belfast, and the initial training ground of the showbands.  Then, Them. Gloria was the harbinger of what was being prepared.  Then through the whole series of albums, good an bad, from Astral Weeks through to Veedon Fleece.  Great years.  If you like Van, and you like to understand the source of what you like, this is good.  It is disappointing not to hear much of the music, but the most aggravating feature is the patchwork character of the compilation.  Aw, if only it had been put together better.",1284076800,,1453,4.609375
8507843,1,B0070WQ604,"This DVD has some great early Van clips and some tapes of interviews with him talking about his music.  The problem is that the bulk of the disk is people talking about Van's work, what these works mean and rating the various albums.  One of them actually played on Veedon Fleece and has some interesting perspective.  The other 3 or 4 guys reviewing seem like idiotic pundits prattling.",1264809600,6,387,4.661764705882353
