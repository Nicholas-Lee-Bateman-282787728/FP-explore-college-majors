7845234,3,6303398170,"Before taking on the role of the wiseguy in the acclaimed CBS series, Ken Wahl was making fluff movies like this 1987 corker.  It is mildly entertaining, as it invokes memories of the cop series of the 70s and 80s.  Wahl plays a journalist whose daughter is kidnapped by a terrorist group.  He is joined by veteran character actor George DiCenzo in trying to get his daughter back.  Doug McClure (Trampas on THE VIRGINIAN) plays a clueless cop on a diet, addicted to licorice sticks and spouting out bad euphemisms.  There's not a lot of action in this movie, and what little there is, seems awkward and uninspired.  The soundtrack itself sounds like a Tommy Mottola 70s record.  Unoffensive if you're into this kind of thing.",1082678400,,726,4.714285714285714
