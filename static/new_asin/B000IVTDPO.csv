8147591,5,B000IVTDPO,"I really like this workout.  The Body Fusion workout is a 50 minute workout that alternates between step and weighted segments.  Some of the step combos take time to figure out, but I think Cathe does a good job of explaining most.  She adds one step of the combo at a time.  I think the step combos are really fun once you get the hang of them.  There are also 3 add ons that if put together can make a 50 minute toning workout.  There is a 20 minute upper body sculpt, a 20 minute lower body sculpt, and a 10 minutes stability ball ab workout.  All of these do a great job of working the areas they are supposed to.  The upper and lower body workouts use hand weights and a resistance band.  However, the exercises using the resistance band could easily be done with hand weights, ankle weights, or no weights at all.  The ab work is done on a stability ball but she does have someone doing them without one on the floor.",1490659200,,923,4.193181818181818
8147592,1,B000IVTDPO,"I am a HUGE Cathe fan, but the aerobics on this DVD were too complicated for me.  I've been trying to incorporate more intensity into my workouts and this is intense, but the steps and turns get me messed up.  I'm 55 years old, so that might have something to do with it :-).  But I have been working out since I was in my late 20's and I have never done too well with dancey or advanced choreography.  I also get dizzy doing too many turns around the step.  There is a short weight workout toward the end though, so I will skip the aerobics and just do that.",1312329600,,559,4.045454545454546
8147593,5,B000IVTDPO,This video is one the best dvd's out there if you are a beginner or fallen off of the horse.  It either gets you into the swing of things or gets you back into the swing of things.  The video is enjoyable and has two workouts that are aimed at the beginner to intermediate.,1230940800,2,273,4.037037037037037
