8409347,4,B003YJ4WXU,"This movie is interesting for its unsympathetic portrayal of the main character, played by William Haines. His behavior would now get him arrested or at least censured for his treatment of any woman in his path. If one knows the actor's real story, one might catch hints of why he abandoned acting for a more profitable career as one of Hollywood's most sought-after decorators.
Marie Dressler is featured prominently in cast lists, along with her frequent comic foil Polly Moran, but their roles are relatively minor although for some the only real reason to watch the movie.",1508976000,,576,4.948453608247423

8409350,3,B003YJ4WXU,"I'm glad to see that other reviewers had much the same reaction to the lead character, Tom Ward (William Haines), as I did. I guess we're supposed to find his high-jinks endearing, but I just wanted to snatch him bald-headed -- at least, in the first half of the movie.

That said, this is a pretty watchable movie. It has good production values -- it's an A picture, not B. And I always enjoy seeing Marie Dressler and Polly Moran. So I would watch it again sometime and I think it was worth the price.",1435536000,3,503,4.294736842105263
8409351,2,B003YJ4WXU,"From the opening scene in which there is a car chase across the railroad tracks with a train coming, I thought this movie might be good for some silly laughs. The smile on my face left rather quickly. With the exception of a few scenes (saved by two worthy mature actresses), this old movie registered between fascinatingly awful to truly revolting. Were we supposed to like this main character? Yuck. It's hard to imagine any woman attracted to some guy jumping around, talking in cartoonish, baby voices, making dumb faces and quite literally forcing his romantic attentions on her--even in a vintage black and white comedy these harassment/stalking scenes were wince-worthy. Because it was in the script, the leading lady falls for the guy. If you like old screw ball comedies, there are funnier ones.",1388620800,,804,4.962962962962963
8409352,4,B003YJ4WXU,"Great to have another movie on DVD with William Haines. I like this actor very much. He's somehow funny, charming... handsome of course.

The movie itself isn't bad. It has any funny moments and I enjoyed it very much. I liked very much the scenes between him and Polly Moran (as housemaid) and Marie Dressler. Both are great comedians.

The DVD

the picture quality isn't perfect of course. But for not restored or remastered still very good and also the sound is acceptable.

the only minus point (star) I have: no english subtitles.",1306195200,2,535,4.720430107526882
8409353,3,B003YJ4WXU,"Tom (William Haines) is a cocky, recent graduate of college who, as the only son of a rich father, expects everything to go his way, both at work and romantically with the girl of his dreams (Leila Hyams). Then his father dies suddenly, plunging Tom's family into poverty and leaving Tom as their sole support.

This early talkie suffers from many technical difficulties in both camera work and sound. In addition, the personality of the lead character, Tom, is extremely unsympathetic because he is so often selfish and mean-spirited. Most of the story's slapstick humor is based on his, frankly, childish attempts to get his way in every situation. In spite of that fact, this film was quite successful in its day because Haines was a popular silent film actor who made a name for himself playing again and again the same type of hero he portrays in this film: A brash young man is initially filled with unwarranted confidence, encounters frequent disaster brought on by his own arrogant mistakes, and emerges at the end of the film as a humbled, and wiser, man.

Those particularly likely to appreciate this movie are fans of William Haines and film-history buffs. What I personally enjoyed the most about The Girl Said No was the stand-out performances of two wonderful character actors: Polly Moran as the loyal family housekeeper, and the great Marie Dressler as a wealthy old lady whom Tom gets drunk in the process of trying to sell her an investment opportunity. That scene midway in the movie was, to me, worth the price of admission. It's laugh-out-loud funny.",1284940800,6,1571,4.858208955223881
