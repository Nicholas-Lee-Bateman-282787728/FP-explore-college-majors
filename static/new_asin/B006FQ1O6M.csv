8497146,3,B006FQ1O6M,"First off, I had some difficulty finding a player that could play the DVD.  Though the box clearly states ""DVD"", the disc is not playable on two machines that I tried: a Blu-Ray player and my MacBook Pro.  I was able to play the disc when I ran my Mac in Parallels mode

The sets are performed in a fair enough speed that you can follow.  It is then seen in slow motion.  I don't recall if the set was broken down into sections or if there was a change in viewing angle so I can't comment on that.  The applications are presented multiple times and I do believe I could either hear the teacher speak English or the subtitles were in a fair translation of the material and not some person who doesn't know the techniques.  The translations that I did read were understandable and not choppy or gibberish

In all, it was a nice viewing the first time around.  The reduction in stars is because the disc is not playable in all formats.  It only seems to be in PC only mode and does not support Apple iDVD",1367712000,,1001,4.221052631578948
8497147,5,B006FQ1O6M,"I took some Wu Tan classes a long time ago, in a land far, far away, so I was delighted to pop this DVD in my player and find that it details one of the forms I'd forgotten all about! (I did not pay much attention to the names of the forms, way back when.)

If I hadn't already taken some mantis classes, I would have a very, very hard time understanding the material this DVD covers. The instructor places a lot of emphasis on correct technique, and references some of the more advanced kung-fuish things that you wouldn't pick up on as a total newbie (like combining the energy of one part of your body with another part of your body in order to increase the force of your attack).

The DVD is in Chinese, designed to be interpreted for an English-speaking audience. So you won't have to go to a menu to access subtitles (they're automatically there for you in English while the instructor is speaking in Chinese). There are some typos and/or words that I didn't understand in the subtitles, but if you've done kung fu before, you should be able to understand all the instructor's points no problem.

So! If you've had some experience before, I think you will really enjoy this! It's structured exactly like a kung fu class. The instructor will show you the form, demonstrate the movements, and expect you to follow along as best as you can. And you need to do it over, and over, and over, and over again to improve. There is so much material to glean from this forty minutes or so of instruction. The instructor has very crisp technique and shows the moves in the form at three different angles.

I plan to nerd out on this video for a few months and then try one of the other ones in the series. It's really cool that this stuff is available to anyone with a DVD player!",1347926400,,1774,4.366666666666666
