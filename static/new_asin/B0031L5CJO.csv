4049268,5,B0031L5CJO,"As I write this, the reviews for Season 1.3 and Season 2 are mixed together. This review is in regard to Season 2.

It begins with the 5-part episode ""Arise, Serpentor, Arise!"" This is where we see the 1st season characters mixed with all the new players, for both G.I. Joe & Cobra. After this it's all single, self-contained episodes for the rest of the entire season.

As a kid in the 80's, I absolutely loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-1/dp/B001U9BS38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 1</a>, yet I lost interest somewhere in the beginning of Season 2. These days I like it all. It seems like a signature of the 80's, years before heightened political correctness, that kids had heroes with names like Sgt. Slaughter! :) Serpentor is basically a 1-dimensional character, constantly yelling at subordinates & slapping them around, not unlike some supervisors I've had in the past(!). :o

I like that the ranking of the main G.I. Joe & Cobra characters gets clarified & explained. The Joes are led, in order, by General Hawk, Duke, Flint, and Beach Head- with Sgt. Slaughter having some kind of special role. Cobra's leadership is remixed & fractured, with Serpentor and Dr. Mindbender taking center stage, and with Cobra Commander, Destro, Baroness, and Zartan still around but not as prevalent. Zaranna gets a surprising amount of screen time. Major Bludd, Storm Shadow, and Firefly are still here, yet barely get involved. Lots of characters from Season 1 either briefly appear or are seen in the backgrounds. Shipwreck, Flint & Lady Jaye are major carry overs into the new season.

I think the writing is especially creative in Season 2, although it's obvious the creators were pushing the new characters into the forefront. Fans of Season 1 may be a little disappointed with how infrequently popular characters like Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow, Spirit, and Quick Kick appear.

Season 2 successfully breathes new life into the concept, with the full-length G.I. Joe film, released in '87 I believe, serving as a potential starting point for a never created Season 3.

- New Joes include: Sgt. Slaughter, General Hawk, Beach Head, Leatherneck, Wet Suit, Mainframe, Lifeline, Dial-Tone, Low Light, Cross Country, Iceberg, Sci-Fi, and Slip-stream, among others.

- New enemies include: Serpentor, Dr. Mindbender, Zandar, Zaranna, Monkey Wrench, Thrasher, the B.A.T.s (Battle Android Troopers), and more.",1354320000,12,2457,5.3662337662337665
4049269,4,B0031L5CJO,Although this series has not aged perfectly it is still important because it's one of the first cartoon series to break free of the network censorship rules in the 1980s. It also helps that G.I. Joe is an ensemble cast rather than it becoming the Snake Eyes show;) The characters are lovable and are brought to life by the voice acting. If you're into old cartoons you should check it out.,1353283200,4,389,4.492957746478873
4049270,3,B0031L5CJO,"I totally understand the glowing nostalgic reviews on here, but I just finished watching the second season, and it's just ok.  It's not bad, but it just isn't as good as the first season.  With the exception of the introduction of Serpentor early on in the classic ""Arise Serpentor, Arise"" multi-episode saga, there isn't that much interesting going on and it seems even more like a toy commercial for series 5 of the toy line.  Cobra Commander is marginalized by Serpentor, and the Cobra ranks are sort of in disorder, which for me kind of diluted their badness rather than adding to it.  There are some pretty 'out there' episodes that are worth watching just for their sheer weirdness though.  This is when a lot of kids started watching other shows back then.  I'm glad I saw it but I wouldn't watch it all again.",1347408000,3,817,4.6
4049271,5,B0031L5CJO,"This show has may seem like a relic to some. To me it was a great show that combined the talents of great Marvel comics writers. Steve (Howard the Duck) Gerber was story editor and writer.  Gerry Conway, Marv Wolfman and Martin Pasko wre the best Marvel Comics writers to write for this series. They elevated the stories into something entertaining that stood the test of time.  The animation was colorful and good for resources that were available.

What I liked about this was the portrayal of good vs. evil. The good guys were good and the bad guys were bad. There was no grey area where you felt sympathy for the villians.  Too many of todays cartoon dramas focus on making the villian a sympathetic character. Cobra, Destro and the rest were focused on one goal. World domination. The Joes had one goal. Taking out the enemy, Cobra. It was a bold and colorful drama, and a formula that shouldn't be tampered with.

Accept no imataitons.  If you want to see the real G.I. Joe, watch the animated show. The live action movie is just an imatation.",1325894400,9,1049,4.553191489361702
4049272,5,B0031L5CJO,Watching these old GI Joe shows really take me back! I know everyone been saying something thing like this but the hummer these show have. Small jokes really catches me now more then it did back them. Love the action but its the little things that make its great! Love the trash talk between Wet Suit and Sarge! I can't wait for some of the other movies that came out. Like GI Joe and Cobra joining up to take out a drug lord! I know there more other seasons and I be waiting for them and ordering them as they come out!!,1279843200,2,521,4.117647058823529

Amazon made it so easy to get.  Love Prime!  If you like G.I. Joe, then you'll love this last volume.",1275955200,6,257,4.142857142857143
4049274,5,B0031L5CJO,"This product from a design standpoint is way way better than the previous version. It's conceptual, organized, and the colors keep its unified and cohesive.

4049275,5,B0031L5CJO,"then you will be happy to know you can FINALLY COMPLETE YOUR GI JOE collection.

Originally, the last half of the second season was NOT available on DVD. That's a long story, but the point is....

WE COULD NOT purchase it and have the whole thing!!

That is why they are releasing Season 2 ALL in one package. THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO NEED JUST THE SECOND HALF. SO THEY ARE MAKING ME PAY
FOR THE ENTIRE SECOND SEASON.

It's a way for them to make more money off of people like me who loyally purchased the originals. Nice huh??? Makes me sick.

But, the actual episodes are great. I don't want to take away from that, thus the 5 stars review.

Dirty trick, but I'll still buy it. No other choice!!!",1269129600,11,717,4.235294117647059

4049288,4,B0031L5CJO,"Classic American cartoon. Needed more Serpentor, and missed some of the characters from season one like Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes. Its clear that season 2 has focus on a select group of new characters (Beach Head, General Hawk, Dialtone, etc.), but pleased with the series as a whole. Anyone who claims that G.I.Joe the animated movie was far removed from the series as far as fantasy needs to actually go back and watch the original series - both seasons - they contain just as much fantasy.

4049291,4,B0031L5CJO,"This was the second (and final) season of the show produced by Sunbow Animation, and it's changed quite a bit from the first season, mostly due to the inclusion of the Serpentor character.  The DVD set is similar to Vol. 1-3 of the first season, with 29 episodes spread across 4 discs and including original commercials, ""Knowing is Half the Battle"" PSAs, and a making-of documentary as extras.  Highlights of the season include:

1.  Arise, Serpentor, Arise: A 5-part miniseries that begins the second season and introduces the new antagonist, Serpentor (whose constant cries of ""This I command!"" might prove pretty grating if you're revisiting this show for the first time since you were 8) and is on par with the earlier miniseries.
2.  Sink the Montana: My personal favorite as a kid, in which a due-to-be-decommissioned battleship is turned into a superweapon by COBRA.  I mostly remember it due to the poignant ending (well, at least it was poignant when I was 8).
3.  The Million Dollar Medic: An episode focusing on the pacifist GI Joe member, Lifeline.  Although this character was probably no one's favorite, it does a good job reconciling how a character who refuses to use violence can successfully function in a military organization.
4.  Cobrathon: COBRA hosts a telethon.  Easily the best of the ""writers are just going to be ridiculous and have fun with it"" episodes.
5.  Nightmare Assault: COBRA attacks the Joe team through their dreams.  The episode helps to deepen underutilized characters such as Lowlight and Iceberg.
6.  In the Presence of Mine Enemies: An episode using the time-honored genre trope of stranding two members of opposing sides, forcing them to cooperate to survive.",1435536000,,1704,5.0

4049293,1,B0031L5CJO,"This review concerns the DVD set, not the series.  I'd give the series itself 5 stars.

I purchased the individual volumes instead of the box set because I read all the reviews on the box set that concerned the glue-like substance on the DVDs.  I had hoped to avoid this problem by purchasing the individual volumes.  However, my efforts were useless.  All the DVDs within this set contained the glue-like substance.  I was able to remove the substance by wiping the DVDs with undiluted rubbing alcohol.  I shouldn't have to clean brand-new DVDs!  On top of that, the box looked like it had been chewed on by a toddler!  Seriously!  The box was wrapped in plastic, but the edges were worn and appeared to have tooth marks in them.  This set was not worth the money.  In fact, I suspect that it was used, returned, and re-wrapped in plastic by Amazon!  Since I had to deal with these problems anyway, I now wish I'd ordered the box set and saved money!  Thank you, Amazon and Shout! Factory, for the fine swindle!

4049299,5,B0031L5CJO,"As you know, G. I. Joe Season 1.1 was a mixed bag for me, though I did love some of it.  It was after watching some of the best ones that I went ahead & got this one for less than 8 dollars.  Surprisingly, I found this to be much better.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

66-70.  Arise, Serpentor, Arise!:  After being inspired by a strange dream, the fiendish Doctor Mindbender plans to obtain the DNA samples of history's greatest conquerors in order to make the ultimate Cobra Emperor.  Next to The Revenge of Cobra, this is the best of the 5 part stories.  It is really good.  A+

71.  Last Hour To Doomsday:  Cobra demands the U.S. to submit or they will use a giant vortex to destroy the East Coast of the United States.  Flint and Lady Jaye decide to take on this mission to stop them in order to prove to Beachhead that the two lovers can work effectively as a team and save the day.  A good episode.  B

72.  Computer Complications:  A space probe containing anti-matter crashes into the ocean and both Joes and Cobra try to retrieve it.  Meanwhile, Mainframe falls in love with a disguised Zaranna.  This was a great spotlight for Mainframe.  A

73.  Sink The Montanna!:  The Joes are at the decommissioning ceremony for a battleship, the U.S.S. Montana.  But Cobra tries to foil their plans.  Admiral Lattimer, former captain of the Montana, betrays the Joes and allies himself with Cobra and the Joes must stop him from harming more innocent people.  One of the best episodes ever.  A+

74.  Let's Play Soldier:  The Joes raid a village in southeast Asia to prevent villagers from collecting tree sap for Cobra. During the mission, Leatherneck has an encounter with four street orphans.  Easily the worst episode of G. I. Joe I have ever seen.  F

75.  Once Upon A Joe:  Cobra Strato-Vipers attempt to steal the MacGuffin Device but are stopped by G.I. Joe. Now, the Joes must prevent this device from falling into Cobra's evil hands.  Now this is more like it.  Shipwreck is one of my favorite characters, his story was hilarious & the plot was surprisingly good for a kid-centric episode.  The only bad thing was the finish felt wrong.  It was too ominous for such a light episode.  But the rest of it was perfect.  A

76.  The Million Dollar Medic:  In the Joe/Cobra battle in the Caribbean, a civilian yacht is sunk. But the Joes save the day.  The heiress Brittany Van Mark falls for Lifeline who helped her recover. Serpentor wants to claim the business of Owen Van Mark and sends Baroness, Tomax, and Xamot to capture Bree in order to make Owen Van Mark sell his company.  A pretty good spotlight for Lifeline.  I especially liked his relationship with Lift Ticket.  A-

77.  Cobrathon:  Cobra pirates airwaves and stages a telethon to raise funds for criminals and terrorists in order to delete all known terrorist activities from every international database in the world.  This episode is as silly as the Baroness' dress is skimpy (Seriously, how did that get past the censors?  That was pretty sexy for a cartoon made to sell toys.)  Still, it's not horrible, just not very good either.  C

78.  The Rotten Egg:  Leatherneck attends graduation ceremonies at a new academy and discovers it run by dishonorably discharged soldier Buck McCann, now leader of Cobra's own Marine Corps.  A fine episode for Leatherneck.  He's probably my least favorite of the new characters, but this episode is still watchable.  B

79.  Glamour Girls:  Madame Vail agrees to sell Doctor Mindbender usage of her facial transference machine in exchange for Cobra kidnapping the world's top models so that she can steal their faces for herself.  Unfortunately for Cobra, one of the kidnapped models is the sister of Lowlight and the Joes spring into action to foil Vail's scheme.  One of the best episodes ever.  Lowlight is my favorite of the new Joes this season, and easily one of my top ten if not 5 characters from this series, so any episode where he plays a significant role gets big bonus points from me.  A+

80.  Iceberg Goes South:  Iceberg and the rest of the Joes are in an Arctic region training and testing new equipment.  Another pretty good spotlight episode.  A-

81.  The Spy Who Rooked Me:  The Joes must work alongside English secret agent Matthew Burke to stop Cobra from obtaining a paralyzing gas.  A good episode.  B

82.  Grey Hairs And Growing Pains:  The Joes set out to find the connection between Cobra and a special youth treatment that they stole from its rightful owner.  Unfortunately, they get into trouble when 3 of the Joes are turned into 7 year old kids and the other 3 are turned into old men. Now, they must regain their proper age and foil Cobra's evil plot.  The second worst episode of G.I. Joe I have ever seen.  The plot's stupid and there are gaping logic breaks (Beachhead  disappears off the face of the Earth when they go to the spa).  There are a couple good lines towards the beginning, & I loved seeing that zaranna still has feelings for Mainframe.  Of all the episodes that had to reference that one, why did it have to be such a bad one?  D-

83.  Brother's Keeper:  Sgt. Slaughter accompanies Sci-Fi to a science fiction convention, where Doctor Mindbender recruits a handicapped scientist named Dr. Jeremy Penser to perfect his latest weapon.  Again, a great spotlight episode, this time for Sci-Fi, who is another one of my favorite new characters this season.  What can I say; he's my kind of guy.  A

84.  My Favorite Things:  Serpentor goes on a quest to steal ancient artifacts belonging to history's merciless conquerors, which he intends to use to make himself invincible.  The only Joes who can stop him are Wet Suit and Leatherneck who must work together to foil their enemy.  One of the objects ends up destroyed by Leatherneck, causing Serpentor to poison him with deadly snake venom.  To save Leatherneck's life, Wet Suit and Lifeline go after Serpentor in order to obtain the same venom they need to create a venom antidote to save Leatherneck.  This episode was a little weird (I don't remember Cobra getting DNA from a lizard man) but it was still above average.  A-

85.  Raise the Flagg:  G.I. Joe and Cobra mount separate salvage operations to recover the sunken U.S.S. Flagg, only to find a former Cobra agent named Lakar and reprogrammed BATs occupy the Flagg and renamed it Lakar City.  B+

86.  Ninja Holiday:  Cobra Commander plots to find an assassin that he needs to eliminate Serpentor.  A-

87.  G.I. Joe And The Golden Fleece:  Joe and Cobra forces race to capture a golden coil dropped from a UFO and the device sends them back in time to ancient Greece, where they are mistaken for deities.  Personally, I loved this episode.  A+

88.  The Most Dangerous Thing In The World:  While General Hawk was attending a NATO meeting, Cobra hacks into the Defense Department's computer system and upgrades Shipwreck, Dial-Tone and Lifeline to the rank of Colonel.  A

89.  Nightmare Asault:  Doctor Mindbender creates a machine that turns the Joes' dreams into nightmares. Lowlight is the only person who can help his friends overcome their fears and foil Mindbender's evil plot.  A really good spotlight episode for Lowlight.  Plus, some of those nightmares were pretty scary, particularly Hawk's.  A+

90.  Second Hand Emotions:  Doctor Mindbender constructs a musical instrument to influence the Joes' emotions.  An even better spotlight for Lifeline.  A

91.  Joe's Night Out:  Leatherneck, Wet Suit, and Dial-Tone visit a new nightclub which is a Cobra rocket in disguise, sending the trio to space.  A humdrum episode.  C

92.  Not A Ghost Of A Chance:  Cobra is suspected of shooting down an experimental military jet and he Joes must prove that they are behind the attack.  It's always a great episode with Hector Ramirez.  A

93.  Sins Of Our Fathers:  Dial-Tone is dismissed from the Joe team and ends up helping Cobra Commander raise a monster from the ruins of Castle Destro in order to destroy Serpentor.  A

94.  In The Presence Of My Enemies:  When Slip-Stream is shot down by a female Strato-Viper near an abandoned Cobra laboratory, both hunt each other down.  Slip-Stream's spotlight is just as good as most of the others.  A

95. Into Your Tent I Will Silently Creep:  Cross-Country tries to track down the theft of Joes personal items and finds them being taken by robots. Among them was a game program Mainframe was working on simulating battle tactics.  A pretty good spotlight for Cross-Country, & not a bad episode to end the series on.  A-

As you can see, this is a much better batch of episodes.  The new characters were really cool for the most part, and the plots seemed more creative & less stupid than half of volume 1.  Towards the end, I got Season 1.2 so here's hoping it's just as good as this.  Yo Joe!",1388188800,10,8848,4.672976501305483
