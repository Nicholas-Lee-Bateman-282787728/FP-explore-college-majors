1615553,5,B00005K3OI,This movie was top of the charts in the romantic comedy catagory.  I was very impressed by all of the performances.  Ashley Judd was great and adorable as always.  And Hugh Jackman was Oooh-La-La.  If you liked him in this you just have to see him as Wolverine in X-Men.  This movie was a must see.  I'm only sorry I waited until it came out on video.,1001289600,,351,4.164179104477612
1615554,4,B00005K3OI,"I admit it: despite the fact that they are often banal, I am a sucker for romantic comedies. So I loved Someone Like You. I marvel at the story of boy meets girl, boy makes promises to girl and then -- for no apparent reason -- boy dumps girl.
I loved Animal Husbandry, the novel this film is based on. I thought the novel was witty, intelligent and fun. The film, though not as good as the novel, is delightful. Ashley Judd does a great portrayal of the obsessive Jane Goodall. Gregg Kinnear does a convincing role of the commitment-shy Ray and Hugh Jackman is adorable as the womanizer Eddie. However, Marisa Tomei and Ellen Barkin shouldn't have settled for such insubstantial supporting roles. They're such great actresses, after all.
The setback in the film is the ending. Like most films based on novels, the ending is altered. The ending in Animal Husbandry is subtle, whereas Someone Like You goes into dramatic mode. I know that films have to be more extravagant with the stories, but the ending here is too banal and sort of ruins the wit and fun approach the film had in the beginning.
Still, I think you should get together with a few female friends and enjoy this wonderful chick flick. (Men may want to steer clear from this one, for it has a bit of male-bashing in it.)",1001030400,18,1284,4.515021459227468
1615555,5,B00005K3OI,"Although this movie was somewhat formulatic, I found it worth watching. Ashley Judd does a wonderful job of playing the emotionally wounded main character, who gives her heart to Ray (Greg Kinnear), who then proceeds to step on it.
 Feeling angry and sad, she makes up theories, comparing men to cows. And she loses her apartment, which forces her to move in with womanizing coworker Eddie (Hugh Jackman), who has been sleeping around a lot, in order to cover up his emotionally damaged self.
 Anyway, you can sort of predict where the movie is going, but humorous dialogue and good chemistry make this movie a chick flick worth seeing :)",999993600,14,638,4.790909090909091
1615556,2,B00005K3OI,"That was the line uttered by Ashly Judd right before she does a completely absurd cheerleading cheer brought on by the prompting of her womaninzing roommate, Hugh Jackman. Just one of the many, quite funny, but intended to be cute, lines in this movie, which...wasn't very good.
BUT HEY!! I knew it wasn't going to be good. Y'see I was staying at a hotel and I love ordering movies, and they just didn't have that much of a selection. So, it was either Enemy at the Gates, a risky watch in my book, or a stupid romantic comedy that I could laugh at.
Guess what I picked.
So yeah, Ashly Judd is REALLY hot, so that was always nice. She really does have one of the prettiest smiles in the business. But she kept trying to be sort of Meg Ryan goffy and quirky, which became annoying on several occasions. Y'know she'd act like a five yr old. And I thought the the relationship between Marrisa Tomei and her seemed a little forced. And her big speech on TV at the end was completely ridiculous and anticlimactic. Very unsatisfying. And Ellen Barkin had a totall ridiculous role as well. Her speech about how she wooed her man back though was really great. ""Two pastrami sandwhiches...lightly toasted."" Just priceless.
So that was the bad stuff, and there was more than that too, but there was, to be fair, some good stuff. Mainly, and you'll like this Rino, Hugh Jackman. I thought he was great. So much fun to watch. A real prescence.  And funny too. He was great as the ""wounded"" womanizing roommate. I liked him more in this than I did in Swordfish. I think because he interacted more with people. Greg Kinnear was okay, but didn't have much to do. Ther were a few funny moments where they talked about the differences between women and men and why men ditch women they've already banged. So yeah, some of that was funny.
But overall? Bad.

I believe anyone will love this movie b/c Ashley is so CUTEEE",996969600,3,331,4.533333333333333
1615558,4,B00005K3OI,"Although this is about a love story which  eventually...doesn't work , Someone Like You contains more romantism than all of the similar comedies of the last year added together . After spending some time with collegue Eddie , Jane has come to the conclusion that men can never be faithfull to their lover . She's dissapointed with males and in order to give some logical explanation to her emotional troubles she starts comparing them well, with bulls .There's nothing better than to sit and watch Ashley Judd for a couple hours . She so beautifull , definetely one of the most appealing stars in Hollywood right now . When the whole thing is supported with a witty , original screenplay though ,the results are pure magic . Our heroine is human , imperfect and insecure and that's just what makes her seem so friendly to us . The suprise  here is Jackman who after  brutal comic-hero Wolfverine ,  delivers another very good perfomance and reveals a decent ( if nothing more ) talent in comedy . During a new year's Eve ceremony with Judd shouting  ""three , two , one "" with tears in her eyes ,comes the film's most touching moment . Although certainlty not the new masterpiece of the movie world ,Someone Like You will bring a smile in your face and make your evening ( maybe even your whole week ) seem somehow sweeter .",996883200,4,1323,4.542016806722689
1615559,3,B00005K3OI,"Having read and only somewhat liked ""Animal Husbandry"", the book on which this film is based, I was skeptical.  I had also heard horrible reviews of it, so to my surprise, I was entertained by this movie.
Ashley Judd plays Jane, a woman who undergoes a horrible breakup at the hands of Ray (Greg Kinnear).  In the aftermath, she comes up with ""Old/New Cow"" theory--essentially, that a man who has slept with a woman will thereafter get tired of her and move on to a ""new cow"".  Unlike the book, which details this theory in endless prose, the film cleverly uses titles and visuals of scientists testing this theory.
Ashley Judd isn't going to give Meg Ryan any fears about being dethroned as the romantic comedy heroine of choice.  But Judd is charming, intelligent, and quirky as the female lead, and Hugh Jackman is attractive and testosterine-filled as the womanizing Eddie, who eventually becomes Jane's roommate.
One minor quibble, and that's that the movie changes the ending of the book somewhat to give a somewhat artificially happy ending.  But who cares?  This is a light, pleasant romantic comedy that--dare I say it--actually improves upon the book.",994809600,46,1161,4.8979591836734695

1615577,5,B00005K3OI,"This is a sweet story about falling in love with the wrong person. Ashley Judd is pretty and endearing as a young woman trying to find love. She gets her heart broken and goes through a bit of a man-bashing phase, but eventually finds love again. I will agree with other reviewers about one thing: the ending seemed very rushed and not well thought-out. However, I'd give it 4 stars just for Hugh Jackman.

We get a glimpse of younger versions of Ashley Judd, Hugh Jackman, and Greg Kinnear, in a tale about love and disappointment and the lies large and small that some people are willing to tell others and themselves in order to get laid -- with or without commitment. It's a ""battle of the sexes"" that nobody actually wins, with some deeper lessons thrown in around the edges.

Worth a viewing if you are a romantic.  Judd and Jackman give us quirky, nuanced performances that carry the film in spite of a few unlikely plot twists.  The New Cow Theory may also make you smile, either with or without irony.",1474675200,,677,4.392

1616454,2,B00005K3OI,"So funny to watch these romantic comedies from a time gone by! The message this movie sends to women, man alive, how sad. Painful to continue to watch but great to see how far we have come as a human race",1462665600,,204,4.0
1616455,3,B00005K3OI,"It's a story that's not complicated to follow and it's the type of movie you would watch while unwinding on a Friday night. A quick summary: Jane meets Ray, this supposedly romantic, sensitive man who is going through a really rough patch with his girlfriend. They get involved, she falls head over heels in stupid love with him, they plan to move in together, and just like that without warning, he bails. Hurt, confused, and now living with her womanizing coworker, Eddie, Jane begins an obsessive ""study"" into human male behavior after reading a newspaper article and names her study ""New Cow Theory."" Adopting a pseudo identity as a sex and relationship expert, Jane has an article on New Cow published with the magazine her friend works for, and the country eats it up.

Some things I like about it: I like how the film shows that some people, like Ray, are two-faced. They show a heartfelt, genuine exterior in order to get what they want, and when they have gotten it, they let their true colors show that they're spineless, thoughtless cowards. This contrasts with Eddie, who, although a jerk on the surface, he is at least honest about his intentions, gives no false pretenses, and we are shown that he is so callous because he was badly burned by his previous relationship, if not more so than Jane. I enjoy juxtapositions like this between characters, and I thought it was played out well, especially with Greg Kinnear's and Hugh Jackman's performances. I also appreciated the fact that Jane admits on live television that she was ultimately wrong about her theory at the end of the film and that not all men are like Ray, which, let's face it, is very true. Moreover, Ray gets his comeuppance at the end of the film, or at least, we are hinted at it.

Some things I didn't like: The pacing felt a bit clunky and I was hoping for more romantic development between Jane and Eddie than there was so it didn't seem as left field at the end of the film. I also wish what happened with Eddie and his ex-girlfriend had been explained too so we would get to understand where he was coming from better. Then there was just Jane's personality. She annoyed me in some parts with her wishy-washiness and obsessive behavior over her broken relationship with Ray (to the point where it was downright childish and creepy), but as I read the book the movie was based after--""Animal Husbandry""--I can see that they made an effort to make her a sympathetic character in the movie and appreciate it. The book incarnation of Jane is an extremely insipid, shallow, tunnel-visioned woman who just leaves me thinking ""Well, no freaking dur lady"" every so often. What made her think hooking up with a taken guy who was verbally vomiting all over his fiancee behind her back was a good idea is still beyond me.

Anyway, I thought the movie was mildly entertaining and I would maybe watch it again with a friend who had never seen it before, and I would watch it with my mother because she did like it. One final thought I have to add is that this is just another one of Hugh Jackman's early films that serves as a prime example that he is a highly talented and versatile actor. It's a shame that since his debut as Wolverine in the X-Men movie franchise, it seems that he's been typecast.",1462665600,,3275,4.575809199318569

Ms. Judd is excellent in the role and the support cast completes the picture.  If you are looking for an action film, stay away.  If you are looking for a quite evening film that you can watch with a date, this easily fits the bill",1454198400,,385,3.9740259740259742

1616993,1,B00005K3OI,"Had to stop myself falling asleep,  Marisa Tomei's peppiness kept me going.  Hugh Jackman is a hunk and can act.  The rest of the cast, especially Ashley Judd could fall into a lake and I would not miss them.

Yet another White-on-White movie with a brain-dead plot. Hello Hollywood, could you liven things up a bit with some color diversity?  Its nice that you have an Aussie, but he's also very, very white!  What???  Is there no black talent around?  Or Asian?  Or Latino? Oh, I forgot!  They are reserved for the bad guy roles.  WAKE UP HOLLYWOOD, WE ARE TIRED OF THIS NON-DIVERSITY.  For comedies, it is always more fun to mix it up.  This is the UNITED states of America in case you forgot.

Apart from the irritation of white on white (no I'm not black), Ashley Judd cannot act.  She is herself no matter what movie role.  Same spoiled Southern Princess who must have her own way.  She looks drained, pale, and tired, like a party girl after a bash, in every frame.  Marisa Tomei by contrast, stole the show with her liveliness and joie de vivre.  I cannot imagine how two hunky men are pursuing her.  Ditch this pale faced frog and date Marisa instead.  Much more fun.

Plot limps along from bad to worse.  Ashley convinces no one, and is painful to watch.  Wake up Ashley!  And get some sun on your pale face!",1454112000,,1318,4.414225941422594

1617173,3,B00005K3OI,"The best part of this movie, to me, was when she was having a whirlwind romance with the guy and the very end of the movie. The acting was natural and believable.

My issue with the movie is the fact that so many people were smoking cigarettes in a movie that was made in 2001... come on now! Gangster and westerns might call for smoking, but not a romantic comedy where the plot does not lend itself to that kind of behavior. I also was offended by the multiple dead animal carcasses - so barbaric and disgusting... again, does not lend itself to a romantic comedy. Maybe if one of the characters was a butcher, but not this one. The cast was attractive, so why would they feel the need to put such unattractive visuals in this move?

Just not for me.",1451520000,,752,4.288732394366197

The story line unfolds without a feeling of any details being rushed, and because of that the cheesy factor is lowered.  There is no laughing out loud but the movie is light hearted and bright mostly, and not depressing, though there are some situations where sympathy for certain characters is brought about.

While some of the scenes required some effort to suspend disbelief--like, if you were a male co-worker's new room mate, would you really do a cheer for him in string bikini panties? Or even leave your bedroom in said panties. But anyway, it still manages to be innocent, somehow. Also ditto on suspending disbelief that someone with Judd's good looks and bubbly personality would have trouble keeping a man. But, OK, other than that...it was still a good movie in its way.

1618070,4,B00005K3OI,"Cute and funny movie. Nice to have playing in the background while doing paperwork or organizing paperwork at home towards the end of the day. The cow theory part was pretty funny. The only downside is how most of the men in the movie are portrayed as players and cheaters, with no females represented in the same way (if they are it is 'innocent' or a 'mistake'). I might be wrong though as I wasn't paying too much attention to it. Thankfully they have one guy who seems to be represented in a positive light. My review might be biased because I met my husband in the military and I only have one bad experience in a relationship that I can recall back in high school.",1446076800,,670,4.325396825396825

1618177,5,B00005K3OI,"It's all about Ashley Judd - absolutely her best performance - what a wide range of talent and humor. In this role, she's depressed, anxious, adorable, witty, sophisticated, ecstatic, goofy and wise. Although the film has its moments of over-the-top male-bashing - Judd pulls it off because she's so damn charming and likeable. Also, Jackman is the perfect juxtaposition to Judd's concept of the ideal man (it's obvious that he was destined to be a superstar).

The only question I have is - why didn't Judd do more light-hearted comedies? She's simply outstanding with her sense of comic-timing and her ability to carry a film. This is not the Ashley Judd of ""Double Jeopardy"" or ""High Crimes."" In this role, the director obviously set her free, and the result is an A++ performance from a true acting professional.",1445644800,2,816,4.913043478260869

I turned it off, utterly bored and unconvinced that anyone was emotionally committed to anyone else in the film, or ever would be. I didn't see any enthusiasm for their jobs. It was far too predictable, with nothing to keep me wondering (or caring) what the conflict in the movie was supposed to be, or if there would be a happy, more-or-less monogamous ending.",1445472000,,591,4.5233644859813085

1618447,2,B00005K3OI,I usually like Greg Kinnear a lot and love Hugh Jackman.  Ashley Judd can be good in some films and bad in others.  In this one she's bad...maybe just miscast or misdirected. .  There's a problem somewhere when Greg Kinnear is made to look dorky.  Also Marisa Tomei who is really beautiful in real life.  Hugh Jackman survives whatever was eating at the rest of the cast and manages to look great.  However the story is so lame that I bet all four actors would rather have their names excised from the credits.  I turned it off half way.,1445126400,3,537,4.363636363636363

1618631,2,B00005K3OI,"Eh. The lead actress is very charming, but even she can't really save the extremely uninspired plot.  They start with a framing device involving cows, don't ask, which they are very inconsistent with and totally mishandle.  If they had rigorously adhered to the logic of the framing device, like Monty Python always used to do with their absurd comedic routines, like the dead parent sketch, it could have been pretty cute. The framing device is unnecessary and should've been thrown away during the creation of the premise.  There is a secondary plot involving a fictional elderly lady PhD which is incredibly vapid. The acting is all perfect, nothing wrong with the film technique, direction, lighting, sound, music, or performances. But the insipid and illogical plot just does not work,  The characters are totally unbelievable  and you would not want to know them in real life, not at all.  The ending makes no sense, is a total clich, and is inconsistent with the established characterization.  Ashley Judd in the lead role is treated as if she were an incredibly attractive woman, but with that extremely ugly short haircut, and her plain Jane features, she is just about as attractive as a rock.  If you have a couple of hours to throw away, and have nothing better to do, sure, why not watch this movie? It's better than 75% of all the other crap that is out there. Which is not saying much.",1444867200,2,1400,4.780082987551867

Probably because I NOW know what amazing performers Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman, Marisa Tomei, and Ellen Barkin CAN be.  But they didn't really ""show up"" for this little romantic comedy -- all give B+ performances at best.  I would've given this a 4, but with a line-up like that, I would've expected more.  The plot and character development are malnourished.  The ending is very so-so.  Not bad (if you can get it for a bargain basement price), but not great.",1407628800,,533,4.557894736842106

How does this woman eat constantly and maintain that gorgeous figure?  Every woman who watches this movie will think, 'only in your dreams.'  Lots of sex, ah the liberated woman, but also as part of an example of how we can still not really trust each other until way further along than we think.

I talked to a veterinarian doctor, who has been dealing with cows a lot. He said: It is not the old""cow"" thing. There is a period of time ( lets say two weeks) when the cow will allow the bull to copulate with her as many times as he wants and he is using his time definitely. Once the time is over, the cow will not allow him to get close. So-o-o...it is different from what they are trying to say in the movie.

That said, I do appreciate drama for it's own sake, and there's enough of that here that it didn't put me to sleep.  I can believe in and even laugh at love mistakes, but I felt like the characters were trying too hard to deliver their punch lines.  Here's my plot summary, without divulging all.

Girl meets Mr. Right and is swept off her feet.  On the brink of cohabitation he announces he must go back to his wife/fiancee who (in unbelievable hijinks) turns out to be the girl's boss.  Our protagonist next proceeds to move in with a man she loathes (a co-worker), who's had (and is having) so many sex partners he qualifies as a walking condom ad.  Meanwhile our protagonist's girlfriend and she cook up a clever scheme for web-publishing her complaints about the man who dumped her and rationalizing his feckless infidelity must be linked to the breeding habits of the male of the species of domestic bovines.  The bull in her 'study' only mates once with each cow in the herd, afterward having nothing to do with each ""old"" cow.  It sounds funny enough

Lastly, the girls concoct a virtual identity for her authorship, adopting the internet persona of a European style Dr. Ruth (a sex therapist),  to lend a bit of trumped up Hippocratic authority to her diatribe.  Against all odds she falls for Mr. Condom king when her compassion is awakened by acquiring the insight that he too had fallen for that once-in-a-lifetime true love who became lost love.  That he too understood the crushing despair of an endless night, but that didn't force him to accept the loss alone.  To his amazement, he too finds himself vulnerable to her ingenuity and charm, to believing in she and he.

The girl is the one who kinda messes up and has to apologize and admit that she is wrong -- something that almost NEVER happens!  (And I'm a girl!

1619237,3,B00005K3OI,"Even the movie title's bland, am I right? When it was first being pitched, a romantic comedy featuring Ashley Judd and Hugh Jackman probably sounded like a solid no-brainer. But, without a good script, it not quite falls apart, but it does leave one with a feeling of ""Err. Huh. What?"" In the end SOMEONE LIKE YOU is a nice light romantic comedy, nothing more, nothing less. Something maybe worth catching on cable TV, but I don't know that I'd shell out money for the DVD. I didn't mind watching it, but the flaws were right there in your face.

Ashley Judd plays Jane, a producer on a daytime talk show and she thinks she'd met that special someone. Never mind that this guy (Greg Kinnear) already has a girlfriend. Jane and this guy hang out, hook up, get serious. But, on the verge of their moving in together into a new apartment, the guy breaks up with Jane. With Jane's old apartment already leased out to someone else, she takes up her co-worker Eddie's offer and becomes his platonic roomie in his spacious loft studio. And since Eddie (Jackman) is an unapologetic womanizer, Jane's regard for the opposite sex plummets even faster. One day, Jane reads an article in the paper and comes up with the ""new cow"" theory, this basically suggesting that a man always gets bored with banging the same woman and will always look for greener pastures. As a plot device to propel the story, it sucks. Instead of the lame pop psychology, a more apt theory is the one raised in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Harry-Met-Sally/dp/B00003CXDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Harry Met Sally</a>, which dictates that men and women can't be only friends.

Ashley Judd is sweet and yearning, and cute when her character is throwing a tantrum, and that one scene in which she performs a cheerleading routine while dressed in only her sexy scanties, well, that goes a ways in redeeming the movie for me. Hugh Jackman, back then fresh off playing the brutish and smelly Wolverine in X-MEN, doesn't come off as brutish or smelly here. This was before he landed those other romantic lead roles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kate-Leopold/dp/B0000640VN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kate & Leopold</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Australia/dp/B001PPGAIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Australia</a>) and before he hosted the Oscars - and I think most of us missed his star turn in OKLAHOMA! - so SOMEONE LIKE YOU may've been the first time we've seen him be all casually charming and cosmopolitan. Anyway, the two leads do the best they can with the shoddy material they're given, and they're appealing enough and go well enough together that they just about overcome a weak and lifeless plot. The supporting cast is good, and I can never get enough of Ellen Barkin and Marisa Tomei. Greg Kinnear is really excellent at playing the quietly sleazy part.

I like that Ashley Judd doesn't come off as too much of a weepy victim. But then she does get obsessed with drawing parallels between men and the bovine kingdom. She ends up publishing an article regarding her ""studies"" under the pseudonym of a much older woman. The kicker is that this article takes off and the mysterious author then becomes a much-in-demand guest star for the talk show circuit. It's dang uninvolving, the way this whole thing plays out, and the movie loses even more points for utilizing this plot device to resolve everything. The biggest flaw, though, is that the romance between the two leads comes out of nowhere. The film really could've done with more key moments to establish and develop Jane and Eddie's relationship. For most of the movie, Jane despises Eddie for his hound dog behavior, and Eddie just seems to cruise along his own merry way, bopping chicks left and right and not demonstrating one whiff of romantic interest for Jane. Then, late in the flick, Jane realizes that she loves him, and vicey-versy. It's a heck of a leap, and there's nothing truly suggested in Eddie's character that would indicate he's become a one-woman dude.

I do like the switcheroo aspect in that Kinnear's character is regarded initially as the sensitive, thoughtful guy only for him to turn out to be a weasely scuzzbucket. And then there's Jackman's Eddie, on the surface a shallow one-night-stand kind of cat but who does have a chivalrous side. And did I mention Ashley Judd in her undies jumping up and down doing a cheer? It's what makes this fluffy film relevant to me. Heck, I may end up buying the DVD after all.",1257897600,2,4601,5.098143236074271
1619238,4,B00005K3OI,"Broken hearted Jane develops her ""new cow theory"" about men; meaning that a man prefers being with a new woman and will always dump the old one. Through the funny details of the movie and with friends' help (I won't ruin the pleasure of you finding out for yourself,  by providing more details), Jane faces her pain and finds out that she can still find true love, the only analgesic for heartache.

The idea of starting over and admitting that not all men are faulty is very refreshing. After all, we women are the delusional ones who insist on pretending that the frog we're kissing is a knight and we place him on a white horse, then we act shocked when we find out he is still a frog.

The theme of the movie alone makes up for the cheesy performance and deserves 3 stars.

1619267,5,B00005K3OI,"The three main actors are perfectly cast. Ashley Judd plays Jane just right; a woman obsessed, yet a sympathetic character (who hasn't become obsessed over a breakup?). Greg Kinnear is perfect as the cheating, lying Ray, especially in the scenes where Ray puts a look of exaggerated emotion on his face, in an attempt to make himself believable.

When Jane moves in with Eddie, arguments are sparked over their respective attitudes towards relationships, but they have no problem coexisting in the same space. There are no arguments over cleaning the kitchen/bathroom/living room, no sniping about who left the front door unlocked, none of the usual friction that occurs between roommates, especially when one of them has lived in the apartment for some time and the other one is a newcomer.

Eddie and Jane, obviously, have different approaches to being dumped. Jane bemoans her fate and tries to find a reason for Ray's behavior in her books about animals. Eddie doesn't look for reasons, doesn't wait for his ex to magically return, and doesn't get into another relationship immediately. We don't know how long it's been since his girlfriend left him, but we know that his grief was so strong, he took an axe and chopped a hole in the wall of his spare room. Very powerful stuff for a man who's supposed to be unable to stay with one woman.

One of the reasons the movie works is that the two main characters learn from each other in recovering from their breakups. Eddie, in particular, draws in his own pain to help Jane with hers. ""It's over! Over! Why can't you just let it go?"" he asks her.

The real ace here is Hugh Jackman as Eddie, initially regarded by Jane as simply a womanizer, the stuff of legend around the office. Jackman faces a very difficult task in making Eddie not only believable, but sympathetic. The ""womanizing coworker"" has been done to death in film; Jackman's carefully shaded performance makes Eddie a real person. Eddie is never seen ogling a strange woman on the street, bragging about his sexual conquests, or behaving in any way as though he thinks he's superior to the women he beds night after night. There's nothing sleazy about him, and that's amazing.

Jackman successfully walks a fine line here; the movie is worth it for his performance alone. I wish they'd left the other ending, the one you can see on the DVD. It's much better and it really sizzles, making full use of the chemistry between the two leads.",1170288000,6,2452,4.746478873239437

1619286,2,B00005K3OI,"Jane Goodale (Ashley Judd) is the talent booker for 'Diane Richards Live', a New York talk show that has just been picked up for syndication. Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear) has just been hired from a Washington station as the new Producer. Eddie Alden (Hugh Jackman) is the writer/director of the show. Jane falls in love with Ray. Ray asks her to move in with him. Ray gets cold feet. Jane develops a theory about cows (don't ask). Jane becomes Eddie's roommate. Jane's attraction to womanizer Eddie grows as she also reconsiders Ray.

""Someone Like You"" is your basic girl-meets-boy-boy-becomes-jerk-can't-decide-whether-attractive-womanizer-is-the-right-guy story. We have all seen this story hundreds, if not thousands of times. If ""Someone Like You"" were just that, it would be a pleasant diversion starring attractive actors.

Unfortunately, Jane comes up with a theory about cows and their mating rituals. She finds that they are very similar to that of humans. Huh! Jane is the very young talent booker on a syndicated talk show. How did she become such an expert in biology? She buys a lot of books at Barnes and Noble and then lays on top of them. You think I'm kidding.

Because the ludicrous 'theories' that Jane Goodale (get it?) comes up with are referred to repeatedly, they completely undermine any chance that we might have to get to know or believe the characters were real. The theories keep bringing us out of the story.

Judd and Jackman are both very attractive and manage to generate some chemistry. Unfortunately, this is one of those stories in which we never see them kiss until the very end. I'm not really revealing anything here. You can tell this will happen from the very beginning.

""Someone Like You"" is supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet I only laughed a couple of times throughout. Not very successful. It is also a classic example of a 'chick flick'. However, calling ""Someone..."" a chick flick is as insulting as calling ""Exit Wounds"" a guy film. Neither film is any good and prescribing them to a particular group only insults that group.

Cute but familiar storyline... a perfectly reasonable expectation to really have a great time watching this one.

Add in director Tony Goldwyn (remember the treacherous villain in ""Ghost"" who is an entertainment blue blood - the ""G"" from MGM?) and I thought, ""Slam dunk but why haven't I ever heard of it?""

The movie itself is why I haven't ever heard of it.

Marisa Tomei - why hasn't she done more with her talent?

I am tired of her playing best friends of women she is smarter than - what is up with that? Ashley Judd is beautiful and has always appeared intelligent as well - what is up with the cheerleading in your underwear for your roommate scene?!

Ellen Barkin actually looked like she was having a great time in her role as the host of a television talk show.

I wonder what Ellen's character was doing with that DUD Greg Kinnear played?!

Jane then decides to move in with one of her co-workers just to get even at her ex-boyfriend.

Yes, humans are like bovines acording to this movie's theory (bulls will mate with several different cows, but not the same one). Does this sound romantic to you? Does it sound funny? It's neither romantic nor funny. Because the characters in this movie don't have good chemistry together. They barely seem to relate to each other on friendly terms.

She needs the reality check, not her dull and duller boyfriend.
Tomei was right when she tells Judd's character that it seems to be always about her. I would second that.

1619317,4,B00005K3OI,"""Someone Like You"" is a short and likable romantic comedy based on the novel ""Animal Husbandry"" by Laura Zigman. In order to make it a more palatable movie, director Tony Goldwyn de-fanged the sharp bite of the book where all men are deemed scum and there is no happy, Hollywood romantic pairing waiting for heroine Jane Goodale (played by Ashley Judd on screen). But to the benefit of the film, toning down the book's bile makes Jane less an unlikable, dithering neurotic and more of a likable kook.
Ashley Judd does an excellent job with the script by combining emotional vulnerability and a solid comedic presence. She is at all times cute and adorable without sending a viewer into sugar shock. Hugh Jackman, in his first post-X-men role, brings a certain roguish charm and charisma to the chain-smoking and chain-f***ing Eddie. Besides her co-worker and roommate, Eddie is also Jane Goodale's living, breathing proof of her wacky theory that men are neophiliacs, and lose interest in women once they have ""been serviced."" (She calls this her New Cow theory.).
When Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both on screen, the chemistry between them crackle. It adds a depth and nuance to their performances and characters' development. Too bad we are denied the pleasure of seeing them consummate their eventual (and very obvious) romantic pairing.
Greg Kinnear does a good job of combining slimy and sincere as the man who breaks Jane's heart, and starts her spiraling toward her New Cow theory. Marisa Tomei steals every scene she is in as Jane's enabler, best buddy, and fellow soldier in the romantic war. Marisa's chain-smoking Liz makes one wish that the movie was from her point of view, and that we could have watched cynical Liz trade verbal jabs and longing looks with Jackman's equally cynical Eddie.
The subplot concerning Alice's, Jane's sister,  infertility troubles doesn't add much to the plot of the movie except to show at least one man (Stephen, played by Peter Friedman) in a steady and monogamous relationship. Catherine Dent, who plays Danni in the F/X drama The Shield and Jane's sister, has the best line in the movie: ""If you can't stick [that needle] in a Valencia, how are you going to stick in my ass?""
""Someone Like You"" isn't as forgettable as the lame title suggests, because of top notch performances of its stars and some memorable lines. You want fall off your seat laughing, but you will find yourself with at least a pleasing smile on your face. A word to the wise, stop the movie 5 minutes before it is scheduled to end and you'll enjoy it even more.",1074211200,,2584,4.806741573033708
1619318,3,B00005K3OI,"This movie has lots of ups and downs, high and low moments. The beginning is with the very original cow theory showing real cows and scientists and in a way promising us that this is not going to be just another regular love story. Then the film moves on to a very banal story, where the ""villain"" is marked from moment one. Somewhere along this line you get hooked until the once again banal (and too dramatized) ending.
All in all fun and entertaining to watch but not one of the best romantic comedies. Ashley Judd as the dumped lady is lovely and is a good excuse to watch this film. I liked this actress since watching her in ""where the heart is"", but I have to say she does not really look miserable, or maybe I wish I looked like her when I was miserable (actually, I would not mind looking like that when I am happy either). Other then that I could not stand Gregg Kinnear as the love object, he seemed too pathetic to win anybody's heart. I liked him a whole lot better as the neighbor in ""As good as it gets"" - in that movie his pathetic expressions seemed to fit the role. Marisa Tomei is lovely as the best friend role.
During the viewing I wondered how such a hectic and demanding work at a television network seems to take up so few hours of the hero's daytime. I wonder.",1072742400,2,1285,4.227642276422764

I really like Ashley Judd as well, although she has never acheived the brilliance she brought to her role in the film ""Ruby in Paradise"".  She seems hell-bent on becomming a ""movie star"" at this point in time.
Anyway, this movie was really stupid, the cow & bull theory, what a bunch of, you should excuse the expression, BULL.  Everything was dumbed down & stupid to the extreme. Don't get me started on Ashley's ridiculous get ups!  My favorite was the strapless daytime dress for the office, give me a break!
Everyone in this movie was a cipher.  There was no plot, no character development, no romantic chemistry between the lovers, nothing.
Ashley Judd appeared so emaciated, that she looked ill,and I don't mean love sick.
It looked like everyone in the movie just showed up to collect a paycheck.
However, Hugh Jackman did look FABULOUS in his scivies.",1064448000,4,1006,4.791907514450867
1619321,5,B00005K3OI,"I can't help it.  Even though this is basically a chick-flick, I loved it.
  I guess someone like Sandra Bullock or maybe Jennifer Anniston could have pulled off Ashley's role as Jane Goodall (no relation to the gorilla woman) - after all, chick-flick-chicks are pretty interchangable.  But there's something about Ashley Judd that makes you sit up and think, gosh, this girl (woman, I guess) is just a little different.  I'm gonna pay just a little more attention to this one.
  Maybe it's the way her character interacts with the other actors.  She's working with ""professional supporting actors"" Greg Kinnear and Marisa Tomei, not to mention the future Wolverine Hugh Jackman.  None of their characters, as Jane's love interest, best friend, and roommate, respectively, have any reason to exist except to provide Ashley with opportunities to be adorable.
  The screenplay is genuinely witty.  There's one scene in which Ashley finds her diaphragm, which she has apparently been keeping in storage, and blows dust off it.  That single action tells you more about her character's life than twenty pages of dialog.  Another hilarious bit has Greg Kinnear's character reciting an imaginary ""deconstruction"" of male manipulation techniques in terms of Jane/Ashley's ""New Cow Theory.""
  Ashley makes acting in a piece like this look easy, unlike Marisa Tomei, whose over-the-topness makes you a little conscious of the fact that she's ""on"" (don't get me wrong -- Marisa's cute, too, but she's no Ashley!).
There's a scene in which Ashley has to run.  We all know that Ashley can run like frickin' Prefontaine.  Yet she's playing a ""girlie"" girl, so she hams it up just enough, with the skidding and arm-waving, so that she looks like a puppy who can barely make it to its dish without banging into the refrigerator.

but come to think about our normal lives, we all do it, especially with our love lives!. we always try to rationalize everything in life, and give explains to everything, and truth is, sometimes you just gotta play this game, without asking yourself ""why am I doing this, or that"", and just enjoy yourself.
thats the whole essence of that movie! thats why its not extremely catchy, sticky and everything. it avoids from being pretentious, or delivering this never-been-seen-before plot. thats your avarage life, right there!!. it convies you with a sweet feeling in the end, which being passed throughout bitterness, sharpness and with just a bit of sticky sweet love. just like in real life, where buying a guitar for some girl won't make it up to the fact that you've been paid for asking her to the prom. those stories do accour in life.",1051660800,,1554,4.418118466898955

1619344,5,B00005K3OI,"This is a great romantic comedy. I wouldn't say that it's surprising or rip-roaring hilarious, but it is different.  It's not your typical girl meets boy, they don't like each other, then they fall in love routine.  This one is a threesome of sorts, which adds an interesting angle ... or triangle as the case may be.  Ashley Judd plays PR person (or something of that nature - her title isn't named) Jane Goodall for a sleazy Sally-Jessie-esque talkshow in NYC. Ellen Barkin turns in a very good performance as the sleazy talkshow host. Also working at this talkshow set are Ray (Greg Kinnear) and Eddie (Hugh Jackman).  Kinnear's boyish good looks and charm make it easy to believe that Judd's character falls in love with him quickly, but make a little surprising to find that he's such a pig ... er, bull.  The animal comparisons that underlie the entire plot add a lot of spice to this quintessential chick flick.  And I do mean chick flick, if ever there was one.  This is one of those movies where women who have ever had their hearts broken can cheer Judd on in her emotional journey (and breakdown).  Men without a sense of humor may be a bit offended or take exception to the premise, but all comes out well in the end as in all romantic comedies. Hugh Jackman gives a stellar performance as a hunky womanizer with a sensitive side.  Ashley Judd is her usual perky, plucky, sweet self in this film, and her comedic timing is good too.  Greg Kinnear, as previously mentioned, was a good choice for his role as the third main character in this love triangle. Also worth mentioning is the lesser part played by Marissa Tomei, as Jane's best friend Liz.  Tomei is as good as ever, even in this small supporting role -- and so adorable! I own this DVD and have seen it at least five times -- it's a definite buy for any woman who is a fan of romantic comedies.",1050537600,6,1865,4.455882352941177

I think that was a big letdown.  Kinnear and Judd are fun and so is Ellen Barkin but the movie sort of stretches out this animal husbandry premise so long that the two main dating relationships for Judd are cut off before a thorough examination by the audience is available.,1048118400,,599,4.5607476635514015

It is everything that a romantic comedy should be, and it doesn't get too predictable, like most romantic comedies, where you can just tell what will be said next. It's not like that in this one. It's charming without trying too hard, sentimental, and actually SINCERE, not overly gushy, and funny, without being cheesy. The acting is perfect, and I really couldn't find one thing to complain about, everything flows together. Ashely is brilliant. She's the future of female acting in Hollywood(along with Renne Zellwegger), and proves that she is a comedian. Hugh Jackman is just wonderful, not to mention sexy as freakin hell. I am in love.and Greg Kinnear, and Marisa Tomei are fabulous as well. This movie is reccomended to anyone who wants to enjoy great comedy. I'm not bulls**tting ya.

1619348,5,B00005K3OI,"This is honestly the best romantic comedy I've ever seem, at least in recent memory. When people say this movie is predictable, I want them to ask themselves this, is there a romantic comedy, where you have absolutely no idea how things will turn out?I think that answer would be no, and while here you do have the basic idea on how things will turn out, that's basically it. Many romantic comedies these days are so shallow and predictable, that you can just tell what each character is going to say. Ok, so lets get to the point. The movie starts out with a talent scout for an aspiring national network, tabloid television show,Her name is Jane Goodale,(played by Ashely Judd).Within 10 minutes of the movie, she meets coworker Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear), and right away sparks are flying between the two. After a few dates the two start dating, and are on the verge of moving in together. But after Ray breaks up with his girlfriend(whom he was cheating on with Jane), things start to change. The romance is definately wearing off, and Ray seems to be avoiding Jane. Then Ray breaks the big news,he ""can't do this"".Of course Jane is left completely crushed, and also without a place to live(her apartement has been re-rented, and she and Ray are obviously not moving together).Which brings us to the third of the main chracters, Eddie(played by Hugh Jackman).Eddie is another one of Jane's co-workers, and he is your typical womanizer. Well, as it turns out, Eddie is in search of a roomate, and Jane jumps at the chance,mainly to make Ray jealous, and also because she doesn't have a place to live. The relationship with Eddie starts out with them constantly bickering, and complaining about one another's behavior. But, slowly, the two start to unravel, and a more understanding relationship develops between them .Meanwhile,Jane, still broken-hearted from her sudden breakup with Ray, is obssessed. There seems to be no way to put her mind at rest, because Jane needs a reason, on why she was so suddently dumped by the man of her dreams. And then she discovers what she feels explains everything-""The Cow Theory"".In this theory, it is explained the men leave their women because the newness simply wears off, and the men want ""new cow"".Jane becomes obssessed with this theory, because it seems to give her a reason as to why the relationship of herdreams so suddently ended. A little more into the movie,Jane's best friend(played by Marisa Tomei), who works for a magazine, gives Jane an idea. To publish a story on this ""cow theory"", under a pseudonym. Well, Jane chooses to be the a 72 year old Phd, Marie Charles. What Jane doesn't expect is how the story just suddently blows up into a national phenomenon. Before she knows, ""Marie Charles"" is to appear on Jane's television show. This leads to a discovery, and a newfound happiness.
I won't spoil the ending for you. The performances are just awesome. As far as I'm concerned, Ashely is the next big thing. Forget the overrated Julia Roberts. Ashely is hilarious, but when needed, her emotion is raw and real. Hugh Jackman wittily handles his role. And Greg is perfect as Ray, the seemingly inocent,perfect guy. To anyone who likes good comedy, or just good movies, then I recommend you see this movie. It's really  a hilarious,charming,just excellent comedy.",1045180800,,3320,4.824561403508772
1619349,3,B00005K3OI,"With an all-around talented and stellar cast, this movie really should have had a better script.  With so much storyline potential, there never was enough character development to truly engage the viewer.  I kept wanting to know more about why Hugh Jackman's womanizing character Eddie was the way he was; we are given only a small taste of what drives him.  The superbly talented Jackman, however, makes the most of his role, bringing to his character more depth than I thought possible in such a superficially written role.  The story is predictable, but there's not necessarily anything wrong with that; watching it, you want it to end the way you know it's going to end.
Ashley Judd is immensely likeable as Jane in the first light romantic comedy role I've ever seen her in, and Greg Kinnear is spot-on as the guy who creates Jane's emotional turmoil.  Ellen Barkin appears to have had the most fun in her role as a ratings-hungry talk-show host.  Judd and Jackman have excellent on-screen chemistry.  I just wish the movie delved a little deeper into its characters to make me actually feel what they were feeling; everything was a little too light in its treatment, and therefore held my interest only mildly.",1042588800,,1216,4.8173076923076925

1619353,2,B00005K3OI,"It's sad in a way, that the movie's this bad, because it shouldn't be. The stars are likeable. Production values are good. There are a few witticisms.
But right underneath are some really nasty ideas, all of them hugely sexist in that ""men are evil"" way that gives chick flicks a bad name and should offend anyone who sees them.
The plot of ""Someone Like You"" is simple:  ""Men are evil.  Just kidding. The end.""
So, OK, the movie isn't the worst ever made.  Teeny, tiny Size-Zero Ashley Judd is funny and appealing in the cookie-cutter Meg Ryan part (although her character chomps cookies nonstop through the movie -- like *that's* realistic).  Hugh Jackman is likeable and very funny. That's about it.  Marisa Tomei is criminally wasted as Ashley's friend (I just hope she got a good paycheck for such a thankless part), but she looks gorgeous.
But that's about it. The movie's really sexist at heart, and in a continuing trend, somehow the whole idea that ""Men are evil"" is supposed to be cute and inoffensive, where any film claiming the opposite would certainly have us women yelling pretty loudly.  It's offensive.  No, men aren't evil, they're not bulls, and movies like this aren't as smart or witty as they think they are.  Which is a shame, because it has a few charming moments in all the hypocrisy that had me wishing they'd simply paid the writer a few bucks for a better film.
So much for the ""chick flick"" theory.  We all deserve better than stupid, badly written movies with terrible marketing campaigns and overpaid actresses.  I mean, REALLY.  When did it become OK for a 2-star movie to get 5 stars simply because people are desperate for a little light entertainment?  What if, instead, we said, ""Nah, movie's not so good, we deserve better than this cookie-cutter dreck""?  Just a thought.",1035158400,8,1808,4.719745222929936

Of course, the story is important and unfortunately, that is where the problem is.  I guess I was enjoying the film but the ending...well...
Let's just say that director Tony Goldwyn, said it best during his commentary in the alternative ending sequence.  Three different endings, not enough time to do the endings and the difficulties of trying to end the movie in a good note.
For me, the endings were fast and swift as romantic movies were back in the 50's and 60's but in this day and age, you expect the movie to really make you smile and feel good.
This one left me feeling.... well, that the ending was ok.
Each character did a good job and Judd's acting seems to improve with each film.  But sometimes I felt the acting from Judd, Tomei and even Jackman was not in par as they have been in other movies.
But what I did enjoy is director Tony Goldwyn (yes, the main baddie of ""Ghost"") talk about the movie.  It would appear that there were things working against them and I really enjoyed his comments especially the commentary on the deleted scenes and alternative ending.  The kind of information that striving director's want to hear about during these commentaries.

1619358,2,B00005K3OI,"When I slipped ""Someone Like You"" into the machine, I admit I didn't have an open mind.  I was predisposed to like the film for several reasons: mainly Hugh Jackman, the hunky Aussie who grabbed American filmgoers' attention as Wolverine in ""X-Men.""  I'm also a longtime fan of Greg Kinnear -- hey, I remember him as the original host of ""Talk Soup"" -- and liked the Laura Zigman novel ""Animal Husbandry,"" the basis for this film.
So my disappointment at the failure of this film is great indeed.
I can't lay the blame at the feet of any of the actors -- Jackman, Kinnear, Ashley Judd and Marisa Tomei gave it their best shots.  But good actors can only do so much with a scattered script that provides little explanation for the action, not to mention jerky editing that leaves plot lines dangling.  Had I not read Zigman's work, I wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on.  Those not inclined to visit the library or buy the book here will likely have trouble comprehending the storyline -- co-workers Kinnear and Judd begin a whirlwind romance that ends just before they move in together, which forces the apartment-less Judd to then become co-worker Jackman's roommate, with whom she forms a prickly friendship while using animal behavior (specifically that of cows and bulls) to explain Kinnear's stupidity.  What was charming in novel form becomes tiresome onscreen, and the film didn't provide enough glimpses of the magnificent Jackman, who is arguably one of the most attractive actors working today, to maintain my interest.
I reluctantly rate ""Someone Like You"" a C-minus.",1024790400,6,1597,4.874538745387454

The story is disjointed and pointless; the characters were terribly underdeveloped and shallow. None of them were really very likeable, especially the men.
I realize that the movie was from the book ""Animal Husbandry"" but the cow and bull stuff just did not work. The whole movie was just plain excruciating.
What also did not work was the love triangle, perhaps because both men were slimy weasels. Who would want either of them, cute though they are?

Plus, the romantic parts were below average and the ending was disgustingly sappy. Both of the men in this movie were slimeballs (one was cheating on his girlfriend with Jane, the other slept with a different girl each night). There are a few redeeming qualities; for instance, Ashley Judd is a decent actress-she seems more down to earth than many other actresses out there. However, there is little that can save this movie-the plot is cliche and not very funny. The DVD also is lacking when it comes to extra features-it only has a few lame extended scenes and an alternate ending that is even mushier than the original ending.

There are some amusing little quirks in the style of the film, captions before certain ""chapters,"" little fantasy flashes and whatnot, that I really enjoyed. I also liked the chemistry between Jackman and Judd, which wasn't melt-the-screen hot, but still worked very well.
Ashley Judd has turned into a fine actress. One scene crystalized this for me - she is crying on the bed, and Jackman is sitting next to her, trying to comfort her. He says something particularly touching, and Judd completely breaks down into heart-wrenching sobs, and doesn't try to make it look ""pretty,"" doesn't try to cover her angst-twisted face with her hands like so many actresses do - she honestly looks like she has a heart broken into a zillion pieces, and conveys the pain of her character's experience exceptionally well.
Hugh Jackman, while drop-dead gorgeous and indeed talented as well, needs to work a bit on his ""tender"" scenes - he occasionally went a bit over the top with the doe-eyed goofy thing, much like Leonardo DiCaprio did in ""Titantic"" (but let's not go there, shall we?)

This doesn't mean that it's an unpleasant way to spend an evening. It means it's forgettable. It is like one of those people you meet at a party who is nice enough to be around but whose face you can't remember the next day.
Romantic comedy is a tricky genre. If you stick closely to the formula, you risk making a totally uninspired movie. If you tinker too much with the recipe, you risk losing the audience because it is a subject where people tend to want to see the same story over and over again, only slightly differently each time. Occasionally, there's a successful variation, as in 1997's delightful romp, My Best Friend's Wedding, where girl met boy, girl lost boy, girl tried everything to get boy back but lost him anyway. Such movies don't endanger the formula, though, because we almost always want the couple to wind up together.
Someone Like You's device is the old love triangle. Jane [Ashley Judd] works for a New York TV talk show. The show is about to go national, and Jane's one of the people responsible for making this transition a success. She's a girl who's looking for a long term relationship, and she is appalled by Eddie [Hugh Jackman], a coworker who makes conquest after conquest with female members of the staff. She seems to be the lone holdout. Ray [Greg Kinnear] arrives as the show's new producer. He seems so gentle and understanding, and Jane is instantly attracted to him. Soon, they begin a serious affair and decided to move in together. Just as Jane is about to move out of her apartment, Ray gets cold feet. Angry and hurt, Jane impulsively agrees to move in with the notorious Eddie, hoping to have her revenge on Ray. Jane and Eddie vow to be platonic with each other. Will Jane get Ray back? Or will Eddie show her he has another side to him, one that's much more appealing?
There is a subplot in the movie that might have seemed hilarious on paper. It doesn't translate well to the screen. While watching TV documentaries about the mating habits of various mammals, Jane learns that a bull will not mate with a cow he's already done it with. He needs a new cow. In one of the great leaps for sociology and anthropology, Jane concludes that this behavior explains why men cannot be faithful. Using a pen name, she writes about it in a column for a magazine, and, this being a movie, she's syndicated in three hundred newspapers a week later. This causes a lot of problems for Jane. It's also trouble for the audience because the idea is so fundamentally weak. If this is the reason men can't be faithful, then it's a natural phenomenon, so why are we still worrying about it?
As has often the case in recent movies of this type, a supporting role steals the show. Ellen Barkin plays Diane Roberts, the host of the talk show. She's ambitious, self-centered and wise. She's also very funny and a lot more interesting than the main characters. Her performance alone is worth giving She's the One a look.",1017705600,2,3061,4.537070524412297
1619406,4,B00005K3OI,"Star quality and old-fashioned sex-appeal are the highlights of Someone Like You, a fairly predictable romantic comedy than nonetheless tugs at the heartstrings with surprising effectiveness. Ashley Judd is Jane, a talent-booker for a talk show host who has her heart broken by the show's producer (Greg Kinnear). To spite her ex, Jane moves in with Eddie (Hugh Jackman) another staffer who needs a roommate. The results, of course, are predictable. We all know that Jane and Eddie are bound for romance, but the screen-sizzle between Judd and Jackman is more than worth it. Also worth the price are the special features on the DVD, which include an alternate ending which, thankfully, was not used.
While Someone Like You won't win any points for originality, it does score big-time for romance and chuckles. While it's definitely not Oscar-quality, it is probably worth owning, especially for the occasional romantic date night.",1016409600,3,930,5.206666666666667
1619407,1,B00005K3OI,"Someone Like You is an example of a truly horrible movie.  The movie is based on a premise that men are like bulls and must move from woman to woman just as bulls move from cow to cow, never staying with the same one.  The movie is structured around this theme.  The great cast features Ashley Judd as Jane, the woman behind the bull and cow theory.  She is jilted by Ray (Greg Kinnear), who moves onto another ""cow.""  She moves in with Eddie (""Hugh Jackman"") for financial reasons.  She builds her theory around Eddie.  Eddie sleeps with and discards women all the time as if they mean nothing to him.  In the end Jane and Eddie get together and pronounce they love each other.
This movie is horrible because of Eddie.  Actually the writers are to blame.  It is established early on that Eddie is a womanizer.  Then the movie hints at the reason behind this, showing him encountering his old girlfriend at a yoga class.  We sense they have a history and that this may have something to do with why Eddie is the way he is.  But we never find out why Eddie can't committ to a relationship.  Then with a worthless plot point about a miscarriage, Jane supposedly realizes that men aren't the problem, she is.  She throws herself at Eddie and we are left wondering why?  He's just going to use her like all of the other women he has.
This movie needed to show some depth to the characters.  Most of this movie made no sense because the characters did some of the dumbest things.  Besides, if you do watch this movie, you'll realize how stupid that whole bull and cow theory is.  A movie based on a stupid premise cannot be saved when that premise is rejected.  How can you take a woman like Jane seriously if she believes all men everywhere are like bulls.",1015200000,5,1752,4.381987577639752

1619411,3,B00005K3OI,"""Someone Like You"" means Ashley Judd, no matter how its script implies.  Her charming smile accompanied with skillful acting is the best thing you can find in this movie.  Fans, enjoy it.
Still, ""Someone Like You"" is a little disappointing.  The movie makes you feel good, certainly, and supporting cast is good (though Greg Kinnear seems typecast after ""Nurse  Betty,"" ""Sabrina,"" and others) and the beautiful location shots of New York City is impressive.  However, we have seen a film with a better script this year (2001) and because of this fact, one star drops.  And the film is, of course, ""Bridget Jones's Diary.""
Both movies goes on the similar course during their running time.  Two guys and a working woman; she loves one guy, but comes to know that he doesn't love her; then she finds another love, and during the course she struggles hard to make her career....  The critics' lukewarm reception of ""Someone Like You"" is fairly understandable, if slightly unfair.  Even without this comparison, the flaw (probably the only flaw I can find) of ""Someone Like You"" is clear; it gives nothing new.  And if you start to think about ""Dairy,"" you might all the more miss the witty script of the latter movie.
Having said that, ""Someone Like You"" is a likable and funny film that promises you to have a good time.  Judd's strangely convincing ""Bull-Cow Theory"" is funny, and for me the best part of the story is the conclusion of the film -- humans are NOT bulls nor cows.  Some people theorize on human relationships in a bleak way, but ""Someone Like You"" assures that we are all humans, not animals.  (British title of the film happens to be ""Animal Attraction.""  Oh....)  Besides ever-wonderful Judd, Hugh Jackman displays his deft performance for romantic comedy, and you can try to spot Ashley's real-life mother.  And the most unexpected joy is to watch (though briefly) Judd plays a cheerleader in an unusual situation.  Enjoy the film.",1009670400,,1947,4.816265060240964
1619412,3,B00005K3OI,"I am a connoisseur of romantic comedies, and I read and enjoyed the overdone fluff that was Animal Husbandry, so I must say that I was kind of looking forward to seeing Someone Like You. It stared the usually enjoyable Ashley Judd and The Delicious Hugh Jackman, so I couldn't pass it up, right?
The plot is fairly simple: Jane Goodale falls for Ray, Ray dumps Jane after telling her he loves her and wants to move in with here, leaving Jane brokenhearted and without an apartment. Desperate, Jane moves in with Eddie, a chain-smoking womanizer with a GREAT loft. Jane formulates a theory on why men leave women based on observed animal behaviors, called the New Cow Theory. Things with her theory get out of control, and Jane suddenly falls in love with Eddie.
And I do mean SUDDENLY. I'm going to rant a little about this movie's classification as romantic comedy. As anyone who is a fan of the romantic comedy knows, it's code for Modern Day Fairy Tale. It doesn't have to be something that would happen to real people. But if the characters in the movie believe it, it doesn't matter. Let's face it; romantic comedies are not about surprises. They are predictable. We know that the two main characters are going to fall in love and kiss at the end of the movie. This was a movie that was based on a non-romantic comedy, and it shows. Having two people kiss at the end doesn't automatically make it romantic. It's not about the kiss. It's about Everything That Leads to The Kiss. Getting there really is the fun. It's the First Commandment of the romantic comedy. Someone on this project forgot that.
Okay, I'm done.
That said, I should have passed it up. Someone Like You gets off to a bad start, featuring a voice over by Ms. Judd (I warn you, voice-overs are the main mode of plot movement in this flick). It was more than obvious that poor Ashley didn't believe a word she was saying, and that's pretty much what happened through the whole movie. No one was buying into the story, and the romantic leads were all wrong for each other. Judd and Greg Kinnear? Yuck. Of course, I don't like Greg anyway, but still, yuck.
Someone like you isn't ALL bad. It does have its moments. There was, of course, The Delicious Hugh Jackman.. While I am not a die-hard fan of Marisa Tomei (Jane's best friend), I must say that she was done up quite beautifully for her role, and she seems to have toned down her Rosie Perez-esque New Yorker attitude just a touch. There was also one particularly touching scene, following Jane's sister Alice's miscarriage, when Alice's husband came into the hospital room and told Alice that she was still the most beautiful woman in the world. The way they looked at each other...they bought it. And I got teary. To think, the one thing that got me teary was from a subplot that wasn't in the book at all.
So I'm giving Someone Like You three stars: one for The Delicious Hugh Jackman, who is always just plain fun to watch (on so many levels...X-men anyone?); one for Ms. Tomei's well done makeup and wardrobe; and one for the eternally romantic hospital scene. All in all, it's a skipper. I'm glad I rented it first. See Say Anything, When Harry Met Sally, or Notting Hill instead.",1009324800,9,3209,4.5344827586206895
1619423,4,B00005K3OI,"There are two major reasons to see this movie.  They are Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd.  Both of these actors have real sizzle for a romantic comedy-drama blend.  In fact, Greg Kinnear, playing a third major character, although necessary to the plot line, doesn't strike me as a likely romantic lead at all. Kinnear's getting 2nd billing in the film surprised me.  I think Jackman can wipe him right off the screen romantically speaking.  The script is a bit predictable with Judd's character falling for Kinnear. Then, when he is torn about going back to his original girlfriend, she develops a bizarre theory about why men are like cows and bulls.  She even writes a column on it for a major magazine.

I thought the movie got better as it progressed, which is unusual, but I think the reason why was that Jackman was in more of the movie from the second half on and his screen charisma really made a difference.  I think if someone casts him as the total romantic lead in a romantic movie from start to finish, he will have quite a following. Ellen Barkin plays a supporting role in the film as everyone's boss, a talk show host.  I miss her taking on weightier roles. Van Morrison's ""Someone Like You,"" closes the film and is a perfect endnote.

Please hear me out. This is exactly why the modern romantic comedy has become so stale, so dishonest in emotional character, and so not worth watching any more.
Let's all be honest here. The dialogue is lousy, the chemistry between Judd and Jackman non-existant, and the ending is implausible not because it's ""against the odds"" but because there was no development of the relationship that would leave you to believe that these people actually cared about one another. It's just not fun. Ashley Judd, who's done some good work in the past (no really, see ""Ruby in Paradise""), and who has a really cute, likeable screen presence can't really need the money that badly.
Really, just do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie - it'll only encourage the studios to bang out trite, by-the-numbers, poorly directed, sleep-walk acting filled movies like this. Break the cycle! Demand better for your hard-earned dollars and maybe the studios will put a little more thought, honesty, and fun into the modern romantic comedy.

1619429,1,B00005K3OI,"This movie was not promising from the beginning. You know when Marisa Tomei, who reminds me of a Female-Italian Woody Allen wannabee, begins analyzing yet another relationship dynamic. Now she has enlisted the help of 21-forever Ashley Judd. Of course it is Ashley who comes up with this new-age bunk that becomes the ""bible of the month"" to women who always seems to get dumped on. I got a good one for you women. Date a man uglier than you and he will be faithful forever.
Ashley Judd plays Jane Goodale (not the one that saves the monkey), a self absorbed TV booker for a tabloid talk show a-la Sally Jesse Raphael. She seems to have things going well in her life, when she meets Ray Brown, a loveable guy who is new the job. He's in a three year relationship but of course it is ho-hum. So he initiates an relationship with Jane and they get hot and heavy. Two months later (although in the movie it is more like 4 minutes), they move in together. But nay...Ray gets cold feet and runs back to his sweetie.
This leaves Jane in a bind and heartbroken. She has given her notice (and in NYC you're screwed if you do that...trust me) and is forced to roomie with the company playboy/badboy/chauvenistic pig. The pig (or bull) is Eddie Alden, played by Hugh Jackman who looks like a cross between Tim Daly/Wayne Gretzky and Scott Baio and he is the little playboy, seemingly picking up all the sleazy women. This of course infuriates the hurt Jane and she focuses her thoughts on why guys leaves women. Hence her ""new cow"" theory. Her theory goes like this....Men are the bull and women are the cows. The bull will shack up with the new cow, but once he has spread his seed, he will look for the ""new cow"" and never touch the now ""old cow"". I guess this is one of Darwins theory of evolutions brought to mainstream pop culture/new age.
Of course, the roomies become closer and the inevitable begins to happen. Jane's article which appears in a magazine makes her the talk of the town and she finds happiness with the man she thought she would never want to hook up with....
This movie stank on all levels. First, the psychology makes no sense. They throw some dubious facts and call it reality. This ""new cow"" theory I guess would make no sense in places like Asia, where the divorce rates are less than 10%. I guess half the Americans who live monogamously would find this bunk laughable, as would those men who want to be monogamous. What about ""new bull"" syndrome? Don't cows also leave bulls to be with other bulls? Give me a break.
Even worse than this silly theory/philosophy is the script. Jane is given a little treatment and we do feel a little sympathy for her blindness (cause we all probably did a ""Goodall"" once in our lives), but her relationship with Ray is passed over so quickly, that many of my friends agreed that Jane and Ray never developed a bond with each other. I mean, in the couple of scenes, they have sex and BOOM, they move in together!? The other failed relationship is between Jane and Eddie. They pretty much stay out of each other's hair. She hates Eddie for the way he is, because he proves her theory right, but there should be at least a little sexual tension or flirting right? Nothing. They just kiss at the end because the script called for it. I didn't even know that they were in to each other at that point.
This movie attempts to be a Sex in the City, but it is contrived and never develops into anything. I know that this was based on a book, but if the book is anything like this stinky movie, I would recommend that you try something better....like Chocolat.....Rating: D",1005696000,8,3616,4.447289156626506
1619430,3,B00005K3OI,"Granted, the novel upon which this romantic comedy is based (Animal Husbandry) is much more intricate and intelligent then what appears on screen here, but for the casual viewer on a rainy night it's a satisfying and perky little movie that hits all the right buttons and then sends you home feeling cozy. Ashley Judd plays an assistant to a go-getter television host (Barkin) who falls in love with a new co-worker (Greg Kinnear) and embarks upon the best relationship of her life with him. After selling her apartment to move in with him, she discovers that it's over between them and the only place she can find to live on such short notice is rooming with her oversexed, bad attitude work colleague (Hugh Jackman), a guy who goes from one girl to the other in an effort to prove that the true love he once had with his girlfriend doesn't exist. While moping around in her misery, our heroine stumbles upon a theory that equates men and their need to swap partners with research done on bulls who refuse to have sex with the same cow twice. She takes off on this and decides it's worth writing about, but is it really true? Or is she just compensating for her own personal feelings of unworthiness? Judd's character will come off as a dipstick to some because the emphasis on her character is that of someone who deals with the sadness of breakups in a very self-destructive way. Some have called her character idiotic and offensive; I just thought that the fact she reminded me of myself making the same mistakes in the same situation made it hard to watch her without wincing (which is probably why it would be easier to call her idiotic and offensive). What I also find odd is how director Tony Goldwyn seems to want to suppress his characters' quirkiness; coming from the guy who directed A Walk on the Moon, a film that was about people who stuck out from the enforced norms of their times, this seems rather a cop-out way of telling a film's story. Other than that, the film's ending is too much-too soon, but throughout the bulk of its running time Someone Like You is a free-flowing film with much to recommend it.

I liked it for its high spirits even as its characters are depressed; I liked it for its ability to make me laugh a sufficient amount of the running time so that my attention to it was undiminished; I particularly enjoyed the fact that it doesn't attempt to be anything more or less than a sunny little romance movie, which makes its charm even more appealing.
The film is definitely a woman's movie, to be sure. It stars Ashley Judd as talk show scout Jane Goodale, who becomes enraptured with feelings of undying love for hunky new producer Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear). She learns that he has a girlfriend, but that doesn't stop him from inviting her out on walks, spending time with her, and finally getting romantically involved with her. Just as they are about to move in together, after six weeks of dating, he dumps her, unable to handle the stress of dumping his old girlfriend.
This sends Jane into a frenzy, who turns to the world of animal husbandry to find a reason for why her relationships never work out. Her comments become an instant success among women, though her identity is kept a secret. In effect, her comments about the behavior of the male species are her way of constructing a defense mechanism against coping with the rejection she has faced.
Not everyone agrees with her on her points, most notably her new roommate, Eddie (Hugh Jackman), who brings new meaning to the word ""womanizer."" Or at least that's how it appears on the outside; as Eddie and Jane get to know one another better, they unknowingly begin to help one another out. Jane soon learns that her defense strategy won't help her out in the long run, while Eddie realizes that there is something true to being in a relationship, if you find the right person.
There's nothing new to the plot or the material; we've seen it all before. People meeting, getting together, breaking up and blaming the entire opposite gender... anyone recall such films as ""One Fine Day"" and ""What Women Want?"" None of this would work if it weren't for the adept use of humor and refreshment to keep us going with the story. Elizabeth Chandler's script isn't original, but it's not boring, either, and gives old tactics a fresh feel.
This is all made possible by the charming and spunky performances from the cast, featuring some very quirky work from Ashley Judd, who spends much of the movie running around in a frenzy. Her smile could brighten up any movie, and she brings a lot of warmth and charm to her role. She also shares an ever-present chemistry with lead actors Greg Kinnear and Hugh Jackman; Kinnear plays his role just as it needs to be: like a sap. Jackman is the ideal ""slut,"" and his sparring sessions with Judd provide some very comical laughter. Not only that, but you believe in the sparks between them as well.
In a long line of mature comedies that take on the battle of the sexes, ""Someone Like You"" comes up a winner. It has spontaneity and wit, is full of charm and breezy laughter, and in the end, even if all you had left were the actors and their ability to keep us entertained by their characters' grief and shenanigans, this would still be a very refreshing hit.",1001462400,,3611,4.582689335394127
1619469,4,B00005K3OI,"This is the first movie I've seen Ashley Judd do comedy in & I thought she did a fantastic job.  Judd plays Jane Goodale, the producer of a talk show, who gets dumped by Ray (Greg Kinnear).  In her time of relationship mourning she develops The New Cow Theory which explains that like cows, men grow tired of women after they ""get"" them & move on to a ""new cow.""  Based on Laura Zigman's book, Animal Husbandry, the screen adaptation was cutely done. Ashley Judd & Hugh Jackman have great on-screen chemistry and Greg Kinnear does a great job of playing an annoying ex-boyfriend. If you're looking for a light, romantic-comedy this movie is perfect for you.  It's simple entertainment, with some cute male-female concepts.  As long as you don't take it too seriously & appreciate it for what it is, I think you'll like it.  From a person who enjoys watching cutesy romantic comedies, over & over again-I know I will.",1001376000,7,916,4.6234567901234565

I thought with the stars in the movie, it might not be the usual dumb, predictable romantic comedy.  I was right, it was worse.  I'll stick to the latest TV shows with good writing, by for example - the Palladinos who wrote The Gilmore Girls.  Or other new Amazon offerings. Other quality options are made by the BBC, not American romcoms.",1515110400,,466,4.191011235955056

7942796,2,B00005K3OI,"The script is terrible. It portrays a woman who does not use her brain at all when it comes to relationships, while the whole point is that she's actually coming up with a theory about the subject. She resolutely sets herself up for failure, even at the end. She repeatedly gets emotionally abused and it's hard to empathize with her unless we turn our 14 year-old brain back on. Hugh Jackman's character seems to be a sucker for torture too. The only saving grace is the sheer amount life, energy and charm that both leads inject into their roles. Perhaps 14 year-old minds (regardless of actual age) could gain a good lesson from this movie, but the script definitely focused on showing people what not to do. A little more balance and maturity would have helped a lot.",1506470400,,771,4.594202898550725

I wish there was more time with the couple that ended up together though. I think this is a movie that men might not admit they like but might admit they can relate to. Will watch again and definitely recommend!,1504310400,,348,4.688524590163935
