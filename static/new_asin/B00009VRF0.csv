1891940,5,B00009VRF0,"The first two seasons of the long-awaited ""Ottoman Collection"" are now here as part of Image Entertainment's release.  You will not be disappointed with the quality and content of these discs.
Look for seasons 3-5 next year and keep checking for info on the ""Ottoman Collection "" release.  As the son of Sam Denoff, one of the writers and producers of The Dick Van Dyke Show, I've always wanted the DVD on DVD release to be of the highest quality.
The Dick Van Dyke Show was a big part of everyone's childhood, and in a very special way an even more important part of mine.
We hope that the color special, ""Dick Van Dyke and the Other Woman"" also makes it out on DVD soon. It was Mary Tyler Moore's fine performances in this special that clinched the deal for CBS to offer her her own well-deserved series.",1059004800,26,806,4.4391891891891895
1891941,5,B00009VRF0,"The Dick Van Dyke show was the finest television series I have ever seen. I loved it in first run when I was a boy and have been watching it in syndication for 4 decades. I still remember some of the scenes cut for syndication, I can't wait to see them again.
Most everyone knows the set up of the show so I won't go into it. However what people may have forgotten is the depth and quality of the scripts. Even the most lighthearted episodes are rich in the values everyone says they want to instill in thier children yet we rarely see in modern television. The character development over the run of the series is tremendous. The ensemble starts strong and gets consistantly better. Sprinkle in the occasional song and dance number and some well placed slapstick humor and you've got a first rate T.V. show.
I am thrilled to see this great show being released on DVD.
Order your copy now, you will never regret it!",1058313600,8,914,4.414201183431953
1891942,5,B00009VRF0,"I can tell all of you that this collection is well worth the wait.
The episodes were transferred from the original CBS network prints and are the full episodes as they were originally shown (no cuts as they currently air in syndication).
The bonus footage is outstanding and includes Emmy Awards footage, cast interviews, and new commentary by Carl Reiner and Dick Van Dyke and other members of the cast, and much, much more.
To top it off, the actual packaging is slick and includes a different lenticular on the front of each season (the release of the remaining seasons is planned to occurs approximately each quarter of a year).  The first season shows Rob tripping over the ottoman!
Fans - you will NOT be disappointed.  Here's to a BIG thumbs up!",1055980800,,752,4.6893939393939394
1891943,5,B00009VRF0,"I'm so glad this is coming out on DVD!  I have all the episodes taped off of Nickelodeon but they are not in order and they have commercials.  I also started buying them on tape from Columbia House but after six tapes, they didn't have any more!  Even though I've memorized every episode and know exactly what's coming next, I still laugh my head off at these great classics.  I guess I'm a true ""Dick"" fanatic!",1055289600,3,411,4.368421052631579
1891944,4,B00009VRF0,"It's about time!  After so many years of mediocre shows coming to DVD, a real classic is released.  The first season of The Dick Van Dyke Show contains many favorite episodes.  Lets hope this is the start of all the seasons being released!",1054771200,9,239,4.511627906976744
1891945,5,B00009VRF0,"There's nothing better or more impressive than a great, old, sitcom that still cracks you up, no matter how old you are. This sitcom makes me laugh *very* hard, and i'm 13. all the slapstick can be enjoyed by the younger group of children while the wittiness, quick timing, and sacarsam will appeal to an older audience. here are the great episodes from the first season.
 Ratings:
**** - One of the very best
*** - Good
** - Not so good
* - Unworthy of association with the rest of the series
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SICK BOY AND THE SITTER (1) - The first episode ever. Laura worries about leaving Ritchie with a babysitter when she thinks he's sick. *** (NOTE: Mary Tyler Moore's real-life son was named Ritchie.)
THE MEERSHATZ PIPE (2) - Rob gets jealous when Buddy seems to be getting preferential treatment from Alan Brady. ***
JEALOUSY (3) - Laura doubts Rob's faithfulness when a beautiful guest star appears on the show. ***
SALLY AND THE LAB TECHNICIAN (4) - Sally ruins a date with Laura's cousin when she can't stop wisecracking. ***
WASHINGTON VS. THE BUNNY (5) - Rob agonizes over having to miss Ritchie's school play. ****
OH, HOW WE MET ON THE NIGHT THAT WE DANCED (6) - Rob and Laura explain to Ritchie how they met. *** (NOTE: In this episode, Laura's maiden name is Meeker, which was the last name of Mary Tyler Moore's first husband. In Episodes 59, 87, 131 and 156, it's Meehan. Rob also says he doesn't smoke, but in several other episodes, he is clearly seen with a cigarette.)
THE UNWELCOME HOUSE GUEST (7) - Rob takes care of Buddy's dog for the weekend. ***
HARRISON B. HARDING OF CAMP CROWDER, MO (8) - An old army buddy of Rob's shows up, but Rob doesn't remember him. ***
MY BLONDE-HAIRED BRUNETTE (9) - Laura bleaches her hair when she thinks Rob has lost interest in her. ***
FORTY-FOUR TICKETS (10) - Rob forgets that he promised the PTA tickets for the Alan Brady show. ***

EMPRESS CARLOTTA'S NECKLACE (13) - Laura pretends to love the hideous necklace that Rob bought for her. *** (This one only makes sense if you assume that Rob has absolutely NO taste. Also note that Rob's parents are played by a different actor and actress than usual, and that Rob's father's name is Edward instead of Sam.)
BUDDY, CAN YOU SPARE A JOB? (14) - Buddy asks to be released from his contract so he can take a higher-paying job. *** (NOTE: Sally clearly states that Mel married Alan's sister! In Episodes 146 and 153, it's the other way around.)
WHO OWES WHO WHAT? (15) - Rob isn't sure whether Buddy paid back the money he borrowed. ***
SOL AND THE SPONSOR (16) - Rob's army buddy Sol Pomeroy invites himself to dinner the night that Rob is entertaining his stuffy sponsor. *** (NOTE: Interesting casting here... The sponsor's wife is played by the actress who sometimes plays Rob's mother, and Sol PomerOY is played by Marty Ingels, whereas in certain other episodes, the character's name is Sol PomerANTZ and is played by Allan Melvin.)
THE CURIOUS THING ABOUT WOMEN (17) - Rob gets mad at Laura for opening his mail. ****
PUNCH THY NEIGHBOR (18) - Jerry goes too far when he needles Rob about the Alan Brady Show. *** (NOTE: Rob says that Alan Brady's wife's name is Barb. In Episode 153, Mel says that her name is Margaret.)
WHERE DID I COME FROM? (19) - Rob tells Ritchie the story of the day he was born. ***
THE BOARDER INCIDENT (20) - Buddy stays at Rob's house while Pickles is out of town. ***
A WORD A DAY (21) - Ritchie starts using naughty words. ***
THE TALENTED NEIGHBORHOOD (22) - Rob ends up auditioning every kid in town when the Alan Brady Show announces a talent contest. ***
FATHER OF THE WEEK (23) - Ritchie doesn't want Rob to talk to his class at school. *** (NOTE: Ritchie's teacher is played by the actress who often appears as Rob's mother.)
THE TWIZZLE (24) - Sally discovers a new dance craze. **
ONE ANGRY MAN (25) - Rob is called for jury duty, and he's the only one who thinks the defendant is innocent. ***
WHERE YOU BEEN, FASBINDER? (26) - An old high school classmate of Sally's shows up, and she misinterprets the reason for his visit. *** (NOTE: Pickles Sorrell shows up again.)
THE BAD OLD DAYS (27) - Rob begins to think that Laura has robbed him of his masculinity. ***
I AM MY BROTHER'S KEEPER (28) - Rob's brother Stacey comes to visit, with a bizarre secret. *** (NOTE: In Episode 11, Rob tells Sally that his brother is married. In this episode, Rob tells Sally that Stacey is engaged. In Episode 111, Stacey announces he is about to BECOME engaged. Also, Stacey says that he remembers Laura from the wedding, but considering the circumstances under which Rob and Laura got married, it's highly unlikely that Stacey was present.)
THE SLEEPING BROTHER (29) - Stacey performs for Alan Brady at Rob's house. **** (NOTE: It is stated that Mel married Alan's sister. In Episodes 146 and 153, it's the other way around.)
THE RETURN OF HAPPY SPANGLER (30) - Rob gives his old mentor a comedy writing job. ***",1054512000,79,5368,4.620942408376964

I love checking out the sixties dcor and clothes, and I love never knowing what's going to come out of Sally Roger's mouth next...or Buddy Sorrell's, or anyone's for that matter! I also love Carl Reiner in the part of the temperamental Alan Brady. Pure genius.

I love all the extras and interviews that are included in this package: it is a wonderful treat and a great pleasure to listen to the interviews of the actors and actresses reminiscing and telling stories of their time together. This company also did a fantastic job restoring these great classics: the picture and sound are wonderfully clear.

My one caution for the youngers is to help them understand that the way Buddy always cuts-down Mel is stage humor and should not be duplicated in real life.

I love that we can see these classic shows for free on Amazon Prime and the content is great for the whole family.  Not only that, the writers and the actors were genuinely funny with plots about everyday life (enhanced)!  A few of our favorite episodes were: #13--Empress Carlotta's Necklace (Who hasn't received a gaudy or horrible gift that left you speechless?), #14 Buddy, Can You Spare a Job? and #19--Where Did I Come From?

1892061,5,B00009VRF0,"I've always loved this show!  In fact, my wife and I have yet to grow tired of watching the same episodes over and over again - still laughing even though we know what's coming ...  especially the time Laura opens the package sent to Rob and a huge self-inflatable raft bursts out of the box.  Just one curiosity though, in the earlier episodes Rob would go back and forth calling her ""Lori"" sometimes and ""Laura"" other times.",1396915200,,426,4.5064935064935066

1892064,5,B00009VRF0,"This is one of the top five sitcoms of the 20th Century.  Endlessly funny, its writing was superb and its casting was brilliant.  The genius of Dick Van Dyke, the humor of Morey and Anne Marie, the wonderful Richard Deacon and Carl Reiner characters, Jerry Paris and Ann Morgan Guilbert, the always-lurking Frank Adamo, the old-timers like Johnny Silver, Herb Vigran, Isabel Randolph, Herbie Faye really made this show.  And no one could have done Laura Petrie better than the beautiful, smart and likeable Mary Tyler Moore, she sparkled and made us want to hug our wives a little closer.  She is an American treasure.  The show never grows old.  You can watch the episodes over and over and laugh anew.",1396137600,,703,4.768595041322314
1892065,3,B00009VRF0,"Love this show .. .. remember it as a child. Got Season 3 for xmas and recently added Season 1 and 2 to my collection. While good, Season 1 is my least fav. season so far.. The characters of Rob and Laura are still trying to find themselves. .. Buddy and Sally and Mel are great.. Jerry and Millie downright annoying at times. It  has a sort of Father knows best 1950's flavor to it.. where Rob is the boss and Laura does as told ... In some of these episodes she's called Laurie instead of Laura ...and I don't care for Rob's he-man patronizing tone which is lost in later seasons.... I don't care for the storyline starring Rob's brother and the Twizzle episode is downright annoying. Still it's great fun and there's some really enjoyable episodes. the one where they watch Buddy's dog, the one where Laura opens Rob's mail and he gets mad, and  a few others. I would like to add Season 4 and 5 to my collection as well.",1396137600,,923,4.2988505747126435
1892066,5,B00009VRF0,I was too young to see this show first time around but always enjoyed the reruns.  I've just watched the first two episodes: the sets are minimal and there's some expository dialogue just in case you can't figure out that Rob is the head writer and Mel is the producer.  The energy and humor are fantastic -- Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie are like fireworks!  Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore have great chemistry together.  They do much of their dialogue in an embrace.  I don't know if contemporary sitcoms show as much sincere (and almost chaste) love between spouses as the Dick Van Dyke show did.  I love it.,1396051200,,616,4.504504504504505

1892075,4,B00009VRF0,"A half century after it's debut, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" continues to make me laugh out loud! This Kennedy-era sitcom , once considered ground-breaking in part because housewife Laura Petrie (Mary Tyler Moore) was shown regularly wearing more than casual dresses, also reflects the socially-accepted roles of men and women back in that day. Mooe importantly, however, the humor still rings true, even if some of the presumptive attitudes now are considered dated (Rob's man-hungry co-writer/sidekick Sally, Rob as ""lord and master"" of his New Rochelle home, the easily frightened Laura, etc.). The physical comedy scenes at times are reminiscent of ""I Love Lucy,"" and the singing and dancing scenes peppered through the episodes are top notch. Unlike today's sitcoms, the humor here is family-friendly as well. Highly recommended.",1392854400,,831,5.4

They were masters of comedic timing. Their characters had an ""everyman"" quality about them, which kept the show grounded because the rest of the ensemble's characters were a bit over the top.

As a second benefit, you can see a totally different America. Watch it and discover how much we're changed for the worse in a relatively short time.

1892148,5,B00009VRF0,"The Dick Van Dyke Show Season 1 or any season is a classic. It is a sophisticated sitcom with superb actors and even more outstanding writing and directing primarily by John Rich and Jerry Paris, also a member of the cast. The cast is probably one of the first in a class of casts now referred to as an ""ensemble"" cast. While there may be a lead or start, if you will, the rest of the cast play very vital roles in the success of the show. This is one of those shows. Dick Van Dyke, one of the most physically adept actors of all time, was the star. However, seasoned veterans Rose Marie and Maury Amsterdam, and newcomer Mary Tyler Moore, a future lead in her own successful show, round out the star talent. Also providing memorable support are Jerry Paris (also one of the series' directors), Ann Morgan Guilbert, Richard Deacon, and the series creator Carl Reiner, as Alan Brady, the fictional star of a variety show for which Van Dyke, Marie and Amsterdam are writers. The life of a television writer makes for some very funny comedy story lines. I watch the show often, and I never get tired of it. I have the entire series as a part of my DVD collection.",1375574400,,1160,4.375

1892153,5,B00009VRF0,"It is totally amazing that after 50 years this show, its writing and the cast of this show is just as good today as it was back then. I read somewhere the only reason the show did not go on longer was because of the common belief that TV shows should not go on longer than 5 years, otherwise I think it would have made it 10 years?

One thing I found interesting about the first season was the inclusion of the pilot of the show as it was totally different from how the show was actually done. The pilot was a disappointment if you have seen how the show actually turned out?

In any formate, this show is a classic and well worth watch over and over.

Oh, I found it also interesting that shows back then were on some 30-33 weeks per year and today have gotten down to as little as 10 weeks per year. Something is broken that needs to be fixed? By the way I also found it humorous to see that shows like this used to sell laundry soap on the show itself?

1892192,5,B00009VRF0,"Talk about ""must see"" television! This is brilliant stuff, mostly written by Carl Reiner, brilliantly executed by a perfect cast. Van Dyke's physical humor is peerless, the movements suggesting a comical version of Astaire, seeming to defy gravity with their weightless shuffle. His facial expressions seem that of a dancer as well, and Mary Tyler Moore is always perfect in her subtle ""straight man"" reactions which Van Dyke can play off over and over. Besides that, she is consistently gorgeous, both physically and spiritually, the epitome of the ""girl next store"" beauty of the era, with her lack of overt sexuality making her all the sexier in a constant parade of tasteful outfits which show off her dancer's physique without ""showing off."" As is not uncommon in shows of the era (and perhaps others), her Laura offers Rob a certain wifely grounding, a kind of womanly wisdom, which his boyish character often needs to get through the plots; yet the show often offers Rob the chance to reciprocate, making their marriage all the richer. The scenes in the writers' room, with the peerless interplay among Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, Van Dyke and Richard Deacon (as producer Mel), give Reiner and company the chance to concoct an endless series of side-splitting one-liners, which the cast executes with Groucho-inspired perfection. Why am I writing this? This show is beyond the need for reviews. Just watch it.",1362355200,,1417,5.05982905982906

1892204,5,B00009VRF0,"Oh, the 1960's. That was the era of silly stuff. Not that I don't own and adore Green Acres, I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched, and Get Smart. But The Dick Van Dyke Show definitely stood out in that decade as a show full of class, sophistication, and maturity, and made me a fan of Dick Van Dyke for all time. In fact, if it were not in black and white (which is the only sad thing, as the other four I mentioned are all in color), you might not realize the show is that old. Well... you might get another clue of its age from the lack of bad words or dirty jokes. If there is any proof that you can actually entertain an audience with intelligent humor - and we are still laughing 50 years later - The Dick Van Dyke Show is it.

I'm not even sure what else to say! There are too many great episodes for me to try to pick a favorite. The Walnut one of course. The one where they stay in the haunted cabin. And the one where Rob goes off to work on his novel and Dick Van Dyke carries almost the entire episode himself as a monologue. What talent! This show led me to Diagnosis Murder in 1993, and to collecting all of Dick Van Dyke's movies. All of them I can get my hands on, anyway. (They should really work on that. Some were never even released on VHS.) Dick Van Dyke fan forever!!!

Naturally, I totally recommend Seasons 2-5 as well. I observed on here how consistently all the seasons have top ratings, 4.8 or above, no poor ratings to bring them down! That never happens with other shows that have lasted many seasons. That is really saying something, especially for a show so old.",1334188800,,1585,4.176470588235294
1892205,5,B00009VRF0,This is such an essential classic to own.  The humor and talent are just as fresh today as they were over 40 years ago.  The extras are fun and with interesting trivia.  I highly recommend this DVD set.,1326412800,,202,4.2631578947368425
1892206,5,B00009VRF0,"After re-watching a dozen episodes from The Dick Van Dyke Show, I changed my mind and decided that I should, after all, write an Amazon review for the series. Not because I think too many people will see my review, which will undoubtedly be hidden beneath multiple pages of previously-posted reviews. Not because I think Amazon readers need any more recommendations to get this set after reading the scores of such recommendations already present. Not even because it would be fun to reminisce as I wrote the review about everything I liked about the show over the years. No, I decided to write this review because, after re-watching these classic episodes again, I realized afresh that The Dick Van Dyke Show is one of the best, perhaps THE best, comedy series I've ever seen, and if even a single person watches this show for the first time because of this review, the effort would be entirely justified.

There are lots of funny TV shows, but I can't think of any that have affected me like The Dick Van Dyke Show has. My childhood is filled with the memories of watching the show with my father as I grew up. We sat there together, laughing out loud, over and over again, day after day, and felt like we were special guests to be asked into Rob and Laura Petrie's family each week. But were these childhood memories just a figment of my passing childhood, laughs that would disappear with time and a new social context? Not one bit. As I watch these shows in sparkling, crystal-clear DVD format (the ""DVD"" being no relation to ""Dick Van Dyke""!), I find myself laughing - and enjoying - these episodes as if I never saw them before. And even when I have the jokes and the sequences memorized - and for many of them, I do - I can find no other reaction other than to laugh out loud as I did when I was kid. This is a downright, flat-out funny, witty, enjoyable, and entertaining program.

Can comedy be funny without resort to off-color language? Can shtick and physical humour actually be supremely hilarious? Can an element of sophistication be woven into comedy so that the audience can laugh at itself without being insulted? Can timeless themes be woven into stories that actually entertain? One needs watch only a handful of Dick Van Dyke Show episodes easily to quickly affirm each of these questions. And perhaps more impressively, its easily apparent that the cast and crew pull this off silky ease, belaying the true work that was put into the show. There's no question about it: the writing, the plot lines, the acting, and the personal charm of those involved in The Dick Van Show set a standard apart from others, a standard that sees no wear from the ravages of time. It doesn't matter that we are watching black-and-white in a clearly post-1950's suburban home and work setting: we see color and modernity even as we look right through these unimportant backdrops. The themes and talent that pours out of nearly every episode is unaffected by time, setting, and costume.

I once heard Carl Reiner say that Dick Van Dyke was the most talented entertainer he had ever known. It's hard to disagree with him once we've seen the show. Van Dyke is like Rowan Atkinson, but in spades, and with an inner charm that endears the watcher. He can sing, he can dance, he can tell jokes with precision timing, he can use understatement as a weapon, and he can make us totally sympathetic to his plights without appearing whiny. Rob Petrie, but more importantly, Dick Van Dyke, strikes us as an intensely decent person imbued with a joy of life that pervades everything he does. Actually, we are CONVINCED he is an intensely decent person, and we are just there for the ride as we watch him move through life with all its comic ups and downs. He could have never done it without Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, and Mary Tyler Moore (not to mention all the others who worked on the show before the camera), but Van Dyke stands out as that supremely gifted individual, a talent amongst a group of talents, Holland's gift to America. That so many gifted individuals could work together without stepping on each other's toes is a miracle in itself. It's an assemblage of people rarely seen, and I fear, not to be seen again for a long time.

Season One gets off to a rocky start. In retrospect, we can see the show is trying to figure out itself, trying to understand how all the pieces work together, trying to determine how stories are to be assembled for best impact. The show was slated for cancellation twice that year, and only after Sheldon Leonard stepped in to rescue it - and a change of time slot for Season Two right after the successful Beverly Hillbillies - did the show take off.

But in Season Two, the show takes off like no rocket you've ever seen before. Season One has some strong episodes and great plot ideas, but it's Season Two that sees the cast working in a seamless, slick, and sophisticated manner that turns the show into a timeless classic. It's almost as if everyone involved realized they were given a second chance, and with that, the gloves came off, the worries were put aside, and everyone just got ""into the groove."" The show knocked out one outstanding episode after another, and by the time Season Five occurred, everyone knew that this might likely be the highlight of their careers. The show was ended at the height of it's popularity because of Reiner's insistence - he said he did not want to show to die slowly, but go out while at the top of form - and we can only wonder what a ""Season Six"" might have held for us. But it's no matter. These are comedic masterpieces at the top of form, a goal for others to try and match, and a standard by which all others are measured.

If you've never seen The Dick Van Dyke Show and wonder what it is about, I'll tell you. It's about a somewhat charmed life of a regular group of people who are talented, happy, and good natured and who face the normal problems, irritation, and strange events that are a part of nearly everyone's life. That's all you need to know. Start with Season Two and work forward from there. When you are done, go back to Season One and see how they figured it all out in those early months. But by then, you'll already be won over by the many wonderful episodes, and will doubtless be re-watching these over and over again. Millions of people of have done so over the years. To watch these episodes is to easily understand why.",1326153600,,6431,4.539655172413793

Shows of this era that kids would like are ""The Partridge Family"" at 5-stars and ""Leave It To Beaver"" at 5-stars; the first two seasons of ""Leave It To Beaver"" are the best, then its hit and miss with an occasional brilliant episode.

It all seems so quaint to see a pre-Betty Friedan marriage, or a child who respects his parents, or Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke having two glasses of milk on their bed table before they go to sleep. By the time I became cognizant of the world, it looked more like what I was seeing on All in the Family. In fact, the Van Dyke show gave me such a nostalgic longing for the past that it even somewhat dampened by enjoyment of the show itself, I'm sorry to say.

1892230,5,B00009VRF0,"In the Fall of 1961, CBS first aired The Dick Van Dyke Show, one of funniest sitcoms in television history. Similar to I Love Lucy, but featuring more docile and less eccentric characters, the show became a mainstay in the top 10 Nielsen ratings for its first four seasons. When the show's ratings slipped in the fifth season, the network cancelled the show. But in the four decades since, The Dick Van Dyke Show has continued to entertain its fans and their children (and their children's children) via syndicated re-runs...

The Dick Van Dyke Show is centered around the life of Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke), a family man living in suburban New York. As the head writer for the fictional ""Alan Brady Show,"" he works with co-writers Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam) and Sally Rogers (Rose Marie). Rob's work life is always interesting given Buddy's constant wisecracks, Sally's never-ending search for a husband, and the trio's unified harassment of Alan Brady's brother-in-law, Mel Cooley (Richard Deacon). At home, Rob's loving yet overly-nervous wife Laura (Mary Tyler Moore) stays at home with the couple's son Ritchie (Larry Mathews). Surrounded by all these unique characters, Rob is always embroiled in someone's scheme, fantasy, or shenanigan...

The Dick Van Dyke Show (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""The Sick Boy and the Sitter"" in which Rob convinces Laura to go to a party at Alan Brady's house, despite the fact that their five-year-old son Ritchie is sick. The two get a babysitter, but Laura's maternal instincts don't disappear... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Jealousy"" in which Laura grows jealous of Rob's work relationship with a beautiful TV star, and ""Where Did I Come From?"" in which Ritchie asks Laura and Rob about his origins, and they struggle to come up with the right answer...

1892231,5,B00009VRF0,"The writing and comedy of these episodes puts modern television to shame and it's good clean fun to boot.  Unfortunately, all of the discs in the set I bought suffered video distortion throughout - must have been bad ""pressing.""  However, Amazon made returning the discs and get a new set painless and prompt.  I will get the new set only three days after I received the first and before they receive the returned set through an easy process.  However, the show was so great that I ""watched"" two episodes even though all I got was the sound.",1111190400,5,541,4.546391752577319
1892232,5,B00009VRF0,"I just played this set, and all I can say about it is-WOW!!! The audio and video are both exellent, as are all the extras. Cast and crew interviews, the ""Cheers"" spots with Dick that orriginally aired during the show, an original CBS ad for the show (one show even has Dick opening it by saying ""Hi. This is Dick Van Dyke. Welcome to our show."") Also, it has the original pilot that Carl Reiner wrote and starred in!

AND, the episodes themselves are uncut!! Ther's scenes in them that I either never saw in sydnication or since the series first aired. For instance, in one episode (""Washington vs. the bunny"") I was surprised to see TWO ENTIRE SCENES that I had never seen before. And, two or three episodes air with a ""cold start"", which is how they were first shown. For those who never saw them, and are planning to buy this set (which I HIGHLY reccomend!) I won't spoil it by telling you which ones.

A SPECTACULAR set, and I urge everyone to buy it!",1110931200,6,955,4.359550561797753
1892233,5,B00009VRF0,"Dick Van Dyke's season one box-set is absolutley wonderful.  The extra's are few BUT, it doesn't matter because he doesn't need extras at all.  The commercials are a fun extra, which when included in an episode seem even better.

  I do have to say that I'm certainly glad that this show turned into what we know as Dick Van Dyke's Show because that original pilot, boy....Wheeww[...]  That wouldn't have lasted long.

  I can't think of a cast where I have thoroughly enjoyed EVERY single cast member as much as I do this show, but it's true, there's not a stinker in the bunch.  Buy this set and relive the classic memories or just discover this show for the first time, which I did, and I guarantee you'll be hooked too!",1093132800,7,723,4.492307692307692
1892234,3,B00009VRF0,"Tried two different copys so far, but in both, 3rd-5th pisodes on disks 3-5 suffered from varying degress of skipping, distortion, etc (episode 5 on disk 4 would not play at all, instead skipping to the beginning of the DVD). This is not at all related to the priginal quality of the episodes themselves (since it severity and location of the problems vary in different sets) but with a sloppy production process.

The episodes themselves are very good, and this would receive a 5 star rating where it not for the skipping and other problems",1093046400,10,541,4.6947368421052635
1892235,4,B00009VRF0,"Okay, if the distortion were related to the transfer process, then it would be distorted exactly the same way every time, on every DVD player. The distortion that has really annoyed me is entirely digital and related to the DVD itself. On Disk #4 (Season 5), starting with ""A Long Night's Journey Into Day,"" I could barely even view the episode for all the digital distortion. Also, the picture would freeze in a broken up mosaic -- sometimes the audio continued, sometimes not. Eventually the picture just blanked out altogether. I tried playing the DVD on another machine and had a little better success -- the distortions cleared up a bit. This is how I know it's related to the DVD and not the transfer process.

 So, I let the DVD player cool off. I cleaned the lens and the DVD carefully, and tried again. This time a little better. In fact, I got through ""Journey"" and the following episode with only a few glitches. But I still could not view ""A Day in the Life of Alan Brady"" at all.

 Every other DVD has been very good. A few artifacts that are clearly transfer related, but I can deal with those. But Disk #4 is very bad. I have asked Image Entertainment for a replacement but have heard nothing so far. (UPDATE: I heard from them only a short while after writing this review and they replaced Disk #4 at no charge. They have corrected the problem.)

 Otherwise, they have done an outstanding and terrific job of restoring these episodes and I can't thank them enough.",1090454400,6,1480,4.52434456928839
1892236,5,B00009VRF0,"The Dick Van Dyke Show is simply a landmark of television situation comedy. It's treatment of the American family bought the sitcom into the 1960's. Where I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best were relics of the staid, conservative Eisenhower years, The Dick Van Dyke Show propelled sitcoms into the New Frontier. Audiences now got to see a family that more closely mirrored the situations and concerns of their own lives (even with the inevitable exaggeration of situations that occurs in event the best shows). For the first time, audiences not only got to see where the father figure in a family worked, but that workplace became a focal point for many of the show's episodes. Fathers and mothers were real people and not the carboard cutouts of Father Knows Best and Ozzie and Harriet or the hysterical cartoon characters of I Love Lucy. A Jewish character was vital, not as a caricature as in previous shows, but as a real, viable character. To be sure, there was the usual lunacy found in most sitcoms, but the humor arose from situations that its audience could identify with and relate to.
However, no innovation introduced by The Dick Van Dyke Show was more important than the modernization of the portrayals of women on television. Mary Tyler Moore's Laura Petrie isn't the pretty, but sexless perfect housewife of the 1950's. She is a sexy, intelligent partner to Dick Van Dyke's Rob Petrie who is nobody's fool and is Rob's moral conscience in many ways -- unheard of in the 1950's. As Van Dyke said during a retrospective on the show, ""You knew that even though Rob and Laura slept in twin beds, they were doing something else besides sleeping in that bedroom."" Moore's tight capri pants and curvaceous figure inspired lust among men (including Carl Reiner's son Rob, who once touched Moore's rear end on the set) that was unimaginable just a few years earlier.
But even more importantly, a female character was now a vital part of the humor of a show without being a sarcastic parnter like Alice Kramden, a sterile, smiling mannequin like Donna Stone/June Cleaver/Margaret Anderson/et al or a wild maniac like Lucy Ricardo. What makes this first season DVD set so important is that the viewer can track when the show hits its stride. And, not coincidentally, it hits that stride when the show starts to utilize Mary Tyler Moore's great comedic talents in the 9th episode, ""My Blonde Haired Brunette.""
In the first eight episodes of the show, all of the characters, not just Laura Petrie's, seem unfinished. However, each character has their identity defined to a great extent (Rob is the father figure who sometimes is given to clumsiness, Buddy Sorrell is the wisecracking veteran writer, Sally Rodgers is the man hungry female writer who uses her sense of humor to hide her loneliness, Mel Cooley is the fussy producer who is the butt of Buddy's jokes, etc.) The character of Laura, however, seems to be a more modern version of the 1950's housewife, there to give support, cook breakfast for her family, etc.
In ""My Blonde Haired Brunette,"" all that changes. Rob plucks a gray hair out of Laura's head and kids her that she's getting old. Laura becomes extremely insecure and wonders if Rob is still attracted to her. Encouraged by next door neighbor Mille Helper, Laura dyes her hair blonde for Rob. However, when Rob tells her over the phone that she would look like Harpo Marx if she were blonde, Laura panics and tries to dye her hair back to its natural brunette color, ending up with a head of hair that is half blonde and half brunette. When Rob sees her, Laura starts to cry uncontrollably in what would become a running joke in both the Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore show (Moore is the best comic crier in entertainment history). Carl Reiner has said that that was when he knew how special Moore was and, from then on, Laura was an integral character in the show's humor, equal to every other character on the show. The humor doesn't arise from stupid, wacked out antics like on earlier sitcoms, but instead from feelings that everyone has had and can relate to: fear of aging, fear of being unattractive to your spouse, etc. ""My Blonde Haired Brunette"" is one of the most important moments in television history: the emergence of a more modern, realistic woman and the real debut of Mary Tyler Moore as a comedienne who can inspire laughter by showing her humanity rather than playing the fool.
(NOTE: If you want to see how integral Moore, Van Dyke, and all the rest of the cast was to the success of The Dick Van Dyke Show, be sure to see the pilot for the show called ""Head of the Family"" which starred Carl Reiner as Rob and Barbara Britton as Laura. The episode is so unfunny that it makes the audience appreciate Van Dyke and Moore's talents that much more.)",1083110400,42,4834,4.694935217903415
1892237,5,B00009VRF0,"I my mind, this is the greatest television sitcom of all time.  Dick Van Dyke set the standard by which all sitcoms should be measured.  Combine the flawless writing with an ensemble cast that has never been equaled, and the stage is set for an enduring classic.
Unlike other shows from the '50s and '60s, the Dick Van Dyke Show has worn well over time.  It doesn't come across as quaint or corny - 40 years later, it's still flat-out FUNNY.
This DVD release is outstanding, the quality is first rate.  This will be a treasured part of my collection for years to come.
Watch even a few episodes, and you can clearly see that ""they don't make 'em like they used to.""",1080864000,5,665,4.382113821138211
1892238,5,B00009VRF0,"I own the first three seasons and plan to acquire all five sets. The producers spared no expense with slick retro packaging and art, lots of extras, and beautifully sharp black & white picture quality.  The humor holds up well and best of all, it can be enjoyed by my entire family.  In fact, my precocious two year old loves the show!  When I was younger, I liked the office-related episodes most of all, but now that I have a family, I appreciate the domestic humor even more -- and the chemistry between Dick, Mary and their son Ritchie is terrific.  The show works on many levels - as a sophisticated sitcom, satire on television, slapstick comedy, as well as family sitcom. Highly recommended family viewing!",1077580800,2,713,4.634920634920635
1892239,5,B00009VRF0,"I loved this set!  I remember watching the Dick Van Dyke show as a kid and laughing so hard my stomach would hurt.  I wondered how funny it would be to me now and I was happy to find that these episodes were just as funny to me now as they were back then.  My 7 year old and 5 year old watched them with me and they were laughing also.  Dick Van Dyke was such a great comedian, his timing is perfect and his physical comedy is brilliant.  Mary Tyler Moore was the perfect comedic partner, she's just as brilliant in her own understated way.
Maybe it's partly due to the fear and uncertainty after 9/11, or maybe it's just because I'm older now...but this world seems very bleak at times.  There seems to be so much hatred, fear, uncertainty out there.  It was very calming to me to watch a show that was full of good clean fun.  Back in a time when families still ate dinner together, when neighbors actually knew each other and had dinner parties at each others houses, when children treated their parents/adults with respect and had no idea what ""drugs"" meant.  Each episode was a nice pleasant escape.  I ended up feeling a little more optimistic about the future after watching a few episodes.
I'm going to order Season II.  I'm sure these episodes will be just as funny.",1073347200,4,1275,4.360169491525424
1892240,5,B00009VRF0,"If you like The Dick Van Dyke Show, you simply must get this set. First, the show itself is very funny, well-produced and brilliantly written. All the cast memebers are just perfect for their respective roles, and it's easy to see why this has become one of the all-time classics of television.

Now about the DVDs: First of all, the video quality of this set is excellent. The film masters have obviously been extremely well preserved over the years, and the final results are unbelieveably sharp, with glorious black-and-white tonal range. So sharp you can actually see film grain and the textures of fabrics in clothing and furniture. These transfers are at a whole different level than the blurry, unsteady transfers seen on TV over the years. These unedited shows run over 25 minutes instead of the 22-minute versions seen in reruns. It's also nice to not have any annoying annoucer voice-overs or the even-more-annoying split screen credits often seen on TV. There are insightful interviews with cast and creators of the show, as well as some really nice and varied bonuses like Emmy Award footage, original promo spots, and other nice little surprises, some of which have never been seen before, or haven't been seen since 1961. The menus are stylish and retro, and the whole package is well designed and well executed.

In short, if you love quality TV, do not hesitate to buy this DVD set. I've already ordered season 2 and am looking forward to more seasons coming out. I hope that this series will succed on DVD and we'll see more worthwhile TV classics of this caliber released, like the remaining seasons of the Mary Tyler Moore Show and the Bob Newhart Show.",1072396800,6,1672,4.802083333333333

The Dick Van Dyke Show is one of TV's best ever.  Funny, well-acted, just absurd enough to seem like real people.  And, in spite of their obvious bedroom arrangement, Rob & Laura are still the sexiest couple in TV history.
I can't wait to get Season Two--and I hope both sell well enough for them to release the other seasons.  I also hope this encorages someone to release complete seasons of ""The Andy Griffith Show"".",1069804800,3,733,4.447761194029851

This show centers around Rob Petrie (a comedy writer who works for the Alan Brady Show), his wife Laura, son Ritchie and co-workers Buddy and Sally.  They each have their own style and they each have a way of getting themselves into crazy and hilarious situations.
This show seems to fit with the classic greatness of I Love Lucy and Andy Griffith.  It is sincerely funny.  There is no violence or profanity.  If you've never seen this show, watch it.  If you have seen it, just relax and take yourself back to the time when television was worth watching.",1069200000,,761,4.6
1892244,5,B00009VRF0,"Kudos to Image for thier great work on The Dick Van Dyke show season one.
From the cute packaging with an old TV holding a removable lenticular motion card from the show to the wonderful transfers, it's terrific (not perfect, but terrific).
The most important thing is, of course, the shows themselves. The shows sport new transfers and are fantastic. There is an episode here and there that has a bit of print damage and there is also an episode here and there that has some ""flutter"" (I don't know how else to explain it). That means that in small segments of a couple episodes, the picture is alternataly sharper and less sharp. But these are minor transient details that don't take away from the overall beautiful look of these shows on DVD.
Just compare an episode on these DVD's to a broadcast of the show on TVLand and the difference is night and day. Compared to the DVD, it seems you are looking at the show on TVLand through Vaseline coated glasses. On DVD you can see so much clothing texture, you can read the names on the board on the outside of the Alan Brady show writer's office. It's a pleasure looking at the show looking this good.
Since Image opted to keep the shows on a dual layered DVD to 6 or 7 (most studios would do 8) there are no distracting compression problems I can find. That's great because compression shows up much more on Black and White material (where your eyes are drawn to texture and details that color hides more).
Yes, the shows are unedited. I was surprised to find though that on TVLand, there editing of the shows is not too much. They achieve the shorter running time by ""time compression"" and in the end they cut about 2 minutes instead of the usual 3 or 4.
The extras on this set are not all that much but still interesting. Most of the interview materials comes from a 1994 TV special. I was hoping for more recent interviews with the surviving stars but this stuff was still good. There are also vintage promos and cast commercials (sometimes put in with an episode) and clips of the show winning emmy awards.
All in all, a highly reccomended set for fans of this great show.",1068681600,4,2126,4.453846153846154
1892245,5,B00009VRF0,"These terrific DVDs are enhanced by vintage clips -- promos and commercials with the stars; a half-hour cast guest spot on ""Stump the Stars""; Carl Reiner and company gleefully receiving some of their 15 Emmys. Hidden features show the cast selling cigarettes for Kent, a loyal sponsor.
 Stars of the time such as Joey Bishop, Lucille Ball, Sebastian Cabot, Bob Crane and Jane Wyatt pop up, making the sets delightful time capsules.
Dick Van Dyke and Reiner do leisurely commentaries on a handful of key episodes, spending a lot of time on what happened to the cast and crew -- especially who is ""still with us,"" and who is not. They swap a few great stories, and have vivid memories of making the episodes. ""Stan Laurel should have sued me,"" Van Dyke says as he watches himself do a bit. ""If only life could be so simple,"" Reiner sighs as one plot unfolds.
Co-star Rose Marie, ex-child actor Larry Mathews and ""neighbor"" Ann Morgan Guilbert chat over a few other shows. In one case, Rose Marie plows ahead with a hilarious story long after the episode has ended.
While the audio commentaries are new, other recollections come via footage from what must have been a terrific 1994 TV special about the show. Executive producer Sheldon Leonard and ""human joke machine"" Morey Amsterdam, both of whom have since passed away, have their say in these clips.
Images and sound are surprisingly good. The restored video has decent contrasts over a pleasing gray scale, with minor wear surfacing here and there. The look falls comfortably between flat and silvery. The 2.0 mono ably conveys dialog, canned laughter and Earle Hagan's bouncy theme music.
The first DVD set includes ""Head of the Family,"" Reiner's flat, almost surreal 1960 pilot for the show, in which he played the lead against a different cast. No network was buying. ""The reason Carl Reiner's show failed was Carl Reiner,"" hot-handed producer Leonard recalled in 1994.

1892249,5,B00009VRF0,"Image Entertainment's October 21st, 2003, DVD-Video release of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show Season One"" is a superior example of TV-on-DVD. Just about as close to ""perfect"" as you could get, in my opinion.

The Dick Van Dyke Show, which ran for five seasons on CBS-TV from 1961-1966, seems as fresh, funny, and (above all) REAL today as it did all those years ago, when it barely was able to survive its rocky, low-rated first season.

This glorious 5-Disc set contains each of the 30 first-season programs. We also get the exceptionally-nice bonus of the series' original pilot, ""Head Of The Family"", created by resident series genius Carl Reiner, which starred Reiner himself as Rob Petrie, along with a completely different group of actors portraying the show's other characters. The CBS pilot was telecast in July 1960, which was its only network airing.

Every facet of this DVD set is a treasure of gold. Everything! Starting with the classy packaging, with the outer slipcase representing a facsimile of an old-fashioned B&W TV (right down to the simulated ""vent holes"" on the back).

The ""TV"" image shown on the front of the slipcase has Rob Petrie falling over the living-room ottoman, taken from the opening credits of the show (not the first-year credits however, which don't have the ""ottoman"" opening sequence).

The front-of-the-box picture (which is actually a removable insert card which can be slid in and out of the mock ""TV screen"") will yield a ""motion picture"" effect when tilted from side to side, or up and down. If you move the picture just right, you'll see this nice 3D-like effect, with Rob starting out in a standing position, and then proceeding to fall over the ottoman. Very cool!

The five discs are housed in separate ""ThinPak"" DVD cases, which each has a different picture on the front. These cover art images are excellent, and can be looked upon to represent a mini ""Photo Gallery"" in and of themselves. There are also some additional still photos on the back (and on the inside) of each slim plastic case, along with complete episode information for that particular disc, including episode numbers, film dates, original air dates, and a short synopsis for each program. Chapter stops are also included.

A small 4-page printed insert also comes in this package. This mini-booklet provides some informative general information and ""Did You Know?"" fun facts concerning The Dick Van Dyke Show and its cast.

Apart from the programs themselves, the large amount of effort utilized in creating just this first-rate packaging is readily apparent.

Each single-sided disc has either six or seven full-length, unedited episodes. Each program has a running time of just a tad more than 25 minutes, including the beginning and ending credits. So we know they're the full programs, without any scenes cut out, which is excellent indeed. For marathon lovers, there is a ""Play All Episodes"" feature, for uninterrupted continuous viewing of that disc's programs.

VIDEO .... The picture quality is excellent on these DVDs. Considering the considerable age of these programs, I think it's safe to say, due to the intense and very lengthy restoration and remastering process that was undertaken here, that these episodes have never looked any better.

The black-and-white photography is very sharp and clear, bringing out some details you probably never knew were even there while watching these episodes originally in the 1960s on the smaller 19-inch monitors of the era.

A few of these Season-One episodes do suffer from some slight ""fluttering"" (for lack of a better term). That is to say, some portions of a few episodes have a bit of a ""blurred"" look to them in some scenes (particularly noticeable in the ""wider"" shots, as opposed to the close-ups, which aren't marked by the curious ""flutter"").

This slight imperfection in video quality (which affects just a few random episodes) isn't enough of a distraction, however, to reduce the enjoyment of any of these first-year Van Dyke programs (IMHO). And I'm guessing that this ""flutter""/""blur"" problem that exists on some of the episodes probably won't even be noticed by viewers who watch these DVDs on a smaller TV screen. On a larger screen, you might notice more irregularities and anomalies.

AUDIO .... There's a very adequate Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtrack employed for each episode. This original mono sound does very nicely. All dialogue is easily heard and understood. No subtitles are included.

EXTRAS .... An amazing wealth of bonus material has been assembled for this boxed set (as well as its Season-Two sister set, which actually contains even more bonus stuff than this volume). Dick Van Dyke and Carl Reiner provide commentary tracks for two episodes (""Where Did I Come From?"" and ""The Sleeping Brother"").

Other bonuses include -- Retrospective interviews and featurettes with the cast and crew, Emmy Awards clips (which are great fun to see, transporting us back to the 1960s with the click of a remote button), photo galleries for many of the episodes, network promos, and some original commercial spots. It's a fabulous amount of added-value content for a TV program from the early 1960s.

In addition, there's a small extra feature on selected discs called ""Ottoman Tripper"", which, when selected, reveals a single trivia question about the Van Dyke Show, with 4 possible answers. Selecting the correct answer will reveal a snippet of the opening credits of the show in which Rob Petrie sidesteps the ottoman upon entering the living room. If an incorrect choice is selected, you get a clip of Rob tripping over the ottoman, with added ""crashing"" sound effects. A cute little bonus, again emphasizing the devotion and care the creators of these DVDs have taken in producing this product.

Rounding out the extras, there's a ""Meet The Cast"" feature (which is text only), with some brief bio-style information about the show's cast members.

MENUS .... The menu structure is simple and easy to navigate. Each episode has its own separate Sub-Menu, which features chapter selections and a few ""screen captures"" for that episode. Highlighting the icon marked ""Extras"" takes you to all the special features that are specific to that episode. A ""Special Features"" option can also be accessed from the disc's Main Menu as well.

-------------------------------------------

Coming up next is a complete Episode List for Season One of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", which consists of 30 programs, all of which are showcased in this picture-perfect, five-disc DVD boxed set. (And don't forget about that bonus 31st program in this collection -- that being the original Van Dyke pilot.)

This episode list reflects the order in which the programs are presented within this DVD collection, arranged in sequence by ""Production Date"" (the date of filming the show), which does not always necessarily match the ""Air Date"" chronology.

I've also included the original CBS-TV air dates, plus selected episode descriptions for some of my favorite first-season shows, and some funny quotes from some of the programs as well......

-------------------------------------------

""HEAD OF THE FAMILY"" (PILOT) --- Starring Carl Reiner in the role of Rob Petrie. Featuring Barbara Britton as Laura, Morty Gunty as Buddy Sorrell, and Sylvia Miles as Sally Rogers.

The ""Pilot"" episode ultimately evolved, more than a year later, into what would become ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"". ""Head Of The Family"" was filmed in early December of 1958, but it didn't receive its one and only network TV airing until more than a year-and-a-half later, when CBS aired it on Tuesday, July 19, 1960.

-------------------------------------------

THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW -- SEASON #1 (1961-1962):

1. The Sick Boy And The Sitter (First Aired: 10/3/1961) .... The premiere episode of the series does a fine job of introducing America to Rob and Laura Petrie (and company). Young son Ritchie is a little under the weather, and Laura senses that something bad is about to happen at home when she reluctantly agrees to attend a party with Rob at Alan Brady's house.

The assorted talents of Dick Van Dyke, Morey Amsterdam, and Rose Marie are put on display during the ""party"" scene at Alan's house. Mary Tyler Moore's considerable dancing and comedic talents, however, aren't fully realized in this debut show; but those MTM traits shine through nicely in the episodes soon to follow.

Ritchie Petrie (played by 5-year-old Larry Mathews) is given numerous funny lines in this pilot program, and he's never cuter than in this first episode of the series. .... ""Do I feel hungry, mommy?"" :)

2. The Meerschatz Pipe (11/28/1961) .... Rob is the one who gets sick in episode #2, with his ego and pride taking a beating when he feels he's not needed down at the office. .... ""I sound this way because my wife thinks I've got a cold.""

3. Jealousy! (11/7/1961) .... A first-rate episode, highlighting Laura's insecurities when Rob has to work late at the office with a beautiful female, ""Valerie Blake"", who is guest-starring on ""The Alan Brady Show"". .... ""You've been very busy blakely!""

4. Sally And The Lab Technician (10/17/1961) .... ""I can't remember when I laughed that much. I found myself laughing out loud -- right out loud!""

5. Washington vs. The Bunny (10/24/1961)

6. Oh How We Met The Night That We Danced (10/31/1961) .... A great flashback episode, the first of many such ""Go Back In Time"" eps., detailing how Rob and Laura first met while Rob was in the Army. .... ""Oh, she's noticed you alright; she just hasn't liked what she's noticed.""

7. The Unwelcome House Guest (11/21/1961)

8. Harrison B. Harding Of Camp Crowder, Mo. (11/6/1961) .... One of my all-time favorite episodes. When Harrison B. Harding drops by for a visit, Rob can't seem to remember who this guy is. To his later embarrassment, Rob calls the police on Mr. Harding after deciding Harrison might be some kind of shady character. .... ""Give me a napkin, quick! -- Tomato juice in my ear.""

Just after the hilarious ""tomato juice in my ear"" portion of this episode, watch carefully as Rob ever-so-gently places the glass back onto the exact same part of the wall where he had it previously. (It must have left a 'ring', and Rob didn't want to create a second such ring. LOL!)

9. My Blonde-Haired Brunette (10/10/1961) .... This extremely-funny Van Dyke entry has Laura deciding to dye her hair blonde in order to spice up her marriage. But she soon regrets that decision. .... ""I told you, I never dyed before!"" .... ""And the GRAY HAIR!!"" :)

10. Forty-Four Tickets (12/5/1961) .... Rob's faulty memory causes him some problems in this episode (44 problems to be precise). Watch for Rob's/Dick's outstanding (and seemingly-effortless) head-over-heels pratfall at the very beginning of this show.

11. To Tell Or Not To Tell (11/14/1961)

12. Sally Is A Girl (12/19/1961)

13. Empress Carlotta's Necklace (12/12/1961) .... This episode is a favorite of mine. It features just about everything that makes this TV series so fabulous and timeless and charming -- e.g., great ""natural"" humor brought out by life's ordinary occurrences, plus the genuinely-heartfelt tenderness and love that exists between the two main characters (Rob and Laura Petrie). We can really feel Laura's sincerity in the scene where she apologizes to Rob for having suggested giving the necklace to Rob's mom.

This episode gets five full stars (and then some). Future ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" co-star Gavin MacLeod puts in a very funny performance here as Mel Cooley's jewelry-selling cousin, ""Maxwell"", who (like Mel) is bald as a cue ball.

""You see, Maxwell doesn't have any overhead."" --> ""Kind of runs in the family, don't it?"" .... ""It looks like a chandelier!"" .... ""You'd better take that mirror away before she floods the living room."" .... ""Shoehorn!"" :)

14. Buddy, Can You Spare A Job? (12/26/1961)

15. Who Owes Who What? (1/24/1962) .... ""Here's three dollars -- I owe you seventeen.""

16. Sol And The Sponsor (4/11/1962) .... ""You're both named Henry? That's crazy!""

17. The Curious Thing About Women (1/10/1962) .... A classic. A first-class script, a curious female named Laura, and lots of very funny moments. .... ""Honey, did a package come for me?"" :-)

18. Punch Thy Neighbor (1/17/1962) .... Another fave, with Jerry Paris (as neighbor Jerry Helper) playing a major role here. Frank Adamo, frequently seen in small bit parts throughout the series, pops up again in this episode. He plays the ""Singing-Telegram Messenger"", and he gets to read (sing) a very funny rhyming message sent to Rob by the wisecracking Jerry. ....

""Robert Petrie wrote a show,
Supposed to be funny, ho-ho-ho;
Look how far this man has gotten,
Writing shows that are really rotten!""

~LOL!~

19. Where Did I Come From? (1/3/1962) .... Another top-notch flashback entry in the series. Rob's physical humor is the standout here. The ""Perfectly-Placed Hat On The Bedboard"" scene is always worthy of a big laugh, no matter how many times you've seen it. .... ""Oh, I really need my pants today, Rob; I'm having lunch with the sponsor.""

20. The Boarder Incident (2/14/1962)

21. A Word A Day (2/7/1962)

22. The Talented Neighborhood (1/31/1962) .... Will Rob survive the agony of the annual ""Most Talented Child"" contest? .... Watch for character actor Ken Lynch in a highly-unusual role for him -- incredibly, he's NOT playing a policeman.

23. Father Of The Week (2/21/1962)

24. The Twizzle (2/28/1962)

25. One Angry Man (3/7/1962) .... Funny ""lone juror holdout"" episode. Rob, naturally, is the only juror voting ""not guilty"". The scenes in the courtroom highlight this show. .... ""What's the matter with the way I ogled her?""

26. Where You Been, Fassbinder? (3/14/1962)

27. The Bad Old Days (4/4/1962)

28. I Am My Brother's Keeper (3/21/1962) **

29. The Sleeping Brother (3/28/1962) **

30. The Return Of Happy Spangler (4/18/1962) .... Season One concludes with more first-rate physical humor from Dick Van Dyke. Rob's lecture about the art of comedy is the highlight here. In lesser-talented hands, this ""lecture"" would not have been nearly as funny. But Dick has that magic ""something"" that can turn a scene that might otherwise be ""ordinary"" into pure comic gold.

** = Two-Part Episode

-------------------------------------------

How about some intriguing ""Dick Van Dyke Show Season 1"" Trivia & Miscellany? OK, here's some for you:

>> Many people have labeled Rob & Laura Petrie as ""America's First Couple of  TV"", likening the attractive and photogenic TV husband-and-wife duo to that of the real-life ""First Couple"" of the day, John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. In addition to this purely sentimental and cosmetic ""connection"" made between the two couples, there are also two other very interesting pieces of information that closely tie the Kennedys to the fictional Petrie clan. .....

Many fans of the show might not realize that both of these ""First Couples"" made their debuts on the exact same date. On Friday, January 20, 1961, JFK was inaugurated as the nation's 35th President; while later that very same day, the premiere episode of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (""The Sick Boy And The Sitter"") was filmed in Hollywood. (The show wouldn't be aired, however, until more than eight months later.)

>> Another Kennedy/Van Dyke Show tie-in occurred in 1958, when actor Peter Lawford, JFK's brother-in-law, forked over the cash to finance the filming of Carl Reiner's pilot, ""Head Of The Family"". With another interesting Kennedy twist being the fact that in order for the project to go forward, it appears that the Kennedy patriarch himself, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., had to personally green-light Carl Reiner's script with a positive review of the material.

The elder Kennedy evidently did indeed give a thumbs-up to the pilot script, because just days after reading it, Lawford issued the funds to support its production. So, I suppose one could argue that if it weren't for the backing of the Kennedy clan, we might not have ever seen ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" make it into production. (Although, even without the aid of the powerful Kennedy family's financial assistance, it's doubtful whether the writing talents of Mr. Reiner would have remained hidden from public view for very long.)

>> Each first-season episode of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" cost about $40,000 to produce. That figure is practically pocket change by today's TV production-cost standards, with many of today's television shows costing millions of dollars per episode to produce.

>> The original January 1961 Desilu Studios Production Schedule listed the premiere episode of the Van Dyke series as ""Carl Reiner Show: All In A Day's Work--Pilot"", a title that was never used. The official title of the show had not yet been finalized at the time of the first show's filming.

>> This Season-One DVD treasure chest contains one of the very best Mary Tyler Moore/Laura Petrie ""crying jags"" of the whole series -- in the episode ""My Blonde-Haired Brunette"", which features a nifty-looking half-blonde/half-brunette Laura Petrie. That was the episode which solidified the comedic acting talents of Mary Tyler Moore in the eyes of Carl Reiner (and everybody else who worked on the show). It didn't take Mary very long to go from ""That Girl With Three Names"" (just before she was cast in the part, when nobody could remember what her name was) to an acting force to be reckoned with. The rest, as they say, is history. :)

Long live ""The Dick Van Dyke Show""! .... And now it now WILL live on and prosper, thanks to Image Entertainment's beautifully-done season-by-season DVD compilations.",1066867200,9,17704,5.030448169688676
1892250,5,B00009VRF0,"I just bought this set (along with Season 2) and can't say enough good things about it.  First, when Image says the episodes are ""restored"" -- they mean it!  Picture and sound quality are excellent.  Next, these are the FULL-LENGTH episodes, completely unedited.  The first episode I played had a scene in the middle of the show that I'd never seen before (not on TV Land, not on Nick at Nite, not in local syndication).  Running time of each episode is at least 25 minutes & 30 seconds -- wow.  Another episode I played even had the original network footage at the beginning, with Dick Van Dyke saying, ""Welcome to our new time slot.""  Amazing.  Then there are the bonus features -- audio commentaries (interesting ones!) and new interviews and original TV commercials and Emmy Awards footage and more.  Finally, the packaging is very sleek and looks great.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.  Do ALL ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" fans a favor and buy it so that Image will release Seasons 3 through 5.",1066780800,99,994,4.590909090909091

A brilliant idea which was brilliantly executed. The casting was as brilliant as the idea - a current star (Van Dyke), the as yet undiscovered future star (Moore), and the non-TV industry stars (Amsterdam et al).
