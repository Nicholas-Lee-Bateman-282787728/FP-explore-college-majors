8739725,5,B017M2EJPA,"I love everything about this workout DVD. I love the quick workouts, which is a must for a busy work at home mom, and I love how motivating Keridon is throughout the workouts. The shipping was supper quick and the value for the price is excellent!!",1451779200,,248,4.413043478260869
8739726,5,B017M2EJPA,Only had this for a few weeks but I can already tell you that I love it!! Keridon has both beginner's and advance levels and even modified ones for those who are just now getting into exercising. I've tried others but this is one I'll stick too.  The sessions are 30 minutes or less and I can do them at home.  With my hectic life it is nice to find a program that fits my schedule.,1448582400,,382,4.0131578947368425
8739727,5,B017M2EJPA,"Yours truly is a 59 year old male who has not worked out(for the most part) in many many years. I hate to admit how many. Yeah. I just completed the 25 day program and I must say it was an incredible journey! So much so that I will be starting it over soon.  So what's it about? It is a 2 DVD set with programs designed for both beginner and advanced. It is progressive and includes days of rest along the way(I really liked these a lot...lol).  Keridon provides just the right amount of suggestions such as reminding you to breath(I was continually holding my breath in the beginning) and lets you tailor your workout to yourself. She has assistants who do modified versions which I used quite frequently.

Folks, I do not have the greatest coordination, flexibility, balance or stamina but I was able to make it through these by following the suggestions and not giving up. I didn't give up.  If you are getting up there in years like me, this is for you. If you are young, this is for you. Again there are both beginner and advanced programs and one can easily mold the program to themselves. The key is not stopping. Is this a great value for a 2DVD set?  Yes!",1448409600,,1164,4.345622119815668
8739728,5,B017M2EJPA,"Keridon's Fat Krusher is an amazing program! Keridon did a great job designing these 25-Day programs with the BUSY PERSON in mind. I'm a mom of five and can't find time to go to the gym. Keridon's super affordable DVD series is a great replacement for the cost of a gym membership AND the time it takes to go to the gym! This is just like bringing a personal trainer home to you - on your schedule!!! Beginner or advanced, this program is for YOU! Love love love!!!",1446681600,2,465,4.295454545454546
