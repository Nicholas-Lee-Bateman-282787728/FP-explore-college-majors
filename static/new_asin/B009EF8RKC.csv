8540569,5,B009EF8RKC,"This is the second time my husband and I purchased this DVD - this time as a gift for someone else that we were working with in class.  The step by step pace is well done, alternate views are helpful and the advantage of replay and slow motion is a good learning tool.  Recommended for a student with some martial arts background, would caution for a complete beginner because some of the elements of the technique are just there rather than explained in detail.",1397865600,4,462,4.488095238095238
8540570,3,B009EF8RKC,This material would be more understandable if they used weapons of different color and wore clothes that would show more contrast. The information was beginner level and I didn't understand why they keep trying to make difficult moves work. If the move was that hard to practice then it would be impossible to make them work on a person that is struggling.,1392422400,5,356,4.758064516129032
8540571,5,B009EF8RKC,I got this video as part of a set bought directly from DFA.  I only recently (last two weeks) got to check it out and it is a lot of information in an hour long video.  The locks are clearly displayed and he does a voice over that explains the details quite well.  Each lock is shown multiple times which makes it easier to learn from the DVD.,1365984000,,343,4.014705882352941
