4887809,5,B005SYZZ80,Kim Novak is a blast playing a double role in The Legend Of Lylah Clare. You 'll laugh when she cusses out Coral Browne ! A gritty story of Hollywood that probably tells more truth than you would think about tinseltown.,1346198400,,219,4.365853658536586
4887810,5,B005SYZZ80,"I love this film for all of the wrong reasons. The best way to describe it is ""pure camp.""  This movie is touted on cable channels as a ""guilty pleasure,"" and that it is.  I may be wrong, but I doubt anyone involved with the making of this 1968 film had any idea of the mess they were making.  It is supposed to be a thriller that goes nowhere, but that does not matter.  I have such a good time watching Kim Novak in that stiff wig they saddled her with that I kind of feel sorry for her.  I'm glad she redeemed herself in most of her other movies.  If you appreciate camp, this is one to rent.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-Of-Lylah-Clare/dp/B007Z9QK0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend Of Lylah Clare</a>",1343779200,3,767,5.0476190476190474
4887811,4,B005SYZZ80,"Omg....what a great camp classic. People have said this is Kim Novak's worst performance, (it's actually her last leading role in a feature), but I think people are taking the movie too seriously. It' been said the studio upon viewing the movie for the first time, didn't know how to take it, then decided to sell it as camp. There is no doubt in my mind that this movie was made from the start with that in mind. Maybe some of the actors involved didn't know it at the time of shooting, but that's the brilliance of it. Kim had to be in on the joke though, her performance is high camp style at it's best. When she does her wicked laugh, it is f'ing laugh out loud hilarious.
Lylah Clare (Kim Novak) is a dead film star. Movie-producer Barney Sheean (Ernest Borgnine) hires Elsa Brinkmann (Kim Novak), the living image of the late Lylah, to star in a film based on Ms. Clare's life. Barney hires director Lewis Zarkan (Peter Finch), Lylah's former husband, to transform the talentless Elsa into a facsimile of the deceased screen queen.
This color print from Warner Archive is really crisp, and bright.
There is a drinking game to be made from this movie, I just haven't figured it out yet.
Really fun, campy movie about Hollywood, but please, watch it with tongue firmly plated in cheek.",1329955200,7,1289,4.536480686695279
4887812,3,B005SYZZ80,"This movie is bad, so bad its actually fun buts its probably only entertaining for Kim Novak fans.  If it had been made properly without dubbing Ms Novak when she is channeling Lylah it could have been a really good film.  Great plot.",1326585600,2,234,4.4186046511627906
4887813,5,B005SYZZ80,"Warner Archive has once again done it.  They have released a more than 40 year old film with a stunningly beautiful remastered DVD edition that has not looked as good in rich Metrocolor since I saw it in a New York City theater upon initial release in 1968.  I still have never seen the original TV play by Robert Thom and Edward de Blasio that starred Tuesday Weld.  Was it the same Robert Thom who wrote ""Wild in the Streets"" and other AIP hits?  The theatrical film stars Kim Novak, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine, Coral Browne, Milton Seltzer and Rosella Falk and was directed by Robert Aldrich who brought us ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"", ""The Killing of Sister George"" but also ""The Dirty Dozen.""  His films are heavy-handed, sometimes brilliant and always entertaining.  As scripted by Hugo Butler and Jean Rouverol with music by Frank de Vol and photographed by Joseph Biroc, ""The Legend of Lylah Clare"" is no exception.  It is a campy, somewhat melodramatic and cynical examination of tinseltown.  Warner Archive should be congratulated once again for bringing this overlooked film to home video, bringing their increasing finesse to the technology and becoming even more affordable.  Includes a trailer.  There are a few imperfections, but again this film is over 40 years old with otherwise bravura restoration.",1321056000,14,1357,5.044843049327354
4887814,4,B005SYZZ80,"Fans have been waiting years for ""The Legend of Lylah Clare"" to arrive on DVD. Warner Archive finally comes through with a beautifully restored, widescreen release (Sorry, NO Subtitles) of this overlooked 1968 indictment of Hollywood and the people who make the movies and make or break the stars. (NOTE: Check the Images section of this product for the screen grabs I posted). Directed by grand-guignol master Robert Aldrich (""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"", ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte""), the film tries for the same gothic atmosphere, but doesn't quite achieve it, with it's psychadelic colors, fuzz guitars on the soundtrack and lightning-fast dialogue not as well-suited to the genre.

Kim Novak plays a dual role as mousy but headstrong budding actress Elsa Campbell, who is plucked from obscurity by agent Milton Selzer and presented to has-been director Peter Finch because she resembles the dead 1940s movie queen of the title. At first Finch is reluctant to meet her, but quickly changes his mind when Elsa begins to eerily channel Lylah while viewing her old films. It becomes clear that Finch and Selzer will direct and produce a new biopic about the late star. It's never explained or acknowledged in the script whether Elsa's supposed to be possessed by Lylah's spirit, but the script moves things along quickly, we as the audience don't really question it either.

Predictably, Finch becomes increasingly obsessed with molding Elsa into Lylah's image to recreate the past. The film's highlight is a press conference in which Elsa is introduced and there are clever camera angles used so that we the viewer don't get to see Novak's transformation until she descends the imposing staircase where the original Lylah met her demise years ago. According to her acting coach and supposed one-time lesbian lover Rosella Falk, she was accosted by a crazed fan on her wedding night and died under mysterious circumstances. The history of that fateful night is recalled Rashomon-style, in three separate, creepy, distorted, black-and-white flashbacks, while Novak's visage is superimposed in the corner listening wide-eyed to the sordid details.

Coral Browne steals the show as a viper-ish, crippled gossip columnist who pokes and prods Novak with her cane like a piece of livestock, referring to the starlet as ""a grubby little slut"". The film's best moment comes when Novak channels Lylah and lets Browne have it with both barrels. The deep, guttural German voice-dubbing for Novak as Lylah is so over-the-top it's ridiculous, and gives the movie added camp appeal. There's also some witty dialogue such as ""For a man who sticks his initials on everything including the toilet seat, you're pretty critical of other people's vanities"". Odd little moments such as Novak strolling the grounds of Finch's mansion in polka-dot hip huggers and her brassiere also give this a bizarre flavour.

Ernest Borgnine is terrific as the blustery studio head barking orders at everyone, and a brunette Ellen Corby (""Grandma Walton"") has a small part as ""Script Girl"".

Some may find this movie endlessly talky and dull, and it probably could have benefit from some tighter editing as it does run over two hours. Not as campy or fun as ""Valley of the Dolls"" but better than ""The Killing of Sister George"".

You may want to check the Warner Archive site because the price is much less, but for Canadian and International customers, they don't ship outside the U.S.",1319932800,19,3454,5.104424778761062

4887820,5,B005SYZZ80,"While this is a true camp classic that elicits many perhaps unintentional guffaws, Kim Novak's great beauty is lavishly depicted throughout.  It might be best viewed with the sound off.  The last ten minutes have to be seen to be believed.  Beneath the buffoonery and absurdity, a real sense of cynicism and bitterness emerges.  Well worth a look.",1412380800,,347,4.931034482758621
4887821,5,B005SYZZ80,"Here's the movie that's so campy it makes Showgirls look like straightforward drama. Everything about Lylah Clare is awful and immensely entertaining. Kim Novak's performance is absurd - there's no other word for it. Going from zero to zany in six seconds flat, Novak embodies the ghost of Lylah, who apparently was a muppet show-style parody of Marlene Deitrich (only with a variable Swedish/Italian accent dubbed over by a horrendous voice actor!). The flashbacks of Lylah's demise are cause for laughter, with bizarre distorted audio, trippy psychedelic visual effects,and Ms. Novak's dim-witted, gaping gob planted in the corner, vaguely staring into space.

The plotting is ridiculous - Lylah was a popular actress who died young, her doppelgnger shows up to take her place and is seemingly possessed by Lylah to such a degree that they wind up dying more or less the same way. But don't even get me started on how delightfully over the top and bizarre the doppelgnger's death scene is. It's enough to make you laugh so hard you might vomit. The sad clowns! Oh dear.

Anyway, Lylah's husband (Peter Finch, playing the role so catty and flamboyant that it makes his actually-gay character from Sunday Bloody Sunday look straight by comparison) is a faded film director who decides to make a comeback by hiring the lookalike, Elsa, to star in a movie detailing Lylah's life story. Only problem is that Lylah was so imperfect that the story of the film is almost fictional. Wouldn't want to mention the lesbianism, the drugs, etc. after all. Conveniently, since Lylah and Finch were married, that means that the movie we are watching gets to repurpose the obvious soundstage set of their house as a soundstage set within the film itself (just set up a light rig in the corner and we can say we're ont he backlot now!). It also gives them an excuse to show us the soundstage they're filming on and the crew working there and claim it's all for the movie within the movie. In reality, it's just the cheapest thing you've ever seen done.

The whole thing inexorably snowballs into a larger and larger disaster as the acting gets hammier, the directing gets weirder, and the script gets shredded amidst Ms. Novak's Tazmanian-devil style scene chewing. This is one of the dirt worst movies to ever come out of Hollywood, but it's also a true gem for anyone of the MST3K persuasion. Bring your friends over, put this on, and let the jokes fly!",1412121600,,2439,4.816229116945108

Less arguably are the talents of Robert Aldrich, the director. These two together, plus other talented cast members, provided me with an 'edge-of-my-seat' story of what goes on behind the scenes in 1960's Hollywood. Whether movies, television or the Kardashian family, there is LOTS of drama behind the scenes! I enjoy the behind-the-scenes stories (on today's DVDs and the ""scandal rags"") as much as the productions themselves ... and sometimes, moreso! This movie provides both; since it is an entertaining MOVIE about what goes on BEHIND THE SCENES. So, I got two for the price of one.
