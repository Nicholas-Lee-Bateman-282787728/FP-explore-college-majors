74117,3,0784011249,"Caught up is a good movie, not Great but good, I liked Woodbine's performance, And could care less if snoop made a cameo or not or whoever else. I thought it was good.",1258416000,2,167,4.090909090909091
74118,1,0784011249,"I could say that Im surprised about the positive reviews for this movie but Ive been browsing through Amazon since late 2005 so I have come to grips with people giving bad movies good ratings. Caught Up is bad..really, really bad. It looks like it was done by amateur and with the exception of competent cinematography everything else about it blows.

The story: Darryl Allen(Bokeem Woodbine) is having the worst luck ever. He loses his moronic friend to a high speed chase accident. He meets a mysterious woman named Vanessa Dietrich(Cynda Williams) who gets him in the middle of a scandal involving pilfered diamonds from a Jamaican mobster. He is forced to work for a fruity and shady limousine owner named Wild Bill. He befriends one of the guys at this job who ends up being an undercover cop named Frank Lewdon(Clifton Powell)posing as some unfortunate bum named Herbert. On top of all that he keeps getting shot at by somebody(who I will reveal later in this review).

You know a movie is in trouble when the cameo appearances by Snoop Dogg and LL Cool J are the best thing about it. You know a movie is in trouble when a sex scene involving Cynda and Bokeem is better than the rest of the movie. The acting is awful. Bokeem Woodbine was great in Jason's Lyric, Panther, Strapped, Gridlock'd etc but he stinks here. Its not his fault. The script is a terrible one that causes for him to profusely overact at every scene. The only scene he fared well in was the scene where he talks to his son over the phone. Bokeem's performance elsewhere in this movie was hammy.  Now, I love Clifton Powell but he gives the worst performance of his acting career as the unscrupulous undercover Frank Lewdon. The interrogation scene where he spits back in Daryl Allen's face and slaps him around is laughable to a fault. Having Cynda Williams play both Trish and Vanessa made the movie all the more confusing. As a matter of fact that is the biggest flaw of Caught Up: its confusing as hell from start to finish. The film gets hysterically bad and worse as it progresses. It has plot holes big enough to fit the state of Texas in. Let me give you two examples of the huge holes in this story: Vanessa murders Trish and puts her dead body next to Darryl in a motel. Question: How does she know where Trish stays? Plot hole #2: Darryl is constantly getting shot at and in the end it turns out to be the same cop his friend shot in the groin earlier in the movie. Question: how does this wacky cop know where to find Darryl at? These are the few examples of the many plot holes in Caught Up. A movie so bizarre that it makes you wonder if the director and writer was sloshed while he wrote this tripe. There is a reason why Darin Scott fell off the map after this movie. Caught Up is confusing, jumble mess of a movie that adds to the negative stigma attached to low budget movies. Some low budget movies can be good but this movie is not one of the exceptions. Stick with the soundtrack. Its more satisfying than this stinker.",1228089600,,3016,4.450271247739602

74120,5,0784011249,"It was basically a decent movie. The plots keep flipping on you. The first part is silly, but what can you say about the 'hood'? That acid on the head was a bit much though. And they never let us know how the fortune teller finds him. She had to know about him. Glad to see that he was able to finally open his club and get his son.",1125964800,,332,3.8260869565217392

74124,5,0784011249,"It is truly amazing how someone can be 'Caught Up' in someone else's  stupidity and  Woodine should have realized that after getting out of  prison.

74135,5,0784011249,"This movie is funny as hell! I don't think it's meant to be a comedy, but it has a lot of funny parts. A lot of excitement and whodunit intrigue too. I'm telling you, Bokeem is a bug out in this movie! You'll love him! This is especially good to watch when you're feeling a little down in the dumps or bored.

74136,5,0784011249,"I rediscovered this movie on NETFLIX recently.......and IMMEDIATELY went to Amazon to find it. Lucky me. ""Caught Up"" practically redefines the word OBSCURE......no major ""Starpower"" to carry the film whatsoever that would give it any chance of popular recognition. Guess what? No ""Starpower"" really needed to make an enjoyable film. I think you might be thoroughly entertained by this one folks......give it a chance......thank me later.",1397779200,3,437,5.636363636363637
74137,4,0784011249,"I was expecting it to be an insipid movie  like Soul Plane but it wasn't , the movie was actually good. It had alot of twist and turns to the story line, it nice boobies to see, it had Jamaicans with real accent except for one and it had nice little nuggets of story bits that's made the entire show interesting  to watch and if wasn't so over-dramatic, exaggerated and over the top with the acting (which is tolerable)  then  I would have given it 5 stars.",1397347200,,457,4.218390804597701

74139,4,0784011249,i gave it 4 stars because it was a nice simple little story.  I recommend this to urban people of all ages as a lesson not to get Caught Up like the name of the movie suggests.  Not anything mind blowing but a pretty quick film about urban crime mixed with a little bit of trickery and Jamaican reputational stereotypes.,1393459200,,320,4.316666666666666
74140,5,0784011249,Just a great overall life lesson movie to really learn from.  It also had some of my favorite actors from the late 90's in it !,1374796800,2,127,3.8846153846153846

7790828,4,0784011249,"I agree with DVR who reviewed this September 2017. I remember when this movie came out in 1998. I saw it 7 March 1998 at AMC Union Station Washington, DC. I had wanted to see US Marshalls, but it was sold out so instead I had to see another film. I chose Caught Up and was not disappointed. in the secondary choice.

Cynda Williams and her DD-Cup breasts could conquer any male. But let's start the story. Daryl Allen is a con who just finished five years and his second strike thanks to his foolish friend Trip. Paroled, he meets up with Vanessa Dietrich who bears an uncanny resemblance to his ex, Trish. The two fall in love after Daryl saves her from a gunman and Vanessa gets him a job with a shady businessman. This in turn leads to a few twists and turns (Perhaps One Too Many) but the film is still enjoyable even until the very end. I like how it was given a first person narrative. this helped the story but was not overly intrusive.

Leonard Maltin's Movie Review said this movie was a ""Bomb"" which I would absolutely disagree with. It was enjoyable and even had some humor. The discussion Woodbine has with Williams after their second brush with death is classic! I laughed so hard that I cried tears. Great and dry humor.
I gave this an 8.0 out of 10 at the time and that translates perfectly into a Four Star rating even 20 years later. By the way, see the scene stealing Jeffrey Combs who quotes Shakespeare. I didn't recognize him at the time (Weyoun From Star Trek Deep Space Nine). Buy this DVD and you will really like it despite what Maltin's review says. I'm the 39th person to review this DVD on Amazon.
