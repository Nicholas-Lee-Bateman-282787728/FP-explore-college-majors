8324665,5,B00004REFT,"What shall I say? I nearly watched all the movies of Ringo Lam. OK, Maximum Risk wasn't that good, but overall none of his movies (eg. WILD  SEARCH, FULL CONTACT, PRISON ON FIRE)ever disappointed me. I even liked it  better than THE VICTIM.
This is a movie about friendship, honor and  betrayal. The most frequent ingredients for a heroic bloodshed  movie.
Here there are two friends who were in the assassin business 12  years ago. One get caught, the other escapes. When he finally gets out of  the prison he is forced by his friend to kill a nominee for the president  in the Philipines. When he refuses, he gets accused by his friend.
Now  the Police, the Triad and a third party are looking for the  suspect....
Doesn""t sound very appealing but is really worth  watching. In addition the DVD of the 1998 film has a good picture and a  good sound. Even the subtitles are readable all the time!
Don't expect  silly non-stop action- or you will be disappointed. This is a high class  thriller with a plot!",965001600,5,1007,4.527777777777778
