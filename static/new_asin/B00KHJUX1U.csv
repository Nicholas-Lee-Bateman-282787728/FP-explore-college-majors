6429497,5,B00KHJUX1U,Loved this movie. Jennifer Jason Leigh is awesome. I feel she was never credited what she should be for her acting.,1424476800,,115,4.523809523809524
6429498,4,B00KHJUX1U,I just watched the moment. First of all it is not Jennifer best films. It was little hard to try understand were the director was going with the story. Apart from that I liked it. On the other hand take JJL out it would not be as good. I be honest i only brought it because of JJL. The best aspect she is in it as the main actress though out. It was better than i expected. 6 and half out of ten,1419465600,2,395,3.7710843373493974
6429499,2,B00KHJUX1U,"Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a war photographer suffering from severe PTSD and possible substance abuse problems after surviving a suicide bomb attack in Mogadishu and waking up in an American hospital.  Later her ex-boyfriend disappears and she thinks she might have killed him but she only remembers fragments and her memory is not reliable--plus there's no body.

Leigh gets to play the kind of fragile, emotionally shattered character that she has gravitated to repeatedly throughout her career--truthfully she could probably play this part in her sleep but Leigh's performance feels lived in and genuine.  The problem with The Moment is the storytelling which never creates any dramatic interest around the maybe or maybe not murder.

The Moment is dull and slow and it rarely feels like it's actually headed anywhere.  The relationship between mother and daughter (a petulant Alia Shawkat) never sparks like it should considering that their conflict is the central one in the movie.  Both of the male leads are played by Martin Henderson for dramatic purposes, a creative choice that backfires since he doesn't manage to make either of his characters interesting or even make them particularly different even though their personalities are supposed to be completely the opposite of each other.  The final shot is trying for ambiguous but doesn't quite make it.

It's nice to see Jennifer Jason Leigh in a rare lead role in her middle-age but doing good work in a lousy movie isn't likely to boost her career.",1417910400,5,1512,5.117886178861789

8659008,2,B00KHJUX1U,"I really wanted to like this. It broached some interesting topics and was almost successful at becoming a somewhat Hitchcockian psychodrama thriller. But it seemed like the writers gave up halfway through and didn't know how to flesh out what they started. At one point I thought, ""Is this going to be the female 'Memento'?"" -- because it is reminiscent of that movie in many ways.  Unfortunately it could not attain the heights of cleverness and super tight editing that Memento did. I recommend seeing it though if you're a fan of any of the actors. They did their best to make the material work, however, the material proved to be far beneath them.",1439942400,,651,4.7105263157894735
