7825329,5,6302341752,"This is Herbert von Karajan's first video of the great Requiem by Verdi. It comes from 1967 when he was still relatively young, only 57 years old. He collected all the best forces available: the Orchestra and Chorus of the Scala of Milan and some of the greatest soloists of all time. It is a magnificent performance. There is total commitment throughout, an almost religious devotion to the conductor and the work itself.
  That Karajan does this with the Scala forces immediately dispels the notion that he achieved all his fame due to the Berlin Philharmonic. The Orchestra plays with fierce intensity and precision that has  rarely been heard from them. And the Chorus of serious and devoted Italian women and men sing like angels.
  Karajan's concentration and total control is astonishing. His beat is almost unnoticeable, but  his tempi are always perfect and relentless. His delicate hands, featured often in the film, shape the melodies and inspire the entire ensemble. But he is also capable of the superhuman hammer blows of the Dies Irae sequence, which are shattering. Tuba mirum has rarely sounded more awe inspiring, sending shivers down on everybody's  spine. One could go on and on...
  The soloists certainly do justice.  Leontine Price , who sings without score, is  showing intense sorrow throughout and great drama at the final Libera me section, her crowning achievement in this performance.  Fiorenza Cassotto, one of the most underrated singers, is wonderfully mellifluous with her rich dark hued mezzo soprano voice (she also sings without a score). A young Pavarotti, his voice in its prime, is very impressive indeed.(he hasn't got the famous beard yet!) and Nicolai Ghiarov, probably the best basso of our generation, is beyond praise.
  Unfortunately,for some reason, Deutsche Gramophone, after releasing it in DVD, seems to have withdrawn or discontinued it. Right now they are only available onVHS and not too many of those either, so the price is exorbitant. Hopefully DGG will realize the problem and re-release the DVD soon.
In spite of all this I still highly recommend it.. It is an other worldly experience.

PS>  April 2006.  Good news:  Now re-released in DVD at very affordable price. Go for it.",1083628800,,2235,5.060109289617486
7825330,5,6302341752,"This is a 1967 film that presents some of the 20th century's greatest singers in their early career years - i.e., Leontyne Price, Luciano Pavarotti, Fiorenza Cossotto and Nicolai Ghiaurov - with a robust Herbert Von Karajan conducting La Scala's Orchestra.  Musically speaking this is as great a performance of the Requiem as one will ever see.  The cinematography is a bit rough by 21st century standards, however (e.g., instead of fade-outs, there are just cuts).  Nevertheless, this does little to distract one from the sheer beauty and genuis of the music that is produced.  One more note, this is one of very few instances where Price and Pavarotti share the spotlight; this only underscores the film's pricelessness in my book.  A must have for Verdi fans, or fans of any of the singers -- they are in superb form.",1072569600,,820,4.828571428571428
7825331,5,6302341752,"Almost ten years ago, the Vienna Philarmonic Chorus and Orchestra came together in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, to perform Mozart's ""Requiem."" The occasion was broadcast live in the UK, and I am very glad to see that it has also been released on video.
The story of Mozart's last great work is one of the most famous stories in music history, and is also shrouded in myth. What is undeniably true about the work is that when Mozart died, what he left of the ""Requiem"" was barely more than a sketch: the first movements ""Requiem aeternam"" and ""Kyrie eleison"" were completed in full score, but of the ""Dies Irae"" through to the ""Lacrymosa"" all that exists are chorus parts and an accompanying bass line. It fell to Mozart's pupil Franz Sussmayr to flesh out these remaining movements and finish the work, although Mozart left behind some fairly detailed ideas about how he wanted the work to end. Since that time, a number of editions have been made of the ""Requiem,"" some modelled on Sussmayr's completion, others ignoring it and working from the original torso. For this performance, Georg Solti opted to use a completion by Maunder which does not sound quite like the version I have heard and sung on a number of occassions.
Despite this slight unfamiliarity, the performance as a whole is excellent. Solti was a legendary conductor, but it seems to me that he was especially good with Mozart; indeed, he once said (in so many words) that Mozart's music was proof to him of the existence of God. Throughout this performance, the chorus sinks it's teeth into the music, the soloists are weighty and the orchestra captures the gravity and beauty of the score in a quite unique way. This performance is made all the more special by the fact that it was held as a liturgical event (the requiem that Mozart never had but richly deserved), hence there are clergy present and the music is woven into the order of the Missa pro Defunctis, complete with readings and sung music for the congregation in tandem with Mozart's music.
The result is an event to be savoured and remembered: a true ""Requiem"" for Mozart on the anniversary of his death, far better than any concert performance could have been. I have certainly not forgotten it - and this video is a timely, worthwhile souvenir. Strongly recommended!",980812800,,2304,4.7625
7825332,4,6302341752,"I just saw this video on public TV. ASSUMING that it's the same one (no description of it on this site), it was recorded at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna on the 200th anniversary (1991) of Mozart's death. I was struck  by the majesty of the Cathedral backdrop of the video. The soloists were  quite good as was the orchestra but the late Sir George Solti ate up the  screen whenever he was shown. His facial expressions and directions were  great fun to watch. I confess to never having seen him before today but  I've always enjoyed his directorship on recordings. When the camera was  facing him in a medium shot his torso was framed by the MAGNIFICENT altar  of St. Stephens - this made a powerful impression and I only wish more of  the cathedral would have been highlighted here and there, but the editing  was classy (my suggestion may have made it tacky). The version - yes, there  are different ones - of the Requiem here was not the one I have been  accustomed to, which is an edited version by C.R.F. Maunder which excises  (to the best of his ability) the additions composed after Mozart's death by  Franz Xaver Sssmayr (who had a few lessons from, of all people, Antonio  Salieri - irony of ironies!).  In this video they are still there, about  three of the last five movements.  I am no musical expert but it sounded  not quite as marvelous as the rest of the Requiem.  All-in-all, it was a  treat to watch and I'll likely buy it.  One strange thing: during the last  three or so movements you can actually see a few audience members LEAVING  the concert, seen partly behind the chorus and in one GLARING instance,  walking between sections of the wind instruments!  This is because of the  location of the orchestra and chorus, being placed in the nave, or center,  of the Cathedral.  How ANYONE could walk out on this work, or this  fantastic Cathedral, is beyond my comprehension.  It reminded me of  Southern California sport venues where most everyone leaves  early...disgusting.  The end of the concert came not with applause but the  ringing of the Cathedral bells - a fitting tribute to this great work!  Solti was a joy to watch!",947894400,3,2156,4.58421052631579
