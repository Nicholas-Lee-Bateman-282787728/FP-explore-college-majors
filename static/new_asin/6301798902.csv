It is a great early film by Nicolas Cage.  If you are a Nicolas Cage fan you will like this movie.",1230163200,,223,3.8043478260869565

370778,3,6301798902,"The boy in blue is a very simple story so many times seen before, about a distinguished rower, an absolute human marvel in what concerns to employ all his energies in order to compete and win.

As you may expect, there will be a nice girl and an obvious happy ending. It's so predictable that you should realize there' s nothing new under the sun, unless you as me watch it on an executive bus from Valencia to Caracas a Saturday morning. .",1181520000,,440,4.301204819277109
370779,4,6301798902,"I've enjoyed getting on the rowing machine at the gym; and day dream, if I were lucky enough to be one of those collegiate scullers; well, here is an interesting perspective on this sport; and just like ol' time American cycling with Major Taylor at the turn of the century; this movie shows, before full acceptance of American football; basketball etcetera, other sports were vying for the main stage of America's attention in the sports arena. I am not aware of the exact time frame but it is clearly from around some time back then, maybe the ""Great White Hope"" was from around the same era as well.

In some ways, maybe it does follow a sports movie format; underdog overcoming the odds like in Hoosiers or Rocky; but the sport is unique. Maybe if I were Canadian I'd give it 5 stars, 4 stars still shows it is a good movie; a real gem in fact.",1173225600,,848,4.401273885350318
370780,5,6301798902,Films on rowing are hard to find. This film is a great testament to the hard work it takes to excell at a difficult sport and is quite inspirational!  This is a true story of courage and grit. Anyone who likes rowing will enjoy this film.,1125619200,5,238,4.173913043478261
370781,4,6301798902,"This 1986 film features a very young, buff and brawny, athletic Nicholas Cage in the role of crude Canadian backwoods bootlegger, Ned Hanlan, who turned into a legendary world class rower. Discovered by an amateur oarsman and self styled entrepreneur named Bill (David Naughton), Ned, using a new style of boat with a sliding seat, is propelled to fame when he wins a race in Philadelphia against a heavily favored contender. His win was a total upset, bringing Ned under the scrutiny of a rich man's betting syndicate, headed by a wealthy man named Knox (Christopher Plummer).
Knox, a man used to having his way by any means necessary, makes Bill an offer he can't refuse. Knox then takes over Ned's future and gets him a professional trainer in order to prepare him for major races. In the meantime, Ned and Margaret (Cynthia Dale), Knox's comely niece, begin a flirtation that ultimately turns into a romance after much angst. When Ned finally gets an opportunity to race against the Australian world champion, he discovers to his consternation and dismay just how much faith Knox has in his ability to win. What follows next causes Ned to be banned from racing in the United States.
A chastened Ned, discarded by Knox, returns home and turns to Walter, the man who invented the boat with the sliding seat. He begs Walter to train him, so that he can enter and race in England on the Thames and vindicate himself. Walter really believes in him, so he gets Knox to agree to race his current boy wonder against his, but not before Walter has proffered Knox his life's dream. When the time for the race finally comes, betrayal, treachery, and skulduggery are the keywords of the day. To find out what happens during this career making race, and to discover what comes of the romance between Margaret and Knox, one should view this film. It will not disappoint.
Christopher Plummer leads the cast with his chillingly portrayal of the rich and unprincipled Knox. Nicholas Cage attacks the role of Ned Hanlan with boyish and engaging enthusiasm, while David Naughton delights with his portrayal of Bill, the former manager and erstwhile friend. Cynthia Dale is charming in the role of Margaret, the niece who finds herself adopting the role that she was pledged to play by her uncle. The rest of the cast is likewise uniformly excellent. This entertaining and informative film about a turn of the century athlete will fully engage the viewer.",1016236800,28,2439,4.809523809523809

370865,4,6301798902,"A fun rare Nic Cage film. This film is slow paced and the street fist fight scenes are not the greatest in chirography, but it was enjoyable. Nic Cage works with Christopher Plummer who gives another fine performance. I enjoyed the rowing scenes and races. If you like Nicolas Cage, you should check this film out. It is much better than the trashy stuff he has been doing in the recent years. Check it out for nostalgic value! It is based on a true story, so check out the real story as well.",1412121600,,493,4.311827956989247
