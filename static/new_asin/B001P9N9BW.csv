3745399,5,B001P9N9BW,"(NOTE:This review is in response to the original HBO presentation/airing and not of it's future home DVD release)

Presented and watched as one four hour block (with each of it's four parts averaging around 58 minutes each) this was one well cast and performed HBO/BBC production on the reign of Saddam Hussein. Showcasing the years between his take-over of the Presidency of Iraq in 1979 up thru his execution in 2006, this mini-series was well informative and even at it's length, not very dragging in parts. And don't think this is all about Saddam either, his family and fellow soldier/followers are in full force here too. And each part is extremely well-played, even reaching the point where recreated news-footage makes you think you're seeing the real thing. If there was any fault of this mini-series it lied in the final fourth act, basically showcasing Saddam's hiding exile, going from Iraq's largest leader to a pauper hiding in a hole (just like it was in real life). But not being a Hussein historian by any means (who'd want to?), I truly felt that this script followed the insane leader and those around him to a tee. Quite disturbing in parts without being too graphic (Saddam had a thing about his relatives getting to close to greatness...he didn't like it) and showing a side of the madman you may not expect (he loved film-making, especially if the star was playing him), this is one mini-series highly suggested to anyone who doubts taking him out of power wasn't the right thing to do or a neccesary evil. Would love to see some interviews with the cast on how each of them channeled these characters so well, will probably purchase this on DVD and sit through the dark-subject four hours even again.

3745495,5,B001P9N9BW,"I can never quite get over how hauntingly good this miniseries is. I watch it three or four times a year.

It gives a sympathetic biopic view of a cruel megolamanic and the interplay of politics in the ruling class of Iraq's always fragile police state. Betrayals flow like the blood they generate; life is cheap and so are the garish trinkets that everyone hangs on to to give life it's exaggerated but truncated meaning.

Saddam's castles reminded me of nothing if not Trump Towers in Atlantic City, which we reserved once, and upon arriving in our over priced room, immediately checked out, and went to the nearest Holiday Inn, greatly relieved.

Whether Trump or Saddam, garishness is a reflection of the inverted values that underwrites it. Dystopia and ruin is never far from the mind of anyone who lives in a state of inverted values, whether in a police state or a Trump Tower. So, as Omar Khayyam says, drink and be merry.

Even the rulers, like Saddam himself, knew that disaster always was just around the corner, that everything in a police state has a short shelf life, including life itself. The end was alway just out of sight. It had to come sooner rather than later.

As Saddam's favorite saying was: I know a betrayer before he knows himself. To that I say, yes, Saddam, that one is easy: everyone, sooner or later, will betray everyone else. Some logic, eh?

So Saddam, took the shortcut and killed his best friends first, under the pretext that any man who could kill his best friend in cold-blood, had no weaknesses. (How do you like them apples?) In the end, both Trump and Saddam proved that nothing from nothing leaves nothing, so you might as well rape and pillage and then crawl down the nearest rathole ... Or maybe, just run for president of the USA. It's all the same thing.

The acting was A-plus, even the peripheral actors were good, and that is the first sign of a first-class film. Five stars.",1470528000,3,1927,4.600583090379009

3745553,5,B001P9N9BW,"Many reviewers cite this series' lack of entertainment value while simultaneously praising its quality acting. I was thoroughly entertained by the premise alone and the acting only made the experience a relatable one. From what I understand, the series stays very true to the source material. Because of that, I found it a useful exercise in removing oneself from the thoroughly American narrative of good vs. evil. While I don't mean to apologize for Saddam the dictator's behavior, such a small but powerful glimpse at statecraft on the level of secondary, or arguably tertiary power, elucidates for the viewer the struggle between great powers and those whom they seek to moderate. I greatly enjoyed this series and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh viewing experience and a general understanding of Iraq during the reign of Saddam Hussein.",1431129600,,858,5.135714285714286

3745665,4,B001P9N9BW,"House of Saddam is a very well cast four part mini-series produced by the BBC and HBO that provides viewers with a peek into the dysfunctional mind and family dynamics of Iraq's late dictator Saddam Hussein, with a superficial overview that provides a mere glimpse into how his years in power affected those around him and the Iraqi people in general.

Seizing power by forcing the resignation of then President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr in 1979, Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti was president of Iraq and ruthlessly ruled as an absolute dictator for almost 24years until the US led invasion and his downfall and capture in 2003. This mini-series does not attempt to convey the full scope of the horrors endured by the Iraqi people during those years, but it does provide viewers with some insight into the clannish nature of Iraqi politics and the brutal lengths Saddam Hussein, his sons, and his followers were willing to go in order to retain their grip on power.

While it glosses over most of the true horrors perpetrated upon the Iraqi people, especially the Kurds and Shiites, the film does provide some mention of certain incidents, portrays the brutal assassinations of opponents, and gives viewers a brief glimpse into the sadistic behavior of Saddam's eldest son Uday.

More than anything else, this film lays bare the transformational nature and danger of allowing a Cult of Personality to form around a leader - any leader! It shows us how the once secular and rational Saddam Hussein gained absolute power, and by ruthlessly eliminating any rivals or opposition, and basking in the adulation of his terrified citizens, and surrounded by family and advisers who would not dare speak the whole truth to him, he became  more and more distant from reality, more and more paranoid, delusional, deadly.

All in all, an interesting look through the glass darkly, but where was Baghdad Bob????",1428969600,,1900,4.981072555205047

But we do see the in-house infighting, the rivalries among siblings, the flight of the family when Baghdad fell.

He is portrayed as a leader who is ruthless to prevent dissent but, at the same time, compassionate for the needs of his people. The Iran war basically bankrupted the country and the low oil prices afterwards kept living standards low. The movie does not, however, address his opulent palaces despite the lack of nutrition for the majority of his countrymen, the extreme excesses of his two sons, etc. It shows the first Gulf War as being green lighted by the US Ambassador at the time and the second as simply his not understanding how the Americans would think that he had WMD when he did not.",1413676800,,864,4.580645161290323

3746496,5,B001P9N9BW,"It doesn't get much juicier than this. First, the acting is superb. HBO does it again. Make no mistake, these actors are no schlubs faking it for the cameras, I ""bought"" Saddam Hussein as, well, Saddam Hussein. And Philip Arditti as the legendary indolent Uday was fantastic. His deadeye stare by itself almost warrants the price of admission. If half of this is true and it most probably is, these people were/are as perverse, power mad, angry, hungry and desperate as that other noted dictator, A H. As a matter of fact, it is intriguing to trace the parallels of ultimate weakness due to fear of Saddam, the rivening of the power structure due to family rivalries. Let's face it, it's Shakespeare all over again, but in the 21st century. What's striking is the naked revelation of the human behind it all, the repeated assertions on the part of Saddam's character that he will, ""make Iraq a country to be respected, by Arabs and the West.."" In other words, he wanted to count, to matter. How human is that? Too bad he saw the way forward as killing everyone and becoming an ultimate paranoiac. The strange thing I didn't expect was how much more sympathetic I became toward Gulf War 2 after watching this. If Saddam was the way things were, it's hard to argue that toppling him was not a good idea.",1411603200,,1301,4.587982832618025

3746512,4,B001P9N9BW,"We may miss some of the evil, but really that's the story we are all familiar with already. If there was one positive thing about Saddam, it was that he adored his family, and this does a fair job of expressing the human relationships that underscored a man considered by most to be nothing more than a villain.

There is plenty that HBO/BBC could have done to tell a more nuanced story, but ultimately they chose to try to tell this in four parts and decided to focus on the character relationships more than the intricacies of Saddam's political life. What is missed most is a proper picture of Iraq's turbulent ethnic makeup, and Saddam's rationalization for the positions he took, as well as the events that led to his downfall. Apparently he was incredulous that America would invade Iraq in 2003, and I think that his reasons for disbelief have grown into the demons that haunt the region today.

Der Untergang does a better job of showing the monster living underneath the human skin, but ultimately this is a compelling retelling of events from Saddam's perspective. Better than 99% of the garbage on television (that should really be HBO's motto) and well worth a watch.

Sometimes it is hard seeing those who commit atrocities as human beings, but unfortunately they happen to be made of the same stuff as the rest of us. The world isn't a black and white landscape of good-guys and bad-guys, like some of the more dimwitted among us would like to believe. It is incredibly uncomfortable to ponder on Saddam Hussein or Adolf Hitler experiencing love, loss, pain or fear, but the simple truth is that these emotions are not a monopoly of the kind-hearted or well intentioned. A monster can still love his family, and that family can still love a monster.",1410393600,,1763,4.699029126213592

I was relieved that although there is some violence in this series, obviously necessary for the story of Saddam, but it is not portrayed in pornographic grind-house detail, just enough information for historical purposes. My wife could watch this without too much trouble.

The constant fear that permeated all that served him was shown, as it became evident that Saddam would demonstrate his force of will, reminding me of the similarity to the Kyser Sorze character in The Usual Suspects. Saddam definitely had the same playbook. Like Stalin, he executed his generals when they didn't do what he expected them to do, never mind that he had no clue when it came to military tactics. The fear he generated lead to sycophantic yes-men around him, who withheld bad news and told him what he wanted to hear, with severe consequences if Saddam found out the truth. Damned if you do, damned if you don't type of existence, and this was chillingly portrayed.

The series shows the subtle change of Saddam from a political thug into a much more dangerous megalomaniac who believed his ancestry to be linked to the Great Prophet and Saladin, becoming eerily similar to the mythologies and the denial of reality that Hitler used.

Iraq had so much potential and could have become a modern rich trading nation, the people were highly educated, but the ambitions and prejudices of a man who said, ""The law is what I say it is"" ruined it. His invasion of Kuwait was portrayed as a desperate attempt to revive his nation's economy ruined by the war with Iran by the only way he knew how, more war.",1401926400,,1750,4.731147540983606

The Iraqis lived very well under Saddam.  There were NO taxes - no income tax, no sales tax, no property tax.  All of their utilities were free!  Electric, water, sewer, phone, and if they got sick, they paid the hospital a small percentage of the cost.  Everything was paid from oil revenues.

Aside from all that, Saddam was a murdering thug.  As long as he didn't suspect you, you lived very well.  But he was ruthless, but then, politicians are.

Not for kids.  And a study of of what could occur if some of the insane are given Keys to the Kingdom and allowed free reign.

We may never know how much of Latif Yahia's ""body double"" story is actually true, at least 4 others who were in the ""know,"" of the inner Saddam circle, interviewed separately,  raise objections among which are:
--Uday never used body doubles
--as an associate so close to the Saddam family, the CIA would have never let Latif go so easily, so valuable of source he would have been
--who the heck is Latif Yahia?

Latif disputes all objections, but in any case, the ""body double"" plot device is a useful movie method to have a peek into Saddam's regime and Uday Hussein in particular.  How such a creature as Uday could be allowed to roam around loose without a leash, killing and raping whomsoever he casteth angry or lustful eye upon is astoundingly unbelievable.  But the numerous stories and documentation to emerge from that fallen regime, confirms exactly those vile, unbridled appetites of Saddam's eldest son.

One reason, according to a commentator, why the elder Bush stopped short of deposing Saddam in the first Gulf War was Uday or perhaps the less  awful  but still bad boy younger brother Qusay Hussein.  One of them  might take over and things could get worse.

The main actor , Dominic Cooper, in my view, plays well the whiny and dangerously homicidally erratic Uday as well as the more demure, reluctant body double, Latif.

The luscious Sarrib, (Ludivine Sagnier) I do not know exactly if she is just a victim of Uday as she claims, or something else, but often what separates narrative from documentary is the insertion of some kind of love interest for the main character, especially if there is a triangle involved.  As things developed, I wondered if an epic confrontation would develop over Sarrib and how that sub-plot would ultimately resolve.

As real life would have it, according to Latif, there was a moment where a woman, Uday was interested, in paid more attention to Latif. Uday shot at Latif, and from there, Latif, implemented his exit strategy.  However, I got the impression that this woman was short term, possibly not known to Uday more than a few days before.  This was unlike, as the movie portrayed,  the developing long term relationship of Sarrib, Uday and Latif.

Saddam Hussein was not a focus in this film, but whenever he appeared, the man exuded an unquestioning terrifying menace.

4 out of five stars, based on a true story of which some of it is actually true. And, after all his mayhem, maybe the filmakers could have did a final short scene ""the Siege of the Sons of Saddam"" where they cut ahead and  200 troops with attack helicopters aided by an A-10 ""Warthog;""  after 4 hours of battle, finally put the beast to bed. And Latif, those years later, his reaction, as he read about it or saw it on TV.  Latif is said to remark at the world premiere of the Devil's Double at Sundance: ""I smile because I am alive and Uday, he is buried.""

3746708,3,B001P9N9BW,"I think half the problem here in this lavish and well-acted production was its makers had no heavenly idea where on earth they wanted to go with the story they were trying to tell, and so what resulted was one of the more muddled, messed-up letdowns in recent big-budget TV history. The acting was good, the settings and sets themselves were amazing, but the plot was headache-inducing in its lack of direction. The film spent hours concentrating on rather drawn-out side stories and ignored opportunities to present gripping history as it unfolded on the Iraqi side of the battle lines. As I watched, I kept wondering when we would eventually get to certain pivotal events that were of great interest to me and I suspect to many others, and guess what? We never did.

There was no apparent attempt to demonize or glorify in this story. Maybe it's a little unrealistic because of this. I enjoyed the film and the ending had an exciting portrayal of the attack and killing of the sons.
If there were many movies about this theme then maybe this film would be rated lower, but there isn't much competition.",1252454400,,465,4.482352941176471
3746715,4,B001P9N9BW,"As a production this is an awesome film. The acting is superb (expecially the actor who played Udai... he made a convincing psycho) and while not as wide-ranging as I would have liked it did make a convincing show of the progress of history.

With that being said, there is much which is left unsaid. The movie begins with the point where Saddam, then Vice-President of Iraq, deposes the sitting president. However, Saddam's struggle for power began significantly earlier. In 1959 he had attempted to assassinate Qassim in, the military dictator who himself overthrew Faisal II. He sprayed bullets indiscriminately and apparantly ruined the planned attack. He managed to escape and in 1963 he became head of Iraq's security apparatus following a Ba'athist coup. He had a reputation for routinely using torture and terror against potential enemies and his role in that regime probably led to its overthrow. When the Ba'ath returned Saddam took measures to ensure that true democracy would never be a feature of Iraq. These things are not discussed in the movie at all, except for a brief couple of minutes in which an Iraqi movie is being made about Saddam's life.

Very little is made of the cult of personality that Saddam initiated after he assumed the role of President. You see billboards on the street and that sort of thing but Saddam's image was everywhere: stamps, books, watch faces, monuments, money... just about anything would have Saddam's image or a quotation from him. Nothing is shown of the secret police either, when an off-handed comment could land you in a prison and might even cost you your life.

The timeline of the story is usually correct but the events surrounding Desert Storm are off. At one point the Iraqis are talking about the Coalition crossing into Kuwait and how they would soon be crossing into Iraq. In fact, the far left wing of the line was the first to jump off, directly into Iraqi territory in order to reach the Euphrates and cut off the bulk of Iraq's army (I know because I was there, with the XVIII ABN Corps). Saddam gave the order for the Republican guard to pull back to Baghdad but in fact the guard, which was sitting astride the Kuwaiti/Iraq border, was waiting to go SOUTH and was already in the process of being engaged by VII Corps. All the RGC divisions were hit and several virtually ceased to exist after Coalition armor got through with them.

Another funny line from that scene is Qusay's comment that the regular Iraqi army units were retreating and ""not even the Americans would attack retreating troops."" Somehow, I don't thing these words passed the lips of one of Saddam's ruthless henchmen.

The sudden surprise cease-fire is another joke. You can bet the cease-fire was directly authorized by Saddam: someone else didn't have to tell him about it. Also, Coalition forces did not begin withdrawing on the day of the cease-fire... further forces were held back but the lines held for a couple of weeks.

Nothing is said of the uprisings north and south, even though one group of Iraqi dissidents ambushed Udai's vehicle and badly injured him. Even if this is mostly supposed to be about Saddam's family, THAT fact should have been mentioned. He walked with a limp after that.

Finally, during the part of the film that looks at the Coalition effort to find Saddam after the fall of Baghdad, a captured Iraqi is unhooded and it looks as if he has been beaten during interrogation. This is a flat-out lie. I would like to know if that information is supposedly published somewhere or if the film maker added it because ""everybody knows that's what Americans do.""

I still give this four stars for its acting and production values. But while it is entertaining it is hardly a thorough depiction of this story.",1249084800,,3772,4.783410138248848

3746717,5,B001P9N9BW,"This four-part British mini-series follows the life of Iraq's brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein, from his ascension to power to  American troops discovering him hiding in a hole in the ground, after they invaded Iraq.  Whatever news stories, magazine articles or television programs you  might have seen or read about  Saddam Hussein, this film brings you up close and gives you a truly intimate picture of his life.
One of the most interesting aspects of Saddam was his wily intelligence.  He understood power and how to enforce it.  He understood that total political control meant eliminating any and all sources of weakness or threats to one's status.  And, one by one, he eliminates family and friends if they stand in his way or appear less than totally loyal.
His family and mistress (later to be his second wife) are clearly portrayed. The acting throughout is excellent, the  story gripping and well-scripted.  This 2 disc set is highly recommended.  The DVD has a bonus feature which gives the aftermath of what happened to all the characters.",1245456000,2,1051,4.988505747126437
3746718,3,B001P9N9BW,"If this miniseries had gone a little deeper into the background and scope of Iraqi politics it would certainly deserve another star, since it is really very well done, as far as it goes.  The real weakness of the series lies in the very superficial look at the private life of Saddam, without going into any particular aspect in depth. There was a whole lot more that could have been included, so as to give the thing more weight and substance.
As it is, we are given a sort of Hollywood reenactment of some of the seemier aspects of Saddam Hussein and his family, albeit very well interpreted by Yigal Naor as Saddam.  He is a really commanding presence and thoroughly credible in the principal role, which lends the series much of its authenticity. The rest of the cast is variable, although the rather important character of Kamel Hussein comes over as very wooden. Tariq Aziz, however, is just fine, and Saddam's son, Uday, is more or less what one would imagine him to be.
Notwithstanding its limitations, this is a very watchable miniseries, which, as I have said, would have merited a higher rating if only it had gone a little deeper into the subject.",1242345600,13,1159,4.621359223300971

3746720,4,B001P9N9BW,"This mini-series has a lot going for it. The acting is generally top notch with the actor playing Saddam particularly convincing.  The production values are also quite high.

My one (major) criticism is that the story leaves out the two greatest crimes Saddam presided over.

The first is the brutal al-Anfal campaign in which Saddam's minions --at his command-- murdered tens of thousands of Iraqi Kurds, acts of genocide that included the use of chemical weapons against civilians.  I think ""House of Saddam"" devotes about one sentence to that atrocity.

The second is Saddam's savage suppression of the Kurdish and Shi'ite uprisings against his rule immediately following the first Gulf war (which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians and rebels alike).

Oddly, the mini-series shows with some detail the relatively minor atrocity committed by Saddam against the village of al-Dujail where an attempt to assassinate him took place...This was the crime that he actually was executed for, but it pales in comparison to the crimes I've mentioned above.

So I'd recommend watching House of Saddam for entertainment value and because it brings to life some of the most memorable moments in Saddam's reign.  But I'd read a full biography for the whole sordid story.",1241049600,15,1277,5.1352657004830915
3746721,4,B001P9N9BW,"It's ironic that Saddam is being played by the excellent Arab speaking ""Rendition"" Israeli co-star Igal Naor, whose parents came to Israel from Iraq after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war when 800,000 Arab-Jews became refugees and were absorbed by the State of Israel while Palestinian refugees were to remain in squalid refugee camps by their Arab brothers.",1240963200,,351,5.285714285714286
3746722,3,B001P9N9BW,"This a four hour dramatized mini-series that was originally on HBO, as noted before. Although I'm no expert on Saddam, it's hard not to have absorbed a modicum of information about Iraq and its long-time leader if one has at all followed the news in recent decades (which I have). That said, this series certainly could have shown way more of the brutality and evil of the Saddam regime than it did. If the producers might argue ""It was more about the inner circle than it was about the country as a whole"" I could only reply that Saddam dominated his country to such an extent--the way Stalin did the Soviet Union--that the two are inextricably linked. So the question arises, why didn't we see the rape rooms, the torture of children, the gassing of the Kurds (surely a true low point), and the draining of the ancient swamps in the south of Iraq? Not that the series was a puff job, but with these aspects all missing, one has to wonder what exactly the producers had in mind? That Saddam betrayed and executed people we see (especially when he seized power), that his family was nasty (especially Uday, his elder son) we learn too--but that doesn't tell the whole story. Were they constricted by their collaboration with the BBC? I don't know, but even if they were, these things still could have been dealt with without being overly explicit.
So, overall, worth watching, but the question of omissions still nags.",1240876800,,1418,4.653386454183267

All the rest of the actors did a great performance as well. hbo is not accurate history but gets the point across on the ruthlessness and barbaric personality of saddam. this film compliments the doccumentary Uncle Saddam.
