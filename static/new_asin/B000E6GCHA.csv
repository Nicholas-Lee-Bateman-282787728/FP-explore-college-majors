2500575,5,B000E6GCHA,"I have been using the Firm vidoes for about 6 months now and see a big difference. They are really working well to help smooth the back of my legs! I have gotten so much use from their videos thus far, so I thought I would get this to see if it could specifically target my problem area to help it along. It is a great workout. Hard to believe it is only 30 minutes. I pair this with the jiggle free arms to get a great kick butt work out!",1171065600,6,439,3.8351648351648353
2500576,5,B000E6GCHA,"Pam Cauthen Merriweather is an excellent Firm leader.  This is a short (35 minute) lower body workout that is a good challenge for the intermediate to advanced Firm user.  Additionally, the use of the compound movement on the incline and the varied type leg presses definitely increases your heart rate.  The only issue on this workout is the segment on the step; it increases your heart rate; however, there is an interval between doing the other leg and this creates a weakness in the other leg portion of the workout.  It is recommended that you fast foward so that both legs are done one after the other and go back to the exercise in the middle of the two.  In combination with Jiggle Free Arms, it is a nice, solid over 60 minute workout.",1169251200,2,744,4.522388059701493
2500577,5,B000E6GCHA,This is a great lower body workout in a short time!!  I like how it alternates between cardio and toning.  One of my favorites.  Jiggle free arms is great too!!!,1161648000,3,161,4.3
2500578,4,B000E6GCHA,"This 30-minute workout is a cardio/weight training workout in one.  It is fast paced, so it's best to view this workout several times before using it.  You also need the stepper apparatus that is seen in the workout for best result.  But once you've used this dvd, you don't need to do any other workout for the rest of the day.  For a companion dvd try Firm Yoga to Stretch out what you worked.  For the more experienced yoga practitioner try Rodney Yee's Advanced yoga, there is a great hip workout that stretches out your hips and back.",1148256000,14,539,4.459183673469388
2500579,5,B000E6GCHA,This is a great DVD a must have.. i almost did not purchase it but i am glad that i did.. you will see results,1147564800,2,110,3.44
2500580,3,B000E6GCHA,I've done a lot of firm videos. This is not my favorite. The transitions are too quick and I don't feel it worked my buns like the FIRM lower body sculpt I. It did raise my heart rate and I felt it in my legs at times but I was disappointed. Her transitions are difficult to understand at times as well.,1146441600,7,303,3.9836065573770494
2500581,4,B000E6GCHA,"This is another workout from the Firm Transfirmer series which introduces the Transfirmer, a 2 part piece of equipment similar to the Fanny Lifter but longer in length more like a traditional step.  You can use the 6 and 8 inch pieces individually, stack them together for a 14 inch platform used for leg press, in an incline position, or side by side resembling a staircase.  The incline and staircase positions are used quite a bit in this workout.  If you do not have the Transfirmer though, a normal step box and a higher step stool would work.  You will also need some dumbells.

Pam Cauthen Meriwether leads this 34 minute workout, she is joined by 4 fellow Firm master instructors, including Alison who shows beginner modifications.  You start with a warmup using the Transfirmer in the side by side position.  Then you will proceed into the first sculpting segment, starting with squats later adding a rear leg lift, then you will move into side lunges placing your foot on the shorter piece of the Transfirmer.  An option here is to put the Transfirmer in its incline position for side lunges, I often do this as it feels more comfortable to me.  Then you will do another set of squats, this time adding an optional foot lift, progessing all the way to leaving your foot off the ground as you stand back up, very tough, something to work towards.  After that you will do side lunges on the other leg and finish out with a set of deadlifts which end with one squat held for several counts.

The first cardio segment is next, you will leave the Transfirmer in it's side by side position.  The segment is a little tricky but not too bad.  You start with basic steps, then pivoting to the side progressing into what is called ""Hot Cross Buns"" which is actually a lot of fun once you get it down.  Calf pumps, plyo jumps and shallow lunges to the rear are other moves you will see in this segment.

Time for more sculpting work, this segment is tough.  Pam calls for medium weights and one would be wise to listen to her here.  You will put the Transfirmer in it's incline position, and put your legs in a lunge position, with the front leg placed on the blue portion (8 inch).  You will step to the top and dip off the back, gradually adding more components to the set, such as floating the foot to the front, adding a rear leg lift/knee sweep to the front, and pulsing the leg behind you.  Once you are done with all that you step off and immediately do a set of dips with the opposite leg.  Following this you will do a set of front lunges onto the incline, adding a rotation with the waist towards your knee.  You will do these on one leg then go right into the other, then you will repeat the dip sequence on the other side.  I normally use 12-15 pound weights for most lower body work, I used 10's here and still found it quite challenging, really ups the heartrate too.  Not to mention it is really easy to lose your balance here, I have a few times.

More cardio is next, you leave the TF in it's incline position.  This segment is not quite as tricky, you will see basic steps, straddles, press steps, hamstring curls, over the tops and repeaters here.  Some of the step are performed on the 8 inch portion for more intensity.

The final sculpting segment is next, leg presses which are the Firms signature move.  You will start on one side and alternate exiting off the back and to the side, 4 reps each and then 2 reps each, then you will finish a couple pulsing reps before pressing up to the top.  Then you repeat on the other leg.  Following this are tall box climbs, which don't require weights.  You will alternate narrow and wide climbs, alternating legs.  To finish out this segment you will do some hover squats adding an optional leg slide if you choose, then you will do some plie squats adding a heel lift, then you will hold the final rep at the bottom and pulse a few times.

Last cardio segment is hi-lo impact, you will leave the Transfirmer in it's 14 position and you will move around it and use it for certain moves.  Here you will see marches, step touches, low jacks w/arms, calf pumps w/optional criss crossing of the legs, grapevines, toe taps to the TF, runners lunges and rear leg extensions.  Then it's time to cooldown and stretch it out.

This is quite a workout in 34 minutes, I found I had to go lighter in weight for most of the weight work.  I have many Firm workouts, and most of them have the same lunges, squats and leg presses, here you see them too, but with interesting twists and different variations.  It is nice to change things up a little and that the Firm is becoming more creative by adding a little flavor to the tried and true exercises.  I thought this workout was quite challenging.  I often do this workout in conjunction with Jiggle Free Arms, and I get a total workout along with cardio in a hour.  This series is great and they really got it right with the Transfirmer.  It is a great piece of equipment and it's very sturdy and stable.  I use it for all my workouts Firm or not, and I like the versatility.  Overall a great workout, you get a lot accomplished in just over 30 minutes.  Pam as always does a great job leading the workout as well.",1143936000,45,5213,4.378772112382935
2500682,5,B000E6GCHA,This is a great product. I told me friends about this amazon DVD as well. I am very pleased with this item.,1383868800,,107,3.909090909090909
2500683,5,B000E6GCHA,"I want to give my feed back about my service. great professional service.just what I ordered and new like promised. I received it on time, and what a great price. Am a fan of the these firm workout with the transfomer and fanny lifter. Thank you very much. LuJuana Collins  rated your product five(5) STARS",1328832000,,306,4.5636363636363635
2500684,5,B000E6GCHA,"This is another wonderful, short Firm workout that incorporates a bit more cardio.  It takes a few times to get the moves down, but again, when you are a working mom with kids and can't spend half a day working out, showering, going to work, etc, this workout will give you results.  I've been a ""FIRM"" believer ever since the very first video came out over 20 years ago.",1257033600,,371,4.36231884057971
2500685,2,B000E6GCHA,I do love the firm but this isn't one of their great videos.  There is a lot more low impact cardio then needed  - If I have 30 minutes to fix my back side I want a focused work out.  The transitions are very fast and the music is more of a cardio based genre.  If you have any ankle or knee issues you may struggle feel some pain.  Try other firm lower body work outs they give you more focus and you will feel it the next day.,1231632000,6,428,3.764044943820225
2500686,3,B000E6GCHA,If you read the reviews for all Firm products you'll see the same exact reviews for different products. It sounds fishy like the company wrote a bunch of reviews and copied and pasted to all their products. I'm not sure how good these are but I would try just one at time to make sure we're not being suckered into buying.,1213142400,10,322,4.295081967213115
2500687,5,B000E6GCHA,"This is a really good, very intense lower body (buns and thighs) workout. I must admit that it is still difficult (in intensity) for me after using the video for a month now. Please note that you must allow yourself time to get the moves down.  The program moves quickly but I had an easier time catching on to this workout than other firm videos I own.  The workout is hard and I get a bit winded at times which causes me to pause the video to catch my breath. I consider myself fairly fit and trim but I found this workout to be a good challenge. It has produced noticable results for me which is excellent and motivating. I would recommend it for ladies who need to do some intense target training on their lower bodies but like to get the heart rate pumping and burn some major calories at the same time.",1202428800,9,808,4.240259740259741
2500688,5,B000E6GCHA,"OMG!!!I did this workout on a Wednesday and on Friday I am still sore. The mix of lower body and cardio is great. This is a definant keeper. She really kicks your butt. Invest in the Transfirmer unit, it might be cheaper on The Firm web site.",1194566400,3,242,4.170212765957447
2500689,4,B000E6GCHA,"I've only done this one once, but I like it.  I work out with The Firm multiple times per week, and this one left me sore the next day (which I really love, actually!!)  The hot cross buns move is really tricky for me, so I'm going to have to work on that one for a while.  Overall recommend it.",1191801600,4,295,3.8833333333333333
2500690,5,B000E6GCHA,"For 30 minutes, this workout is as good as Cardio Split 1 (the lower body segment of that video). Pam is one of my favorite Firm instructors! She gives excellent cueing, and the steps are easy as they are fun! Good lower body moves, along with some fun stepping cardio! Grade A+!!",1189468800,2,280,4.403846153846154
2500691,5,B000E6GCHA,"The bouts of cardio in between toning exercises helps keep your heart rate up but also keeps the next day soreness down.  It took me two or three times to get the routine but then it was all good from there.  Pam is an okay instructor, kind of bland.  I prefer Firm instructors Allie or Stephanie Huckabee.  This will still really whip your butt into shape - they're not kidding with the ""Visible results in 10 workouts!""",1174262400,4,421,4.428571428571429
8106631,4,B000E6GCHA,"Great workout, could be longer.",1523145600,,31,5.4
8106632,4,B000E6GCHA,"Love the transFIRMer series (you do need to have the transFIRMer to do the video), this one will work your booty & thighs to the max & this is one of my favorite trainers / hosts from the firm as well.  You need one set of weights for the workout, but there's a lower impact woman you can alternately follow on the video as well, who doesn't use weights.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because it can be a little hard to follow some of the moves the first few times through, when they get going really fast & you don't have it all down yet.  But once you have it down & know the flow, it's a really fantastic workout!",1521849600,,632,4.04

8106635,4,B000E6GCHA,"Well seeing that I never received this item its hard to say.  The Firm is great though I have the Fanny Lifter, Sculpting Stick and other great DVD's from them.  Their claim about visible results in ten workouts is true, as long as you keep with it you will see results.  After a week of doing the workouts people were asking me if I'm working out!  So I'm sure this DVD is equally as good.",1468972800,,390,4.16
8106636,5,B000E6GCHA,This is a really good Firm workout. Short but thorough. I liked the tall box sequence and Pam is always an excellent lead. The first part did seem rushed but then it calmed down. Very good Lower body workout.,1467158400,,208,4.358974358974359
8106637,5,B000E6GCHA,I really do like the transfirmer series. I needed third one to round or the collection and it definitely met my expectations.,1460332800,,125,4.7272727272727275
8106638,3,B000E6GCHA,It was ok some of the same exercises from the transfirmer total body sculpt with Allie I love the firm just this one particular DVD was not for me. The old school firm with the purple and blue steps total body sculpt hover and squats are still a challenge just increase the weight.,1430870400,,281,4.320754716981132
