470983,5,6302484367,"George Romero's independent 1968 feature ""Night of the Living Dead"" stands as one of the true masterpieces of horror film.  Be warned if you have not seen this film:  It is brutal, bleak, and relentless.  The film is far more than simple gore and violence, though; it is, whether intentionally or not, a commentary on American society, television, and the decay of the family.  While these topics were certainly a propos in 1968, they seem especially salient today.  This film was remade in 1990 under the same title and spawned two sequels, ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead.""  Of the three spawn, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is easily the best.

471027,1,6302484367,"The movie is fantastic, obviously, but the blu-ray conversion is absolutely terrible.  All they did was take an old print and turn it into a blu-ray release.  Do not waste your money on this version (50th Anniversary Edition). They made no attempt to clean up the video or audio.  Also there is no real digital copy.  The digital copy is on some third rate streaming site and does not work at all.  Tried multiple times on multiple days...no luck.

471030,3,6302484367,Night Of The Living Dead is a classic horror film and considered one fo the best ever made.

I absolutely LOVE this movie BUT the video quality on this version is HORRIBLE. It looks like a blurry, bootleg, homemade copy or WORSE even.

Elite's Millennium Edition as well as their Special Collector's Edition and 2008's 40th anniversary editions are all crystal clear, vibrant black & white and all are packed with special bonus features including  audio commentaries and an awesome documentary (the 40th anniversary edition).

The picture quality of Mill Creek's Blu-ray is nothing less than horrendous , bleached out and scratchy throughout.  No extra features at all.  A still menu.

It was so terrible I stopped the film and put in my 40th Anniversary of the film by Dimension Extreme to compare the two films quality. The 40th Anniversary edition blew the 50th Anniversary out of the water with its quality. Very disappointed in this 50th anniversary, only shows that someone is trying to make money off the film again by saying 50th anniversary & blu ray & digital copy.

Far from it, as the first minute of the movie rolls by with film scratches, specks and dirt. This is NOT a remaster. It appears to be a simple transfer from film to Blu-Ray without any clean-up whatsoever. At about 1:22 into the film, scratch lines can be seen on the left side of the screen for a couple of minutes and then at 1:28 other scratches on the film appear. Around 1:30 big scratches appear and move back and forth on the screen and remain until the end of the movie.

471259,2,6302484367,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE this MOVIE. The 50th Anniversary Blu-ray is what I am giving 2 stars to. In the early 2000s, I bought the best DVD version of Night of the Living Dead that was available - the Elite Entertainment ""Millennium Edition."" The picture on that DVD looked fantastic, the contrast was spot on, and it had a decent amount of extras. This Blu-ray can't compare to that DVD in quality. I want to say upfront that this purchase was due to my lack of research. I follow any news about the Romero zombie movies because I grew up around where they were filmed. There IS a 4K restored version that is coming out, and I mistakenly thought this was it.

As soon as the movie started, I noticed that the light greys looked pale, the black areas were crushed, and the whole image looked flat, like a bad photocopy. It looked like something you may have watched in a small CRT TV that was using rabbit ear antennas when you were a kid. There are lines, pops, and blemishes in the image. The audio is only in 2.0 stereo, which isn't a big deal, considering the source material. It doesn't sound particularly good, though. There are NO extras, only subtitles. The digital copy requires you to visit Mill Creek's website and watch it there in a browser window.

The reason there are so many unauthorized versions of dubious quality is due to a mistake when the movie was released - the copyright was left off. Because of this, the movie is considered public domain, so anyone with a print can release it on video. Buyer beware, and do some research beforehand. Usually I'm pretty good at that, but I got excited and got the 2 versions confused. The one you are going to want isn't available as of October 2017.

The movie itself is simple and familiar, but still holds up well. Zombies rise, strangers get stranded in an abandoned farm house, and the real monsters reveal themselves in the group of survivors. I can only imagine what it must have been like to unsuspecting audiences when it was released. The movie is relatively short, it doesn't have much action, and the ending is depressing, but it is rightfully considered a classic. Romero would go on to make 5 sequels to Night of the Living Dead, with plenty of social commentary, gore, and scares. This is where it all started, though.

One last note - Night of the Living Dead was released on October 1, 1968. This Blu-ray was released on October 3, 2017. That would make it the 49th anniversary, NOT the 50th!

471357,5,6302484367,"Several things need to be cleared up about NOTLD in general. First, the original screenplay is by John Russo, whose contribution should never be diminished as to the creation of the 1968 original. Moreover, the collaborative nature of the Image Ten team that developed the movie should also never be overshadowed by George Romero's deserved legacy as a cinematic master. What made NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD endure? Much of it has to go to the actors. Aside from Duane Jones--brilliant--there is a startling performance by Judith O'Dea as Barbara, more powerful and nuance with each viewing. Acting in large part a non-verbal role, O'Dea masterly creates horror, terror, fear, and--finally--heroism like few other film heroines of the last century. (By comparison, the 1990's remake's Barbara by Patricia Tallman is admirable, but not in the same league.) In fact, having watched this movie--and parts of it--many times, I am more impressed by the performances. But at several film experiences over the years, I've heard barbarous audiences hoot at and make fun of O'Dea's Barbara (the behavior of moviegoers has been, for around fifty years, less than stellar, but, alas a sign of dumbed-down, desensitized, crude times). Like Candace Hilligoss in CARNIVAL OF SOULS, Judith O'Dea captures what is very difficult to convey by performers: the non-verbal palette of emotions and mental processes. (Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, and Kyron Schon are also particularly adroit in their roles.) However, remember that praise needs to be lavished on Image Ten, I believe. This is not to gainsay Romero, of course, but of all the ""Living Dead"" films and epigoni, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD still stands out as the finest, a sterling product of its times, its people, its sociology, its technology, its politics.",1506470400,,1799,5.185567010309279

While modern zombie films rely heavily on advanced effects to deliver their scares, Night of the Living dead utilizes its sophisticated storytelling and social satire to maximum effect. Recent projects like The Walking Dead have prospered greatly, borrowing its familiar narrative of a group of survivors trapped in a remote location, at odds with each other as well as the undead legions clawing at their barricaded holds.

The film does show its age from time to time. The quality of the makeup effects showcased in unforgiving close-ups and exaggerated takes, reminiscent of the period, are at times jarring.

471384,2,6302484367,"Update:  The Criterion Release is scheduled for February 2018 and is now up for pre-order at Amazon.

For clarity, the Criterion release will most likely be a Five Star release, as it was supervised by Romero himself. The Two Star rating here is for the Mill Creek release. The following contains information on both the Mill Creek and Criterion releases.

This review has been updated to include information on the forthcoming but unannounced Criterion release as well as more specifics about the print sources for the various Blu-ray editions, as I have received requests for more information. Because the update considerably lengthens this Blu-ray review, here is the short version:  this release is not worth the money if you can wait for the Criterion release and afford it but, in opposite, is worth the money if you can't wait or if you don't want any of the other Blu-rays currently circulating around the globe. I shall explain....

To begin, this review is specific to the Mill Creek Blu-ray release, ASIN  B074JQKX2X and details what is known at this time. To be clear, the Mill Creek release is not the remastered edition nor is it from some novel source. This is the same print that has been floating around for years, full frame, missing visual information, not even as good as the Millennium DVD we all bought fifteen years ago, with all of those special features, or even the budget German and Japanese Blu-rays that came out a few years ago, which provided features and subtitles. (As an aside, when Mill Creek says ""Digital"", please be aware that they do NOT mean that you will get a UV code to redeem with the vendor of your choice. ""Digital"" for Mill Creek means that it comes with a copy via their own, private, streaming service which streams their own, private, transfers, of the type and quality you see on their sets of 50 and 100 films.)

To expand this review, as some have written to me in a state of confusion, it is important that you understand that celluloid film worked in a very specific way. There was one, and only one, original celluloid film strip, cut together by the director and the editor, from all the original celluloid strips of all that they had filmed, into one cohesive film. Then, that master original was taken to a facility where prints, identical prints, were copied off of this one master. Then, for this film, non-identical prints were made of the copies of the original, as it fell into public domain immediately, due to an accidental failure to include the copyright mark. And so, again, this is the same print that has been floating around for years. Mill Creek has claimed it is from an ""original print"", not the master and not a copy of an original print, which means one of the original identical prints made from the master original, of which there were so very many,  was used to make this transfer. All of the prints of the film were the same, or as near as was possible back in the day, and the difference lies in how the celluloid was handled and cared for from then to now as well as in how the digital print is encoded onto the Blu-ray itself. Mill Creek has clarified that they did their own unsupervised transfer of the film off of one of the original PRINTS with no statement as to the quality of the print, where it was housed, how it was stored, etc, and has, in making that statement, confirmed that it was not the master original, which we already knew since Janus owns that one. And so, to my understandably confused questioners, as to the quality of the Mill Creek release, this will look much like the other transfers from that source (that source being one of the best available of the identical prints floating around the world in various states of decay). The German release, the Happinet in Japan, the British and so on and so forth, all used original prints (the copies made way back when) and did their own unsupervised restorations with varying degrees of success. Most people prefer the Happinet release at this point, in case you are wondering.

That having been said, the forthcoming 4K remaster which was completed by Romero himself, for Janus Films, the company that owns Criterion, will be released by Criterion on Blu-ray in the foreseeable future. Romero completed his restoration on the ORIGINAL, that is to say the master, not a print, be it an original print or a copy of a print. After Janus Films' theatrical release of the restoration, this October, and after the special features Romero also supervised and participated in creating have been combined with the old restored features to complete the Criterion Edition, you can expect one big, beautiful, Night of the Living Dead masterpiece, absolutely guaranteed to be the definitive edition of the film.

If you simply can't wait and must have a Blu-ray right now, by all means, wait for Mill Creek's to hit seven or eight dollars and pick up your bare-bones Mill Creek release, absent features, and enjoy it while you wait. It will surely suffice in the interim, as I have found their technicians' skill level to be more than adequate and even surprisingly good, occasionally excellent, on most of the films they have released, especially when you factor in the low budget and similar levels of applied DNR. If you have a litter more money, and absolutely can't wait, I recommend that you go for one of the other available editions, one that uses a BD-50, rather than Mill Creek''s standard BD-25, and one which has been encoded at at least 25 mbps, rather than Mill Creek's standard 15 to 18.

Basically, if you can spare the money, I say go for it. I, not being well off, will wait the two months to one year for the Criterion release and Romero's personal restoration. I should point out that some insiders have hinted that it will actually be 2017 and not 2018 while others have said the opposite. Both are distinctly possible, as Janus may do the theatrical release for Halloween and then put the Criterion Blu-ray out for Christmas or they may do the theatrical for Halloween and wait until the next Halloween to release the Blu-ray, even though some of the fanfare will have died down. Given how many will have purchased the bare-bones print transfer from Mill Creek by Halloween 2018, not being able to wait, and how many of those will have realized that, now, they aren't really in such a hurry to get the spectacular Criterion release, it is entirely possible that Janus will rush to get their release out by this Halloween, on Blu-ray, via the beautiful Criterion label we all love so much.

For the record, and for anyone who cares, Mill Creek is not a bad company, in fact I am pretty much in love with Mill Creek and purchase nearly everything that they release. There is always a place for a good budget label putting out HD transfers on BD-25s at 15 mbps in good old AVC. However, this release is not even in the best aspect ratio currently available, unless they found a print that was uncropped, which is unlikely. This is what you buy if you have a terrible DVD and can upgrade for $3. If you love this film and can't wait, I still say get the Millennium DVD others have written about and await the magic of a Criterion release or, if you can wait, simply delay gratification and wait for the Romero restoration to be finalized by Janus and released by Criterion. Criterion takes a while to get off their collective you-know-whats and release something we all actually want to see, but, every few months, they manage to do it. The Philadelphia Story is finally being released this fall.

Good luck making your choice.",1503532800,127,7586,4.65646004480956

It got only a limited release and late nite showings to keep kids out.

471428,5,6302484367,"There are SPOILERS in this review. Seeing Night of the Living Dead with only four stars is a bit of a surprise to me because it is such an influential and important film in many ways. But it's also true that in terms of what has happened since its release long ago in 1968, that it seems tame and its relative cheapness shows through in a way that would leave viewers who did not experience its initial release wondering what all the fuss is about. But Night of the Living Dead was one of the most revolutionary films ever made and completely changed the horror genre and even influenced other types of films.

Every genre, whether of film, music or literature, has it's tropes, its cliches, the rules under which it operates. What Night of the Living Dead did was to overthrow and subvert almost all of the rules of the horror film as well as add new elements. Romero and Russo did not set out to make a revolutionary film; they were just bored with their Latent Image Company making local television ads and wanted to do something different. They just made the film by instinct, but by being apart from the film making world they were less aware of its rules and aware somehow that times had changed.

Horror in the 1960's was dominated by Hammer Films based in Britain and Roger Corman's American International. They both did about the same thing. Their films were made cheaply, often using the same sets in a number of films. They were filmed in lurid color and were basically Gothic dramas, thrillers and mysteries which often implied the supernatural but which usually turned out to be a front for a murderer or someone trying to drive someone else mad (for an inheritance). They did some pretty fun things this way and gave the world Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and the late career of Vincent Price. Some of their films were quite stylish, especially Corman's Poe dramas and some Hammer titles like The Wicker Man. But even when they included Frankenstein or Dracula they were never really scary. Of course there were a few independent masterpieces in the decade like Hitchcock's Psycho and The Birds and films like The Innocents, The Haunting and Rosemary's Baby but these were few and far between.

What you sat through was about 80 minutes of a semi-boring, often campy drama usually set in an isolated castle or manor somewhere, until the last ten minutes when the entire special effects budget would be used to show ghosts, magic, vampires or whatever. Night of the Living Dead turned all this on its head from the start. What was the last ten minutes in any other horror film started within the first ten minutes of this one, with Barbara being attacked and trying to flee, and it never let up for a minute after that. It completely blew up the old structure of horror films. The setting was an ordinary cemetery and a farmhouse - nothing special about that, but that was the point. Previous horror most often had been set in some exotic locale: a mansion, haunted house, castle, remote tropical island, etc. all ""other"" kinds of places where such things could happen. Here was horror set in your own backyard, implying it could happen to you. Hitchcock had done this with The Birds, and Spielberg would use the idea of setting the extraordinary in an everyday setting, but that was yet to come.

Already you were off balance. Then there are the monsters themselves; ghouls, later to be known as zombies, who were the reanimated dead and not only that but they wanted to eat your flesh. This was a whole new monster. It was like a blind force, unable to think but totally relentless and seemingly unstoppable in numbers. These were not mad scientists, elegant vampires or serial killers that you just might be able to reason with or trick; these just came at you. Then there was the gore. I know, it doesn't look like much now but in its day it was the extreme of gore. Snobbish critics called it junk. The editors of Variety were so upset they called it pornographic and called on the Supreme Court to set limits. (there was no MPAA rating system yet).

There were other unusual elements as well. The fact that the hero was a black man was highly unusual, though somehow I didn't notice that as much as the fact that he seemed to be the only sane, centered person there. Still, in many places that must have not gone down well, especially when he punches the cowardly Harry, who was white. Then there are Tom and Judy, two nice local kids, a jock and his attractive girlfriend. If anybody makes it out it will be them, right? That's the way any standard film would play. But when they die, that's the real turning point of the film. Now the world is turned upside down. Now you don't know what's going to happen. This film has no moral center, the fundament has opened up beneath your feet: anything can happen now. And it does. In the chaos that ensues only Ben is left, taking refuge in the very death trap basement he had (with good reason) scorned before. Then the film lulls you a bit with the sheriff and the locals acting almost comically until they see ""something"" moving in the farm house. They shoot Ben. The chaos is complete. In this disordered world even the hero of a thousand faces die. The universe is totally nihilistic.

The small budget worked for the film. The black and white stock made it seem more, not less real, and gave it a kind of documentary feel. The local actors often improvised their lines giving it even more of a cinema verite sense. Even the cheap stock music from older films rented from Capitol Records (they couldn't afford a composer) gave it an appropriately gritty feeling. In the end, even the mistake that caused it to not be copyrighted worked in the film's favor. It's true it was a cult hit, as big in Europe as in the U.S. and Romero lost a lot of potential money. But falling into public domain gave it an afterlife it likely would never have had otherwise, much like It's a Wonderful Life. Being free, it got played on thousands of TV station's Saturday Horror Night shows, Halloween shows making it familiar to just about everyone. Videos were put out by every conceivable company, often terrible-looking, but again, it was everywhere. This is what made it a mass phenomenon for so long.

We can thank Romero for sticking to his guns. Columbia Pictures and American International were both open to distributing it as long as he cut the gory scenes and re-shot a happy ending. What kind of movie would that have been?

PERSONAL NOTE: I first saw Night of the Living Dead under almost ideal circumstances. Everyone was back in Ohio on summer break in 1969 and a friend from NYU said we had to see this film, he hadn't, but everybody had been talking about it there. (Remember, movies weren't released everywhere at once then). When I heard the title I laughed, ""A zombie film? Those aren't scary, they just walk around like sleepwalkers.""  Another friend and I said Okay reluctantly, and we planned to make jokes and wisecrack throughout the film. The only place showing it was a drive-in way out in the country. It was surrounded by acres of corn fields as far as you could see. It was a lonely an almost spooky setting; it seemed like anything could walk out from the rows of corn. NOTLD was the second feature. I don't even remember the first. Once it came on and Barbara was attacked the car was total silence. Afterward we skipped the third feature and went home stunned.",1500768000,8,7442,4.581081081081081

471437,3,6302484367,"I've always been a fan of the original Dawn of the Dead and this movie comes in second as my favorite Romero horror film, however here I'm talking about the original version. This ""30th Anniversary"" is essentially a modern fan edit sold by some of the people behind the original and should not be confused with the original classic (or any of the color remakes or sequels out there).

Way back in the day when DVDs were still a relative novelty for cinephiles like myself, this DVD was released. I flipped over the back and noticed there was something about new footage. The movie-viewing public was still quaking in the shadow of George Lucas' highly successful ""Special Edition"" Star Wars re-release trilogy, so it seemed several other movies were coming out with ""newly re-edited"" special effects and the like, so it seemed somewhat natural for something like this to exist. I presumed the original movie was also in this collection and so it would be the definitive version of what I knew was otherwise a ""free"" film from the public domain.

The trouble is, the new stuff is pretty bad. So, apparently George A. Romero, the main man behind the original Night of the Living Dead had nothing to do with this release, and it seems the other production people who had co-created it back with him in the 60's and some of their family and friends (those that speak come across like community players) put this together and tried to make a version they could call their own. They dug out the old cameras and tried to create extra footage that looked like it was filmed in the same time and place, even locating the (much older) original actor who played the ""cemetery zombie"" who attacks Barbara. Once the novelty of this new footage wears off, what we are left with is essentially the same horror classic we all remember, but with a few of these other things tossed in every so often.

Once watching, the new soundtrack (which is mostly slightly depressing and repetitive but not completely out of place piano work) isn't much of a distraction. Much like the special editions of the Star Wars trilogy bemoaned by so many fans, after awhile you can ignore the jarring changes and just enjoy the movie underneath but you may (especially if you're a purist) find yourself wishing for a better version. I later located the ""red"" DVD that was endorsed by George Romero himself and depicts a gray tombstone on a red background cover, which is just what I asked for in the first place, the original film in good quality (and some nostalgic extras). This 30th anniversary DVD is like an experiment, and the supplemental material is pretty much how they made it. There is a second version of the film included on the disc which is just the original cut of the film with the new soundtrack pasted over. The ""second disc"" is just an audio CD of the new piano soundtrack.

So what's ""new""? SPOILERS:

Now we see the ""origin"" of the cemetery zombie. Some day laborers carry the coffin of a dead man (executed for raping and murdering a little girl) to the cemetery where the girl's angry parents await. The guys talk about going to flirt with a woman they are both attracted to at Beakman's Diner (mentioned elsewhere in the original film).

Accompanying the parents (the father spits on the face of the dead man and storms off) is a clerically dressed priest who bears a striking resemblance to 1960's cult leader Anton Levay (if memory serves this is actually the man who created the new music for this edit as well). The acting in these scenes may call to mind memories of Ed Wood, and may have been intentional that way. The workers mention that the corpse's brain was ""fried"" by the electric chair. Left alone with the two workers who are supposed to dig the grave, the corpse comes to life and starts staggering off just like he did 30 years ago. Then we cut to the regular movie as we remember it.

I noticed a few extra changes in the soundtrack, whereas before we start to tune out the ""radio broadcast"" this time that dialogue is repeated throughout instead of being drowned out by the library soundtrack of the original while inside the farmhouse.

There is a later cut to the scene of ""Beakman's Diner"" where a crowd of zombies surround a crashed car. The earlier dialogue had described a tanker truck, but this is a ""family car"" with the driver a nearly decapitated corpse and the family getting up out of the car and joining the zombie mob marching in the direction of the farmhouse. Prominent among the new zombies is a woman dressed like a waitress with one arm missing (and obviously tucked behind her in the outfit) who if memory serves was the daughter of one of the producers of this edit.

Eventually we get scenes of these zombies joining in the mayhem later, and finally we are treated to the ""shocking"" new ending (in addition to the old shocking enough ending). The priest is attacked by one of the zombies and bitten on the face. But he survives... apparently the bite was not deep enough. A reporter interviews him and in one of the more cliched scenes, the minister starts spouting off on some kind of quasi-messianic theory that he's been chosen to beat the zombies by ""spiking"" (nailling them to the ground so they can't rise again, I guess similar to the old vampire cure) and the reporter walks off confused.

This is the type of edit you may see once out of curiosity (like the ""colorized"" versions) and then never again. I've seen it twice, and I prefer the original version of the film (available elsewhere and more worth your time). Skip this and look for them instead.",1492992000,2,5590,4.609045226130653

471546,3,6302484367,"Night of the Living Dead, 1968 film

""They're coming to get you, Barbara"" starts this movie. They drive to a cemetery to visit their Mother's grave. An old man walks toward them, then another man attacks Barbara, who defends herself. Strange men try to get in her car! She runs away screaming. She sees a farmhouse and runs toward it. Its front door is locked, nobody at home. Stuffed animal heads adorn the walls. Something falls from the second floor! A pickup truck arrives with a man wearing a suit. Any shotguns or rifles inside? The man pushes a zombie out the door. Barbara uses a steel rod against another zombie. [Is there an explanation for these anomalies? If its not nuclear tests then it could be Global Warming!] Can the zombies be stopped? Can you kill the dead? They must stay in the farmhouse until help arrives. [No telephone service?]

Night falls. They have electricity. The radio has ""trash talk"", people who talk as if they know something when they don't. Ben and Barbara take out the trash, then talk about what happened. Only a shot to the head will stop them. Ben finds ammunition, there must be guns in the house. Ben finds one (the previous owner has no need for it). They find other refugees in the house. The truck is out of gas, is there gas kept in the shed? Should they hide in the cellar? Ben says no. They learn what happened earlier. There are personal conflicts. Ben orders boards nailed over the glass windows for protection. Barbara sees more zombies approaching the house. The activities provide shocking surprises! The television tells of an emergency. Will Cooper cooperate? Can they work together? A zombie tries to break in, but is stopped. Barbara shows her marksmanship skills! She gets more bullets. Cooper hears the TV broadcast news.

What is causing people to act like that? What if the recently dead should come back to life? Is it a widespread virus? Judgment Day? There is more personal conflict inside. Can they find the truck keys? Yes, but they need gas for the truck. More zombies gather around the house, a flaming torch keeps them away. The gas pump explodes and the truck burns. No escape now. Ben fights his way back. Cooper fights with Barbara for the rifle! What happened to Sarah? Can Barbara get help? Zombies break on through to the inside! Is there no escape? What will happen when they run out of bullets? The morning brings help, armed men and a helicopter. The zombies are disposed of, then place on a huge pile. They find one in the cellar. Barbara gets the last one! She watches the burning pyre. What is she thinking now?

The original 1968 monochrome movie was a low budget production from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania that was a surprise hit in the spring of that year. It resonated with the audience somehow. This is a copy that has some changes from the original story. Was it better? The original was more restrained, perhaps due to the censorship of that era. The story didn't offer an explanation for its impossible premise. What happened in the other parts of the country, such as urban areas? Will they ever offer a third version? Not if there is no paying audience. Does this uprising symbolize the threat from the huge debts of the past? They can't be ended with a well-aimed rifle shot.

As they make their arrival, a thunderstorm starts to make its forbidding descent on the grounds and as lightning shreds the murky skys the par notices an ominous being walking in the distance.
Barbara gets anxious and wishes to leave, Johnny sees an opportunity to put a good fright into his little sister by proclaiming that hes coming to get her, harmless fun, meanwhile turns gravely serious as the strangers in fact attacks Barbara and kills Johnny as he tries to intertwine.
With the stranger lumbering in pursuit, Barbara flees out over the desolated plains in desperate search for a place to hide, when she spots a secluded farmhouse in the distance, she immediately seeks shelter there and inturn finds that the house is seemingly abandoned.
As the stranger lurks outside Barbara tries to regain her composure, as she checks the house for its residences
But when she ventures upstairs she stumbles across a partially eaten body, which sends her panic stricken towards the front door, there she finds herself face to face with Ben, who grabs her and drags her back inside the house.
Ben tries to explain his situation, that he was attack by a group of strangers at the nearby Beckmanns Dinner and barely managed to escape the situation. He subsequently tries to probes Barbara for her story, but the stress and traumatic events of the day is starting to take there toll on the young women and when she lashes out at him in a fit of hysterics he inturn knocks her out.
As the night continues and an increasing number of strangers surround the house, Ben starts to barricade the doors and windows of the old farmhouse while listing to the increasingly alarming radio reports of violence perpetrated by people in a trancelike state all over America.
But just as things are claming down, a grope of survivors emerge from the cellar, to check out if the upstairs is safe, which inturn presents a whole new set of problems in the form of an escalating power struggle between Ben and the refugees supposed leader Harry Copper
As the night grows even darker so does the prospects of survival as difference of opinion and general latent hostility threatens to tear the group apart, more and more this place of sanctuary is ultimately starting to looks less like a safe haven and more like an tomb. As the remaining media outlet realise that these rabid attackers are in fact the living dead and militia groups consisting mostly of gun crazy rednecks, are forming all over the US to eradicate this unusual threat, self-preservation eventual consumes the group as the houses power supply shuts down triggers the zombie inevitable attack on the sheltering farmhouse.

Night of the Living Dead was produced in a particular tumultuous time in American history. The Cold War, the Kennedy brothers assassination, the comeback of Richard M. Nixon combined with the seemingly neverending war in South East Asia and escalating race riots all gave fuel to one of the most poignant slices of discouraging nihilistic cinema outputs ever, brilliantly masqueraded as crowd pleasing entertainment. On the surface a harmless fright flick about flesh munching zombies, upon closer inspection however, a heart rendering socio-political allegory with unlimited bite and brains. And furthermore one of the best films of the sixtiesHell, ever!

Night of the Living dead is the patriarch of seminal horror films Sam Raimi, Tope Hooper and john Landis have all named the film as a primary influence on their subsequent works and its fair to say that this film created The Zombie (although that idiom is never utilized) as we have come to know and love it today, although Victor Halperins White Zombie (1933) did get there first, and while its an accomplished slave allegory and immensely important in its own right it is ultimately an entirely different beast altogether.
These Moderne day flesh munches are holistically the creation of George A. Romero and his insistence on incorporating social commentary while changing the rules of the game makes him stand out and worth commemorating .

I remember my first encounter with the film vividly; it was during the summer vacation of 1993, the Danish television station TV-2 showed it late one night long past the witching hour and having waited all week to catch it I anxiously sat down to indulges on this horror classic An hour and a half later I was a changed person.
Completely captivated by the stunning Back and white photography by Romero himself, the incredible effectiveness of an obvious minuscule budget and the overpowering sense of atmosphere that it projected, I was left breathless and in awe at the capability of low-budget filmmaking, so much so that I subsequently scattered the VHS marked to acquire the remaining parts of what I would eventually learn was an absolutely transcendent trilogy of films, namely the majestic and epic Dawn of The Dead (1978) and the utterly nihilistic Day of the Dead (1985).

In the aftermath of the films initial release in 68 Night of the Living Dead gained notoriety for its ne plus ultra depiction of gore and while its still true that the graphic content is severe in its presentation and certainly very much ahead of its time, its not very likely to churn stomachs in this day and age.
What remains undiminished however is the films ability to chill an audience with its cold visuals and haunting score, weaving a tapestry, unblemished in its portrayal of hell on earth.
In a world compromised by demagogic values and the promise of completion obtained through material grains, this film stands as a radiant beacon in the candid hopelessness that is the 21th century inevitable decline, in that it tests you and asks do you want to just sit idly by and let the sense of apathy consume you ? Or do you want to get in touch with your humanity, however utopian that might seem.

Youd do well to bypass the 30th anniversary edition that include dismal added footage and just go for the original classic. It has more releases the Sahara has grains of sand so the options are plentiful just make sure it the original !

Reviewed here is the beautiful 3 disc Japanese edition from DEX Entertainment which houses three keep cases in a sturdy box.
Disc one house the main feature presented in 4:3 remastered and completely scratch free. In the extras department you get two audio commentary tracks, the first one by George A. Romero, John Russo, Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman (the Latent Image Crew) and the second one by Bill Hinzman, Judith O Dea, Keith Wayne Kyra Schon Russell Streiner and Vince Survinski (Actors/Latent Image folk) both are chuck filled with anecdotes concerning the low budget and the challenges it presents and deserves to be heard by all aspiring filmmakers and people interested in genre films, both. Its a wonderful listening experience.
The second disc presents an immense photo gallery from the production of the film, a radio interview with Duane Jones (Ben) a great interview of Judith Ridley (Judy) conducted by Marilyn Burns (Helen Cooper) a house of commercial produced by Latent Image (check out the endorsement for Duke Beer its priceless!
Furthermore theres scenes from Romeros abandoned project Theres always vanilla
The third disc presents the film in colour, so I humble advice you be to skip that one entirely but if you are serious about Night of the Living Dead then this edition more then worth your while.",1435449600,,7537,4.898198903680501

Some of its exploits like how people react to crises and survival is borrowed for the Walking Dead. The movie also has an interesting take on human behavior where its basically every man for themselves.

Theres also some undertones about race as well with the black protagonist. Its also amazing how it was all done in black and white even though there was a option for color.

The ending is also pretty chilling even for this day and age. The director was asked to have a love interest in the movie but he declined. Thought it was to Hollywood and I like how the director George Romero did his own thing with this movie. Heres also a link where you can download and even burn it to a dvd-r if you can. Dont worry its public domain so you won't get in trouble.

471867,4,6302484367,"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is everything a horror movie should be. Black & White with classic horror movie muic.  Bleak with a terrifying concept, and completely devoid of humor. The movie is extremely well acted, especially considering the budget they had to work with. This leads to a very believable film. Romero and Russo came up believed they came up with the most terrifying idea (the dead eating the living), and they were right. The antagonists aren't made up creations like vampires or aliens. They're us. Every aspect adds up to the quintessential horror story.

One thing I would like to point out in particular is the AMAZING guerrilla-style camera work. Up to 1968, I don't recall ever seeing a film that made use of the camera angles in a way that truly conveyed a manic state throughout. This honestly was one of the most influential horror films ever made. Night of the Living Dead was the basis of five subsequent Living Dead films (19782010) also directed by Romero, and has inspired remakes.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you checkout ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooki) Svengoolie is a hosted horror movie show.  The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV.  To make it even better :Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOILER ALERT
Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny Blair (Russell Streiner) drive to rural Pennsylvania for an annual visit to their father's grave, at their mother's request. Noticing Barbra's discomfort, Johnny teases, ""They're coming to get you, Barbra"", before she is attacked by a strange man (Bill Hinzman). Johnny tries to rescue his sister, but breaks his neck on a gravestone, killing himself. Barbra flees by car but crashes into a tree. With the stranger in pursuit, she escapes on foot, and later arrives at a farmhouse where she discovers a woman's mangled corpse. Running out of the house, she is confronted by strange menacing figures like the man in the graveyard. Ben (Duane Jones) takes her into the house, where Barbra slowly descends into shock and insanity as Ben drives the monsters from the house and seals the doors and windows.

Ben and Barbra are unaware that the farmhouse has a cellar, housing an angry married couple Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman) and their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), who sought refuge after a group of zombies overturned their car; and teenage couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley), who arrived after hearing an emergency broadcast about a series of brutal murders. Karen has fallen seriously ill after being bitten by one of the zombies. They venture upstairs when Ben turns on a radio, while Barbra awakens from a stupor. Harry demands that everyone hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a ""deathtrap"" and continues, upstairs, to barricade the house, with Tom's help.

Radio reports explain that a state of mass murder is sweeping across the eastern United States. When Ben finds a television, the emergency broadcaster reports that the recently deceased have become reanimated and are consuming the flesh of the living. Experts, scientists, and the United States military fail to discover the cause, though one scientist suspects radioactive contamination from a space probe returning from Venus, which was deliberately exploded in the Earth's atmosphere when the radiation was detected.

 The Cooper family hiding in the cellar.
When the reports list local rescue centers offering refuge and safety, Ben plans to obtain medical care for Karen. Ben and Tom therefore refuel Ben's truck, while Harry hurls Molotov cocktails from an upper window at the ""undead"". Fearing for Tom's safety, Judy follows him. At the pump, Tom accidentally spills gasoline on the truck, setting it ablaze. Tom and Judy try to drive the truck away from the pump, but Judy is unable to free herself from its door, and the truck explodes, instantly killing Tom and Judy.

Ben returns to the house, but is locked out by Harry, and forces entry. Angered by Harry's cowardice, Ben beats him, while the undead feed on the remains of Tom and Judy. In the house, a news report reveals that, aside from setting the ""reactivated bodies"" on fire, only a gunshot or heavy blow to the head can stop them, and that posses of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.

Moments later, the lights go out and the living dead break through the barricades. Harry grabs Ben's rifle and threatens to shoot him, but Ben wrestles the gun away and fires. Mortally wounded, Harry stumbles into the cellar and collapses next to Karen, who has also died from her illness. The undead try to pull Helen and Barbra through the windows, but Helen frees herself and goes down into the cellar, to find a reanimated Karen eating Harry. Helen, paralyzed by shock, falls as Karen stabs her to death with a masonry trowel. Barbra, seeing Johnny among the living dead, is carried away by the horde and devoured. The undead overrun the house, and Ben seals himself inside the cellar (ironically, the course of action he originally argued against), where he finds Harry and Helen starting to reanimate and shoots them.

The next morning, Ben is awakened by the gunshots of sheriff's deputies killing all the zombies they find. Venturing upstairs, he is killed by a member of the posse. The film ends with a series of still shots as Ben is placed onto a burning pyre, along with other dead bodies.",1431820800,,5586,4.892177589852008

471871,4,6302484367,"Night of the Living Dead is the quintessential horror film. I saw it for the first time in 1997 when I was in my mid-20s on a VHS tape (I think it was the 30th anniversary edition). I recently purchased the Blu-ray format. Since it has been a long time I really cannot tell whether there are any major differences between the two versions. The picture looks better however a few scenes have blemishes (noticeable vertical lines) and crackling noise on the audio, again some scenes are grainy like VHS tape. These are not throughout the film but only in certain scenes. I wonder if they could have done a better job with cleaning up these artifacts, that is if they have done any cleanup at all. Other than that, my biggest disappointment was the lack of subtitles and bonus material (the only special feature is the original trailer).

As for the film itself, like I said it is the quintessential horror film. I cannot think of a better film that can represent the genre. It is relentless. It is high tension. It was made on a very low budget but still very effective. It is a testament to the fact that you don't need BIG budget or CGI effects to create an atmosphere. In that regard, I think the movie was directed masterfully. The soundtrack was very effective and added suspense to the movie which was already suspenseful. This movie has spawned numerous sequels, remakes and imitations but it stands out to be better than all of them. I highly recommend this to any horror fan.",1430784000,5,1482,4.550561797752809

The menu screen also has no animation, but most the extras are good and they're plentiful. An interesting extra allows you to read the entire original script which is quite long, and you can also read about some of other ideas that they were thinking of which lead to NOTLD being created. An interesting idea that they had involved a boy who runs away from home, only to find corpses underneath panes of glass during an accident that happens to him. The corpses are there to properly decompose to eat for these creatures like ghouls. They never finished the script, and you just read about the idea. I don't know why Romero never made this film because it sounds like a creative idea that probably would've made a good profit. That ""Night of the Living Bread"" short runs around 8 minutes, the Jones interview about 16 min., and the Judith interview around 10 minutes. That ""Night of the Living Bread"" is just a silly B&W short about killer pieces of bread, but it'll obviously have interest to those like myself who are fans of NOTLD. The other extras on the disc will also be of interest to some. There's an extra that has some stuff about the Hardman Eastman studios. It shows some outtakes from a quick B&W short called ""The Derelict."" It also has some other stuff about the studios, but none of this stuff is really interesting. However, fans of Romero might like some of the stuff with THERE'S ALWAYS VANILLA if they haven't seen the film. The quality on this version of NOTLD is excellent, but I'm thinking about getting the Japanese Blu-ray of the film to replace this DVD because it doesn't look like it's going to be released anytime soon over here on Blu-ray; In fact, it may never get released on Blu-ray over here.",1429142400,,1864,4.6006006006006

471992,5,6302484367,"This has been my favorite movie since I first saw it when I was 6 years old. It gave me horrible nightmares that night and I've loved it ever since. Since then, I've probably watched it about 200 times at least (it's my go-to movie when I need something to watch in bed at night). Yes I'm from Pittsburgh but that is truly just strange and awesome coincidence.

It is everything a horror movie should be. Bleak with a terrifying concept, and completely devoid of humor. Not to mention that it DEFINED what the concept of what a zombie IS that's continued on until present day. Now how many horror movies can you say have done that? With the exceptions of ""Return of the Living Dead"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"", I believe that zombie comedies are every bit as revolting as romantic comedies.

The movie is extremely well acted, especially considering the budget they had to work with. This leads to a very believable film. Yes, there's a lot of ""down time"" with Tarantino-esque amounts of dialogue but this is how the tension builds to the climactic ending. Romero and Russo believed they came up with the most terrifying idea (the dead eating the living), and they were right. The antagonists aren't made up creations like vampires or aliens. They're us.

One thing I would like to point out in particular is the AMAZING guerrilla-style camera work. Up to 1968, I don't recall ever seeing a film that made use of the camera angles in a way that truly conveyed a manic state throughout. And the make up effects... They may seem cheap, but the fact that the dead look human is what makes the fear stick. They don't have the chimpanzee-like bulging cheek bones and forehead al the late 70s/80s zombies; they're not overdone in an attempt to make them look more monstrous... They look like people, lifeless unfeeling people. After all, when we fear strangers, what we fear is that they intend to do us harm without emotion or willingness to reason.

This honestly was one of the most influential horror films ever made. It was also one of the first film to be adopted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. My favorite recollection being Roger Ebert, at the premier, remembering seeing a little girl around 8 in the theater aisle crying in terror during ""dinner"" scene after Tom and Judy are killed... Many people had brought their kids, having no idea what they were in for. Up until this film, no horror flicks were so unabashedly and unapologetically brutal in their content.

Altogether, a total work of art. There will never be anything else like it.",1410566400,3,2569,4.649779735682819

This is the film I remembered seeing eons ago, and loving.  Filmed in stark black and white, forlorn deserted roads, a cemetery out in the middle of nowhere.  Eerie.  Fabulous.  The perfect spot for a gathering.  When things go wrong they stay wrong.  The story is unrelenting, raw, and emotional.  Love how the zombies are shot half seen, in and out of darkness, saving just a few for close-ups.  There's also a terrific score of ambient music and creepy sound effects.  It reminds me of 50s sci-fi flicks.  A lot of the dialog was ad-libbed.  My favorite monologue was when Barbra (Judith O'Dea) gave her account of what happened in the cemetery with her brother, reinterpreting it to put herself in a better light (according to Judith, it was shot in one take, she ad-libbed the entire scene).

This is supposedly an unashamed rip-off of Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend that the author didn't appreciate, calling it ""kind of cornball.""

Romero was in deed a genious before Mr. King stepped in (AND STILL IS...I'm not saying he isnt). I would have watched Night of the living dead when I was 11, but I could never stay focused while watching the film. The B&W picturing was just too blurry and confusing for me to watched when I watched the first 20 minutes on YouTube, so I waited, hoping that they would come out with one with ALL original film, nothing added, taken, or remade. After 5 years of waiting, I thought it would never happen, so I thought that if I couldn't see the original film in color, I'd get the next best thing. That is the version of this NOTLD, remastered and all original. It was not scary, but it was not terrible. To think that this was pretty much the beginning to a new era of warefare, betral, and different scenario's of a specie that would take the world by storm (or at least Pennsylvania). The Black fella NOT being (one of) the first person to die, a child zombie that kills her own parents, which we all have to admit it isn't really seen too often (and to think that was 45 Years Ago!), and some others details that made the film great.

I will say for the record that the film was not scary, at least in this day in age, but I never saw it back then, so I will never know why people think it is, but I know it is a timeless classic that will never be unappreciated. I give it a 4 out of 5 for being innovative, original, and cool by horror standards, but I'll never know why people think its scary, even though I know it was because I never saw it that long ago.

 Personally i'm a die hard fan of NOTLD 1968 and i have it in all available dvd editions just to have the different cover and extras.
 So this new version was a welcome addition and it didn't butchered anything.
 I mean....we saw the original movie so many times that we know it upside down the music the score the scenes.....everything.
 I was glad they added new scenes so that we got smg different with new music score and scenes but most of the movie remained the same so u don't miss the old feeling of the movie.
 I will agree the final scene with the priest was useless but not the opening scene.
 As russo said that scene was perfectly matched with the original opening of the 1968 film.
 I also liked the new score although the older score was more creepy for sure.
 Anyways....i'm glad we now have 3 different versions of the original so that we can expand our NOTLD horizons.
 We have the first and best 1968 version.
 then we have this 1998 30th anniv. edition with 15 minutes of new scenes and new score.
 And also we got the great 1990 savini remake which is great in it's own right.
 So stop moaning and enjoy the 30th anniv. edition for what it is.
 this dvd is the best. it's the limited edition (15,000 copies and i have #707) which has a great picture of the 30th anniv. edition.
 It also has the original 1968 version included but with a different music score and most of all it has extras and an exclusice cd soundtrack with all new 60 tracks with new 1998 music score and dialogs from the movie.
 If u want my opinion here are the best 5 dvd versions for you to buy the romero original zombie trilogy.

 1) NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 1968 (40TH ANNIV. EDITION...It contains the 1968 original version and the great documentary ""another one for the fire"" which has everything u need about NOTLD)
 2) NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 1998 (3OTH ANNIV. LIMITED EDITION...This dvd has the 1998 anniv. edition with new footage and the esclusive music score O.S.T plus the 1968 version)
 3) NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 1990 (A Great remake. the savini's re-imagining of the classic 1968 film full of extras including the dead walk docum. almost equal to the original)
 4) DAWN OF THE DEAD (THE ULTIMATE EDITION...4 dvd's with all available versions, director's cut, argento cut, theatrical cut plus many extras, documentarys)
 5) DAY OF THE DEAD (SPECIAL DIVIMAX EDITION...2 dvd's with many extras and the best picture and sound of the movie currently available)",1382140800,,2556,4.537117903930131

It's certainly a classic for horror lovers. This movie is the among the first of the ""respectable"" horror/zombie flicks, and as such if you don't see it you'll constantly be missing references and homage from many other movies. If you haven't seen it you're missing references in Alien, Cujo, The Supernaturals, Beetlejuice, Shaun of the Dead, 28 Days Later, and so many more.

But it's a must see for lovers of almost all other types of movies as well. This movie didn't depend on gore or cheap scares; the chocolate syrup they had simulating blood wasn't that impressive, and while you might tense up while watching it, you'll almost never jump.

The real genius of it is in the frightened group of people stranded in the farmhouse, trying to cope with the new reality they're seeing around them. You see people traumatized, people in shock, people scared and desperate and angry and struggling to regain some semblance of control over their lives as their world falls apart around them.

If you call yourself a horror fan, than you've already seen this milestone picture. If you're a horror fan in training, then you need to see this milestone picture! Shocking, intensely creepy, & a feeling of hopelessness fill this film! In the year 1968, nothing came close to being as mind blowing as this film, other than that other titan of horror films, ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which was an intimate tale of horror, made all the more potent by people you love & trust not being who you think they are. While Romero's, ""Night of The Living Dead"" was horror on a huge scale, & those who you thought you knew, are dead, & want to eat you. It's a choice of them or you, all old feelings put aside for survival.

This film features still one of the most potent scenes in horror, as a child kills & starts to devour her mother. Children offing their parent(s) was nothing new, but eating them, & watching the act of it being done on screen was a huge leap in terror! The horror movie genre grown up, vicious & ready to bite the horror fan right in the human psyche!

Yes, ""Night Of The Living Dead"" was a true milestone, & still packs a bite! It has spawned maybe more horror films than any other horror film, great, good, & unfortunately, mediocre to very bad in impressive Zombie like apocalyptic numbers. It has been over analyzed to the point of nausea, by it's legion of fans, along with other Romero films. Made on a hamburger budget, this film is impressive indeed, if not the holy evil bible of analogies it's loyal fanboys & girls would like to make it out to be. It is a text book study in horror, dread, suspense, loneliness, & most of all, hopelessness. It does have an early & very good theme of anti racism streaked through it, with it's strong black lead. It clumsily portrays that every rural person is a bloodthirsty racist redneck, that shoots for the plain thrill of it, & yes, I can see that happing, but with all people, from all backgrounds. Romero heavy handedly drives home his prejudice or naivet's of people who live in the country, with happy twitching trigger fingers ready to shoot, then throw a BBQ with gallons of beer. Hard times bring out hardness in all people, & Romero faltered here. Otherwise, this is a essential horror film. Essential for any horror fan, or for that matter, movie buff, to see what movies are stepping stones to the next level of their genre, & ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is such a huge stepping stone, that one needs an elevator to get to the next step!",1370736000,,2526,4.4514038876889845

If your copy has liner notes it probably is authentic.

There's a reason it's being sold for only $4.95.

By the way, the Millenium Edition is a version of Night of the Living Dead that looks and sounds fantastic. George Romero himself gave his blessing and approval of the remastering.

472197,3,6302484367,"I am not familiar with the horror genre beyond the relative handful of the type which I saw as a pre-tv kid. Reading the background of this one, I see it is considered a seminal film in which many significant ones have their roots. I viewed it simply as something for entertainment today and base my judgment only on the version listed for this webpage; there can be and are many versions, since the producer failed to copyright the original and its fair game for anyone.
Viewed today, without reference to its historic role, it is a crudely made B picture of its time, black and white, made on an infinitesimal budget and showing it. It is watchable but not striking in its imagery. The acting is just about minimally acceptable, although the lead shows promise. The sets are as simple as can be, the living dead appear like a group of bathers on the way from the Coney Island boardwalk to the  beach, the plotting wholly simplistic. With the exception of  a brief scene showing the barely visible eating of human flesh (mostly well masked), there is little that has not been seen time and again before.
If one is interested in film history, that would change the nature of the film to the viewer and make it  a more fruitful experience, since one sees the roots of many contemporary  films and tv series.

472250,4,6302484367,"Night of the Living Dead is a good movie; it's a movie that has a simple plot, and because of that, one isn't lost at any time. Would I consider this film one of the scariest of all time? Not even close. At no time during this film was I scared or on the edge of my seat. This effect isn't exactly necessary, but certainly helps when the viewer is intrigued by the visuals or suspense. Of course, this movie came out in 1968, so the envelope was actually pushed for that time period. I take all of this into consideration when reviewing an older movie. However, at face value, the movie seems to drag at certain times, and gets somewhat boring. An example of this is the repetition with arguing amongst the trapped people. Too much time is spent reinforcing the tension between these people. It gets to the point of slowing down the film and creating frustration. The brightest parts of this film are the zombies, with their awkward movements and relentless pursuit of humans. The graphic violence must have been a stunner back in the day, with gory stuff that would even be a tad controversial today. And a nude woman zombie? Throw that in for good measure, and what you've got is a pretty good horror film that taps the senses and delivers on plot, concept, and tension. One last thought: this movie doesn't have darkness to it. One could argue that it really does have darkness, that being mental and psychological. Visually, it's inferior in this area. Still, I recommend this film for horror genre lovers.",1358294400,,1510,4.575645756457565

It's really as scary.

Within two minutes of turning the movie on, I had to turn it off for a few minutes to collect myself. I wasn't sure I could turn it back on. But eventually, my breathing evened back out and I was able to start it back up.

While some of the acting is a bit cheesy, and you can hear the canned sound from the studio voiceovers, it still manages to be one of the scariest movies I've ever watched. It is an amazing ""what-if"" scenario, which is one of the reasons I find it so horrifying. It had an ""aw, man!"" ending; but given the circumstances of the storyline, it was predictable and understandable.

One of the few native US releases (actually the only one that I know of), the picture is crystal clear. The source print is pristine, and the menu even looks great, with the stylized title and a zombie hand that reaches up for your menu selection. No extras (aside from a slideshow of stills), but the movie is what counts, and it looks amazing here. This print has slight cropping, but noticeably less than the Optimum transfer used for many of the other foreign releases. Very little of the complete film was edited out of this print, less than 30 seconds of arguably unimportant dialog. Given that there is hardly an ""official/definitive"" cut of the film, slight edits in different prints is common and practically unnoticeable.

The lack of extras is really the only strike against the disc here, but the Weinstein Company, who released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/40th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0013D8LAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">40th Anniversary Edition</a>&nbsp;on DVD several years ago, has all the good stuff copyrighted, I'm sure. It has such extras as the ""One for the Fire"" documentary, Romero audio commentary, etc. Since Romero hasn't decided to release his own Blu-ray version with those copyrighted (or new) extras included, the public domain film itself is really all that legitimate 3rd party Blu-ray distributors, like Forgotten Films, can legally offer, I would assume.

There are only a couple other Region A/Region Free releases that will work in region-locked US Blu-ray players, and from what I've uncovered via researching these releases and watching this one myself, this Forgotten Films version strikes the right balance of US availability/compatibility, fullest picture, cleanest print, and lack of edits (plus a reasonable price).

472321,4,6302484367,"While zombie pictures had been around for a while, George A. Romero changed things forever in 1968 with this classic horror film.  Produced on a shoestring budget with unknown actors, he brought a new gory, visceral texture to the genre.  The movie opens with a brother and sister travelling from the city to rural Pennsylvania to place flowers on their father's grave.  A lumbering man with dead eyes approaches and the fun begins.

As her brother is killed, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) manages to escape to a farm house.  Shortly a man drives up in a pick-up truck.  Ben (Duane Jones) is also looking for safety.  He manages to board up the house using tools and wood found inside the house.  Barbara goes insane after her confrontation earlier which isn't helped when she finds a partially eaten housewife upstairs.  They are then joined by a couple and their young...and bitten...daughter along with another young couple.  They had taken refuge in the cellar but finally emerge after hearing a radio.

All the performances are, well, terrible with the exception of Jones as the hero.  Although his race is never mentioned in the film, it was controversial at the time.  Here is this good looking black guy saving the ass of the white whiners.  Pretty ballsy casting by Romero.  The zombies in this early film, unlike some of the more modern epics, are slow, clumsy, stupid and easily killed, ""kill the brain, you kill the ghoul"" (they are never called zombies).  Even though it is cheaply made, there is a certain legitimate dread watching it.  And if you saw it in 1968, you remembered it for a long time.  Still it really isn't very good; but it is a game changing horror classic and certainly worth watching.

There are numerous video versions of the same film and some are pretty bad transfers.  I saw this on ""Millennium Edition"" DVD which is THX certified and produced by Elite Entertainment.  The film looks good in its original black and white and 1:33:1 aspect ratio.  You have a choice of original mono or Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.",1325721600,2,2042,4.7578347578347575

I prefer the black and white version cause thats what it originally came out as. I remember buying this film at Barnes and Noble and I really was impressed by what I saw the zombies were so believable. Overall for  the tight budget this film was made on it is pretty good although I wish that the film had some special features and it had more zombie action but this movie is a classic in every way imaginable like ALfred Hitchcock's Psycho film and in my opionion scarier and better. I thought it was really corny and dumb when the kid zombie killed her mother with a tool I mean zombies  aren't soppused too use tools everybody knows that. They eat you and then you become a zombie. I found the music too be good in this film. This isn't a perfect film but its still pretty good. My favorite part would have to be when the zombies enter the house that the people are hiding in and its pure cauos. This movie will always be a classic unforgettable in every way corny at some parts but  overall a pretty decent film one every horror aficionado should add too there collection. The gore in this film was really good I thought it was believable. This movie is one of the best of the geaorge Romero's dead series. I think that every horror buff should watch this film at least once and you won't be dissapointed trust me. I wish that there was a special edition of this film but alas there isn't that im aware of but still worth a buy.

  THis is the type of movie that after watching a million times you will want too keep coming back and watch it again and again. The secret too making  people think something like this could happen is too set it in the real world and Romero has definetely done that here with this good picture. Zombies have been around in horror films for a long time and there not going away anytime soon so praise to Romero for helping define the zombie Genre of Horror films he didn't invent it but if you ask me he sure helped perfect it.

It does have a 2.0 Stereo soundtrack, which is slightly better than a Mono track. There is even a large slideshow of images from the movie.

The only major downside I can see with this release is the lousy artwork used for the case. It just has a screengrab of one of the random zombies from the movie with a block and some text around it. The image is fairly sharp on the printed-out artwork, which wasn't cut out straight, but it's just not an image I would've chosen myself.

472326,4,6302484367,"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD

While the zombie has had a place in film since the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, it was with George Romero's Night of the Living Dead that the modern zombie was born.  Prior to Romero's conception, zombies tended to be dead or half-dead beings under the control of some magician, who through spells and potions kept his zombies animated.  Romero gave birth to a new zombie, and probably the one we most think of when we hear the word, zombie.  Although the idea of this new zombie was taken from The Last Man on Earth, Romero makes it uniquely his own.

It's a simple story, but one with many complexities buried beneath the surface.  A small group of people is driven to seek sanctuary at an abandoned farmhouse from hordes of homicidal creatures, ie, the zombies.  They barricade the house as best they can to keep the zombies out, but soon enough tensions grow between two of the living.  Ben is the cool headed, pragmatic thinker who tries to do what is best for the group, a sort of utilitarian compared to his antagonist Harry, who is panicked by the situation and very combative towards the rest of the group.  It's sort of a look at the dynamics of a survivalist situation.  To live through this zombie attack, they must work together, but it is impossible for them to agree on a coarse of action.

The zombies themselves deserve some attention.  They are some of the creepiest monsters to ever see the screen, which is a testament to Romero's expertise as director considering the miniscule budget he was working with.  Essentially, the zombies are just extras painted up with a little makeup and told to fumble around and look dazed all the time, but their movements, coupled with dark lighting and ghoulish sound effects make it work.  The real break from the old style zombie is in that these living dead are not as slow--either in body or mind--as their predecessors.  In fact, when the smell of flesh is close by, these things can move, and they have a relentless drive to kill that isn't abated except with termination.  Rather than using magic to animate the zombies, these are brought to life by radiation from outer space.  The concept is all recently dead bodies are brought back to life by this radiation, only with an overwhelming desire to kill, and this means that the zombies are a plague rather than a random occurrence.

The cinematography is outstanding.  To compensate for the low budget, Romero uses a variety of great camera techniques to make the film interesting.  He uses lots of strange angles during the attacks, as well as close-ups during times of stress, all to great benefit.  The lighting however, makes the film.  Much of it is shot in darkness, shadows fall everywhere, and the lack of light makes the zombies look scary, establishes a dark mood, and creates a sensation of disarray and confusion.  The sound effects are great, too.

The way it was shot makes the movie feel like a documentary at times, and I think this is an interesting touch.  When you break it down, all the camera is doing is following the action of the movie as it unfolds in real time.  It doesn't feel like anybody is acting, and the use radio and television broadcasts add an air of authenticity.  Prior to these broadcasts, the characters know about as much as we do, and the movie uses these news reports to establish what is happening and why.

All of Romero's films are riddled with social commentary, and this one is no exception.  It is up to the viewer to decipher all these messages for themselves, but you will recognize a few themes.  I think the ideas of authority and trust are explored pretty strongly, as it is which NASA spreads the radiation and the government immediately goes to work covering up the story.  I think the posses that go around killing the zombies are pretty interesting, too.  They treat the whole thing more like a good time than a somber necessity.

The Night of the Living Dead rejuvenated the quality, low budget horror film and it reminds me a lot of the Val Lewton philosophy that sometimes the less you see, the scarier it is.  It's not the bloody, gore filled movies that came after it, but it is many times more effective and certainly gave birth to the modern zombie.",1318032000,2,4249,4.621333333333333

The couple at the beginning in the graveyard are the `liberals' who flirt with black power and end up paying the price:  the guy is killed by one of them and the girl loses her mind in a drug-like induced insanity and  the failure of liberal idealism. The couple that insists on hiding in the basement are the `white flight' people who refuse to help the black guy fight off the zombies. They `escape to the suburbs,' so to speak. Ultimately, the couple is killed by their own child who becomes a zombie (i.e. joins the radical black power movement.) The other couple who were hiding in the basement represent the college- educated liberal class who are open- minded and choose to help the black guy quell the riots. Ultimately, they pay the price also for getting involved in what they do not understand. And, of course, in the end the black guy is killed by a bunch of yahoos who were shooting the black rioters (zombies)....",1301788800,4,1153,4.587378640776699
472368,5,6302484367,"The original NOTLD (circa 1968) was truly a classic.  This laser-disc version is true to its classic form. It has two audio commentary tracks (one with Judith O'Dea, Russ Streiner, Bill Heinzman, Kyra Schon, Keith Wayne, and Vince Survinski and the other with George Romero, Karl Hardman, John Russo and Marilyn Eastman). It is fun to listen to the commentaries which give insight into what went into making this film.  It serves as a historical time capsule since many of the original stars, namely Duane Jones, Karl Hardman and Keith Wayne have passed away.  The quality of the film is clear and still holds up as a frightening look at something that exploits our most basic fears, which are being alone in a graveyard and death.
  Even though this film has been imitated, it has never truly been duplicated (in terms of its ability to produce terror).  Most people remember the first time they saw the film and for many, the pants are still scared off them.  I couldn't sleep for days when I first saw it.  In addition, many people were introduced to George Romero's brand of horror and the underlying messages within them.  In most commentaries, Romero claimed that NOTLD was made just to make a movie and there was no attempt to say anything.  Perhaps the reason why the movie speaks to people so much is because of the time it premiered (the turbulent 1960's is all over this film).  The main character, Ben, was black; this was almost unheard of in those days.  People think of the Jim Crow and the ensuing Civil Rights movement (especially when he was killed by the posse at the end.)  Arm-chair generals arguing over Vietnam War manuevers come to mind when Ben and Harry clash as they debate the best plan of action (stay on the main floor of the house or hide in the basement.) The isolation of the characters and their trapped circumstance (the feeling of claustrophobia) are also presented. This movie still scares after over 40 years.",1301184000,,1947,4.6911764705882355
472369,5,6302484367,"I can remember the first time I ever saw NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. My two cousins and I were visiting back where I grew up, Akron, OH, and we saw that it was playing at a nearby drive-in. The bad news was that it was the last movie but we didn't care. We watched GIMMEE SHELTER starring the Rolling Stones and then PINK FLOYD AT POMPEII, both good music/concert movies. But we were here for the legendary film we had never seen.

The movie finally started and even though it was in black and white, perhaps a first for us at a drive in since we weren't part of the initial teens that flocked there, it still had an impact on me. I remember being totally creeped out by the things that happened in the film. And inside a part of me kept thinking what would you do if you woke tomorrow to discover that the world was indeed overrun by zombies determined to eat your flesh?

That's the whole set up to George Romero's original classic. Simple and to the point. We don't get involved explanations as to how this happened; we just know that it did. A hint about the possibility of a virus from space is mentioned but that's it.

The film opens with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting the graveyard where their mother is buried. Remembering how the cemetery used to frighten her when she was young, Johnny teases her saying ""They're coming to get you, Barbara"". Upset with him she leaves him behind and walks up to a man she sees in the cemetery. Unfortunately she and her brother have no idea what's going on and the man turns out to be the first zombie we see. When Johnny comes to her aid, he falls and smashes his head, leaving her defenseless.

Barbara runs to the car, jumps in and discovers that she has no keys. With the zombie trying to get in, she releases the emergency brake and the car rolls down the hill only to crash. Ahead of the slow moving zombie (Romero's zombies were always slow moving, not like the ones we see today), Barbara runs to a local farmhouse only to find the family who lives there half eaten. As she starts to leave a truck pulls up and Ben (Duane Jones) runs in.

Duane finds Barbara in a state of shock. The pair begins to look through the house and eventually discover a family and a young couple hiding in the cellar. Ben isn't happy with this as they would have left Barbara upstairs to die before coming to her aid. And so begins a clash of egos as Ben and the father Harry (Karl Hardman) continue to disagree with almost every plan they come up with to protect themselves.

As the zombies lay siege to the secluded house, the folks trapped inside watch the local news and learn what's going on. They watch as zombies are shot, gathered up and burned to prevent more coming back to life. People can't believe that this is happening and the more they try to keep their loved ones home with them, the more zombies are produced.

It's a long night and not everyone will survive. They must come together as a team or their chances of survival are non-existent. If they can just hold out till morning, perhaps the local sheriff's men can come to their rescue. IF they can just hold out.

The thing that makes this movie scary is the realism that it uses from start to finish. These people seem like your every day ordinary folks, all brought together under the worst circumstance possible. The fact that these were not nationally known actors helps. Recognizable names would have detracted from the story and from the feeling these could be real people.

The movie doesn't rely on extreme gore though for its day I am certain people thought it was outrageous. But this is one of those movies where less is more and with less, viewers begin to insert their own memories, recalling things like squirting blood and entrails being pulled from bodies. The truth is it doesn't happen. Perhaps some nibbling on a hand or two, but nothing near what came later in Romero's films.

Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is how well it holds up after some 42 years. Can it really be that old? Sure parts seem a bit dated, the cars, and the clothes. But the whole thing seems as if it came out just yesterday to me. Watching it now it still offers a good scare or two. Who would have thought all those years ago that this small, independent film would become one of the all time highest grossing independent films of all time? Or that it would inspire a host of sequels from its director as well as remakes by other film makers. It is truly a classic and one that deserves not just to be watched but a part of your collection as well.",1301011200,,4601,4.396004700352527

When people read ""Widescreen Version"" on the back of DVDs, buyers normally take that as referring to the film itself. Well, the film on this DVD is in ""Fullscreen"" (1.33:1 aspect ratio). It seems that when it says ""Widescreen Version,"" it is only referring to the Menus and Special Features on the disc. Only people who know what ""1.33:1"" means will understand from this statement that the film is Fullscreen. It should be more clear and say something like ""Film presented in Fullscreen 1.33:1 aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition. Menus and Features presented in Widescreen."" Otherwise, this statement on the back cover is very confusing to buyers.

472403,5,6302484367,"I just want to start by saying that I gave this film 5 stars because it is the film itself that deserves them, not the blu-ray releases.

Unfortunately, the 'network' edition of Night of the Living Dead is a complete let down (putting it lightly). They must've used a really bad transfer if they were getting it from the original 35 mm elements.

First of all, the UK has two versions of NOTLD available on Blu-ray: the Optimum release, and the Network release (this is the blu-ray that is also available in the US). The Optimum version was almost perfect! The sound and quality was ideal and looked like they had used the original negative to transfer the film to blu-ray. However, what makes that version extremely annoying is that the image is cropped in the Optimum release. It isn't too bad in the beginning but the cropping becomes alarmingly worse and noticeable as the film continues. I don't understand why! If they got everything else right, why not leave the original image to its original size?

Now for the network release... (The one with the green cover and the hand reaching across). The image is not cropped in this release. It is presented in its original size. However, for some reason, the people at Network felt the need to play with colour correction. At times, the image is sooo blown out, that you can barely see Barbara's face or what is happening on-screen, like when Ben lights a fire in front of the farmhouse. Compare Elite's Millennium Edition or George Romero's 40th Anniversary Edition with this blu-ray. You will wish you had never bought the blu-ray because the DVDs are of a much higher quality (picture and sound wise). The sound in Network's version becomes very screechy at times. When the music becomes loud, it sounds like the film is attempting to tear your speakers apart. The final thing I want to mention about the Network release is the ghastly decision to use a copy of the film that is missing about 30 seconds of the film! It means that you're not only buying a sub-standard copy of the film, but also a copy that is missing dialogue and quick scenes. To some, missing a few seconds may not be much of a deal, which is fair enough. For me, it is appaling!

Basically, if you are extremely desperate to have this film on blu-ray, rather go for the lesser of two evils and buy the Optimum version from the UK. It has the original 60s poster as a cover with the tagline 'they won't stay dead' on it. Personally I would recommend that you stick with your Millennium or 40th Anniv. Editions, or simply buy one of those if you don't already own the film.

It is a travesty for them to release such bad quality films on blu-ray! The only reason for these blu-rays existing is because the movie is in public domain as most of you know. This makes it extremely hard to find the right quality versions of this film as there are so many out there! What makes it worse is that people buy these bad versions and help the producers of these bad releases make more money which in turn, gives them the incentive to continue producing these versions. Rather save your money for the day Elite decides to transfer the film to blu-ray properly, or hopefully Criterion decides to make their own blu-ray.

If you don't own the film, these are the two versions you should consider:

George Romero, you're brilliant.  Your influential zombie movie came out in 1968 and it still holds up today.  Dozens of walking zombies terrorizing some people trapped in a farmhouse makes for a fun and frightening movie.  This review is of the 40th Anniversary original black-and-white movie DVD, not the one that has both the black-and-white and colorized versions on the same disc.  And not the pitiful 30th Anniversary edition.

This 1968 cult classic stars Judith O'Dea, Duane Jones, Marilyn Eastman, Karl Hardman, Judith Ridley and Keith Wayne.  Basically the plot is this:  Zombies have risen from their graves to feed on living humans.  They are chasing (actually slowly stumbling around) people all over about 1/3 of the country.  One of these people being chased is Barbra (Judith O'Dea), who had been with her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) at a cemetery visiting their father's grave.  Her brother comes into contact with a wandering zombie and dies.  Barbra escapes and comes across a farmhouse where the residents are not there.  She hides inside.  She is shaken and in shock and comes across as being quiet and helpless for most of the movie.  Soon after, Ben (Duane Jones) arrives at the farmhouse in a pickup truck for shelter and a safe haven as well.  In all, seven people (five of which were in the cellar before Barbra and Ben even arrived) are seeking refuge in this farmhouse to try to get away from the swarm of zombies outside.  Ben had arrived at the farmhouse in a pickup truck, but the truck's gas gauge is on empty.  The people inside the farmhouse board up the place and look for an escape route when the opportunity presents itself.  There is a lot of infighting between the people inside the farmhouse.  It gets violent at times.  Some of the people who came in contact with the zombies become zombies themselves.  That's the story in a nutshell.  I don't want to give away too much.

The acting in this movie isn't worthy of an Academy Award for anybody, but it's at least adequate or pretty good and the important thing to realize is that this is an independent film with unknown actors.  Barbra is helpless and quiet while Ben is a ""take charge"" kind of guy.  I find this movie very entertaining and frightening.  It's also very gorey.  Shockingly gorey.  The movie's atmosphere and music are good.  This was truly a groundbreaking movie that paved the way for other zombie films in the decades to come.

This 40th Anniversary DVD comes with very good special features, including audio commentary by members of the cast and crew, a feature-length documentary, a Question and Answer session with George Romero, an interview with Duane Jones, the theatrical trailer, a still gallery, and the original script.

If you like and appreciate independent horror movies that are low budget but ""do the job"" and don't have Hollywood's influence, then this movie falls into that category and you should enjoy it.  Very highly recommended.",1268697600,3,2997,4.869306930693069

472499,5,6302484367,"Years ago I read a very extensive essay on NOTLD by R.H.W. Dillard which is about the best ""review"" of the film that I could ever imagine reading.  That said, this is a movie that has always stuck with me for reasons unknown.  Could it be the ultra-realistic documentary style?  The super-low budget production values?  The other-worldly black & white photography?  The matricide?  The redneck posse?  The random slaughter of Ben?  The fact that the guy everybody hated and didn't want to listen to turned out to be right all along?  Answers to these questions are unnecessary.

The film is great, but it's also extremely disturbing.  Too many people have attributed it's success to it's breaking of taboos at the time of it's release, but it's more.  There is a sense that you come away with that says to you ""humans aren't going to make it when the going gets tough"" - Romero doesn't have much confidence in us.  When we need to come together, we all fall apart, divided, petty, scared, and the monsters that are all around us that have waited for the chance to pounce will suddenly enter like an unstoppable deluge...not just like a wind passing through.

As to the DVD version that you should get -  make sure it's the Millenium Edition.  Hands down.  And by all means, stay away from John Russo's ridiculous 30th Anniversary ""reimagining"".

Though now unavailable from regular DVD sellers, including Amazon, buyers who want it don't need to resort to the inflated ""collector's item"" prices sometimes quoted by small or private sellers. The DVD is *not* out of print or rare: the Weinstein Company merely decided to make it a ""Best Buy Exclusive,"" now available only at that company's retail stores and on-line. It is the identical disc, liner, and case. The external slip-case now has a blue border on the front that indicates ""Best Buy Exclusive""; a new UPC code sticker is pasted on the back above the original one--but note, *over* the plastic wrap, so it's gone once you open the the wrap. It's a normal, easily obtained item from BB for $14.99. I bought it at BB myself already. See their web site to order it on-line or to check for in-store availability.

This edition is, far and away, the most astonishingly perfect transfer, from the original negative, of this seminal film, supervised by director George Romero himself. It exceeds even the old Elite Collector's or Millennium Editions in quality. It is loaded with extras, both new and old. And for those of us who are hearing-impaired, it finally is supplied with optional English subtitles.

472505,5,6302484367,"With time running out before Halloween and remembering my promise to myself to write 31 horror movie reviews by the time of the 31st, I felt as though I were running low, considering how in the past I've already reviews plenty of horror movies. Then I thought, ""Hhmm...I haven't done a review for Night of the Living Dead yet!"". So here it is, a review of what is considered probably the most important and influential zombie movie of all time.

Although it's not the first movie in the zombie-horror subgenre, (""White Zombie"" beat it, being made in 1932) ""Night of the Living Dead"" is without a doubt, the most infleuntial zombie movie of all time, and probably the greatest one, too. Although it lacks the gore of later Romero classics such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""Day of the Dead"", ""Night of the Living Dead"" is still a revolutionary horror film for several huge reasons.

First off, having a black guy as a hero was a big step at the time, considering this movie was made in the late '60s. Romero wanted to show that with the changing times, there was no racial boundaries on who gets to be the hero in a movie. And although I'm a white guy, I like his decision a lot, because it showcases a call to revolution.

Also, the movie itself is a social and political statement, about the new society, in this case, literally devouring the old one. Had the new society's devourment of the old society only been for the better this day and age...it's tough for me to be young and growing up in our culture these days! But Romero definitely had a brilliant idea with that underlying message in mind.

Now, we're on to the zombies. Combining the claustrophobic atmosphere of the house and the overpowering feeling of fear and doom caused by the start of the zombie apocalypse, ""Night of the Living Dead"" gets everything right. Although fast zombies were to be later featured in more recent horror films, the zombies in ""Night of the Living Dead"" are the epitome of classic, death-paced, flesh-eating horrid fiends.

I saw the movie online so I know nothing about the different DVD versions but I hear that the Millennium Edition is the best to get, so getting that one is probably the best thing. However, I did read that when purchasing any version of ""Night of the Living Dead"", none of the money will go to George A. Romero or any of the makers, so watching it online might be a good alternative. Any way you watch it, this is a zombie movie classic!

Other survivors named Ben, Harry, Helen, Tom, and Judy join her, and try to board up the house to stay safe. There is competition between Ben and Harry over who should be the leader.

The 3D version is a total quickie conversion scam. I was using passive polarized glasses with the correct interlace settings and all it does is make the viewing screen look a bit deeper, so you are basically looking at 2D - just a bit further back; THAT IS NOT 3D. Oh, and who ever produced this decided to super impose a few 3D gimmicks over the original 2D movie (terribly done and VERY very little of it). So, you're basically watching a 2D Movie with about 4 seconds of 3D that looks like it was created by a pre-teen with a laptop. I can only imagine how the anaglyph(red/cyan paper glasses) version looked. Probably even worse, plus a major headache.

472599,5,6302484367,"In 1968 George A. Romero took the world by storm with an incredibly violent, low-budget, horror film that introduced what would grow to be the modern day interpretation of the living dead (referred to as zombies by most modern day moviegoers).  These creatures are the reanimated corpses of the recently deceased, they shuffle, moan and eat the flesh of the living, and the only ways to kill them being incineration and a fatal blow to the head (via gunshot or clubbing).  Naturally these aspects would lead these monsters into being the most common form of canon-fodder in today's video games.

In recent years the zombies, due to their stupidity, and the fact that they are easy to kill, have made them nothing more than things for the heroes of a film to blow apart in increasingly gruesome manners (so long as they're zombies the MPAA does not care how the characters go about killing them).  So what is it about Romero's first Dead film that makes these creatures so darn scary?  Two out of the three sequels to this cult classic (the classic Dawn of the Dead, and the more resent Land of the Dead) have used these creatures to create socially satirical environments exploiting human nature, while never bringing real spine tingling moments, the concepts (at least in Dawn) were equally frightening to the horror of Night of the Living Dead, just in a more psychological aspect.

How do these pitiful excuses for monsters bring in the scares within this low-budget exploitation film?  I'd have to place my bet on the claustrophobic atmosphere Romero creates within the farmhouse, where ninety-five percent of the film takes place.  In films such as Dawn, and Day of the Dead the characters had a lot more maneuverability.  They could run, they could hide, and easily out maneuver these slow, clumsy creatures.  Here, there is no room to move about, and you can feel that there truly is no way out, and no place to hide.

The film starts as a brother and sister drive to apply the annual decoration to their father's grave.  The two individuals are Barbra and Johnny, and as the two leave they are assaulted by a man.  Barbra flees to a nearby farmhouse, and the story begins.  Soon after she arrives she encounters a strong willed man by the name of Ben, who quickly establishes that Barbra is hysterical and must be taken care of.  Taking responsibility for both their survival Ben soon boards up the doors and windows, preparing to sit the infestation out until help arrives.

During the stay they discover some more survivors living in the house's cellar.  There's the eager to help young man by the name of Tom, and his loyal girlfriend Judy, and then the paranoid Harry Cooper, his wife Helen, and their ill daughter Karen.  Mister Cooper instantly protests against the command of Ben, saying that they all should retreat to the cellar, because there's only one way in and out of the cellar, as opposed to the house with its many doors and windows.  Ben denies this, not wanting to be enclosed in a death trap without any means of escape if things were to go badly (which you know they will).  In the end it seems only ironic as to how each character meets his or her fate.

I must point out the Ben character played by Duane Jones because he is obviously the star of this film, and for good reason.  Considering this was the 1960s, and racism was still a huge factor throughout the country it feels remarkable to see such a well done performance by an African American actor, with such great intensity, especially with such a low-budget.  He is strong willed, and won't let people change his mind, even to the point of ignorance, but he does so with such passion we, the audience, can't help but side with him as the character, even when he is clearly wrong at times with his decisions.  His survival techniques are not perfect, but with his strong attitude he is able to make the survivors inside the house side with him, over the over-cautious (yet, in all fairness, intelligent) Harry Cooper.

This film has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the best horror movies to date, and still beats out all of today's zombie films by a mile.  Here the zombies really are scary, without resorting to being anything more than slow moving, clumsy beings (unlike the remake of Dawn of the Dead where they felt inclined to super power the creatures).  Also, the setting is so normal it further increases the scare factor.  How many people haven't been in houses like the one in this film?  Imagine being trapped in one of these houses, surrounded by vicious flesh-eaters in the late hours of the night.  This is where Night of the Living Dead succeeds where others of the genre have miserably fallen.  If it wasn't for the original Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead (both of which have been remade with a less positive response from critics and audiences alike) zombies would be some of the worst movie monsters ever conceived.  This film innovated and created the concept of the living dead which have been embraced by mainstream audiences, and it is fitting that it is perhaps the ONLY film involving the creatures that has legitimately frightened me.  Maybe it was watching it at night with the lights turned off, but I can say that few films have actually scared me when I watched it.  Let me put it this way, most classic horror films that truly deserve their status don't scare me when I'm watching them, but end up poking my mind later on in the day (Examples are The Shining and the original Nightmare on Elm Street).  With this film I was constantly holding my breath, and looking about the room nervously.

The reason I was frightened (and surprised) by this film was due to its incredibly fast pacing, which is very similar to the way films are made today.  This film just never has its dull moments (not to say I like all action, I was just surprised how quick it was).  The plot is extraordinarily simple, and could've easily been covered in thirty minutes, but Romero was careful to grab the audience in the first attack scene, and keep their attention through means of suspense and violence.

Now that brings us to the violence, and there is nothing that the undead are more associated with then excessive amounts of blood and gore.  For the 1960s this film is incredibly violent, especially when it shows the undead feeding on the flesh of their victims.  Being low-budget the victims are not seen being torn apart like they are in the sequels, but you still are given some disgusting shots of flesh from the bones, or fighting over intestines, which in some perverse way reminded me of people fighting over a chicken wing at a local KFC buffet.  The images are just truly grotesque, maybe not to the avid, modern day gore lover, but to the common moviegoer it still holds up as being disturbing.

This is the best film of the living dead subgenre, followed closely by its sequel, Dawn of the Dead, and certainly holds up in all regards to the modern, brainless horror film.  The film goes out to scare, and manages to pull it off, even to this day.  Though the zombies are most associated with gore, and for the 60s this film surely had it, this is a film with more brain than blood, and that's why it has terrified people for so long, and will continue to do so, even as the creatures continue to become even less threatening through video games and modern interpretations (which happen to be video game based, for the most part).  With their decline as an actual icon of terror, at least we can still return to the gut wrenching human struggle, and terror of George A. Romero's definitive horror picture.

5/5 stars; a classic that has endured the test of time with more strength, emotionally, and in the form of pure terror, than many films of the same era which possessed a larger budgets, certainly being on par with some of Hitchcock's greats.",1225238400,6,7888,4.629576453697057
472600,4,6302484367,"This is by far the best of the colorized versions of this film.

They did a pretty good job with it overall, although there are some spots were it seems weird (the car is bright orange and looks like the General Lee from Dukes of Hazzard...and whats up with the psychodelic colored walls???) it is solid overall.  The fire is mesmerizing looking, but Ben's skin tone isn't quite right (at least i hope not).

The quality of the picture isn't bad, but it still is not as sharp as some of the remastered black and white versions of this film.  so this version is a little more blurry, but not enough to detract from the overall enjoyment of what you're looking at.

The movie itself is unchanged.  No new cuts, edits, or soundtracks, just the original stuff.

The bonus features are lame, and the commentary track is retarded and not even worth listening too.

Basically, if you want to see what this movie is like in color, buy this one.  It actually makes it feel like a whole new movie, and you find yourself thinking ahead and trying to guess what color various things in the film are going to end up being.

472604,5,6302484367,"Like its zombies, Night of the Living Dead just seems to keep coming back from the grave.  The latest DVD release of the classic is a 40th anniversary edition that comes with an outstanding set of extras.  There's no doubt that Night of the Living Dead is one of the most influential horror films of all time.  George Romero and John Russo didn't invent zombies on film, but their prototype of the shambling, flesh-eating, shoot-the-head to kill them, has become the zombie of choice in popular culture.  Without Night of the Living Dead we probably wouldn't have Max Brooks' World War Z or other popular zombie fiction novels; we probably wouldn't have video games and film series like Resident Evil.  When you consider the film was made on a budget of around $100,000, produced and acted by essentially amateurs, it makes its status all the more incredible.  The film was a community effort.  The actors served as producers, directors, and make-up artists.  Everyone did multiple duties.  If the film did have a bigger budget it likely would not have the same impact.  Can you imagine it being in color rather than its stark black & white?

The lack of funds forced the crew to be creative.  Chocolate syrup stood in for blood, mortician's makeup was used to fashion the zombies, and a fireworks expert created the gunshot effects.  The eerie soundtrack was stock music taken from a variety of sources.  If some of it sounds like it came from a campy 1950's Sci-Fi film you'd be right on the money as some of it did come from the 1959 film Teenagers from Outer Space.  Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman who played Mr. and Mrs. Cooper, also provided the sound effects and Eastman did the makeup.  Modern critics have lauded the film for its subversive qualities and Vietnam-era take on American Society.  But when you hear the actors talk about the film you don't get the idea that they were trying to send any messages to viewers.  They were just trying to make a scary horror film.  Night of the Living Dead is an instance where the planets aligned just right and in a remarkable confluence of events and efforts, a near perfect horror film was created.  The amateur actors work because they are real people and not professionals.

This 40th anniversary edition features a fully restored and re-mastered cut of the film with features overseen by George Romero himself.  First, there are two audio commentaries:  One featuring Romero, Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, and John Russo.  The second features Producer/Actor Russ Streiner (Johnny), Judith O' Dea (Barbra), Kyra Schon (Karen Cooper), and Karl Hinzman (cemetery zombie).

The main attraction of the 40th Anniversary Edition is the brand new, 83-minute documentary that covers the film from beginning to end.  The documentary opens in black & white as an SUV drives through a cemetery.  The film switches to color as Streiner and O'Dea visit the same grave where they placed a wreath forty years earlier.  The documentary features comments from almost all the surviving cast members including Eastman, Hardman (who just passed away recently), Schon, Hinzman, George Kosana (Sheriff McClelland) Bill Cardille (reporter who played himself), and Ella Mae Smith who played a zombie, along with Romero, Russo, and others in the crew.

It's fascinating to hear their stories and memories about making the movie.  Russo and Streiner returned to the infamous basement where little Karen killed and ate her mother.  The basement was actually in an office building in Pittsburgh and looks much the same today.  Streiner laments about a flood, which destroyed a number of the film's assets including prints and press kits.  Hinzman (who looks actually younger now than he did as the Cemetery Zombie) talks about the problems he had breaking the window of Barbra's car with a rock.  They also discuss the mistake made in not copyrighting the film, which fell into public domain a few years after the release where it remains today.  The documentary alone makes this edition a must have.

""Speak of the Dead"" is a 15 minute Q & A with George Romero that took place at the Bloor Cinema in Toronto in August of 2007.  Romero discusses many of the film's influences including the EC Comics from his youth.

""Ben Speaks"" is an audio only interview with Duane Jones.  The last interview the reclusive actor and professor gave in December 1987.  He would pass away the following Summer.

The gore is awesome! It has the classic look and feel of the late 60's. On a dark night, the dead come back to life and feast on the flesh of the living. Barbra and her brother, Johnny are attacked, but Barbra makes it to a seemingly abandoned farmhouse to take refuge. Other survivors named Ben, Harry, Helen, Tom, and Judy join her, and try to board up the house to stay safe. There is competition between Ben and Harry over who should be the leader.

I ordered this DVD under the assumption that this was the special edition, but, trust me, it is not.  This is a bootleg version (if you look on the bottom of the discs, you can see where the dvds were burned)that was created with cheap DVD authoring software.  The two discs do not contain any special features whatsoever except for a lame still photos function that truly sucks.  In fact, the movie (which looks horrible) is split up on the two discs with a trailer for some garbage porn/action movie shot on video at the head of each disc.  Do not buy this pile of crap.  I'm surprised amazon sells it -- it's obviously a bootleg.  If you have an earlier version, like the THX Elite or the other one that came out a few years back, stick with those...or get the REAL 40th disc approved by Romero, which is selling for ten dollars cheaper than this one.

There are no stars and Duane Jones (Ben) is the only substantial character (other than catatonic Barbara played by Judith O'Dea).  It was shot on a shoestring budget (estimated at a little over $100,000) around Pittsburgh, PA.

The movie starts swiftly and emerges the audience without any warning into a nightmarish world.  The quick pace of the film makes it easy to watch, and the intensity of it all--gripping the edge of your seat to see what happens next--totally captivates.

This movie is truly enjoyable.  In the original black and white, it is an eerie film, not gory or gruesome.  It is terrifying.

This edition also comes with the colorized version, which is not bad, but just strange (some colors are so vibrant and intense it shifts the mood of the scene, meanwhile other colors are paled or grayed and actually enhance the feeling of the scene).  Watch it in black and white first, and then try it in color.

""Night of the Living Dead"" is the most serious of the Romero Quartet (Night, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead & Land of the Dead). Night, like Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"", is shot in B/W, and this adds dramatically to the feel of the film. Compare the B/W version to the colorized version and it's clear which one is more cinematically creative (the former!!). Well scripted and acted, Night is a must see during the Halloween season. The end sequence is the most disturbing - not gore-filled or scary, but disturbing - in the way the end of American History X is disturbing (racial prejudice being at the heart of both!).

It is one of those horror films that require multiple viewings to appreciate its Idiosyncrasies.  It is so much more than a zombie movie.  This movie is a testament to the times.  The point of this movie is as undead as its characters...If we do not work together, we die together.

The premise is that Evil is stalking humanity.  The film opens with ""zombies"" attacking people and comes together with the main characters finding refuge in an abandoned house in the middle of NOWHERE!

Its pessimism is unrivaled...And the plot is revealed...

Romero's opinion shines through, that humans, when faced with a common enemy that threatens their very existence will fail to bond and fight as one. Rather, in our typically selfish way, we will succumb to petty prejudices.

Romero illustrates this opinion when the ""zombies"" begin to penetrate the home, just as the characters begin to argue.  As their arguements escalate, the ""zombies"" make more ground.  In the end, noone survives.

Abraham Lincoln said it best and Romero exemplified it...""United we stand, divided we fall"".  THINK ABOUT IT!!!",1211587200,2,1125,5.0162162162162165
472690,5,6302484367,"If you want to pick up this timeless horror classic, theres really only two ways to go. if you don't mind spending a little more, the Millenium Edition is deffinitely the way to go, with its multitude of bonus features. other than that, the 2 versions are identical (picture/sound/ect). this version also features an all new 80 minute documentary, some incentive for even the Millenium Edition owners to purchase this one. only if they're they most hardcore of fans though.

Everyone knows the story, the recently deceased are rising from the dead to feast on the warm flesh of the living. it opens with that legendary scene in the graveyard, along with perhaps the most quoted line in horror (THEY'RE COMMING TO GET YOU BARBARA) it doesnt take long for things to lose control. the sudden attacks by seemingly normal people interrupt the sibling quarreling between Barbara and her brother. Barbara runs and takes shelter in a nearby farmhouse. she meets some other survivors and as they barricade themselves inside, a lot of attention is paid to the character interactions, and how we would react to one another in such a situation. who will live to see morning?.. you probably already know but still..

the special features are probably the main draw for most of us in this case, and they deffinitely delivered the goods. 2 commentary tracks. one from Romero, one from the cast. 80 min documentary on the making of and events leading up to NOTLD. audio only interview with Duane Jones, and a 15 min Q+A with Romero.

472721,4,6302484367,"Having owned a couple of the earlier public domain releases, I'm pleased to say that the quality of this new ""remastered"" print is pretty darned good, all things considered.

The greatest value of the disc, however, is in the extras.  The nearly and hour-and-a-half documentary, ""One For The Fire"", is by itself worth the modest price of the DVD.  It covers the entire genesis of the film, beginning with Romero's earliest attempts at filmmaking and the production company formed by him and his college buddies through to the collective decision: ""Let's make a movie!"".  It also explains how it almost instantly (and accidentally) fell into the public domain and how all of the original elements of the film (along with all of the company's commercials and industrial films) were destroyed in a basement flood.  The documentarians seem to have interviewed almost everybody associated with ""Night of the Living Dead""'s creation and filming, and it's a fascinating journey that (unlike many DVD extras) doesn't need to rely on showing a lot of prolonged scenes from the movie just to fill the time.  It's very informative, engaging, and a great bonus for this release.

Also included is a 15-minute audio-only interview with lead actor Duane Jones, who seems to have kept his association with the movie very much at arm's length over the years.  It was recorded a year before Jones' death in 1988 and is candid and pretty riveting.

The 15-minute footage of a Romero Q&A at a comics convention isn't all that interesting, unfortunately, since the bulk of the information is covered in ""One For The Fire"".

I understand that the commentary tracks are carried over from an earlier DVD of the film (which might explain why the heard-in-the-background audio of the movie itself is out of synch with the picture, which is kind of annoying).  They're still entertaining, though.

Throw in a still image galley and a comically bad original theatrical trailer, and you've got a great bargain for the price.  While watching all of the extras, I was reminded of Criterion's DVD release of Herk Harvey's ""Carnival of Souls"" - in that it will probably be of most interest to filmmaking buffs in general than to casual fans of zombie movies.

Not really, but this 40th Anniversary Edition from the Weinstein Company's Dimension Extreme (who released Romero's recent Diary of the Dead) is a pretty good release of the landmark horror film.  Since we already know just how great, influential, and legendary Night of the Living Dead is, I won't bother going into the film's storyline, but will instead focus on the DVD itself.  Featured here are two commentary tracks that contain George Romero, John Russo, Judith O'Dea, Karl Hardman, and more besides, as well as an excellent hour and a half long documentary on the film's creation and legacy.  There is also an interesting video Q&A with Romero, and the final interview with Duane Jones.  There is also a still gallery, the film's trailer, and the ability to view the film's script via DVD-ROM to boot.  The special features alone are good enough for this single-disc release, and are worth the price of admission.  However, if you already own the superior Milennium Edition of the film, there really is no reason to pick this up.  If you don't though, then by all means pick up this new edition of Night of the Living Dead; it's a horror classic that even 40 years later can still scare the daylights out of you, and still proves ever effective.",1211328000,19,1378,4.7364016736401675

Other than a photo gallery, there are no extras. While that would have been nice, it is no big deal. The trade-off is that this Blu Ray is the absolute best this film has ever looked and sounded.

472728,5,6302484367,"After doing a very detailed research of this product online in many different serious and complete product pages, i sincerely didn't find anything new about the picture or sound quality, or any improvements on the film itself whatsoever , something that can make this DVD edition worth to buy again! I think we all got the edition of our preference of this classic milestone, epic landmark, outstanding masterpiece that changed, using the director's passion, ingenuity, and imagination more than an actual production budget, the fate of the horror genre forever. I'm really holding myself to keep writing about this incredible masterful work , this accidental , disturbing, visceral, gruesome, menacing and creepy portrayal of paranoia and claustrophobic madness, a film that ended the concept of valiant heroes, happy endings and supernatural-related sources of evil and terror in the horror film genre of the late 60's. A rule shatterer for its time that excluded the emotional buffering proper of the audiences's standards, in this movie the good guys can't possibly win but only try to remain calm and sane, monsters become more powerful because of the endless unstoppable source of contagion that nobody can escape, authorities are dangerous and inept, friends and families turn against each other, prolonging their agonies in angst, fear and despair.... Add to this madness the macabre concept of the flesh eating zombies, re-animated corpses of our own people, blinded-by-hunger mindless ghouls made of human rotten shells. No wonder this independent low-budget movie shaked the foundations of american cinema, and haunted the collective fears of viewers with sheer realism.

Oops! Sorry for loosing my track. Going back to this edition, and only for the photos and comments of this product that i collected in every corner of the web, i'm pretty sure more than one fan will be absolutely thrilled about this 40 year anniversary DVD edition. All i can say so far, is that the best most acclaimed previous edition was re-released in this new great format with this spectacular cover signed by George A. Romero. I 'm almost positive that this extra material is new, but only based on mere trust, after all Romero loves to talk about his productions, detailing every possible aspect of production, details already published in thousands of interviews before, but for collectors it's always a pleasure. Fans who apreciate mr. Romero's interviews and comments must be excited about the promised new material, check the rest of the cast and crew audio comments. If they don't know about the shooting of the film, who does? Check the extras list to find out yourselves:

-Original screenplay DVD room only.
-Still gallery
-Original theatrical trailer (for this edition)
-Speak of the dead: interview with George A. Romero
-Last interview with Dwane Jones: Ben speaks.
-Documentary: One for the fire.
-Audio commentary: All new- George Romero, Karl Hartman, Marilyn Eastman, John Russo.

-English 2.0 mono original soundtrack (not confirmed)
-English 5.1 remastered dolby soundtrack

In my humble opinion, this extras are spectacular for any collector and a must see for fans. Too bad, yet another version of my favorite vintage horror movie of all times, it will be my third and i can't care less about money right now. Struggle with your thoughts and logic for a while, then order the movie. It's not that hard, it worked for me!

472729,5,6302484367,"As with any other horror genre, the groundbreaking zombie movie is the best. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a cult gem that has inspired every zombie movie after it, with its low-budget look and cast of excellent, unknown actors. And, of course, the flesh-eating undead who are rising to kill the living.

A crashed satellite starts emitting radiation, which somehow causes the dead to rise out of their graves to devour the living. Don't ask how, because it doesn't matter. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) is visiting a grave with her brother -- when suddenly a shambling, dead-faced man murders him, and chases her down the road to a farmhouse, where she manages to hide.

But she's not alone -- a kindly man named Ben (Duane Jones), a young couple, and a family are also hiding there. And without weapons or protection, they have very little chance of survival. The refugees barricade themselves for protection -- but now there are hundreds of zombies closing in. They must fight with fire and their wits... but it may not be enough to save them all.

""Night of the Living Dead"" is one of those horror movies that chills viewers right down to the marrow. Romero creates a nightmarish, claustrophobic atmosphere in his movie, where no matter where you go, you're trapped -- and the humans might kill you if the zombies don't. The finale is a tragic, but very realistic twist.

Originally filmed in murky black-and-white, Romero manages to make this film feel creepy even when the zombies aren't there. And while they're hiding in the farmhoruse, he takes the time to make it realistic -- the refugees grate on each other in a believable way (""I ought to drag you out there and FEED you to those things!"").

But then things get creepy, gross AND action-packed, when they slip out to fight the zombies. Romero switches the tone from eerie to downright terrifying -- the characters just reek of desperation -- and builds it up to a slam-bang finale. And along the way, we get terrified people fending zombies off with torches -- what could be better?

Duane Jones is the standout performance here: he's strong, kindly, take-charge and resourceful, but he also knows how to kick undead butt. By the finale, his character is the one that is remembered, especially given the haunting, shocking last scene, with an all-too-realistic racial undertone. But he was backed by excellent actors in Judith O'Dea, Karl Hardman, and dozens of zombie extras. Those people were amazing!

Stripped-down and stark, ""Night of the Living Dead"" is the sort of movie that should never be watched at night, and might make you look twice before going outside. Creepy, innovative and bizarre.",1208304000,11,2657,4.8392070484581495
472730,5,6302484367,"There have been numerous versions of this film circulating on DVD for years from cheap public domain copies on the 50 Movie Pack collections to more deluxe releases. Now here comes another version with - count them - two audio commentary tracks.

Along with ""Carnival of Souls"", this movie stands out as one of the definitive black-and-white horror movies of a bygone drive-in movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before, but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also, the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio, not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.

This movie showed something that could have only occurred pre-Watergate. At one point, the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington, reporters confront a government official about the situation, the government official tells the reporters the truth, and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens, government, and the media. Also, although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here, we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living, each time a victim is bitten, that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves, producing a problem that grows geometrically, just as vampires do.

Finally, this film has something important to say about race. Ben (Duane Jones), an African-American man, is the sole survivor of the group. Unique to 60's films, the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an African American as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. However, in the end, as morning arrives, Ben is sitting near a window of the farmhouse as the posse that is hunting down, shooting, and burning the zombies finally arrives. Happy to see his rescuers, Ben makes a movement, hoping the posse will see him. Unfortunately they do, and they shoot him dead. The film ends with Ben's body being carried from the house and being put in a pile about to be burned. He survived the whole ordeal for nothing. This begs the question, would the posse have shot first and asked questions later had they seen a white person waving from the window? Did they automatically assume - perhaps subconsciously - that there was no good reason for a black man to be in mainly white rural Ohio and therefore just assume he was a zombie? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder, but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignor. The extra features include:

In an arguable statement, I believe they dodged the ""We are going to change the world"" mentality of the late 60's and brought us a bare bones, practical, albeit entertaining, depiction of what was going on in the US and other parts of the world. That's getting deep. On the surface, we have the redefining of a genre (horror), monster/creature (zombies) and the impact that movies could have on you in general (forcing you to look over your shoulder when your alone in the dark, for the rest of your life). The Night of the Living Dead is not particularly scary, though, I admit, I watched this grainy version of the movie with shoddy sound during the day.  Not to mention the blinds were wide open.  But 'tis how I watch most horror movies. I am a wuss. Nonetheless, I can only imagine, that this movie was incredibly scary for its time. Kudos to the Romero/Russo vehicle.

472786,5,6302484367,"I spoke to someone recently who said he couldn't watch zombie movies because of Night of the Living Dead - not because it was scary, but because he felt the effects were bad and not scary enough.  I guess in an age of horror movies delivered to theatres on an almost weekly basis, it's hard for younger audiences to appreciate the delicacy of the classic that started it all.

Romero perfected the formula for horror by providing several key elements - a gang of strangers in an isolated area where they are trapped at night.  The isolation alone must have given moviegoers a scare back in 1968.  But it goes beyond that.  The crude effects and idea of the zombies, mindlessly attacking our unsuspecting heroes and the mere thought of the zombie child in the final act are terrifying.

But this was more than a mindless horror film.  The characters are incredibly flawed, but not by the mere stupidity that marks most modern horror films.  Barbara is understandibly hysterical while the Coopers and Ben argue about what to do.  The lack of teamwork between the characters may be their defeat.

But it's the film's conclusion that ultimately makes this film more than run of the mill horror.  The quiet music, radio communications and still photos at the end credits are unlike any other movie I've seen and must've moved the audiences from fright to pure shock back in 68.

If you are to purchase this film, go with the excellent Millenium edition.  It's probably the highest priced version, but worth every penny - with a beautiful remastering job and direct involvment with all the filmakers.  It included an interesting final audio interview with Duane Jones, the actor who played Ben, regarding how he became detached from the film, but still proud of it.  There's also an audio commentary, parts of an early film from Romero and a weird Night of the Living Dead parody - with bread of all things. As to how it holds up - turn your lights down and watch it alone at night - then ask yourself if it holds up.  It's more than effects that make a movie a horror film and Romero demonstrates that here.",1199577600,2,2102,4.62533692722372

472871,4,6302484367,"My buddy C. Blackshere, wrote a review on this classic horror movie in August and I certainly can't out do his wit!  But this is my version...

This movie is about ""freshly"" dead people that come back to life (walking like freaky zombies) to eat flesh.  The cause for their awakening is due to a possible radition contamination.

A group of sane people are hiding out in a house. One smart guy figures that he could board up the windows in this abandon house and wait it out.  He breaks nearly every piece of wood furniture in the place to board up the windows so the zombies couldn't enter.  I didn't know furniture could break that easily!  But then again, I underestimated my big poodle, Beau.  Anyway, the group struggles and eventually the zombies win and get them all, but one...

While I respect this movie as a horror classic, the story and filming were good for its time (1968), the acting was pretty bad and detracted from the story a bit for me.  The group was having a power struggle on deciding whether to go to the basement or remain on the first floor.  I couldn't understand why they didn't go to the upper floor and throw Molotov cocktails out the windows and remain there.  The zombies were having trouble walking, much less climbing the stairs!

All in all it is a good classic horror film to watch this time of month, just be blind to the acting.",1193011200,,1366,4.437751004016064
472872,5,6302484367,"Ironically, I decided on seeing ""Night of the Living Dead"" after reading The Undead and Philosophy: Chicken Soup for the Soulless (Popular Culture and Philosophy), (I am sure the authors did not have that response in mind). Anyway, after much reference to Romero's movies, I decided I had had a deprived existence for not having seen them.

Shot in black and white, Romero casts a dark and dank mood over the movie, making it all the more creepy. With the addition of some serious gore, (for 1968, that is), and some excellent photography, the movie starts the tension early and keeps it going right to the end. While the explanations for the zombie phenomenon are never really fleshed out, (no pun intended), the radiation from a space probe seems to be the one offered. The main characters are holed up in an isolated farm house, and each has distinctly different responses to their situation. Ironically, the very thing they fear seems to come to pass...until they all die, especially Ben, who actually escapes from the situation but it's gunned down by a bunch of racists rednecks.

Some of the sound effects seem decidedly ""cheesy"", such as the ""blood"" dripping from the stairs onto the floor. However, this is more than compensated for by the overall tension and darkness of the movie. This would have to be one of the creepiest movies I have seen.

I have not seen later editions, so this review refers to the original 1968 release. It is an excellent movie that spawned a whole sub-genre of horror movies. It is simply a masterpiece.",1192665600,,1541,4.764044943820225
472873,2,6302484367,"As long as I'm paraphrasing, I come to bury Romero, not to praise him.

A couple generations have come and gone since George Romero and a band of barely capable hacks created this film. In my lifetime I've seen no end of psuedo-intellectual praise heaped upon this glorified student film. Gore fans and hipsters alike have wasted volumes of paper and hard drive attributing sociological subtext and cinematic greatness to a movie that has neither.

The basic premise of the film remains fertile soil for someone with talent. The makers of 28 DAYS LATER and DAWN OF THE DEAD (remake) scared the hell out of us while demonstrating in a handful of grief-struck scenes the ramifications of World War Z on the living.

Romero, on the other hand,

--led amateur actors through terrible performances, from Barbara's poorly rendered catatonia to Angry Bald Man's puzzling decision to imbue every line with PURE! BLIND! FURY!

--generates a pace so leaden even the zombies could outrun it.

--spends an inordinate amount of time showing characters hammering boards. There are 2 minute-long carpentry sequences in this very worst episode of THIS OLD HOUSE.

--offers specious logic regarding the characters' escape plans. Only the first floor or the basement? No one considers moving upstairs and smashing the stairwell to bits behind them? There's certainly plenty of tools (see above)! And gravity still seems to affect the shambling dead.

--seems to have gleamed all his post-modern praise from the tacky inclusion at film's end of still frame shots of rednecks gleefully shooting zeds. I suspect this had more to do with the price of filmstock than any pure artistic decision. As even late 60s social commentary goes, it ain't exactly Easy Rider.

I've give Mr. Romero that his follow-up, Dawn of the Dead, was a helluva lotta fun in the 1970s drive-in I saw it in, but then its follow-up, Day of the Dead, was essentially as boring as an episode of MEET THE PRESS if MTP featured an undead round table. Even Savini's remake was more satisfying than this lump of hackery.

Romero's recent LAND OF THE DEAD took the WTF? step of actually identifying/sympathizing with the zombies, who, in a feat of contradiction you usually only see from Republicans, Romero has decided ARE PEOPLE TOO. There's some hamfisted class struggle commentary in there, but you'd need a decoder ring to make any sense of it.

As for the one that started it all, however, the only thing terrifying about NofLD is how fecund it is.",1192406400,2,2499,4.912114014251782

Romero --- Early drafts of the script were titled Monster Flick, but it was known as Night of Anubis and Night of the Flesh Eaters during production --- The film stars Duane Jones as Ben and Judith O'Dea as Barbra --- The plot revolves around the mysterious reanimation of the dead and the efforts of Ben, Barbra and five others to survive the night while trapped in a rural Pennsylvania farmhouse.

Russo (Screenwriter), Vincent Survinski (Production Designer), Marilyn Eastman (Makeup), Tony Pantanello (Special Effects), Regis Survinski (Special Effects) - - - - The story line and plot, Zombies represent a slow moving enemy --- It is easy to escape them, just watch out for your own mistakes, as the zombies will capitalize on them --- One of the best aspects of this film is the lead character, as director Romero presents an intelligent non stereotypical black actor in this cult favorite ---. this is one of the best horror films ever. Romero's direction is outstanding --- His ability to take a small budget and turn it into a stratospherically giant film is unparalleled.

Romero produced the film on the small budget of $114,000, but after a decade of theatrical re-releases it had grossed an estimated $12 million in the United States and $30 million internationally --- Night of the Living Dead was strongly criticized at the time of its release for its graphic content, but three decades later the Library of Congress entered it into the United States National Film Registry with other films deemed ""historically, culturally or aesthetically important.""

The culture of Vietnam-era America had a tremendous impact on the film --- It is so thoroughly laden with critiques of late-1960s American society that one historian described the film as ""subversive on many levels."" --- While not the first zombie film made, Night of the Living Dead influenced countless films and is perhaps the defining influence on the modern pop-culture zombie archetype --- The film is the first of five Dead films (completed or pending) directed by Romero --- It has been remade twice, in 1990 and in 2006.

This is 2-D to 3-D conversion of this 2-D movie, and probably the WORST conversion I've ever seen. I bought this DVD and watched the 3-D, hoping for fun. But, it is mostly flat 2-D that has just been pushed a couple inches straight back -- there's no 3-D form to anything. It's completely bogus.

This movie is classic black & white horror and well worth watching, without the extra eye strain of fake 3-D. Buy a normal DVD version.

The original version of this movie is a classic, and you can find it on DVD (ASIN: B00005Y6Y2, and many others) in a clean new digital re-mastering, with extras. Or, you can buy it in a double feature DVD, along with Carnival Of Souls, another classic black & white horror movie, for double the enjoyment (ASIN: B00005Y6Y2).

Night Of The Living Dead has also been remade (more than once) ... Most recently in 2006 and actually shot in real 3-D (not the fake '3-D' on this eye straining DVD). This 3-D remake version of Night Of The Living Dead 3D (2006) is available also on DVD (ASIN: B000TXPXC8 ). It was released theatrically in anaglyph 3-D, using red/cyan 3-D glasses. Though, it did have it's premiere showing using nicer polarized projection at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. So, look for a field sequential version of it, if you are a 3-D fan and own LCS shutter glasses already.

The extremely ironic ending was the icing on the cake and IMO is one of the best endings in horror history. My favorite in the ""dead"" trilogy by far.

The first thing we see before you press ""play movie"" is an eerie image of Barbara's face and a full moon with creepy music which sets the mood perfectly.

Being chased and cornered by undead humans who want to eat warm flesh had never been envisioned before this movie was envisioned.  While many good zombie movies have been made since its release, none has surpassed Night of the Living Dead's eerie atmosphere. Virtually all zombie films try to make some unholy marriage between horror, comedy, and gore (like Dead Alive and Return of the Living Dead).  Some even try to throw romance into the mix.  Night of the Living Dead, with its simplistic nature, just goes for scary and, because of that, it's still the best zombie movie ever made.  Roger Ebert, in his review of this movie, said that it was so scary when it was released that children were crying in the audience he was in.  And it's effective even today (especially the last 10-15 minutes).

472954,4,6302484367,"I liked this film more than most of the others here did. Giving the devil his due, the new footage does kind of interfere with Romero's original vision. I'll give you that. But, when the original was released, way back in '68, there wasn't enough money in the budget to execute it as intended. Romero should've redone it himself, granted, but this version tells where the first zombie came from. It's kind of funny, because Bill Hinzman is noticably heavier now, he has put on some weight over the years, so to see him somehow lose 10 or 15 pounds from the time he arises from his pine box, to the time he attacks Barbara and Johnny, it is a problem in the continuity, and mildly funny. But at least, it was the original actor.

And Scott Vladimir Lucina, as the minister, or priest, whatever; good musician, but he really should never give any serious thought to acting. I took this role with a grain of salt, because we all know at least one religious nut-job who acts like this. I just looked at him as an eccentric character. And bad acting may have actually helped here. And his real contribution, I feel, is the redone soundtrack music.

The original footage  has been beautifully restored, and unlike some who don't like it, I think the new soundtrack, as well as the new footage, is good. Exaggerated, spooky music almost always adds to a horror film. Although, sometimes, no music is better, notice the conspicuous absence of soundtrack music throughout most of ""The Exorcist?"" But here, it helps (just an opinion).

If you look hard enough, you will find many flaws in this film, but if you dwell on this, the story and production lose their camp value. The dialogue at the beginning, for instance, where Johnny and Barbara are talking about having more daylight from setting the clocks ahead, conflicts with the dead leaves on the ground, a sign of Fall. And in the house, where the undead are trying to get in, reaching through the boards over the windows, Tom hits one of the zombies' hands with a hammer. But, by some coincidence, it is the only hand that looks like it's made of wax. A sharp blow to the head is all that can actually ""kill"" them, but after one such head injury, the injured zombie opens his eyes and looks around the room as he is dragged outside. And these are all in the original footage. So, when the purists lambaste this version, even though I do sympathize, as I much prefer original versions of films to remakes myself, this isn't bad. I do like this incarnation, I think because the new material does compliment the old. The new scenes have the truck that Ben found at the truck stop, it was the one driven by the two grave diggers featured at the beginning, and they are shown as zombies prowling around after the firey truck accident that killed all those people, the one being described in the radio's news report.

Given the whole thing, I would have to say, what I didn't like was the new ending they put on, with the new actors. The original ending, was the ultimate in tragic irony. ""Good shot! Okay, that's another one for the fire!"" They should have left it at that, and gone straight to the closing credits. And this is what cost it a star in this review.

In its original form, this film was the ground-breaker, and in this form, it is given a little boost.",1179273600,,3308,4.505

Mainly because he is, which is sad considering that the guy's a genius.  The only other extra (apart from trailers) is a Zombie Celebrity 'game'.  It's not a game, it's not funny, who the frak cares.

  Night 68 ain't perfect, and it hasn't aged well, but for my money it is still powerfully frightening if you accept it for what it is.  The recent movie 28 Weeks Later starts with a homage to Night, proof of the movie's lasting influence.

  This is where the modern zombie movie all began.  A small group of people, thrown together by circumstance, are besieged in a farmhouse by an army of killers. As time passes, the nature of these crazed attackers is revealed, and it soon becomes obvious that unless our heroes can work out how to live together, they will die together....

  Romero's first zombie film, considered shocking and even Satanic in the late 60s, is almost tame by modern standards, lacking the gore and frenetic cutting that have become staples of the modern living dead flick.  It retains its' power to disturb, however, partly because it is so understated....and one cannot avoid the fact that this is the movie that started it all.  You don't start a whole genre with a turkey, after all.

  A 100% must buy for Romero fans, who are probably sick of buying yet another edition of the same movie (Survivor Cut, Millennium Edition, Fake 3D version etc), and also for those of limited imagination to whom black and white photography means 'boring old film'.  This movie's a stone cold

killer, babies.  And now it's in colour for the digital age.  May offend purists, but not as much as the 30th Anniversary Edition did. The ultimate indy drive-in horror movie.",1179100800,,2434,4.699763593380615
472957,5,6302484367,"With rare exception, the living dead in every zombie movie produced, behave precisely like they do in this film. Today, they stagger, stumble, gape, grope, chomp and chew guts just as they did under George Romero's direction. This film is the great grand daddy of zombie movies. I've heard the theories that the film is, at its base, about racism.  I've heard the opinions that it is a thinly veiled ""us against them"" metaphorical and moral diatribe against racial prejudice. The film can be construed as such, I suppose, but I don't think that was on the writer or director's mind at the time. Sure, some elements of racial hatred and vigilante justice seem present at the end, but I think the analogies are incidental to the story, perhaps utterly accidental. There is nothing ever accidental about racism. The real gist of the story is visceral horror, of girl children eating their mothers, of strange and grisly transformations, of shots to the head to kill cannibalistic, murderous zombies. I doubt the thought ever occurred to George Romero that casting Duane Jones as the black hero of the film might sharpen that racial edge that was basic to the story, `cuz it's not a theme in it. It didn't occur to Duane Jones either who said, ""It never occurred to me that I was hired because I was black. But it did occur to me that because I was black it would give a different historic element to the film."" It did that. Duane Jones was the first African-American to be cast as the hero in a horror film. The real value of this film is the legacy of horror it spawned for two generations of zombie movie fans. Is racism a persistent theme in zombie movies today? Perhaps a very marginal and an accidental one at best. And how do those racial demographics parse in terms of good guys and bad guys? I have no idea. I'm watching for the gaping, groping and gut chomping.",1177372800,2,1867,4.573134328358209
472958,2,6302484367,"I've been putting off watching this version of NOTLD for quite some time...every review I'd read about it warned me away from wasting my time and money on the 30th Anniversary edition, but finally curiosity got the best of me, and I rented it tonight.  While it's not as terrible as most reviewers would have one believe, it definitely could have been done better.  The idea itself had a lot of potential, but this potential is never realized.  I can see four main problems with this version.

First of all, the new scenes stick out like a sore thumb...as well-filmed as most of them are, and as much as some of the new scenes truly do serve the story (the scene of the family killed in the car crash coming back to life is as disturbing as any zombie scene from the original), they look far too ""clean"" to be grafted into the original 1968 version.  Surely there's some way to ""age"" this footage to make it look just as grainy as the original footage...even the near-pristine Millennium Edition released by Elite isn't quite as clean as the new scenes.  There should have been some attempt to keep some consistency between the orignal footage and the added scenes, even if it was at the expense of the picture quality of the new footage.

Second, there's the music.  Scott Vladimir Licina has composed a new score for the film that would sound right at home on a Midnight Syndicate album...but as much as I like that style of music, it has no place in a film that is as established a horror classic as NOTLD.  Here and there, the score of the original version, which was not composed specifically for the film but expertly pieced together from the Capitol Records Hi-Q Library, peeks through for a few minutes, but then is overtaken by Licina's modern synth-heavy score.  Just as with the new film footage, there is a big problem with consistency here.  The film should have either been completely re-scored with Licina's modern music, leaving out all of the original soundtrack (not an option I'm fond of, but an option nonetheless), or the original score should have been kept intact, possibly supplemented by compatible musical themes from the Capitol Records library or whatever its equivalent would be today.

Third, there's the issue of Bill Hinzman's character...as awesome as his original graveyard zombie was, there was no need to ""resurrect"" him for the new footage.  One could honestly mistake the zombie in the new footage as having been played by a different actor...the new scenes show him with a far pastier, paler complexion than his 1968 performance, and his hair isn't even consistent (but then, if you look closely in the original version, his hair is average-length in the cemetery scenes and is then in a crew-cut in the attack at the end of the film, so maybe this aspect is excusable, albeit in a tongue-in-cheek fashion).  This could have been worked around by simply not showing his face in the new footage...done properly, the audience would still be able to make the connection.

Finally, the ending was completely uncalled for...the radiation explanation suggested (but never completely established) by the original was more than adequate. The ""One Year Later"" nonsense forces us to sit through more apocalyptic ramblings by Licina's annoying priest character, who had already worn out his welcome by the time Hinzman's zombie puts the bite on him.  It also is a bit confusing, since at the very end we jump back in time to the bonfire and the gritty stills showing Ben's final moments.

In the bonus features, I saw John Russo, Russ Streiner, Bill Hinzman, and even Karl ""Harry Cooper"" Hardman participating in the filming of the new footage, but the one person from the original NOTLD crew who could have possibly pulled this off was nowhere to be found.  George Romero had nothing to do with this production...he likely knew better than to try improving on his original masterpiece.  In any case, while I may come back to view this version now and then just for something different, it in no way supplants the original version, no more than Dean Lachiusa's downright disrespectful ""Survivor's Cut"" does (but we'll save that for another review).  It's an intriguing aside, but the real collector's item is and always will be Elite's Millennium Edition.",1177200000,3,4283,4.81718963165075

473035,5,6302484367,"As with any other horror genre, the groundbreaking zombie movie is the best. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a cult gem that has inspired every zombie movie after it, with its low-budget look and cast of excellent, unknown actors. And, of course, the flesh-eating undead who are rising to kill the living.

A crashed satellite starts emitting radiation, which somehow causes the dead to rise out of their graves to devour the living. Don't ask how, because it doesn't matter. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) is visiting a grave with her brother -- when suddenly a shambling, dead-faced man murders him, and chases her down the road to a farmhouse, where she manages to hide.

But she's not alone -- a kindly man named Ben (Duane Jones), a young couple, and a family are also hiding there. And without weapons or protection, they have very little chance of survival. The refugees barricade themselves for protection -- but now there are hundreds of zombies closing in. They must fight with fire and their wits... but it may not be enough to save them all.

""Night of the Living Dead"" is one of those horror movies that chills viewers right down to the marrow. Romero creates a nightmarish, claustrophobic atmosphere in his movie, where no matter where you go, you're trapped -- and the humans might kill you if the zombies don't. The finale is a tragic, but very realistic twist.

Originally filmed in murky black-and-white, Romero manages to make this film feel creepy even when the zombies aren't there. And while they're hiding in the farmhoruse, he takes the time to make it realistic -- the refugees grate on each other in a believable way (""I ought to drag you out there and FEED you to those things!"").

But then things get creepy, gross AND action-packed, when they slip out to fight the zombies. Romero switches the tone from eerie to downright terrifying -- the characters just reek of desperation -- and builds it up to a slam-bang finale. And along the way, we get terrified people fending zombies off with torches -- what could be better?

Duane Jones is the standout performance here: he's strong, kindly, take-charge and resourceful, but he also knows how to kick undead butt. By the finale, his character is the one that is remembered. But he was backed by excellent actors in Judith O'Dea, Karl Hardman, and dozens of zombie extras. Those people were amazing!

A note of warning: Buy not the Alpha print. Horribly scratchy image and sound, to the point where I had difficulty telling what was going on. The best cheap print I've seen was the Diamond Ent. copy, paired with ""Dementia 13"" -- lovely, clear and sharp.

473038,5,6302484367,"I treated myself to a viewing of this DVD the weekend before this Halloween, and it reminded me what a transitional film George Romero had made back in 1968.  By then, we had already seen a decade of gore, what with sexploitation films like 1963's ""Blood Feast"", and with Sam Peckinpah's nausea-inducing (literally, for many patrons) ""The Wild Bunch"". But Romero couched his gore in shadows,  in eerie, silent, (read: no score) black and white, and then rooted his feet firmly in the future and the past. He paid homage to his film ancesters by reminding us of Frankenstein's monster stumbling towards the innocents (albeit in droves), seeking their blood (Dracula), and then to Orson Welle's infamous War of the World's broadcast, a play that would have been chilling enough had not tens of thousands of listeners not heard it and thought the radio reports of Martians attacking were real.  In NOLD, Romero has his live protagonists watch, horrified, as television anchors tell them (Orson Welles style) of the incredible but ""it must be true"" monsters that are attacking, of instructions scientists are giving which are horrifying (""When someone dies, there is no time for funerals or such niceties.  You must burn the body immediately, within minutes...."")

All the while, a race drama which may have been one of the first of its kind (although ""In the Heat of the Night"" preceded the film)unfolds in the house where the protagonists have sheltered themselves, and which is constantly reached into by a zombie arm or leg. An argument ensues over whether the group should remain upstairs, where escape might be possible if the zombies break through the barriers; or in the cellar (symbolic bomb shelter?) to create even more of a barrier.  Predictably, with tensions arising, even when the black and white men looked upon as the leaders seem to have come to agreement, bonds within the group prove too weak to maintain.

As for Romero's foot in the future of film, this movie set off his own franchise of zombie films.  But it's clear many newer films have tipped their hat to this one.  The Joker of Tim Burton's ""Batman"" dancing with an unconcious Vicki Vale, foreshadowing the plague that is to hit Gotham (one that definitely harkens back to this plague on the eastern seaboard in 1968.)  And how NOLD spans the Cold War arm and arm with the two most memorable (to date) versions of War of the Worlds is uncanny.  Radioactive fallout from a troubled  sattelite (in the outer space of H. G. Wells himself) causes a monstrosity that completely overwhelms humanity, that at first we have no defenses against, until we pool our collective brainpower....even then, we lose many good people who could have helped along the way.

I am especially struck by how much the cellar scenes, and the hysterics of Mr. Cooper, the ""Pro-Cellar"" leader,  remind me of the basement ""This is not an attack, it's an extermination"" scene in Spielberg's War of the Worlds this summer.  A better tribute to this film's importance in the whole of the genre could not be serendipidous.

Fear not...or rather, fear, if you seek a film for pure entertainment value, and not its role in the history of literature.  If you haven't seen it before, and sleep soundly the night after you've seen it, ask for your money back.",1163116800,,3296,4.8362989323843415
473039,5,6302484367,"I saw this movie at a drive-in theater in Memphis Tennessee when it was first released.
It was the first of it's kind and scared the bejabbers out of everybody who saw it.
I told a friend about it and invited him to go but (Believe it or not) the local censor had banned it after the first showing.
The censor was taken to court and told he couldn't ban a movie and shortly thereafter it was showing again.
The thing was so scary for it's time that the drive-in had to extend the concession period, (The break between movies so people could go to the concession stand and buy food and popcorn) because people were afraid to leave their cars.
I took friends on several occasions to see it and almost every time when the movie was over people would sit in their cars waiting for someone else to make the first move.
After a short period the first car door would open, then another and then another.
People would line up and head for the concession stand together.
Inevitably some joker somewhere in the line would loudly begin to moan and go into his staggering zombie routine.
The girls would scream and everybody would break and run for the concession stand at the same time.
Years later when my son was about ten and had a friend spending the night we rented some movies including this one and I told them they were going to see the scariest movie ever made.
Fifteen minutes into it they were bored and wanted to watch something else.

473123,5,6302484367,"Along with ""Carnival of Souls"", this movie stands out as one of the definitive black-and-white horror movies of a bygone drive-in movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before, but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also, the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio, not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.

Many people have talked about the plot in detail before, so I won't continue to belabor the details. I will mention that the movie showed something that could have only occurred pre-Watergate. At one point, the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington, reporters confront a government official about the situation, the government official tells the reporters the truth, and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens, government, and the media. Also, although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here, we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living, each time a victim is bitten, that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves, producing a problem that grows geometrically, just as vampires do.

Finally, this film has something important to say about race. Ben (Duane Jones), an African-American man, is the sole survivor of the group. Unique to 60's films, the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an African American as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. However, in the end, as morning arrives, Ben is sitting near a window of the farmhouse as the posse that is hunting down, shooting, and burning the zombies finally arrives. Happy to see his rescuers, Ben makes a movement, hoping the posse will see him. Unfortunately they do, and they shoot him dead. The film ends with Ben's body being carried from the house and being put in a pile about to be burned. He survived the whole ordeal for nothing. This begs the question, would the posse have shot first and asked questions later had they seen a white person waving from the window? Did they automatically assume - perhaps subconsciously - that there was no good reason for a black man to be in mainly white rural Ohio and therefore just assume he was a zombie? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder, but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignor.",1161648000,,3259,4.67595818815331
473124,5,6302484367,"Even if you have never seen a frame of George A. Romero's midnight cult classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), you probably know the plot from the several remakes and sequels:  a small group of people barricade themselves inside a Midwest farm house one terrifying night while an army of flesh-eating zombies try to get inside the place.  The movie was filmed in and around Pittsburgh.  It is in gloriously nightmarish black-and-white, and the low-budget definitely adds to the chills.

NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has been remade, and there are sequels to both the original film and the remake.  The original has been colorized and recut, with a prologue and happy ending added that Romero never intended.  There is only one version I know of to buy or rent--the Millenium Edition on DVD from Elite Entertainment, in B&W and remastered from the 35mm negative, running 96 minutes with no prologue and a profoundly unhappy ending.  It comes with comments from Stephen King, who notes how the original influenced a new breed of horror filmmakers, including Sam Raimi (THE EVIL DEAD trilogy) and John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN).  And Romero offers an introduction that appears to have been used on the original laserdisc about how this authorized 35mm edition looks and sounds better than even the original film did, with its 16mm drive-in circuit distribution.

The movie has an unknown cast that includes Duane Jones as a black drifter, Judith O'Dea as a catatonic white blonde, Russell Streiner as Johnny the zombie, and Karl Hardman as hard-headed Mr. Cooper.  The small group of main actors doubles as producers and crew people, and the people of Pittsburgh must have had a lot of fun playing the zombies and reporters.  Pittsburgh is my Dad's home town, so NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of my favorite contemporary horror films.  Like Herk Harvey's brilliant CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962), it has the look and feel of a nightmare that is hard to shake off.

This is also one of the most important modern horror films.  As Stephen King notes, no one survives; it is a very bleak film.  There is no hero who lives to tell the tale.  A little zombie girl takes a bite out of her mother's arm before stabbing her repeatedly with a small garden shovel in the house basement.  Zombies keep coming back from the dead, even as Mr. Cooper throws molotov cocktails at them from an open window.  This is the ultimate midnight movie and still gets a Restricted ""R"" rating four full decades after its initial release.  It must really be something with an audience because it gave me strong nightmares even when watched alone in a night bedroom.

George A. Romero himself made a superb sequel in 1980 called DAWN OF THE DEAD, with four main young people taking on motorcycle riding zombies armed with shotguns (!) in an all night suburban Pittsburgh shopping mall.  With good performances, a lively music score, color, and welcome dark comedy to go with grisly horror, DAWN OF THE DEAD is almost better than NIGHT.  Running over two hours, it is a horror epic.  As for the original NIGHT, if you like raw meat horror films with lots of gore and intense terror, this primal classic from the mind of visionary Romero should more than satisfy you.  So should DAWN OF THE DEAD.  More squeamish viewers should stay with the more subtle (I'm serious!) Alfred Hitchcock films and ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS television show episodes for Halloween season.

Bonuses on the Millenium Edition DVD include trailers/TV spots, notes by Stephen King and filmmaker George A. Romero, scenes from a lost Romero film and the history of his company The Latent Image, and the hysterically funny parody short NIGHT OF THE LIVING BREAD.

  If you are a movie buff, it's like you have to see it man.  The first time I saw it was in 1983 at a drive-in in southern Indiana.
  This DVD offers the film in a computer-colored version, however if you click to ""Special Features"", the (restored) original black & white version may be seen too.
  It is 8:00pm. Johnny (Russel Streiner) and Barbra (Judith O'Dea) travel inside the cemetery just outside of Pittsburgh.  At the request of their mother, they lay a remembrance on their father's grave.  It is getting late and a storm is brewing.  Johnny sees a man (Bill Heinzman) walking around the cemetery.  Johnny tries to scare his sister a little, but she is being upset.  As Johnny intends to get out of the cemetery because of the strange man, Barbra walks to him and the awful looking man attacks Barbra. Johnny puts up a fight, but the man manages to hit Johnny's head on a tombstone.  Now the man goes after Barbra who runs to get into the car.  It's no use.  She runs through the woods and finds a house.  The man keeps up as Barbra locks herself in the house.  The man is a zombie! A dead person who has come back to life, but decayed and dangerous.
  More zombies appear.
  A black man (Duane Jones) comes along and tries to help Barbra who is going crazy.  Ben tries to fight and kill every flesh-eating zombie he can, but their is too many resurfacing.
  Out of the cellar are two more scared people, Mr. Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) and Tom (Keith Wayne).  Also in the cellar is Judy (Judith Ridley), Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and the Cooper's daughter, Karen.
  Can these scared people survive the Night of the Living Dead?

Also in the cast: Charles Craig, George Kosana, Bill Cardille, A.C. McDonald, Samuel R. Solito, Frank Doak, Mark Ricci, Lee Hartman, Ross Harris, Steve Hutsko, Phillip Smith, Randy Burr.

Filmed in Evans City Cemetery, Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh, Zelienople, Jackson Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania.

The living dead are slow and dumb here, just as you would hope.

473217,5,6302484367,"I wasn't born yet when George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead was first released in the theaters. I've wished many-a-night that I was much older and gotten to have seen this classic of all classic horror film up on the big-screen. Night of the Living Dead simply changed the film industry forever and showed that horror has taken an uncharted road towards realism, brutality, and true horror. Horror films prior to Romero's film either took on the classic 1940's Universal look or that of the technicolor Hammer Films. NOTLD became the torchbearer of what would soon morph into the splatter and exploitation films of the following decades. The influence this film has had on horror filmmakers has yet to see the end.

Zombie films were not an unknown thing during the decades preceding Night of the Living Dead. There's always been zombie movies though they were more of the traditional Haitian voodoo variety where the zombies themselves were heavily-drugged victims forced to become slave labor for their unfeeling and sadistic masters. George Romero changed all that in 1968. Filmed at a measly budget even at that time, Romero and a company of his friends and colleagues decided to make themselves a horror movie. The premise of the film was simple. Radiation from a returning Venus probe (though later films in the series will have discounted this reason) have, for some unexplained reason, brought the recently deceased back to a semblance of life with only the most basic of motor skills. This in itself was a terrifying enough plot, but Romero ups things abit by giving these zombies a new motivation: they have an unending hunger for the flesh of the living. Night of the Living Dead marked the beginning of horror at its most extreme.

The story was heavily influenced by Richard Matheson's seminal apocalyptic vampire novel, I Am Legend, and Herschel Gordon Lewis' Blood Freaks and Two Thousand Maniacs. The former lending the theme of an impending and encroaching horror with a siege by a legion of undead being the heaviest influence. The latter influences from Lewis' work being the overt and unflinching look at exploitative violence and gore. Lewis' Blood Freaks and Two Thousand Maniacs didn't skimp in showing gore, but Romero's Night of the Living Dead was the first to actually put a decent story behind all the carnage and violence.

The film begins pleasant enough with a brother and sister on their way to a countryside cemetary to visit their dead mother. Right from the beginning the film already takes on a disturbing note. As both siblings soon come under attack from what seems like a transient. Barbara (played by Judith O'Dea), the sister, soon is fleeing for her life as their attacker continues to chase her and with her brother, Johnny, already down. The breakneck and tension-filled sequence of the first ten minutes of the film still makes my pulse pound everytime I watch it. The story soon introduces the strongest character in the film. But as strong-willed and level-headed Ben (Duane Jones in a career signature performance) seem to be he still shares the fatal flaw which would lead to fatal mistakes later on in the film. The rest of the cast soon follow Ben's appearance. There's Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and their injured daughter Karen (Kyra Schon). The rest of the cast in the farmhouse is rounded out by local couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). With the farmhouse gradually being surrounded by a growing horde of undead attracted by the noise of their work to secure the building, one would think the group would work together and hand in hand to try and survive the encroaching night until help arrives. But group dynamics within the group begins in conflict and slowly escalates into open conflict and self-preservation without any regard for their fellows.

That infighting and the inability for the group to work together in concert and harmony became Night of the Living Dead's strongest message and observation about the human condition in times of great stress and upheaval. The characters were all fully realized and full of complixity that's rare in horror films of its generation. It's that attention to realism in how the characters were written which gives the conflict between the survivors such impact on viewer. As much as one would say, after seeing the group disintigrate, that they're stupid and idiotic it's difficult to admit that given the same situation others wouldn't fall to the same infighting, backstabbing and counter-productive behavior as the people did in the farmhouse. Romero's damning commentary on humanity's inability to work together has led to strife and conflict throughout the ages, and Night of the Living Dead points this out as brutal, blunt and matter-factly as possible.

The horrific nature of Romero's film became even more horrific because of a decision based primarily on the economics of making a film. Color film stock was already available in the 1960's but was still considered quite expensive to use. Only the major studios and those independent filmmakers with a large financial backing could afford to use color film stock. So, Romero decided to fall back on the abundant supply of black and white film which was still in heavy use in the film industry. It helped that Romero's work as a documentary filmmaker in the past made it easier for him to procure film for his project. This decision also gave NOTLD its signature, cinema-verite look at horror of the mundane. The grainy look of the film footage gave the film an immediacy only seen and realized with the 8mm home movies of that generation. Add to that the economical and flawless editing by Romero with the minimalist, bass and reverb heavy soundtrackm and the film took on a life of its own. Night of the Living Dead's creeping dread and horror became so heavy that I'm surprised there weren't more complaints of people walking our of this film when it was first released. The horror in this film was palpable to the point one could feel it days after one has finished watching the film.

There really wasn't much to complain about this film. Horror aficionados now had a film that went beyond the exploitive nature of the genre. The film also helped usher in the next generation of filmmakers who saw that film didn't just have to be all about entertainment, but could also be used as a platform to express one's beliefs about the social, political and economical nature of the world at that moment. Night of the Living Dead had it all. It spoke to filmgoers young and old that the age of fun and silly, fantastical horror was over and that a new wave of horror in all its realistic glory was about to descend on the populace. Night of the Living Dead didn't look away once the violence began. Flesh was shown being ripped off the limbs of their victims. Long ropes of intestines and quivering mass of organs were seen being handled and devoured. This was unheard of at that time and it were kids as young as 11-12 yeards old who first saw this on the big screen since the film was released initially as part of Saturday matinees.

1968 has gone down as the flashpoint for the beginning of a new era in filmmaking. Night of the Living Dead didn't just influence horror filmmakers, but filmmakers in general. Its not a surprise that Romero's night of the Living Dead has been found its way into the Smithsonian National Film Registry as a film which heavily influenced the art of filmmaking. It's been almost years since the film first shocked audience worldwide and four decades removed it still shocks audiences seeing it for the first time and still delights devotees of the film. Night of the Living Dead marks the arrival of not just a new era in filmmaking and horror, but the arrival of a genuine, guerilla film auteur seen by fans and critics alike as a master of his craft.",1154563200,4,7903,4.83234859675037
473218,5,6302484367,"Cult horror movies are the like zombies -- they don't die, but stick around giving chills to whomever encounters them. And two excellent ones are in this collection: zombie frightfest ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and atmospheric ""Carnival of Souls."" Warning: Do not watch after dark.

""Night of the Living Dead"" starts when a crashed satellite starts emitting radiation, which causes the dead to rise out of their graves to devour the living. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) is visiting a grave with her brother -- when suddenly a shambling, dead-faced man murders him, and chases her down the road to a farmhouse.

But she's not alone -- a kindly man named Ben (Duane Jones), a young couple, and a family are also hiding there. The refugees barricade themselves for protection -- but now there are hundreds of zombies closing in. They must fight with fire and their wits... but it may not be enough.

""Carnival of Souls"" was Herk Harvey's one and only horror film, despite making a lot of educational ones. Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) and her two pals agree to a car race -- but are run off the road. Mary survives, emerges from the water, and walks to the nearby town to begin her new job as a church organist,

But something about the town -- and herself -- is horribly wrong. She seems to be haunted by a creepy, ghoulish man, and her personality has become distant. What's weirder, she has become obsessed by a pavilion and is seeing feverish hallucinations. These visions hold the key to what happened to her on the day of the crash...

Both movies are excellent examples of their own genre, made on shoestring budgets with unknown actors, but which became classics of the genre. George A. Romero created the blueprint for zombie movies, while Harvey's only fictional movie is a Poe-esque suspense film, full of dreamy suspense.

Romero creates a nightmarish, claustrophobic atmosphere in his movie, where no matter where you go, you're trapped -- and the humans might kill you if the zombies don't. Harvey has the opposite effect, with his empty carnies and stretches of featureless plains -- here there is plenty of space, but it's empty and soulless.

But one thing they have in common is total originality and eerie cinematography, whether feeling like a dream or a nightmare. And each movie has a twist ending -- ""Carnival's"" is a twist that is slowly built up to, and experienced moviegoers will see coming, while ""Night's"" is a shocking one, but reflective of the violent times when it was filmed.

Duane Jones is the heroic one in ""Night,"" as well as being the strongest performance -- his Ben is not perfect, and has his own secrets, but he is quick to action and very intelligent. Considering this was made in 1968, points go to Romero for having an African-American hero. Hilgoss has a slightly less compelling performance, but that is because Mary herself is detached from the world around her. Her fear and confusion feel very real.

Two eerie horror movies, with little money and lots of talent. ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Carnival of Souls"" are must-haves for fans of classic, groundbreaking horror.",1153267200,4,3118,4.802238805970149
473219,1,6302484367,"This is a majorly disappointing dvd. The transfer is poor; with the image cropped slightly and white tones that are too grey (leading many to think the movie is murkier than it is). These complaints are pretty much moot when you consider the real failure of this dvd. THE ORIGINAL FILM IS NOT ON IT.

  This disc includes two different versions of the film but NEITHER are the original. The new extended cut was made without George Romero's involvement...actually lets not even debate that. The fact of the matter is the new cut is really poor. The new opening for the film is frustrating, and all the footage that has been added of the preacher is tedious and annoying.

  Many people have thought that the other version on the disc is the original, and i will admit i made that mistake. It is not. It is a version of the movie ""trimmed"" by the producers to make it move a little faster. If you can live with this edit, thats cool. I want the original film.

  Let's also mention the second disc including the score. I've rarely heard a more inappropriate theme for a movie like this (it is not the original soundtrack). I once bought a dollar store version of cabinet of dr. caligari that had loops of circus music put under it. I feel similarly raped by this.

  The only good thing is that this is a limited edition, which will hopefully keep it out of the hands of most people.

  Personally, i recommend the Elite Entertainment millenium edition, which was made with Romero's involvement.",1150416000,3,1494,4.543071161048689

Quick, do yourself and true film fans a favour, GO FIND THE MILLENIUM EDITION OF THIS FILM, AND BUY THAT!
THAT version IS the definitive DVD version of the original classic.
Clean images, clean audio, great supplements and commentary.
THIS version?
Well, let me put it this way.
You will appreciate the 30th Anniversary Edition of NOTLD only if you think it's okay for the guy who built the frame for the Mona Lisa to repaint it with lousy colors.
Or if you think the guy who delivered the blank tapes to Capitol and Apple should legally be able to recut and remix all of the Beatles tunes.
This DVD is a travesty.
John Russo has no talent to make a NEW film (a quick glance at Children of the Dead will bear this out), so he continues to ride the wave of the original NOTLD's classic status to give himself permission to destroy the very elements which made it a classic in the first place.
To remove 17 minutes of original footage is enough of a crime.
To replace those scenes with 18 minutes of amateurish, poorly acted and poorly conceived 'new scenes' is the bottom of the barrel stupidity.
Add Scott 'Anton LeVay-as-Preacher' Licina's horrible acting and derivative, irritating and ineffective score, and you've got a recipe for a lousy DVD.
Is the picture good? Yes, but since this is NOT the original film, it's hard to praise the technical merits of this DVD.
It saddens me to think there are people who did NOT see the original NOTLD before this dismal failure was released, and may think THIS is the definitive version.
It is most assuredly not.

Still though, I just do not see anything too particularly enthralling about zombies.  I mean, they are zombies with zombiesqe movements and zombiesh attitudes.  This means they are slow and boring.

This review is for the ""Millennium Edition"" --AND ONLY THE MILLENNIUM EDITION.

Buy it. Watch it. Keep it. Treasure it!

Here is ""my"" review -- I humbly admit I cannot write this any better.

With all the essential attributions...

From the Millennium Edition's back cover, and written by George A. Romero:

--

The Original Classic

I am delighted that there is finally a ""collector's edition"" version of Night Of The Living Dead, and I am particularly pleased that the video transfer was so affectionately supervised by people who care about the quality of the original film.

Night has had an erratic distribution pattern. Even its original theatrical release was launched with film prints that were often dark and muddy, prompting journalists to criticize the ""amateurish visual style"" and to speculate that the film was originally photographed in 16mm.

Now that this excellent copy has been made from the original 35mm negatives, I hope viewers will be able to better appreciate the intention of the high-contrast images and understand that their starkness evokes, rather than undermine, the necessary sense of ""presence"" which, I believe, gives the film its teeth (no pun intended).

Night Of The Living Dead was made by a small group of very dedicated individuals whose contributions can now be seen and heard more clearly than in any previously released version in any format.

I thank those individuals, many of them still good friends, for their labors. I'm sorry it took so long for those labors to be showcased in a form that so closely approximates those first oh-so-enthusiastic screenings of the sound-interlocked work-print at The Latent Image, in Pittsburgh. I'm grateful that we can now have a good copy of this film in our personal libraries, and that viewers, new and old, can see it as it was meant to be seen.

...Stay Scared!

In-House Review; DVD Empire dot com:

 History has given us few films that have been more abused than NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. It's a classic horror movie that ranks in the top five of the top ten scariest horror films ever made and yet it gets no respect because it's damn near impossible to find a decent version of it.

 The original filmmakers were rookies at the game and they didn't secure the rights and as such, it fell into the public domain, which meant that anybody with ten bucks and a video recorder could make and market their edition. The result was a good film that went to waste in the early ""get rich quick"" days of the video market. These days are now being duplicated in the early days of the DVD business because you can go to a store and find no less than eight different versions of the same film. Make no mistake though, they are sheer crap (and before anybody says it, no version is worse an offender than the supposed restoration of the film that inserted new scenes into it. That film was a CRIME!)

 But all of this is really just leading up to the fact that the Millennium edition by Elite is gorgeous. I was taken aback with the opening frames of the film because you see the car driving up and you can make out every detail on the film. I was even reading some of the names off the headstones.

 Later the film really shows the difference between this pristine version and the others when we first get sight of Ben as he comes into the farmhouse. It's a terrific use of shadows and the quality is jaw dropping beautiful.

 But, I'm not here to give a lecture on the use of shadows in the film. There are those who understand it far better than me, and I invite you to check out some of the essays written on the subject. I'm a movie fan and so I just look at the fact that this is the film that broke new ground in the way that it presented a cast inside a no win situation and it never let up throughout the entire film. That being said, if you don't know the story of the hapless people that get trapped inside a farmhouse with a herd of hungry zombies outside, then this is a perfect time for us to introduce you to this classic film.

 The disc is perfect. It shows the film in it's original 1.33:1 broadcast standard (restored from a reworked 35mm negative) and the audio is a newly remastered 5.1 dub mix (in THX) which brings out the nuance of sounds that hint at the unrelenting horror.

 Special features begin with a newly remastered version of the satire ""night of the living bread"" which is a clever short. It also gives us a wealth of information on the making of the film. The disc includes the original script, an examination of the original Image 10 Company, and examples of the ads they worked on prior to this film. We also get interviews with the cast and crew including Judith Ridley and Duane Jones.

 Also included are dozens of collectible stills and examples of poster art from all over the world. Many of the cast members have contributed their own scrapbooks to this disc and the result is everything you might have wanted to know about the film.

 The film also includes samples and quotes from the infamous unfinished Romero film ""There's always Vanilla."" And it has liner notes from Stephen King.

 Bottom Line: A disc like this brings back the days of laserdisc when we all looked forward to a collection like this. It's a perfect look at an almost perfect film and this collection deserves high fives across the board!

473294,3,6302484367,"I was always a little on the squeamish side, and as a child, I never had much use for horror movies. I don't think it was until my mid- to late teens that I even started seeing very many on any kind of regular basis--and then mostly because my friends wanted to go.  Nonconformist that I was, I tagged along.

Well, it wasn't just that:  I should give myself some credit.  There was already some criticism appearing in the mid- to late 60s about how horror movies were a coded (or maybe not-so-coded)commentary on our times. What with all those references to radiation and all.  And some were supposed to be allegories.  And you could do Freudian interpretations of vampire or zombie flicks.  So budding intellectual that I was, I could surely find rationalization for tagging along with my friends to horror flicks.

And lo, I made the discovery: they weren't quite as scary as all that.  A good many of them were downright campy.

NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was one I did avoid, however.  I don't recall if others in my crowd attended, but I'd read and  heard enough about it to put me off.  For about 35 years, in fact.

But this past Halloween, I went on a scary movie binge, of sorts.  And since, this low budget shocker was on just about everyone's list of horror movie ""must sees,""  I finally saw it.  This despite the fact that the cover on the library copy I borrowed clearly said, ""Not For the Squeamish.""  And Leonard Maltin had warned ""Don't watch this alone.""  Well, I'm  still kind of squeamish and I watched it alone (if you don't count my cat Zsa Zsa) and lived to tell the tale.

It's pretty clear why the movie shocked audiences in 1968.  By today's ghoulish standards, it's nothing too outrageous.  But intestine devouring, bone chomping zombies were something of a novelty in '68.  Of course, this was the era when the Vietnam war was being beamed into suburban homes every night on network news.  And it was the year that RFK and MLK were assassinated.  The Summer of Love was the year before.  The movie was filmed slightly before the Manson murders--but it's random violence and (SPOILER WARNING, in case you couldn't guess) its laying to waste of all its major characters was pretty emblematic of the tumultuous era.

But wasn't I just being a little snide about horror movies reflecting the fears and axieties of their era?  Well, yes, but it IS true, on a number of levels.  Radiation is once again at the root of the horror.  Random, mindless (literally) violence rends the fabric of everyday petit bourgeois life, and every other kind of life come to think of it.

And it's all on television.  At least until the power goes out.",1131321600,,2654,4.555084745762712
473295,5,6302484367,"I just don't know what it is about this movie that grabs my attention. It doesn't matter what you do, where you run, or where you hide. They are there! There is no escape! They won't stop til you are dead! The original 1968 Night of The Living Dead is a true horror masterpiece. The zombies are...awesome, to say the least. When a few characters are killed by an exploding car, the film continues with a grotesque display of the zombies eating the left over body parts. The actors (especially Duane Jones) did a wonderful job, especially since this was their first movie! The ending, in my opinion, is probably the best ending in any movie of the genre. I won't spoil it for you, but even the grizzly images during the credits will make you think.

As for the 30th anniversary edition, I advise everyone who is a fan of this film, or someone who has never seen this film before to avoid it as much as possible. They add a new beginning with two guys driving the casket of the first zombie (the first one we see in the cemetery played by Bill Heinzman) from the prison where he was just executed to the cemetery where he's to be interred. A cheesy bald priest and the parents of the little girl that the dead guy apparently killed are there waiting for the body. The girl's father wants to see his body to make sure...and then spits on it and leaves with the girl's mother. The dead guy stirs, gets up, and bites the priest...then he wanders away leading us to the REAL beginning of the movie. They took out the whole ""driving up to the cemetery"" stuff from the original, and begin the older footage with Barbara and Johnny stopping and getting out.

During the film, they've added a car crash family of zombies, as well as some zombies from the Diner where Ben came from (all played by family members and friends of the ""film makers""). Some feeding stuff...nothing big.

Finally, at the end, after Ben is shot, they superimpose a ""One Year Later"" and show some reporter going to visit the cheesy priest in the hospital. He didn't die from his wound, because of ""prayer"" and crap like that. Oh, and he has a dog named ""Mewshew"" (not sure if that's the spelling...but that's definitely the pronunciation) that he has so that, in case he DOES turn into a zombie, he can chow down on it rather than some person who's near by.

Anyway, it's HORRIBLE. The acting of the new people is just pathetic...especially the priest (who just happened to do the new score for the movie...which was equally horrible). Also, they said how they ""seamlessly"" intercut the old footage with the new, and how Bill Heinzman looked exactly how he looked back then due to the great make up FX...but that was utter *beep* Very sad. Very pathetic. Avoid it.

The original Night of The Living Dead is a true horror classic that should not be missed. Avoid the 30th anniversary edition!

473296,5,6302484367,"I bought this movie with another movie in one of those cheap movie bins at places like Walmart. When I watched this movie for the first time I was shivering through it. I could't even eat popcorn and watch this movie at the same time.

  If I wanted to watch a movie I wouldn't even touch the box I was so creeped out. I wouldn't be able to sleep from fear of a zombie walking through the door.

  The black and white version adds to the atmosphere of the movie and I thought made it more creepy.",1130457600,4,496,4.061855670103093
473297,5,6302484367,"Once upon a time a young girl and her brother traveled three hours from home to place flowers on the grave of their father. The brother started teasing his sister, telling her in a creepy voice, ""They're coming to get you, Barbara."" However, the joke ended up being on him because they were coming to get Barbara, only they got him first.

I first saw ""Night of the Living Dead"" when I came home one afternoon and discovered that the Iowa City Public Library Channel on cable was showing the film. I have to admit, I was rather surprised that this cult classic horror film would be on at a time when kids could come home and discover it on television (one of the living dead is naked and they do like to eat human flesh), but Iowa is a state that thinks caucuses are a good way of selecting presidential nominees, so what can I say? But this is a horror movie that is even scary in the daytime with all the lights on.

""The Night of the Living Dead"" is a horror classic, which is rather surprising when you take into account that director George A. Romero made the film in 1968 for $114,000 without a cast of first time actors (extras who playing the zombies were paid $1 and a t-shirt that said ""I was a zombie on Night of the Living Dead""). Filmed in black and white with Romero as the cinematographer, this film has a technical proficiency that is missing from other low-budget classics like ""Dementia 13"" and ""Carnival of Souls."" You can take or leave the various sequels to this film, but this one has to be on everyone's Top 10 list when it comes to horror films.  Romero has upped the ante on the social satire along with the blood and guts in his next three zombie films, including the recent ""Land of the Dead,"" but this first one remains special.

The horror comes from the situation and the simple effectiveness of the slow moving, silent zombies in their growing numbers, their arms reaching out to find human flesh to eat. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) runs to an abandoned house, where she is joined by Ben (Duane Jones). After fending off the first attack of the living dead, they discover five more people hiding in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife, Helen (Marilyn Eastman), and their daughter (Kyra Schon), along with a young couple, Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry wants to hide out in the basement, but refuses to be trapped down there, and the two spend more time arguing about what to do than doing anything. They listen to the radio and watch the TV, learning that the dead are rising to eat the living, and try to figure out a way of getting out of the death trap in which they find themselves. Meanwhile, the little girl in the basement is getting weaker and weaker.

The only real weakness in the film is the attempt to explain why the dead are walking around as flesh-eating ghouls (which is, I believe, redundant), which has something to do with a satellite and scientific mumbo-jumbo that really does not mean anything to the people trying to survive against the growing horde of zombies. Fortunately, the ""why"" does not matter in this story; just the ""how"" in terms of taking these creatures down. Besides, if anything clinches this one it is the end of the film, both with its final twist, and the use of grainy still photographs to show the end of the tale. Few horror movies, whatever their budgets, have an ending this memorable.",1130371200,4,3392,4.508943089430894
473298,5,6302484367,Night of the Living Dead by George Romero is a horror classic and not only that but its also the one that started the zombie movies!!!!!!!! I think that this classic will be treasured always and to me it has enough scares in it!!!!!! When dead people won't stay dead its up to this group of survivors to stay away from the dead or else they become one of them!!!!!! Like i said before Night of the Living Dead has been out for years and when they remade this one it was not as good as this one here and if you love horror movies then go out and pick up this true horror classic for you dvd collection!!!!!!,1129852800,,606,4.100840336134453
473349,5,6302484367,"Ah, here we are. We have the first of four great films from the mind of George A. Romero. While LAND OF THE DEAD is not as classic as this beauty, all four of Romero's 'DEAD' films hold true to the zombie genre. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was the film that truly changed the horror genre, and Romero knew he had it made when he graced the movie audience with sheer terror.

While revolutionary, this film also features some B-grade acting (Duane Jones as the lead hero, really was much better than most actors of this genre's heyday) and shocking gore effects that are quite gruesome. The color version of this film doesn't change anything at all, and really the black and white version is more terrifying because it's darker, and it creates more menace. The zombies are relentless; the characters are cornered like frightened dogs; and the gore is not short of supply. People are trapped in an abandoned home trying to find a way to keep the undead out, but the zombies are relentless and will stop at nothing to feast on warm human flesh. The movie's black & white documentary style innovation is key to the effective suspense and terror that ultimately breathes in this movie.

It doesn't hurt that the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD today is still heralded as one of the classic horror films of all time, and it's sequels are almost as powerful, but none of them will come close to the sheer terror and power of this one.

Romero's legacy will live on for years to come, and all the 'DEAD' films will hold a place in the ultimate shrine of the horror genre. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a must-own film, a testament to the power that we, the cult following, gave to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.",1129593600,2,1686,4.449838187702265
473350,5,6302484367,"Before this film, Zombies in films were just slaves or people in a trans. That all changed in 1968, when George A. Romero brung us Night Of The Living Dead. A film about 7 people who barricade themselves in a farmhouse, so the walking dead won't get them. But, the thing that made this film different from other zombie fils before this is the living dead have a hunger for warm human flesh.

Since then, Zombies in films have been eating flesh or eating something that's part of the human body like Brains. The film does have some corny dialog and some corny acting from some of the actors in this film. But, you can look through that and just have a great time watching this classic.

Not only has this film changed Zombies, but it's changed a lot in horror too. George A. Romero definitley showed his talent when he made this film. And still from this day, no director who has made Zombie films has done better than Romero's Dead Saga.",1129420800,,937,4.410404624277457
473351,5,6302484367,"I don't like horror films, but Night of the Living Dead is an exception. It's about survival - a stark story in stark black and white. The fear and tension slowly and inexorably rise and peak until the shocking and unforgettable ending. The goriness is palpable but understated.

473352,5,6302484367,"PLOT: The film opens up on a cloudy day in a Pennsylvania cemetary. Two siblings, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (co-producer Russell Streiner), are visiting the grave of their late father. Suddenly a crazed man attacks them and smashes Johnny's head on a tombstone. Barbara runs for her life, with the wild-eyed man chasing behind her. She finds shelter at a nearby farmhouse. She finds a corpse upstairs and is just about to run out of the house when an African-American man named Ben (Duane Jones) arrives on the scene. More of these strange people arrive at the house and Ben quickly beats them to death. He does his best to try and calm down Barabara. The two, thinking that they are alone, are suddenly surprised to find 5 people hiding in the cellar. They are a young couple, Tommy and Judy (Keith Wayne and Judith Ridley), an older husband and wife, Harry and Helen Cooper (Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman), and their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon). Karen was bitten by one of the ""things"" and was seriously ill. The group of people don't exactly get along very well and an awful amount of tension builds up between Ben and Cooper.  Their only hope is to get to the farm's gas pumps and fill Ben's truck with enough gas to make it to safety. The path to the pumps however is blocked by a rising population of ""things"" who are out to get the people inside the farmhouse.

COMMENTS: This is the film that started it all: the modern zombie genre. Before this film came out, zombies were just slaves of vodoo priests or aliens. This film created the modern zombie: a reanimated corpse that feeds on human flesh. This is the film that shot horror maestro George A. Romero to fame. The film is a reflection of 60s society: the Vietnam War, The Cold War, the fight for Civil Rights, etc. Romero showed us that ""they are us and we are them."" Humans are just as bad as the zombies. The people inside the farmhouse can't cooperate and always just end up fighting with each other. The film was a low-budget independent film shot in black & white. This is very effective. It didn't even get national distribution, but it ultimately became one of the biggest cult films of all time. The original title was ""Night of the Flesh-Eaters."" Romero later got a call from a lawyer proclaiming that the title had already been used and that his film would have to be retitled. After renaming it, the production company failed to copyright the film under it's new name, and subsequently the film was shown all over the country with none of the royalties being sent to Mr. Romero or his partners. They have been hunting these people down for over 30 years. The film was remade in 1990, with Romero reworking his script. Long-time Romero collaborator and EFX wizard Tom Savini was hired to direct it. It is very faithful to the original, with the exception of a new twist ending. This was also a chance for the original filmmakers to finally get some royalties off of the ""Night Of The Living Dead"" name. The original film was also followed by some very successful sequels: ""Dawn Of the Dead"" (1978), ""Day Of The Dead"" (1985), and ""Land Of The Dead"" (2005), all directed by Romero. Romero's films inspired several other filmmakers including Lucio Fulci [""Zombie"" (1979)], Dan O'Bannon [""The Return Of The Living Dead"" (1985)] and Danny Boyle [""28 Days Later"" (2002)]. Since the film isn't copyrighted, there are several different DVD editions floating around out there. This particular edition features the film in technicolor and the original black & white (I prefer the latter). It also features commentary by Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000, ""Separated at Death"": celebrity zombie game, and vintage horror trailers.",1127347200,,3713,4.719568567026194
473353,5,6302484367,"This post is misplaced,for that I am sorry,but I don't know where else to turn. I am from New Jersey,and I worked in a video store in the late 80's early 90's(not blockbuster ,but sort of a ""big choice"" if your a kevin smith fan).When I worked there our cult movie section was extensive(we had 2 copies of the talking  ""frankenhooker"" VHS package that said ""want a date"" in a shrill voice whenever it was touched),and it contained a version of this romero film I have been unable to locate for years. The chain is out of buisness or I would have bought the copy they had.

Its title was roughly ""The Night of, the day of, the dawn  of, the  return of, the revenge of , the bloodsucking mutant monster freaks"" and it was essentially the black and white film version of night of the living dead with a mystery science theatre 3000 style audio track. The box claimed that george did not copyright the black and white print becuase of his plans to reshoot in color ,but he did copyright the dialoge.

473354,5,6302484367,"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of the last and best of the low-budget ""Radiation Is Coming To Get Us"" genre of films that came out of the 1950s. Although director George Romero has spent his career trying to replicate this film he has never succeeded and realistically never will.

Shot in grainy, low definition black and white with a muddy soundtrack, peopled with actors nobody ever heard of before or since, and done on a budget of about $82.47, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has all the production quality of an 8mm home movie, which is what makes it so effective.

The storyline is simple: A mixed group of terrified people are trapped in a remote farmhouse trying to escape from a horde of dead ghouls, who have been reanimated by a radiation burst from an exploding space probe. The ghouls are ""deadicated"" (pardon the pun) to killing and eating the living, who then become ghouls themselves.

The acting quality is unprofessional and brilliantly sincere. The tensions within the group are at a fever pitch. Barbara is a terrified girl, almost zombielike herself from shock after being attacked by a ghoul at the outset of the story. Ben is a competent, driven man fully committed to staying alive. He happens to be a black man, which although never specifically mentioned, underlies the animosity between himself and Harry Cooper, a disagreeable middle-aged coward who bullies his wife, Helen and daughter Karen, and tries to control everyone else in the house. The group is rounded out by Tom and Judy, a local young couple. Without meaning to, Romero created a 1968 period piece on social and race relations. Life and living is reduced to the most primal of conditions in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.

The ghouls are frightening in their silence and inexorable craving for flesh. The scenes of them feeding are utterly grotesque, and have revolted reviewers and audiences alike since this film was first released.

So much of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has become part of subsequent moviemaking dynamics that it is hard to imagine the impact this movie originally had.

Best viewed on Halloween or on a stormy night, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD never fails to terrify and entertain. Viewers are best advised to stay away from the remastered full-frills editions as unnecessary; for sheer impact, nothing is better than the bargain dollar DVD release or the spotty budget VCR version.",1126310400,2,2382,4.84029484029484

473356,3,6302484367,"Much has been said about ""Night of the Living Dead"" for the last 37 years. Of course it's one of the classic horror flicks that will be remembered for a very long time. It's not just fun (in a ""horror"" meaning of this word) it has a social message, it was rather important for that time and now also - I'm talking about the whole Romero's trilogy (quadrilogy now) - you all now about its anti-racist, anti-consumer and so on aspects. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is still topical. BUT.

Old movies sometimes are hard to percept today. They seem a little bit naive and funny. The same thing I guess happened to Romero's classic. Nowdays it's not that scary and shocking as it was in 1968. Maybe I'm wrong and some people still find it the way it was then. Well, good for them. But I think there are some who think like me and who can't watch old films without making allowance for time. I watched it three times and each one I found myself being a little bored.

Again I repeat it is a great movie of a great cinematographic and panhuman value, it's in my top 10 of the greatest horror flicks of all time, but I doubt you'll be watching it for a couple times a year. Maybe two or three times like me. Tom Savini's remake look much more up-to-date.

What I have no doubt about is that it's neccessary to have it in your collection even if you are not an avid horror fan. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is one of the movies that changed cinematography forever and although it might not be perceived as 40 years ago, it's still worth time and money.",1125964800,2,1539,4.263698630136986
473357,5,6302484367,"In 1968 George A. Romero and John A. Russo co-wrote a little film called Night of the Flesh Eaters, which ultimately became Night of the Living Dead.

George A. Romero directed this black and white bleak and suspensful film about dead bodies who get up and walk around and eat the flesh of the living.

Night of the Living Dead is not your regular run of the mill basement made $3.25 zombie flick. Night of the Living Dead is a devastating satire displaying the African-American lead as the iscolated outsider. Once you have seen the hunt scene towards the end of the film, and know about the freedom marches and civil rights struggles in those days, you will understand excactly what I am talking about.

Night of the Living Dead has a nice patch job of music, great atmosphere, characters, and really gives the tone of dread and chlostrophobia.

Although films like White Zombie (1933, Bela Lugosi) were out before Night of the Living Dead, there was never a ""zombie"" film like it and there was never one after it either. Night of the Living Dead remains an all time classic American film. It is part of film history, which makes it part of American history, being that movies play such a huge role in our culture.",1125792000,,1216,4.589861751152074
473428,5,6302484367,"For a film that is widely considered a horror classic, ""Night of the Living Dead"" has been handled with surprisingly poor care in the home video market over the years.

For the longest time, the film was generally only available on VHS copies that could often be found in the bargain bins of your local video store.  The reason for the cheap price became apparent after viewing.  The picture quality of many of these editions was so poor that viewing them made you feel as if you were watching the movie through dirty aquarium water.

With the advent of DVD there have been ocassional first rate packages out there but more often than not the film was still mishandled.  Then there were the ""revisionist"" versions like the colorized version or the 30th Anniversary Edition that inserted newly shot footage into the movie.  While I've not seen either of those versions I've heard enough bad things about them to know that they should be avoided.

But this""Millenium Edition"" edition gives hardcore fans of the film, what they've pined for for years:  a first rate edition of the film on DVD that also comes loaded with a host of excellent extras.  It says a lot that  director George Romero himself even blesses this version in his signed liner notes on the back of the DVD's packaging.

As for the film itself, as far as I can tell it's never looked better and probably didn't even look this good when it was shown in theaters upon its release in 1968.  This copy was made from the original negatives and the result is a DVD transfer that is pristine.

Though many ""consider the sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead"" the highwater mark of the Dead Quadrilogy, there's no getting around the fact ""Night""  not only remains the scariest of the series but also stands the test of time as one of the most terrifying films ever made.  This is only emphasized by the superior quality of this DVD.  Romero's use of shadows and lighting has never evoked this much dread or had such powerful impact.

Even if you've seen the film, countless times, watching this DVD is almost like viewing it for the very first time.

Then there is a plethora of extras which include two commentary tracks.  Best among them commentary from Romero and other key production personnell which offers surprising insight on the making of the film and on the guerilla film-making style Romero employed.

In fact, this commentary track along with the original shooting script provide a fascinating look at the origins of the film which, believe it or not, was originally conceived as a ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" type space invader flick crossed with hot-rodding teenager movie.  Nevertheless, though the film was shot just outside of Romero's native Pittsburgh with no Hollywood stars and a budget that was microscopic even by 1968 standards it went on to become one of the most successful independent films of all time.

Also of interest is a historical perspective on The Latent Image, a production company which Romero co-founded initially to produce commercials before branching infto film.  Copies of some of those commercials are also included along with footage from ""There's Always Vanilla,"" a romance movie which Romero shot but never released.

Taken altogether, the results are a superior DVD package that not only presents a great horror classic the way it was meant to be seen but also an amazing look at the roots of the film and the director behind it.

In fact, I recently bought and watched this DVD after seeing Romero's latest ""Dead"" film, ""Land of the Dead"" in theaters.  It was interesting to note that even with  the ""new film's semi-big Hollywood stars, color photography, and massive special effects budget, ""Night"" was, far and away, a much more powerful viewing experience.

After doing so, my advice to Romero is this:  George, if you ever do another ""Dead"" movie remember that what made ""Night,"" ""Dawn,"" and yes even the much-maligned ""Day of the Dead"" classics for the ages wasn't an ""R""-Rating, Hollywood slickness, and corporate backing.

It was the punk rock-like, ""do it yourself ethic.""  That spirit that said ""F@#( it!  We're going to make this movie the way we want by any means necessary.""  This ethic has arguably inspired even non-horror directors as diverse as Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez.

In other words, stay out of Hollywood and go back to Pittsburgh.",1124755200,5,4391,4.834002677376171

473430,5,6302484367,"Once upon a time a young girl and her brother traveled three hours from home to place flowers on the grave of their father. The brother started teasing his sister, telling her in a creepy voice, ""They're coming to get you, Barbara."" However, the joke ended up being on him because they were coming to get Barbara, only they got him first.

I first saw ""Night of the Living Dead"" when I came home one afternoon and discovered that the Iowa City Public Library Channel on cable was showing the film. I have to admit, I was rather surprised that this cult classic horror film would be on at a time when kids could come home and discover it on television (one of the living dead is naked and they do like to eat human flesh), but Iowa is a state that thinks caucuses are a good way of selecting presidential nominees, so what can I say? But this is a horror movie that is even scary in the daytime with all the lights on.

""The Night of the Living Dead"" is a horror classic, which is rather surprising when you take into account that director George A. Romero made the film in 1968 for $114,000 without a cast of first time actors (extras who playing the zombies were paid $1 and a t-shirt that said ""I was a zombie on Night of the Living Dead""). Filmed in black and white with Romero as the cinematographer, this film has a technical proficiency that is missing from other low-budget classics like ""Dementia 13"" and ""Carnival of Souls."" You can take or leave the various sequels to this film, but this one has to be on everyone's Top 10 list when it comes to horror films.

The horror comes from the situation and the simple effectiveness of the slow moving, silent zombies in their growing numbers, their arms reaching out to find human flesh to eat. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) runs to an abandoned house, where she is joined by Ben (Duane Jones). After fending off the first attack of the living dead, they discover five more people hiding in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife, Helen (Marilyn Eastman), and their daughter (Kyra Schon), along with a young couple, Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry wants to hide out in the basement, but refuses to be trapped down there, and the two spend more time arguing about what to do than doing anything. They listen to the radio and watch the TV, learning that the dead are rising to eat the living, and try to figure out a way of getting out of the death trap in which they find themselves. Meanwhile, the little girl in the basement is getting weaker.

The only real weakness in the film is the attempt to explain why the dead are walking around as flesh-eating ghouls (which is, I believe, redundant), which has something to do with a satellite and scientific mumbo-jumbo that really does not mean anything to the people trying to survive against the growing horde of zombies. Fortunately, the ""why"" does not matter in this story; just the ""how"" in terms of taking these creatures down. Besides, if anything clinches this one it is the end of the film, both with its final twist, and the use of grainy still photographs to show the end of the tale. Few horror movies, whatever their budgets, have an ending this memorable.",1122422400,2,3194,4.511226252158894
473431,5,6302484367,"Plot: Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russel Streiner) are visiting an old graveyard as they do every year for their passed loved one. But this time, they encounter a crazed man (Bill Hinzman) who attacks them both (indeed, he is a walking corpse in need of a good meal). Fleeing from the scene without her injured borther (did she have a choice? geez, Hinzman was creepy) she finds a small house as her hiding place. Already inside, though, is Ben (Duane Jones). He has had an encounter with a few of ""those things"" himself. Before long, the isolated strangers discover by radio and television that the unburied dead are coming back to life and feeding on the living -- most likely from a recent radioactive explosion. But in the long run, who cares how they came to life? They are killing the living and consuming their flesh! What can be done, if anything, to stop this madness from growing and growing and growing? Time runs out as the zombies' numbers increase and the gang find any sense of safety hard to come by. Is there any hope? Or will they all perish in the sea of the dead awaiting their sweet'n'salty fresh carcasses?

If you are like me, you can't stand those newer zombie flicks that have come out within the past decade or so. Sure, they have some good horror and suspense, but come on! They're nothing compared to the original zombie recipe perfected by Romero in 1968 with ""Night Of The Living Dead"". If corpses were suddenly rising from their deaths in an incompetent army of cannibalistic horrors, would they be faster than a speeding bullet? I think not! That is one of the best aspects of older zombies films: the zombies are creepily slow and lethargic. They are corpses in a mobilized trance, hungry for your flesh. Nowdays, all I see are super-corpses running frantically amoung several teenage idiots with all of the cliches we are tired of to make a two-hour bore-fest. Not this. NOTLD is a truly original take on the zombie invasion concept -- and it's still the best. It not only presented the old-fashioned dead folks we love to watch creep along the black and white screen, but it also introduced a feeling of pure nihilism. The characters (the living ones, heheh) are trapped in such an isolated and seemingly hopeless situation. The viewer is pulled into this realm of chaos and darkness, forced to experience the horror along with these unfortunate midnight snacks we call ""the living"". Truly, nothing compares to NOTLD. Romero did it right the first time, and we'll always have it to cherish in our DVD collections. This DVD transfer isn't too bad either. For the price, it has great sound/picture. The catch is that there are no special features. Oh well. Who needs 'em! The movie is the only excuse you need to purchase this DVD. Just be sure to have your baseball bat handy. Hit 'em in the head and they go down quick. But then you've to burn 'em or they just get right back up! Bwahahaha...BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA...bwa.",1122163200,2,2968,4.674952198852773

I was excited to see it, so i bought the DVD and just last night i watched it,and to my surprise i found Night quit dissapointing, it had poor acting, poor editing, poor music, and poor directing in addition of not being scary at all.

So i felt really bad and dissapointed for wasting money on this crap and for wasting my time on such an over-rated movie that has no potential of being anything other than a dead classic that should be left to its own time.",1121904000,,837,4.030120481927711

473434,5,6302484367,"To answer any questions, yes this is THE version to get if you want the original Night of the Living Dead.  Ignore that humiliation that is the 30th anniversary edition.  On to my review.  I saw this movie late one night at around the age of 13, on PBS of all channels (probably because it isn't rated and therefore was unedited).  There was something about it that I can not put into words when I saw it.  It was definitely different then anything I could have imagined from that decade.  Usually things from the 60's are cheesy and poorly done, I.E. a flying saucer being held up with strings.  But several of the makeup effects were done wonderfully for 1968 and Director George Romero took advantage of the black and white, letting the zombies eat what could be chicken bones, yet look like human meat with the lack of color.  This film also had a little social commentary to it, as does every Romero film does.

After finishing this film, I was left with an uneasy feeling, similar to the aftermath of my experience with watching Sam Raimi's the Evil Dead.  Possibly due to the shock that PBS would actually show something like this when most of the time they show just about everything from England.  But also due to the fact that this is not rated we are able to see something that doesn't happen too often with horror movies from this period.  Once the daughter turns into a zombie she quickly stabs her mother to death with a gardening tool.  What I though was going to be pathetic ended up punching me on the face for my foolishness.  Just about everything here is done perfectly.

The only thing that did bug me though, was that although they had a rifle, there were several times where they could have shot a zombie but for some reason, they didn't.  Also, there a few entertaining slipups that are noticeable in the film is you look online and are very entertaining to see as u watch the movie with friends.  My favorite is at the scene when they are taking the boards off the doors so they can get to their truck, you can clearly see ""upper right corner"" written on the board as the man pulls it off and tosses it behind him.  Clearly this is a low budget film.  But, low budget can result in some of the best horror movies because it creates creativity (the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and nowadays it eliminates the annoying CGI.

There are plenty of extras on this DVD, and I'll admit I haven't looked through all of them just yet but there are interviews, trailers, notes from Stephen King, a hilarious parody titled, ""Night of the Living Bread"", commentary by George Romero and the Entire cast, scrapbooks, original props, and plenty more.  You can't go wrong with this sweet thing.  If you are A) a horror movie fanatic, B) haven't seen it but are interested, C) don't own it, or D) All of the Above, then you must click the buy button now, or at least rent it for your own sake because this is the Grandfather of zombie films, there was nothing before this and it will always have it's own little shrine and glow to it because this film deserves it in every aspect.",1119744000,,3092,4.4547069271758435
473435,4,6302484367,"Night of the Living Dead is by appearance a timid zombie film in regards to many others that feast in splattering gore and gruesome zombies devouring the flesh of people.  The heroes in the film are just plain old average people found in every town in every state throughout the United States. The film was shot in black and white to save money while the filmmaker George Romeo had a very strained budget that he had to juggle with.  How could this film create such a wave of dedicated supporters for almost four decades while acquiring cult status?

Simplicity!  George Romero had to maximize on the budget by simplifying the story and maximizing on aspects that were inexpensive.  The story that Romero co-wrote with John A. Russo illustrates that they were aware of the cost of frequent location changes, as they shot the entire film in a very few locations in an area within driving distance from Pittsburgh.  The choice to shoot the film in black and white accentuated the contrasts within the film and together with efficient use of light produced several haunting moments.  The cast consists of a number of unknown actors, which also increases the genuine atmosphere.  A star would have reduced the authenticity of the atmosphere and probably cost much more as well.  Lastly, the moments of humor within the film add a level of humanity to the film that builds a bridge between the story and its audience.

Watching the opening scene at the cemetery is an ingenious move by Romero, as it quickly captures the audience's attention through the symbolical meaning that a cemetery provides in connection with horror films. The trepidation continues to intensify within the scene where a brother spooks his sister with, ""The are coming to get you, Barbara. They are coming for you.""  Ironically, they are coming to get her and everyone else, as the first stumbling corpse ends up in a struggle with Barbara's brother while she tries to escape.

Barbara seeks shelter in an abandoned house where most of the film takes place, as a number of other characters come to seek shelter in the house.  Isolated from civilization with a growing number of uncoordinated corpses trying to find a way inside to gobble on their flesh they begin to fortify the house by barricading the doors and windows.  Some are getting hysterical while others take on leadership roles, as the dead are inching closer to the house under the darkness of the night.  The night is accentuated through the black and white photography, which increases the suspense and anxiety that the film intends to generate.

Conclusively, Night of the Living Dead still haunts its audience after more than 30 years of its initial release.  The film even had a 30th anniversary release in 1998.  The zombies might not look as genuine, as in more recent zombie films, but their strange psychomotor dexterity is what helps generate the lingering fear within the audience, as they appear both bizarre and creepy.  Several directors still employ this movement in their zombie films in order to generate a similar result.  Romero created a cinematic experience comparable to a car accident; it is bad but one cannot help but watch as curiosity takes over.  However, this film is far from bad.  It is an illustration of how dedicated work can pay big dividends to those who pursue their visions, and Night of the Living Dead became the beginning of a number of intriguing zombie films by Romero.",1119657600,3,3444,4.851282051282051

I have only bad memories about the rest of the evening (as do my parents who I kept up the rest of the night).  This movie is creepy in its simple story and low budget.  Those two elements gave the film its realism.  Anyone can become a zombie(cold war fear).  Tortured hero is black(civil rights theme).  I recommend this movie for a vast amount of reasons which are too many to list here.  All my analizing aside it is just one scary as hell movie that still works.,1119484800,,555,4.228571428571429

This is almost a step by step exact remake of the original except for better special effects and a surprise ending, unlike the original ending i thought they should have kept it the same.

My favorite part in this film is where Barbara (Patricia Tallman) turns from the petrified little woman like in the original to the non-scared fighting woman that we all wanted to see her turn into... saying ""They're so slow, if we was careful we could walk right past them.""

The Zombies in this remake are much scarier than in the original and they even move slower. and as for the actors they picked for the lead roles of the main characters I would have to say did an awesome job.

Another favorite part is when Barbara asks if ""this guy looks dead, Is he dead?, BANG, is he dead?, BANG, Does he look dead?"" man that almost cracks me up every time..

Regardless, John Russo and friends totally ruined George Romeros groundbreaking horror classic.  The soundtrack is ridiculous, it sounds as though the composer bought a $30 Casio keyboard and wrote some cheesy gothic horror songs for the soundtrack. And who do they think they are fooling with Bill Heinzman reprising his role as the original zombie 30 years later? Did they think no one would notice he looked like he was close to 40 in the original, and in the new footage he looks like hes 70 at the youngest?Please.  Also i noticed another thing about the family who died at Beekmans Diner in the car crash:Check out one of the kids shoes, as they are actually Sketchers I believe. I'm no expert on the shoe business so correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the Sketchers shoe company was around in 1968.  Did anyone see the ""music video"" for the ridiculous ""Dance of the Dead"".  Thats probably the most entertaining feature about the dvd.  I found the music video to be corny and terrible, but utterly hiliarious.  Anyways, don't waste your money on this garbage.  The new music score is way below subpar as is the acting and scripting for the additional material.  The original Romero feature was a low budget masterpiece.  This, however is just a half-assed attempt at filmmaking and yet another way for no talent filmakers to cash in on a classic.  Avoid.",1108512000,14,1497,4.67175572519084

As for the explanation of the satellite. That is just the guys on the radio, repeating what the scientists are saying. If you will follow the series, you'll quickly realize that people are quick to jump to any explanation, so long as it adds a sence of comfort to there now VERY confused life.

 That's what I love about the series, is not only the awsome concept, the deep thought George put into ""his"" brand of zombies,  the gore, characters (always loveable, even if you hate them), and last but not least, the social commentary!! That is Goerge's strong point, that's what separates this guy from your run of the mill hollywood director. Too bad he rarely gets the respect he deserves. Heck The Dawn remake was AWSOME, but almost completely lost the social commentary. Well that and running zombies...

The movie is good to watch only once or twice in either b&w or color(The colorized version is the best way to watch this) and the this is the movie that introduced us to zombie movies by a unknown director(back then)named George Romero. Don't expect state-of-the-art special effects because the only effects they used were chocolate sauce and meat from the butcher Romero knew but expect a weird and sometimes creepy horror movie that remains a classic still.

Radiation has cause the dead to rise and hunt the living for sustainance. A few people turn a house into a fortress to shield themselves for the carnivorous advances of the walking dead. Veritable ghouls who seek to consume living flesh.

Personalities and wills conflict within the fortress, which eventually leads to the necessary murder {execution} of one of the inhabitants, followed by his family, who all subsequently arise, but are dispatched by the resident leader of this desperate and frightened troop. One tribulation after another, they battle valiantly against the zombies to protect the living, only to be shot square in the forehead by what would have been their rescuers, who mistook him for a ghoul.

Not only do you get awesome quality transfer but you als get a few commentary tracks, interviews, and other goodies included. In my opinion ""Night"" is the best of the dead trilogy.

473564,5,6302484367,"It all started here.  George Romero launched a personal trilogy of classics, a new zombie genre and the idea of good old successful low budget horror movies.  The Night of the Living dead is the first in a trilogy which also includes Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead.  Dawn of the Dead was also recently remade.  Radiation from a crashed satellite has caused the dead to walk.  The movie never really focuses on the cause of the epidemic only because nobody really knows.  The focus on the movie is a group of survivors and their ordeal of trying to cope with the events that have taken place and trying their best survive against the zombies and each other.

For a 1968 flick this has its fair share of gore.  The focus of the movie ultimately though is the character interaction and the clashing of personalities.  Every character handles the situation in their own way and the movie is an interesting look into what extremely stressful situations can do to people.  Compared to modern day filming standards this movie probably would never have even been a blip on the radar.  The acting is fair, the dialogue is good, the special effects are well 60s, the plot is decent, but this movie was the pioneer into this style of horror and thus every zombie flick to follow uses elements of the same formula that the original championed in the first place.  My favorite parts of this movie and arguably the ones with the most tension aren't the scenes which have the characters trying to fight off the zombies, no instead it is as our group survivors sit around with each other talking and trying to learn and understand the true horror of what is transpiring in there turned upside world.  Most of their very little information is gleaned via their radio.  The radio broadcasts are great and are the true catalyst for setting the doomsday setting.  Considering the budget Romero had and the very simple special effects that were available to him at the time, I think that he has done a fantastic job of telling a convincing and truly terrifying apocalypse tale.",1105660800,,2062,4.626373626373627

I have no problem with remaking a good movie. The 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead was fantastic. Remakes or remasters are one thing, but adding brand new scenes to such a beloved film makes no sense. The producers of this final product (George Romero was not involved) should be ashamed of ruining a classic movie.

The new footage, and when I say new, I mean new, shot 30 years after the original, has little to do with the original and really disturbs the flow. New sound effects and score are so heavy handed that they distract you from actually enjoying the movie.

The ""amatuerish"" quality of the cinematography is a coup, making it less of staged movie and more of a realistic experience caught on tape. Who can deny the absolute terror of the opening scenes where the girl is trying to escape from a nightmare most of us have never dared dream?  I agree with another reviewer who commented on the socio-politcal issues of racism, sexism, and other -isms.  Sure, the film works at its primary level--to view others worse off than ourselves and make us greatful for our own sense of security. Good horror films function for us in much the same way tragedy served the ancient Greeks, to purge us of fears and to arouse us to pity--more or less.

Romero is one of the best horror movie directors of all time and he created an instant classic with this movie. The whole concept was great and the acting was great too. The movie follows a couple of people who all find there way to this one house away from any other houses or towns and they realize they are being attacked by the walking dead. Some of them want to barricade themselves in the cellar but the smart people barricaded the doors and the windows and stayed upstairs. Eventually though like most horror movies there was one survivor and he was shot by a group of people with shotguns hunting the dead. The movie was a great horror movie with not too much language and not that much blood and guts and if you like horror then this movie is right for you.,1101600000,4,906,4.273255813953488

I actually expected worse, having seen Dawn of the Dead (the original), which removed a section of my own brain.  I understand Romero did this on a low budget, and even then this movie was well done.  The cinematography was surprisingly good, the acting was very good (especially Duane Jones), and even though these are still the slow, non-threatening comical zombies (or ghouls), the movie was still quite eerie.  It wasn't scary though, as most modern horror movies are just shock horror, and don't actually make you jump out of your seat.  If you want an undead scare, try Evil Dead.  It'll make you jump at LEAST once.  Also, speaking of Dead movies, the remake of Dawn of the Dead was also quite good, and I would personally recommend these two out of the entire series.",1099872000,2,910,4.614906832298137
473572,5,6302484367,"My favorite horror film of all time is NOTLD and when I heard of the new colorized version I was naturally curious. The colorized film looks ok, but not all together too natural looking. I found that the colors worked best on inanimate objects such as trees etc, and in outdoor settings. The flesh tones are acceptable but none the less a good effort. Bottom line is that you can almost pass this off in some places as a color film but only for seconds at a time as frequently something will catch your eye that will shatter the illusion. A bright red shirt for example or an off grouping of strange, clashing colors almost make this too surreal in parts. The fire however colored really nice. I think that it would have benefited also if the contrast was toned down slightly as I think the film looks too colorful at times. Instead of blending, the colors clash too strongly sometimes. The colorized version was taken from a restored version of the film thus the quality and sharpness looks quite good and there are 5.1 and DTS audio tracks available. The special features include a restored black and white version of the movie, not as good as the Millennium Edition DVD transfer which is THX approved but this is very good and the next best edition available at the moment for such a cheap price. The B&W edition only offers the original mono track though but no chapter stops. Also included is a game where you have to guess what celebrity looks like one of the zombies from the film. A pretty useless extra that you will only ever look at once. The commentary track by Mike Nelson is pretty useless too in my opinion. It offers very little info besides the names of the actors, all the while Nelson throws out little comments that are an attempt at humor, mostly putting down the film. There are a few funny comments but most of them aren't. This is comparable to sitting around with a bunch of friends making fun of a movie where everyone just throws in their own comment mocking something. But since this is one of the best horror films ever made, there is little to mock. Overall, I enjoyed at least checking out the results of the color experiment, but the B&W original version is where it's at. The price can't be beat and I would definately recommend that you pick it up for the restored B&W version primarily and treat the colorized version as if it were an extra. I don't think you can be disappointed in this if you don't own any other version of NOTLD. Get this for the original B & W restored version of the film. You will not find such a good transfer at such a good price. The film by itself gets the full 5 stars, so I have no problem giving this release 5. The audio on the B & W could have been better but the original mono is acceptable. If this dvd had only include the colorized version I would have only given this 2 stars, because for one, this movie should not be cheapened by offering a colorized version only, (major points for including both) and the color 'experiment' wasn't entirely successful to stand on its own as something extra special.",1098921600,8,3074,4.442477876106195

People that criticize George Romero/this movie DON'T GET IT.  Period.  I don't know what they perceive as ""scary"", but being out in the middle of nowhere, being chased (as Barbara was in the beginning) certainly is right up there in the chills department!!  Think about it.  I remember as a child my bed facing the door to my bedroom, and I always wanted it left open.  But the problem was, one of my sisters would always hang a coat up there and it looked like someone standing there, just waiting for me to fall asleep.  You don't forget things like that as you grow up and you either grow to love being scared (as I did) or you feed into it and watch ""chick flicks"" the rest of your life!  To each his own I guess.

People have also tied this movie to political connotations and the fact that a black man was the main character.  Funny, but I never picked up on any of that; I just like being scared and this movie served its purpose.  The music was perfect, the camera angles were great, and the tension these people all felt as they lay trapped in a small house out in the middle of nowhere came across to the viewer in such a way that you could actually put yourself in their position.  Movies nowadays like ""28 Days Later"" (what the heck was up with THAT?!), ""Freddie vs. Jason"" (don't even GO there!  'horror' my a--!), and ""Wrong Turn"" are mindless crap that are nothing more than teenage gore-fests!  WHERE is the horror??!

You gotta love the characters in this movie too!  The news commentator is priceless!

Romero begins his ""dead trilogy"" with this piece of crap. Then follows it with another piece of crap. Then follows it with another piece of crap.

It all starts with a trip to the cemetery. This is where Romero shows just how terrible the actors are. Our main female character, Barbara, is a pathetic woman who's brother is too childish. He says, ""They're coming to get you Barbara. They coming for you."" What was Romero thinking when he came up with this?

The whole movie takes place in some tiny house in the middle of an empty field. Inside this house, a dead woman. During the movie, about twenty zombies (who don't go to the mall) wait outside. Why don't they go inside and attack the people? Because the lead male character throws a burning chair outside. This scares the zombies (for some reason) and keeps them away from the house.

Now the acting in this movie is not too bad. Just kidding. It's terrible. Especially the females. I know there were better women actors out back in the sixties. Barbara tries to recreate the ""tragedy"" the occurs at the beginning. When she says, ""He grabbed me."" She actually starts grabbing herself. Then she says, ""He grabbed out my clothes."" She actually starts grabbing her clothes and pulling on them. It's ridiculous.

Romero decides to have a pathetic scene where the characters try to gas-up the truck. This is where Romero shows off his terrible writing by having the zombies fear fire. Zombies don't attack the people because of the fire. Ridiculous.

The worst part about all this is that it fails to be funny. I know Romero was trying to be funny, but he failed miserably. The jokes are terrible. The actors he hired were not meant to be in comedies. Every time they told the audience a joke, it just came out as stupid lines of dialogue.

This crack-head had no idea how to film a movie, and he still doesn't. Let's all wait for his fourth peice of crap that he pulls out of his a$$ and molds into a film, just so we can laugh at it.

Oh, by the way. I recall someone saying that Romero has an original idea going on with his fourth film. Last I checked, he had a vehicle in it called the ""Dead Reckoning"". It was a bunch of armored busses. Sounds like a recent zombie movie. Doesn't it? Then idiots will try to tell you that Romero wrote the script first, so he didn't take anything. That's wrong. The original script for the remake of Dawn was written in 1999. Romero didn't write his script for his fourth dead film until 2001. Seems to me that they have been trying to get the remake of Dawn made longer than the time Romero's been trying to get his fourth film made.

The most disgusting thing of all is that people in the sixties ""flocked like birds to this stink bomb.""---Matt Perri. He's one of those people that say that nobody can compare ""28 Crappy Days Later"" to zombie movies, but anybody can compare zombie movies to ""28 Crappy Days Later"". Yes, that was a qoute from the remake of Dawn, but I wanted to give him credit because he said it first. Yep, he does comapre ""Dawn 2004"" to ""Days"", even though he has said you can't compare them. He does it anyway.

Can you believe. You Romero fans are e-mailing me. You don't see me e-mailing anybody. Even if they call a movie a like the dumbest thing ever made.

OH, and all you people that say the original ""Dawn"" is good because it is about ""consumerism"". Does that mean if I do a 2 hour movie about a leaf growing on a tree, then following to the ground, it should become a ""classic"". Right? That what you guys are saying with the original ""Dawn"". It was about ""consumerism"", it was stupid. I got into an argument at school with my Spanish teacher who used to work at a video rental. We were talking about the original ""Dawn "" and the remake (this was during class. Everyone in the room was listening). All he would ever go back to was the fact that it was about ""consumerism"". That's it. Whenever I got him, he would say the original was about ""consumerism"", and the remake was not. This means, to me, that if one were to do a movie and make a metaphor out of it, then one would get lots of money. That's what Romero fans did with Romero's films. He made a metaphor, and you liked. That doesn't take away the fact that his movies are boring, cheesy, stupid, pathetic, idiotic pieces of crap he pulled out of his as* and molded into a film. I make a movie about a leaf falling to the ground. First we watch it grow for two hours, then it falls. No acting, no script, No CGI, no visuals, nothing, but i'm making a metaphor. I'm saying that we are all leaves growing on a tree until our time is up, then we fall on the ground. It should be a classic. Right? That's what Romero fans did with the crappy ""dead trilogy"". Hey, they call it a ""dead trilogy"" for a reason. It's dead. Let it go. Romero sucks.

E-mailing people you don't know. Is that what Romero fans like to do to pass the time?",1094256000,6,4984,4.34731182795699
473650,5,6302484367,"George Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is darn near flawless. It had been a while since I'd seen it so I decided to watch it again last night. I had forgotten how great a movie this really is. Many of the horror movies of the 60's (and prior) start and develope slowly. While there's nothing wrong with that approach, this movie is an exception. Within 5 minutes the action starts and doesn't let up even while developing the tension between the primary characters. While obviously influential to all zombie movies that came after it, most have lost the traits that make this movie so well made. The slow-eerie-claustrophobic-tension filled-panic stricken-all hope is lost atmosphere of this movie is one of a kind. There's no other zombie movie quite like it.",1093996800,2,764,4.8396946564885495

473656,1,6302484367,"Another terrible movie from that terrible Director George A. Romero. This time, there are only about twenty zombies waiting outside.
The zombies in this look better than those in Dawn of the Dead (1978)but are still very boring and unrealistic. Like i've said before, zombies wouldn't be able to move without certain orgains opertating properly in their bodies. Another thing I have just discovered is the fact that if the heart and lungs were operating and moving the body, then the rest of the organs in the body would be recieving blood, so they would be operating too. Meaning the body would be alive. ALIVE!!!!
The story is terrible. A group of people seek shelter in some house and, for some reason, are afraid to leave. There are about 15-20 zombies waiting outside. Why don't they just brake in the house? Because the man sets a chair on fire and throws it outside. Wait a minute. Why are they afraid of fire? They're dead. They don't know what fire is and they don't get hurt by the flames. Why does it scare them so? Romero never answered that question. It sounds to me like Romero just needed an answer.
Another question not answered. Why are zombies walking around the earth? They put out the idea of radiation from Venus, but never confirmed it. In Dawn of the Dead (1978) they said that there was a possibility of a viral outbreak. So , they still haven't found the answer. I wonder when Romero will tell the answer. If Romero doesn't need to answer the question, why does James Gunn's and Zack Snyder's obviousley superior version of Dawn need an explanation. They set out the idea of a virus, just like the original Dawn. Who knows? It sounds to me like the people are just trying find away to make an argument between which version of Dawn was better. The answer to that is obvious. The new Dawn.
The acting is terrible. I know it was low-budget, but you could get better women performances from the lady serving you at the resteraunt. The women in the movie were just terrible. The men were good, but the women were terrible. I couldn't stand them.
This is a comedy that was poorly done. It wasn't very funny and...What? It's not a comedy? It looked like a comedy. It wasn't scary, or entertaining as a matter of fact. I thought they were trying to be funny. The way the zombies acted, the acting, the lines, the pathetic attempt to gas up the truck. I thought this was supposed to be a comedy.
This is a terrible movie and a terrible DVD. I think it's about time George Romero died. He's just not a good director.
Thank god they fired him from Resident Evil. I can't stand thinking of the name. George A. Romero's Resident Evil. It's the George A. Romero's part that I don't like. Paul Anderson did a better job than Romero would have ever done.",1089590400,3,2764,4.50796812749004

Back when Romero and Russo wrote and films this, they did not yet realize they were created a whole new subgenre of horror. Much as I like the remake, the undead are creepiest in the shadows of black and white film.
I'm writing to respond to one reviewer's nitpick and another reviewer's well-intentioned mistake. Complaining that most of it is in mono is like complaining that it's in black and white. That's how the original was made, plain and simple. Another reviewer complained about how horrible the version with added footage is. That individual is right about that version, but that's the 30th Anniversary Edition and NOT the Millenium Edition. The 30th Anniversary Edition with added scenes and weird, distracting music is too horrible for words, and not even in a ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" so-bad-it's-funny way. The Millenium Edition is simply an official DVD made from a cleaned up print, with extras like the interviews.

The brother started teasing his sister, telling her in a creepy voice, ""They're coming to get you, Barbara."" However, the joke ended up being on him because they were coming to get Barbara, only they got him first.
I first saw ""Night of the Living Dead"" when I came home one afternoon and discovered that the Iowa City Public Library Channel on cable was showing the film. I have to admit, I was rather surprised that this cult classic horror film would be on at a time when kids could come home and discover it on television since one of the living dead is naked and the whole point is that they have risen from the dead to eat human flesh.  All of this only goes to prove that ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a horror movie that is even scary in the daytime with all the lights on and the sun shining brightly through the window.
""The Night of the Living Dead"" is a true classic horror film, which is rather surprising when you take into account that director George A. Romero made the film in 1968 for $114,000 without a cast of first time actors (extras who playing the zombies were paid $1 and a t-shirt that said ""I was a zombie on Night of the Living Dead""). Filmed in black and white with Romero as the cinematographer, this film has a technical proficiency that is missing from other low-budget classics such as ""Dementia 13"" and ""Carnival of Souls."" You can take or leave the various sequels to this film, some of which definitely ahve their moments, but this one has to be on everyone's Top 10 list when it comes to horror films.
The horror comes from the situation and the simple effectiveness of the slow moving, silent zombies in their growing numbers, their arms reaching out to find human flesh to eat. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) runs to an abandoned house, where she is joined by Ben (Duane Jones). After fending off the first attack of the living dead, they discover five more people hiding in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife, Helen (Marilyn Eastman), and their daughter (Kyra Schon), along with a young couple, Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry wants to hide out in the basement, but refuses to be trapped down there, and the two spend more time arguing about what to do than doing anything. They listen to the radio and watch the TV, learning that the dead are rising to eat the living, and try to figure out a way of getting out of the death trap in which they find themselves. Meanwhile, the little girl in the basement is slipping away.
The only real weakness in the film is the attempt to explain why the dead are walking around as flesh-eating ghouls (a redundantphrase to be sure), which has something to do with a satellite and scientific mumbo-jumbo that really does not mean anything to the people trying to survive against the growing horde of zombies. Fortunately, the ""why"" does not matter in this story; just the ""how"" in terms of taking these creatures down. Besides, if anything clinches this one it is the end of the film, both with its final twist, and the use of grainy still photographs to show the end of the tale. Few horror movies, whatever their budgets, have an ending this memorable.",1085184000,3,3282,4.506711409395973

And John Russo, the talentless co-writer of the original NIGHT and the director of the new scenes for this new NIGHT,  says, ""This is what we wanted to do originally.""
If that's so, I imagine the conversation between Russo and George Romero in 1968 during the production went like this:
John Russo: Hey George, wouldn't it be cool if we added a subplot with a bald-headed geek as a priest and two gravediggers at the beginning?
George Romero: No, John. That's stupid.

473704,5,6302484367,"Johnny and Barbra head through the country in route to the cemetery their departed father currently resides at. Though he may not remain dead much longer. George A. Romero's seminal cult classic starts off in a somber tone with an ominous title sequence culminating with his own credit superimposed opposite an American flag. Ostensibly we're witness to a mundane annual trip to the gravesite of a half remembered pops. Johnny and Barbra are siblings, and the former preys on the latter's fear of her surroundings. ""They're coming to get you, Barbra!"" he insists. It's all in jest of course. Johnny means her no harm. As they depart, Johnny notices an intoxicated looking man lumbering about and exclaims, ""Look! There's one now!"". As the odd man comes closer he indeed does attack Barbra, and thus begins one of the genres most appealing outings.
  Johnny is quick to assist in repelling Barb's attacker, engaging in a fists to cuffs with the gaunt creature. Johnny falls, cracks his head against stone granite, and lies prostate. Barbra's on her own. She decides to make a run for the car, and upon securing herself inside, realizes she hasn't the keys. Oh dear. The odd man isn't so lumbering that it takes him very long to reach Barbra in her steel prison, and soon he's bludgeoning the car's window with a brick. Our protagonist isn't catatonic quite yet however (though she occupies most her later screen time in this state), and she has sense enough to release the emergency  break. As she coasts down the dirt road, the odd man staggers after her in a fevered pursuit. The car makes an impromptu stop at the base of a tree, and Barb makes another dash out in this evermore peculiar world. This time she makes it to a more fortified locale, a farmhouse.
  Once inside she makes an exploration of the premises. She discovers the phone is out and the owner(s) have a thing for taxidermy. Our heroine seems to be on the brink of a complete mental breakdown when Ben comes crashing in. Now about Ben, well, Ben's the man. He takes charge of the situation going immediately to work on further fortifying the farmhouse. He also relates to Barbra a rather strange occurrence concerning a group of  men, not dissimilar to Barbra's pursuer, who were terrorizing  people outside a diner. Barb's pretty out of it though, and begins to rave on about Johnny, and demands they go back to his rescue. Such a vehement frenzy she exudes that it behooves our hero Ben to smack her one for her own good.
  Later, they discover more people. There are the Coopers; Harry, Helen, and there young daughter who's received a nasty bite from one of the ghouls. Also a young couple; Tom and Judy. They've holed up down in the basement. When Ben asks Harry why he hadn't come up when he heard the screaming, he insists he was unsure if it was of any use. ""For all we knew you could have been one of those things!"", he exclaims. Tensions run high as Ben claims command of the upstairs and Harry the basement. Both men have good ideas, but refuse to work together. Ultimately, this lack of  cohesiveness will lead to their doom.
  Night of the Living Dead, much like it's two sequels, isn't so much about the zombies as it is about the relationships between people forced to band together. The farmhouse bunch form a sort of micro colony, and the actions of one effect the well being of them  all. It's also very much a product of it's time. Coming out in the same year that saw both the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert Kennedy, and with the war raging on, the movie is certainly indicative of it`s time. It also owes a great deal to Richard Matheson's novel ""I Am Legend"", which also deals with society upheaval.
  Beyond that, and why it's truly so endearing, is it's great storytelling. The story unfolds slowly at first and then starts to rip along at a relentless pace. There are many scenes that induce audience participation. Rummaging the farmhouse for supplies, and waiting eagerly for the next T.V. or radio announcement. Then, contemplating the next move of action. The movie really has you becoming involved with the group. The horror elements are all there to, including one very grizzly scene involving a trowel. The films infamous final moments are indelible and certainly do much to solidify it's place in cinema history. Night of the Living Dead is really the beginning of a decade of genre classics. It's gorilla filmmaking style laid the tracks for such classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and it reminds us of a time when horror films were about a little more than just making you jump from your seat.",1083542400,,4624,4.677339901477833

The Anchor Bay versions out there are garbage, they added all these un-edited and terrible scenes. They just ruin the classic, don't waste your money on the 30th anniversary edition or limited edition. Pure TRASH! The bonus material on the millenium edition is also better, an interesting interview with Duane Jones, two insightful commentaries, some of George A.

Still, if you understand what Romero's trying to do here, you'll understand the importance of his directorial full feature length movie that doesn't cost a lot in production but really brings what many have copied to this day.
The movie alone is a good watch. With unknown actors then, the fun part is 6 total strangers trying to survive an ordeal throughout the night with zombies banging at their doorstep, but the fight is actually within them on how to get out alive without fighting among each other. The ending is the biggest twist that will leave you either shock or despair.
The special features so far for this edition is a fun watch. Documentaries, scrapbook gallery stills and clips or Romero's commercial ads, plus a whole bunch of stuff that is worthy to be called a Millennium Edition.
My only regrets is I heard there is a 15 minute deleted scenes in other editions and this one doesn't have it.

473730,5,6302484367,"""Night of the Living Dead"" is the greatest horror film of all time, and probably the most important one of the last 50 years.  Much of the time, groundbreaking films are not particularly remarkable artistically-- they simply get by on doing something that had never been done before.  NotLD is a particularly glaring exception because it is so effortlessly and organically transgressive.  A film like ""Last House on the Left"" seems to exist exclusively for the purpose of pushing the audience to the edge, but NotLD never announces that it is a new, darker sort of horror film.  One gets the impression that Romero and Russo and all the others didn't even specifically intend to make a more graphic horror film when they started out.  It appears almost normal, initially, but moves inexorably towards the horrific conclusion, at all points defying the expectations as to who ought to survive, or whether or not bravery or cowardice ought to be rewarded.  It never feels self-conscious or scripted, and that's why it holds up so well even after it is no longer a particularly morbid or gruesome film.  Despite the supernatural elements, NotLD is disturbingly authentic.

Horror films tend not to be to big on plot, and ""Night of the Living Dead"" is no exception.  It is your standard zombie apocalypse plot, though, of course, no such thing existed at the time.  Most modern zombie films take the action-horror route along with an urban setting, but NotLD is pure horror, and takes place inside a desolate farmhouse out in the Pennsylvania countryside. As the film opens we are introduced to Barbara and Johnny, brother and sister.  These are characters we've seen before: Barbara is snippety and uptight, and seems to be well on her way to becoming an old spinster.  Johnny feels like the hero, and he'd probably feel at home in a 50's Sci-Fi or Horror flick, as he's whiny and jokey and teases his sister.  Still, he seems to have a good, courageous heart, however, as he immediately comes to his sisters aid after she's assailed by a strange man in the graveyard. But Oops! Johnny gets his brains bashed in only a few minutes into the film.  And though she's technically alive Barbara is more or less out for the count for the rest of the film, and mostly lounges about in a nearly catatonic stupor.

Barbara flees to an apparently abandoned farm house, and we are shortly introduced to the films real hero, Ben, played by Duane Jones.  The acting in the film isn't exactly  terrific, but Jones is good as Ben, and helps create one of the most appealing protagonists in all film.  He's smart and capable but certainly not a saint-- Notice how he decks the hysterical Barbara after she slaps him  during her vain attempt to get them to search for the now very dead Johnny.  Much has been made out of the fact that he's black.  Romero will tell you that this means nothing, or nothing more than that Jones was the best actor they could find for the part, regardless of race.  Again, the roots of NotLD's greatness are exposed-- They were neither conforming to nor defying tradition.  They simply made it their way.

The core of the film is not especially eventful: Ben works to barricade the house, and eventually argues with the unexpected tenants in the basement, two couples and one child.  These scenes show that Romero really knew what he was doing from the very beginning, and that his experience in industrial films and commercials wasn't wasted.  The film somehow maintains a slightly hypnotic intensity in the section as Ben seals of the house while the all to calm radio announcer drones on and on in a hopeless attempt to get a grip on the whole extraordinary situation.  Romero keeps the camera moving and the editing sharp so that even after over 10 viewing my mind never wanders in this seemingly uneventful section of the film. (This is a good description of the visual style of the film in general, as it is far from flashy and very realistic, but still energetic enough that it never really feels flat.)  And then there is, of course, Ben's dramatic monologue about his first encounter with the ""things"".  This scene has been surpassed a few times in later films, like ""Jaws"" or ""28 Days Later"", but it still holds up very well.

Eventually, the majority of the farmhouse's residents determine that it's best not to simply wait around for help, and plan a fairly reasonable escape.  Suffice to say, things do not go well.  I don't want to go into too many specific as it'll hurt the film, but this part is really quite brilliant.  Their plan seems really quite reasonable on the face of it, but it proves disastrous.  Fate and human error intervene, and we a treated to one of the earliest gore scenes you'll ever see outside of an H.G. Lewis film, as the ghouls feed on charred remains while ominous, amelodic electronic music drones on in the background.  Again, this isn't remarkably gruesome by modern day standards, but it's probably the creepiest zombie-feast scene ever filmed.

Shortly after this things spiral out of control between the survivors, and all hell break's loose, leading up to one of the greatest endings in all film.  Again, I won't go into specifics, but it's just such a classic, senselessly tragic endings.  It's been knocked off many times, but the ending here still has the sorta authenticity that you find in all the rest of the film.  This isn't a morose, violent ending that a supposedly edgy director stuffed on to prove how far he'd push boundaries This is just they way it happened to turn out.  Just a great film.

The Elite Millenium Edition is the only way to go.  Good transfer and sound, nice extras.

Well, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Supposedly this version is to be avoided, but I did not know that going into this. I must admit, I did see a second or two of brilliance here and there throughout the film, but all in all it was utterly EXCRUCIATING.
Poorly edited, terribly acted (both of which mean to me that Romero is an awful director), synched like a Japanese overdub at parts, and not in the least bit humorous as I was led to believe.  I don't see a classic in here in any sense.  The lighting/setting and music were the only descent things about this flick.  I hung in there, waiting for the promised greatness to come, but all I got for my trouble was an Alistair Crowley wannabe spending the last 5 minutes of the film irritating me more than a parental lecture did at age 15.

""They're coming to get you, Barbara!"" NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD changed everything with its social commentary on the Vietnam War, racism, and dysfunctional families among other things that were rampant in 1968. Also, those gore scenes with the dead chowin' down can still induce cringes and stomach cramps with the best of 'em, even in black-and-white! I saw this on A&E in edited form in 1999 and bought the Millenium Edition in 2002. While I can't say much about NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD that hasn't been said already, I will say that everybody NEEDS to see this movie if they haven't already! A CLASSIC!
Last year, I met several people from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD at the HorrorFind Convention in Maryland. A weekend to remember! I met John A. Russo, Russell Streiner (Johnny), Karl Hardman (Harry Cooper), Marilyn Eastman (Helen Cooper), Kyra Schon (Karen Cooper), Bill Hinzman (the first zombie), and Judith O'Dea (Barbara). They were all wonderful people in real life and they graciously signed my Millennium Edition DVD cover! This year, I'm going to meet the director himself, George A. Romero, at this year's HorrorFind convention! George A.

The notion of having everything you know throw into chaos and living in a nightmare world with danger lurking around everycorner is a very intriguing scenario. Its the sort of fuel that keeps my zombie-fiending ablaze for as long as I'm alive. This movie paints such a painting with a furious ambition to drive itself into the very thoughts and the very souls of its viewer's. The striking black and white does much more than illustrate the director's vision; it complements it quite well, the director doing his part to drive the characters and story, and the camera putting these people and places in a place from which they never shall escape: in a classic vision of toil and fear. It works in surprisingly subtle ways, and its hard to draw your attention from the story and characters, but the camerawork really shines when what we see is the same thing the character's see; their impending doom. The zombies stand out as the unstoppable force which throws all familiarity offcource and sends our ideas of safety to the wind.

473778,5,6302484367,"1968 would happen to be a year when social stigmas were at a high and everyone was looking for an escape, either through mind-altering drugs or at the local cineplex.  George A. Romero and a band of friends in and around Pennsylvania happened to have the perfect escape.  From the opening credits to the final onslaught by the living dead on a small farmhouse inhabited by a colorful array of characters, ""Night of the Living Dead"" takes the viewer on a trip through fear and hidden social agendas.
In 1968, films were afraid to depict the horrors that graced the screne in Romero's film.  And with the added effect of shooting on black and white film stock, it was a ground-breaking venture which opened the floodgates for future shockers in a similar vein.
Many watch ""Night of the Living Dead"" as a film about a group of people trapped in a house, being terrorized by the walking dead.  But Romero had to add his own touch.  By analyzing the film, one can see the numerous social situations Romero put his characters in, dealing with racial tension, designation of individual class structure and the fear of war.  To some, ""Night"" is a simple film, while to others, like myself, it is a work of art, depicting the fears of the world as seen by Romero himself.
In 1993, I had the opportunity to attend the 25th Anniversary of ""Night of the Living Dead"" at the Pittsburgh Expomart.  The whole cast was present, except for the late great Duane Jones.  For three days, I chatted with..., watched previews with..., and even took a cruise on the river with the cast and crew of ""Night"".  I don't know who was more surprised by the turnout at the convention; myself or those who worked on the film.  While talking to Marilyn Eastman, she stated that she was surprised to see the number of people who their small, independent film had touched.  Karl Hardman added that it was nice to be able to give something to the film world in the form of ""Night of the Living Dead"".
Through all of the work that Romero has done, one can look on ""Night of the Living Dead"" as a masterpiece in the realm of cinema.  It goes beyond the realm of horror and touches in the realm of art.  How many more films can one look at and see the influence it has had on others.

473801,5,6302484367,"The first time I saw ""Night of the Living Dead"" was at my own house, in the middle of the day, on a VHS tape I rented from a video store. The second time was on one of the worst excuses for a DVD I had ever seen: A Hollywood Classics edition of NOTLD that my buddy Jon had picked up for six bucks at Best Buy. It was worth every penny. The quality of it was so awful. The sound was off key, the picture looked like it was a digital transfer from an old tape someone had left in their garage to go through a few freezes, and the general look of it was terrible. So I say all hail the geniuses at Elite Entertainment who took it upon themselves to reissue this classic of horror films with a look and sound quality better than it originally had. The THX transfer of the film is impeccable. It looks simply amazing. But anyway, the reason I'm writing this review is because I've written three reviews for ""Dawn of the Dead,"" two for ""Day of the Dead,"" and yet I've never even touched on George Romero's original film that started it all.
Back in 1968, George Romero and his buddies were directing local commercials, using the money they made during the day to film ""Night of the Living Dead"" after hours. The story of a group of recluses trapped in an abandoned farm house out in the middle of Nowheresville, Pennsylvania with the living dead pounding on their doors, turning them against one another in a way that reflected the paranoia of the times. That's how I would've described the film to a potential investor. Oh yeah, did I mention that they were going to break all ground previously laid in the field of gore in cinema? The sight of former humans ripping flesh from char-fried limbs and a little girl laying waste to her mother with a gardening trowel are among the blood-caked spectacles in this film.
Shot in a grisly black and white that further accents the hopelessness in that house, ""Night"" is more about evoking the emotions of the humans as they fear the unknown and each other, more than the terror inflicted by the zombies outside. Throughout the entire trilogy of the Living Dead, George Romero has used his zombies to symbolize what human beings are becoming, as opposed to using them to instill fear in us. The real horror lies in that human beings, so involved with themselves, are becoming zombies, and that, if we can't work together toward a common goal like the people trapped in this ramshackle little farmhouse, then we deserve to be ripped to shreds and eaten alive by our fellow man. It's our fate if we can't be civilized.
If the zombies do really represent us, just on a lower evolutionary chain of civility, acting merely on instinct, then there's another point to be made, too. As great apes evolving into who we are now, humans worked together much easier than they seem to now. The instincts of these zombies is grotesque and stomach churning, but they are blameless; victim to their own way of half-life and hopeless to learn more in their search for food. Yet, they work together; they don't prey on each other. Not like the civilized humans trapped in the house who can't stop fighting with each other, thinking only of saving their own behinds. And as the last shot is fired, the last survivor drops to the floor. We don't deserve to survive. We let our paranoia and selfishness defeat us in the end.

473802,5,6302484367,"What makes this movie work so well is that it relies on real scarry creatures, eerie direction and great use of black and white film while later versions relied on gory special effect body mutilations.
The movie starts right out with a funeral in a grave yard. A man and his sister are visiting their mother's grave and the woman is quite unnerved about being in the graveyard. The man starts to play on her uneasiness saying things like ""Barbara, they're coming to get you Barbara."" Suddenly up walks a kind of frightening man and her brother than says ""here comes one of them now."" We the audience still think nothing of it and the brother is still laughing and taunting his sister, when the strange man gets real close and then just starts attacking the brother. We experience real horror as we realize that it is not really a scarry looking man but a kind of zombie. After quickly dispatching her brother, the zombie starts to chase the already shaken Barbara.
What follows is a very tense, well directed chase. Barbara somehow gets away from the man/zombie and makes it to a house. In the house she meets a few people that have taken refuge from the apparent army of zombies that are now walking around the area trying to kill anyone they see.
We then meet the real star of the movie, a black man who serves as the ""sane"" leader of the refugees giving them direction on how to fortify the house against the attacking zombies.
What follows are many tense moments inside the house as the people argue about what they need to do to surivive.

I remembered parts of the movie from when I'd watched it on VHS, and thought that Barbara would live, but no one in the film lives, which is kinda depressing, but differs in that it doesn't have a happily-ever-after ending.

Being the over-analytical person that I am, I wondered how were the zombies able to break the door.  I mean, c'mon, its a solid wood door on an old farmhouse, but like I said, I'm over-analytical.

Night of the Living Dead is quality, provided you watch the proper version. By all means skip/burn the 30th Edition like the plague! Lots of comments on that already, so...
Suspense of disbelief is hardly necessary because it's all so realistic. No tongue-in-cheek fun, this is. No--gripping, hard-edged classic cinema is what you get. I didn't even miss the colors (joking here; I watch as many black and white films as those with the pretty colors).
And then the ending... I saw it all just before it happened on the screen (the right time). Just this ending confirms my belief that the people who made Night of ... are brilliant and know what they are doing.

473808,5,6302484367,"George A. Romero directed this masterpiece back in the late 60s and it defined a new type of filmmaking, a whole new genre and a new type of horror film. In many ways this film is a landmark piece of work that pushed the whole boundaries of filmmaking outwards and gave the system a run for its money. The violence is graphic and gory. Good guys die. A black man is in a lead role. A child murders her mother. A totally untypical Hollywood ending. It had all the hallmarks of a film that should have tanked in the box office, but it did not and the overall reaction was extremely positive. People had never seen anything like it before and quickly a whole barrage of copycat horror films started to appear on the scene.
Basically the story has been rehashed by a million horror films that followed in its wake. Virus takes over the planet, the dead rise, survivors barricade themselves into a house and fight off the monsters and fight between themselves. By todays standards everything in this movie is cheesy from the hamming acting to bad special effects and the stupid ""Dont go there"" type maneuvers that some of the cast make and it is very slow in parts. Aside from all its misgivings it also has lots of surprises in store and the ending still manages to shock.
The ""Citizen Kane"" of horror movies is right here and any fan of the horror genre should not be without a copy.  A critical part of anyones collection.
[By the way - you may have noticed that a number of competitive dealers are trying to sell their own brand of this movie. Just get the one that has been not been re-edited and make sure that it is really grainy and the transfer looks crap. If you have a color edition, just tune your television to black and white. The worse it looks the better. Just forget the ""extra-stuff"" hogwash. What you want is the gritty original feel.]",1066867200,4,1849,4.438235294117647
473809,5,6302484367,"If you want to learn the art of making a horror movie, just watch George Romero's macabre masterpiece Night of the Living Dead.  So many times, when it comes to horror, simpler is better, and this is actually a pretty simple film.  It manages to create an atmosphere of rising fear while, at the same time, serving as a veritable study in the psychology of terror.  It also has the perfect amount of humor that makes horror all the more enjoyable to me, and the truly classic ending of the film ranks among my favorite endings of all time.  This ain't Abbot & Costello Meet The Mummy; this is gritty, atmospheric, gutsy horror at its best.  It no longer offers the actual fright that was its bread and butter when it was released in 1968, but it's still nightmarish enough to make many a person squirm in anticipatory dread if nothing else.
Who can forget the opening scene of this masterpiece?  A brother and sister drive 200 miles to lay a wreath on their father's grave, with their banter culminating in dear old Johnny's teasing his sister by moaning the words, ""They're coming to get you, Barbra.""  Much to his surprise, ""they"" are coming to get her, and him, and untold numbers of innocent people all throughout the eastern half of the United States.  Barbra (Judith O'Dea) flees to a farmhouse, where she commences to wig out in a quiet, childlike sort of way.  She is soon joined by a young black man named Ben (Duane Jones), who becomes the driving force of the movie.  He begins boarding up the house, getting little help from his near-comatose compatriot, but it turns out that there are also five people already holed up in the cellar.  The meeting of all these minds leads to a bickering marathon, with Ben claiming authority and the measly-mouthed Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) resisting every step of the way.  Trapped inside the house, the band of survivors does have access to radio and television, whereby they learn the extent of the unbelievable epidemic of mass murder and, later, get the news that the killers are recently deceased bodies (who have come to life in a hokey way I'll refrain from mentioning) who share a common passion for cannibalism.  The group's struggle to survive is one of increasing intensity, making for a completely absorbing movie.  Those of a psychological turn of mind can enjoy studying the widely varying reactions of each individual to what is essentially unimaginable terror.  And the ending, as I've said, is just a wondrous thing to behold.
You just don't necessarily need a huge budget to make a genuinely scary, classic film.  Just get a bunch of people, throw some pale makeup on them and tell them to walk funny and slow, then hole up a gang of strangers in a house surrounded by your zombies, and you've got the basic ingredients for your very own Night of the Living Dead.  Of course, only a director as talented as George Romero can turn such a film into a masterpiece, which is accomplished in no small degree by his brilliant use of black and white rather than color film.  Night of the Living Dead may well be the most famous zombie film of all time; it is without question one of the best.  If you don't have a copy of this film in your video/DVD library, even this inexpensive, bare-bones version, then your true horror movie addict credentials are a little suspect.

The stuff they added in as plain of terms as I can think of SUCKS and in fact they actually cut other stuff in order to add the new stuff...Is anyone else having a hard time with this?

473844,1,6302484367,"I am commenting on the 30th Ed only not the film as it was made orginally ;(which gets 5 stars for being a perfect example of a horror movie).
This version of easily a classic film is dreadful. I don't just mean 'Anne Nicole Smith' dreadful but more 'Pauly Shore' dreadful.
What u get here is an extra 15 min of footage added to an already perfect film and 15 min of orginal footage taken out. Quite simply, the new footage is by far the worst slice of acting, ego and obession with a product that needed none of it.
First of all John Russo is a hack that had to have his work polished by George A Romero back in 1968 to even make it a worthwhile film. Johns claim to fame on this movie is that he came up with the idea that the zombies would eat flesh. Based on that he has arranged with fellow delusional buddy's to add more dimension to the story.
He aint done this.
What he has done is make new footage based around the graveyard zombie from the orginal and added the worst acting priest in the world. These scenes make a mockary of the entire film and i pledge people new to this film to watch the original as it should be seen.
I have no issues with getting another addition of the movie so that the picture and sound are better, (personally the old grain effect added to the movie, but seeing it crystal clear was great).
But do not by this addition.
It really doesn't add to the film but clearly subtracts from the overall movie. I did enjoy the more extensive scenes with the zombies from the diner and the car wreak but that was it.
Oh actually the music was ok but those new scenes are just that bad. It gets one star because the original is a classic and well worth multiple views, this is worth dumping in the nearest bin.

473845,3,6302484367,"The Night of The Living Dead is one of the scariest films ever made, and one of my all time favorites, a classic film that has earned through the years a cult and loyal following worldwide, an excellent feature debut of underrated director George Romero.
So a 30th anniversary edition was eagerly anticipated, trusting the filmmakers and studio to offer fans a real treat that is worthy of the status the film enjoys. However,I was disappointed for several reasons,
There are many classic films that have additional unseen footage added to their DVD release or re-release, scenes that were too long to inculde in the theatrical release (Dances with Wolves, Amadeus),or scenes that the director and/or studio decided to cut for artisitc reasons (Exorcist), only to be added later and marketed cleverly. However, it is a rarity that filmakers would go to the trouble of filming additonal footage and drop it in the original. This can be a hit and miss venture, a very precarious decision that can enhance the film or diminish it.
In the case of Night of the Living Dead, the new scenes were added, primarily as the film makers claim to give more backgroud to the story, more than they could have done back in '68. But personally I think it was a mistake (for me what makes Night of Living Dead a classic is the when and where and not the why of zombies). The first mistake is to include new scenes at the beginning and end of the film, a very sensitive area to tamper with, for the original film's power lies in the opening scene of the car driving through the cemetry, setting from the first second a mood that is carried through till the last frame. To add a new scene of the burial of the original zombie, kind of deflates this mood.
The ending of the original film is extremely powerful, unexpected and ironic and leaves the viewer with a sense of tension that lingers long after, and to add scenes of the reporter and a demented priest to the ending gives the film an unnecessary reasoning. While the few additional scenes dropped in the middle of the films of zombies roaming the woods do not add anything to the film.
Finaly I was disappointed with the making of featurette. For the 30th anniversary I would have imagined that there will be many on camera commets and anecdotes (this is reserved for the audio commentary), and what we get instead is just a nine minutes long making of the new additional scenes featurette.
So if you are a fan of the film, by all means add it to your collection, for it is a disturbing horror film the kind of rarely made these days, one that should remain untouched.",1061078400,,2605,4.568376068376068

Everyone else seemed so hysterical to the point where the film was more campy than scary. For that reason, I didn't care about what happened to the characters except for Duane Jones'. He kept the film at a higher degree of realism, but he was surrounded by rather mediocre actors playing sometimes stupid and irrational characters.

Those of us that were unfortunate enough to score the 30th Anniversary 1998 edition are probably still cringing at the new soundtrack and awfully acted brand new scenes, filmed exclusively for the 30th anniversary edition.  Millenium edition, however, makes up for the past mistakes.
With absolute crystal clarity on the picture, Millenium Edition delivers probably the cleanest and sharpest picture I've ever seen for this film.  Scenes that were in pitch blackness in the movie are now alive and bright with great detail.  The sound has also been considerably improved, with crystal clarity and very minimal distortion.  I've never seen a black and white movie look or sound so good.
As for the film itself, this is the original classic that we all know and love.  Probably one of the scariest movies of all time, Night of the Living Dead hit in 1968 with alot of shock.  When it went on to become a cult classic, it ended up becoming one of the most popular horror films ever, spawning spin offs and lesser known and appreciated sequels that never lived up to the original.  Millenium edition gives us that very same film, with none of the extra garbage thrown into the 30th anniversary edition.
As for extras, this DVD is very well treated.  There are video interviews with some stars, as well as an interview recorded with star Duane Jones, which would unfortunately be his final interview not long before he unfortunately passed away in the late 1980's.  In this interview Duane Jones talks about his favorite moments from the film, as well as some personal experiences he had as a professor at Old Westbury college here on Long Island in regards to the film.  Other features include the hilarious parody 'Night of the Living Bread' and a clip from one of Romero's early movies.
Overall, this is the absolute best version of Night of the Living Dead that you can own.  If you own any other version, don't hesitate to pick this one up as well...it is well worth the money and stands out as the best edition of this movie currently in circulation.

Now onto the film.  George Romero forever revolutionized the horror genre with this chilling story of a group of people barracading themselves inside a house to withstand a horde of re-animated corpses who have a taste for human flesh.  However, what set Night of the Living Dead apart from other horror films (and many other following horror films to feature zombies) is that Romero uses the people trapped in the house as a case study on human nature, and the results prove more chilling than the flesh eating ghouls trying to break in.  Also when watching the film, as one previous reviewer has already stated, the word ""zombie"" is never mentioned once.  Over the years many films featuring zombies would follow, such as City of the Living Dead, the gore classic Dead Alive, and Dan O'Bannon's homage to this film Return of the Living Dead; and while they were all great in they're own right, the original Night of the Living Dead remains a horror staple and one of the most chilling films of all time.

Its the sort of fuel that keeps my zombie-fiending ablaze for as long as I'm alive. This movie paints such a painting with a furious ambition to drive itself into the very thoughts and the very souls of its viewer's. The striking black and white does much more than illustrate the director's vision; it complements it quite well, the director doing his part to drive the characters and story, and the camera putting these people and places in a place from which they never shall escape: in a classic vision of toil and fear. It works in surprisingly subtle ways, and its hard to draw your attention from the story and characters, but the camerawork really shines when what we see is the same thing the character's see; their impending doom. The zombies stand out as the unstoppable force which throws all familiarity offcource and sends our ideas of safety to the wind.

Some people fleeing the zombies barricade themselves inside a farmhouse.  In addition to keeping the zombies out of the farmhouse sanctuary, the people inside the farmhouse must master their own paralyzing fears and must survive their own infighting for leadership.

What's really a shame is that the image quality of the original movie is pretty dang good (it's also good on the disc released by Elite. The one without the new scenes. Hint hint.) There is a boatload of extras, including a documentary on the making of the new footage (which actually manages to be worse than the new footage itself), a trailer for this rerelease, and a clip of something called ""Flesheater"" that the director of the new version made.

Thanks to countless reviews on Amazon, I avoided the '30th Anniversary Edition"" which is supposed to be a butchering of the original cut.  I decided against the Elite version because it was too expensive, and would have kicked myself if I hated the movie when it arrived.
After watching my chosen ""Good Times"" DVD, I am glad I spent the very low amount to buy this movie.  While the transfer isn't brilliant, it's far from poor.  It's watchable, and the original soundtrack is satisfactory.  The movie itself ended up not really being my cup of tea so I'm glad I didn't opt for the Elite expensive version.

My friend attests to going to the drive in with a girl when it first came out, and being so riveted to the screen, he never got around to the girl! This surely should be a testament of how incredible this film is, especially for its budget.
NOTLD utilizes in some scenes, purportedly real animal intestines acquired from a local butcher shop. The effect is fantastic!

473927,3,6302484367,"Here's the movie that revolutionized a flm genre and maybe even the film business.  This 1968 black-and-white shocker was made for nothing in the outskirts of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and went on to become a huge hit.  After ""NOTLD,"" horror movies would get grittier and gorier, and independent films suddenly became viable money-making propositions.  For better or for worse.
35 years after its release, NOTLD is still a wonder of economic storytelling (literally and otherwise).  The action begins almost immediately -- we're maybe five minutes into the picture before that first zombie appears, killing a young woman's brother and  chasing her until she finds refuge in a farmhouse.  She's soon joined by six other folks -- they've had run-ins with zombies too.  They should all band together to fight off the ever-growing horde of zombies massing outside, but they can't stop fighting each other.
That's pretty much it.  Call it a horror haiku.
NOTLD is also an interesting product of its time.  Race is clearly an issue -- our hero is a black man, the only one in the film -- and the general tone is one of frustration and pessimism.  The surprise ending even recalls the nihilistic French thriller ""Wages of Fear.""  This is a world gone crazy, and if you get a break, chances are it won't last.
There are also great moments of high camp in all this, of course -- most notably the news broadcasts our heroes watch for updates on the zombies' progress.  ""They're dead,"" explains a zombie-slaying sheriff to a reporter, ""They're all messed up.""
You can probably find a better DVD edition of this film -- hence my three-star rating.  The interactive trivia game feature is techically interesting but brief, and *really* easy.  There's one text biography (of the lead actor), one lobby card reproduction, and a list of credits.

Why, is anyone's guess. The prologue, in which the cemetery zombie climbs out of his coffin just before he can be buried, destroys the impact of the scene that formerly opened the film.

473946,5,6302484367,"If ever there was a candidate for the most frightening film ever made, ""Night of the Living Dead"" would rank near the top.  George A. Romero's classic 1968 zombie film manages to be two things, a terrifying horror film, and a disturbing character study.
Siblings Barbara and Johnny are visiting their father's grave out in the countryside.  Johnny is bored and is complaining to Barbara about the long drive, when their peaceful day takes a frightening turn.  Johnny starts to joke that the lumbering old man towards them is ""coming to get you, Barbara.""  A moment later, the old man really does attack Barbara.  Johnny manages to wrest the man from Barbara, only to be knocked unconscious when he bashes his head on, appropriately enough, a tombstone.
Barbara flees the old man until she comes to an abandoned house in the country, where she locks herself inside.  Observing outside the window, she notices two more ghouls lurching in the same way as the first one outside the house.  A black man named Ben shows up and helps Barbara to nail up the doors and windows.  Several more people show up at the house including a bickering couple named Harry and Helen and their daughter Karen, and a teenage couple named Tom and Judy.
Outside, the ghouls continue to inrease in numbers laying siege to the house.  On the radio and television set, it is announced that the recently deceased are rising from the dead and feasting on the living.  It seems that this occurence is linked to a probe returning from Venus that was carrying a high level of radiation.  The radiation appears to reactivate the brain of a recently dead person.  The only way to stop the ghoul is to burn if or shoo it in the head.
From here on, the film becomes as much a character study as a horror film.  As the seven strangers struggle to survive against the increasing army of the undead, they must learn to cope with each other as well.  This becomes increasingly difficult as Ben and Harry take an instant and intense dislike of one another.  Harry is a cowardly, bullying man who likes to boss other people around even as he himself remains irrational.  Ben, in contrast, is a brave man who cares about people other than himself and is determined to survive.  However, he is not without flaws himself, as we find out in the end.  Helen is Harry henpecking wife who has had quite enough of Harry's selfish behaviour.  Tom is the peacemaker of the group.  Judy basically just sits around looking pretty.  Barbara is in shock from her brother's death and is unable to do anything.  Karen has been bitten by one of the ghouls, causing her to become increasingly catatonic.
In some ways, the title seems to refer as much to the living people as it does to the dead people.  The living people are more interested in arguing amongst themselves than in figuring out how to survive.  The emotionless broadcasters can only give out unhelpful advice.  The national guard, whose job it is to dispose of the zombies, are made up of slow-witted rednecks who shoot at anything that moves.  The zombies' bodies may be dead, but at least their brains are working.  With the living people, it's the other way around.  The living people are the real zombies.
Romero's film seems to tap into the era that it was made, the late sixties, in its depiction of the chaos of the time.  The living people's hopeless battle against the zombies can be compared to American soldiers' hopeless battle against the Viet Cong.  The film can also be seen as an allegory on the current state of America during the Vietnam era.  The way the guardsmen dispose of the zombies brings to mind the clashes between the hippies and the police.
NOTLD was shot on an extremely low budget with cameras that often look as though they were hand held.  This helps give the film a feeling of gritty realism.  It was shot in low quality black and white, which further adds to the nightmarish look.  The zombie makeup was simple but effective.  The gore was quite extreme for the time, and will likely make a lot of people's stomaches churn even today.  Frankly, I'm not a big fan of excessive gore in horror films as I think much of it is unnecessary.  Some of the best horror films like Psycho and Halloween build suspense through suggestion rather than depiction.  If you find the gore in this film difficult to stomach, I don't suggest you see the sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead"".  The gore in that film is ten times more graphic, and it's in glowing technicolor.
I recommend that viewers be very careful about which version of the film that they get, as there are many inferior prints.  Some version to beware of include the 1990 remake, butchered colourized versions, and especially the thirtieth anniversary edition.  The millennium edition DVD is said to be a good buy, although I have yet to see it.  However, I am told that this version cleans up a lot of the grain, improving the picture's quality.  This may not be a good idea, as the murky black and white added to the film's claustrophobic feel.

I just couldn't wait to go home and put it into my VCR. As soon as the film started it hit me that I didn't have a clue what anyone was saying. By the end of the film I was ready to go to sleep.

Okay...as I'd feared, my negative review of the John Russo-massacred ""30th Anniversary Edition"" of Night of the Living Dead has been lumped unwittingly into this product's review, so I' m writing this one to clarify.
This DVD edition is the best edition I've seen of the film yet. Anchor Bay may have raised the ires of legions of Living Dead fans by releasing the sacrilegious 30th Anniversary Edition, but Elite Entertainment did right by this new edition.
George A. Romero's personal appreciation appears in the back of this DVD -- this immediately restores our faith. And the contents don't disappoint -- the picture and sound are good, and though this doesn't exactly contain the richest batch of bonus materials (sets like the excellent 3-disc edition of Dario Argento's Suspiria and the recent double-disc Re-Animator both feature loads of extras), it is a nice solid collection. You get a Duane Jones interview (sadly with only audio and no image, but still great); an on-camera chat between Judith Ridley (Judy) and Marilyn Eastman (Helen); the hilarious student-film spoof ""Night of the Living Bread"" by Kevin S. O'Brien (which also appeared in the double-cassette VHS edition); two commentary tracks with Romero, Russo, Russ Streiner, Eastman, Karl Hardman and others. One very illuminating portion of this DVD for non-film-scholars is visually boring but informative -- several histories outlining the beginning of Romero's Latent Image company, on Hardman and Eastman's company, and how the two were married to produce Night of the Living Dead.
THIS is the right edition of Night of the Living Dead, the one to get for both fans and non-fans alike. It includes all the necessary people (notice that Russo, Streiner and Bill Hinzman were included in this release, despite their criminal participation in the 30th Anniversary Edition), and it presents the film the way it wants to be seen.
Now I'm waiting for a deluxe release of Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead...",1026604800,183,2065,5.058651026392962
473966,2,6302484367,"This 30th Anniversary Edition takes the original Night of the Living Dead movie and throws in a new soundtrack and new scenes. As far as I was concerned, the original movie was perfect as is and this was unnecessary, however I decided to be openminded and give this edition a chance considering that the new material was written by John Russo (who co-wrote the original movie), and has photography (and acting) by Hinzman (who also helped create the original).  I was completely let down.
The new scenes include a new introduction, miscellaneous scenes of zombies marching and getting killed by rednecks, and a new epilogue.  The miscellaneous scenes sometimes interfere with the flow of the movie, the makeup is less effective, and some of the new extras are terrible.  They do a half decent job of editing in the new scenes, but they are still noticeable (for example, the fashions are not quite right).  The new introduction and epilogue are ridiculous.
The intro merely establishes that the lead zombie (played by Hinzman) was a criminal when alive. This takes away from one of the films most effective elements: that the zombies could be your next door neighbour or a close friend or relative, but they will still mindlessly try to kill you. Hinzman is obviously older in the frontal shots (the profiles are okay).  When he starts attacking two gravediggers, one of the ""actors"" begins running away then realizes Hinzman was supposed to grab him first, so he actually goes back to the coffin and leans down so Hinzman can grab him!!!  The fact they didn't do a second take shows a lack of care.
The epilogue is a ""one year later"" interview with an insane hellfire and brimstone preacher who survived the carnage.  It is stuck in the middle (spoiler warning) of the scene of Duane Jones being killed and the ending credits showing the rednecks disposing of his body!!  Talk about interfering with a very effective ending!
You do have the option to watch the original cut (on an excellent print), but you can only watch it with the new soundtrack! The old soundtrack was made up of library music, but it worked excellently.  At best, the new soundtrack is mediocre.  Sometimes it doesn't even fit the mood of the scene, for example being frantic when the action is more sedate and depressive.
The booklet contains interviews mostly consisting of the actors talking about how ""flawlessy"" the new scenes were added and how old fans will love the new version (wrong).  There is a fun commentary track, but you get the same people (plus others, including Romero) giving the same info on the commentary tracks in the far superior Elite Millennium Edition.",1026345600,5,2653,4.8215859030837

473989,1,6302484367,"This review pertains only to the ""30th Anniversary Edition"".
I had been collecting George A. Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy on DVD and had purchased this without paying enough attention.  Big mistake.
Night of the Living Dead has had some colossally confusing release patterns thanks to a copyright gaffe which had enabled every company under the sun to release the film and profit from it.  But of the 'rogue editions' I've seen, nothing is worse than this one.
Notice the list of personnel involved in this project:  John Russo, Russ Streiner, Bill Hinzman...anybody missing?  That's right:  George A. Romero himself.  This ""30th Anniversary"" edition is a collaborated effort by Romero's former colleagues in the Night of the Living Dead crew to rip off Romero's work and make a profit from it.
The result is disastrous indeed.  The new footage written and directed by John Russo serve to butcher the original film.  Not only do the new scenes not contribute to the story, they look amateurish, mostly due to horrible writing.  Russo had always wanted to claim more credit for the success of Night of the Living Dead than was due him; this attempt at appropriating credit for the original film only shows that Romero is the only one who understands the concept of the Living Dead films.  Russo's heinous, childish writing and direction -- which are no better than that of the tongue-in-cheek soft-core videographers of, say, Seduction Cinema -- barely rise above the level of beginner film students.  And his claim that the new footage matches the old is just ludicrous.  Basically Streiner, Russo, Hinzman et al. have raped Romero's film, trying to use their involvement in the original to steal credit from Romero's work, desperately trying to put as much of their handprint onto the original as possible with this 'new footage'.  Well, one minute watching Dawn of the Dead will show you that Romero was the filmmaker, and the others were the hacks.
Yet another guilty party in this whole enterprise is Scott Vladimir Licina, who had composed a new score for the film and plays a priest in the new scenes.  The new score jars terribly with the old footage, and Licina's acting is atrocious -- reflective of the all-around low quality of the Russo footage.
Skip this one, crucify it, and leave it out for the zombies to chew on.  This edition is a disgrace to Romero's legacy.  Night of the Living Dead is one of the greatest horror films ever made; don't allow this sacrilegious edition to mislead your perception on the original film.",1025740800,40,2539,4.883449883449884

473991,5,6302484367,"Those who have seen NOTLD usually claim that it is one of the scariest if not the scariest horror film of all time.  The reasons most often mentioned include the grainy black and white pseudo-documentary filming, the heretofore unbroken taboo of onscreen cannabalism, the bold decision to use a black man as the protagonist, and the dreary ordinariness of the zombies.  Certainly, the sum of these factors makes it easy to tag this film as something special in the horror genre.  Yet for NOTLD, the whole is somehow more than the sum of its parts.  There are other films in other genres that had talented directors consciously try tactics that would appeal to the immediate senses of the viewer.  What separates the merely effective film from the truly memorable one is what the director presents as lurking beneath the surface.  In the horror genre, Alfred Hitchcock is the acknowledged master of the subconscious demon that lurks in us all. George Romero, the director of NOTLD, surely runs a close second. What Romero manages to do in NOTLD is similar to what Ridley Scott managed a decade later in ALIEN.  Romero knew that walls and claustrophobia often interact on the screen to produce a creepy feeling in the audience.  In fact, walls and wall-breaking become the central metaphor of this film. As the movie opens, a zombie attacks a woman who seeks safety in her car.  The zombie tries to break in by smashing the car's window. The woman seeks safety in a house, and with the aid of other normal humans, seeks to buttress the structural integrity of the house by using nails and boards.  Soon enough a horde of slow-moving corpses tries to smash into the house.  Eventually they succeed. The grotestque climax occurs when the recently murdered brother of the woman reaches through a smashed door and drags his poor screaming sister out into the night to be devoured.  The cumulative impact of this scene scares the viewer on more than one level.  The horror of seeing a sister ripped apart by her ghoul brother is surely nasty enough, but Romero amplifies this grotesqueness by suggesting that the malevolent events of this movie are nothing more than an exaggeration of a fundamental principle of life--that the order and stability of this universe has only the thinnest of gossamer protection against the terror and chaos that exists just inches from that wall. It is almost as if Romero is suggesting that the nightmares which afflict us all are only glimpses into that anarchic nada which preceeded the origins of our universe.  If a nightmare glimpse scares the ordinary individual, then, he shows on the screen what the grim reality of a wall collapse must be like.  This other nightmare universe sucks us into its foul regions where the dead are not dead at all.  By the end of the film, the audience is forced to see that the dramatic focus of the title is not on the living at all, but on the dead.  And it is this soul-shaking divination that causes a new generation of audiences to continually reappraise the sometimes elusive distinction between that which is dead and that which is not.",1023235200,3,3107,4.777570093457944

474009,5,6302484367,"One Saturday afternoon my parents went out and left me in the house all alone, and they had just bought me a copy of Night of the Living Dead to keep me busy. I rarely get scared at black and white horror films (Exception-Psycho) but this movie had me jumping around like a fool by the end. Night of the Living Dead was directed by George A Romero who hit with two other sequels in this same field. Shot on a shoe string budget of just over,$110,000,it is the story of the dead coming back to life and eating the living. However that is just the start. In the beginning we meet Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) and they are attacked in a cemetery where they have come to put flowers on there fathers grave. After Johnny is killed Barbara runs to a nearby farm house. A man passes in looking for gas named Ben (Duane Jones) and he decides that they should just stay put and board up the house for protection. More people show up like the cantancorous Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman),his long suffering wife Helen (Mayilyn Eastman),their daughter who had been bitten by a ghoul, and a young couple who is just scared. Ben and Harry hate one another from the outset and continue to fight throughout the film.
Night of the Living Dead works on many different levels and in the end it is just a really good horror movie, but it also say's somthing about the fact that no matter how bad things are outside, inside we still can't get along. The acting is very good,(Eastman,Hardman,And Streiner all worked off camera as well and were there from the biggining) and the violence is not very graphic although it is at time a little disturbing but if you see Dawn Of The Dead or Day Of The Dead, or even the remake of this film you will be amazed at just how tame it is compared to those others. This is the film that started all the zombie movies and it has never come close to being equeled. Most of the Zombie movies that come out now are nothing more than an excuse show how much blood and gore they can pack into 97 Minutes (See Lucio Fulci's Zombie if you don't believe me).
A remake made of thius film in the early 90's by make-up wizard Tom Savini that was a really bad movie. He should have left well enough alone and remade Plan 9 From Outer Space, at least then we would have seen his movie being intentionally funny........",1019865600,2,2352,4.359908883826879

I do, after all, own some nine different copies of it, on CD, VHS and DVD, all of which contain some technical details that are awful in their own special way.  When I finally got this item, however, I was completely blown away within seconds of the film starting.  The restoration work from the original 35mm print really shows a lot of love went into this project.  It is utterly beautiful.  There is so much detail and depth in the image now, it's amazing.  The film no longer looks like an amateurish 8 or 16mm, scratched to bits nightmare.  It looks like what it really is, a classic.
The extra features, from Stephen King's great liner notes to the superb commentaries and interviews, are fantastic.  The new 5.1 audio track is pretty excellently realized as well, giving a new dimension to this classic.  The original mono track is included as well.

474012,4,6302484367,"I'll never forget that night...a cold October night...a night that would forever change the way I would come to view horror films as a genre...
I was 13 years old.  It was 3:00 A.M., late Friday night/early Saturday morning.  I was the only person in the house still awake, the rest of my family had gone to bed hours earlier.  With all the lights out, I made myself comfortable, lying down on the living room sofa, my only ""companion""...a television set, which crackled and hummed to life with a mere pressing of the ""power"" button located on the remote control that resided in my hand.
Now, I'd always been a huge fan of horror films, but had never thought of myself as being a person that could actually become frightened as a result of having viewed one.  I was wrong.  The two hours that were to follow would come to be, for me, the most tense, pulse-pounding and, ultimately, terrifying two hours spent watching a motion picture...
The film...director George A. Romero's original, unforgettable cult classic...""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD""!
Mr. Romero's nightmarish tale of seven strangers trapped and isolated inside an old Pennsylvanian farmhouse by an army of grossly disfigured, cannibalistic corpses, has been terrifying audience members, old and young alike, for nearly 35 years now, and will continue to do so for a long time to come.  From its ominous beginning to its shocking conclusion, ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a true horror film masterpiece...taut with nerve-shattering tension and nail-biting suspense!
Unleashed upon an unsuspecting public in the winter of 1968, ""Night of the Living Dead"" quickly became one of the most successful independent horror films ever to be released and eventually led to the completion of two follow-up features, ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1979) and ""Day of the Dead"" (1985), a color remake in 1990, and ""Document of the Dead"", an insightful, and thoroughly entertaining, behind-the-scenes documentary recorded primarily upon location during the actual filming of ""Dawn of the Dead"".
A now infamous 30th anniversary edition of ""Night of the Living Dead"" was issued direct-to-video via the Anchor Bay company in the summer of 1999, but instead of glorifying the motion picture in all its cinematic splendor, the video's producers decided to cut and re-edit the film, trimming portions of classic footage and music in favor of inserting pieces of new, and highly absurd, footage and music that serve only to detract from the viewer the feelings of sheer terror and suspense that come with viewing the original version in its entirety.",1017619200,,2576,5.035211267605634

474014,5,6302484367,"Wow! What a picture! Last night, after chumming around with a few friends of mine at the country club,I returned home at 3 A.M, prepared to enter into soporific delight when, suddenly, I felt this strange and undeniable urge to turn on my wide screen television set! Thus, I searched frantically for my remote control, and finally when my patience was nearly at an end, I located the remote underneath my alligator skin suitcase. Quickly, I turned on my TV set [$$$],and there before me loomed a haunting image I shall not too quickly forget: a decrepit female corpse eating the brains of a young man who had the terrible misfortune of stumbling into the wrong graveyard at the wrong time! What an interesting concept! Corpses clawing their way through the soil that separates them from the ground level above and their eternal resting places below. But, the Zombie-like corpses have not returned to the land of the living for mere pleasure, of course! NO, they are on a zealous mission to remove from the world as many functioning brains as possible! Clearly, this story is an allegory, or a parable, if you will.  It reminds one of the brain-removing procedures of the epic film ""Planet of the Apes,"" but, of course, the story is really meant to symbolize the communist forces at work in this world, and the cannibalistic nature of ideological disease that is Marxism.
Communism is predicated on the principle that men have an inalienable right to another person's labor, property, and ideas. Sometimes, as the purges of Stalinist Russia demonstrated, a bloodbath is necessary to destroy perceived threats to collectivist dogma. Hence, what is the destruction of 60 million Russians to a nation that simply desires to cultivate a zombie-like populace, unthinking, unfeeling, uncaring: dead to all humanly ambitions except the advancement of their anti-human ideology! Indeed, Free thinkers are not welcome in the graveyard of collectivist ideas! I recommend this movie to the free thinkers of this world! Bolsheviks beware!",1016841600,,2025,5.044776119402985
474015,5,6302484367,"Elite's new ""Millennium Edition"" DVD of the 1968 horror classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD includes all of the material from Elite's 1997 DVD edition, plus a few more extras from Elite's '94 laserdisc edition.  Both Elite DVDs contain the original unedited version of the film.
The video transfer of the Millennium Edition (ME) looks to be identical to that of the '97 DVD version.  To those who haven't seen either edition, the THX-certified video transfer is simply immaculate.  Made from original negatives, the transfer has a kind of sharpness, clarity, and contrast that are, according to director George Romero himself, superior even to the print used for the film's original theatrical release.  The mono audio is clean and strong, and it sounds identical in both editions except it's in Dolby Digital 1.0 on the '97 edition, but 2.0 on the ME.  There is also a mildly effective Dolby Digital 5.1 track on the ME.
The two audio commentary tracks (recorded circa '94) from the LD edition have been duplicated on the '97 and ME DVDs.  All the principals except Duane Jones are featured, with the actors on one track and the director/producers on the other.  Although the commentaries resemble a jovial get-together for the most part, they do provide considerable details about the making of the film -- the casting of Duane Jones was strictly color-blind, the Barbara character was originally to survive, the filmmakers managed to obtain a helicopter for free for some of the scenes, etc.  The commentators also provide many insights to their crafts.  For instance, co-producer/actor Karl Hardman says he decided he should play Mr. Cooper in a more demonstrative manner after seeing Jones' calmer portrayal of Ben.
Compensating for the lack of Duane Jones in the commentaries, the ME DVD includes a 16-minute audio excerpt of a 1988 interview of him.  In it, he expresses his gratitude for associating with the film, but stresses his need for privacy and anonymity.  He recalls an amusing anecdote in which two people who sat next to him argued whether he was really Duane Jones.  When they concluded that he WASN'T, he wasn't the least bit inclined to correct them.  This interview was to be Jones' last, and he would pass away later that year.
The ME DVD also includes a 10-minute video segment of an interview of Judy Ridley (who played Judy), who provides more anecdotes from the film as well as her experiences before, during and after the making of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  The interviewer is co-producer Marilyn Eastman.
The other extras on the ME DVD include eight TV commercials made by Romero and company (the '97 DVD has only four), a 5-minute clip of Romero's followup film THERE'S ALWAYS VANILLA that features then-couple Judy Ridley and Russ Streiner, a few production photos from VANILLA, the hilarious 8-minute 1990 parody film ""Night of the Living Bread"" (in which Barbara is a brunette, Ben is shorter and chubbier, and hundreds of slices of what could truly be called ""wonder bread"" are used) that is also on the '97 DVD, text material on the history of the filmmakers, and the original shooting script (which spans over 300 frames).  The shooting script is preceded by a brief rough draft which indicates the film was originally intended to be a comedy.  Rounding out the extras is a ""Scrapbook"" section containing 100 or so still frames of memorabilia collected by the filmmakers, including correspondences, photos, newspaper clippings, etc.
Both the '97 and ME DVDs are all-region and without subtitles and closed captioning.",1016755200,20,3552,4.964586846543002

Yes, green.
I didn't watch more than ten minutes of that version, and I should've stopped at about the same minute count with this ""30th Anniversary"" version.
The added prologue, epilogue and additional scenes (which weren't cut from the original film, but recently filmed for inclusion here) not only fail to make any significant contribution to ""NOTLD,"" they actually DETRACT from it.
For instance, why would you want to mute one of the most chilling openings in film history? I'm referring, of course, to the opening scene where the main undead character slowly ambles up to the bickering brother and sister, eventually killing the brother.
That scene, however, no longer opens the movie. Now, we get a couple of country bumpkins going off to bury a corpse.
The new material is warped not only by poor writing -- the additional material serves NO PURPOSE to the story -- but abysmal acting.
Despite its budgetary constraints, the original ""NOTLD"" had some decent acting. Duane Jones in particular does a terrific job. This new version contains some performances so terrible as to incite its own form of terror: ""NOTLBA"" (""Night of the Living Bad Actors"")

I'm going to keep it in a drawer in good condition in the hopes that one day I'll at least be able to break even when some poor sap wants to laugh at it and pay good money for it.
That all being said.  WOW!  George summed it up in the first minutes of his commentary by expressing his hope that this was, finally, the definitive version of his masterpiece.  The new transfer is nothing short of amazing (espescially considering all that have come before).  The levels of detail that can be seen, combined with the quality of the source material have rendered a thing of beauty the likes of which probably haven't been seen since the editing bay.
I took a chance and listened to the new 5.1 sound mix and I wasn't disappointed.  It still feels very much like a mono mix, but there's a better ambience.  Purists such as myself will also want to check out the original mono mix.
I was a little put off by the presentation of the extras at first, but of course I'm lazy.  They require lots of >> pushing and sometimes the scans lack enough detail to be able to read.  Give yourself a little time, however, and you'll be greeted with a wealth of information about this film.
Of particular interest to me were his (admittedly somewhat buried) TV commercials.  They're well worth digging for.
As for the commentary tracks, I have only listened to the one by George, John Russo, producer Karl Hardman (Harry Cooper) and Marylin Eastman (Helen Cooper).  This is commentary just how I like it: very technical when it needs to be and very anecdotal and full of the kind of trivia that only a group of close friends can do.  Did you know that Judy O'Dea (Barbara) has been doing make-up and food styling?  I sure as hell didn't, but it's great to know.  It certainly explains that element of her performance where she's basically fondling the sets.  I know she was playing catatonia to the hilt, but please... Oh well, it all makes sense now. [No offense, Judy.  My ex and I cite your performance all the time!  We love ya.]

474039,5,6302484367,"Night of the Living Dead (George A. Romero, 1968)

How many records has this movie broken, and how influential has it been? Night of the Living Dead is, arguably, the last film to date to have so  radically changed the face of filmmaking as we know it. Love it, hate it, be indifferent to it, one unarguable fact remains: Night of the Living Dead is the single most influential film of all time, if for no other reason because it was the  catalyst that sparked the induction of the MPAA ratings system. In other words, every film made in America since 1969 has been influenced by Night of the Living Dead.

There is quite a bit of debate about what really caused the folks in Hollywood to get up in arms about this movie. The obvious one is the violence.  There are a number of scenes in this movie (that number varies depending on two whom you're talking; I count three, but most people would add at least two more) that, for 1968, were pushing the envelope of onscreen violence. I tend  to keep the number at three because I don't think it's just the violence in those scenes that affected people so much, I think it's the subtexts behind the violence. Ben (Duane Jones) jamming the business end of a tire iron  through a zombie's skull is violent, perhaps egregiously so, but it doesn't carry the delayed-reaction shock of the movie's most extended scene of violence, that of the zombies eating the body parts of those who died in the truck  explosion. Cannibalism scares us more than murder does, and on more levels. Add in
the ending, which may be the finest in film history (I can't imagine there's anyone out there who doesn't know the ending, but I'll refrain just in  case); you have something that disturbs from top to toe.

But was the violence really the reason this film was so outrageous? Or could it have been the sociopolitical subtexts within the film? After all, the  idea that a black man could be the protagonist of a film, making all the right decisions where the older, middle aged white guy is making all the wrong ones, was a dangerous precedent in 1968. Worse yet, the black man is protecting a white  woman. Add in a spark of sexual tension between Ben and Barbara (Judith O'Dea), and you come up with something that surely raised a whole lot of hackles. You could certainly keep going in this vein, adding in the film's  subtexts of matricide/fratricide, cannibalism, incest, and other things of which most people are more scared than the surface aspects of the film. There's certainly a strong case to be made for this argument, probably a stronger one than  for the surface violence itself. Then you add the coup de grace--Romero is taking all this stuff, pointing at the zombies, and saying ""this is America."" That didn't become painfully obvious until eleven years later, when he did  the same thing a bit more nakedly in Dawn of the Dead. But the subtext was always there, we just couldn't see it.

There is a third possibility, and from a cynical viewpoint it makes the most sense. Perhaps one reason the film inspired such outrage was that it  circumvented the system. It not only did so and succeeded, but it succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of anyone involved with the making of the film, and beyond the deepest nightmares of anyone within the system that shunned it. Much  of the stark feel of Night of the Living Dead comes from its low-budget feel. The sound recording is bad, the film stock is low-quality black and white, the camera is jerky and inconsistently applied. (Note the influence of Night  of the Living Dead, in this, on films as disparate as The Blair Witch Project, Raging Bull, and Trespass.) None of this was done for artistic credibility, it was done because the film had been shunned by Hollywood, and Romero and  co. were scraping up pennies as they went. They did what they could afford to do. And even after they completed it, the Hollywood machine took one look and laughed. So they distributed it independently. Twenty-five years after  its release, the film was still playing Saturday midnight showings in some of the same theaters where it first appeared. Aside from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, there's no other film in history that can make that claim.

It should go without saying that the very things that caused the Hollywood system to turn its back on Romero's first, and still finest, movie are the  exact same things that have drawn moviegoers to it for some thirty-five years now, and keep us watching the movie again and again. Never mind that the film the X rating was created for would barely merit a PG-13 today, never mind that  the movie has so pervaded our culture that even those who have never seen it will know half the lines and a quarter of the scenes already (how many people living in America today over the age of twelve, whether they've  seen the movie or not, won't have faces that light up with recognition upon hearing ""they're coming to get you, Barbara!""?), never mind that the film is predictable. We keep watching, and we will continue to keep watching,  because we recognize (or most of us do, anyway) that Night of the Living Dead is the Gutenberg Bible, the Model A, the Carl Yastremzski of filmdom. It's been done since, and it's arguably been done better since, but it's so much a  part of us that we can't help but look at it with respect and affection. It is still, and will always remain, the finest horror film ever made. *****",1014681600,4,5438,4.596690796277146

To be honest, this version doesn't cost that much (...) and because of that, you aren't getting many extras.  The sound is pretty bad, but the picture is clean and free of artifacts.  The included extras are bios on some of the actors, a screenshot of the poster on the front of the DVD case and a rather pointless ""interactive"" trivia game which asks you a question, and regardless if you're right or wrong, it plays a segment from the scene in the question.  No deleted scenes, commentary, or any other cool features which we've become accustomed to seeing in our DVD's.  It should be noted that the text in the bios features is a bit on the small side and can be hard to read on anything less than a composite video output.
The price is right and any movie lover (and video gamer who has played the Resident Evil series) should add this to their collection.

The only thing that's sharply in focus on this version of NOTLD is the splicy, dusty film surface itself. The manufacturer must have used either a beat-up duplicate or a VHS tape for a master. But you would never suspect it from the slick packaging, along with the assurances of ""Dolby Digital Stereo"" and, on the disc itself (from UAV Corp.), ""Guaranteed Superior Quality.""

Was this the real cause for the dead returning from the grave to  feeding on the flesh of the living? Well, at least that is what we are led to believe. Seven strangers are trapped in an isolated farmhouse struggling with the horror that awaits them on the outside and the tension that will eventually destroy them on the inside.
They quickly learn the only want to stop these creature is a blow to the head, preferably from a bullet, or to set them on fire. These zombies are slow moving and very defeatable, but their human counterparts are more worried about arguing over who's in charge than fighting back. The tension in this film is tremendous and I even find myself sometimes rooting for the zombies. Is that so wrong???
This low-budget cult-classic set the standards for modern horror. The zombies are simple, but effective. The filming in b&w truly adds to the atmosphere. The score is standard music library material, but very eerie.  Romero is one of the few directors that can take a chance with this type of ending and succeed, too bad he didn't do the same with Dawn Of The Dead.

474066,2,6302484367,"There's always the sequel, or the remake, or the adaptation that somehow negatively affects the reputation of a classic film, book, etc. The Batman films became progressively worse, the remake of ""Psycho"" was just a pointless exercise (and pricey one) in filmmaking, and the 1995 adaptation of ""The Scarlet Letter"" was just an out and out disgrace. Then of course, there's the 30th anniversary edition of ""NOTLD"", with newly remastered sound and picture quality. Not to mention 15 minutes of newly shot scenes that are an inclusion to the film. Well, there's the old adage, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. But instead of not fixing it, how about tossing a molotov cocktail at the film and screw it up with bad acting and campy, Cinemax premiere-style storytelling to an otherwise, horror classic. Romero's 1968 film made a big fuss when it burst onto the drive-in scene by giving unexpecting viewers images they'd never forget in the midst of horrible violence. It was the first time where the hero does not win in the end, where censorship was sorely tested, and people didn't expect what they'd see. Now, countless versions of video and DVD later, the team from the original (with the strange exclusion of writer-director Romero) have teamed up, to pretty much tarnish the reputation of the original, with a ridiculous subplot surrounding the first zombie we see in the film, and an even worse character, an idiot playing a priest who would put most porn stars to shame for being such an awful actor. These 15 minutes of deleted scenes excise the original scenes, [mess] up the ending, and are most likely to hurt the reputation of the classic. The only thing the 30th anniversary has is an engrossing score that provides remarkable improvement to the original score by making it tense and scary. But the extras, which have absolutely nothing to do with the 1968 original, are just from the production surrounding the 30th anniversary. An annoying music video accompanies the likes of the DVD that's a techno version which unnecessarily repeats quotes from the flick that make it unbearable. If you're a big fan of NOTLD, and look to purchase the original, just purchase the original which you can find for less than 10 bucks on the internet. Don't get the 30th anniversary, because it certainly isn't definitive, and it certainly isn't good. Instead, pick up the Millenium Edition, which for some reason is being paired with this review instead of the actual 30th Anniversary Edition, the one that's being criticized.",1009497600,,2521,4.92018779342723

I liked the way that Barbra sought refuge first with her brother, to no avail, then in her car, again without success, and then in the house. This is a good way of building up the fear and the audience's knowledge of the power of the ghouls. It is worth noting that in a crisis such as this the danger might not come from the so called baddies, but from the idiots who are supposed to be on your side. There are some nicely composed shots but the overall effect is spoiled by poor editing that often gives the effect of jump cuts. The acting is variable. It's lucky that Duane Jones is reasonably good, because the main female lead Judith O'Dea is awful.  Having said that, the overall effect is quite clever, with feelings of relentless attack and claustrophobia heightened by the old farm house setting. The creatures' origins are explained in a radio broadcast which must be a homage to Orson Welles's version of H.G.Wells's War Of The Worlds, and the television broadcasts seem quite realistic too. It's worth noting that nowhere in this film is the term 'Zombies' used, these are just recently dead people who came back to life and started committing murders!

The night of terror eradicates every possible source of comfort (and for the viewer as well).

474070,5,6302484367,"I always thought that ""Night of the Living Dead"" was one of the scariest and most original horror films of the 1960s.  The idea is so primal: humans cornered by predators (in this case, the living dead) with no real hope for rescue.  Even worse,  the group breaks down even faster due to a heartbreaking rescue attempt gone wrong.
Many feel that the poor quality of the prints usually available reduces the impact.  I didn't necessarily agree with this view, and I thought that NOTLD had a newsreel feel to it.  Until one kind soul sent me a copy of the Elite version.
Toss your previous VHS, 20th and 30th anniversary monstrosities and prepare to be reintroduced to ""Night"".  It's so CLEAR, and even the sound is improved. You can see details like the calendar in the living room (1966), and even the infamous continuity-numbered boards used to block off the front door.  It's just stunning, and it's a treat for those who love this film.
But wait! There's more!  Not one but TWO commentary tracks by Romero, Russo and many of the actors.  A pity they couldn't be together...but I think that personal differences over rights, compensation, Return of the Living Dead have probably strained relations over the years.  But it just gives this DVD even more replayability, and all of the participants have something to add.  Judy O'Dea, who I never have heard from in TV or print, adds much to the commentary that is new.  You get the impression that she hasn't done a lot of acting since that roel (and she even says as much). Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman are great as commentators and professional filmakers/editors.  A pity that Duane Jones has passed on, I would have loved to hear him speak about this experience.

I can type all day about the offenses this film spewed upon its viewers, but let's narrow it down to a few:
 1.  When a movie's done, it's done.  Don't add to it, don't punch it up.  It's done.  You want to continue to ride on the success of a film, make a sequel, or if you're lazy enough make a remake.  Lucas almost killed Star Wars, these knuckleheads should have learned their lessons.
  2.  What was with that bald priest?  Did they have auditions or did Russo lose a bet?
  3.  Bill Hinzman: You've AGED!
  4. What was with that bald priest?
  5.  Part of the alure of the original was the graininess, the grittiness of the film.  Having that removed was no more than pure idiocy.
  6.  I can't believe they changed the score.  Granted it was stock music, but like the graininess of the film, it added to the atmosphere.  To make matters worse, they let the bald priest write the new Music... Which quite frankly, I could have written if someone had lent me their keyboard from 1987.
  7. What was with that ending?  I mean come on!  What did it mean?  That only bald, buck-toothed priests will be saved.  If that's the case, sprinkle me with salt and feed me to the zombies.
I can go on, but the truth is is that this film had no redeeming qualities whatsover and I felt that after reading the other reviews posted, this was not clearly stated.  I thank you for your time and have a great day.",1006214400,3,1695,4.292993630573249

A motley group of uncontaminated humans take refuge in an abandoned farmhouse, only to spend a terrifying night battling against an inexorable mob of these ravenous zombies--as well as against each other.
That story line may seem less plausible than those of the many great horror films that have been released since, but George A. Romero's original 1968 edition of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD still stands as one of the scariest movies ever made. Romero's aesthetic use of black-and-white photography, on-location shooting in grim and austere settings, ingenious use of dime-store props, and casting of unknown actors all lend to the film a sense of documentary-like realism, and he masterfully milks from this an atmosphere of gut-wrenching terror and unrelenting despair that is in no way secondary to the gruesomeness of the titular ghouls.  Even after multiple viewings, the disturbingly ironic ending can still unnerve even the most hardened horror aficionado.  And all of this without the graphic gore of today's horror fare.
If at all possible, serious viewers should get hold of the Special Collector's Edition of the DVD (Elite Entertainment). In addition to a beautifully remastered copy of the film, it contains two optional running commentaries--one with Romero and his technical crew, and the other with surviving actors Judith O'Dea, Russell Streiner (who also co-produced), Kyra Schon, et al.  Both commentaries offer humorous anecdotes and interesting insights into the making and interpretation of the movie.

There is also a young couple.
The movie pretty much all takes place in the house, aside from seeing the zombies come at the place in slow motion.
I won't give away what happens but most horror movies do not have happy endings.  The ending was very surprising to me -- kind of funny.
See it for the great direction by George Romero, for the extremely interesting camera work, and especially for the gore, which is pretty tame by today's standards but a bit gory for the 60s'> There is also a bit of nudity in this as one of the female zombies seems to have died naked.

Pretty horrible situation right?Well this film shows how people would truely react and think inside if something like this began happening. This is one of the movies that could not be made in our fake and conformist little teenie bopper society.

Though it's not noted on the box, other scenes came out to make room for the new ones. Probably not the smartest move, because left intact the movie would still be under two hours. Any why cut anything of the original film? New scenes include a new beginning and a new conclusion, and shots of zombies roaming the countryside. One interesting sequence has a family killed in roadside car accident slowly coming back to life. But other than that the new scenes don't seem to fit into the picture very well, and don't seem to do anything to enhance the story. You can tell the difference between the new and old footage. The new beginning includes scenes with the cemetery zombie (Bill Hinzman), and the 30 year difference between his new footage and 1968 footage is painfully obvious. I'm not crazy about the new musical score, either. I thought the original score was more effective, even though George Romero is said to have disliked it. In fact, I wouldn't have tampered with a thing. Shown in full-frame. Also included is the original version, with the new musical score. Extra features include a behind-the-scenes featurette, with cast and crew patting themselves on the back in this endeavor, the theatrical trailer, a still gallery, audio commentary with John A. Russo, Bill Hinzman, Russ Streiner, and Bob Michelucci, a scene from the Bill Hinzman feature ""Flesh Eater"", a ""Dance of the Dead"" music video (don't ask) and 32 page collector's booklet.

I actualy bought the Limited Edition of this version but the only difference is the music CD that is not included with the Standard version.
I highly recommend this version over all others as it included new footage that was originaly in the script but was cut only due to costs. A new socre has ben written which puts the film in the same catagory as the sequals.
If you can find the 30th Anniversary Linited Edition, that is the better value, but it is becoming harder to find.
If you are a die hard fan also get the Elite Special Edition. This is a very no frills version of the original film with no editing.
Read my other reviews on the different version for perseptive.

I wrote a review for the Elite Special Edition as well, so see that too.
I bought this version against reccomendations and was pleasently surprized.
This edition contains 2 versions of the film. The first is the 30th Anniversary version which has new footage that was originaly in the script but was cut due to costs and a new score which is a little overpowered but puts it right in line with the sequals.
The video is fully digitized and is increadibly crisp and clear. The added scenes are fairly unnoticed to the untrained eye and the new score is brilliant and keep the film pace going quite well.
I highly reccomend this version if you can find it because the Limited Edition has an extra CD with the new score.
The booklet is thick and full of interviews and the insert card is colorfull and lists chapters for both versions.
If you are a die hard fan get this AND the Elite Special Edition as that one is a good, no frills, copy of the original film unedited.

If you are just interested in a plain no frills, but great quality copy of the original release, this is it.
The menus are cheesy, there are no inserts or books listing the scene numbers and the DVD does not even have any title on it except for around the the center hole where it says the movie name one side and a note to play the opposite side on the other.
All you get is the case with a nice colored cover and the DVD... PERIOD.
The DVD does include some small commentaries and a funny movie called ""Night of the living bread"", sort of a spoof.
When I first was looking for a good quality copy of this film I read all the reviews for both this one and the 2 30th Anniversary versions.
I bought this one due to all of the suggestions. I was fairly dissapointed, for the money it cost.
I then found the 30th Annaversary (Limited Edition) and bought that and was pleasently surprized.
If you are a die hard fan of the film, as I am, buy both. This will give you literaly 3 different versions of the film. The original, in this version, and 2 others in the 30th Annaversary version.
Buy this only as a last resort, as the 30th Annasversary edition is getting hard to come by, especialy the Limited Edition (see my review for those other 2)

The edition offers two versions of the film, neither of which are original. One is a 1998 version, mostly identical to the '68 cut, but with a new score by a composer of campy 'horror flick' music. This may be a cheap rip-off of the success the ACCLAIMED composer, philip glass, had with re-scoring the original Dracula with bela lugosi, but the new score for Living Dead does nothing but take away from the film's suspense and beauty.
The other version is labled as the 30th Anniversary Edition, with NEW, (not original deleted), scenes. They were filmed recenly, with new technology, so the scened don't mesh well, and they have no bearing on the original plot.

Man, was I wrong.  I just finished watching the 30th Anniversary version of the movie, and it is--like many have already stated here--an excising of 15 minutes of original footage en lieu of some ridiculous padding (an overacting priest, a family in an auto wreck, 'new' zombies wandering the countryside) that in no way adds to the storyline.  Unfortunately, the picture quality of the new footage is inconsistent with the 1968 version, so everything that's been added is unfortunately hard to miss.  The New & Improved soundtrack had me groaning at first, but got better as the film progressed (even though it resembled Tangerine Dream on a cheap keyboard). I must commend whoever re-recorded the sound efx (gunshots, punches, etc.), because that's the one aspect of this edition that's OUTSTANDING.
The extras, which consist of a trailer, a making-of segment, a still gallery, and a pointless video clip from some obscure movie are pretty underwhelming.  This Bill Hinzman guy shouldn't be holding his head up too high for whatever involvement he had here, along with buddy-boy John Russo.
In short, I thought I'd get this and maybe do away with my 10+ year old video copy, but I think I'll stick with it.  By comparison, this is the ""Definitive Inferior Version.""",988243200,13,1496,4.916666666666667

Their 5 star rating they're giving is not for THIS DVD! I don't want to see people confusing this DVD for Elite's DVD and making the mistake of buying this one. You will be cheated into getting a worthless piece of garbage that George Romero had absolutely NO involvement with. It's just an excuse to give the filmakers an ego trip and get their families involved in something they missed the first time around. That, and greed, pure and simple.
If you really must see this edition (if only for comparing it to the original) RENT it. You might get a laugh out of the 15 minutes worth of new footage of actors you don't really care about, apart from the cemetery zombie, looking 30 years older and 30 pounds heavier, which doesn't do anything to add to the story. But mostly what you'll get is disgusted, especially with how much of the original movie they remove. The new ""score"" by Scott Vladimir Lucina doesn't hold a candle to the library music which was used in the original version. There is also an audio commentary with the filmakers applauding their efforts and saying how seamless the new footage is incorporated into the movie. This is far from the truth and they know it, judging from the joking around and the frequent gaps of silence.
The ""98"" edition is equally appalling. It's the original edit of NOTLD, but also the new ""score"" is here in all its' glory. If Anchor Bay would've used the library score on another track there would be less disatisfied viewers (well, I would be, for one). And, contrary to the reviewer below me, there is NO, repeat NO deleted scenes added to this version. In fact, it runs about 50 seconds shorter than Elite Entertainment's version. Go figure.
Oh yeah, the DVD suppliments. A useless theatrical trailer, a behind the scenes featurette that's more boring than your neighbor's home video (which essentially this is), an appalling clip from Flesh Eater, an annoying Dance Of The Dead video that is unintentionally hilarious, and a still gallery accompanied by Lucina's music. Whoop-de-dooo. There is also a ""32-page, 4-color collector's booklet"" about the making of this edition but precious little about making the original.

I had nightmares afterwards about the world being overrun with zombies, and it is still the most scary film I have seen. The beginning of this film is set out brillantly to intimidate and startle us. The music is so menacing, stinging and striking. The black and white desolate setting of the graveyard. A sense of loneliness and helplessness as the zombies engulf the trapped people, and the impending doom for them as it becomes apparent the ghouls are extremely numerous and savage. The bickering and distrust between the trapped people in the farmhouse. The cheap budget of the film adds brilliantly to the effect it has, and just shows how you can make a truly great scary horror film with little financing. A great original horror film that has been imitated, but never surpassed.
This Elite Special Collector's Edition DVD version is great. The picture has a digitally mastered THX transfer, and the film has never looked this good. The sound is in mono. There are 31 chapters. On the extras front we have two separate commentaries. The first one includes director George A. Romero, along with co-screenwriter John Russo, producer Karl Hardman, who also plays Cooper, and Marilyn Eastman, who plays Cooper's wife. The second commentary features Judith O'Dea, who plays Barbra, producer Russell Streiner, and cast members Bill Hinzman, Kyra Schon, Vince Survinski and Keith Wayne. Both commentaries are excellent. There's a short film entitled Night of the Living Bread. This runs for eight minutes, and it's an absurd and amusing spoof of the feature, with the difference being the people are attacked by slices of bread. There's also some trailers and TV ads. The ads don't have anything to do with the film apart from them being released at the same time as the film in the late sixties.

474273,2,6302484367,"someone who reads this review and is a fan of the original NOTLD and its sequels ""dawn of the dead"" and ""day of the dead"", is probably wondering if i was crazy when giving this film only a 2 star rating. i'd agree that i would be crazy for giving the original 1968 version of this film only a 2 star rating, but i am not rating the original version, i'm critiquing the special 30th anniversary re-issue of the film.
if you have been fortunate enough not to see this version, you're probably wondering what the big difference between the original and this one is. and believe me there is a BIG difference.
if you're reading this, i'm just going to assume that you've seen the original version of the film so i don't have to give a big long summary.  if you've never seen NOTLD and have no clue as to what i'm talking about in this review, i apologize.  please don't let it stop you from seeing the original version of this cinematic masterpiece.
anyway, to those who have been long term fans of the series let me say this: the 30th anniversary ed. of NOTLD, i found out, is a huge disappointment.
#1 yes, this version contains about 15 minutes of brand new footage that is supposed to make the film better. however, the running time has not changed to an hour and 45 minutes.  on the contrary, it still clocks in at roughly 90 minutes. how is this possible you might wonder?  simple, the producers decided to take out 15 minutes of original classic footage and throw in 15 minutes of brand new footage (most of which is annoying and pointless). the only segment of new footage that i found to be enlightening comes at the beginning of the film and explains how the ""cemetery zombie"" came to just be wondering around the graveyard, something the original version never explained.
however, the rest of the added footage is just more scenes of zombies wondering through the night (as if the film needed anymore of that), and a cheesy new ending depicting a scene in which a reporter is interviewing a priest who supposedly survived being bitten by a zombie (any fan of the series knows that no one ever actually survives after being bitten by a zombie). the new ending is pointless and laughable, completely destroying the feeling of uneasiness created by the original version's shocking conclusion.
#2 portions of the music heard in this anniv. ed. have been changed, too.  again, portions of the original film have been taken out to make room for new material.  as a fan of the original version i think nothing should have been changed for this re-release, especially the music. the music for the original version (although not specifically written for the film) worked well because it only helped to add to the tension and suspense of the film by sounding old and dated.
the new portions of music written specifically for this re-release sound anything but old and dated.  i wish that they would've just left everything alone just as it was, but if they were going to replace any of the music at all, i wish they would have re-done the whole score. instead, they left some of the original music in and threw new music in around it apparently hoping that it sound as though it had always been like that.  on the contrary, any fan of the original film will immediately be able to tell where the old music ends and the new begins, probably as well as anyone who hasn't seen the original version. the two different scores just don't mix well.
those are basically all the problems with this version of romero's classic film.  by the way, romero doesn't deserve any blame for this anniv. ed. because he was not involved in any way with its production.  according to the video's liner notes, there were disagreements between members of the production crew during the filming of the original movie back in '68, and since romero was the chosen director his vision of the film was the one that ended up being realized.  this new ed. was produced by the members of the crew who disagreed with romero's finished product, and supposedly inserted the new footage in order to present the story as it was originally meant to be told.
whatever.
from one hard core fan of the series to the rest: skip the 30th anniversary edition of NOTLD. you'd be much better off just watching a marathon of the original 3 films. even the '90 remake of NOTLD looks good compared this piece of garbage (and that's not saying much).",983664000,4,4396,4.573062261753495

Pretend you have never seen a film like this ever before.  A film that dares to show you some truly shocking scenes of gore and cannibalism.  A film which portrays a world gone mad, where the dead rise from the grave, where a women is so scared she wanders around in a state of shock and the person who helps her is a young black man.  It's the late 60's remember.
This film is going to go too far, it's going to show you things you have never been shown before.  It's going to keep the tension going not for just a few minutes but for much of it's running time.  Yeah, some of the acting is really over the top, but give the amateur actors their 15 minutes of fame and realize with the equivalent amount that the recent Blair Witch Project film was made for, George Romero and company made this classic-- which has inspired hundreds of horror films and nearly as many film-makers.  The 30th Anniversary edition gives you a pristine print of the film and an only at times interesting commentary track that features the co-writers and some of the cast but NOT George Romero.

474280,5,6302484367,"When you think of Zombie movies, the first on that comes to mind is of course ""Night of the Living Dead"".  Nobody really identifies with other classics such as ""Plague of the Zombies"" or Fulci's ""Zombie"", and I'll tell you why.  As a Zombie movie fanatic, this appeals to me because of the realism.  Now obviously the dead will never walk, that of course is fiction, but if they did, how would the world react?  The rednecks would have barbeques and shoot outs, the media would go nuts, and if you yourself were in this predicament, what would you do?  This movie explains it best (along with its sequels ""Dawn/Day of the Dead"").  I was uncertain about the new footage though, it seemed out of place, the Reverend was a little too much, they should have left him out, the rest was great though.  I only think they should have shot the new footage with the same grain and grit as the old one.  It doesn't seem right to go from clean and shine to grain and grit, then back and forth and so on.  They should have just remastered the score, added the new zombie scenes, and left it at that, the epilogue should have stayed out of the film.  Also, it seemed like they dragged out the whole ""Beakman's Diner"" incident too long.  I mean, first you hear the black guy explain it, then you hear it on the radio, TWICE, then you see the beakman's diner zombies, and then they added those two gravediggers who talk about it.

The dead are now out to get the flesh of the living! Seven people are stranded in a farmhouse in rural Pennslyvania. They are surrounded by the living dead. They must try to survive. Their struggle to survive through the night is the night of the living dead, a horror classic.
  The original version of the film was low budget with poor picture and sound. This DVD is of far better quality than the original. The picture quality is improved as is the sound. Scenes were added to this cut that would have been ok to keep in the original. Other features were added that are great too. All in all, this special version of a classic only serves to make it better.

Why on earth  did they take a decision to reuse the graveyard zombie as a ""feature  zombie"" - the bloke who plays him is now 30 years older and believe me  you *can* tell the difference! Why is the lip sync on the 30th Anniversary  Edition (in particular the new sequences) more poorly dubbed than a  Japanese Godzilla flick?  This film *was* made in English wasn't it? Why  did they add an Epilogue?  The bald bloke ain't no Anthony Perkins from the  end of Psycho and his dialogue adds nothing to the Living Dead trilogy. Why  didn't they add an additional soundtrack to the ""98 version""  which contained the original musical score?  Isn't that the sort of thing  that DVD was invented for? and my final question: WHY did I waste my money  on this?

474447,2,6302484367,"One day when I was about 13, I bought a old VHS of Night of the Living Dead at Wal-Mart for $5.  I had no idea what I was buying and no idea what kind of horror I was about to witness.  I made the mistake of watching the  movie by myself in a dark room that night.  Halfway through the movie I had  the light on and was peering out the window and looking at the door to the  TV room.  This movie scared the heck out of me.  Anything to do with  Zombies would forever scare me especially when I watched the other movies  by Romero and played the Resident Evil Games on Playstation.  That was then  and now I am 27.  I still have the VHS copy of Night of the Living Dead.  I will never get rid of it because that movie still scares me to this day.  Then I am looking thru the DVD movies and I come across this movie.  Night  of the Living Dead - 30th Anniversary Edition.  My first thoughts were,  Awsome!  I then sat and watched all the aspects of this DVD.  I cannot  believe they tried to milk this movie again and all they accomplished was  defiling this great horror classic.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was  because the new score music was pretty cool, but did not belong in this  movie.  What they should have really done was code this movie to DVD  without altering it at all.  The new re-edited, re-scored, extras scene  added version of this horror classic is a horror to watch.  The new added  scenes actually had me laughing at the bad acting.  I know many of you are  saying, bah!  What do you know!  Let me explain.
1.  The added scenes  where completly horrible and full of bad acting.  Yes the scenes were added  seamlessly because they remastered the movie.  The preacher was a horrible  Billy Zane wannabe and the zombies in the new footage could not even walk  like a zombie.  Another scene had a car crash where the driver hit the  winshield and lost his brain, and the wife in the passenger seat and two  daughters in the back of the car have no injuries and seemed to have  remained in their seats and not sprawled all over the car after a head on  collision with a tree.  They were not even wearing seatbelts!  Many of the  Zombies just walked normally, how horrible!  And they spent money to add  this footage?  Total rip-off! 2.  The added score is completely awful.  This is a old movie and needed the old sounding music from the orginal.  They try to add the new score everywhere in this movie!  Someplaces in the  movie need to have no music!  This sets the mood and has the audience on  edge.  The orginal score, what they called ""library music"", was  better than the junk they added. 3.  The totally ripped and hacked the  movie cuting out dead scenes that took up space.  This space is needed to  again keep the audience on edge and have them thinking what will happen  next.  So what do you get?  I hacked and cut movie where some parts are cut  to add the 15 minutes of new footage.  A total waste. 4.  All the extras  are just a waste of time to watch.  If you have to have this DVD to add  to your collection, don't say I warned you.  It is horrible, horrible,  horrible.  You are better off finding the movie un-edited.  Yes the  re-mastering cleared it up, but the blurryness of the orginal added to the  horror of the movie.  On a final note, if it aint broke, DON'T FIX IT!",957916800,3,3317,4.192616372391654

The title is somewhat self explanatory, The  Living Dead are rising from the grave to consume human flesh (brains that  is).  The opening scene is a flawless example of a film maker deftly  tricking the audience into believing that everything is ok, and then WHAM!  a quiet country cemetery turns into a zombie factory.  George Romero's use  of an African-American protagonist seems truly groundbreaking for its time,  and what a performance Duane Jones gives as the reluctant organizer of a  stranded band of ""living"" survivors stuck in a farm house.  At  first you think ""why don't they run?"" but the realization that  the living will eventually tire and that the dead keep coming brings the  hope of escape to a screeching halt.  The understanding that the odds of  these people making it out alive are nothing short of impossible will have  you whispering ""Oh No"" to yourself again and again as you watch  this movie.

474509,1,6302484367,"Boy, this is a tough one. The original ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a landmark genre milestone, deserving buckets of praise. Despite pitiful actors, crude make-up effects and a budget from hell,  George A. Romero really struck a nerve in 1968. He created a classic that  still to this day stands out as one of the best. A classic in no need of  any additional scenes...
Therefore, I cannot for the life of me explain  how much I HATE this new version of the film. The 15 minutes of new footage  brings absolutely nothing to the story. Only confusion and irritation.  There is a new religious angle (given to us by the most hysterical and  hideously overacted priest in cinematic history), that completely ruins the  quiet mood of the original. Some extra gore-scenes and shots of more modern  looking ghouls have been added, replacing several well known zombie shots  from the 60's version.
The soundtrack has been completely replaced by  modern synthesized music, a move that finally puts the lid on the original  movie, turning it into a modern day techno extravaganza with the 60's  atmosphere of a Marilyn Manson concert. The most tremendously clumsy and  idiotic fault is that the sound is out of sync with the action in many  scenes, which really makes you wonder who in God's name approved the final  print. The only good thing I can say about this new edition is that the  picture quality has never been better. Super sharp and crystal clear, the  best transfer ever.
I really suffer with Mr. Romero... His first  masterpiece has been bashed by critics, truncated by censors and marketed  by greedy people who ripped him off financially. It has been remade and  restored with terrible results and he will forever be associated with every  worthless new experiment, churned out by dollar hungry amateurs determined  to bank in on his name.
I sincerely hope he had nothing to do with this  release. Romero is a quality-buff, adamant about the perfection of his  work. He is hardly mentioned in the narration, and I'm pretty sure he's  happy about it. Because no matter what happens, George A. Romero will  always be the one and only inimitable master of the living dead.
No one  can ever take that away from him...",949449600,5,2221,4.7434554973821985
474510,5,6302484367,"After watching movies year after year after year, we have specfic pictures that have changed the very way we had previously looked at something either in life, philosophy, or etc. Gone with the Wind and the Wizard of Oz made  1939 audiences see the unbelievable potential of color films, Orson Welles  amazed critics and audiences alike with his masterful grasp of film concept  in Citizen Kane, John Ford showed that the Western could show emotional  depth and sophistication in the Searchers, and Alfred Hitchcock horrified  audiences by proving that anything can happen in the movies even the death  of a main character fifty minutes into the movie. With 1969's highly  influential Night of the Living Dead, George A. Romero presented to  audiences a frightingly plausiable possibility. The villains in Romero's  piece were not monsters from outerspace, 50 feet tall women, radioactive  lizards attacking Tokyo, or some cheap special effect plastered  unconvincingly on a film's background. They were human. The film's plot  talking about space radiation from a Venus Probe cauing the Dead to rise  can seem rather silly. Besides the facts of the scientific and the campy,  humans were attacking and eating humans. The enemy was not some bizarre  tangent of someone's imagination. They were human. The possibility and  likelihood that these events could conceivably happen in real life may be  ""Night's"" greatest and most obvious contribution to the horror  film. Like Hitchcock's Psycho, the threat was something real that could  perhaps happen or may have already happened. These films deal with  repressed psychological fears that resulted from abnormal pshychology, the  cold war and anxiety over possible nuclear armageddon. Romero and his  collaborators bickered fiercly over artistic control in this film, and it  shows prominently through the film. Especially in the relationships between  Ben and Mr. Cooper in the film's final half. The film's brillant  denoucement of how humans self-destruct through mis-communication is very  celebral and moving in it's simplicity and gut-wrenching execution. For a  horror film, these philosohical attributes make Night of the Living Dead an  emotional powerhouse that still thrills audiences to this day. The  ambiguous final five minutes of Night of the Living Dead brings more  questions about human morality than most modern fiction. All this in a  ninety-six minute movie made on very low budget. Generally low budgets  hamper movies significantly, in the case of George Romero's Night of the  Dead, the graniness of the film's picture and the simplicity of Night's set  make the anxiety and fear that much more close. A brillant milestone in  modern horror movies. A must-see. See Romero's 96 minute orginal over  Russo' overbearing 30th anniversary addition that everyone is complaining  about.",949276800,,2852,5.3854875283446715

I wasn't even able  to tell the difference between the ""New"" Zombie footage and the  old footage.

The interactive  ""trivia"" questions, what few there are, are too easy and focus on  just the plot, never challenging horror fans with behind-the-scenes and  production-related questions (this would have been far more interesting).  It also appears to me that the production team behind the NOTLD DVD didn't  put much effort into this transfer. The credit list lacks detail, and the  only biography they have is on Duane Jones (Ben). What happened to George  A. Romero?
Also, the quality of the film itself is unsatisfactory, fuzzy  at best. Maybe it's because my TV doesn't have that blasted S-Video  configuration (but I doubt it, as other DVDs in my collection are visually  stunning despite the lack of ""S-Video""), but this print of NOTLD  did nothing to progress the quality that DVDs are suppost to bring to old  classics.

474514,3,6302484367,"This is probably one of the best horror movies ever made and an undoubted classic. I just don't understand how anybody could ever come up with the idea to add some 15 minutes of new scenes shot in 1999 to this 1969  masterpiece. What would you think if they did that to say Casablanca? These  new scenes do not add anything original or new insights. On the contrary,  they distract, ridicule the movie (probably unintentionally) and thus make  a perfect movie lesser so. Since the original version is also on this disc  I strongly recommend to watch the original, specifically to those seeing it  for the first time. You will then see the movie as it was intended by its  creators visually. You won't hear the original music, though. It has been  replaced by a new music score, recently composed. Don't ask me why. The  original suspense score fit the movie very well. No need to better it. From  a strict audio point of view the DD 5.1 rendered score sounds better than  the monaural original. But does it fit to the movie? Does it enhance the  dramatic viewing experience? The predominant piano reminded me strongly of  expressionist silent movies and I don't think it's adequate for this film.  BTW: Above rating refers to this edition only. The movie, of course, is  five stars!",945561600,4,1282,4.660714285714286
474555,5,6302484367,"5 stars on a Cult/Midnight movie scale, although I regretably admit that it is perhaps only a 4 on a popular movie scale (though many sources give it 5).  Dark and forboding atmosphere.  Definitely of its time.  Unfortunantly, a movie like this would unlikely be produced today, for it  doesn't rely on huge celebrities and/or crazy fantastical special effects,  excessively included to meat-up a weak plot and a poor script.  Very much a  suspensful drama.  Mood and atmosphere are key in this film.  The lighting  helps create this feel, so stick with the Black & White version, stay  away from the colorized versions, in which the faulty colors ruin  everything.  The very low budget alotted for the production of this classic  really adds its overall appeal, that is if you haven't already been  conditioned by today's movies to not recognize true art and creativity.  Fans of George Romero (director & co-writer)should also check out  Martin, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead.  Return of the Living Dead  (written by Night of the Living Dead co-writer, John Russo) is also a must  see. This 1968 version of Night of the Living Dead should be included in  every ghoul's movie collection and viewed at least once a year on  Halloween, much in the like tradition of It's a Wonderful Life being viewed  on Christmas.  This movie doesn't contain very much gore (just enough), any  nudity (it's not about that) and very little profanity (I think  ""Dammit"" is used).  The story and dialogue are great.  A real  eerie and captivating movie if watched in the dark late at night, and it's  a steal for the low prices they charge for this movie.  The soundtrack also  adds to the overall creepy texture.  So what are you waiting for? Order  your copy today!  Get one for a friend!  You will thank me for the rest of  your life...as well as in the afterlife!  Other recommendations: Evil Dead,  Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness, Carnival of Souls (1963?/B&W), Plan 9  From Outer Space.

And speaking of rhythms: the new musical score by Scott Vladimir Licina  does have a certain eerie, languid beauty; but it's all wrong for this  film, and often--as, for example, in the early cemetary sequence--works at  cross-purposes with the images it's supposed to be enhancing.
