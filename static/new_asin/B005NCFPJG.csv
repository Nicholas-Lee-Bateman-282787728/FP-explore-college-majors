Dick has a way of taking you to the heart of the matter in whatever area of instruction he is giving and that certainly was true with these videos.  His insights and comments make you really think...deeply.
I am looking forward to using these videos in our annual pastoral staff retreat as material to help us improve.  As another contributor said, we may end up only looking at just a few videos or maybe even only one.
Great job Dick and thank you for your heart for churches and pastors!",1321574400,,605,4.383928571428571
4846128,5,B005NCFPJG,"Dear Pastor/leader,

I cannot express enough to you the value of this material.  We purchased the entire series for our staff in Mid August at the teaser price.  What interested me was the true coaching approach that is part of each package.  My plan was to use it as enrichment on our annual planning work-away the following month.  I believed that we could plow through them while we were away.  WOW! was I wrong on that one.  The material is so relevant, so thought provoking that we only got through one of them, but was it a wonderful ride.  Discussion was deep due to the excellent coaching questions asked.  Certainly one of the greatest aspects was the application/action questions that served to put calendared legs on the discussion.  The team could see it before them.  We are not just fleshing this out as a church, but each ministry is doing it as well.

I must say that if the other packages in the series are anything like this package [and they are I have looked ahead] we have a years work of priceless, relevant discussion and action ahead.  Blend that with asserted prayer that binds it all together and keeps it on course, and you have a winning combination!

No matter the size of your church, you will find this material excellent for your teams.  Additionally, I serve as the Presbyter for the N.E. part of our State. I am planning in 2012 to help make this resource available to our pastors by direct training workshops and direct purchases.  Dick and team are also working on other levels via the internet to assist our Sectional pastors beyond the materials.

The Hardy Group has hit a home run here.  Pastor/leader could not ask for a more genuinely caring, interested and experienced team to work with your team.

From one leader to another,

Make the investment!

4846129,5,B005NCFPJG,"The Hardy Group provides an excellent resource through six concise but informing DVDs.  Dick Hardy walks us through six topics encompassing obstacles that may be hindering our church growth and methods to overcome these obstacles.  Each 10-minute is accompanied by a tremendous workbook recapping the DVD discussion and providing a base to generate discussion among church staffs.  Through the DVDs, Dick discusses three things missing in flat and declining churches, five pastor-driven obstacles to church growth, three cultures necessary for a church to grow, three foundational elements for a church to grow, nine aspects of over-the-top guest hospitality, and twelve steps to the culture of improvement in the church.

The 10-minute length of each video is perfect for a staff environment.  While each video opens with a fun application to life, they will conclude with a challenging thought regarding the growth of your church.  In no way did the DVDs beat up the pastor or condemn churches for not doing enough; rather, in a loving manner that encourages the church to return to the call of prayer and execute these practical steps, a deeper passion to save the lost is sparked.  There may be obstacles that stand in the way, but if we pray and take action, we can make it happen.",1321228800,,1286,5.037735849056604
