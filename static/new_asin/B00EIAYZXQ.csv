5915290,5,B00EIAYZXQ,Classic zombie movie..!!! A Must have..!!!,1451779200,,42,6.166666666666667
5915291,5,B00EIAYZXQ,"At the time of this writing, the Anchor Bay Blu-Ray disc is going for $30 minimum, and the video on that has some nasty Digital Noise Reduction and dirt removal that removes a lot of the detail, while this on the other hand has the video of the Arrow Disc (also out of print), which is superior to the Anchor Bay disc, and even better than the Japanese 3-disc set (which had major issues with incorrect color and contrast). Region Free, so it'll play in any player, but the ""Dead Will Walk"" documentary is in 50hz so it won't play in most American players.
Simply put, this is the best version of the Theatrical Cut on home video, and at $12, there's no reason to not get this if you're a fan.",1451347200,4,693,4.257575757575758
5915292,3,B00EIAYZXQ,"This is supposed to be in Blu-ray, yet on the package it only says high definition. It does not appear as sharp as my other Blu-ray movies are. If I'd known it was not truly Blu-ray I would have and should have found it for less money.",1451347200,,235,4.0212765957446805
5915293,2,B00EIAYZXQ,I realize after watching this movie as an adult their are a lot of characters that yell constantly. After watching the walking dead for a few seasons now this movie is not good and shows its age with the bad/over acting.,1447977600,,220,4.390243902439025
5915294,5,B00EIAYZXQ,"Works perfect! Took a bit of time to get, but well worth it",1445990400,2,59,3.6153846153846154
5915295,5,B00EIAYZXQ,"This is the only way film fans/collectors can get a HD blu ray version of
Romero's Dawn of the Dead for a steal in terms of pricing

It's a Import but, it's region free and less then $20.00 it also has lots of great extras
Has the black cover art from the Ultimate Collection  A+

If you missed the out of print (Anchorbay/Starz  or Arrow home video blu ray's) This is the only real way to go without taking out a loan for a blu ray  ($150.00+ for a out of print single disc is insane)

Snag it asap before it to disappears",1445731200,,523,4.029126213592233

8605634,5,B00EIAYZXQ,The description is false. You do not need a Region Free Blu-ray player. The disc is Region Free. Of course the quality is great...,1510963200,2,130,4.458333333333333
8605635,5,B00EIAYZXQ,The DVD case had the title in English but all other writing was Chinese.  I was a bit alarmed. The movie is fine.  Looks better than I remember.  Loved sharing it with a few friends that hadn't seen it.,1495238400,,202,4.128205128205129
8605636,5,B00EIAYZXQ,"Though I prefer the 1968 Night of the Living Dead as my favorite horror movie, the independently made Dawn of the Dead is the quintessential zombie epic and remains so, after nearly forty years and countless other zombie movies and TV series being made.

As a ten years-later sequel to Night, it expands that micro-budget film's territory to the whole world and a vision of apocalypse, seen through the eyes of two SWAT team members, a chopper pilot and the pilot's pregnant girlfriend, all of them holed up in an abandoned Pennsylvania shopping mall.

Its action is now criticized by some as low budget-looking and its blood and grue as not impressive enough. These people perhaps forget that in those days the special effects were hands-on and not computerized, thus by far more impressive than most of what is done today.

They also fail to appreciate a lower-budget filmmaker's creation of a massive horror epic and commentary on consumerism out of limited money. The horror epic stands unmatched to this day, and the commentary on consumerism still resounds in our current time.

The film is also the original template of every regularly seen zombie trope in modern film. From the way that they walk to their look to their forms of violence (but concentrate here on the zombies that are particularly designed, since many in the crowds have a simple low-budget ""blue-faced"" appearance!).

It all started here, and remains much the same on shows like Walking Dead. Attempts by non-Romero types to make zombies fast-moving or of a much higher intelligence have fizzled out, and Romero's mythology remains strong in the cultural consciousness even if some young horror fans are not yet fully aware of this!

It all started here with this film and with Night before it and Day after it, so for God's sake have at them if you've never seen them before!

This film's far inferior 2004 ""remake,"" complete with fast-moving zombies, is best seen as a wholly different and unrelated ""tribute"" to Romero - that is, if it must be seen at all!",1483228800,,2034,4.844380403458214
8605637,5,B00EIAYZXQ,"Come on guys. Before walking dead, the strain, I am legend, evil dead etc, we have this gem. This is more of a comedy to me now. Do yourself a favor and snatch one of these up.",1480204800,2,176,3.7837837837837838
8605638,5,B00EIAYZXQ,"Not letterbox, but a good crisp copy with a few scenes not in the theatrical cut. Enjoyed by my whole family twice in a month.",1477267200,,126,4.08
