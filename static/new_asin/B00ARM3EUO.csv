8556917,5,B00ARM3EUO,"I blame not captain schwieger for sinking the Lusitania. Is it schweiger or schwieger? Anybody know?  .....  my money says german spies already knew of weapons on board the ship which makes it a warship regardless of who is aboard. there are no "" rules of war"" by the way.  ..

8556918,5,B00ARM3EUO,"I initially saw this documentary on the History Channel and took notes to share with my students. It's a great updated look at a tragic piece of history. The video contains eyewitness reports, information from Captain Turner, a close-up look at the remaining cargo, and the damage caused by the torpedos.  The current owner, who believes the theory that the ship was carrying illegal cargo, tries to further investigate what caused the second blast which sunk the ship. Through technology, they are able to test several of the theories and come up with a tentative explanation. It's a wonderful tool to use when teaching about the beginning of WWI and the US's involvement, or for a history buff who loves a good mystery.",1380067200,4,721,4.861788617886178
8556919,2,B00ARM3EUO,"I am disapointed. This documentary was sold by reviews like a new investigation which solved the mistery of the sinking of the Lusitania.
A the end, nothing at all. But is there a mistery after all? All the answers are in the investigation after the sinking, and in the books written in the 50's and the 60's.

This new documentary only deals with commons and usuals suppositions about the sinking. The only good point is the testimonials of survivors, the other, it is mostly videos taken on the explorer ship, dealing with problems like weather and time remaining.

I suggest the old National Geographic documentary released in the 90's, which was a true one, with respect for the ship and the victims.

If you want the true answers, read theses old books:
