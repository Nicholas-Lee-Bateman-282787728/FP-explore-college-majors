7801236,4,1927431115,"This DVD collects the first season of the Canadian produced web series which follows a superhero group known as Heroes of the North.  The superhero team consists of The Canadian (powers: super-strength and stamina, electrostatic shield), Fleur-de-Lys (powers: electricity generating gauntlets), 8 Ball (powers: skilled martial artist, 8 ball grenades and other weapons) , Nordik (powers: bracelets with paralyzing neurotoxin, immunity to cold), and The Black Terror (powers: nanotechnologically enhanced strength).  They are recruited together by Major Pearson who needs them to help with mounting threats against Canada (and the world) such as the sinister Madame Doom, the criminal organization Medusa, and the pro-Quebec terrorist organization the New FLQ.

There's actually a heck of a good concept within this web series with a rich universe of characters and interesting enough inter-twining storylines.  Just know going in that it's a pretty cheesy affair with production values that fall below the level of a poor B-Movie and very much fit the perception that many people have of web series as cheap and amateurish.  Basically, think of what you would get if you rounded up a group of cosplayers from your local comic con and tried to put together your own superhero TV series.  But then the entire crew approaches the whole thing with such conviction, that more often than not the series rises above its limitations.  And to me, classifying something as a cheap B-Movie doesn't necessarily mean it's bad.  I can enjoy cheesy if it's got heart.  (Hey, I was a big fan of classic Doctor Who and it doesn't get much cheesier than that!)  And Heroes of the North definitely has an addicting quality about it and it just seemed to click with me.  Maybe it was the eye candy of the female characters (they've recruited some seriously hot actresses and clad them in some rather complementary skin-tight duds).  Maybe it just seemed like there was more here beneath the surface than what their budget could adequately portray.  Or maybe it's because I've always had an inexplicable draw to Canadian superheroes since the days of the Captain Canuck comic book (and I loved the original Alpha Flight as well).  But I can definitely say that I liked it.

The series borrows heavily from many of the expected superhero tropes, but it does it well enough that it doesn't just feel like a complete rip off of what has come before it.  And one of the things I like the most about it is that these aren't namby-pamby superheroes whose motto is that they won't kill no matter what.  Nope, they acknowledge that the bad guys are a pretty dangerous lot and there's bullets flying and heads a'cracking left and right and plenty of people biting the dust.  Not that it's some sort of far right wing let's-just-kill-all-the-criminals tale, the series just doesn't pull any punches (and definitely doesn't fit the stereotype we have of Canadians as a liberal, peace-loving lot).  I also really liked the retro episodes where we see the exploits of the Canadian Shield back in WWII.  That, in my opinion, could work as its own stand-alone series.

They have the makings of a potential franchise with Heroes of the North, and I believe that it has developed a bit of a following in its home country.  It would be really nice to see this one catch on so that they could get some more funding and improve the production values.  And they have produced several  comic book continuations, which are actually quite first-rate and add to the overall story.  Both are definitely worth checking out, just understand that the web series is a rather cheesy affair and somewhat rough around the edges.
