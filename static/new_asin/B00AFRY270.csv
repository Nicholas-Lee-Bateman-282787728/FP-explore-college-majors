8551131,3,B00AFRY270,"A good detective story with lots of action that shows the influences of Hollywood, but has at least one twists to many--at the end where credibility is stretched a bit too far.
Set in the China of the early 1930s, the action stems from murders at an arms factory complicated by superstitions and politics. A young hot shot detective is joined by an older outsider whose skills will remind you of Sherlock Homes and a woman medical examiner who seems a precursors to a C.S. I. show.
The lead actors are very good, much better then the director who has trouble keeping the story line focused. Still a good entertainment.",1414108800,,618,4.627272727272727
8551132,5,B00AFRY270,"Set in the ""Warlord Era"" of 1930s China, this tale of locked room murder and rampant corruption, police and otherwise, anticipates the first season ending TV's Elementary by two years. It's fascinating, stylish and surprisingly heartwrenching.",1382227200,,243,5.777777777777778
