8659102,5,B00KHXOEWA,"If you have a DVD player that can play all regions, this is the ""Mrs. Brown"" set to buy.  Contains the three regular seasons of the show, plus the special Christmas episodes.  I don't know why I love this show (it can be so base), but it makes me laugh.  Wish there were more!",1491350400,,276,4.074074074074074

8659106,5,B00KHXOEWA,"If you're looking for more laughs than you can imagine - this set is for you! It arrived as expected and in great shape, and was more than worth the price - even though we had to purchase a Region Free DVD player to watch it (which we knew in advance).The language and many aspects of the plots are definitely intended for adults - this is definitely not a family series. If you don't mind the ""blue"" language, though, you'll laugh until your sides hurt!",1429315200,,454,4.352941176470588

8659110,5,B00KHXOEWA,"I love this show. I am so sorry that Brendan O'Carrol (Mrs. Brown) didn't want to do a fourth season. They may do a spinoff called Wash and Dry which will be a the son's beauty parlor. Brendan will play a man (the manager of the salon). There were so many one liners that I share on facebook. I laughted so hard. It is also a shame that this is only for Region 2. My computer gets Region 2 so I did get to watch it there. Brendan was also asked to come to American, but he didn't think it would be good for his family. The cast of the show are predomently his family members. Example of a good line: the cutest message for your answering machine.
""Hello this is Mrs Brown. I'm not taking this call because I'm trying to avoid talking to someone. If I don't call you back, it was you.""",1410566400,2,784,4.064516129032258
