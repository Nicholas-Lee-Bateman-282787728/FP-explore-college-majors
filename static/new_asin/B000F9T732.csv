2556561,4,B000F9T732,"Not only my son loves to watch the 4 movies comes with this DVD, My wife and I enjoyed watching too. Jackes has always been the kind of animated series not only enjoyable to kids but also to adults.

The reason I gave it 4 stars is that every story seems just a little too short for me.",1182816000,,286,3.9310344827586206

2556564,5,B000F9T732,I am so glad that Jakers has come to DVD.  I actually miss watching this during the day because of work.  I can honestly and proudly say that I have been known to watch this program on PBS even when my children aren't around because I enjoy it and the sheep crack me up every episode!  This is definitely a movie adults won't mind watching with their children.  Sunday movie night just got a boost!,1155513600,8,398,4.266666666666667
2556565,5,B000F9T732,"I was so happy to see that some episodes of Jakers has been released to dvd. We used to watch it with our daughter on the local pbs station in nyc but then we moved from the area and found that our new city's local pbs station didn't show it. This is actually the one kid's show that both my husband and I don't mind watching with our daughter. Jakers follows the adventures of Piggly Winks and his pals while growing up in Ireland. They get into plenty of mischief but there is always a lesson to be learned and the values of families and friendship are strongly reinforced. Whether you're already aquainted with Jakers or are new to it, this is a great dvd.",1153872000,5,659,4.28
2556566,5,B000F9T732,"I am so excited to see that ""Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks"" is available on DVD. It is the only series that I allow my 16 month old watch and he loves it. Each episode begins with Grandpa Winks telling his grandchildren a story of growing up with his friends in Ireland and then the episode shows Grandpa's adventures as a youngster, ""Piggley Winks"". Each story has a lesson and the series shows the importance of family and friends. Also, you know it's got to be good if Mel Brooks is involved (he supplies the voice of Wiley the sheep).",1152316800,9,548,4.435643564356436

8119542,5,B000F9T732,"Makers the Adventures of Pigley Winks is an adorable cartoon that follows 3 friends in rural Ireland.  The stories are retold by Pigley to his grandchildren.  Pigley, Dannon (the duck) and Ferny (the bull) are always getting in to some innocent mischief.  Cute and wholesome.  Enjoyable for the parents as well as the kids.",1375574400,,323,4.925925925925926
8119543,5,B000F9T732,WE NEED MORE OF THIS TYPE OF ETHICAL ENTERTAINTMENT FOR YOUNGSTERS BUT WHY SO EXPENSIVE.  EVEN COMPARED WITH ALTERNATIVE ANIMATION DVDs FOR KIDS STILL A HIGH COST FOR SUCH A SHORT RUNNING TIME?,1368835200,,193,4.848484848484849
8119544,5,B000F9T732,"Our whole family absolutely loves this show (ages 2 and up!)...cute, funny, and teaching valuable lessons. I am only sorry I did not know about it until now and missed out on the opportunity to get the whole collection with every episode. From what I can gather, they made 13 videos worth with 4 episodes on every DVD. We have collected four with another one I can see available, but the rest don't seem to ever be available in North American format or at reasonable prices :( I even went so far as to try to contact the production company (twice now) to try to find out more information or see if I can get copies of the rest, but they have not responded. Really wish PBS would bring this show back. If you happen to know where I can get any more videos in North American DVD format, please comment/contact me!",1367107200,2,811,4.342105263157895
8119545,5,B000F9T732,"My grandchildren and I always enjoy Jackers.  Piggly tries to teach life lessons to his two grandsons, Shamus and Jamey, using stories from his own childhood.  It is always interesting and funny and we also learn something from it.  No bad language, either.",1294012800,,257,4.930232558139535
8119546,5,B000F9T732,"I don't understand why but my daughter just loves it. We own all the 5 DVDs so far on the market and almost every book also.

At very beginning, I bought a ready-to-read book (level-1) of this serious accidentally: ""Piggly makes the pie"", which episode is including in the DVD. Although she was just several months over one years old and hardly could understand most of words ( we talked to her in Chinese most of the time ), it soon became her favorite book. The book is very good. It has little picture icons to help the little kids in reading, e.g.: apple, window , goat, etc. all shown by both words and pictures in the line. So, I thought it would be more helpful to get the DVD. After all, she just loves the whole serious.

PBS also has a ""Jakers"" stories website for little kids. There are 4 stories, reading by grandpa ""Piggley"". Now it has been our bed-time stories club every night. If you like, you can go and try it first.

Now we read the book, watch the DVDs and go the PBS.com to meet our grandpa Piggley every day!",1219190400,,1031,4.276923076923077
8119547,5,B000F9T732,"These are really fun stories that teach life lessons.  I wish every child had an opportunity to watch them.  They would be even be good for adults to watch with their children.  The humor is great at all levels.  Mel Brooks plays Wiley, the sheep.",1218844800,,247,4.4222222222222225
