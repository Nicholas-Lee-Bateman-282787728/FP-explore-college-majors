8746866,5,B01AALE19E,"This contains 2 MUST-SEE movies with Renee Harmon involvement, and if you are scratching your dome with an artifact asking yourself ""Renee who?"", so was I until spending a few hours with this disc spinning it's renderful web of whatheheckisthis.

Ms. Harmon produced both of these films and also appeared in them (I think she may have even written our been involved in the screenplay activities of ""The Executioner Part 2""), but all that really matters is that if you need confoundment that leads to preposterous disillusion and therefore enlightenment (it's a journey that not many can take but hold on to your potato chips with one hand and be brave as you launch into the inner stratosphere), this is your one-way ticket to the land of never-come-back.

Sure, ""The Executioner Part 2"" was just a ploy to rope in those who had just seen ""The Exterminator"" and, froth still glistening on their theatre-tanned lips, were hoping for another dose of Robert Ginty in full-blown vigilante mode (maybe predisposing those evil forces that combined were perhaps even then plotting to unsoil 42nd Street into a family-friendly political grandstand). Does that matter? Not when the pseudo-follow-up is this capable of rendering our thought-patterns to mimic animal tranquilizer and tonic!

I'm still not certain if ""Frozen Scream"" is even better, but it does feature some downright scary happenings amongst the brain-creasing shenanigans that troubling-movie fans demand (if not always expect).

In short, if you want a serious study in uh, anything, go hobnob with a Hobbit. If these 2 bewildering films could be shown in a perpetual loop...my, my. Barriers could be eliminated that would transform the seething greed of this planet into a strange but true habitat, perhaps even for the elusive Sasquatch and their TV-watching friends (like you and me).",1525824000,,1845,5.14

8746868,2,B01AALE19E,"I only watched ""The Executioner Part 2"". I can't recommend it, but it is not a 1-star movie either. Not much to say, it's pretty terrible.

Ok, couple of b--ches leave 'not helpfuls' but not replies, so I'll add to this. 1. They don't even try with the special effects. He's supposed to be blowing people up with grenades and it cuts to this gasoline fire type weird screen filling thing. Stupid. 2. The actors, aside from the cop dad, have zero ZERO chops.. no talent. 3. The story is very poorly cobbled together. The main bad dude is not believable as a bad dude.. this movie is below B.

But one more time, it is not a 1 star. It has some semblance of a story, characters and redeemable plot.",1480377600,,696,4.305343511450381
