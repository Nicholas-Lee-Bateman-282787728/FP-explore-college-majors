Buy these videos to grow interest in Judo. O-Sensei(Great teacher) Nishioka's intent of this video series was to introduce Judo, get people interested in the sport, remove some barriers but not to teach it. He clearly states that learning Judo requires an instructor. Karate and weapons (which Nishioka is a black belts in both) are very popular and seen in movies & television frequently. The video attempts to show that Judo can be just as fun, interesting & powerful. These videos attempt to show learning Judo is easy, kids take to it like a duck to water. The Japanese ceremonys are nothing to fear and shouldn't get in the way from learning Judo. The Japanese language used should not be a barrier in learning Judo. Kids can learn Judo, tiny bit of Japanese very easily, make friends and have fun. One can continue in Judo for life and not know everything, Judo can be a life pursuit, it is also complex.

Sensei Nishioka's martial arts classes has changed several tens of thousands for the better. Many students get excited, learn and excell in something for the first time in their lives. Nishioka transformed many to excelled in both Karate & Judo and other facets in life. Mr. Nishoka has achieved many things in martial arts (8 times Grand Champion), movies, business and then went on to earn a doctorate from California State University of Los Angeles. Excelling from martial arts to achieving many life goals is a common effect. At a minimum, martial arts increases their self confidence.

A friend or parent can purchase this video series in the hope of capturing someone's interest, remove fears (fear of the unknown) of the ceremony & language and possibly change the path of their lives for the better. The tapes can be a non threatening way to show them the sport.

THE POWER OF JUDO:
Those learning Karate, Kobudo, Aikido, Kendo, Jujitsu and other martial arts can benefit greatly from Judo. Many of the best martial artists learn more than one martial art. O-Sensei Fumio Demura learned Judo first and then went on to become world renown in Karate. Nishioka won a karate tournament, Nisei week, defeating many black belts while a white belt in karate.",1149292800,,2272,4.7735368956743
7913432,4,B00000JRUX,"Judo, Volume 1 by Hayward Nishioka

In this 3 Volume video series of which this is Volume 1, former United States Judo Champion, Hayward Nishioka narrates introductory level instructional information about Judo.  This video series is about the sport of Judo.  While Judo can also be used in self-defense, this video does not emphasize in any way the self-defense potential of  Judo.

If  you are looking for self-defense applications of Judo, I recommend that you consider buying the book and 5 video series of  Wally Jay's Small Circle Jujitsu instead.

The previous reviewer's comments were extreme, hostile, and somewhat misleading.

While children are shown at the beginning in the video doing exercises and practicing falls as part of the normal routine everybody performs at the beginning of  a judo class, they are not disorganized, not giggling, or carrying on in any manner that is distracting to the idea of  participating in the activity of  Judo.  They are performing the same activities that the adults do in a Judo class.  Some of  them are performing very well.  You might see a child or two and even the adults smile a few times in this video.  It only means that they enjoy the moment or the activity.  It is really only a short segment of the video and not a major one in which the children are shown.  The purpose is obviously to allow parents who might view the video and be wondering whether or not they should allow their child to take up the study and practice of Judo to see other children practicing Judo.  Parents often wonder whether an activity is appropriate for their child or whether their child is ready for a particular activity.  Girls, young ladies, and women sometimes ask themselves whether particular activities are for them as well.  Girls, young ladies and women do practice judo and other martial arts in Japan, in the United States and in other places around the world.  You will see young ladies and women practicing Judo in this video series also.

I do share the complaint with the previous reviewer that this video is not as long as indicated on the outside of the video cover.  The cover says that it is 45 minutes long.

But, Hayward Nishioka concludes the instruction after only 32 and  minutes.  He should have included video coverage of all those throws in his book, ""Foot Throws: Karate, Judo and Self-Defense"" which is a pretty good book on the subject.

As a further criticism, Hayward Nishioka needs to relax and speak normally or animate his voice a little when giving instruction on video.  In some parts of the video, his monotone voice seems to be reading a speech from paper which tends to bore an audience.  If you can overlook these criticisms you might want this video.  After all you can view the videos on days when you don't attend Judo class to help you remember how to execute a throw or how to say some of these Japanese words.  If you can't overlook these criticisms, there are other Judo video series available.  You can find many advertised in martial art magazines.  Look them up, call them and ask them to send you a complete catalog of their books and videos.

The first 14 minutes contains introductory information and warm up exercises such as stretching and calisthenics.  Exercises are done at the beginning of every martial arts school class to get students and participants ready for physical activity.  Without the warm up exercises, participants in any physically strenuous activity are at risk of  receiving an injury do to strained muscles, tendons, ligaments, etc.  Therefore, viewing the exercises serves to remind students and participants to do them.  Furthermore, watching the exercises offers the viewer who is not yet a participant a view of  what he or she can expect to be doing at the start of each class.

The next 8 minutes after the conclusion of the exercises shows students practicing various judo fall procedures.  This is also standard at all judo and aikido schools.  Students must prepare themselves to fall properly at the beginning of  the class to prevent injury when they are thrown to the ground.

The next 10 minutes of  this volume shows a series 10 various beautifully executed judo throws.  All the activities in Judo have Japanese names.  The practitioner or student needs to learn these names to recognize the activity to be done.  The throws demonstrated in this video include:  Osotogari,  Ogoshi,  Morote Seoinage,  Okuri Ashibarai,  Haraigoshi, Ippon Seoinage,  Ouchigari,  Tsurikomigoshi,  Taiotoshi,  Kouchigari.

7913433,2,B00000JRUX,"Hayward Nishioka is well known in the Judo world and has accomplished a lot as a judo player. However, this tape definitely could have benefitted from a bit more planning and perhaps a bit more common sense. For example, in the section with warm-up exercises, the camera is, strangely, on the group of kid students, rather than the black belt instructor leading the warmups ( we see her feet - that's it). Nothing against kids, but if anyone has seen a junior class in any form of martial arts, there is a lot of uncoordinated movement and giggling action. Fine if this was a ""Judo for Kids"" tape, but  it's not. Also, at the expense of brevity, we see the students going through the entire set of each exercise long after the execution is obvious. Much more useful beginner info could have been packed into the tape. The portion of the tape dealing with throws shows way more promise, but that's the last actual instruction presented.
  The biggest jab, though, is that if you are planning on watching the 45 minutes of instruction length touted on the box cover, prepare to throw said box at the screen. The actual running time is about 30 minutes, after which we are ""treated"" to 15 minutes of commercials for the other fine videos ( karate, aikido, etc. etc.) available.
  Black Belt Magazine, you deserve a swift kick ...for putting out such inadequate and misleading product - especially considering how huge the magazine is and the budget you could muster, and I think you've done Mr. Nishioka a disservice by putting his name on a tape that looks like it was produced in someone's garage.",1028246400,4,1596,4.665480427046264
