1627083,4,B00005MKN7,I WASN'T EXPECTING MUCH BUT THE FILM HAD SOME VERY FUNNY MOMENTS. FOR A LOW BUDGET MOVIE THE LOOK WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND BELIEVABLE.

7945844,2,B00005MKN7,"WAITRESS! (1981) Is what the ancients used to call a ""sex comedy"". It's also one of those movies that make you wonder what in the name of all that is unholy, could have convinced someone that it would be a good idea to produce it! Starring no one in particular, and filled w/ idiot sight gags and dialogue, WAITRESS! is sort of like a grounded version of AIRPLANE!, minus the hilarity and fun. Soooo, it comes as no surprise that TROMA has a hand -and probably a foot- in this! Unfortunately, the lead-lined ""jokes"" come fast, and leave big marks on our scorched brains, before thudding through the floor! Yes, I know, the whole reason for the movie was to be an excuse to show cute women in skimpy clothes, or naked. That's fine, but the sheer misery of this cinematic kidney stone is enough to negate any / all nakedness! It helps -somewhat- to remember that waaay back when WAITRESS! was made, there was no internet, and this kind of stuff seemed ""risque"", even ""naughty"". Unfortunately, to anyone who didn't grow up in the time period, this is just an insufferable specimen of fossilized whale-smegma, from another age! Best watched from a safe distance of, say... 50 miles!...",1501718400,3,1181,4.655502392344498
