The film promises a lot of cheese, but doesn't completely deliver, except for maybe the death by paintball scene, which could have been better, Not worth the effort. However, if you liked this one you might also try ""Attila"" which was worse because it was filmed during the day and you could see what was happening,

8341488,1,B001TI5PYI,"""StagKnight"" has an opening credit sequence that's quite original. Unfortunately, that's by far the best part of the movie. In my recollection, this is the worst movie to emerge from England in decades. The premise is simple: a bunch of English losers go on a weekend retreat in the woods for a bachelor party. The film serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of letting Dungeons and Dragons fanatics plan your getaway in a creepy shack in the woods. There's also some background about an murderous ancient knight, and a ritual that raises him from the dead (of course.) Needless to say this leads to a clash of cultures and senseless bloodletting.

It also makes for rancid cinema. The film attempts to mix comedy and horror in uneasy proportions, and slapstick, lots of Port-O-Potty hilarity (if there isn't enough in the film for you, don't worry: there's more in the deleted scenes,) multiple scenes of possibly the worst dancing ever in a motion picture, abysmal and repetitive digital special effects, a tremendously unpalatable script performed ineptly by idiotically costumed characters, exactly none of which are interesting in the least is the order of the day.

The film jumps back and forth between the gothic horror angle with the huge scary knight and brain-addled comic pabulum featuring hilarious situations like a flamboyant and fussy guy in a mud puddle. Oh, my ribs. The dialogue depends heavily on language that would possibly amuse dimwitted teenage boys (at best,) and is delivered by the talent-challenged cast in a variety of accents which try the viewer's patience in short order.

I could not recommend ""StagKnight"" any less to anyone for any reason. I love camp and B-movies of most any genre from most eras, but some movies are so bad they are just bad. This is definitely one of them.

On the positive side, it does come in a neon green plastic box, which makes it easy to identify, and therefore avoid, in a stack of DVD's.",1289952000,9,1958,4.8532934131736525
