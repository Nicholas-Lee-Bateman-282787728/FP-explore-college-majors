8216811,4,B000V6LT3K,"I was actually expecting a 1985 Spanish film when I bought this (shopping without my glasses again!) and was rather puzzled when I started watching this because it was obviously far more modern than 1985.  Well, this is a 2006 French film about some gangster types that take on, well, a bunch of strange stuff, like the living dead & some other supernatural beings, I guess.  This is super duper low-budget & I had to laugh at the part where there's a metal ball attached to a chain and a close up (bad move) reveals that it's actually a tether-ball.  Despite the low budget and limitations, once you're past about the first 20 or so minutes of this it gets strangely appealing, in a Euro-trash kind of way.  Lots of gunfire, lots of creepy make-up and plenty of weirdness overall.  Definitely this won't be for everyone though.  But it is in French for you foreign-film snobs.  4 out of 5.",1197244800,7,890,4.525
