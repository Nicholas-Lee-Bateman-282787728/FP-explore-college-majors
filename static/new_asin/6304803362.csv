925680,5,6304803362,"I'm not a true Juan Gabriel's fan, but I enjoyed tremendously watching this video.
So I do recommmend it to anyone that likes Msica Ranchera",1374278400,,140,4.64
925681,5,6304803362,"No solo las canciones y la voz de ambos es excelente, la msica del mariachi y el espectculo en escena mientras Juanga y Roco cantan hace este concierto una obra aparte de otros conciertos de mariacho. Es una obra obligada para el aficionado a los buenos cantantes y para los msicos de mariachi.",1371513600,,294,4.566037735849057
925682,4,6304803362,"This wonderful concert featuring the music of Juan Gabriel is well worth your consideration. The compositions are beautifully romantic, the performers spectacular, the setting gorgeous. It is very clear that these two ""Royals"" of Musica Mejicana had great admiration for each other as performers artists and friends. The video is ""dated"" (certainly not up to today's digital standards) but the music and ""emotion"" of the event more than makes up for the slightly dulled video.",1363305600,,476,5.36
925683,5,6304803362,"Now on DVD!  One noticeable thing about the transfer to DVD is that the sound is off a fraction!  It can be slightly distracting.  PLUS,  The 8 and  minute finale, ""Que Bonito Es Santa Fe"" is NOT included. It is on the VHS only.  Get the companion double CD!!

Combine the velvety sound of Rocio Durcal and the unique nasal voice of Juan Gabriel and you have a perfect beautiful blend; it is no wonder they were singing partners, their voice becomes one!

Add a full-size orchestra, a huge mariachi band, professional dancers, beautiful costumes, fun and passion, and you have a night to remember.

More than a reunion concert, it is a first-rate performance. You don't need to understand Spanish to experience the chemistry as they passionately sing to one another, especially when they duet on  ""El Destino""  and  ""Dos Favores"".

Beautiful costumes and dance
And while dancing is visual and universal, sit back for many dancing performances with the array of costumes, the swaying skirts, tapping boots, variety of scarves and sombreros and last, the exuberant faces as premium dancers sashay across a huge stage. The numerous colorful costumes with intricate detail reflect the traditional cultures.  Other songs include:  ""La Incertidumbre"";  ""Te Sigo Amando""; ""Sabes Por Que""; ""El Principio""  plus many more!

During a break for Gabriel and Durcal, a lengthy musical and dancing sensation, ""The Mexican Hat Dance"" enhances the celebration. Always a wonderful dance, musically appreciative and so enjoying to watch!

Juan - the superstar
Juan Gabriel an international superstar and songwriter credits selling over 20 millions albums worldwide and has many influential performers cover his music, including Rocio Durcal a partner and movie actress at one time. Sparks ignite again and what better way to enjoy this than to view it over and over. It is exceptionally entertaining!

Miguel and Amalia
In the audience, Miguel Acevas Mejia and Amalia Mendoza join Juan Gabriel and Rocio Durcal as the younger duo recognizes true icons of Mexican music. Although they don't sing, their voices are heard in one of the songs.

Orchestral sound
Included is an orchestral instrumental ""El Final"" with images of Gabriel and Durcal in their youth and later. The backdrop of this ""intermission"" is the continuous gorgeous view of rich blue ocean water as the tides rise. That sound of a full orchestra is soothing and captivating.

I highly recommend another spectacular DVD of music and dance:

Pero la discogrfica sigue sin oir porque es prepotente y no deben de saber que juntando a estos 2 artistas juntos suman 100 millones de discos vendidos con esta discografica. Un 10 para ellos dos y un 0 enorme para la casa de discos mas cutre del mundo(dimitan por favor!!!)",1090108800,5,666,4.850877192982456
925687,3,6304803362,"One of the most anticipated video-to-dvd transfers has to be the Juan Gabriel/Rocio Durcal concert, which was filmed in 1997 during their one-stop in Jalisco.  Although many rumors have been passed around over the cancelation of the tour, at least you have this lipsync version.  In this 16 track concert, you have to hand it to the spectacle the directors put;  flashing colored lights, dancers, and mariachi.  When first aired on television, the song ""Que Bonito Es Santa Fe"" was sung.  Unfortunately it is not included in this dvd version.  In regards to sound, you have two choices: Stereo or Surround.  No extra features included.  Music: B+ Sound: D",1090022400,16,655,4.944954128440367

But the highlight has to be the encore ""Que Bonito Es Santa Fe"", if not 10 minutes, pretty close.  It's great just to watch the dancers on this number.  Here, the entire musical production is full force. It is the culmination of a fabulous evening.  But, better yet, the double CD is just as grand!.........Rizzo",1020643200,4,2276,5.110512129380054
925689,5,6304803362,"Juntos Otra Vez is a detailed production of the finest quality. Backdropped by mariachi, traditional dancing, and a large video screen, stars Juan Gabriel and Roco Drcal perform to perfection in this 1997 concert in Guadalajara. Nearly all of the songs that are on the CD are on the video. The only downside to the concert is that Juan Gabriel is not spontaneous, not until the grande finale which is, indeed, grand. ""Que Bonito Es Santa Fe"" is presented as an encore and follows, yes follows, the roll of credits. In this 8 minutes and 18 seconds of sheer excitement, Juan Gabriel truly comes to life, performing with Roco perhaps the most vibrant duet of their careers.",986256000,,671,4.743589743589744
