4525736,2,B0051PLR06,"Choose follows the story of Fiona Wagner, a young woman who tracks down a serial killer that forces his victims to choose between one of two gruesome fates.  With the help of her detective father and a mysterious therapist, Fiona tries to discover the identity of the killer as he drags her into a deadly game of cat and mouse.

The good news about Choose is that it's shot better than most horror flicks that go straight to video.  The cinematography, color correction and cast make it a step above most Netflix fare.  B-List movie veterans Kevin Pollak (The Usual Suspects) and Bruce Dern (The Burbs) bring a bit of film experience to the show.

The bad news is that the concept behind the film isn't terribly original.  Choose borrows elements from Saw, Untraceable, and Seven.  The killer's gimmick gets old fast, and isn't consistent throughout the film.  The strongest part of the film is the intro, compared to the conclusion, and isn't saved by a final plot twist.

Katheryn Winnick is ridiculously hot as Fiona.  But tight undershirts aside, there's no nudity in the film.  There's little gore, although there are at least two scenes in the movie that would cause audiences to jump.

Choose is worth watching at least once if you're a diehard fan of horror thrillers.  But I definitely wouldn't recommend buying the DVD until after you've given it a rental.",1314057600,8,1366,4.761702127659574
4525737,2,B0051PLR06,This is girlfriend\wife horror.  'Choose' plays nicely with limited blood and deprivation.  So if you have to get it cause you want a horror you will do ok.  It is really limited by its own boundries but overall not very good and you have probably seen it before (and better).,1312243200,3,276,4.48
4525738,3,B0051PLR06,"""Do what I say and you live. I'm going to kill your mother or your father. You have 60 seconds to decide, choose, or I kill them both."" Journalism student Fiona (Winnick) becomes obsessed with the case of a serial killer. Her father (Pollak) tries to keep her away from the case he is working on, but the further she delves the more she thinks that her mother's death is somehow connected to this case. This is a movie that was pretty good, but had potential to be better. This movie seemed like it tried to copy ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and ""Untraceble"" with ""Saw"" mixed in. It didn't really get close to the standards of these movies, but it is still a good attempt. The acting was pretty good though and that helped. I think the main problem with this movie is that it didn't grab you with tension like a thriller should. It was OK, but had enough chances to be great and just never quite got there. Overall, ""Saw"" meets ""Untraceable"" with out the tension of either. An OK movie, nothing that hasn't been tried before though. That said, I did like it enough to say...I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I would.

*Also try - Scar & Untraceable",1311811200,3,1162,4.301369863013699
4525739,3,B0051PLR06,"The movie opens up with a young teen girl (played beautifully by Shana Dowdeswell)who has just discovered boys. She has really cool parents as she excitedly chats on her cell to her bff about a boy who looked at her and asked to copy her homework. You can't help but like her then suddenly she is thrust into a room where her parents are tied up by an intruder. The crazed man makes her choose which one of her parents must die, or the whole family dies. Her dad instructs her to choose him, which she does. The intruder also makes our teen do the killing. Cue credits.

The next scene teases us with student reporter Fiona Wagner (Katheryn Winnick)heading for the shower. She is spooked and soon her father, a policeman (Kevin Pollak) is there to calm her down. Her mother was a suicide victim... or was she? She gets an IM about her suicide. Other people in town are having to make sick choices...and in her suicide note her mother mentioned making a choice. The movie, which comes off as a whodunit, shows us a very ""clear"" silhouette of the mad man's face and we get to clearly hear his voice, although we never get introduced to his character.

Unfortunately the movie lacks giving us clues and the end comes off as a bit bizarre. Katheryn Winnick does her best to salvage a script that needed work. Kevin Pollack seemed to just be going through the motions.

The act of violence is not graphically shown, but rather we see the results.

No sex, no nudity, rare f-bomb.",1306627200,,1474,4.4684014869888475
4525740,4,B0051PLR06,This was a very good movie. I thought it kept my attention until the very end.,1430870400,,78,3.9375
4525741,4,B0051PLR06,"What we have here is one of those ""you have to stick with it movies"" movies. The prime performers were all very good, Kevin Pollack as the cop dad, his daughter the reporter Katheryn Winnick, the cop's young partner is very good and so are Nicholas Tucci as the killer??? and Bruce Dern for his quick turn in the movie. All the smaller parts (except for the family at the start) are just day players I'm guessing especially the snarky model, so bad. I can't tell you too much but there seems to be a reason for the victims that are chosen. I do like the very inventive ""choose"" thing....very cool and victim specific. Biggest problem for me was the last 10 minutes....HUH? What?",1419033600,2,678,4.475806451612903
4525742,5,B0051PLR06,"I love movies like this, which put people in unimaginable situations. I wish I'd purchased this instead of rented, because I'm sure to watch it again!!!",1415491200,,152,4.884615384615385
4525743,2,B0051PLR06,"Fiona gets IM'd by a killer who forces his victims to choose one fate or another....anyhoo....the movie is very Saw and Seven combined.  Fiona just so happens to be the daughter of the detective investigating the case...how convenient.  As the police and Fiona track down vague clues such as a library barcode which is no longer in use and just so happens to come from a closed detention center.  The film resolves itself with a reasoning behind the killings and the little surprise ending isn't very surprising.  It just seems so odd that not much investigating took place.  The main clue was a barcode?  Kevin Pollock is in the film and plays the father/detective and Bruce Dern plays a therapist.  I really like Bruce Dern but his role is less than 10 minutes long :(
I would watch Saw or Seven unless you are a fan of Katheryn Winnick who plays the lead role as Fiona.",1374624000,,872,4.551282051282051

4525745,2,B0051PLR06,"Choose is an ambitious horror movie, featuring a psychopath who makes their victims choose their fates, stating that every choice has a consequence. The story is a seemingly good one and the key to finding this person is finding the pattern, a good old fashion detective story. It's a very solid story too, in the beginning they actually pretend you have a brain, and let you try and figure some things out for yourself. Initially, I was fascinated with this film, but somewhere along the way they figured that we wouldn't get it and they started dumbing it down for us, leading to an ending that just destroys the film. I absolutely hate it, when I sit through and enjoy a movie, only to have it ruined at the end by some ridiculous, sensationalized, Hollywood ending that doesn't make any sense! The story was strong, the cast was great, and I was really into this thing, but like our economy, things just started getting worse and worse, leading up to an ending that was completely ridiculous. It's not a bad movie, in fact it starts out as a great movie, but if you decide to give it a try, I'm warning you ahead of time, you won't like how it ends!",1361491200,2,1153,4.469194312796208
4525746,3,B0051PLR06,"In this day and age, when the serial-killer idea (in books / movies / TV shows / websites / news headlines) has permeated our culture, a film about one of these odious creatures had better be A) unique, and / or B) extraordinarily well-done. CHOOSE is neither. While it does have good points, like the dripping hourglass and the whole ""bad vs. worse choice"" scenario, I still found myself feeling as though I'd seen it all before, in far superior films. Also, the story seemed rushed, w/ characters finding clues at light-speed, and making huge, unfounded leaps in logic. If you love movies about vengeful psycho / sociopaths, then you might enjoy this one. Just don't expect anything ground-breaking...",1359504000,2,703,4.915966386554622

This movie has a great storyline with a good mix of all the gore that comes with scary movies. Definitely would recommend this!",1342915200,,310,4.654545454545454
4525748,4,B0051PLR06,This film was extremely interesting from beginning to end. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have preferred a bit more content. There should have been better use of Bruce Dern. I hope there's  a sequel.,1323216000,,215,4.375
4525749,5,B0051PLR06,This was an thilling and exceiting moive that will have you on the edge of your seat.

8453039,5,B0051PLR06,"A quiet, atmospheric horror story with a surprisingly brutal concept. Mostly, this is a showcase for the talented Katheryn Winnick. I believe this was made before her role on Vikings. As usual, she delivers an intense, credible performance. It was also nice to see Kevin Pollak, who pulls double duty as the lead cop and the worried dad. This'll appeal most of all to fans of Ms. Winnick, Mr. Pollak, and the shock-horror genre.",1449100800,,428,4.797297297297297
