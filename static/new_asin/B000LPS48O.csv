8163261,4,B000LPS48O,Among the better Thomas anthologies you can buy. The stories are well done and character (not hardware) focused.,1204848000,2,112,5.277777777777778
8163262,2,B000LPS48O,"BEWARE, this does not come with George, but Lady.  If you are like me, you look for the great deals where the DVD comes with the free toy.  It is very disappointing because this is the THIRD time I ordered a DVD that misadvertised the toy.  My son loves the DVD, but it has episodes with George that I know he would have loved re-enacting.  Now I have to go buy George separately.  Again, very disappointing.",1204502400,5,408,4.315789473684211
8163263,5,B000LPS48O,"My little Thomas fan loves any of the Thomas DVD's, no matter how many times he watches them. They are his favorite and I don't think that will change for a very long time. Thomas provides great life lessons like sharing, caring, and friendship. They get a thumbs up from me as well!",1174262400,3,283,4.3584905660377355
