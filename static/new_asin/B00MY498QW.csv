6604547,5,B00MY498QW,"These three-and-a-half minute shorts retain the character designs of Mickey and his pals from around 1930, but are set in the 21st century, in such recognizable locations as Central Park, Tokyo, and Brazil, and sometimes aren't even in English; there are episodes in which the (minimal) dialogue is entirely in French, Chinese, or Portuguese, for example. These cartoons are also great to look at, with stylized but elaborately detailed backgrounds, and most importantly, they're laugh out loud funny.

Mickey is still a good-hearted everyman, overcoming impossible obstacles to accomplish seemingly simple goals; the series, masterminded by animator Paul Rudish, marries the broad, surreal slapstick comedy of the silent era with a smart, contemporary sensibility that's just subtle enough to let viewers of all ages enjoy the gags on multiple levels (""Yodelberg,"" for example, is a tribute in all but name to Tex Avery).

As most good comedy it transcends age, I find all of my children from age 2 years to 6 years of age (and myself) entertained by this. I like to play in the vehicle at night because it is ""shorts"" it does not upset the children (or myself to wait a minute or two) when then short is done to leave the car.",1411689600,5,351,4.0285714285714285
6604549,5,B00MY498QW,"Season 1 of the new Mickey shorts, seen on Disney Channel and Disney XD, is already out now, exclusively at Walmart! It's been that way since August 26th. This short series combines the wild and crazy antics of the shorts from Mickey MouseWorks and Disney's House of Mouse, with the rubber hose-type gags of Mickey's original black-and-white shorts from 1928 to 1930, and a level of Flash animation that seems pretty fluid most times, plus cameos from a bunch of stars from Disney's major animated features and other stuff throughout the season, as the bonus short documentary proves; and nearly all the shorts so far run 3-and-4/5ths minutes each, while Potatoland runs 7-and-a-third minutes long. If you don't wanna wait until December 2nd to get this release, go ahead and see if Walmart has it! It's a shame that most of the hour-long classic Disneytoon shorts DVDs ever made, are in the Disney Vault, and any remaining new copies cost arms-and-legs here and on eBay. They too, would be a thrill for my sister and niece! It would also be amazing if Disney ever went back on Roy E. Disney's word to never put the Mickey MouseWorks/House of Mouse shorts on non-holiday DVDs in the USA. After all, Universal has recently put episodes of the (new) Woody Woodpecker Show on Woody's own Halloween and Christmas DVDs, for the first time ever in the USA! Who knows if we'll ever see new collections of classic Disneytoon shorts on DVD or Blu-ray, besides Mickey's Christmas Carol, since Disney doesn't make Treasures tins anymore, in favor of their endless Blu-ray mania. Why not help them along by getting season 1 of the new Mickey shorts on DVD, especially if you or your kids crave zany toon humor from yesteryear!",1410912000,14,1714,4.793918918918919

My family loves these up-to-date cartoons. They are hilarious!

There are some other really weird ones too that make me cringe. One I remember is goofy eating Mickey and Minnie and they are in his stomach eating dinner.

I was able to watch a few with my little cousins and they enjoyed them as much as me. The animation style has a very retro feel to it and the characters capture the magic of the Disney universe. The humor is silly, but nothing offensive, I had no problem watching these with my little cousins. If your an uptight person with no sense of humor, these may not be for you, but for those of us who enjoy to laugh, these are great.

""Mom, this is weird; can we just go play outside?"" was the response I received from putting their ""surprise!"" on for them. Reminder to parents too; do not makey mistake. Mickey is safe right? Always preview movies before you let your kiddos watch. I was grossed out and so mad it wasn't the old school mickey. :(

It might be ok for your family. I was telling my husband and he was laughing at some of the ""jokes"" from it but my kids are too young for that humor in my opinion and will not be watching it again.",1470700800,6,676,4.1603053435114505

6604595,5,B00MY498QW,"I love this collection! I initially found these shorts on Facebook and YouTube and noticed the retro-inspired styling and fast-paced look. The dark humor shown reminded me of House of Mouse and Mouse Tracks during the 1990s, along with other cartoons that I've loved. Watching these brings a chuckle from many parts of each short. Even though the shorts are almost too short, they pack each episode with loads of gags, fun humor and fast-paced insanity. From what I've learned, the original Mickey Mouse was more down-to-earth, somewhat rebellious, but was always there for his friends. His attitude has softened over the years, making him more likable to younger audiences. The characters also tend to break the 4th wall and address little quirks about themselves that were rarely or never addressed before within the shorts. These shorts harken back to the old black and white Mickey cartoon shorts but with an updated look and feel to them. I think any Mickey Mouse fan would enjoy these.

I also noticed some of the shorts I caught online aren't included in this collection, so I'm assuming there will a season 2. I hope!!",1468195200,5,1126,4.895287958115183

6604611,4,B00MY498QW,"While short animated pieces are beginning to make a bit of a comeback before Pixar and Disney animated features, they don't have the audience they once did.  Disney is looking to change that with a series of shorts on The Disney Channel focusing on their original star, Mickey Mouse.  The first group of those cartoons are collected in Mickey Mouse Season 1, and any fan of the classic Disney characters will love it.

Now, if you sit down expecting a TV show, you will be disappointed.  These harken back to the golden age of the shorts, the late 1930s.  There is no continuity between shorts, and there is no attempt to create any.  In one, Mickey is making a delivery of croissants in Paris.  In the next, hes climbing the Swiss Alps.  Goofy is a friend in one, running a lunch counter in another, and a spooky character in a third.  Treat each as its own story, and youll be fine.

And youll want to treat each one separately because there are some great shorts here.  For some of them, Mickey is on his own, such as the short that finds him trying to take a picture of a baby panda at a zoo.  Others involve him and Minnie, such as the one where he is trying to avoid causing an avalanche in the Alps while he climbs up to meet her.  The rest of the gang can get into the act, such as one where Mickey and Minnie try to fix Donald and Daisys relationship and cause more problems.  Then theres poor Goofy who comes along on a date and becomes a third wheel.  Speaking of Goofy, he finally has to act like a dog when taking Plutos place at a dog show.

There are a couple of these shorts that are just weird, or end weirdly, but they are the exception.  I find most of them to be fun and creative.  Like the old shorts, they aren't necessarily dialogue heavy.  You need to be watching to follow the story and catch all the gags.  There are some wonderful sight gags in these shorts you will absolutely love, too, worthy of the classics.  They do include brief gags that include jabs at characters from Disney animated movies or the parks, and these Easter eggs are always fun to spot.

About the only thing that doesnt work for me is the style.  They designed it to harken back to the 30s animated shorts, but theyve also included a bit more modern feel to it.  Even after watching all of these shorts, it still doesnt quite work for me.  I cant completely place my finger on why, but its a small issue.

This first season consisted of 19 shorts, and they are all included in this collection.  All but one are 4 minutes long.  That exception is Potatoland, which is close to 8 minutes long.  This one finds Donald and Mickey going to great lengths to make Goofys lifelong dream of visiting the potato themed amusement park come true.  Fans of Disney parks will absolutely love it.

It's a kick to see the characters rendered in not-quite classic style, and there's a fun level of energy to all the cartoons presented here, but (quite contrary to those reviewers who praise these shorts as being like the ""old"" or ""classic"" cartoons) it's nothing at all like Mickey Mouse.

6604654,1,B00MY498QW,"I got these, thinking they'd be close to the ""innocent"" shorts of Mickey Mouse/Disney days of yore. I was wrong. The cartoons were touted by my 8- and 6-year-olds as ""inappropriate"" because ""they take their clothes off,"" and ""the dog takes off his arm and starts beating (another character) with it."" Hearing this I was a little surprised, and then realized this brand of ""humor"" is more in the vein of today's gross or dark humor such as SpongeBob or even old school Ren and Stimpy. While I admit this is just not our family's brand of humor and we try to keep it clean, I was just surprised to see this coming from Disney in the form of Mickey Mouse. What happened to the shorts and melodies of the 40's and 50's? My fault: buyer beware!

6604655,5,B00MY498QW,"My kids and I love these cartoons.  They have a retro feel, but a modern twist.  I've seen some reviews on here that say the humor isn't ""kid friendly.""  I guess it all depends on your kids and on your comfort level regarding content.  I personally found nothing objectionable.  The humor is slapstick in nature and a throwback to the original 1920s and 1930s Mickey Mouse cartoons, which many people probably forget were produced before the age of Hollywood censors, so they got away with a lot more.  There are some things in the cartoons that are clearly aimed to get a chuckle from adults, but it is very tame and would fly over the heads of most impressionable kids.  If you are a fan of Mickey Mouse, or in funny cartoon shorts in general, you will get a kick out of these.  I am so glad they were put into one DVD, as I knew I wanted to have them in our collection from the moment we first started watching them on The Disney Channel.

She often falls asleep when we play videos for her, but she was riveted to the set when this one played, and she said she liked it.  I chose it mainly because the Mickey in this one looked like the Mickey she remembered as a child, but it turned out that everything about the stories was great.

We have an older Dynex Blu-Ray/DVD player (from Best Buy) and this DVD seemed to freeze up the player. It would just stay on the Dynex home screen and none of the remote control buttons would work. I called Disney customer service (or Buena Vista or whoever makes this DVD) and they tried different things, but it just would not play. Finally after letting it just sit on the home screen (while I was talking to the rep for about 5-minutes) it started playing! I think it has something to do with the fact that it's a dual-layer disc, so it takes a little longer for the DVD player to read it.

6604676,3,B00MY498QW,"I was very excited when I first saw one of these brief 'toons, and couldn't wait to get the set. However, as Chesterton said, ""Art, like morality, consists of drawing the line somewhere"". Rudish and company don't know where to draw the lines. They may not even know the universe has lines. Chuck Jones used to read Chesterton and even used him as the character of G.K. Chickenhawk. But it's clear the people making cartoons like this, Family Guy, South Park, and a great many modern cartoons haven't read Chesterton and don't get it. They think decadence makes good art. Following Chesterton, I think it makes bad art. Here, as exhibit A, is some of the bad art it makes.

Cartoons, runs the revisionist history so prevalent these days, exhibit anarchy in their early days that is so sadly missing now and many are heroically trying to bring back. But that's not correct. Animated cartoons came from Vaudeville and slapstick, they came from innocence, and many would argue that without that essential ingredient, you don't have a cartoon. ""All art is about limits"", Chesterton notes. He wrote that around a hundred years ago, when attempts were made to evade limits of any kind. The people who, failing to learn from history, are trying to bring back that period today simply look foolish.

The best example of that on here is the cartoon that tries too hard to be decadent, New York Weenie. An example of an actually funny and witty cartoon, the sort that ought to have set the standard for this set, and have brought it to the high Disney (Walt) bar of the past, is Croissant de Triomphe. That's a truly funny and well-paced, well-timed, which is to say limited, cartoon. But this is not at all a set ""for the whole family"" as the blurb writer claims. Like the plethora of unwatchable shows ground out by mammoth studios today, here's yet another made by people who don't get it. What could have been a small triumph is instead a colossal failure.",1426809600,4,1949,4.662790697674419

6604682,5,B00MY498QW,"Being a huge old school Disney fan I first saw these on the Disney channel and thought, ""What have they done to my beloved Mickey? Has he become some sort of Samurai Jack /Ren and Stimpy hybrid abomination?"". But I swallowed my initial asthetic horror and watched the cartoon from start to finish. It was short and it was colorful and it was spastic and elastic and it...was...magnificent. FINALLY Disney hit the nail on the head with an attempt to update, but still keep true, to it's most beloved of mascots. These shorts are pure gold.

They are entertaining, and truly cartoonish, they are stylistic but stay true to the characters we have grown up with. It has the disney magic of being entertaining to all ages, and offensive to none. The jokes for adults are modern but still go unnoticed to the tykes but it is never unsuitable for the little ones. Parents can actually sit and enjoy a cartoon with their child without having to stomach long pauses  while we are obnoxiously pleaded with to yell for swiper to stop swiping (or something equally idiotic).

These cartoons are back to what cartoons are supposed to be... FUN, visually stimulating and highly animated. Everyone enjoys them and after the initial shock at a new and stylistic version of our favorite mouse, I began to realize the art is quite stunning. It was a breath of fresh air to see a cartoon living up to it's genre and is a welcomed break from the usual children's shows most adults must suffer through. Bravo Disney!

6604686,1,B00MY498QW,"I get it, a lot of people like this... that's fine if you know what you are purchasing. But this is not for everyone's little kids, and the packaging will easily fool you. Read on, and decide if this is right for your kids:

My young daughter loves Mickey Mouse and she loves the gentle humor of the old Silly Symphonies. Mickey Mouse is 85 years old, so it's easy to assume the ""first season"" goes back pretty far. It's easy to assume Mickey Mouse won awards back then just as the packaging says. It's easy to assume someone colorized the old cartoons. The problem is, this is a TV series from 2013 and it's not as family friendly as I would expect from Disney. We don't watch much TV, so we don't know every character on every kids channel. It's easy to assume Disney is trustworthy, especially Mickey Mouse right?

My Valentines Day present to my little princess shows dogs pissing on fire hydrants, flies buzzing around rotted corpses, and a pig construction worker going into an outhouse to S H I T on Goofy who is stuck in the plumbing. Some of the shorts are ok, Croissants was the best in my opinion. But some scenes reminded me of Ren and Stimpy. The outhouse scene was too South Park for my family. I like both of those shows when the kids are asleep, but this Mickey Mouse left my girl crying. If you've seen the TV show, and that humor flies past your kids, buy it, you'll probably like it. But if you are expecting the G-rated Mickey Mouse of the past, save your $10.",1423958400,14,1480,4.3393501805054155

Anyway,  I got this for them for Christmas. I think they liked it, but it was hard to say because they got 100 other gifts and were numb to the excitement of receiving things. American children....  It was definitely a win though!",1422230400,,402,4.346666666666667

6604697,5,B00MY498QW,"I don't have this DVD yet, but I have seen these cartoons elsewhere & being a big fan of the Disney shorts, they are very fun to watch. In fact, as with past Disney projects, there are not a lot of pop culture references in them so a lot of the scripts would of worked just as well back in the day (For instance, the plot of the short 'Bad Ear Day"" is very similar to 'Mickey's Delayed Date') These shorts are destined to become classics & I highly recommend it to all Disney fans out there (or just animation fans in general). Its also a great homage to Walt Disney & the staff who had worked hard to make these classic characters come to life!!!",1421452800,,647,4.142857142857143
6604698,5,B00MY498QW,"Brilliant reimagining of the classic Mickey but with the zaniness and energy of today's animators.  I bought this on the box art alone, being an animation snob I expected these to be dreadful, I never in a million years thought Disney would ever produce a Mickey cartoon that could stand with the truly classic era of both Disney and animation, that wild frontier of the 1930s, but do it they did!  Let the helicopter parents who are raising the next generation of bubble wrapped whiners call these inappropriate all they want, they are not.  If you have a sense of humor, if you love cartoons, and if you want your kids to grow up with taste then pop these in as a family and get ready to laugh.  All ages humor and absolutely nothing that isn't fine for fans of all ages.",1421452800,21,773,4.422535211267606

I'd never seen the show before, but for $9, I bought it on a whim for Christmas. The whole family watched it later that day, and we all loved it. The animation style reminds me of Ren & Stimpy except less disgusting and the plot lines are more tame (appropriate for a toddler.)

When I saw they were all on a DVD it was a no brainer. I bought it! I I love the classic feel of these cartoons with a modern edge on the humor. My husband and I think they are just as funny as my kids do. I think they did an awesome job putting these cartoons together. We are big Disney fans and I am already excited for when there are enough shorts to put together a Season 2. There are 19 shorts included and it lasts over an hour to watch it all through. My kids do not get bored (3 1/2 and 1 1/2) because they are short and switch to a new one so quickly.,1418083200,2,732,3.8223684210526314

8675303,1,B00MY498QW,"I hadn't researched this particular DVD and instead, just relied upon the Disney reputation and the cover pic of the retro steamboat Mickey. I watched these for myself, expecting good ole Mickey. I was shocked to see these were complete rip-offs of the Ren and Stimpy Show.. really meant for adults, yet the title had a copyright of 1963 or so.  Obviously created post-2000, the animators were influenced heavily by Ren & Stimpy. This was purchased for my 3 year old granddaughter. She will never see this DVD,
From the adult perspective, I happen to be a Ren and Stimpy fan and own a box set, but this ""mix"" of Disney/ Mickey Mouse with the classic Ren & Stimpy closeup of a hotdog with a stuck-on used band-aid, hair, and flies is not even original and frankly a total abomination of Walt Disney's philosophy and family values. If you want the shock value and hilarity of adult humor, just get a Ren & Stimpy cartoon collection. The novelty of Mickey ""and gross-out"" is not a good mix.
If you want the Disney classics, instead of Disney crap, get the Disney Treasures or Classic Favorites DVDs, where you will find the real genius of Disney.",1532044800,,1143,4.602941176470588
