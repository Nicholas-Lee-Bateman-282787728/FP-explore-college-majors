196798,4,1582705674,"Tom is a solid resource in the metaphysical community.  I think most people who have awakened in the past 20 years at least know about Tom if not having actually spent hours and hours with his materials like I did.

Tom's fans will find alot to love about this film.  It's part-biographical (with cartoons) and part concert.  The concert parts are a little too long.  You don't watch DVDs to listen to Tom singing, so the mix of media and approach here is a little off.

Overall it's a great piece. It could have been edited down from 90 to 60 minutes.  Worth a viewing.",1427414400,3,570,4.371428571428571

196802,5,1582705674,"This is a beautiful film, as much a treat for the eyes as for the ears. Whoever put this documentary together could teach a master class in the art. We purchased the deluxe version from Kenyon's site, not yet available on Amazon.",1423958400,7,229,4.476190476190476
196803,5,1582705674,"This film is astonishingly beautiful. Modern life can be mind-numbing. We need to be astonished and lifted up in this way. Tom Kenyon masterfully combines years of classical scientific training about neuroscience and the brain with his remarkable humor, generosity and creative genius. His voice and range are unlike anything that I have encountered. This work is full of joy. It is brimming with insight about how certain sounds can help us heal. I did not realize how much my psyche, heart and spirit needed this film and these unique sounds until I experienced it. Buy it.",1422144000,14,575,4.938144329896907

196826,5,1582705674,"Tom Kenyon's story is fascinating and this movie is very nicely produced. I loved the animated sequences, which helped to express Kenyon's wonderful sense of humor within the context of what is of course a very serious subject. His sound meditations were exquisitely beautiful and deeply moving. I hope to experience a live performance someday!",1440460800,4,344,5.2727272727272725
196827,5,1582705674,"Takes concentration and patience.  Author traveled the world over learning the music of other cultures and
the spiritual meaning and application of  many instruments.  Have loaned it to a friend, but looking forward
to watching it again.",1438560000,2,237,5.351351351351352

196833,5,1582705674,"Love this movie; at times (the musical parts) it's very trance inducing. At other points Tom explains his background and his view of human potential. I had actually never heard of Tom Kenyon prior to viewing this film; I came across this because I'm always on the look out for spiritual documentaries, and you can find some good ones on Amazon. Glad to see Inner Worlds Outer Worlds on here now (unrelated to this film, but amazing in its own right). I'm a Healer and would recommend this particular movie for anyone interested in Healing, meditation and the power of sound. If you're a skeptical person like myself, approach this with an open mind. What I love about this the most is that Tom clearly has found his Path and loves sharing his gifts with others, as do I!",1427500800,10,770,4.546762589928058
