1200794,5,B00000F2PH,"I have been searching all over for a copy I can call my own.  The experience is akin to watching your blood boil without so much as blinking or lifting the corner of your lips.  It proves that the most direct route to passion is the most stylized, that supreme passion is annihilation through indifference to what might engulf you.  It is also one of the most affecting accounts of a man's sense of loss, of losing a woman who is so close that she will allow herself to feel and set your rhythm and so far that a mortal life is never to be had with you.",1032480000,,553,4.101851851851852
1200795,5,B00000F2PH,"I did not watch this movie with English subtitles, but the emotionally-charged performance of the leading characters, under the direction of Carlos Saura, more then compensate for the dialogue. It is similar to watching a beautiful opera without following the words, where the attention and sympathy of the audience is carried by listening to the tone of voice, the facial expression, and-- most importantly the movement-- of the leading roles. We know what, essentially, is going on.

But this movie is not of the opera Carmen, it is a fictional account of the MAKING of the opera Carmen, within the movie. The plot variates on the theme of ""a play within a play"" often confusing the audience as to which we are watching. The events inside and outside of the play become more and more similar until they intersect at the climax-- where the action of the leading characters is carried out while the music from the opera plays in the background.

This movie shows the making of the Carlos Saura dance interpretation of the Carmen opera, and was my first exposure to the exhilirating Flamenco dance. In ""Carmen"" the dance combines forms of tap dance, tango, and opera to create-- in a word, EXALTATION of the human body through movement. It is expressive while ruthlessly exact, and at once dramatic, energetic, heroic, and sexual.

I give this movie 5 stars, for brilliance in acting, brilliance in plot, and brilliance in choreography. Although a tragedy, the characters have the human integrity requisite of any high drama, and the theme of the movie follows the theme of the dance-- human integrity itself.",1028332800,32,1608,4.92619926199262

7906476,5,B00000F2PH,"I saw this in a movie theater years ago.  The reaction of the audience was unforgettable -  it appeared people held their breath and then let out an audible, collective sigh at the end of some of the intense dance scenes.",1346544000,,221,4.365853658536586
7906477,5,B00000F2PH,"I had an old tape of this wonderful presentation of Carmen and foolishly lent it out only to have it returned with half of it taped over with a soap opera.  To have a clean, perfect copy is a pleasure.  The timing, service and product were perfect.  And, a special thanks to the seller for that extra touch!  Wish I could give it ten stars!",1280880000,,340,4.184615384615385
7906478,5,B00000F2PH,"For anyone who is a dance enthusiast, enjoys high drama or would like to experience one amazing dance film by the great Spanish filmmaker, Carlos Saura, this is for you!
Many are familiar with the popular French opera and novel about the randy, irrepressible Carmen, a cigarette girl, who encounter the young solider, Don Jose, seduces and leads him on, and drives him wild with jealousy.  Carmen is a fickle and independent woman who will answer to no one and lives only for the moment.  The plot of the film is loosely based on this story, and is actually a tale within a tale.  The masterful Antonio Gades, portrays Antonio, a flamenco dancer/instructor who is searching for the perfect female dancer to portray Carmen in a flamenco version of the story.  He chooses, not the best, nor strongest dancer.  He chooses a woman who is driven by her passion and raw sensuality, who happens to be named Carmen.  He proceeds to mold her into the dancer he desires for the play., then proceeds to fall in love with her, and grows progressively obsessed with the young, bewitching woman.

The film is an intriguing juxtaposition of re-enactments, high drama and electrying flamenco dance sequences.  Gades sets the stage on fire.  His marvelous timing, stage presence and footwork burns a hole in your heart.  Also, Maria Del Sol, the young dancer portraying Carmen., is at once seductive and sinverguenza (shameless), and you can't look away.  This is especially apparent during the scene where she says, ""Devour me, Antonio....""  In a word, ""Whoa!""

A note:  There are scenes of sexuality, profanity, and the subject matter, in general, is not suitable for young children.  Although, it was rated R when it came out in 1983, I would say that it could pass for PG-13 by today's standards.",1107561600,21,1783,4.838283828382838
7906479,5,B00000F2PH,"Made in 1983 the story is about Antonio Gades, a superb male flamenco dancer, staging a flamenco version of the opera Carmen.  The first part of the movie is about Gades and his talented friends creating a flamenco version, part of which is the search for the right woman to play the role of Carmen.  But the woman they choose is a Carmen in her own right; there is love, betrayal, jealousy, lust, deception on and off the stage as the life of the players becomes a reflection of the play. The story is good, but the true star is the director's love for flamenco; his staging of the movie, the beat and counter beat of music and dancing, and the camera work is all fantastic.  A work of love that is very enjoyable.",1101600000,48,715,4.32089552238806
7906480,5,B00000F2PH,Antonio Gades is my favourite flamenco dancer ever!!!  There is simply nobody like him!  I want to buy a DVD widescreen version.,1090281600,12,128,4.7727272727272725
7906481,5,B00000F2PH,"This is a small, arty, and magnificent film!  Certainly a DVD version should be released.  Although all the dancing and music is amazing and highly entertaining, it is the interesting story - with its constant crosing over between the reality of the ""story"" and the reality of the performance (or story within the story) - that creates a depth lacking in most films.  The film also explores the relationship between director/actor, man/woman and the various ""politics"" and power issues within those relationships.  This film can be enjoyed through casual viewing as well as critical scrutiny - it holds up.  Overall a wonderful and rewarding viewing experience.",1070928000,5,661,5.19811320754717
