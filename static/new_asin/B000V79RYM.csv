You can think of it as the Hindi version of ""Lolita""  Acting is great....Amitabh of course is a king and a natural at what he does.  Newcomer Jiah Khan was pretty good considering this was her 1st movie ever.  I personally enjoyed this movie and thought it was such a beautiful yet sad love story.",1203984000,5,355,4.4
2931593,1,B000V79RYM,"Well:
I have never seen such a bad movie in my life. It is sin to even watch this movie. The concept of the movie is such a disgusting one that the good acting and the freshness of the actress is spoiled. It looks like that Amitabh Bachchan raped her career for the sake of looking young for himself. Even ramgopal verma's good direction was helpless to restrict the interference of Amitabh in the movie script. He played with the movie. He is playing wrong practice in the present scenario. He is just taking advantage of his position and money. It is appearing a devil's work at his age. I recommend nobody should watch this movie except those frustrated old people who still do not feel their responsibility towards the society.",1185580800,3,731,4.587786259541985
8216987,4,B000V79RYM,"Amitabh Bachchan---the naked soul.  That's his secret.  The voice is wonderful but the eyes far more eloquent.  This man surely must be the greatest actor on the planet.  And what he brings to the role of Vijay in this movie is astonishing. Even though I don't know much Hindi, I get all his later movies,[ even those that don't have subtitles]  because Bachchan makes you understand everything. People who don't. appreciate or understand this film either don't like romantic feelings between the generations or can't comprehend why they happen. ""Nishabd"" tries to explain and I think does a wonderful job.  The wife was miscast, though, although she acquitted herself well.  Young women playing older ones is fine on the stage, but the camera is too exacting.  There are plenty of seasoned Indian actresses who still look good enough to make it believable that a very handsome man like Vijay would have chosen them.  Or perhaps they didn't like the part--who knows?  Marriages go stale and little can be done about it.  Routine feels like the path to death and sometimes a person grabs at a chance to feel alive, even while knowing  full well nothing good can come of it.",1506038400,,1172,4.805
8216988,4,B000V79RYM,"This is the usual Lolita story.  Older man falls in love with impetuous young girl.  In this case, Bachchan as usual drives the movie but Jiah Khan holds her own.  The way Bachchan or Vijay, as his character, describes how he got involved in this, how it happens to him is very powerful and also how it ends emotionally for him.  I recommend it simply because this type of thing can happen in real life and it takes someone of Amitabh Bacchan's professional genius to tell the story.",1424390400,,483,4.454545454545454
8216989,1,B000V79RYM,"This film was a great disappointment. The script was poorly written, leaving plot holes so large they resembled black holes sucking the light and life out of this film. The language was odd and wooden in most scenes.

The characters were two-dimensional, and that's being generous. No character development. No chemistry between the stars. The character of Jia was written/acted as spoiled pre-teen instead of a worldly young woman. Amitabh Bachchan's character had a few scenes that had more emotional depth, but they were scenes without the character of Jia.

Give this movie a pass. Not worth the time to download it, let alone watch it.",1414800000,,640,5.028301886792453

8216991,4,B000V79RYM,"AB is awesome in this movie. He falls in love with his daughters 18 year old friend, and what happens is predictable, but yet, it is entertaining how it all unfolds.",1406073600,,165,4.354838709677419
8216992,5,B000V79RYM,"Really good film. Would have been even better if they used the poision Ivy approach and made the girl unbalanced. In some scenes you can clearly glimpse that Jiah Khan was more than capable of tackling a role of that calibre.

As it is the film will stand as a huge question mark on the what might have career of Jiah Khan, and a loving valentine to her beauty.",1373328000,,361,4.231884057971015
8216993,3,B000V79RYM,"I love this actor, but this story was a bit too risqu.  Young girl, old man, daughter wife, everyone loses. Poor casting, because the wife looks like a young woman, made up to be an older woman, but it doesn't work.",1368662400,,215,4.2439024390243905
8216994,4,B000V79RYM,Its a unexpacted deep emotional movie .A men that has stopped living  a long time ago. Will start to live again when he meets JIA.iTS A RAW BEAUTIFUL MOVIE!,1351987200,3,156,4.379310344827586
8216995,3,B000V79RYM,"I watched it only now. Great script. Amitabh Bachchan's performance was sterling. So what prevented the movie from becoming truly memorable?
1. The length. It should have been longer where the relationship between Amitabh and Jia should have been shown developing into a very strong bond, emotionally and physically. And even her exit should have been more emotional.
2. The background music - which at most palces gave the movie the feel of a horror/suspense thriller
The last 3-4 minutes of monologue were brilliant.",1315785600,,518,5.178571428571429
8216996,1,B000V79RYM,"plot akin to Lolita but lacks pulse, dimension. acting lacks luster.  it's a poor attempt to copy a story of intensity!",1299024000,,119,4.666666666666667
