8268753,2,B00187V92W,"The film opens like a classic grindhouse and then dies right after the credits. Justin (Denton Blane Everett) is being released from prison after spending 10 years for murder, a crime we find out more about later. He ends up stealing autos for Manny (Russell Fuentes) in order to help finance his sister Haydon's (Landon Dunning) rock career. Haydon disowns her brother. Justin steals the car of a heroin dealer, Gino (Vincent Riverside ) who is not too pleased because his junk was in the trunk. Gino decides to get revenge.

The plot sounds fairly decent. The characters were not well done. I didn't get interested in the cardboard Justin, nor did the film allow you to feel for the sister. I could have sided with Gino had they spent some time building his character grindhouse style. The film had a made for TV Lifetime theme to it and didn't attempt to grindhouse it into the plot.

Available on a Walmart 10 film multi-pack.
