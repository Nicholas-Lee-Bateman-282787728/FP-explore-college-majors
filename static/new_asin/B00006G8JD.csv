1753610,4,B00006G8JD,"Being a die-hard Angelina Jolie fan, I just had to see Life or Something Like It.  I wasn't too enthusiastic about going after viewing the TV trailer, but Jolie is such a terrific actress, I figured, ""How bad could it be?""  Well, the answer is NOT BAD AT ALL.  I expected a quirky comedy with the usual guy-gets-girl storyline.  What I got was something I could relate to.
Have you ever wondered if decisions you've made have made your life more or less meaningful?  Lanie (Angelina Jolie), a Seattle TV reporter, has 7 days to figure that out.  After an interview with a homeless, self-proclaimed prophet, she's not so sure.  You see, the prophet has predicted that, not only will she not get the big network job she's been striving for, but that Lanie will die the following week!  With the help of cameraman Pete (Edward Burns), Lanie works on making her life meaningful before time runs out.  And of course, in true romantic comedy fashion, she falls in love along the way.
Not only did I enjoy watching the movie, but I could tell that the actors enjoyed making the movie.  In my favorite scene, Lanie leads a crowd of striking transit workers in a rousing rendition of the Rolling Stones hit ""Satisfaction"".  You could tell Jolie & cast were having alot of fun with that scene.
It's a film that makes you think about the life we take for granted and the choices we make each day without a thought.
Go see this movie and you'll leave it like I did - with a smile on your face!",1020211200,26,1481,4.448148148148148
1753611,4,B00006G8JD,"Angelina has made a carreer out of playing physically tough women.  In ""Life or something like it"", she plays an emotionally strong women.  Angelina plays Lanie Kerrigan, a tv journalist who has a path set out for her life as well as her carreer.  Then, a homeless man with E.S.P. tells her that she is going to die in a week and a half.  Lanie must figure out what is important in life before it is too late.  Is it her job, her boyfriend, or the simpler things in life, like the laughter of children and taking the day off to go to a baseball game.  Whatever it is, will Lanie figure it out before its too late?  Angelina gives a heart string pulling perofrmance in this romantic comedy co-starring Ed Burns as the camera man with an attitude, and Stockard Channing as a Barbara Wlaters-esque journalist that Lanie aspires to be.
This is a wonderful movie.  Go see it, but bring your tissue box.",1020038400,8,897,4.393939393939394
1753612,4,B00006G8JD,"Lanie is a successful career woman who seems to have the perfect life, but when she discovers she will die in a week, she realizes that her life is far from perfect.
This film is filled with interesting chracters and a very intriguing situation. It makes you wonder what you would do if you found out you were going to die in a week. Is work really that important? Does it really matter if you eat a burger instead of a salad? Do you need to tell the ones you love just how much they mean to you? These are the type of thoughts that occur to Lanie and would most likely occur to everyone who was in a situation like this. It also makes you realize that a wasted second is too much time to lose. The theme is: one day will be the last day of your life and since you don't know when that day is coming, you need to live everyday as if it's your last day.
It may be a trite message but the story is unique and easy to watch. The quick pacing flows well with the story and the characters are well-rounded. If you are in the mood for a somewhat sappy film about living life to the fullest, then I highly recommend.",1020038400,11,1109,4.045454545454546
1753613,3,B00006G8JD,"""Life, or Something Like It"" is a romantic comedy with a better-than-average premise.  It attempts to address the question ""if you suddenly discovered that you might only have a week more to live, how would you spend that remaining time and what changes would you make to your life?""  Perhaps because this IS a romantic comedy, the best the film can manage to do within the tight strictures of the format is to raise a few of the more provocative issues surrounding the theme - those dealing with the meaning of life and the vagaries of fate, for example - then drop them so it can address itself to the customary clichs one would expect to find in a film of this genre.  One only wonders how a more serious-minded European filmmaker, for instance, might have tackled the same subject matter.
Angelina Jolie plays a beautiful, but thoroughly superficial and self-absorbed TV news reporter living a near-perfect life in Seattle.  Indeed, when we first meet her, Lanie Kerigan seems to have everything going for her: stunning good looks, a glamorous profession, a handsome major league ballplayer fianc, and now a major career advancement in the form of a regular spot on a national morning news program.  One day, however, her world comes crashing in when she meets up with a homeless man on the street, a self-styled ""prophet of God"" who tells Lanie that she will die within a week.  When all his other predictions begin to come true, Lanie realizes that this man may not be quite the lunatic or charlatan all her friends and acquaintances keep assuring her he is.
Given this setup, ""Life, or Something Like It"" can't help but grab our attention.  We wonder how we too would react to such a horrifying scenario if it were to suddenly present itself in our own lives. The problem is that the movie doesn't really do much with the material it has to work with.  Nothing Lanie does seems particularly thoughtful or meaningful when she is confronted with potentially imminent death: indulging in some halfhearted attempts to reconcile herself with an estranged sister and father, giving up her health-obsessive diet and exercise regimen, and dumping the fianc with whom she discovers she has nothing in common.  Considering the thematic potential of this material, the film always seems to be lagging several intellectual beats behind where it should be.  This is particularly true in the predictable love/hate relationship she shares with Pete, one of her cameraman coworkers.  Yet, oddly enough, it is this very pairing of Jolie with Edward Burns that gives the film its moments of greatest charm.  Both performers are so likeable in their understated warmth and vulnerability that we can't help liking and rooting for their two endearing characters.  Paradoxically, then, the film satisfies us most when it is at its least innovative.  The movie is at its worst in an embarrassingly unconvincing scene wherein a boozed-up Lanie, sans makeup and carefully groomed coiffure, leads a contingent of striking workers in a rendition of ""Satisfaction"" in the middle of a live TV interview.  Cloying moments like these merely serve to remind us that we are stranded in movie fantasy land when the film could, with a little more effort, have ascended to a much higher level.  (The film, incidentally, endorses a rather reactionary view of women in the workplace, arguing that a woman needs to consider whether achieving success in the corporate world is worth sacrificing a chance at achieving marital and familial happiness - a quandary that never seems to be posed to male characters in movies).
And this, alas, is the overall impression that ""Life, or Something Like It"" ends up generating.  Despite the fact that it has moments of quality and charm, the film, ultimately, feels like a case of lost opportunity.  One finds oneself leaving this film in a state of frustrating ambivalence: acknowledging that the film works on a level of superficial entertainment but knowing that, with a little more depth and insight, it could have amounted to so much more.",1019865600,8,4050,4.930882352941176
1753614,5,B00006G8JD,"I am a pretty big movie fanatic.  The list of my top ten favorite movies which includes movies like ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""Inherit the Wind"", and ""Twelve Angry Men"", but really no comedys.  Comedyies, I have found, tend to not really say much about life and lack substantial meaning.  When is the last time you got a revelation out of a Jim Carrey movie, though even I can quote the entire ""dumb and Dumber"" movie.
""Life or omething Like it"" really is one of those movies though that make the viewer look at their own life and ask the important questions ""do I have any regrets?"" and ""is it worth it?""  Jolie plays a oman that I think almost everyone can relate to in some way: she is somewhat insecure, was a bit of a loner as a child, and really strives in her job to be accepted.  Almost everyone nowadays is a little bit a slave to their job; it is inevitible because now it is one of the only ways to survive with enough money to eat.  But as Jolie's character slowly frees herself from the constraints of her job and her superficial life, she begins to see the really important things in life, like family and relationships in general.
Whether you believe in ESP or not, which I definitly do not, this movie is not so much about the actual phrofesy from the homeless guy, but more about a lady getting her life back.  It is a really endeering story with a touching ending.",1019779200,7,1388,4.335907335907336
1753615,4,B00006G8JD,"I have seen this movie and it is quite good.
Angelina is just deep enough of an actress to pull off the deeper themes of reevaluating your life that run throught the film, but she is also out there enough to pull off slightly ditzi blonde with a plan and make it convincing. Edwards burns is just doing his classic look, ""im scruffy, intelligent and cute"" look. The chemistry between them, is quite apparant, which makes the romantical part ever so much more believable.
As for the movie itself, it is fairly well written, and some of the other charcters have depth that is there but never verbalized, and doesnt need to be, because thats how life is.
It is a great date movie or girls night out movie depending on your preference. It has it all for a sparkling late spring movie, lots of wit, some deepish themes, and a sprinkle of romance to move things along.
All in all one of the better movies i've seen this year so far. :) Enjoy!",1019433600,16,936,4.385057471264368
1753616,4,B00006G8JD,"The trailer for ""Life..."" kinda got me puzzled. Angelina  Jolie who is noooo Michelle Pfeiffer who did ""Up Close And Personal"" plays a Seattle News Reporter Personality is given disturbing news about what is going to happen to her in the future.

1753846,4,B00006G8JD,"""Life Or Something Like It"" is an enjoyable romantic comedy despite a title that is too long and too generic.  The concept--A homeless man who sees the future tells an ambitious television newswoman that she has one week to live--is interesting.  The plot is well structured, and the theme, expressed openly in voice over at the end, is easy to agree with.
  Many people feel that Angelina Jolie was miscast in this movie, and, considering her roles in action movies or her films about the horrors of war, that might seem reasonable.  But, if you set aside that body of work and watch her in this film, it becomes obvious that she understands the genre and knows exactly what she is doing.
  Tony Shalhoub is excellent as Prophet Jack and Greg Itzin is a fine character actor.  This movie's shortcoming is that Edward Burns does not have the star stature to stand toe to toe with Ms. Jolie.  For most of a romantic comedy the leads are adversaries, so they must have equal status in the eyes of the audience.  The dialogue between Mr. Burns and Ms. Jolie is sharp, but it just doesn't crackle on the screen.  In Another comedy, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" the dialogue comes across much better because Ms. Jolie and Brad Pitt have equal standing.
  Even if you don't like romantic comedies, hang on until the ""bus strike"" scene comes along, and maybe you will join Ms. Jolie and drivers as they hop to the beat, pump their fists in the air, and belt out ""Satisfaction"" along with the Rolling Stones.",1401667200,,1493,4.567669172932331

The reason this movie originally got negative ratings and poor box office was because it was filmed in the summer of 2001 and was probably seen as a movie with a ""September 10th"" attitude.

After 9/11, the country was in a surly and cynical mood about anything that reminded people of superficiality that existed before the attacks.  At that time the movie came out, people were more in a mood for ""killing all the bad guys"" and ""turning countries into glass parking lots"" than romantic comedy.

This movie would have been a box office success if 9/11 hadn't happened but the late Osama Bin Laden had other plans and altered everyone's lives.",1306627200,,848,4.950704225352113
1753979,4,B00006G8JD,"I don't really understand any negative remarks here, especially considering Angelina Jolie's performance.  I know that this is not a movie to be taken serious, but when it comes to romantic comedies laced with a `message', there have been far worse.  Jolie is dynamic here, delivering one of my favorite performances from her (that Razzie nomination is rather ridiculous, for this deserved to be mentioned by the Globes in their `Comedy/Musical' category).  She completely captures what this character is all about, adding the right amount of snarky bite to her character's obvious emotional resistance, and her tender and believable shift from self-absorbed and guarded woman to that soft and heartfelt woman is of the perfect pitch.

But look at me getting ahead of myself here.

Angelina plays Lanie, a Marilyn Monroe-esque picture of perfection who gets the scoop of her life (she's a reporter) when she interviews a homeless man who professes to tell the future.  Apparently, Lanie is going to die soon.  Of course, why would she believe the words of a homeless man; but then again, he has accurately predicted the outcome of some sports games so maybe he knows what he's talking about.

So, what's a girl to do?

Well, if that girl is Lanie Kerrigan, she starts reevaluating her priorities and finding within herself the courage to change, for the better.

Sure, this is not anything new and it is nothing truly profound (it's funny to me when they try and make a moral statement in films like this) but it is fun and sharp witted, and while the realization of that said `prophesy' is somewhat forced for me, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment one feels while watching Angelina Jolie sink her teeth into a role that is really rich with many layers of complexity.  She is dramatic, romantic, comedic and poignant, and she handles each layer with elegance and dedication.

Say what you will, but she is top notch here!",1263254400,2,1927,4.859327217125382

When the first two predictions come true, Lanie really starts to worry.

This is a perfectly nice little movie, but it's instantly forgettable.  Picture a Meg Ryan romantic comedy without Tom Hanks or at least one tear-inducing scene.  Jolie is perky as the driven newscaster (despite a really hideous Pamela Anderson-hair do), but she's just not special enough to care about.  Her costar Edward Burns plays a John Corbett-Everyman dude, very low-key, charming, and philosophical, but again, nothing special and there aren't any sparks between them.

Critique: `Life Or Something Like It' is a surprisingly good though obscure little romance/comedy from '02 starring Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns. This is a very different role for the sexy Angelina showing a comedic, vulnerable side that I haven't seen before. Edward Burns also delivers a rather subdued but strong role as her cameraman, nemesis and potential love interest Pete. Tony Shalhoub has a small but important part as Prophet Jack, adding a certain quirkiness and surreal quality to the film that works extremely well.

1754009,3,B00006G8JD,"""Life or Something Like It"" is one of those films where the idea is intriguing, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The central character is Lanie Kerigan (Angelina Jolie), a hot young feature reporter for a Seattle television station who has a chance of her dream job for the network's morning show, ""AM USA."" Lanie is paired up with the station's best cameraman, Pete (Edward Burns), although these two clearly have a past that makes this a rocky relationship and assures us that they will end up together before too long. One day Lanie is out on the street filming an interview with Prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub), a homeless man who is supposedly psychic. During the interview Jack makes three predictions. First, the Seattle Seahawks will win their game 19-13. Second, it will hail the next day. Third, Lanie will die next Thursday. This last one gets her attention.

Of course Lanie is skeptical. But when the first two predictions come true, she starts to become concerned and when Jack offers another prediction that comes about, she really starts to freak. Somewhere in her background Lanie must have studied classical mythology, because she does not really try to thwart her fate, although it takes her a while to accept it. This is for the good, because if she decided that she would stay home in bed all day on Thursday she would end up in a car accident on Wednesday night and linger until the next day. Trying thwart a prophecy only makes things worse; just ask Jocasta and pay attention to how the prophecy in Sophocles' tragedy changes).

The first problem with this 2002 film is that it is a romantic comedy that takes itself too seriously one moment and not seriously enough the next. Feel good movies tend to have scenes where people burst into song, and we have that here. I like the song, but for that character to lead that group in that song at that particular moment is really not a good move (except that the people who wrote the script liked it, so it does work out for the best). People who are actually in the business of television news must be laughing themselves silly at all the stupid bits about their profession in this business; my favorite, but not in a good way, was this idea of showing an interview at 7 in the morning on the east coast live on the west coast.

Ultimately this film gets reduced to a simple platitude and it is at that point that ""Life or Something Like It"" really betrays its promise. What would have made this film really work is not that it works on a universal level to which we can all relate, but if it drives the point home in terms of Lanie's character in some memorable way. There are a few conventional and unimaginative efforts, but nothing that crystallizes into a transcendent scene that elevates this film to a truly meaningful level. Even if you do not see the ending coming, I doubt that you are going to be surprised that this film wants to have its cake and eat it too.

Jolie's character has trouble shedding her on-camera persona enough to provide true depth to an examination of her life that gets beyond her brave smile, which is different from her on-camera smile. Her romance with Burns is by the numbers and I found myself wishing the film had tried to do more with her relationship with boyfriend Cal Cooper (Christian Kane, an actor who is going to break through in films the way he did on television's ""Angel"" some day soon), who plays for the Seattle Mariners, because I actually liked his idea of how to try and help her and I thought there was the possibility there for something different. There will be those that really like this film, but even that minority should have no problem in articulating ways in which it could have been so much better.",1139097600,,3744,4.5586924219910845

1754011,2,B00006G8JD,"So I don't like Ed Burns (and this movie does very little to change my mind), and I have only recently begun to have a certain taste for Angelina Jolie. But I am a sucker for anything with Tony Shalhoub in it, even in a small but pivotal role he plays here. Shalhoub's versatility elevates almost any project with which he is associated from mediocrity to something a bit better. I found that to be the case here as well. What is an interesting concept is given a mediocre treatment. Lanie Kerrigan (a bleach blonde Jolie) is an up and coming Seattle tv reporter, perfectly primed for a plum network job (this is her ambition/dream). Teamed with cameraman Pete (Ed Burns), Lanie delivers standard reporting. One day she interviews a homeless ""prophet"" on the street (the excellent Shalhoub), who predicts various things that later come true. One of his predictions is that Lanie will die on a certain day in two weeks. Lanie comes to take his predictions seriously when all of the other predictions come true. Pete tries to calm Lanie down; Lanie has singlemindedly pursued her professional dreams at a high cost: she has completely lost touch with herself/who she is really. You get a hint of the ""Lanie inside"" in a scene in which she is unkempt, wearing her glasses, in front of her baseball player boyfriend, and he has no clue who she really is... and it seems she too has fallen out of touch with who she really is. In these self-conscious and introspective moments, when Lanie questions her identity (faced with the likelihood of her mortality), the movie hits a kind of peak. Unfortunately there is very little chemistry between Jolie and Burns, so their romantic spark lacks authenticity. However, though the ""get up"" (perfect make-up and ridiculous hairdo) is glossy and rather fake, Jolie imbues her role with a certain gravity that lends her character (and her going through the stages of denial and acceptance of her fate) believability. Unfortunately the film as a whole never quite hits its mark, and as a romantic comedy fails because it is not very funny and not very romantic. Jolie, though, does prove that she has much more versatility than I had previously given her credit for.",1111881600,,2199,4.774278215223097

1754023,5,B00006G8JD,"As you probably know, this movie has not always been well-received.  But, speaking as a die-hard fan of romantic comedies, I think those of you who love this genre should definitely watch this movie.
Most people who enjoy romantic comedies will probably admit that, though we love them, many of these movies have plot holes here and there, or at least admit that the likelihood of such things happening to real people is questionable.  So, with that already in mind, a viewer often falls in love with one of these movies because: a.) they love the actors, actresses, or director involved, and/or b.) the certainty that everything will probably turn out okay in the end (even if sometimes the movie's resolution is not what you'd expect).  If you fall into one/both of those categories, you should see LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT.
One of the reasons I think this movie is great is because Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns (as well as Tony Shalhoub, as the street prophet) are such great actors, and their banter and chemistry are highly watchable.  The supporting actors & actresses also add to each scene they're in, especially the guy playing the sound technician who works with Jolie's and Burns's characters when they are out on assignment.
I'm not someone who can tell when a movie is badly directed or superbly directed; I just know when I leave a movie happy for having seen it, or when I've felt the loopholes left in the finished product are way, way too big to ignore.  So, having warned you of my novice critical skill, I think the director did a great job.  (In his commentary on the DVD, he explains that this is one of the movies whose production was a bit rushed because of the expected actor's strike that the industry feared at the time.  So, I think he may wish he could have tweaked things here and there, if he'd had more time.)
Nonetheless, you should see this movie because it will still grab your heart and make you think about what is important in your own life, while still giving you that romantic comedy ""buzz"" that will put a smile on your face and joy in your heart.",1083024000,6,2091,4.574866310160428

Of additional note is the exceptional performance by Tony Shalhoub whose character provides much of the catalyst for this wonderful film.
One only needs to click on the link for director Stephen Herek to see that given his past films, this film should be a very good one.  He definitely deserves much praise for bringing this film together the way he did.
The Premise:
Lanie Kerrigan (Angelina Jolie) is an extremely ambitious and self absorbed local news reporter in Seattle whose star is rising and will soon have an opportunity to be elevated to the national level.  The only thing in her way is her boss's insistence that she must do some camera work with Pete (Edward Burns) who is a former lover and their relationship isn't exactly a great one.  As part of her work in Seattle, Pete takes her to meet Prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub) who is a street bum with the talents of a prophet, hence his name.  After she asks him whether she'll get the big job he tells that she won't because she's going to be dead on the following Thursday...
What follows from there is one of the best romantic comedies that I've watched in quite some time that is made that much better by Angelina Jolie's wonderful performance in the lead role!
I highly recommend this film to any and all that enjoys romantic comedies or just good movies in general!  {ssintrepid}

1754027,3,B00006G8JD,"This is yet another romantic comedy where all steps of the tale are crystal clear from stage 1. You know for sure who's gonna get the new job, who is going to be proven unworthy (of our heroine) and thrown away and who is going to end up in who's hands. Like all other movies of this kind all measures of regular logic are currently suspended. Are you not familiar with the scene where the heroine SUDDENLY realizes that her fiance/boyfriend, etc. is a real jerk? (where was she the whole time?) Or the scene where our heroine (who just the night before was busy doing other things such as getting drunk, having wild sex, etc.) is suddenly and without preparation knowledgeable of all facts needed for the new job, which she does with sincerity and in a way that leaves all with their mouth wide open?
One should also mention the making up scene between former rival family members and the part where an embarrassing failure (such as singing on live broadcast - best part of the movie) is considered a victory?
After all my criticism I can come down to the bottom line - all the above flaws I mentioned are known to this viewer, just like other viewers beforehand and all in all,  this is a really enjoyable movie of its kind.
So if you can overcome the shock of seeing the amazing Angelina Julie in a blond wavy hairstyle, looking as artificial as ever (""I am the only cameraman that can make you look like a natural blond"" says Pete in one of the best lines of the film) you are bound to enjoy this movie.",1072828800,,1507,4.382142857142857
1754028,4,B00006G8JD,"Angelina Jolie first caught my eye in the bubble-gum action of ""Tomb Raider"". I passed her off as a pop actress.
Then I happened to see ""Playing by heart"" and was utterly surprised by her acting caliber. And now in this otherwise strangely conceptual film, she creates another magical web in a near-Oscar performance as newswoman Lanie Kerigan. During the course of the movie, Lanie goes through the entire spectrum of emotions from joy, to fear, to anger, to sadness, to optimism, to anxiety...and Angelina captures them immaculately proving once again for me her fabulous versatility.
Theme-wise the movie is simplistic, it could easily have gone down a ""Wonderful Life"" kind of a touchy-feely drain, but it doesn't. The narrative develops engrossingly, and intelligently. I can't figure out why the ""general audience"" can't get into these movies more, movies that make you feel and think.
There are even humorous moments, supported well by Edward Burns who plays a cameraman-cum-friend, plus the somewhat doozy but never boring Tony Shalhoub as ""Prophet Jack.""
What could perhaps have made the movie a bit more clever and inspiring would be to have ended it about 10 minutes before it actually does. Most of its sweet, witty moments are lost in a pathetic denouement that moralizes that it is only heterosexual love and marriage (which includes taking your husband's name -- even though you have built a career, stock portfolio and life with yours) that can ultimately save a woman from herself. I can think of at least ten other ways to have ended the movie without messing up the smartness of the rest of the plot.
Yet, definitely a watchable movie. If you're like me it may even provoke some introspection. Recommended for a weekend rental.",1068854400,3,1746,4.982876712328767
1754029,5,B00006G8JD,"This has got to be one of the best movies Angelina Jolie has ever done. I held off on seeing this movie for a long time because I heard a lot of bad things about it but I have nothing negative to say. I thought the film was funny, charming and delightful. Angelina Jolie is wonderful in this film and really any film she's in. She can play dangerous Lady Croft or the Sandra Bullock type role in 'Life or Something Like It.' Fantastic movie.

1754030,5,B00006G8JD,"Angelina Jolie takes on the role of a news reporter who seems to have it all, until a homeless prophet played by Tony Shalhoub tells her that she will die within one week. She was very skeptical about his prediction -- until quite a few of his other predictions became true.

From the minute Jolie's character is delivered the gruesome news about her ""death,"" to the scene where she discovers the seer's earthquake prediction come true, we witness a vulnerability and frailty that is rarely seen in Angelina Jolie. It comes as something of a revelation, especially when seeing many of her other films.

From that moment, and on, she begins to undergo an evaluation of her life, and as a result, we see a vital transformation in her character throughout the rest of the movie. She also develops a poignant love connection with Edward Burns' character, which possibly may have been foreseen, as the two exhibited considerable sexual tension, along with the hilarious bickering swapped between them in the earlier parts of the film.

So, did Angelina Jolie's character die? Was the seer's prediction accurate? You'll just have to watch the film, as I refuse to give any of that away.

All in all, a light, poignant romantic comedy with considerable dramatic attributes. Once again, Angelina Jolie gives a rare performance, as there are many traces of vulnerability that are seldom seen in her other performances. Guest appearance from actress Stockard Channing.",1066348800,2,1458,4.987654320987654
1754031,4,B00006G8JD,"For newsreporter Lanie Kerrigan life is much like her platiunum blonde hair--perfect.  She thinks she has it all: smashing good looks, regular aerobics at a trendy gym, a famous ballplayer boyfriend, and a big paycheck.  Then one day, she meets a sidewalk seer who tells her that she will die within one week. Of course, she doesn't believe him, but when his other predictions come true, she thinks maybe this one will happen too.
Part of the charm of LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT is that director Stephen Herek takes us from a place that we think we know and want--our glitzy work life--and to a place that we dare not even contemplate--the sureness of the end of life and how we live just prior to the closing of the curtain.  Angelina Jolie is Lanie, in one of the most appealing roles of a surprisingly long career for such a young actress.  Lanie seems like the typical bland bubblehead that appears daily on our tv screens--all hair, all teeth, and not an original thought in that lovely but empty head.  But we soon enough find that beneath the glitter there is a woman who seeks more than what she thinks she wants, but doesn't yet know it.  She begins to see cracks in her life.  She has long had an ongoing dispute with her sister about whom their father always favored.  She recognizes that her baseball boyfriend's idea of conflict resolution is to take nightly batting practice.  She has tantalizing remorse about an affair with a co-worker (Edward Burns) that turned out badly but only because he did not fit in with her planned Big Scheme of Things.  Then this sidewalk seer Prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub) tells her that she will die next week.  All of a sudden, she has to regroup and reprioritize.  Prophet Jack makes it easy for her.  He tells her of the stages that she must pass through from denial to anger to acceptance.  Lanie goes through each, with each one forming a subplot to the movie.  The most revelatory step occurs on air when she breaks all the rules in a street corner interview with strikers by leading them in a rousing head-shaking rendition of the Stones' I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION.  Later, she passes through the final step in another on air interview with powerwoman Deborah (Stockard Channing) when she again deviates from the script in another attempt to secure journalistic integrity.
Yes, LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT is a puffed up piece of romantic fluff comedy but the interaction between Jolie, Burns, Shalhoub, and Channing are solid enough so that as Lanie passes through her prophetic stages to achieve inner calm, so do we.  When Lanie claims her prize of affirmation, again vicariously so do we.  Only the best kind of acting and directing can do this.",1062374400,5,2700,4.660337552742616
1754032,5,B00006G8JD,"I had seen Angelina Jolie in many a theatrical presentation be- fore, but I had honestly thought that this was her shining moment. I had loved the on screen relationship between she and Edward Burns. I don't own it yet, but when it goes on sale on VHS, I plan to be the first one in line to purchase it!",1058745600,,303,4.066666666666666
1754043,3,B00006G8JD,"As a result of seeing almost every movie made in the last five years I've been forced to accept that I am exceptionally tollerant as far as movies are concerned (I liked 'Josie and The Pussycats', 'Darkness Falls', and 'The Mothman Prophecies'). So when I think a movie is ""just ok"", I never argue if the rest of the world thinks its atrocious.
So I guess I'll start off by saying that I thought this movie was: Far-fetched, too long, boring in most parts, and badly acted (with the exception of Jolie, who I recognize is a big exception seeing as she's the star). With that in mind, you'll understand when I say I don't even want to know what a real film critic would have to say about this movie.
I gave it three stars because I like Jolie and (as I mentioned above) she was fine - if you can forgive for ever putting on that that blonde wig. But I would not classify this as a ""good movie"" or even say that I liked it.
For starters: Edward Burns cannot act. The guy is a joke. Maybe he is a decent director/writer/whatever else it is but whoever first let him in front of the camera should be shot.
And I won't even go into the amount of things that just didn't make sense about the plot, because in romantic comedies the script writer isn't supossed to have trouble tying up loose ends.
However, in retrospect the 'Life or Something Like It' was not entirely unenjoyable. I've already said I didn't exactly like it, however I didn't hate it either.
Who knows what it was, maybe Edward Burns can work his so called ""magic"" even on those who find him untalented and ugly, or maybe it was Jolie's performance that saved this potential trainwreck from being too horrible. I don't know, but my conclusion is its up to you. I didn't love it, but maybe you will.",1058227200,,1759,4.349544072948328

Everything in lanie's life is going great until she does an interview with a homeless man who claims to be a psychic, and he tells her she will die in a week. Now lanie questions the decisions she's made in her life, and tries to make peace with herself, and falls in love in the process.
This wasn't one of the greatest movies of all time or anything, but it was funny and cute...and above all it stars angelina jolie! With a PG-13 rating it's pretty much for the whole family as well.",1047081600,3,693,4.421875
1754045,5,B00006G8JD,"Angelina Jolie plays Lanie in ""Life or something like it"". Lanie is a reporter who does everything to get approval from people she thinks will make her career go high. She eventualy has to work with cameraman Pete (Edward Burns), with whom she has had an affair some time ago, but now they both can't stand each other. Then, during an interview with homeless Seattle prophet Jack (Tony Shalhoub), the prophet says, among other ... predictions, she has one week to live. After that, Lanie begins to think if her life was what she wanted it to be, and if her relations with people close to her (her family, co-workers and Pete) were right.
""Life or something like it"" 's script is nothing you havn't seen yet. It's predictable, even obvious. But I really liked the movie. Why?
1) The on-screen chemistry between Angelina and Burns worked very well;
2) The main trio (Angelina, Burns and Shalhoub) displayed intense and concentrated performances, giving credibility to a poor script;
3) Even if it's a silly story, I thought it very emotive (the actors and the director have important participation in turning a bad script into a nice movie);
4) Angelina jolie stays away from the obvious femme-fatale roles. Lanie still is a femme fatale, but a sweet one this time, not like the terrible character she performed in ""Original sin"".
I guess that's it. Watch this one, but don't think about the story too much, because there's not too much to think about.

1754046,2,B00006G8JD,"Angelina Jolie plays Lanie, a news reporter with her whole life laid before she. She has a nice job, a handsome jock for a boyfriend (Christian Kane), and it seems she just might get the job promotion of her dreams! No matter what anybody says, especially annoying cameraman Pete (Edward Burns), Lanie believes her life is perfect. Unfortunately, everything starts going haywire when she interviews a homeless calling himself 'Prophet Jack' (Tony Shalhoub). When Prophet Jack says that Lanie is going to die in a little less than a week, Lanie of course doesn't believe him. But when all of Jack's other 'future revelations' become true, Lanie begins to wonder if she really IS going to die!
*PLOT* - I must say that movie really had potential to become a great movie. It poses the question of 'what if you were going to die, what would you do'? Lanie's character in the movie starts to question her 'perfect life', including her relationship with her father, sister, and boyfriend. She starts to realize that she really hasn't lived her life to the fullest and begins to come out from her stiff ways. I thought that this part of the story was really interesting. Plus her relationship with Pete is so cute, though in the beginning they can't stand each other, you just KNOW that in the end they're going to fall in love. Unfortunately, some parts of Lanie and Pete's romance just doesn't seem to come together. Another bad point is that after maybe the first 30 minutes, the movie goes downhill after that. In the beginning my attention was kept on the screen and I was really interested to know what happens to Lanie. But as the story goes on, I came close to just not caring about the ending and just wanted the movie to finish. Plus the humor starts to diminish after maybe the first 30 minutes or so, making the movie feel dry.
*ACTING* - The acting is on the mediocre side, each actor and actress doing their part but not really giving the characters a chance to fully develop. In the beginning where Jolie and Burns have their bantering, I thought they delivered their lines very well.
*PG-13 RATING* - The movie is rated PG-13 for language and sexual content. I think that the romance between Jolie and Burns would have worked out better without any of the sexual content.
*OVERALL* - Overall, it's no wonder for me that the movie never really made it. Though it had the potential, the movie suffers from a stretched thin plot, not enough humor, and a bit of an unrealistic romance. I'd pass this movie on if I were you. But I can recommend this movie for die-hard Angelina Jolie fans since you'll get to see a lot of her. I give 2 stars for ""Life or Something Like It"" only because it had some potential and I thought the first part was funny and entertaining. Favorite line:
(Lanie and Pete talking to their boss)
Pete: Do you have another cameraman who can make her look like a natural blonde?
Lanie: My hair is my trademark. Just like the ""I don't like to shower"" look is your trademark.",1043539200,6,2999,4.565862708719852
1754047,3,B00006G8JD,"This had potential. Ed Burns comes up with good concepts and storylines and this movie had a promising plot. But I felt Angelina Jolie was miscast. Perhaps Meg Ryan would have worked here but I never quite bought the character with Jolie at the helm. The idea is Jolie is a driven newscaster who wants to make up for a childhood lived in her sister's shadow (or at least I think that was the point - unfortunately, this is never well defined or clear). She's on the brink of getting her big break when a homeless guy/prophet tells her she's going to die in a week. Most of the movie is thus about how Jolie's character comes to grips with the life she is living (shallow, materialistic, selfish) and the life she supposedly should be living (spontanious and sexual?). Of course, the ending is happy and predictable.",1042675200,2,815,4.551020408163265

I'll leave the plot summaries to others. It is a contrived plot, hoping to capture a little of the It's A Wonderful Life magic that turns contrivances into classics. But it didn't. Predictable. Well, can anyone imagine the boy and girl who argue upon meeting won't be sleeping together within 50 minutes? And will she die? Gee...I wonder.
But more irritating than its silly plot is its mashing of every cliche and contemporary feel-good mindless mantra into one story. It's as if the author read Redbook, Psychology Today, and Vogue to see what the people are thinking, and managed to get a plot that encompassed all these. There is not one real idea in here; it is just recycled new age pap. Live for today. Follow your heart. Be authentic. Of course, when you're gorgeous and rich, it is a lot easier. And when you can fall back on being a major media star after rejecting your dream job, well, what a sacrifice. Snoooze........",1042070400,,1151,4.565217391304348
1754049,1,B00006G8JD,"If ""Life or Something Like It"" doesn't offend your sensibilities as a film-goer, it will offend the great, long-standing Hollywood tradition of romantic comedies.  As wonderful as Angelina Jolie's screen presence might be, and as likeable as this movie should be, it's a dreaded piece of claptrap that assumes that the audience is just like its selfish, boorish, philosophically near-sighted main character, who doesn't realize that you should live each day as if it is your last.  Well, for one, who hasn't heard that phrase one million times already?  Two, sure you should live a meaningful life, but the message is misguided: if I lived every day as if it were my last, I would quit my job, get a beach chair, and sit on a beach in Maui while a bevy of supermodels poured me Mai Tais.  The problem is that I, and no one else, can really do that.  But more important is the fact that this film would have worked if it had delivered that message without having to explain it in such an obvious, insult-your-intelligence kind of way.
This film, of course, requires a willing suspension of disbelief.  Jolie's Lanie Kerrigan has been selfish and materialistic her whole life, but in just a few days she changes her entire world view and life style because a bum on the street says she has a week to live.  OK, so let's assume you can accept the premise of the film, which is interesting in and of itself, but then you have to put up with Ed Burns's character constantly reminding you to stop and smell the roses and with Jolie's strained attempt to reconcile relationships and find what matters -- and all this happens without any sense of magic or wonderment or even soul-enriching humor.  It's all paint-by-numbers.  Woman and man hate each other.  Woman and man fall in love.  Man loses woman.  Man regains woman.  Happy ending.  Yawn.
OK, ok. Sometimes the formula can work (although it doesn't in this film).  But under no circumstances could I ever believe that a local tv reporter, even with a major-league baseball boyfriend, would ever be living in the kind of high-end apartment with the interior design that Kerrigan does in this film.  Even if her baseball boyfriend could afford it, it wouldn't look like that. That small detail is a microcosm of the entire film: meaning it's as well thought out as a generic romance novel.

Then in the second half it becomes to mushy and because a chick flick. That's not the case with this movie Life or Something Like It. Life or Something Like It starts off funny and in the second half is both. It's a regular second half except they stick in alot of comendy. This movie is also very likable because it sticks a drama bit inside it too. hat's three genre's that are kept at a good pace spread out during the movie. That to me is an outstanding achievement. Keeping the genre that the movie was assigned as could be rough but this movie kept three genre's running which is difficult.
The movie stars Angelina Jolie who was never my favorite actress. Her worst movie I thought was Lara Croft Tomb Raider. This she makes up for that even though she shouldn't have made her hair blonde. Her co-star is Edward Burns which was a new actor to me. I want to see his other movie Sidewalks of New York because of the ranting reveiws but never got to that. But Burns is the reason that I gave the movie four stars. I thought that his acting was weak and his display of character didn't show as much as Jolie's acting. Stockard Channing is another co-star is the movie. I was never crazy about her and I also thought her preformace was weak. The best actor of the whole movie had to be Tony Shalob who is always a great actor. Shalob is known for his fame in Monk,Spy Kids,and an episode of Frasier earlier in the 90's.
The movie is about Lanni Kerrigan(Angelina Jolie)who is a TV reporter for a station in Seattle. She's trying to get a promotion to play a co-host on a talk show called AM U.S.A. To prepare her for that her boss makes her work with Pete(Edward Burns)who is a cameraman. Lannie and Pete don't get along well because of her thoughts about herself and his comments. Lannie is engaged to Cal who is her live in boyfriend and also a baseball player. Lannie's father Pat is also in the movie who Lannie thinks favors her married sister Gwen. Pete and Lannie get assigned to do a story on Prophet Jack(Tony Shalob) who is a street steer who is known for his on the money predictions. Jack informs Lannie that in one week she is going to die. Lannie doesn't believe him untill all of his other preiditons come true. Lannie tries to find out if Jack was right about her death. Pete suggests that mabey she should start to act differtly and instead of following rules and orders try to have a little fun in life. From then the quest begins to change Lannie's future with the help of Pete along the way.

Although she has done comedy before, she has never been in a romantic comedy before, and I hope that this won't be her last.  She is easily one of the most beautiful women in the world, but what makes her especially delightful is her charismatic onscreen personality, and that devastating smile, framed by the most amazing mouth this side of Michelle Pfeiffer.
Angelina and Ed Burns make an appealing couple, and they project good onscreen chemistry.  You like them as a couple, and pull for them to somehow manage to get together.  Tony Shaloub is one of the more versatile character actors in Hollywood today, and he is excellent in his smallish but crucial role of Prophet Jack.
The film is also gorgeous to look at, and not just when Angelina is the focus.  The film is marvelously photographed from beginning to end, and if sometimes the shots serve less to further the story than to create attractive images, one can't complain that it isn't successful at that.
The only weakness in the film is the fact that the plot is too predictable.  It also feels way too familiar from first to last.  It is not a film that will blow anyone away with its originality, but it will still delight all but the most hardhearted of viewers for a couple of pleasant hours.",1035936000,2,1452,4.583011583011583
1754071,3,B00006G8JD,"An interesting concept, though more conducive to late night coffee house musings and discussions than a feature length film treatment, provides a pleasant, if less than insightful vehicle for it's star, in ""Life or Something Like It,"" directed by Stephen Herek, wherein the oft reflected upon question, ""What would you do if you found out you had only a week to live?"" becomes a showcase for the beautiful and talented Angelina Jolie, albeit a rather vapid and shallow one.  Still, it gets the job done, inasmuch as it is entertaining (to a point), has one interesting (though underused) character and will give die-hard Jolie fans, especially, something to revel in.  The problem is that the late night ruminations the filmmakers begin about the meaning of life end long before the store closes, and anything ""meaningful"" that may have come of it is left on the table for another time and another movie.  Suffice to say, this isn't Bergman; but then again, it wasn't meant to be.
Lanie Kerigan (Jolie) is a field reporter for a local television station in Seattle, a ""personality"" of the affiliate's news team, covering human interest stories and events in and around the Emerald City.  She's engaged to Cal Cooper (Christian Kane), who plays ball for the Seattle Mariners, and all in all her life is nearly perfect.  And it will be ""absolutely"" perfect if she lands the job she's just learned she's up for:  A spot on the network's prestigious morning show, which originates from New York and is broadcast nationally.  Yes, for Lanie, except for being teamed with an incorrigible (in her estimation) cameraman, Pete (Edward Burns), life is good.  With her very next assignment, however, all of that is going to change.
His name is Jack (Tony Shalhoub); he's a homeless, self-professed ""prophet"" who lives in a makeshift cardboard box and is given to ""visions"" which enable him to predict such things as the score of the next Sea Hawks game, or if it is, in fact, going to hail in the morning, regardless of the weatherman's forecast.  He's a colorful character, just right for a ""Lanie"" segment; but even before the actual interview begins, Jack tells Lanie two things:  1.) She's not going to get that job she so desperately wants, and 2.) come next Thursday (one week away) she is going to die.  And just like that Lanie's life isn't so perfect anymore.  She's about to take that long walk on a short pier...
To whip up this repast for his audience, director Herek manages to crack the egg and get it in the skillet, but he forgot to turn on the burner, so it never cooks; it just kind of lays there in the pan.  It looks good, but how many people enjoy raw eggs?  The screenplay (by John Scott Shepherd and Dana Stevens) lacks originality to begin with, and Herek shows little imagination in his handling of the story and the characters, so it never really comes to life, despite the efforts of Jolie.  And from the information we're given, or even from what is implied about the relationship (past and present) between Lanie and Pete, the ""romance""-- such as it is-- just doesn't fly, even within the parameters of ""romantic comedy"" (Is THAT what this is?).  The biggest problem with the film, though, is that it fails to connect you emotionally with any of the characters; these just aren't people you care enough about to make it involving or maintain interest.  Add to that the fact that, even though this is light fare, it simply lacks the credibility necessary to make it work.  In the end, the audience would have been better served had Herek thrown in a couple more ""yokes.""
The film suffers something of an identity crisis, and gets caught up in a dilemma of it's own making; just what is it trying to be?  A romantic comedy?  If so, it fails.  Or is it striving to be a satirical exploration of a question perhaps too profound for the genre in which Herek is apparently working?  In which case it also fails.  It would have been much better for all concerned had the focus been on the relationship between Lanie and Jack the prophet, as THIS is where the real interest of the story lies.  The myriad possibilities this afforded remained untapped, however, as the filmmakers opted for another route which, unfortunately, never made it to the Promised Land.
As far as showcasing Jolie, it does; but that is not to say that it presents her in the best possible light, the fault of which lies entirely with the inherent nature of the character.  Lanie is just too career minded and self-absorbed to be a thoroughly engaging ""personality,"" and it dulls the sparkle of what could have been.  Even her ""epiphany"" is not enough to make her star shine in this role.  As Lanie, Jolie looks the part; she's beautiful, even alluring.  But with this particular character, she seems to lose that edge, that intensity, that sparks her usual charismatic screen presence, which is absent here, as well.  So even though this film is essentially a ""showcase"" for Jolie, it simply does not do her justice.
As for Edward Burns, can he dance?  Because if they ever make ""The Gene Kelly Story,"" this is the guy.  It's the timbre of his voice, so reminiscent of Kelly's (but it CAN be grating after awhile).  Burns is a good actor, and he gives a solid performance here, but his character, Pete, even after his ""personal"" story comes to light, just isn't that interesting.
The saving grace of the entire film is Tony Shalhoub's portrayal of Jack, a character that will capture your imagination.  The trouble is, you don't see enough of him, and it's a dreadful waste of a potentially great character and storyline; a dreadful waste of the magic that could have made ""Life or Something Like It"" a film to remember.",1035417600,,5704,4.700502512562814
1754072,3,B00006G8JD,"When an young attractive hard-working reporter named Lanie Kerigan (Angelina Jolie) has everything in her life with an great job for an television network in the city of Seattle and she's soon to be married with an professional baseball player (Christian Kane). When her network boss (Gregory Itzin) gives her a chance to work on a major and professional work as a reporter in New York but Lanie's boss makes a deal with her, working with a cameraman (Edward Burns), which she dislike him, because they had a relationship before. But her life is about to change, when an strange homeless man, who seems to be a Prophet (Tony Shalhoub) named Jack. When Jack sees and tell Laine's future, telling her, she has a week to live. She becomes frighten by that, she decides to change her attitude towards herself and people, including her family, she barely keeps in touch with.
Directed by Stephen Herek (Critters, Mr. Holland's Opus, Rock Star) makes this very flawed film watchable, thanks to Jolie's (If Miscast) winning performance, which seems to be aberrant role for her. Burns is likable in this also. But it's John Scott Shepherd (Joe Somebody) and Dana Stevens (City of Angels) Screenplay is unconvincing and unbelievable from Shepheard's Story but it's a nice try, though. There's some touching and funny moments in this but not nearly enough of. Some of it's pretty fresh in it and worth seeing once, at least. DVD's has an anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD only extra is the Director's Commentary in this Box Office disappointment.

1754073,5,B00006G8JD,"This is one of my favourite movies. Yes boys and girls, I think that Angelina Jolie out does herself, even more than her role as the great Laura Croft. I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and this movie made me realize that everyday is a blessing make the most of it, have fun because you will never get out of of it alive anyway. Most of the stuff in life is small stuff and this movie shows where priorities lie. Edward Burns is an incredible actor and does and outstanding job as a love interest, and he shows the main character to lighten up. Remember, ""Live everyday as though it is your last, for one day it will be"". I hope this movie will mean as much to others as it did to me. Thank you, Ms. Jolie, Mr. Burns and Mr. Herek.

1754084,5,B00006G8JD,"First start, JOLIE plays a very ""in your face""-gorgeous-looking TV personality (with the platinum blonde and obvious super [word] physical attributes - JOLIE's trademark). That alone might just an eye-candy factor. But then Ms Brilliant JOLIE didn't just deliver vanilla ""eye-candiness"". Her razor sharp remarks and sarcastic humor is what really brings the movie alive. One of my favourites is, ""OH GOD, YOU ARE TRYING TO HAVE[word]WITH ME!"" Who else DARE and QUALIFY for the Line??? (I love that clip so much that I replayed it again and again with lots of heart-felt giggles). The screenplay projects a sense of exploration into human existense's ""meaningness"". It really hits home for me but then I admit I might not have the courage like Lanie in the movie to run out of ""it"" and ""reborn"" again. Unless, of cause, a super goregous ED BURNS is waiting for me. Haha! :D  BTW, ED BURNS really doen't look like acting at all. What a pleasure to see him flirting with Lanie! Super natural and fluid acting chops here for Mr. Burns. I think this film is simply generally-underated by many ""superficial"" film critics just because a what appears to be a ""big blonde hair with big lips"" character is present in the film. To be fair, this is to me more like ""Space Odyessy 2001"" than your standard ""hollywood romantic comedy"" production. JOLIE AND BURNS definiely know what they are doing when they signed on. Last but not least, to JOLIE: I genuinely like you as a human being. Self-acceptance includes the courage to accept one's own talents and good looks, too(I can proudly say I am working on it). Brilliant people tends to be a bit different and it's always very OKAY to live life with the theme of FUN, Adventure, Self-acceptance and a heart for others(only to those who deserve it though, be discerning on that one).

1754086,4,B00006G8JD,"I, like many, went to the movie based soley on one reason: To see Christian Kane shine. In the movie, he plays Cal Cooper, Lanie's VERY handsome, yet VERY shallow Seattle Mariners Fiance. Just like Imzadi mentioned in her review, even though Chris had top-billing behind Jolie, Burns and Shalhoub, he STILL hardly got the recognition he deserved. Even though the scenes he was in were small (only about 2-5 minutes long, 10 at most), he delivered some pretty funny, if not memorable lines (for example, when Lanie explains how she met a homeless guy, and he had a vision, Cal asks if he had ""ESPN""). Also, like she mentioned, Chris was able to slip into the film a few bars from ""Sweet Carolina Rain"", a song by his country-rock band, Kane. Still, no recognition, despite being a part of some prominant moments in the film. At least in movies like Louis L'Amour's ""Crossfire Trail"" and MTV's ""Love Song"", he got some recognition, and of course, who could forget his role as the Morally-challenged Lindsey McDonald on the WB's ""Angel""? Hopefully, in next year's ""Just Married"" (with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy), he'll get noticed when he raises a little kane...",1027728000,3,1168,4.8159203980099505
1754087,3,B00006G8JD,"I went to see this movie for one reason and one reason only: I had hoped that this would be Christian Kane's big break.  The reason I'm writing this review is that no one else has even mentioned him, in spite of his fourth billing behind Jolie, Burns, and Shaloub.  He was certainly handsome enough and did a good job in the scenes in which he appeared (I understand a kissing scene had been cut), and he even got to sing a few bars of one of his band Kane's songs, Sweet Carolina Rain, but it didn't do as much for him as he and his fans hoped, unfortunately.  Evidently the best showcase for Christian's talents is still the television series Angel, in which he played the morally ambiguous lawyer Lindsey McDonald for 15 episodes in the first and second seasons.  Chris has the looks and the talent; he just needs a bigger part in a better movie.  Check him out in the made-for-television movies Crossfire Trail (available on DVD & VHS) and Love Song (coming out on VHS).",1025049600,,974,4.418994413407821
1754088,5,B00006G8JD,"First of all, I've been her biggest fan for 4 years and I can be very honest when it comes to her films. If this movie was rated on a scale of 1 to 10, I would just give this feature 5 stars. The exact reason being is because the story line had heart yet lacked focus on the real meaning on the technicality of the movie.  The reason anyone would watch this movie is the fact that Angelina Jolie is the key figure that we all centralize our focus unto, but then again, I will watch any movie she makes.  Although the story lacked so many interesting viewpoints the story reluctantly pulled through.  This movie may not have been a ""Gia"" or ""Girl,Interrupted"", but it delivers a presence in miss Angelina Jolie to rout for the protaganist and charm yourself for the descent looking Edward Burns.  I only hope that my opinion can count for some kind of say in the ever changing world of hollywood.",1024876800,2,895,4.341317365269461
1754089,1,B00006G8JD,"This movie was absolutely horrible. It was the biggest waste of time in my life. I would have walked out if I wasn't with other people.
  The screenplay was terrible, characters were not fully explained enough to understand why they did the things they were doing. All we knew is that they had to do that to fit into the romantic comedy cliches. Or when things were explained like Jolie's character being overly concerned with appearances, we were beat over the head with over and over. After just a few minutes of the movie, everything that happened became cringe-inducing, by either it's ridiculous set-up or the fact that it's happened 100X better a hundred times in other movies.
  Another thing about this movie was it's outdated views in which a woman cannot have a meaningful relationship and an meaningful work life at the same time.
  But the worst part about this film was the few times it was pretending it was an art film by using irrelevant and 'artistic' point of view shots. The pov shots said nothing about the characters, they were pointless. Don't see this movie.",1023580800,4,1081,4.723404255319149
1754090,4,B00006G8JD,"The best way that I feel I can describe this movie is this: I liked it, but I'm not exactly sure how much.  There are several reasons why I liked the movie but not a lot of reasons to make me think it's one of the best ever made.  First off, any fan of Angelina Jolie shouldn't think twice about seeing this movie.  She continues to prove time and again what a versatile actress she is.  And if anyone else had played her role, this movie would have come across extremely boring.  The rest of the cast was well chosen but they definitely weren't enough to carry the movie by themselves.  The addition of Stockard Channing was a very fitting one as she did an excellent job of playing the network news equivalent of Jenny Jones meets Barbara Walters.  And Edward Burns does an adequate job of playing Jolie's cameraman and part time love interest.
The story itself had a lot of interesting elements to it.  Angelina Jolie plays Lannie Kerrigan, a Seattle Reporter who is living the perfect life, or at least what she thinks is the perfect life.  She has the perfect body, the perfect hair, a major league baseball player as her fiance, and is one step away from her perfect network news anchor job in New York City.  Everything is running according to plan, when one day, while on assignment she is given some life altering news.  A street prophet tells her that in one week she will die.  At first she dismisses his prophecy as nothing to be taken seriously, but as his other predictions come true, her perfect world starts to unravel.  She is forced to look at every aspect of her life and realizes that everything she thought was so important doesn't really matter.  What follows is a mixture of sometimes funny and at times depressing series of events that teach her the true meaning of what a perfect life really is.

All in all a solid movie to go and see.  The performances were all done very well, with Angelina Jolie being the bright spot in the whole movie.  There were several memorable scenes, including the impromptu singing of  ""Satisfaction"" during a bus driver strike.  This movie was definitely a feel good comedy from start to finish, with a few sad parts that were necessary to bring the viewer back up.  And my personal favorite scene was Jolie and her fiance taking batting practice.  It just really cracked me up.  This isn't a movie you have to see in theatre's by any means, but would be well worth the rental price sometime for a date night at home.
The Breakdown:
1.  Plot-8 (neat structure for a romantic comedy)
2.  Characters-8 (very detailed and well developed)
3.  Flow-9 (moved along quite nicely)
4.  Atmosphere-9 (you can tell a lot of thought went into the setup)
5.  Cinematography-8 (not a lot of creativity but didn't look low budget either)
6.  Entertainment value-9 (surprisingly attention grabbing for such a simple plot)
7.  Replay Value-7 (not a movie I could watch all the time but not necessarily one I would turn off either)
8.  Casting/character depth-9 (Great casting for the most part and excellent detail to characters)
9.  Relevance to genre-8 (hard to categorize but a good all around movie)
10. X-factors-8 (Angelina Jolie alone makes this movie worth seeing)

This is a very cleverly done film, because it's somewhat satirical but not as deep as it could have been.  Journalism is shown to be a profession of drones who smile on cue and say what they are told to say.  Beneath the surface of that persona shown on TV lies some of the most miserable people.  The movie demonstrates that there are people in journalism worse off emotionally than homeless bums.  The segment in the film with the people singing ""I can't get no Satisfaction"" was brilliant.
