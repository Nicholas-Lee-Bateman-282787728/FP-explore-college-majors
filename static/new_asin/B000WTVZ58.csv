8619823,3,B000WTVZ58,"This video is okay.  There is no story, just an assemblage of short clips of people dancing or playing instruments or kids coloring, etc., which was fine.  My 3 year old thought those parts of it were interesting, but other parts of the video confused her (and me!)  There is a girl who plays the harp (interesting), but the final scene of the movie is her playing the harp inside a fishtank (odd).  It is mainly these scenes where the film's directors got carried away with special effects that we didn't like.  There is one scene where a baby is playing with a shaker.  Cute...but the directors superimposed this image overtop of a busy highway, which alarmed my daughter.  (""Why is the baby in the road?  He'll get hurt!"")  My only other reservation about this movie that that only one of the people demonstrating talents/skills was non-white.  There are a smattering of kids of color, but I want my daughter to see that everyone can participate in art, music, and dance, not only white people.",1379289600,,997,4.645714285714286
8619824,5,B000WTVZ58,"This video contains imagery and sounds that all children should be exposed to at an early age.  Each scene masterfully blends into the next.  It kept my child's attention throughout. Unlike the Baby Einstein series, this video mixes both real life visuals and fantasy visuals.  I play this tape for my 7 month old son every day.  He watches and waits for his favorite parts.  Then when the parts are shown, he laughs and moves his arms about.  It is an amazing thing to see.  This product would also be excellent for older childen as well.  A great product.  Thank you.",1023148800,,569,4.554455445544554
