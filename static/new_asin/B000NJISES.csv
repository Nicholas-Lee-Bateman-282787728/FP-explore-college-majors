8178289,5,B000NJISES,My little guy ohhs and ahh over the highlight clips.  I love sharing my love of the red sox with my little man!!,1315872000,,112,3.869565217391304
8178290,4,B000NJISES,My 4 month old loved it and so did his dad!  They can watch it together and root for their favorite team.,1207785600,,105,3.772727272727273
8178291,3,B000NJISES,"I thought this movie would be a little more about baseball. It models a lot of the Baby Eienstien videos and shows colors and sounds that you would find at Fenway Park and shows babies and toddlers playing in Red Sox clothes. My son is two and gets bored with it very quickly, maybe it is Ben Affleck's voice which is very melodramatic the whole time, but it was entertaing only the first time he watched it.",1201910400,2,408,4.311688311688312
8178292,3,B000NJISES,"Let me start by saying that I am not only a lifelong Red Sox fan, but also a third generation fan.  I got this dvd for my nephews hoping to share that love since they live several thousand miles from Fenway.  As far as baby/toddler videos go, it's not all that exciting.  My older nephew felt there was neither enough singing nor enough animals...  And, he was REALLY disappointed that the big green monster wasn't an actual monter.  (I guess he was expecting a relative of Elmo's?)",1180915200,4,482,4.494252873563219
8178293,1,B000NJISES,"Haven't watched it, bought it for 3 grandsons but........why is there a large photo of a  boy on the front and a small token photo of a girl on the back? Not good marketing.",1178841600,3,173,4.088235294117647
8178294,5,B000NJISES,"Only people who have actually viewed and/or purchased this item should be allowed to review it.  Amazon should really watch their customers reviews and I'm sure the product manufacturer and other retailers feel the same way.  It just goes to show that Yankee fans are of a different class, and I don't mean that in a good way.  I guess that's why they call it ""Friendly Fenway"" and the only good comments about the Bronx pertain to the Zoo.",1177804800,4,440,4.544303797468355
