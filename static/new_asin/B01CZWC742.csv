8754459,2,B01CZWC742,"Ashamed that people even made this depressing tale of the boy who killed a Beatle. Why is more of a decent question,why did anyone sign on to be in this lurid tale? Acting not cool sets not cool, story WAY NOT COOL!!!",1525478400,,217,4.190476190476191
8754460,3,B01CZWC742,"Mediocre portrait of Mark Chapman and an exploration of his life and motivations for killing John Lennon. His mental health conditions are discussed, with the usual 'narcissistic personality' card being played (an easy way out for less experienced clinicians). The man hallucinated, heard voices, and had delusions of grandeur; those are not features of a narcissist. He was clearly psychotic in addition to having a personality disorder. But don't mind me, let a journalist without any clinical training tell you (Jack Jones).

Hearing Chapman in his own words was interesting, though he is self-absorbed and shows little empathy for others in his world. The movie 'Chapter 27' with Jared Leto is a fairly good re-enactment of what happened, if one is so inclined. Chapman's punishment was deserved, but I can't help but think that Hinkley (who almost killed President Reagan) has been released and living in the community for over a year now. And he was far more dangerous that Chapman. Perhaps the judge and jury were Lennon fans. Shrug.",1517961600,,1040,5.117647058823529
8754461,1,B01CZWC742,"thank goodness it was short i almost turned it off but not doing anything, raining outside i made it thru. horrible piece of crap shows exactly why the mentailly ill and guns don't mix.",1513900800,,185,4.470588235294118
8754462,4,B01CZWC742,"I agree that it's too short (as BBC docs tend to be), but a good insight on the sick narcissism behind the senseless act. As for the nonsense 1 star review left by someone WHO DIDN'T EVEN WATCH THIS, here's an extra star to balance the trolls.",1505865600,,243,4.191489361702128
8754463,3,B01CZWC742,"This is a fairly decent (if a bit short) documentary on Mark David Chapman, drawing both from private interviews with Chapman as well as other factual evidence.  The Chapman tapes play a small roll in this piece.  I have seen better docs on the topic, but this one flowed well and it did give an interesting perspective on the event.  I think the person who gave a 1 star review while stating that they ""will never watch it"" shouldn't comment on videos they have not and do not intend to watch simply to disparage the topic.  I did find the film a bit short and would have been better as a segment in a more complete doc.",1501027200,,621,4.282051282051282
8754464,1,B01CZWC742,I hate that this film exists and I will never watch it. Please do not give this person what he desired most: attention. He robbed us of a great soul. I recommend A Hard Day's Night instead.,1470787200,10,189,4.135135135135135
