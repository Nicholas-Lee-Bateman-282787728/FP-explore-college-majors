6397289,2,B00JZL5BEK,"Awesome movies, but the problem is; I ordered a box set and was expecting a box set. I received two separate, and broken, individual cases. If I had known I was going to get that; I'd have got to Wal-Mart and gotten the two there for $20 less or gotten the box set for $10 less. Not exactly satisfied with this purchase. At least the movies played though",1422835200,25,354,4.220588235294118

6397295,3,B00JZL5BEK,"I don't believe this box set is accurately priced for what you get. You get exactly what you see, just two blu-Ray DVDs. No regular DVD or bonus discs. Which is fine but had I known I would've payed for the individual ones and gotten more for my money. However, if the DVDs alone are what you seek then this is perfect. Movies showed in mint condition shape and well packaged. Showed up on time.",1467763200,,395,4.28

6397299,5,B00JZL5BEK,"Although somewhat late on my review, I would like to say, These 2 Movies have made me a Die Hard Fan of Captain America. They remind me of the 40s serials and the time period of the 'First Avenger more so"".  The Modern Day Technology of the ""Winter Solider is absolutely fantastic. For action movies I rate them along with Batman & Superman Movies, If Not some what higher for Superman.. 2 Great Superhero Action Not to be missed""""""",1459123200,,432,4.468354430379747
6397300,5,B00JZL5BEK,"Great Si Fi and super hero stuff.  Chris Evans is wonderful
as Captain America.  Can't wait for the third installment.
You may want to wait for the Trilogy box set.  May be worth
the wait. Too late for me.",1458777600,2,205,4.205128205128205

6397306,5,B00JZL5BEK,"More Captain for your money! Not one adventure, but two. If you haven't seen the first adventure, then this is definitely the one for you. If you have seen the first, then you may want to watch it once again, so you can catch something you may have missed, to be prepared for the second movie, and then relax- Captain America, at his best!",1454716800,3,339,4.3125
6397307,5,B00JZL5BEK,Recieved and love the movie,1453852800,,27,4.6
6397308,5,B00JZL5BEK,"We purposely wait for the boxed sets to come out now because for the amount of money that you spend on them separately,  equals the cost of a boxed set. Captain America is my favorite character so naturally,  I'm a little biased here. I enjoyed the first one & the sequel equally which is rare because normally,  I find the sequels disappointing. Both are clean, action packed & the characters maintain equal integrity in both movies. You will definitely be watching from beginning to end.",1453680000,,489,4.729411764705882

6397311,1,B00JZL5BEK,do not order this if you live in the usa. They ship you british dvds set for region 2 coding. USA's region code is region 1 so you're unable to watch the movies if you have a standard dvd player,1451520000,20,194,3.875
6397312,5,B00JZL5BEK,"Yep, right up there with my other Marvel movies. Everything is as promised. I watch them often. Excellent product condition.",1449705600,,124,5.25
6397313,5,B00JZL5BEK,"Marvel had a considerable obstacle when they decided to add Captain America to their roster. He's a patriotic superhero, but he needs to not feel jingoistic or alienate people from other countries. He's a pure-hearted warrior, but needs to not feel self-righteous or boring.

Yet Marvel managed to explore this character in the best way possible, in the loosely-linked ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" While these movies are wildly different stories -- one is a period war movie, the other a contemporary political thriller -- they are held together by Chris Evans' powerful performance as the titular character, and a strong supporting cast that make Captain America able to take on the most malevolent foes.

The time: World War II, with the Nazi science division HYDRA menacing the allies. Scrawny asthmatic Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) desperately wants to defend his country, but he's too puny to enter the army. Dr. Abraham Erskine sees the goodness and courage in Steve's heart, and enlists him in a top-secret experiment to create a super-soldier. Within minutes, Steve has superhuman strength, speed and big shiny muscles.

Unfortunately, the army seems more interested in using the superpowered Captain America as a mascot than a fighter. Are you really surprised? This is the GOVERNMENT we're talking about. When Steve learns that his best buddy has been captured by the Nazis, he singlehandedly invades an enemy base and rescues dozens of soldiers. But this brings him to the attention of the Nazi super-science division Hydra, and its malevolent leader Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) -- who is the only other man as strong as Captain America.

Fast forward to 2014. In ""Winter Soldier,"" Steve is still struggling to adapt to modern life, especially since his old friends are mostly dead. He's also working for SHIELD, but increasingly becoming disenchanted with Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) secretive way of doing things -- until Jackson is attacked by a bunch of mysterious terrorists, and then is gunned down by the mysterious Winter Soldier. Before he dies, he gives a flash drive to Steve, and tells him not to trust anyone.

And he soon finds out why -- after Steve lies about having the drive, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) brands him a traitor and sends the full force of SHIELD after him, except for Natasha (Scarlett Johansson), who wants to know who killed Fury. But keeping uncovering the information on the drive is just the first step as Captain America discovers a horrifying secret inside the very structure of SHIELD -- and the true identity of the Winter Soldier.

The first two Captain America movies are pretty much a perfect example of why Marvel's movies are taking over the world. This is a story about a guy who wears American-flag body armor and fights a Nazi with a bright-red skull-face, before getting frozen in a glacier that somehow keeps him alive for seventy years. It sounds utterly silly... yet it's handled with the right mixture of tongue-in-cheek humor and steely-eyed earnestness.

Admittedly the two movies are wildly different -- ""First Avenger"" is steeped in the retro sensibilities of the 1940s, from the Nazi villains to the riveted pale-green chamber that transforms Rogers with magical plot radiation. But it adds a more worldly spin to the Captain's image -- not only does he start out as a patriotic mascot, but when he starts battling HYDRA, he needs the help of a multi-racial, multinational band of friends who each bring their own talents to the battle. It's not one man against the bad guys, but a pure-hearted leader who can bring a team to greatness.

On the other hand, ""Winter Soldier"" is a darker, more modern movie that taps into our fears about surveillance, violated rights and fascist government divisions. While Captain America had to fight his country's enemies before, he now has to fight the enemies that have embedded themselves in the country, like malevolent ticks sucking away personal freedoms. It's a tight, suspenseful movie with some truly shocking twists, and balances out the thriller with a personal tale -- it involves the discovery of the Winter Soldier's identity, and Steve's desperate attempts to reach out to him.

And a lot of the movie's believability comes from Chris Evans. He plays Steve Rogers as the kind of guy that everyone looks up to -- he's brave, intelligent, incorruptible, earnest... and yet he's also pleasantly awkward and sweet. And whatever era he's in, Cap needs a ""band of brothers"" to support him, starting with his best friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) and continuing with the robot-winged Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). And the cast is nicely rounded out with Johansson and Jackson, who play more shades-of-grey, do-what-needs-to-be-done characters.

""Captain America: 2 Movie Collection"" brings together the two first movies about everyone's favorite star-spangled supersoldier -- one is an earnest retro-styled adventure movie, and the other is a darker, more intense political thriller. At the center of both, like a lighthouse, is Captain America.",1449619200,7,5115,5.122302158273381
