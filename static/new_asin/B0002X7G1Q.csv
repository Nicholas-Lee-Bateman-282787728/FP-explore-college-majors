Now every weekend, they are watching the video and enjoying as if it was the first time they saw it.",1258416000,,267,4.056603773584905
2131710,5,B0002X7G1Q,"This was great the ending episodes and other episodes. the ending episodes show that in the end people get theirs, good or bad. and i love that it showed that rich and popular people won't always be that way. life changes and friends come and go. but the real ones stay in touch or stay in your life. it was really good i recommend it to others. As Told By Ginger is a great show. and this dvd is a good one.",1197417600,,408,3.9878048780487805
2131711,5,B0002X7G1Q,"First-off, I ended up finding this early (since it's not supposed to be out til tomorrow).

 Just some quick notes:  It's a good movie, and a nice way to end the series.",1101081600,10,169,4.21875
2131722,5,B0002X7G1Q,Looked absolutely amazing on my 4k and the story ended so well! That last scene was so awsome. This is 90s tv at its best!,1453248000,,122,3.92
2131723,5,B0002X7G1Q,"I remember watching As Told By Ginger when turning into a teenager. This was a great show and it sucks that they have taken it off along with other good ones on Nickeloden. Anyway, I never saw this movie but after watching it, it ended the season well and with an ending I never saw coming. Plus comes with 2 other ATBG episodes that they used to show before. Always will be an ATBG fan.",1416355200,,387,4.173333333333333
2131724,5,B0002X7G1Q,"This was an absolutely incredible movie. It could have been shown in theaters, it was that good. The movie is broken up into three 22-minute episodes. These also act as the final three episodes of the series. The last five minutes of the movie are the most bittersweet moments you will ever see on a Nickelodeon show. It will make you laugh, cry, and deeply mourn your childhood.

As Told By Ginger was such a beautiful show. It's one of the most underrated shows ever. If you haven't seen the show before, I encourage you to please watch it (it's available here on Amazon Instant Video). You will not be disappointed. And please Nickelodeon, I urge you to make an As Told By Ginger complete series DVD. The show is so beloved by many, yet so unappreciated by even more. It's amazing to think that a show like this actually existed. It makes me sad knowing we will never see another children's show this special ever again.",1414886400,3,923,4.526946107784431
2131725,3,B0002X7G1Q,"This is one of my least favorite cartoons from the late 1990s/early 2000s..... I don't like it as much as Rugrats, Hey Arnold!, or Rocko's Modern Life.",1400112000,,151,4.62962962962963
2131726,5,B0002X7G1Q,"This was a really cute show and I hated to see it end.  I think Ginger, her mom and the whole cast were very relateable for an animated show.  Loved this series.",1363046400,2,161,4.0

2131728,3,B0002X7G1Q,"When I was younger, I used to always watch this show. Watching this show at 18 is a lot different. I still think that it was a good movie it just doesn't seem the same as it did when I was younger.",1349740800,,197,3.7142857142857144
2131729,5,B0002X7G1Q,"IMO, this was a great buy, arrived quickly, had no complaints, was like new! I really loved this series when it was on TV and it was fun finding out what had happened to Ginger in the end. Thanks",1328918400,,195,4.0256410256410255
