2850262,1,B000QXDFSU,"This was my first introduction to the well known Cesar Millan that everyone was raving about. I train SAR dogs, which by their very nature are headstrong creatures. Some whispering instruction might be of use, I thought......

Yes, the video was somewhat interesting. It's kind of like watching re-runs of Gilligan's Island. You know what's going to happen, you're not going to learn anything, but it's fun to watch any way. The name dropping left me absolutely cold. I really don't care which celebrity boards his dog with Cesar Millan.

The power of the pack thing is funny. Yes, if you take a neurotic dog and place him in a pack of normal animals, the pack will enforce normal dog behavior on him. If you remove the cause of the neurosis, the nerosis goes away. That isn't rocket science.

Does Cesar Millan do anything other than straighten out neurotic dogs owned by celebrites and other neurotic and unbelievably dimwitted people?

This self agrandizing ego trip left me depressed. It's not about Cesar Millan folks, it's about the dog!",1201737600,17,1043,4.842696629213483
2850263,5,B000QXDFSU,"I really enjoyed the video of the Dog Whisperer.  I learned a lot and it helped me with our puppy.  I didn't realize that I hadn't chosen what I really needed, but this had info in it and also helped a lot.  I still want to learn more though and am currently looking for the right title.
  As a former kindergarten teacher, I learned the power of positive peer pressure and that is what Cesar has learned also, only in relation to the dogs.  I'm so glad that he has translated all this for us.  I really have to know more!",1200528000,4,522,4.108910891089109
2850264,5,B000QXDFSU,"Once again, America's leading authority on dealing with dog behavior hits the mark! I believe it is his best book yet!  We have a ""family pack"" of 15 ""fairly balanced"" dogs on our small farm. We use Cesar's pack leading methods as much as possible  and have a very happy family of dogs, because he ""trains us"" well.  Letting dogs be dogs gives us a wonderfully fulfilling life. If you want to enjoy your dog(s) to the utmost, this book is indispensible.  We have all of Cesar's books, and our lives have changed!  We are as proud of our dogs as they are of us.  THANK YOU, CESAR!!!",1200268800,6,581,4.333333333333333
2850265,5,B000QXDFSU,"I believe every person on this planet should watch/read what Cesar has to say.  Furthurmore, I believe this should be a class offered in High Schools & Colleges around the world.  Watch and you will see what I am talking about",1200009600,6,226,4.487804878048781
2850306,5,B000QXDFSU,"Cesar Milan works wonders with the dogs, amazing to watch, he explains it so everyone can understand it and better enjoy their dog.",1360022400,,131,4.739130434782608
2850307,5,B000QXDFSU,"is the greatest dog trainer ever, I've learned so much from him over the past 2 yrs. Thx 4 this",1354492800,,95,3.8
2850308,2,B000QXDFSU,"There were some helpful hints in this video but it was pretty much the same message that Cesar preaches in all his shows, books and tapes.  Somethings can be applied to your situation but others were way off base.  I am of the opinion that one size does not fit all and this is the message that Cesar spins.",1257033600,,307,4.186440677966102
2850309,5,B000QXDFSU,"THis man is the true genius of understanding the dog's makeup. Not only that, his connection with both human and dog is incredible. I'm a professional dog trainer, and I can't begin to list the things I've learned about dogs from this man. And he's very very patient and nice in person. If ever there is a person who reflects the American Dream, it's Cesar. He's the best. Man's best Friend now has, Canine's best Friend. He's done more for understanding Fido than Lassie, Rin Tin Tin and all the rest...He stands head and shoulders above the best, for he is truely the master, and has reached his personal goal of becoming the ""best dog trainer in the world"". He has, and is. Thank you Cesar Millan",1251590400,,699,4.511811023622047
2850310,4,B000QXDFSU,"My Mistake - I thought I was buying a book and it was a DVD.  I have seen many of the Dog Whisperer Shows so this was redundant to those.  I keep it as a reference for guests in our DVD library for Eden Valley Guest Ranch (our small resort).  It turned out to be a good thing as many dog people that come are not familiar with Cesar and it is a great introduction for exercise, disipline and then affection.  :)",1220054400,3,411,3.975609756097561
2850311,5,B000QXDFSU,"Very good series about sharing your life with a dog and the mistakes one can make. Sometimes very funny to see - because nearly everyone knows a person in the neighbourhood having the same problems with a dog.  Very helpful, interesting and fresh. Even for people whose dogs are too lazy to create problems.
Thank you, Cesar Millan for new ideas.",1218240000,5,346,4.672131147540983
2850312,5,B000QXDFSU,"I have owned and worked with dogs most of my life, and always learn something new from Cesar Millan.  The power of the pack was helpful, as took it to a friend who had several dogs and allways had issues with them. They didn't work together as a pack and this helped her to understand how it could be and should be. When you have a dog that does have issue's it good to know that they can be over come.  It is also just great to watch how he works with these dogs.",1211846400,18,464,3.925531914893617
2850313,1,B000QXDFSU,"We returned this item.  We had already ordered the complete 1st and 2nd Seasons.  This DVD was full of Highlights of the 1st Season.  Had we known this we would have spared Amazon the shipping costs both ways.  As far as Cesar Millan is concerned, he is amazing.  I would recommend this
series to anyone who dosen't want to order the complete series.",1210809600,9,350,4.492063492063492
2850314,4,B000QXDFSU,"Kind of a compilation of some of the cases presented during the television show. I wish it were more of a ""how to"" DVD. I'm currently reading both of Cesar's books, which do go more into depth. All in all - not bad!",1205366400,19,215,4.023255813953488
2850315,2,B000QXDFSU,"I thought this video was about how the human becomes the dominant force or the pack leader.  This video is more about how a pack of dogs controls and teaches a dog(s) in need of rehabilitation at his Dog Center. It also deals with humans overcoming their fear of large dogs. He spends an inordinate amount of time on a dog that is obsessed with rocks, but cuts to the end result two weeks later, without much information on how he got there. Although there are some obedience training tips, I found most of them vague. (i.e. when discussing how to socialize a dog with others when outside the home, it cuts right to the end where the dog is walking playfully and calm with the other dog.  He does not say how to accomplish this at all.) It seems like it is edited quickly to the result , and Milan is patting himself on the back, a lot.",1204156800,50,836,4.251572327044025
