8740073,4,B017RO6B1S,"Unknown Caller is probably mediocre, but given I like the story of a psychopath stalking a family, I'll forgive this one.  I only say it's mediocre given some strange moments where things don't quite make sense, a cliched story and not so great characters.  The story itself *does* build into something bigger and better, but it takes time.

Warning, my review contains SPOILERS!  Would be for the best if you've already seen this movie before reading my review.

The stalker is played by Henri Lubatti (I think!)  He's targeting David Chisum's character for reasons that aren't clear until much later.  David is apparently an egotistical, selfish man who only thinks of himself.  Henri wants to kill David and his family because, to put it simply, he's jealous of David.  David's character is the one who had all the success when they went to high school together.  He had the best girlfriend (played by Louise Griffiths) the best house and the most money.  Even though it's been 20 years Henri wants revenge!  That's why Henri's character wants David to think hard to remember who he is during all those phone calls early on.

The plan Henri has in mind?  To plant a bomb in the basement (already done!) and to frequently call David to remind him that if he or anyone else were to try leaving the house, it will explode.  He has the entire house rigged to explode if David doesn't comply to Henri's demands.  Nobody can step outside.  Now Henri doesn't sound very convincing as a psychopath.  At least not at first. He doesn't have the right voice.  At first he sounds like a tame young man trying to act smart to be honest!  But the more information that is mentioned and the more he annoys David and forces him to reveal the truth about his affairs to his ex-wife who's standing next to him also trapped in the house (along with the young daughter played by Anjolie Nieman) the stronger the story gets.  ""Admit you slept with 3 women or Louise's boyfriend outside gets shot!"" basically.  It's almost unintentionally funny watching the boyfriend drag his own body around outside after each gunshot all because of another David lie.  Stop lying David!

We can't ignore there's some serious moments going on here!  For one thing in the very beginning when the balloon pops, the cat close by doesn't run out of the room.  That popping balloon sounds like a gunshot!  The cat would've been outta there in a second.  When the cat almost leaves the house later on, Henri quickly shoots and kills the cat from a distance.  Smart writing there because he just saved the family's life, but why didn't the daughter run into the room after this?  Surely she heard the gunshot!  I mean it's impossible not to hear.

Also it seems logical to conclude people can't enter or exit the house based on the story up to this point, so when the ex-wife shows up to get her daughter back, I was ready for an explosion as she forced herself through the door (well not really since it would have killed everyone off early on, but logically speaking).  But... no.  Apparently the bomb only explodes when Henri wants it to by way of a trigger.  Kinda illogical writing there since we're led to think one step outside makes the house go boom boom.  And why in the WORLD did David not tell his ex-wife there's a bomb in the house and that's why she can't come in?  He waits for her to force herself inside and then tells her.  No wonder she left you David!  You can't even be honest in a really big situation!  Maybe he was ashamed he had to submit to a (at that point potential) bomber over a phone making threats, who knows.

Anyway back to the story.  While I love how Henri was able to toy with Louise's boyfriend outside by shooting at his legs (played by Assaf Cohen) thus forcing David to give in and admit all his sexual sins when he and Louise were still together, we soon realize Assaf isn't just a guy used for target practice- he's actually a reasonable and likeable guy with a degree in engineering, so he becomes a valuable asset in figuring out how to deactivate the bomb planted in the basement wall below.  I like this!  He's actually better overall than David.  David has a rough reputation of ripping people off it would seem, hence the reason for Henri's revenge.

Otherwise Henri's a pretty good character.  Yeah he starts off rather tame and normal and not the kind of person who sounds believable in making threats (but *does* sound smart) but gradually we learn to warm up to his character when it's realized he's one step ahead of David and the rest of the family the entire way.  The young daughter is a little bratty and spoiled, though perhaps some of her attitude is unintentional and she's forcing herself to be more mature in her acting role.

The movie also has a few good turns along the way, but not before one strange moment.  It's when Louise is in the shower, and Henri has a camera hooked up so everyone can see what she's doing in the bathroom.  Henri has a machine gun attached to a tree outside, and he starts shooting at her through the window before David has time to get there!  David even gets shot in the arm.  Obviously Henri wanted this family dead halfway through the story.  It seems odd because Henri seemed content to toy with David to remember who he was.  Also when David takes a laser, shines it at the gun and it goes ballistic and shoots all over the place?  WAY too unrealistic of a moment.

I didn't care for the car scene either.  David finally escapes and drives sloppy to the top of the tower where Henri's located.  Felt too much like a low budget moment to me, and to be honest the film is probably on the low budget side for the most part.  For Henri to sneak in and grab the daughter while David and Louise are having a conversation in the bedroom was a decent moment, but perhaps the writing was giving too much away here.  I liked the mystique surrounding this bomber character.  We not only see him roaming the hallways in the house, but we see he can be sloppy and bump into things.  Not the ideal impression of a guy who *just* came across as sophisticated and having a well-planned agenda.  I'd also like to know how he got the bomb in the wall but I won't dwell on this one too much.  As you know, the bad guy never says in movies like these.  Obviously the family was away when he did it but still, it laid there nice and neat!

I like how the daughter's life was in danger for a while after the white powder was put in her mouth.  I'd like to say why but I'm already giving too much away here.  Hopefully everyone took my SPOILER advice and waited until after viewing the movie to read this review.  Seriously the moment with Assaf deactivating the bomb and not knowing which wire is the right one to stop the bomb from going off might be one of the biggest cliches in action movies, but it revealed Assaf as a pretty cool guy.  Even David admitted as much.

The ending with the bomber is one you can clearly guess (and to be honest the conversation between David and Henri and why David was targeted was pretty lame because it's based around high school jealousy) but there might be one or two twists before the interaction with the bomber on top of that tower, as well as the relationship with David, Louise and Assaf afterwards that is very surprising.  In the case of the relationship, well during the final scene it took a few seconds for my brain to understand what was happening when they were all together around the grill!  A big thing happens there as far as who's with who.  I was strangely confused until it was revealed.  Let's just say, too many women (and for a moment both women looked alike, hehe)  This happens right at the end.

Overall, recommended for action fans, but it could have been less cliched in the writing.  It also could have had less nonsensical situations.  Okay characters.  The acting's very good at least.  I did really like this movie though.  By the way it's tempting to make a joke about the movie title and all the phone calls from unknown sources I kept getting while watching it but I won't. :)",1487203200,,8087,4.464163822525597

8740075,1,B017RO6B1S,"Oh, how to begin. What can be said about a film that I thought had an idea with possibilities but was so bad it just numbed the senses. The dialogue was stupid and that is giving it the benefit of the doubt. The acting was atrocious. It seemed like the husband and the wife were taking turns trying to out emote the other. Dont buy it. If you must watch it for some goofy reason, rent it from netflix or redbox or from Amazon. Even better. Buy it, watch it, then give it to someone you don't like for Christmas.",1467936000,6,511,4.12
8740076,2,B017RO6B1S,"A wealthy fracker (David Chisum) creates an electronic ""Fort Knox"" in his home. An Unknown Caller uses his home against him and entraps him in the home as well as anyone who enters. In order to save himself, momma fracker (Louise Griffiths) and baby fracker (Anjolie Nieman) i.e. the whole fracking family, he must play a game and guess who the caller is and what he wants.

The audience, like the main character have no idea who the guy could be as we see only a neighbor and the guy who installs the alarm system. The clues he gives are meaningless to us. Our antagonist isn't clever and charismatic enough to keep us interested. Might have some appeal to anarchists.
