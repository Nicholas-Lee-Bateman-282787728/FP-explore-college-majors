8417753,4,B004750O6E,"I thoroughly enjoyed this drama.  It was different because it concerned the wine industry.  The acting was very good, although the lead actress's acting was rather childish through several episodes.  The lead actor seemed rather stoic but it was tolerable.",1395532800,,256,5.35
8417754,3,B004750O6E,"Well...if you like wine you will enjoy the fact that this drama's main ""character"" is the wine industry.  I personally learned a great deal about wine while watching this show!  As for the actual drama...it left me thinking...was there a point?  I storyline was a bit thrown together and didn't seem to come together as well as it could have.  Also, I never felt connected to main characters.  They were OK but missing chemistry.  To sum up, I would say, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. Not one I would revisit.",1352160000,,519,4.586956521739131
