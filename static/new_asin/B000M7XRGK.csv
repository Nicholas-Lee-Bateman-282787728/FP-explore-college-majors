8166917,1,B000M7XRGK,"Jamie Foxx should be ashamed for associating himself with this mess. Funny is funny, but this was just remedial, like an episode of BET's Comic View - You always saw the people laughing uncontrollably, but never understood what it was that they were laughing at, 'cause the jokes were never that funny.. It's like that here - corny and the same old racist and anti gay stuff, with a touch of god material to make it seem okay to the target audience.... I also find it funny that most black people scream the loudest about anything being remotely racist, but have absolutely no problem being racist or homophobic themselves (overtly or blatantly)..and just brushing it off with ""that's just how we do."".... Hypocrisy isn't entertaining, it's just frustrating, ignorant and sad.. Btw, the funniest person in this whole group is Bill Burr, and surprise, he's not mentioned on the packaging because he's white, and the powers that be in charge of the packaging at Code Black won't put anyone white on their cover - he's not even mentioned in the synopsis..",1400198400,,1052,4.81767955801105

you will laugh the whole time, You need to add this to your collection!",1362268800,,167,3.8
8166920,4,B000M7XRGK,"Jamie Foxx does a great job of putting together some solid performers. He also does well not to try telling any jokes himself. I would have given this a 31/2 star rating if I could. It was all done professionally. We are introduced to some impressive up-and-coming comedians. Cedric makes a good host. He has his finger firmly on the pulse of urban observational comedy. He knows how to draw a laugh out of the crowd. In the next instalment, I hope Jamie gets Michael Colyar to host the show (""Yes, bring out the next M***F**"")

The opening act is very good (I just forget his name). There are plenty of laughs all the way through. What is nice is that all the acts have the proverbial 3rd eye of comedy (a la Steve Harvey) and are able to introduce interesting and original perspectives. There is something in it for all. Be warned that there is plenty of cussing if that sort of thing scares you.

Well done Jamie. You have brought in on!",1191628800,,940,4.396551724137931
