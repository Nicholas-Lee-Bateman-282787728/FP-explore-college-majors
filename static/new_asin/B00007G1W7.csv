1808386,5,B00007G1W7,"As enigmatic as the show, we get a few answers, but more questions. Alucard is the coolest thing out there & we finally get an answer as to why he'd bother serving humans. There's a lot left to the imagination, although that last smile on Integra's face suggests enough. This show has been in the depressing/heroes-on-the-short-end-of-the-stick mode of anime one doesn't really get in American shows(we have to have that happy ending) so I was expecting mass slaughter of all the characters by the final ep. The short-end-of-the-stick is there, but entirely in keeping with what has come before & leaves a lot for the viewer to decide. We get the confirmation Alucard is Vlad the Impailer which everyone had to suspect(in fact the little picture for ep 13 inside gave that away to any who've seen the painting of Vlad which has survived) & classic vampire myth action--this isn't Buffy or any of that cheap vampire stuff one finds in the straight-to-video horror section at the local video rental store. By this disc, I was pretty good at figuring where each ep would end(the worst possible place) & my daughter commented we're lucky we didn't have to wait a week between eps as one would if it were airing on tv.",1043539200,,1213,4.726415094339623

1808388,5,B00007G1W7,"If you're a fan of the other volumes of the Hellsing seires, you won't be dissapointed. I won't give any spoilers in this review. This dvd is probably the darkest and edgiest of the series. I think they did a great job winding the tension up through the previous 3 volumes and it continues flawlessly into this one to an epic final confrontation. If you haven't started the series yet, do yourself a favor and get them. This series was stylish, engaging and as all good anime does, it ropes you in to make you want to see the rest of the story. I hope they produce more.",1142208000,,570,4.287037037037037
1808389,5,B00007G1W7,ok i have the first three disks but does this come with the last 4 chapters? and does alucard die? i must know and don't forget....... FATHER ANDERSON ROCKS!,1136764800,,157,4.448275862068965
1808390,4,B00007G1W7,"Welcome to the Hellsing Organization; an army dedicated to keep the country safe from the undead.  The group fights against vampires and ghouls of all sorts in the dark of night.  Their ultimate weapon is a hunter that is a vampire himself, Alucard; an unstoppable figure that can face just about any sort of evil that the darkness has to offer him.  Vampires and ghouls are not safe with this elite team of hunters and soldiers lurking about.
""Hellsing: Eternal Damnation"" is the final volume in this series.  Sadly, the journey ends, although it leaves room for another addition to come in the near future.  As Sir Integra fights for her life in critical condition, her mind flashes back to the first time she met Alucard and how she became the leader of the Hellsing Organization.  While it's still not clear what the exact relationship between Alucard and her father was truly based on, we are at least given another piece to the puzzle.  Later on, an unspeakable and deadly trap is set, leaving the Hellsing group extremely vulnerable.  Seras must get a grip on what she really is and find her true courage within herself if she wishes to live and continue the ongoing battle between them and the vampires, while Alucard faces the what seems to be an unstoppable foe, Incognito, for one last time.  This is where things really get interesting, as the next few moments will ultimately decide the fate of the Hellsing Organization--and possibly the fate of humanity as well.
I'm sad that this journey ended so quickly, but am overall extremely pleased with how this series was conducted and executed.  It's true that there's no concrete ending, but it leaves us with enough to not feel cheated or disappointed.  There are loose ends, of course; however, these loose ends foreshadow the possibility of a second series to come in the future.  The last episode really shows us just how effective and powerful Alucard truly is, while we get to finally see Seras' courage overcome her fears and weaknesses.  And yes, we even get to see how strong Sir Integra really is when she is fighting for her life in the tenth episode.
This last chapter of the ""Hellsing"" series is just as dark and violent as the past volumes, if not more.  Again, this is not a cartoon for children.  These remaining four episodes contain graphic violence, blood and gore, strong language, adult situations, and dark and disturbing themes and imagery.  Unlike the past three DVDs, this one contains four episodes instead of three; with the entire feature running at about 95 minutes long.  Extras include a creditless ending, concept art, weapons gallery and more.
I found ""Hellsing: Eternal Damnation"" to be a satisfactory conclusion to this mesmerizing and dark series, even if the ending is not exactly concrete.  I really do hope that another addition to this series is in the making, as I could see them doing great things with it.  My overall thoughts on this series are extremely positive as I enjoyed every minute of the ride and regret nothing.  The ""Hellsing"" series is remarkable proof of what anime is capable of producing.  The journey into Hell and darkness has come to an end--for now...",1074816000,8,3174,4.797794117647059
1808391,5,B00007G1W7,"The final chapter in this series is also the best, culminating in a slam-bang final confrontation between Alucard and the villian that will amaze the viewer. Helsing is not as popular as some other Anime series and that is a shame. It is well worth your time and money.",1053820800,,269,4.510204081632653
1808392,5,B00007G1W7,"The Japanese seem to find the western version of the Vampire myth quite appealing, and the expression of that fascination reaching a peak with the anime series Hellsing.
The fourth and concluding volume of the series offers four episodes.  In the first, Sir Integra Hellsing--leader of the Hellsing Organization dedicated to defending ""God, Queen, and Country"" from the ravages of vampires--must battle for her life after slitting her throat to avoid becoming undead after a vampire attack.  In the episode, much of the history between Alucard and Integra is revealed, though never exactly why the vampire serves a human against his own kind.
Ensuing episodes culminate in a battle between Alucard and the evil Incognito.  The ending doesn't exactly convey a true sense of completeness, suggesting a sequel in the works, as neither do we find out who was responsible for the artificial freak vampires or what becomes of Integra.
If you haven't already figured out who Alucard really is--from his own statement of the anagram nature of his name (look at it in a mirror!) to his method of dispatching Incognitio, neither the series nor I shall come right out and tell you--but you'll figure it out.
The animation itself is done really well in terms of visual quality, with a blend of CG and hand-drawn cel work; however, it is somewhat more static in nature than much contemporary anime, comparable to that done for the Record of Lodoss War series.
The audio, though presented only in stereo sound, features a soundtrack you'll want to hunt down like a freak after fresh blood.  Surprisingly, the english dubbing is quite good, featuring British-accented voice actors far superior to the average anime dub.
Hellsing is an excellent addition to any anime fan's library and a must-watch for vampire lovers everywhere.",1051142400,6,1813,5.053511705685619
1808393,5,B00007G1W7,"""In the name of God, impure souls will be banished to eternal damnation. Amen.""
Hunting the undead is a nasty business, but someone has to protect Her Majesty and Britain. In the Hellsing organization its more than just an objective, it flows in the bloodline that's been culminating in those veins throughout the centuries. To achieve these ends, some oddly fashioned means must be adopted, though, including the use of state-of-the-art technology, forces that are highly trained in the matters of disposal, and a certain secret weapon called Arucard. Yes, it is their duty to dispose of the threats to queen and country, and even the use of something as powerful as he, a vampire that seems almost unstoppably magnificent in his abilities, is suitable as a weapon to forward those causes. May God and her majesty be with you.
In these last 4 episodes bringing the series to a head, many things take places that work in the realms of explanations, dealing with the loose ends that seem to trouble even Arucard as he struggles to find suitable prey as it does so. This leads to oceans of blood and a rich atmosphere of violence that climaxes in the best of fashions, rewarding those who have been proud enough to stand throughout the continuing struggle. None of these rank in the realms of the disposable, either, building upon brick after carefully laid brick and making it all the more worthwhile.
The orders included are:
Order 10, Master of the Monster, where the mysterious connection between our beloved vampire and his master are finally revealed, plus some finality is given to some of the deeds taking place in Order 9. Herein is the explanation I know I was waiting for, helping to bring to light not only the mysterious Arucard but also Sir Integra and her ascension to the top of the Hellsing ladder.
Order 11, Transcend Force, spotlights a plan that is thrown into action of the darkest sorts as an army of ghouls is created from some specially trained forces and used to threaten her majesty herself. Still, Hellsing is ready to play ball - or are they? This order touches on some undead ranks of past episodes, playing games with the parties of a powerful nature.
Order 12, Total Destruction, sets things into motion that with a battle that pits Freaks against the legions of Hellsing, Arucard against the nemesis he's been desiring, and Sir Integra against the military? Within it is one of the sadder moments in the series as a something a valuable member of Hellsing is lost, too, not to mention some of the more interestingly intense struggles within the realms of brutal struggle.
Order 13, Hellfire, finally brings many of the mysteries within the series to a climax, pitting, amongst other things, Sett against a fully unrestricted Arucard in a battle that amounts to the sheer pleasure. It also holds many of the keys to Hellsing and Sir Integra's unsure future as well, rewarding the viewer with a few feats of lovely carnage and out-and-out undead warfare.
If you are a newer recruit to the ranks of Hellsing, do not skip ahead! Follow the exploits of the organization from the onset to the climax, and you will be rewarded in your struggles. If you have followed these instructions, then this comes as something of the highest recommendation order.",1045008000,9,3275,4.7982300884955755
1808394,5,B00007G1W7,"Hellsing is an awesome series.  thats all I have to say. if you have the first DVDS you MUST buy this to complete your collection.
I just wanted to answer a couple of questions..maybe I can clear some stuff up.  Integra's father and the hellsing organization did experiments on alucard and made him a ultra powerful vampire. Then he sealed him below the hellsing castle in case Integra needed him as a body guard.  And she did.
In the end, I'm trying to figure out what happened.  You can see that Integra is under arrest (She has bindings on her wrists and there are guards at the door).  Alucard is in the room.  He either is asking Integra if she wants to become a vampire too (remember, he asked her in an earlier episode), or if she wants him to kill the guards and break her out.  I guess its all up to you...",1044316800,6,815,4.253246753246753
1808395,5,B00007G1W7,"I think I have been waiting for this, the final DVD in the Hellsing series for what seems like an eternity (actually it's been a mere two months).  Anime has a great love for vampire stories, for obvious reasons.  People like them and the writers and illustrators can let their imaginations run wild within the 'comfortable' constraints of the genre.  And every now and then, somebody actually does something special.  Like Miyu and D, Hellsing is one of the latter cases.  Loud, jazzy, with a lot of stylish art, it is a showpiece even though the episodes sometimes get repetitive.  Think of it as a kind of gothic noirish Cowboy Bebop.  With a dash of Armageddon thrown in.
We start the final set with Integra Hellsing fighting for her life in the hospital, all of the main characters in attendance.  Bitten by one of Incognito's minions, Integra has cut her own throat to keep from being vampirized.  As the medical staff struggles for her life, the head of the Hellsing Organization dreams of the events that made her what she is and delivered Alucard (Dracula) to her as a servant.  Pay attention, because this is the last slow moment before a three-episode rush to the conclusion.
All the usual crises develop, this escalating rapidly as an attack on the Queen in the Tower of London metamorphoses into a giant plot by Incognito to send London down to the pits of hell.  Thanks to a bit of betrayal, all sides go through troops as if they were tissue paper - red tissue paper, to be precise.  You will definitely want to make some popcorn and settle back as the fate of London hangs on a battle between two equally stylish but loony vampires.
The ending leaves more than a few loose ends.  In particular, we never find out who is making the chips that are making vampires.  Or why they are making them.  And I'm not sure that Seras has made up her mind about being a vampire yet.  This implies that, just maybe, some day, there might be a sequel or a film.  That works for me - and I'm sure it will for you once you investigate.",1044230400,6,2034,4.483695652173913
1808396,5,B00007G1W7,"Hellsing is by far the most original and interesting anime I've seen. This DVD contains both the Japanese unedited and English dubs. Before you start thinking, ""Ewwwww, the english dubs to any anime always stinks!!!"", let me assure you that the voice actor for Arucard is played by Cripin Freeman and frankly, he did an excellent job portraying Arucard. Anyway, this volume comes with the last 4 episodes, of this 13 episode series. In episode 9, we see the history behind Integra and Arucard, how they met and why Integra is his master. The last three episode focuses on the destruction of the Hellsing organization by a master vampire named, Incognito, betrayal by the Knights of the Round TAble, Seras Victoria going ballistic with her Harconnon Cannon, blasting away every single freak chip vampire in her sights and Arucard/Incognito's final battle in the Tower of London. Arucard dies in the battle, or does he...and the audience is finally shown his true identity in the end. Wanna know who he is, you'll have to buy yourself a copy to find.",1044057600,,1048,4.860335195530726
1808397,5,B00007G1W7,"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant. I truly hope they continue with the series cause this last one leaves you wanting more. Really one of the best Animes I've seen, right up there with Ninja Scroll. Maybe even better.",1043625600,,214,4.972222222222222

7975819,5,B00007G1W7,"Since nobody else will review the action figure that comes with it, I will.
This dvd comes packed with an action figure Of Seras Victoria (at least it does if you buy it new,) and the figure is pretty well sculpted, decently painted, and over-all nice quality.
Her body shape is perfect.
The police girl also comes withe the coolest and best designed figure accessory I have ever seen, her harkonnen cannon as well as a shell or bullet to reload into the gun and a hospital blood-pack on the side.
The gun even has moving parts and can be reloaded!
She comes in at around 5-inches (since she is a teenager, this means she is probably in the six-inch scale) and she is wearing her blue uniform.
poseability is virtually non-existent here, as only her feet and head rotate, but she can hold the gun very well, but good luck trying to make her stand whilst holding it.

There is my review. great figure, with some minor flaws.",1450656000,,923,4.461538461538462
7975820,3,B00007G1W7,"Last episode was very disappointing. I didn't like the ending, it's was weird and confusing. For such a great Anime, the ending was a disaster.

7975826,4,B00007G1W7,"I remeber when this Anime, Hellsing was played on the Action network. For the action anime, just a year or so before [Adult Swim] even aired.
