8131972,3,B000GGSM30,"I was disappointed overall with both Seasons one and two.  .  Perhaps I expected too much, but since you asked for my review I am telling what I thought.  Each actor, in my opinion, is capable of a much better, funnier performance.",1163030400,3,231,4.4523809523809526
8131973,4,B000GGSM30,"I bought Seasons 1 and 2 a couple of weeks ago and while I have enjoyed the episodes, I am a little confused about the extras. According to Amazon.com and the back of the DVD covers:

S1 is supposed to include the ""1987 Christmas Special"". My copy only contains the 6 S1 episodes.

S2 is supposed to include ""Footlights: 100 years of comedy - 56 minutes of documentary featuring early Fry & Laurie material"" . My copy contains a 46 minute show called the ""Cambridge Footlights"" (I think), which is a show of earlier material of Fry & Laurie's, and while entertaining, it definitely not a documentary.

Has anyone else found the same problem with their copies?

13 Sept - update - I have since heard from someone in the UK that the Christmas Special is actually the first episode of the Season 1 set. Apparently it was going to be a one off show, but turned out so popular, that they added an extra 5 shows and made it into a complete season. I think it is just a case of the DVDs not being labelled very clearly for us non-UK fans :-).",1157846400,7,1035,4.319587628865979
8131974,5,B000GGSM30,"I've been a big Hugh Laurie fan for years. (Quite fond of Stephen Fry as well, but Hugh is my favorite.) I have the ""Best Of"" on VHS from years ago and have been dying for the show to be put on DVD.

Some of the humor is a bit over the top, and some is the dry, understated wit that the Brits are known for. All in all, I'd highly recommend this to any fan of British comedy!",1156032000,6,375,3.7468354430379747
8131975,5,B000GGSM30,"There's a good chance that anyone reading this review is already a fan of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, but if you haven't seen the show I would highly recommend that you give it a try.  I recorded the show onto VHS when it played on my local PBS station years and years ago.  I show my friends this amazingly funny show every chance I get and it is received very well.  Just a warning...if you don't like British comedy, you may not like this.  The comedy is much more intelligent and subtle than most American comedies and a lot of people can't get into that.  But for you fans of British Comedy (you know who you are) it doesn't get much better than A Bit of Fry and Laurie.",1154476800,5,672,4.099236641221374
8131976,5,B000GGSM30,"This is by far the funniest comedy show I have ever seen, surpassing even Monty Python and Rowan Atkinson. I'm so glad it is finally being released on American DVD. Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are not to be missed!",1153353600,5,214,4.375
8131977,5,B000GGSM30,"Now you can hear Hugh Laurie with his real accent, and playing a gamut of characters with the godfather of his kids, Stephen Fry. Unbelievably consistently funny sketch comedy. Let's hope they release all 4 seasons of this inspired, intelligent lunacy. Also, check out Hugh Laurie's hilarious spy novel, ""The Gunseller"".",1152316800,4,320,5.294117647058823
