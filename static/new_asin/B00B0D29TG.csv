5540281,3,B00B0D29TG,"I do adore Renee Fleming, and so fell for another reviewer's rave of this DVD.  Musically, it is lovely.  Thielemann is a fine Straussian, and all the singers look beautiful and sing with great artistry.  But for my taste, the staging is all wrong.  Both Hoffmannsthal and Strauss intended this to be a barb aimed at rich patrons, but also a deep analysis of great art vs. what Wagner critiqued as triviality.  What could be more trivial than a nightclub, which this staging offers as substitute for the Grecian Isle of Naxos?  Fleming herself contributes to the operetta feeling, singing the tragic aria ""Es Gibt Ein Reich"" with a slightly regretful smile as she flirts with a black veil.  She is gorgeous of face and voice, the perfect Thais or Rusalka, but if you want the heart-searing emotion and the consequent elation of the apotheosis, go to Jessye Norman.  And the scruffy appearance of Robert Dean Smith is more like my dog Bacchus (god of whine, get it?) than the rescuing magnificence of the God whose entrance music alone is overwhelming.  The nymphs who are so appealingly sketched wear pleated gold lame and Zerbinetta's troupe is catchily clad as Marcel Marceau - and very vocal for mimes.  All the effects are clever affectation, pretty but nothing that stirs the heart and soul as this music should..
I was totally underwhelmed by this whole production of one of my favorite works..",1375574400,21,1400,4.795833333333333
5540282,5,B00B0D29TG,"As the newest entry in the Ariadne sweepsteaks, this  DVD is clearly a major contender. For those hoping for a ""period"" (18th century) setting you will be disappointed. But really should you? After all both the composer and the librettist were playing with the conceit of an opera cum Comedia del Arte sharing the stage with a Greek legend, a concept not unknown to most regie directors. The settinig for this production is clearly contemporary--with some variation. What really matters is that it is stylish, imaginative and beautifully sung. I can't imagine anyone being offended by it.

Musically it is in great hands. Thielemann and the Dresden Staatskapelle. Could you ask for more? But it also delivers vocally. The greatest surprise for me was the Komponist of Sophie Koch. This is her second go round--she appeared in a early taping from Dresden in a performance directed by Colin Davis. She was very good but here she almost effaces memories of Seefried, Jurinac and Zylys-Gara--sopranos. Indeed Koch sounds less ""mezzoish"" than her Oktavian. The top is open and she soars through her music with freedom and surety. If I didn't know that Koch was the artist I might have guessed that a soprano was singing. Fleming has been reducing the number of appearances that she has made in the past. That she is (ungallant of me to mention it) past fifty (but doesn't look it or sound it) is simply a statistic. Usually the role is sung by a German equivalent of a lyric spinto; the Baden house is not a barn so her purely lyric soprano is not taxed to produce volumn that is not hers to give. While she will never be a text oriented artist I find that she is becomiing more interesting singer as she had gotten older. Certainly the work she has done with Thielemann has represented an artistic advancement over much that has gone before. The Zerbinetta, Jane Archibald was not know to me. She sails though her role with the greatest of ease matching even Gruberova and Dessay. She may lack the latter's stage presence but that is only a minor cavil. And what of the Bacchus? Robert Dean Smith should have been the Tristan when Glydndebourne mounted the opera in the early aughts and later revived it. He deputized for Heppner at the Meet and did receive an HD performance of Tristan. I was fortunate enough to see him in Frosch in LA. Thielemann should have chosen him for the Salzburg Frau. He sings the role as well as can be expected. Perhaps only Kaufmann can make it sound beautiful. Unfortunately that sounds like damming with faint praise and that is not fair. Smith's current competition in the Ariadne DVD lineuup is not very competitive and he trumps them all but he turns in a performance that maintains the very high vocal standard of this performance. Actually the singing (and acting) set a very high level and there are no weak spots. I can't imagine it being better performed.",1370390400,15,2892,4.713438735177865

8560250,3,B00B0D29TG,"I love this opera but have been spoiled by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Gundula Janowitz, whose recordings I have on CD. I usually like Rene Fleming too, but not at all in this opera. She attacks her notes from below, like a passionate Italian, rather than spot on or even from above, like a cool German. I also blame Thielemann for the failure of Es gibt ein Reich to soar, as his tempi here, and elsewhere too, are rather plodding. Zerbinetta looks and acts the part wonderfully, but even she has trouble with some of her highest notes. As for the barbershop quartet, I doubt Strauss ever saw one and it seems out of place here. Finally, the sets, or lack thereof. There are in fact no sets at all  when an island is called for, a wooden packing crate marked INSEL sits center stage; when a cave is called for, there is a grand piano at a perilous angle. Why bother staging the opera at all? Disappointing.",1449273600,5,905,4.419161676646707

8560255,5,B00B0D29TG,"Richard Strauss could write for the female voice like no composer before or since. And by that I mean the different types and ranges of the female voice. Just think of the last act of Rosenkavalier trio and duet. Or the three women in Ariadne (or the three in Die Agyptiche Helen with Aithra and her omniscient shell). Men don't fare so well as this horrendous part for Bacchus shows. (We'll see what Jonas Kaufmann does in a soon-to-be-released recording of Ariadne).
Here the radiant primadonna (Ariadne) is the radiant Renee Fleming. She is every bit as poised, composed and in command as my first recorded Ariadne, Elizabeth Schwarzkopf. (Ms. Schwarzkopf never did it on stage).They both approached the role as a ""lieder"" singer rather than an Wagnerian type of Jesse Norman and Deborah Voigt. Ms. Fleming is all about shading and subtle nuance in telling the story. In this she stands above most of the dozen or so recordings that have been since the 1957 Swartzkopf, Rita Streich, Irmgard Seefried entry. The catalog of Ariadne recordings is growing yearly. In the Wagner type singer we have Tomowa-Sintov with Kathlene Battle as Zerbinetta in 1987. She is  also in the 1988 Jesse Norman disc; Ms Norman is a commanding presence as the Primadonna Ariadne and as the Composer Tatiana Troyanos is the champion of all time.  Deborah Voigt made a great CD with Sinopoli and of course she is the star among the best productions ever with James Levine in 2005. She has such a tremendous big beautiful tone, I've not heard after that in more recent recordings.
So many recordings, such great singing but many with one or two weak roles in the production. That does not occur in the present recording. There simply are no weak parts in it. And I mean with all things considered; sets (beautiful and workable), costumes, orchestra(Sachsische Staatskapelle Dresden) and conductor, Christian Thielemann. He has a light, sure, subtle touch that brings out the inherent beauty of this ravishing score.
The other ladies of the score are simply superb. The composer of Sophie Koch is all awkward youth on it's way to budding maturity but a long way to go. She sang the part effortlessly and with eyes wide open. (Troyanos is still my favorite).
The Zerbinetta of Jane Archibald (a name not familiar to me) almost stole the show. She glided through those roulades and trills and high F' s  as if there's nothing to it. I can think of only one other that matches such technique and that's Beverly Sills of the 1969 telecast directed by Leinsdorf. Ms. Archibald not only commands the stage but her subtle use of hand and eye and shrug and talk about stage presence! She will be the standard for any and all Zerbinettas  of the future.
The Bacchus is an unforgiving exercise in highest tenor tessitura that strains my throat just to listen to it. Robert Dean Smith did a commendable job with that daunting part. I remember in the first Ariadne I heard, the 1957 (Schwarzkopf) the Bacchus of Rudolph Schock sang ""Ich bin ein  Gott"" maybe so but the music must have been written by the Devil.
I was so happy to see my favorite Tristan of ages past, Rene' Kollo as the Major Domo. He still knows how to charge around the stage in high style.
A great performance and recording. Get it!",1394409600,8,3268,4.716287215411558
8560256,5,B00B0D29TG,"Whilst there will never be another Irmgard Seefried nor Lisa Della Casa for the Composer and Ariadne respectively, and I do not have them on the same discs anyway, this is very much a modern day wish list and beautifully so. A clever clear staging, nice video cutting from Brian Large and vocally and orchestrally superb.

Whilst I am not an out and out fan of Fleming, I liked her Zurich Arabella vocally and here there is much to like about her Ariadne. She even looks right (not something she did in Arabella) and apart from some odd non Germanic inflections gives a very convincing performance without ever being Wagnerian! Just how it should be down really!

The other stars are Sophie Koch as the composer, is there ever a badly cast composer? Koch's acting is marvellous also. Jane Archibald is also superb as zerbinetta. Dean Smith is probably just right as Bacchus. The supporting cast can't be faulted either.

I found myself replaying the DVD it's that good....

As to any criticism of the period setting I liked the contemporaneous feel it fits the modern sounding dance music Strauss gave the dance troop....it's only 1916 but sounds later, perhaps one of the attractions of the work overal is that it sounds so modern! And also it contains so many simply lovely tunes and melodies this cast never fail to handle with consummate love and care. Theileman conducts with a careful regard to tempo. Zerbinetta sounds a little slow but between them Archibald and Thieleman ring every nuance possible and it's quite quite lovely!

Highly recommended!",1377302400,4,1557,4.838345864661654
