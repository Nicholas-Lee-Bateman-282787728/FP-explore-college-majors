3883771,5,B002ACKBUU,"If you like live performances, you've got to check this out. Pete Townshend's acoustic version of Pinball Wizard is brilliant as is Jeff Beck and Clapton doing Cause We've Ended As Lovers. Bob Geldof's I Don't like Mondays is a highlight. Check out The Secret Policeman's Other Ball too.",1369353600,,287,4.877551020408164
3883772,4,B002ACKBUU,"Actuaciones de antologia, como las de Sting, Phil Collins y principalmente Pete Townshend, demostrando que fue y es un gran guitarrista armnico, tiene un manejo ritmico de u guitarra inigualable. Tambin el duo de Clapton / Beck, en fin es un concierto inperdible!!!",1296345600,,265,5.186046511627907
3883773,3,B002ACKBUU,"I have several of these 'Balls' on VHS and was happy to hear that they were to be reissued on DVD, but was  disappointed with the results for several reasons. First, the sound quality hasn't been updated - a definite drag in our digital era. Second, the selections leave a bit to be desired; it's like they went for the obvious rather than include the obscure - example: no Ian Anderson, Robert Plant being backed by a band that included Mick Karn and Phil Collins as a rhythm section (a smokin' first),along with Gary Brooker (Procol Harum) on keys. This band did an amazing version of 'Whiter Shade Of Pale', and also played behind Pete Townsend and Kate Bush (represented on a smaller scale here). And there's too much acoustic stuff to constitute real rock. Thirdly, the video itself hasn't been cleaned up let alone remastered, making this lackluster, lackadaisical and lacking true balls...",1284076800,15,896,4.818181818181818
3883774,5,B002ACKBUU,Great performances by rock legends to benefit Amnesty Int'l.  Highlighted by Beck and Clapton.  This is a keeper.,1282262400,,113,5.222222222222222
3883775,3,B002ACKBUU,"If you aren't a fan of [primarily] British comedy but love British music, this DVD is a compilation of the Secret Policeman's Balls [concerts]. You can't really use the term ""Rocks"" as most of the DVD is acoustic.

On the negative side, they didn't do much to improve the audio or video [still specs in the video] and maybe they had little choice but audio fades aren't great.

On the near positive side, there is also over an hour of interview footage with most of the musicians including a big chunk of recent interviews from Pete Townshend. The interviews are both old and new. What I didn't like much is the editing/splicing.",1258156800,6,629,4.607142857142857
3883776,4,B002ACKBUU,"A recent Australian edition concludes some this stuff under title ""Secret Policemen's Music Edition"".

Short of visual and audio special techno effects, performing presents a real class of musicians' natural skills and abilities.

Hopefully, the US production will be sharper on merits of technical DVD presentation as images are a bit blur.",1248825600,3,341,5.538461538461538

8359241,2,B002ACKBUU,"This really could use some remastering.  The video is passable, but not knowing what source material is still available could make this a challenge.  I wish they had more of the performers as well.  TRB and Neil Innes come to mind.",1440547200,2,231,4.585365853658536

8359243,1,B002ACKBUU,I searched under CD/Vinyl and I got a Video DVD. Shame on me for not looking closer but the description did not say anything about this just being video. I can't put this on iTunes. I can't even use my own choice of program to play it back. It has it's own playback program embedded in the DVD itself. Waste of money.,1406160000,,317,4.129032258064516

8359245,4,B002ACKBUU,"The four stars are generous, and intended to encourage the release of archival rarities such as this.  These are great and unique performances of great songs by great artists, but the sound quality and editing leave much to be desired in comparison to the original, still out-of-print, audio releases.  This was clearly further editing of an already edited broadcast master, with a mono mix subjected to a fake stereo effect for the DVD.  A release truly respectful to these performances would have taken the time and trouble to go back to original sources to achieve the best possible quality, and to repair the horrifying disembowelment of the historic Townshend/Williams acoustic duet performance of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"".",1396396800,5,728,5.205128205128205
