8277011,1,B001AD8FQW,"This is a cult classic film that deserves four stars -- but I gave it only one because it is absolutely ruined by the atrocious, horrible Amazon print. Looks like an 8mm home movie that's been stored in a damp garage for 50 years -- damaged, noisy, scratched, AWFUL. Not even worth the $.99 I paid. Amazon should be ashamed to even make this ruined 4:3 print available -- the original film is in CinemaScope -- but this copy is like kicking the creators in the groin. Amazon should be humiliated having their customers seeing this trash print of what should be an enjoyable film.",1482796800,4,579,4.523809523809524

8277013,2,B001AD8FQW,The print of this film is atrocious; like watching thru a dirty window.  It was originally shot in CinemaScope.  This print is in 1.33:1 format.  The color is almost totally washed out.  Amazon should be ashamed to rent/sell anything in this condition.,1450051200,,252,4.928571428571429
8277014,1,B001AD8FQW,"This ""print on demand"" disc contains a lousy DVD transfer of a video of atrocious quality filmed in a movie theater while the movie (""L'Atlantide"") was running on the screen. It may likely be a clandestine copy. Of course the colors are almost faded, the viewpoint of the video camera was slightly to low, and the transfer of the video to the DVD has changed the aspect ratio: the picture is heavily compressed/ squeezed in its height.",1396396800,4,435,4.662337662337662
8277015,1,B001AD8FQW,"Bad acting, bad directing, and predictable. Might have been interesting back in the 40s or 50s. Just another excuse to look at half naked women.",1354320000,,144,4.8
8277016,3,B001AD8FQW,"What can I say? I have always had a soft spot for films that tackle the ancient mystery of Atlantis. Unfortunately few good films about this topic exist. So much fiction and non-fiction literature exists on this ancient enigma, as I discovered when I wrote my MA thesis on Atlantis many years ago, but so little of that literature made its way to the screen.

This DVD version of a French novel, featuring a multi-nationality cast, has been taken, like JOURNEY TO THE LOST CITY, from a 16 millimeter original, so the colors are almost non-existent.  Familiar French actor Jean-Louis Tritignant is a low-key hero who must have not been paid by the amount of dialogue he was asked to speak, and George Riviere, who was given more to do in the horror film CASTLE OF BLOOD opposite the dark and enchanting Barbara Steele, is practically drop kicked out of the film early. Rad Fulton, who looks like an early Johnny Depp, has some screen charisma, particularly for teen girls, but he is also wasted as the token American. For some reason, his death scene is not shown; it is only talked about. This film is directed by the B-movie great (see  DETOUR) Edgar Elmer, but in this case, he must have phoned in his directions from across the ocean.

Ocean. No ocean can be found in this film as the resting place of the famed lost continent of Atlantis, mentioned by none other than Plato, because, of course, it is titled JOURNEY BENEATH THE DESERT. For that we must blame the original novel L'ATLANTIDE, as this 1960 film was also called. This Atlantis, as in the horrible John Erickson spy adventure, is under the desert. Those commercially minded producers-salesmen who task it is to come up with successful film titles must have been on vacation when this film was released to the public  Never mind that such a location makes it easier to destroy in an ending we can see coming a mile off, we still have the nefarious types in command of the empire, ruled by Charlton Heston's love interest in BEN-HUR.

I have often wondered why more films about Atlantis have not been made into big-screen films. George Pal's film ATLANTIS THE LOST CONTINENT, released in the early 1960s by MGM, had potential. Unfortunately, it was hampered by an unknown leading man whose voice on the screen was obviously not his own, just as Jacques Sernas' own voice was not used in HELEN OF TROY. Joyce Tailor was lovely, and John Dall of SPARTACUS made a good cackling heavy, but so much stock footage from QUO VADIS, which was poorly integrated into a wide-screen production, made it look ludicrous on the big screen. Other films have tackled the theme, but low budgets and luke-warm delivery have consigned them to the vaults of forgetfulness. You see? I can't even think of the titles of those films as I sit here at my MAC.

This film, where the ineffectual hero emerges at the end  as the lone survivor only to discover himself in a bomb-testing area, belongs in those vaults of obscurity. Or under the desert. Too bad.",1249344000,4,2994,4.646502835538753
