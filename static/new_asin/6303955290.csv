7856993,4,6303955290,"You know you're in for a wild, weird ride when the film's opening scene has a man find a woman's nude corpse in a Mexico City trash heap - and then he proceeds to hump it. Fun for the entire family! But, after all, this pelicula isn't called ""Slaves of Sadism"" for nothing.

This is basically a rough police procedural about cruel criminals who kidnap young women, get them addicted to drugs and then use them for sadomasochistic purposes (which, naturally, they film). Jorge Reynoso, who looks like a cross between Lou Ferrigno and Andre the Giant with a head the size and shape of Shrek's, is the detective on the case, and you can beat that a fair amount of beatings and other violence will be doled out at his hands before the movie's end.

Definitely not for kids. But connoisseurs of weird, south-of-the-border cinema rejoice!",1281657600,,832,4.653061224489796
