7849454,3,6303503829,"This 1986 film set in the deserts of India takes place in the 40's and it has elements of music, a lengthy dance number and the occasional beating.  I won't say the violence comes across authentic, but regardless, it is visible including violence against women.  With the desert isolated landscape, you will also see mounds of red chili peppers everywhere.

It is a small village and the sudebar (tax collector) had the power to collect assessed taxes from villagers and, in his evilness, he sets out to collect more than taxes.  He charms the villagers with his phonograph.  When his advances are spurned by a beautiful Indian woman, Sonbai, the sudebar is out to capture her.  She takes refuge in the Spice chili pepper factory.  An old guard is her protector and the men finally force their way into the factory.

The video format with its English subtitles, are often very difficult to read.  The titles are white and often up against light background.  The music can be grating and so can the sound effects of horses clomping around.  .....Rizzo",1160352000,3,1050,4.777777777777778

But once this film gets started with its principal event (about 60 minutes in), you won't look up again until its over.
This film tells a simple story but it explores important universal human themes: the nature of civilization, taxation, liberty, honor and dignity, and power (over others).  Perhaps you will only get out of this film what you bring in, but even if you only get a little I think it will be worth your time.  A wonderful film that keeps you wondering right to the end.",1080518400,6,655,4.433333333333334
