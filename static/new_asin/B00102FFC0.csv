8236620,1,B00102FFC0,"I have purchased Anthony Robbins cds for many years and was surprised to find that what I thought was going to be new material was a dissapointing rehash of previous cds! I already have all this information. However, if you are a beginner to this work, it will be great for you as it combines two interviews instead of one, onto one cd. I was only dissapointed because I thought it would be full of new stuff and the very latest information so that I could take it to the next levl.",1221955200,4,482,4.25
