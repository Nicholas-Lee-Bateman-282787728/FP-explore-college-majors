1586401,5,B00005JRMX,"My favorite movie that has Norman Reedus in it! ending is beautiful, this film is underrated which is a shame it is so good!!!",1385510400,,126,4.291666666666667
1586402,4,B00005JRMX,"This is a really good movie...i mean,good intentions gone awry,somehow. Luke Wilson was a bit boring and unemotional. But Norman Reedus gives a great performance,as usual.",1182124800,5,171,5.615384615384615
1586403,2,B00005JRMX,"Oh, my God! This is one of the most idiotic movies I've ever seen, and I'm not prejudiced. It's advertised as a psychological thriller with a message, but I haven't seen any psychology or thriller or message here. First, the film is full of plot holes and they are not unnoticeable - they jump into your eyes! The acting is very poor (except Dennis Farina) although Luke Wilson is a good actor and I used to see him in good pictures. The storyline itself is very hitchy, different things happen that are difficult to understand (I mean motivation), characters' behaviour is also totally unmotivated. I'm not going to retell some scenes not to spoil them for you, although there's practically nothing to spoil here, I'll just give you some examples.
As the movie goes, guy #1 is chasing guy #2 willing to kill him. At certan point guy #2 starts chasing guy #1 and the latter tries to escape. Why?! He just wanted to catch and kill guy #2! During the other persuit guy #1 is firing his gun at guy #2 being at a long distance. He misses. Then, when he's at arms length, he doesn't shoot. Why? There's no chance to miss! In another scene two of them arrange a rendezvous at a remote gas station at night. Guy #2 knows that guy #1 wants to kill him. They meet, guy #1 has a tire lever in his hand. If you were guy #2 would you turn your back on him? I guess not, it's stupid, but apparently guy #2 doesn't think so... Then one guy's clothes is sopping with gasoline and the other chases him with a lighter. He throws the lighter and the other guy's clothes ignites. I doubt that, if thrown, a lighter (even Zippo) doesn't extinguish itself, and even if it doesn't, I doubt you can ignit a person throwing a lighter from ten or fifteen yards. Dennis Farina's character is a very harsh and impudent private investigator who'd make his own mother pay him for preparing coffee for her. You wouldn't expect some warm attitude from him toward other people. But suddenly we see his character is a very sympathetic person who wants to help Luke Wilson with open arms. Why? I didn't see him changing slowly. Just in a blink of an eye he turned out to be caring and kind person. And such episodes happen throughout the whole movie. I was asking myself all the time: why? is that possible? how did he do that? what for? along with many other questions.
I felt like the movie was falling apart in front of my eyes, it seemed so impotent and helpless. Maybe it was a good story once in the head of the director, but he proved himself to be absolutely uncapable to put it on celluloid. And the worst thing is that the picture tries to be something more than just ordinary thriller, it tries to seem thoughtful and serious work. But it can't. It's just like elementary school pupils decided to stage some serious play and - yes, they are doing it with all their seriousness, but to us it all looks just hilarious. Hence it leaves the feeling of a terrible disappointment.
The only reason I kept watching it to the end was Dennis Farina. He was like a glue, trying to stick all the parts of the movie together and working for everybody else involved. He's a brilliant, extremely talented actor, real professional, it was a true pleasure to watch him here, but sometimes I felt pity for him, because he somehow wound up being in this horrendous film. I think Farina is the only reason also why I gave the movie two stars. If it was not for him, there'd be one for sure.",1135555200,6,3447,4.4043887147335425
1586404,4,B00005JRMX,"BAD SEED is one dark movie, complex and intriguing in its concept.  Luke Wilson plays Preston Tilton, a man who discovers his wife is having an affair; after an argument, he comes home and finds her dead.  Wilson is sure that her cast off lover, played by Norman Reedus, is the culprit.  He finds out where Reedus lives, and after breaking in, is attacked and ends up killing the ex-lover.  Wrong!  He has killed the lover's retarded brother instead.  Loverboy has a videotape of Wilson committing this murder, and from there, we are spun into a brooding and complex maze of mystery.  Wilson does okay in the role, but there are key scenes where he seems to be struggling with his character; Reedus is almost too sleazy to be credible as a lover; but, and this is a big but..DENNIS FARINA steals the movie as PI Dick, who helps Wilson find out the truth.  Farina brings a lot of passion and conviction to a role that could have been secondary.  But as the movie winds down, Farina's performance is what keeps the movie floating.  A no-compromise ending also makes this a different film.
Interesting and worth a view.",1080172800,8,1116,4.590909090909091
1586405,3,B00005JRMX,"The concept of this film deals with what a normal person would do under extreme circumstances.  In this case what would you do if your spouse has an affair and is then murdered.  Luke Wilson gives a nice performance as Preston husband of the murdered woman.  He plays Preston as a well rounded character never too nice and never going too far over the top as to make it unbeleiveable.  Denis Farina also gives a great performance and he and Wilson work well together.  The best thing about this film is the relationship between Preston and Jonathan played by Norman Reedus.  Both characters remain realistic throughout their extrodinary situations.  This DVD is worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of Luke Wilson or, the director, Jon Bokenkamp.  There is a very interesting and entertaining commentary track with Wilson and Bokenkamp as well as a production featurette and behind the scenes production photos.  There is also a second commentary track with Bokenkamp and the producer, but I have yet to listen to it.",1012262400,8,1028,4.862068965517241
1586406,4,B00005JRMX,"Highly simplistic storyline made into a damn good ""B"" movie! Preston's wife Emily has an affair with Jonathan and from there on, EVERYTHING goes wrong! At times, this movie has that ""L.A. Confidential pulp-type"" feel to it which make it quite right especially when Preston goes to visit a private investigator. He turns out to be, well, let's say, not too conventional in his techniques. A non-Hollywood ending which, of course, will give it that ""flop"" status. Could be better but I must commend Jon Bokenkamp on his efforts. Flick stars Luke Wilson, Norman Reedus, Dennis Farina & Mili Avital. Worth a watch!",994809600,7,610,4.932038834951456
1586487,1,B00005JRMX,"I normally don't bother leaving reviews on movies, but this movie was terrible!! The storyline does not make any sense, most of the scenes are very unrealistic, and overall you are left completely unsatisfied. Big thumbs down!",1502755200,,226,5.135135135135135
1586488,2,B00005JRMX,"This is an older film. The quality is poor.....Fuzzy like an old film. The story is unremarkable.
Luke Wilson is a great actor, but the director didn't do him justice. Actors have a craft. It is up to the director
to get that talent out of the actor. He didn't. Move on to better movie.",1502496000,,286,4.218181818181818
1586489,5,B00005JRMX,So happy I got this on the cheap side. Thank you. What a great movie.,1502323200,,69,3.6666666666666665
1586490,2,B00005JRMX,One minute the bad guy is chasing the so-called good guy then vise versus.  Its an ok movie if you are bored.,1501632000,,109,3.9545454545454546
1586491,3,B00005JRMX,"It was a decent movie, but the title alone makes no sense.  3 stars is actually being pretty generous.",1501459200,,102,4.368421052631579
1586492,3,B00005JRMX,"Better than I thought it would be. I watched it mainly to see Norman Reedus, but Luke Wilson and Dennis Farina were excellent as well. I don't see what the title has to do with the movie, unless (SPOILER ALERT) it refers to the fact the Norman Reedus' character hit his brother on the head when he was seven, injuring him so badly he was severely mentally challenged after that. (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT) It would seem to me that would make Reedus' character the ""bad seed"", but it was the brother who actually committed the murder, so... ??? The ending was strange and unnecessary. Surely Luke Wilson's character would have told them who actually killed his wife, so why would the police be so hot to find the older brother, whose only crime was having an adulterous affair? Come to think of it, maybe this really wasn't better than I thought it would be. The acting is much better than the story. Guess that's what I'm trying to say.",1501372800,,931,4.514792899408284
1586493,1,B00005JRMX,"Positively one of the worst movies ever made, produced, or written. None of the scenes are even remotely believable or well acted. I wanted to turn this off after 5 minutes but kept hoping for something redeeming in the flick but squandered an hour and a half of time. Don't do the same.",1500940800,,287,4.433962264150943
1586494,5,B00005JRMX,"It was great to see 3 good actors together in this, Norman Reedus, Luke Wilson and Denis Farina. Turned out it was the brother after all.",1500854400,,137,4.3076923076923075

1586496,3,B00005JRMX,"I found the movie watchable. It had a little different twist to it. The very end made no sense to me at all. The acting was ok, there was a lot of mistakes made in it, life just does not work that way.",1499731200,,201,3.697674418604651
1586537,1,B00005JRMX,"This movie threw together so many ""climax elements"" from the beginning that it seemed all forced and just horrible. I knew in the first :08 minutes that when it the antagonist Jonathan came on the scene so heavy and early, you had to wonder where is the movie going to go from here? It was all downhill from there. The only reason I even completed the movie after 10 minutes was because my girlfriend insisted. Don't waste your time. It got 20% on Rotten Tomatoes. That you should tell you everything you need to know.",1499558400,,518,4.463157894736842

1586541,4,B00005JRMX,I appreciated that the picture was 16:9. The audio was not 5.1 surround but the widescreen aspect was more important to me. The action and violence was adequate for my enjoyment. This movie was more emotional than I have seen in awhile. That felt good. The story was different and I really liked it.,1499126400,,299,4.555555555555555

1586546,1,B00005JRMX,"What a bad movie!  Terrible acting, worse cinematography, gormless story. Just horrible.  The script never established that the Luke Wilson cared more for his wife then for his umbrella, for starters, so why did he go after Jonathan? And, therefore, why the rest of the film?
I stopped watching after the part where Wilson, Dennis Farina, and Jonathan are in the car (going where?) and Jonathan grabs Farina's gun.  The scene could have been resolved quickly had Wilson merely taken his foot off the accelerator, but, I suppose, for the sake of drama, he didn't. Go figure. I have no curiosity about the end, only regret over time lost.",1498867200,6,636,4.81651376146789

7942183,1,B00005JRMX,"This is still a pretty lame movie.

So, what've we got her?  I submit that we have two decidedly un-stellar performances for the price of one: on the one hand, there's Luke Wilson's character who's looking a lot more like he's got a bad case of hemorrhoids than some guy whose cheating wife has just been murdered; and on the other hand, there's Farina's eminently forgettable character who seems to have walked in straight off the set of a Cheech and Chong movie.  But for the fact that it is like the two men are acting in two entirely different movies, this might have had the makings of a pretty entertaining buddy flick.

This film is color by numbers from the opening scene, chewing gum for the eyes.  I added a star because I found myself cracking up a few times, although I think this was rather in spite of the director than by design.",1517702400,,844,4.419354838709677

The story isn't bad, but besides confirming that Reedus has always been adorable and helping me scratch the itch created by Boondock Saints not being available to stream on Prime, this movie was not life changing but worth watching.",1510012800,,364,4.887096774193548
