8036264,3,B0004Z351C,"I like the subject matter.  The audio is alright .  My dvd disc was very poor quality  video.  It is like watching a well worn vhs tape.  I paid near 15 dollars  for it and  5 or 6  dollars  would be  a good price.  Says copyright 1998.  I  like the wide angle shot on Stonehenge  but the definition through out the  program  is so poor  that  it is a distraction.  The art work on the dvd box has an image of  a panel  in Abydos  temple and i did not see that  in the program.  That art work is misleading , since it is not part of the presentation.  That art work  helped lead me to order  the dvd.
It needs a do over  with  cameras  that have  higher resolution.  I watched it on a 70 inch HD TV  and  it  was  so poor, some text could not be read.
Ending this review with the way it started,  I like the subject  and  I think it has merit.  I think ropes and slaves  are right there with a rabbit hiding colorful hen eggs.

8036266,5,B0004Z351C,I have been researching esotericism for almost four decades and this is one of the more magnificent educational films that points to the inexplicable accomplishments of those ancient sages that endeavored to pass on their mystical knowledge.  I have watched this film a number of times on VHS and am now purchasing the DVD.  There are few books and films I cherish above others but this film hold a special place in my collection.  We need more films and books like this.  Few indeed there are that have the stemina and fortitude that John Mitchell has to wade through the naysayers of the world.  The producers of this film should be given the highest awards in the field.  John Mitchell and the compilers of this material obviously have a great understanding of what mysticism and esotericism is all about and if it was not for their producing this film there is much I would have missed in my own researches.  I give the highest praise possible to John Mitchell and his team and recommend it to all that need evidence of a mystical life achieved by others.,1302307200,,1059,4.6310160427807485
8036267,5,B0004Z351C,"I thought it was a great production and caused me to rethink how the ancients craved stone works with astonding results.  The idea is that we could not do as well without using modern ultrasonic tools! This DVD cause me to do more reading. One of which I am reading presently - Chapter 2 Ancient Technology in ""Discovering the Mysteries of Ancient America"" by Frank Joseph

Talking heads?  These are real people not toy heads sorry reality can't always be done on a Holywood production set folks.

Buy this DVD and see it for yourself!",1156032000,11,535,4.6
8036268,1,B0004Z351C,"Most of the movie is either talking heads or irrelevant slide show (of course, Egypt, South America etc.), and sometimes talking heads with irrelevant background. Say, a man walking on some indescriptive street and a voice behind tells who is he or what have he told some time ago.

Plenty of accusations to the ""official science"" that they don't listen to a reason and don't want any proofs. Not much of actual proofs. It reminds me mostly amateurish informercial where participants pitching how great they are before pithing the product (in this case, their books, probably).

The only plausible proof of their point that I heard in the movie was that many stones are done with a machinery precision, impossible manually. However, they were too busy complaining about ""official science"" and pitching how great they are to really demonstrate this machine precision.",1137628800,12,866,5.091549295774648
