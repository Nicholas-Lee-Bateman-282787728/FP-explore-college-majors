8238149,5,B0010PLIUU,"Captain Lou was without a doubt, one of the planet's greatest athletes, managers, and promoters of Super Stars of all time !
 I have not seen this cd, as I sent it to My Nephew for Christmas. However, I think I recall seeing the interview on cable. (He was awesome)
  Lou Albano also appeared in the Movie ' Wise Guys' as Frankie the Fixer, for which He should have won an Oscar !  He also managed
 Cyndi Lauper's carreer, when She was still a budding flower in the music business! I hope You enjoy My 'tongue in cheek' review.
 But,,, Captain Lou was VERY, VERY entertaining!  ""Merry Christmas""!",1450569600,,596,4.462962962962963
