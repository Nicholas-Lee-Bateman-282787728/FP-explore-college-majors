5125566,5,B0083SI99K,"I can't wait to watch all of Sinnoh League Victors! Even though they don't make complete season box sets, you can buy these sets. However, these I find are not as of a reasonable price. Think about it, you are spending about $50  ($45 for the sets plus shipping and tax) for I think 36 episodes, when you can buy the previous bigger box sets (Battle Dimension, Galactic Battles) with around 52 episodes for the same price. I tried to wait until these sets went on a lower sale price, but still no change. Black and White sets 1 and 2 you can buy for cheaper and those sets are newer and have the same amount of episodes like these sets. So I think it's a rip off, but if you want to complete your collection, like me, go for it.

If you buy box sets 1, 2 and 3, then you will have all of Sinnoh League Victors. On here, Amazon lists them as ""Sets""  which is fine. Get all 3 sets and that's all of this season. If you are a Pokemon fan and enjoy the anime and want to complete some dvd box sets, buy these. So enjoy!

Also, if you have Pokemon Indigo League (3 box sets), Orange Islands (1 box set), Master Quest (2 box sets), Advanced (2 box sets), Battle Frontier (2 box sets), and Diamond and Pearl (3 box sets), Battle Dimension (3 box sets), Galactic Battles ( 4 box sets) then you must have a lot of shelf room because all together these box sets do take up a lot of space. Once when you buy these sets, you will save space because they are thinner (normal dvd size). Even Black and White seasons are the same as these sets.",1358035200,2,1529,4.120805369127517
