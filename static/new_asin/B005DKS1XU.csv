8467023,4,B005DKS1XU,"I saw this documentary on Investigation Discovery TV.  Its amazing that  Willie Pickton wasn't prosecuted years earlier than 2007.  The authorities had their chance in 1997 when he attempted to handcuff and murder prostitute Wendy Lynn Eistetter, who escaped.  The authorities decided not to prosecute him because Wendy was a drug user, and might not be believed in court.  If they had just done a little searching on his property at that time, they could have saved about 40 lives over the next 10 years.
Take a look at Wikipedia's page on Robert Pickton.  (Robert William ""Willie"" Pickton)",1424822400,,591,4.979591836734694

8467026,4,B005DKS1XU,"If you are looking for a true crime case that unfolds with an eye towards honoring the victims in the case, this is a good one. I have studied both film and criminal justice, and all that it entails, and usually what I come across in terms of the true crime movie or show is something that glorifies the violence and perpetrator(s). I have always been more interested in the case that is studied using actual clues, leads, and witness statements - and ""the Pig Farm"" does exactly that. You hear directly from people who lived and worked with the suspect, learning about the case in a way that dignifies the victims and lets you into the mind of the perpetrator, without celebrating the ugliness of the crimes themselves. A solid good telling!",1357344000,,742,4.586466165413534
