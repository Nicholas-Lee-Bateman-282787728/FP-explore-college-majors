2883653,5,B000S8CLT2,Bought this for my grandkids who can no longer see this show on TV.  I and they love it.  Wish we could still watch it!,1352764800,,119,3.72
2883654,5,B000S8CLT2,All about friendship and taking adventures together. The big friend 'beast' is very enchanting and funny. This series is similar to Clifford the Big Red Dog in that the little girl has a 'super-sized' friend and they go on adventures learning about each other and deepening their friendships.,1315612800,,292,5.104166666666667
2883655,5,B000S8CLT2,My little one loves Maggie and I am so glad we found it.  It was in perfect condition and we don't leave hoem without it.,1313712000,,121,3.84
2883656,5,B000S8CLT2,"my daughter just loves maggie and the ferocious beast.  It is hard to find on tv though, so this video, with multiple episodes, is a life saver.",1292112000,,144,4.333333333333333
2883657,4,B000S8CLT2,"Maggie and the Ferocious Beast is wonderful - my 3 year old daughter loves it and my 7 year old daughter will occasionally watch it with her as well (it's more enduring than Elmo in other words). This was a good DVD but I think some others in the series are a little better because this one has a lot of episodes from when the series first started and they got better over time. However, it is not a bad buy and my daughter has still enjoyed it.",1231977600,,445,4.068181818181818
2883658,5,B000S8CLT2,"Having watched this series on Noggin, I purchased this DVD for my daughter.  She really like the series, and there is no reason to think that this DVD is anything but perfect.  Great diversity in episodes, the only thing I think is unusual is the format where there is 90 minutes of Maggie, but broken up into 4 ""episodes"" of 3 skits each.  Not a big deal, just thought it was unusual when you go to repeat it - it is only 3 of the 12.",1227225600,,435,4.034883720930233
2883659,5,B000S8CLT2,"Maggie is an intrepid 5 year old girl with a strong mind of her own. If that's not enough to get you interested in this series, then the fact that she creates and reads maps, has a menagerie of imaginary friends, and deals with everyday issues with grace and humor should do it. The pacing, script (by originator Betty Paraskevas) and story lines are perfect for preschoolers. This is a great gift choice for young children. We know a little boy who's obsessed with Maggie and her adventures in Nowhere Land.",1192492800,6,508,4.593406593406593

2883663,5,B000S8CLT2,"I've always loved Maggie and The Ferocious Beast, I used to watch it when I was growing up, and it's still one of my favorites. My brother had a baby girl last year, and she is now one year old. I bought this for her for Christmas, and I'm positive that she will love it the way that I do.
