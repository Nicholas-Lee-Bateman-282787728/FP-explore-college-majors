4093188,5,B00395ATT0,"After ordering and viewing seasons one and two, we couldn't wait for the release of season three.  We've ordered several BBC series, but this is our favorite.  We will truly miss our evenings watching episodes of Lark Rise to Candleford.  Like any series, we have episodes that we like better than others; but overall, this is a five star.",1286755200,,339,4.711864406779661
4093189,5,B00395ATT0,"Larkrise to Candleford Season 3 is of the same impeccable quality as the previous seasons.  The characters are utterly believeable, the stories are rich and intriguing, and the cinematography, scenery and costuming are second to none.  A delightfully satisfying series!",1286582400,,269,5.7
4093190,3,B00395ATT0,"OK, I continue to watch the series, but: It's become transparently a soap opera, constantly working hard to jerk as many tears and ""aaaaaawwwwwws"" from the audience as possible.  In every episode, there is a conflict presented between family members, or between other people, or the community of Lark Rise versus that of Candleford. And each and every episode is very predictably resolved with warm hugs and wise utterances all around.  Many of the wise utterances come straight from the modern therapist's office; ones like ""This isn't about you, it's about me."" However, some of the scriptwriters are channeling Dickens; one of them actually lifted the scene in Great Expectations where the convict threatens Pip to get him to bring food, including only a minor rewrite of Dickens' dialog.  Someone's usually in deep trouble or dying or something, and everyone (including, by inference, the viewers), hangs around and weeps for extended periods.  Even more than in previous series, the work of different scriptwriters renders the episodes discontinuous. In Series 2, Alf acquired a girlfriend, with a sentimental burying of old grudges between Lark Rise and some other hamlet never before mentioned. Now the girlfriend is gone, with no explanation--and so is the other hamlet. In one Series 3 episode, Twister somehow acquires the object of his dreams: A still. Even though it must have cost a lot of money by his standards, and furthermore, would be a source of urgently needed income or at least free booze, the still vanishes after that one episode, with no explanation. For awhile all this is made acceptable by pretty good acting, folk songs, and the golden glow on the fields (they must have used a yellow filter). But after awhile it becomes too treacly, and after that it becomes ridiculous. In other words, watch only one episode, or at the most two, per evening.

One tidbit of info: The series theme music is a Polish folk dance.",1285977600,18,1942,4.981481481481482
4093191,5,B00395ATT0,"My family and I have so enjoyed this season as well!  We even find the intricate woven story lines to be more fascinating than in the previous 2 seasons.  Stellar performances by all as we learn more and more about our favorite characters.  We are so very grateful for this good, clean family viewing.  It's such a good learning tool to 'see' a little of history being played out.  Seeing the gleaners using scythes and making the sheaths of grain was very cool.  The plight of dealing with a measles outbreak during the harvest, etc. etc. Top notch entertaining and learning at the same time!",1285804800,2,593,4.6
4093192,2,B00395ATT0,"Not withstanding rave reviews, because of which I bought this series, I must object. The postman charactor was so bad as to make one disc all I could watch before I put the whole thing up for resale. Stupid is the only way I can chatactorise the way this role was written. Unbelievable is another word as the rest of the story line is quite good. The female roles are well done and the photography-location is excellent.",1285113600,7,420,4.467532467532467
4093193,4,B00395ATT0,"I love the series overall, but, though the individual stories are quite good, BBC's third season budget cuts show -- in too many episodes, major characters are 'out of town' so as to save the pence for hiring that actor for that episode.  To me the third series was therefore not quite as rich as the first two, but still well worth seeing, and heads above the usual TV rubbish.",1284249600,28,378,4.4
4093194,5,B00395ATT0,"This masterful Victorian Britain series has equaled, or bettered, ""Little House on the Prairie."" English country life at a poetic, pictorial, and enchanting peak. Lives of those living in Lark Rise and Candleford mingle as delicately and wonderfully as frosting on a bridal cake. Even the DVD's music puts a sanguine sugarcoating on the period.
4 DVDs, 12 episodes, about 12 hours, all 1800s awesome. Subtitled. It is romance, nostalgia, saga, suspense, drama, well...it's a cornucopia of viewing that is not to be missed. Especially for the folks who have already sat through seasons 1 & 2, it continues with a great and large nucleus cast, but the stories and depth of characters are growing with the show's movement.

Julia Sawalha (`Return to Cranford') as Dorcas continues as a major player, the postmistress of Candleford, but how long can she keep the postal position? Claudie Blakley (also of `Return to Cranford') as Emma, work well together, both with female roles that show a modern worthiness of women, but without hurting the period setting of the series. Her devoted husband, Robert (Brendan Coyle) delightful marriage interaction between the two, gives way from some of the Timmins family emphasis, to the advancement of Emma. Even though the show offers these 21 century tendencies, it harms nothing of the charm and warmth of a perfection of Victorian set, costume, and attitude that this show, now in year 3 has become known for. Jane Austin would have loved this show. And Catherine Cookson too, although most of Lark Rise and Candleford are less brutal than the commoners and towns of Cookson's adapted works.

Journalist, Daniel Parish (Ben Aldridge) arrives in town which leads to several situations for locals. Viewers will confront measles, witchcraft, bribes, pregnancy, beggars to inheritants, romance, rivalries, and multiple job-insecurity issues. Life. Life as we see now, and life in the 1880s. Amazing writing. Riveting dialogue.

Also, be warned. Expect belly laughs too. Those Pratt sisters, Twister (OK tears too) and wife, Queenie, not to mention, Thomas the Bible-quoting, bike-riding, mail-deliverer, and his wife, Margaret (all returning regulars) could put together a comedy show every bit as good as this dramatic series has been--from day one. There is an abundance of fine British dramatic programming available, but this has to be one of my favorite.

It's very comparable to ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" in that it is a continuing family struggle 1800s adventure, and hopefully the lady postmistress will survive as long as the lady doctor did. The end of episode 12 does lend itself to continuation, thankfully. I do SO RECOMMEND ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" series 1 and 2 as well. It is all fantastic 5-star good.",1281312000,42,2756,5.158836689038031
4093195,5,B00395ATT0,"Thanks to a friend who lives in England, I was able to watch Season 3 of LRtC a couple of months ago, but I have been patiently awaiting the DVD release here in the United States (it took them long enough!). I have been a faithful fan of LRtC since Season One and just love this period drama centered on the inhabitants of the hamlet of Lark Rise and the town of Candleford. The casting is excellent, with a talented ensemble cast who add real depth to the characters portrayed, the stories are generally interesting with real human drama with all the pains and joys experienced by the inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford, and the cinematography is simply breathtaking.

Season Three sees the introduction of a significant new character, Daniel Parrish (played by Ben Aldridge), a young journalist who arrives in Lark Rise with some life-altering news for the Timmins. Emma (Claudie Blakley) might inherit a fortune, and both Emma and her husband Robert (Brendan Coyle) ponder the possibilities and opportunities this signifies for them as a family. Parrish is also drawn to Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) who has matured into a true beauty, but still harbors heartache from the break-up with clockmaker Fisher Price in Season 2.

The independent and strong-willed Dorcas Lane (played by the talented and lovely Julia Sawalha) continues as Candleford's postmistress, and experiences some human drama of her own, taking on a role that she finds fulfills her immensely. Unlike previous seasons, Dorcas' story is no longer the only dominant thread this season, as other characters begin to get more screen time (yes, I was not too pleased with this, but I felt some of these stories were still well done). One story arc which I particularly enjoyed watching was the marital adventures of postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) and his devoted wife Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade). Their antics just make me laugh out loud, and yet there is also a poignancy to their marriage which is explored later in the season. This balance makes them an interesting couple to watch on-screen and the actors outdo themselves in lending credibility and depth to their characters.

Minnie, the bumbling yet lovable maid from Season 2 is given a meatier role this season, and I loved how Dorcas takes Minnie under her wing, grooming her not for a life of servitude but for something far more worthy and fulfilling, with mixed results - a blend of hilarity and poignancy that had me laughing one moment and tearing up the next.

Strong and resilient Emma Timmins also gets a chance to explore other sides to her role - she is not just a loving mother and loyal wife this season, but yearns to be something more which I felt rounded-out her character very nicely this season. One of the story arcs I've loved throughout seasons 1-3 is the strong bond of love between Robert and Emma Timmins, one which is further explored this season.

The Pratt sisters, Ruby and Pearl (Victoria Hamilton and Matilda Zeigler) continue their roles as town busybodies and this season sees a major upheaval which threatens the sisters formerly close knit bond with each other. Young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh, also one of my favorite characters after Dorcas and Robert) begins to mature into his role as the head of his family, assuming real responsibilities, but also faces some serious and heartbreaking challenges.

This season also sees the inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford coming together in times of crisis, helping each other out, and setting aside their differences which I felt was timely and touching. The stories make you feel like you're there, experiencing these people's joys and pains, their triumphs and failures, and the slowly developing sense of community between both hamlets.

There are many other story threads this season that will engage viewers and keep them riveted to the screen. Is Season Three as good as Seasons 1 & 2? Well, on some counts yes, and others no, but the talented ensemble cast puts together another charming and poignant season to please viewers in general. I only hope Season 4 is a reality and that BBC continues making this wonderful period drama!",1280102400,175,4159,4.915954415954416

4093197,5,B00395ATT0,"I love this program -- it's sweet and endearing in a way similar to Little House on the Prairie, with many coming-of-age or heartfelt story lines with little ""wisdom"" talks (just like on LHOTP), but instead all taking place in Edwardian England.  Set in a small British village and hamlet, it intertwines that stories of middleclass (tradesmen) to working class (peasant/agrarian) folk.  It's all ""told"" in a very innocent style, and more than a bit idealized.
 One unique feature is that the women dominate the series as strong leads, both as heroines of their own lives (many lightly feminist plots), and as the center of all the stories.  For me, the men are all secondary characters as they affect or relate to the women's character arcs. Even though we know that this time period was still one of heavy ""feminine"" oppression, there are small signs of dissent and liberation amongst the women (as would still be appropriate for the time and place), and which would have begun reverberating at the turn of the 20th century, as depicted here.

My greatest complaint about the show is Thomas, who works in the Post Office.  I feel he is an obnoxious, ridiculous man-child as a character, exaggerated even more so by the actor's excessively stupid, childish, and affected portrayal, and who brings nothing but tedium to every scene he is in.  His screen-wife on occasions has the same effect.  However, most series seem to suffer from such annoying, exaggerated characters that could never exist in real life (a 50-year virgin afraid to even bed his own wife?), so it seems one must endure.  ;-)  Sigh... All in all, a lovely series.  For me, the most tiresome characters besides these two are Laura and Twister.  I thought Laura was meant to be the lead (and barely made it through the first episode as a result), but I'm happy to report it's Dorcas Lane instead who is the lead (played beautifully by Julia Sawalha), and who steals the show.  Compared to LHOTP, Dorcas is the local version of ""Pa"" Ingalls, and just like him being the helpful, kind, problem-fixing, ideal ""parent"" to her ""family"" and ever-doling out drops of wisdom.  A nice way to pass the time and I can usually watch a couple of episodes back to back.",1495929600,2,2223,4.755208333333333

The characters--and their personalities and individual story lines--are very engaging, but also far from perfect.  I suppose I should be happy to realize that they do have human foibles, but I found myself bothered by the constant pouting, lip-biting, and other facial dramatics (just watch Laura and Dorcas both as they react to different situations); the appearance of the strange woman, Enid; Laura's fickle-heartedness; Emma Timmin's quick temper and judgmental attitude, etc.  My initial excitement over the series started to wane.",1483574400,,714,5.463636363636364

It is a great show with likeable characters (mostly) with an optimistic outlook and writing seldom found in our dark society.  I found it a joy to watch and was only sad that the BBC only made 3 full seasons and sold the viewers short on the fourth with 6 episodes that were not up to the other seasons.  None the less, I love the show and can find little to compare it to.  Hopeful and about family, love, friendship, and the bonds of people over time that hold things together.

Strong, interesting and unpredictable female characters are so hard to find, Miss Lane was a bastion of wisdom and I love that sort of story line...how true wisdom solves problems. I also love how over the top the language and mannerims are, so funny!! The spells of dizziness, the breathiness, the funny things people say, the false superiority of some, the emotional outbursts of men and women, were very fun to watch. Then the history of the period, contrasted by the plainer folks of the small hamlet Lark Rise, and the fancier folk of the town of Candleford, were very informative. I loved the writing that was read aloud by Laura, at the beginning and end of each episode. I wish there were more series to watch and more series like this! Plus the setting of the Post Office...I am the chairperson of Penland Post Office Project, raising funds to save a Post Office in NC. The building was built by my great grandparents and the PO has been on their land since 1879. It has been in continuous operation since then!

4093492,3,B00395ATT0,"(I would of liked to have given this a 3 1/2 but don't know how to do that.) Always looking for a Victorian period movie, I came across this series accidentally and decided to watch and continued to, to its end.  This short British series (4 seasons), takes place during the Victorian era, and is about the ordinary life and lives of the people in the hamlet of Lark Rise and its counterpart, the larger, more developed and more sophisticated town of Candleford.

In Lark Rise there are people with specific skills, from farming to masonry, business and leadership and those of the arts (poets, singers and artists) and always one, usually a woman, who is gifted with mystical and natural talents, often a type of sage (a person with wisdom) and the busybody, as well as the unwilling. This series has its fill of human experiences in these and especially in drama: poor people trying to survive off the land, even when crops fail, finding wages to fill bellies, romances that begin and end, disappointment with life's harsh realities in a small community, dreams fulfilled and lost, being young and industrious, getting old, and less able, yet with strong hopes of maintaining their simple way of life.

The family, the land and neighbors are all that there is and they work hard. The main cast of characters created here are all endearing, showing  how they relied on each other to cope from day to day and to enjoy the good times, together. As in other series, the eccentricities and strength of the English comes through, but I found this one better than many of them; this one has good writing and good character portrayals. And, whatever comes, whether disaster or disappointment, you hope for something better, but if it doesn't come, they still have each other.

Candleford is the large town not too far away. Here life is progessive, having higher class stores and bigger, more businesses, more economically prosperous, and better technology for homes: phones, lights, etc. This contrast separates and clearly defines class distinctions, yet for some, offer incentives for changing lives.",1481760000,,2097,4.895774647887324

By season 3 I was over the show n had to force myself to finish the rest.. Alfie character was by far best character on it; was happy when they gave him a beautiful love interest then just like that she's gone with no explanation..He ended up with Minnie..

At first I thought the Christian postman might be a typical negative portrayal of Christians as I have found to be the case in many of today's programs. At first he comes off as very judgmental, inflexible, and downright weird! However, in time, you see that he is very well-meaning, and quite sensitive. As a Christian, I find that refreshing.
There are tears, humor, and so much to relate to on so many different levels. I am enjoying it thoroughly!",1475107200,,543,4.838709677419355

4093910,4,B00395ATT0,"I would give it a 4.5 if I knew how to create star fractions. 4.5 because I am sick and tired of zombies, monsters, bad aliens, blood, pointless sex, historical ""reconstructions"" which do not go farther than the costumes, jumping the shark, Nth version of a blockbuster and in general, TV series which assume the viewer is a drooling moron.
Not 5? People in Lark Rise and Candleford are just too good to be true and turn into (certainly)unwitting British propaganda agents. We should be given the credit that we can afford a little more evil in the British world and it won't affect our opinion of the British, even after the Brexit.
Just too demonstrate in what esteem I hold this serie, I have refused to binge it: I want it to last as long as possible and never watch more than two episodes in a row.
As a reference to allow potential viewers to assess my opinion, my personal (current) choices are 1)Weeds, 2) The Newsroom, 3)Orphan Black and Outlander 4) Dr Martin, Lark Rise to Candleford, and Poldark.

I like that the not so nice characters with their malicious little games get their just rewards  very quickly unlike what happens today in the series on TV.  Downton Abbey was the same and that's one reason I loved it.  I'm tired of people not being held responsible for wrongdoings and untruths.

You'll also recognize some of the actors from these shows as well. The story evolves around the people who live in these two towns, with Lark Rise the more rural and humble of the two. It is told from the standpoint of Laura, an assistant to the postmistress of Candleford, Dorcas Lane. Laura's parents and family live in Lark Rise. Most of the drama begins in the post office, where we meet the characters and see their lives enfold. Too bad it only ran four seasons. I'll miss it.",1471564800,,652,4.487394957983193

4094054,4,B00395ATT0,"This is such a beautifully done show.  I really enjoy the storylines and characters.  My only issue with the show is the overt advocating of Darwinism/atheism/Paganism and mocking of Christianity.  The reasonable and logical characters are all non-religious and occasionally mention Darwin being on their bookshelf and similar remarks.  The one devout Christian is a zealot with absolutely no concept of forgiveness or compassion.  He is often almost out of his mind when he sees anyone doing anything that isn't completely according to the Good Book. I have no problem with any of these different faiths, but the show goes out of its way to depict Christians as nutty simpletons.  It is bigoted to target ANY faith.  I think the show would have been so much better without the obvious biases.",1470700800,,793,5.00763358778626

Told with a bit of drama and humor, it takes place circa 1880 and explores the relationship between the citizens of  the town of Candleford, and the farming community of Lark Rise - a relationship similar to bickering siblings.  For those looking for a sweet story at the end of a weary day, this series just may fill that void.",1468540800,,488,4.449438202247191

I think you will be captured by the visuals, the fun, the emotions, the lives of people dealing with each and change, etc.
I especially like the fact that the main thread of each episode's story is pretty much tied up by the end of that episode. So, while there is some continuation, you are rarely left hanging at the end of a show. Well done, BBC!

I most especially enjoy not having to listen to vulgar language, and nudity. Real life isn't all crazy, and full of fast cars, or fast women. Real life ought to be slowed down a bit to enjoy, just as Lark Rise to Candleford portrays. I do hope there are more seasons to come soon. I'm almost done with what is being shown so far, on Amazon Prime. Hoping there's more of season 4, and hopefully a season 5 to come yet.

Marvelous acting, loved all the characters, loved the fact that it had quality, no profanities, no nudity, no forgettable music, no sex. In other words, all the cheap tricks that are used in so many shows that the makers of these shows think it's something everyone wants to see, how wrong they are.
Keep creating more shows like this one.

More slowly paced than some programs, but that  adds to the charm. Many great characters, as well as some faces you might know from other British shows, like Downton Abbey. It is addictive.

4094931,5,B00395ATT0,"Lark Rise to Candleford is an excellent BBC series that depicts life in the small villages in the countryside near Oxford near the close of the 19th Century.  It was a transitional era for both the aristocratic and land controlling gentry were confronted with technological and social transformation, and the changing roles of the poor tenant farmers and craftspeople who struggle to make a living.  At the heart of the story are the two villages--Lark Rise and Candlford.  Lark Rise is a poor village, simply houses for tenants who work the fields and do the crafts, often facing the critical day of paying the rent.  Candleford is the small village with emerging commerce, a hotel, a newspaper, a post office, a dress shop.  The characters of Dorcas, Laura, Queenie, Twister, Daniel, among many others become memorable.  Also emerging is the changing role of women, of strong women, at the start of the societal transformation into the 20th Century.  Lark Rise to Candleford tells human stories with humor and sensitivity in much the same way that the BBC production of Downton Abbey continues the transformations in the 20th Century.",1462665600,3,1136,5.01063829787234

In those days the mail was delivered twice a day and it center role emphasizes communication unfolds. As the season enfolds we see the development of the individuals as they face the burgeoning industrialization of a beautiful bucolic thatched roof 'wee' cottage village and the larger community nearby.

4095030,5,B00395ATT0,"Loved this series!  This review is on the whole series, not just season 3.  I was sad when I got to the last episode.  The characters are believable, with excellent acting.  I found some scenes to be a little out of time; the displays of affection (kissing) and unchaperoned meetings between two people of the opposite sex seemed not accurate for that time period.  I adored all of the spunky, outspoken women.  The humor was subtle, usually just an expression on a character's face, but enough to make me laugh.  Some of my favorites are Ruth Pratt, for her expressions, Queenie, for her wisdom and attitude on life, and Dorcas, for her ability to poke subtle fun at herself.  Characters I found a bit annoying: self-righteous Thomas Brown, and childish Twister.  Now I am floundering around the amazon videos, trying to find something just as good.  No luck, so far.",1461715200,,868,4.726666666666667

The acting is superb, and includes many fine actors we have seen in other series: Brendan Coyle (Downton Abbey), Julia Sawalla (Absolutely Fabulous), Ruby Bentall (Poldark), Dawn French (The Vicar of Dibley) among many other fine actors.  You will laugh, cry, and root for each character as the seasons unfold.  I find I watch this series (all four) at least twice a year, especially when I'm in the mood to get lost in the lives of fictional characters from a different time period.  I get caught up in each story, and I find there is a nice balance between the sentimental and the dramatic.  I was sad to see the series end.",1459209600,,807,4.615384615384615

One thing that still sticks out to me, is that these people sound like they are talking babytalk. !!! Is it the dialect???? idk. Very lightweight, somewhat banal, and sweet.

4095138,4,B00395ATT0,This series of episodes depicting small town and hamlet living in the UK presents community issues and personality traits that are enduring in our civilization. The suggested solutions and workings-out are often simplistic and therefore widely applicable to the human condition.

The theme music puts my dogs in such a peaceful happy place in their dog beds beside me. I get to visit the Lark Rise and Candleford characters as old friends by the 3rd season with their wholesome, picturesque lifestyles.  Too bad Brendan Coyle left for Downton Abby but we LOVE that series too. I just wish Lark Rise season 4 was also available on Prime ticket or download.

While there is plenty of conflict and resolution set in a 'series' of stories, there is a gentleness, a welcome relief from the trend toward appealing to the lowest common denominator. It appears as though each actor is immersed in their character. When I see the actors in other roles I have a tough time believing it is the same person, they so portray their ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" characters that well. I am disappointed it ended. They are such marvelous actors they deserve to go on to other things.

May suggestions is to watch 3-4 episodes and make up your own mind.",1424476800,,655,4.5508474576271185

Lark Rise to Candleford is a nice departure from many British series depicting the English upper classes. This series also depicts the local gentry but focuses on the growth of a small town inhabited by a unique collection of middle class residents and a poor farming community with very interesting characters. You come to like all the characters because they are regular people with flaws and admirable qualities. You witness the tensions between the small hamlet, Lark Rise and the growing town, Candleford. The story is told by the young woman, Laura Timmons who leaves home to start her work at the Candleford post office. She is a writer and keen observer of her home and all the people in her life.

Life in two small towns featuring both the have's and the have nots (this takes place in England) before cars and just about time they were building railroads. The leading character, Dorcas is the town postmistress, beloved by all, she is a fount of wisdom.  It's lovely being able to watch shows without fear that the characters are suddenly going to start having sex on the kitchen table and nobody displays any violence at all besides a harsh word or two. Every type of personality and character is portrayed and we even have ""Mr. Bates"" from Downton Abbey playing a substantial role as a hardworking craftsman with a large family in the town of Lark Rise - he is called Robert Timmins in this story, fair-minded and even-handed but a touch bit over-proud.  Sort of like Bates with shoddier clothes.

4095239,4,B00395ATT0,"A generally delightful little series on the ups and downs of two closely related late 19th century English villages.  The plots, usually revolving around the loves and tribulations of various couples young and old, can get a little ""soap opera-esque"" at times, but usually keep your attention.  The acting is very good, even if the depiction of 18th century life is a little polly-annish.",1419292800,,388,5.046875

4095266,2,B00395ATT0,"It started out OK, but the story lines are getting a bit tired and silly.  I'm not really a fan of trying to apply modern day dilemmas to a period drama.  It seems to create a story full of contradictory behaviors that make no sense.  Also, it quite obviously mocks the belief in God and morality.  Not reflective of the time period at all.  It's ok to have on in the background but doesn't hold my attention and sometimes annoys me.",1418428800,,433,4.296296296296297

4095351,5,B00395ATT0,"Heartwarming, down to earth, if a bit romantic about the poverty-stricken Lark Rise community.  Wonderfully well casted, complex characters.  The coming-of-age story of Laura as she tells it in later life is both beautiful and insightful, never pollyanna-ish, and the sometimes wise, sometimes foolish interventions of her mentor, Dorcas, in the affairs of people she cares about, are great lessons in the art of living lovingly -- not to mention a source of her self discovery.  Twister, Thomas and Margaret, and especially Minnie make me laugh out loudl Queenie is a delight, as is Alf Arless.  At first I feared Brendan Coyle was locked into his ""Bates"" taciturnity mode, so I loved to see his softer, 'reaching out to his family and neighbors side'. Thanks for giving me so much delightful entertainment, perfect to relax to before trying for sleep!  I don't understand why it hasn't gotten more play on PBS.  I choose it anyday over ""The Paradise.""",1415750400,,953,5.0

I don't always rate the different shows I watch because so many others do - but I have to say this is one of the most loveable series I have ever watched.  Every person is so wonderful and after watching for a while you just seem to become one of them in a way.  It's actually hard to state how I would say to someone to watch this wonderful series other than just start doing it - in the first season you will get acquainted to the characters and they may seem a little - well unorthodox  - after you get the feel of them you will love them so much - I appreciate that those who did this series set it in a situation of working each person so well - it's not always when one sees a series when each person's intricate personality is brought out so well - and that a person actually watching the series is actually almost feeling like one is also involved and part of the whole towns and people.

4095393,3,B00395ATT0,"I really enjoyed the first two seasons of LRTC, but the enthusiasm and interest started to wear off by Season 3.  I should probably clarify that I binged watched this series, which I would not recommend.  There were consistency issues in the storyline, as others have mentioned, between Seasons 2 and 3.  It is a hollywood version of the early 1800's.  (The folks from LR always ready with a song and spontaneous dance.)  If you want historical accuracy, you will never go wrong with Dickens.  This series will scratch the itch if you are looking for a mindless, and sometimes amusing, period drama.  For true gems, Cranford and Parade's End are both well written, have tremendous actors and are beautifully filmed.  It's funny because Julia Sawalha was in both LRTC and Cranford, yet in LRTC, she seemed to be more of a caricature than an actual character.",1414368000,,857,4.782312925170068

Similar to ""Upstairs Downstairs"" and ""Downton Abbey"".  The actors are top notch.  Almost like a trip back in time in many ways.  My Wife and I have really enjoyed the entire 4 seasons.

Great for 14 and up viewers, some violence and suggestive language.",1410998400,,389,4.647058823529412

4095500,3,B00395ATT0,"It  seems as if they have lost the thread of things.  Characters are becoming  not more complex,  but  just weird.  Some of the episodes are just plain disturbing,  with ghosts and whispers and druid worship etc.  And they are turning Thomas into a weird rigid silly man because of his belief in God....People just up and leave the towns without ever another mention.  Easy way to fire an actor but leaves us all wondering what happened to them.  Even the story lines don't often make sense anymore. Nope,  something happened with this series and it isn't good.",1410393600,,561,4.680412371134021

4095521,5,B00395ATT0,"We accidently happened upon this series on Amazon.  We started watching and can't stop.  Four seasons of this captivating series are available free with your Amazon Prime subscription.  This is the story of very simple life, and the comparison between the tenant farmer community of Lark Rise, and the ""Metropolitan"" life in the small town of Candleford.  The story starts with a dispute over mail delivery.  The mail carrier has refused to deliver the mail to Lark Rise, because it is outside the 8 mile limit.  The distance is measured and found to be less than 8 miles, but not before Queenie, a resident of Lark Rise misses the funeral of a relative, because she did not receive a letter.  It doesn't take long to become familiar with, and attached to, the residents of both communities. We have found the stories to be just as addictive as Downton Abbey, and wonder why PBS has not opted to run it as well. We have watched the first two seasons, and have started the third and looking forward to season four.",1409616000,,1013,4.625698324022347

4095524,5,B00395ATT0,"The best show the BBC ever produced!
1. It deals with the class systems in England at the turn of the last century.
2. It provides accurate answer to the question of women's rights in England at that time.
3. It aptly deals with the issue of spirituality, religion, and human conditions.
4. Historically accurate.
5. Based on true story.
6. The writing, acting, and costume designing are superb.

4095537,2,B00395ATT0,"Unfortunately, the writer's antipathy toward Christianity comes to the forefront in Season 3. Paganism is portrayed as getting back to nature, and the belief that Christ is the only way to eternal life is portrayed as narrow-minded and bigoted. In addition, any literal belief in the Bible's account of creation is portrayed as ignorance and contrasted with the genius of Charles Darwin. Furthermore, the only supernatural activities are brought about by witchcraft. None are shown resulting from the prayers of Christians. If you can overlook the writer's bias against Christianity, the rest of the story is well told and entertaining.",1409011200,3,636,5.37

4095557,5,B00395ATT0,"A mellow ~ tranquil period show, set in the slowed-down life of the late 1800's.
I find myself drawn in, and fascinated with different phrases of that period.
And the simplicity depicted, calmer speaking, and kindness, thoughtfulness.

The setting is of two small communities, one wealthier, and self appointed more refined,
verse the working class, with less means, but strong camaraderie, social comradeship.

A show that requires one to slow down, and rewards by leaving you calmer then you where.
The fabric of the script? Honestly - morality - kindness - romance,
and the best humans can be in hard times.

Every show has it's downs, and it has its fair share I guess, but all I know is I was watching this on my Amazon Prime TV and thoroughly enjoyed being able to watch episode after episode. I would do needed house chores and then ""treat"" myself to another episode, thoroughly looking forward to them. This is as much a review of Amazon Prime TV as I am so tickled pink with it. I would stop at a point and have to go do things, and there it is waiting for me when I get back--just like with a dvd.

4095614,5,B00395ATT0,"With all the series out there about murder, crime, terrorism, etc. this show is good medicine for the soul. Set just at the beginning of the industrial revolution in rural England, the plots play the village hamlet of Lark Rise against the growing town of Candleford, highlighting old ways vs news ways -- wisdom vs sophistication -- and brings it all home to the basic struggle for members of both communities to care for one another, resolve difficulties, reach understanding. Lark Rise girl Laura goes to work in Candleford for her aunt Dorcas, who is a lady of her own means, a business woman. This initiates the comparison of lifestyles and values. It is a brilliant study of human nature, and so compassionate. Not that it's soppy -- humor, drama, and charm abound. My favorite characters are the Lark Rise wise woman Queenie with her eccentric husband Twister, and pompous post man Thomas with his shy pastor's daughter wife Margaret. Then there are the spinster sisters who run the dress shop ... Emma and Robert Timmons, the village couple. Millie the naive, blundering and endearing maid. What am I talking about? They're all my favorites. This show has warmed me and helped me through some tough times. BBC cannot be beat!",1406764800,,1233,4.848341232227488

(She played Kitty.). I loved the serene Linda Bassett who played Queenie, my favorite character hands down.  Get all 4 seasons.  This entire story has romance, intrigue, laughs, and some social commentary.  Oh, it also has the dreamy and gorgeous Ben Aldridge as Daniel Parrish.

The acting is superb and each character develops in a way that creates actuality rather than illusion. The costumes, historic research and writing combine along with the way the series is filmed and directed to bring viewers to believe they too inhabit this small village and town. The whole series is delightful,  and yet it contains moments that are filled with the complexities of the human condition. Art as well as entertainment. Love it.",1403740800,,526,4.910112359550562

How did industrialization effect normal folks?  There's a blueprint there for us now, as we enter the age of cleaning up Industrialization's environmental effects.

My favorite characters are Emma, Robert (Laura's parents), Queenie, and Ms. Lane but each character has a role to fill and is equally fun to watch when you aren't wanting to kick them in the seat of their pants.  The Pratt sisters are also fun to watch with their nosy and high and mighty, contradicting personalities.  This series is an easy marathon watch. :)",1401580800,,582,4.640776699029126

They do it with a deft hand not drawing conclusion for the viewer but raising issues for the viewer to think about.

4095853,5,B00395ATT0,"Larkrise to Candleford, in my humble opinion, is perhaps the finest period drama ever produced. The acting is splendid, the sets spectacular, and the story lines manage to appeal to every human emotion! A few of the characters will no doubt endear themselves to most viewers; Minnie, Twister, and Quennie to name a few. LTC is worth watching again, and again! Which I've done! If you enjoy vulgarity, violence, nudity, car chases, and titillating story lines, this show is not for you! Thank you BBC for excellence in broadcasting

4095938,5,B00395ATT0,"Another British series filled with in depth character development.  The townspeople of Candleford live far different lives than the peasant families in the village of Lark Rise yet their lives are interwoven and they are dependent on each other.  Dorcas Lane, the postmistress is the quintessential nosy do gooder with so many fingers in so many pies.  Outstanding supporting cast; each one's perspective unfolds as this English Rose of a series blooms.  Too bad Dawn French (""The Vicar of Dibley"") left early on followed by the future Mr. Bates of ""Downton Abbey"" after the third season.

4095949,4,B00395ATT0,Interesting time period.ore realistic view of village life. Thoughtful dialogue. Only I minus is patronizing view of Christians at time & no recognition of importance religion played at that period.,1394582400,,198,5.633333333333334
4095950,5,B00395ATT0,"I loved all of the episodes of this series!  I only wish that the story had been continued longer than four seasons..  All of the characters in the story are interesting and the story is authentic, written by a person who lived it.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the very human responses to life's various challenges, especially the human relationships.  There was much attention to the varieties of the  characters' values.  I found the character of Caroline Arliss especially fascinating, and wanted to know more of her earlier life.  She so enjoyed life, but lived with little restraint on her behavior.  Her love for her children was unrestrained, but also reckless.  Her irresponsibility about debt and drinking cause much distress, and eventually caught up to her in such a painful way.  How many people in our own lives can we compare to this special human problem?

I also enjoyed the character of Dorcas Lane. Her steadfast and dutiful role as the village postmistress, in a time when few women held that position in their community, is lovely.  It was rewarding to see her overcome her own self-imposed limits at the end, and to accept the idea of sharing her life with a loved, and lovely man.  Her character is one that is rare in these modern times, with devotion to tradition, duty and community standing.  Even when her inclination to offer helpful advice to others became more a case of meddling than beneficial help, she remained pleasant, and open to learning a different way.

The actors in this series did a good job.  After enjoying many BBC productions, it is my opinion that the British actors, writers, producers and directors view their careers more as a profession and less  as pure celebrity than  their American counterparts. Most of British actors seem to  have long, productive careers, all the while improving their craft, and enjoying many varieties of roles.  The script writing is excellent.  In all, those who produce the BBC television series do an excellent job.

I feel sure that all of those good people who contribute so much to our enjoyment in the British TV productions must eventually tire of the doing the same story over many years.  However, I do wish this series had continued its story past the point in history where it ended after completion of their fourth season.  I seem not to be alone in this desire, as evidenced by responses in comments offered online.  I am grateful for all the pleasant hours this program has afforded to me.

I love the atmosphere of that community.  It was indeed a treat to see people portrayed in life situations without violence or senseless crime and bloodshed.  What a shame it happens only in fictional offerings.  It was also lovely to see a community portrayed with few creature comforts that enjoyed life for its basic pleasures and blessings.

I will certainly watch the four seasons of Lark Rise To Candleford again, whenever my spirits need lifting. I recommend this series to anyone who seeks pleasant edifying entertainment that will leave them feeling joyful.",1394582400,,3053,4.871844660194175

4095953,5,B00395ATT0,"Much more compelling than Downton Abbey, this sweet series takes place in England at the end of the nineteenth century. There is a contrast between the poor people in the hamlet of Lark Rise and the middle class people in the village of Candleford.

All characters have flaws, but there are few real villains. Many characters are heroic, but still human with frailties and blind spots. Mistakes are made, Chaste love is presented as a worthy ideal.  How unusual!

The one complaint I have is how Thomas Brown is depicted as an overbearing (and idiotic) Christian. Christians seem to be always portrayed this way.

I appreciate having available films and series in which there is a strong story line without any violence, bad language, or gratuitous sexually explicit scenes.

Downton Abbey.  The wonderful advantage to Larkrise is that it takes place in the
1800s  the characters are all so colorful,  each has very different qualities and it
lasts for 4 glorious seasons -  12 episodes per season.  The scenery is lovely,  the
acting excellent with well written stories in each episode.  I recommend it for
viewers who enjoy non-violent, humorous yet serious story lines and who like a trip to
the past with very colorufl characters and very sweet yet touching plots.",1390867200,,577,4.767676767676767

Great actresses/actors and plots, based on the writings of a bona fide author. The English country ""folk"" were captured very well at a time when so many changes, worldwide, were in the works.

4096190,4,B00395ATT0,"As usual, this is another great season for Larkrise to Candleford.  The character development and stories are entertaining.  The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is that the writing seems to jump around sometimes and characters leave without much explanation as to why.  I noticed this mostly in Season 2, but also a little in Season 3.  I'm not done with season 3, but I'm thoroughly enjoying it and have highly recommended this series to everyone I know!",1389225600,,465,4.634146341463414

Every once in a while, I just need a break from  movies and tv that have horrible scripts, but have loads of fiery explosions and gratuitous naked/adult scenes.

This is a slice of life not well known across the Atlantic and, because my ancestors came from GB, I love to learn about the earlier centuries there.

4096393,4,B00395ATT0,"Finished season three. It is good but I liked seasons one and two better. Season 3 seems to have more serious subject matters than the prior episodes. The new character, Minnie, is more annoying than funny. Still, the show has a very calming affect and you enjoy watching the lives of the characters unfold before you. In the last few episodes of Season Three some of the primary characters from earlier seasons are mentioned but are not seen. I would bet that is because Brendon Coyle (Mr. Timmins) is off filming Downton Abbey and the lady who plays Mrs. Arliss (can't think of her name) is off filming a Harry Potter movie.

4096398,5,B00395ATT0,"I have been totally hooked on Lark Rise to Candleford. Everything about it (Actors, costuming, set design, story lines, etc.) was perfection. It made me glad I had an Amazon Prime membership and sent me searching for something comparable. As far as Lark Rise goes, I hope everyone hangs in for 2 or 3 episodes and they, too, will be hooked.

There were a few instances when interest perked up -- like the episode about bringing in the harvest. That showed some of the actual life of the hamlet inhabitants instead of plots that could have been played out in any era. Characters that were annoying to begin with continue as such.

4096472,5,B00395ATT0,"Wish more people knew about this series. I love all the characters, and not just the main ones. It tells the story of a girl, Laura Timmons, who moves from a small hamlet to the nearby city, hence Larkrise to Candleford, where she works in the post office which is owned by her relative, Dorcas Lane. As the series progresses, she gets a promotion, falls in love, learns many life lessons and grows into a young woman. Other characters progress along the way as well, getting married, having children (or not, as the case may be), moving away, or going to prison. In the background, but clearly having its effect on the inhabitants, is the industrial revolution, the coming of trains to the nearby villages, and the beginnings of the first motorized vehicles. This wonderful story shows how all of these changes affected the rural communities of Larkrise and Candleford. You will not be disappointed! Very well done, with costumes and sets portraying the countryside of late nineteenth century England.",1377561600,,1002,4.9

I've seen all the seasons 3 times and will start my 4th time around next week. Some of the most well developed characters I've ever seen and the story lines are interesting. Again I ask...WHAT idiot decided to cancel this show in the middle of season 4? Hope they got fired whoever they are. Truly stupid decision.,1375574400,,489,4.104166666666667

It is an amazingly beautiful depiction of a perhaps stylized world, one that is far removed from the rudeness and bustle of our world, yet filled with nuance and drama.  The acting is superb, though that is to be expected from the BBC - they know how to put together a great show.  The stories are each complete in and of themselves, with the collective whole even more delicious.  I want to work for Miss Lane!",1375574400,2,555,4.349514563106796

4096519,5,B00395ATT0,"This is an example and testimony to the victory and reward  of kindness.  Kindness is not the usual unidirectional-from the upper class of aristocracy to the commoners. It also shows kindness from the lower class towards the upper.  When all said and done, humanity has the last laugh.  Very touching and unpretentious.",1375315200,,319,5.076923076923077

4096535,5,B00395ATT0,This is one of those kinds of shows that I just love to watch set in the older times. Has a great plot to it ... only wish it had kept going they did however finish the ending the way it should have been.  Its streaming video if you join Prime.,1374624000,,244,3.784313725490196

4096540,5,B00395ATT0,"This is a lovely period drama/comedy set in England in the time of 1899.  Two towns are within seven miles of each other and share their life experiences.  The prime difference is Class where Candleford is Upper Middle and Lark Spur Agricultural Middle.  The episodes always are shared situations that carry a common  morale by the time the story is completed.  Narrated by a resident of Larkspur, the audience is mutually aware of the plot as it is related to the family of Brenden Coyle's character for Larkspur and the Post mistress for Candleford.  The best way to enjoy Season 3 is to have viewed the two previous seasons, just
as is the recommended course for viewers of Downton Abbey but this is not an absolute necessity because each episode is stand alone.  Since excellent English actors fill the ensemble cast, PBS has sent another memorable and fine story across the Pond.",1374364800,,884,4.776315789473684
4096541,5,B00395ATT0,After watching Downton Abbey I thought this show might be interesting. I love it and dread that I am nearly at the very end of season 4.

I could get a feel for this by reading books, which I have done, but when the story is told with people and visual help it is easier to understand class, social issues of the day, and how truly large and overpowering was the difference between poor and rich.  Watch this series it is well done.",1374364800,,461,4.337209302325581

4096547,5,B00395ATT0,"This is the G rated version of Downton Abbey. Very fun, very light and totally enjoyable. This would be appropriate for 8 year olds and older.  I do not watch movies a second time, but I may make an exception to these. I wish there were more clean shows like this available. I love historical fiction, and this satisfies that, as well.",1373846400,,335,4.403225806451613

4096555,5,B00395ATT0,"Lark Rise just gets better and better.  The show is improved by the addition of Daniel, which leads to conflict at the end of the season--the last two episodes are a must-see for fans. My favorite episodes feature Enid Fairley and Mr. Reppington--listening to Minnie mangling his name makes it worth watching on that alone! If you want family entertainment, no cursing, no skin, this is the show to watch.",1373328000,,405,4.785714285714286

4096561,5,B00395ATT0,"I can't understand why this series was cancelled.  It's far better than most American television.  The characters were very engaging.  Their individual stories made it difficult to choose a favorite, so I didn't.  The actors were all just fantastic.",1372723200,,249,5.3076923076923075
4096562,5,B00395ATT0,"I enjoyed watching it because it was charming.  I enjoyed the way each character showed a human strength and weakness.

4096567,4,B00395ATT0,"The characters in this series are enjoyable and the episodes are entertaining. We felt like it was something the whole family could enjoy together. However, we did not care for the fact that some of the episodes were about ghosts or how they portray the Christian man to be an idiot. As with most series, we found them to be most enjoyable in the beginning and as the seasons progressed, the storyline became more diluted and the characters became weaker. Overall, we enjoyed it and looked forward to watching it.",1372291200,,513,4.711111111111111

4096595,5,B00395ATT0,"This season and, in fact, the series, depicts the moral dilemmas and relationship challenges solved by the delightful characters that live together in Lark Rise, Candleford and the surrounding area.  And the producer has done this without gratuitous sex, drugs and violence.  An excellent ""coming of age"" program showing ""rights of passage"" for young people not common in current entertainment.  The adult characters exhibit compassion towards themselves and their neighbors as well as adapting to the changes in the wider world encroaching on their community.  The stories are not juvenile but retain the simplicity of people learning to live and love their lives.  ""I love it!"" is our honest opinion of ""Lark Rise to Candleford.""

Rich characters,  luscious story plots,  you cannot help complete immersion.  There was an audible groan across the world when they ended this treasure with a short 4th season.

I have the first two seasons and this third season continues the wonderful saga of folks in the village of Lark Rise and those upper class folks in the township of Candleford. I loved how each episode has its own central theme and sends a specific message about life issues.

4096626,5,B00395ATT0,The costuming is fabulous!!  Worth watching just to see the clothes of that time period.  The main characters are well developed.,1369785600,,129,5.095238095238095
4096627,5,B00395ATT0,"I am a huge fan of period drama and so I am always searching for a new series to watch.  I stumbled upon the Lark Rise to Candleford series and began watching Season 3.  I quickly fell in love with the characters, recognizing a few of the actors from other dramas.  What I love about BBC is that they are superior at developing interesting characters that you quickly come to love.  It draws you in so that you are compelled to keep watching.  Far superior than American television programming which has become vulgar and predictable.  There is very little originality and the content is so trashy that I just cannot stomach it anymore.",1369785600,,636,4.584070796460177
4096628,5,B00395ATT0,"I love this series and I wish there more seasons rather than just 4.  All of the characters are simple and dealing with the complexities of their lives in the late 1800's.  It is nice to see the parallels between their time and today.  The same things are of concern, the changes that modernization bring, people and relationships, tactfulness and ethical behavior as well as an appreciation and joyfulness for the simple things that life has to offer.  They, in their time, emphasized this much more than we do today.  Maybe that is the charm of this series.  Helping us to understand our own world a little better.  Stepping back and smelling the roses, so to speak.  I love Queenie, Emma, Dorcas, Laura, so many wonderful views of feminine nature as well as everything from manly men to young men who raise their younger siblings thru hard work in the fields. This series to me is more truthful than Downton Abbey in such a sweet, charming way.  Great!",1369785600,,955,4.636904761904762
4096629,5,B00395ATT0,This was a very good show! Each episode is full of lessons and moral values. I wish there are more shows like this on American television. Our children can learn a lot from this!,1369785600,,178,4.264705882352941

Above all, at the end of each episode,my husband &I are uplifted and encouraged ....So thoroughly entertained and satisfied with the use of our time. This is entertainment at it's best from the BBC. America would do well in following this glowing example in prime time ""family viewing"", offering it's public, entertainment  that the entire family, from the elderly to the youth could all enjoy!
Each character, from the wise, gracious postmistress(Dorcus) of CANDLEFORD to the cantankerous,Twister of LARK RISE, lend their unque personalities to provide outstanding entertainment----Such a shame, this series lasted only six seasons!  BRING IT BACK, PLEASE,",1368835200,,805,5.536585365853658

Loved it, and then, all story lines were left hanging.  Laura wasn't even featured in the last episode.  Why didn't they follow through with at least one more episode, to tie up loose ends, give us some happily ever afters, instead of the frustration we're left with?",1368748800,,392,4.492957746478873

4096660,5,B00395ATT0,"The small town of Candleford and the neighboring village of Lark Rise are filled with wonderful characters whose lives are filled with love, laughter, romance, jealousy, and loss of loved ones. Laura, the main character, leaves her small, quaint village to live with a middle-aged relative who runs the post office of Candleford Town. The series are filled with wonderful subplots and characters from both the village and the town. The costumes, speech, and the households are so well done that it is easy to see why the series won many awards. The characters get into conflicts, but manage to work through their struggles with the aide from their neighbors. You can see the coming of the ""modern ages"" inventions such as the wheat planter, the new train with its rails laid across the once peaceful pastures, and the usage of electricity will forever change the lives of all of the area's people.

Although I may not agree with some of the underlying messages about religion mixed with superstitions/traditions, it is no mystery how the real world works anyway -- religion mixed with traditions.

4096708,5,B00395ATT0,"This was one of the most engaging series I have followed in a long time involving day-to-day experiences. Set in 1895 rural England, the cast of characters is great and can actually act and emote, contrary to most American actors. I am so disappointed it only had 4 seasons.",1366588800,,274,4.612244897959184

4096713,4,B00395ATT0,I was very sad when I was caught up on Downton Abbey and looked to fill the void with Lark Rise. I really enjoyed Lark Rise and it was very much something I like. It was really more frustrating to watch that Downton Abbey because everytime they bring in a character and you really like them and their interaction with the main cast they take them away. I still haven't gotten over the what would it have been like if they had stayed...,1366156800,,435,4.253012048192771

4096716,5,B00395ATT0,"I do not understand why BBC cancelled this wonderful piece of early small rural English countryside charm. The characters are all masterfully portrayed, the scenery is magnificent and it is alive with quirky characters who tend to warm your heart. Common people who have very little and getting by. My wife and I enjoyed it tremendously. We felt that the cast were some of England's most wonderful character actors.

4096729,5,B00395ATT0,"A Victorian period piece that does a great job of developing the characters in a socially stratified society that was starting to crumble due to the broadening Industrial Revolution in England.  This is family viewing without the language, violence and sexuality to which we are usually treated.  Brilliant!

Only small minus is that subtitles, which are available on DVD versions, are not provided.",1365552000,,399,5.301587301587301
4096730,5,B00395ATT0,This show is fabulous. The characters are very sweet and you grow to love them. Dorcus Lane has the best advice in every sticky situation.

4096731,5,B00395ATT0,"I was sorry to see that this series was cancelled after four and a half seasons.  As far as I'm concerned, it could have gone on for at least another four and a half.  The topics of the individual shows were engaging.  The actors performed their roles with enthusiasm and warmth.  Each episode was well written with its own theme but linked to the series story line.  It was fun to discover more about each character with every episode.  Farewell Miss Lane, little Sydney, Laura, Emma, etc.!!!",1365552000,,493,4.609195402298851
4096732,5,B00395ATT0,"heart-rending episodes of triumphs and tragedies in this season....although it was hard to watch he death of alf's younger brother, it was touching to see the candleford and larkrise folk working together to nurse the children. Emma showed her strength and imagination teaching the children, when the previous teacher left the post unfilled. One could feel the longing and frustrated desire that emma was feeling to use her gifts in teaching, knowing that she would be unable to continue to teach indefinitely, as there would be a new teacher with ""proper credentials"" coming to fill the position. Thomas was in a great upset after visiting the London post office and realizing that the postal workers did not have to work as many hours as he did, creating a stir that eventually, with the aid of Robert Timmins, brought about a desirable solution to his complaint. we see a breaking in the pearl's facade, thru the letting down of her emotional barriers with the friendship of a fellow liberal seamstress who turned pearl's world upside down and back up again bringing pearl a liberating freedom never before experienced.  Larkrise to Candleford is one of my very favorite movies. It is a great classic that will last thru generations. This ranks with Jane Austen's pride and predudice and  Emma. I have enjoyed it even greater the second time around. The acting is superb, and the content so enjoyable for the whole family......there were two  episodes in the two previous seasons  that i didn't bother rewatching---the christmas extra story with the ghostly maiden coming and going, slipping in and out of a murky pond.  It was too much unearthliness and not the good content of most of the series. the same was true of the episode with the blood running down a tree. It was not my ""cup of tea"" so i did not bother watching again.",1365465600,,1833,4.82484076433121
4096733,5,B00395ATT0,I Love Larkrise!  Its slow pace and family based stories are just the right juxtaposition for all the violence and inappropriate garbage on TV today.,1365465600,,149,4.96

4096737,3,B00395ATT0,"I didn't think season 3 was as good as season 1 and 2.  I feel this season was rushed and left us hanging with some of the key characters.  Perhaps my expectations were high since the first 2 seasons were much, much better. Its too bad that the series ended.",1365465600,,258,4.14
4096738,5,B00395ATT0,"If you've already watched the first two seasons, keep watching! The good stuff remains, and new developments keep life interesting in Lark Rise and Candleford.

4096748,5,B00395ATT0,"This is a really fun period drama about the interaction between characters living in a tiny hamlet called Lark Rise and those living in a town called Candleford.  Characters are fully developed and the stories are fun and interesting.  This is pure drama and has little or no action, so it will be interesting to you if you like period drama and stories about people, the choices they make, and how everyone is affected by these behaviors and decisions.  It provides interesting insight into the period in England leading up to the industrial revolution.",1364774400,,554,4.872340425531915

I'd definitely recommend this to anyone that likes this period. I only wish I could get these to play on my laptop so that I could watch with my mother. It's not as fun watching these alone, since I watch them on my mini tablet. Over all thumbs up! Happy watching to whoever reads this!",1364774400,,415,4.265822784810126

4096752,5,B00395ATT0,"I have watched the entire series and have also read the book. While there are some differences, the series stays true to the book and the acting is superb on all levels. This series is based on interpersonal relationships and small town and village life, so those of you who are more interested in action, will not like this series. Themes of personal growth, family relations, financial hardship and even women's lib are examnied and they are done so very well. You will see many familiar faces here from other BBC programs such as ""Cranford"", ""French and Saunders"" and even the renowned ""Downton Abbey"". No wonder the BBC uses the same actors for so many venues when they turn in performances this good!

P.S. I DO have a crush on Julia Sawalha!",1364601600,,747,4.659090909090909

4096764,1,B00395ATT0,"The writers seem to have lost inspiration as well - several of the episodes were simply ridiculous.

Agnosticism reigns supreme while local nature worshipers are extolled and praised for their superstitious beliefs.  Meanwhile, Christians are painted as tyrannical (the rector), or outright crazy (Thomas the Postman).  Not a good presentation or representation of prewar (WW I) back-country England.

Disappointing.",1364515200,3,416,6.0
4096765,5,B00395ATT0,"I have enjoyed the entire series, and was sad when season 4 ended the program with only half the usual number of episodes. The simpler, less complicated times, and the main characters are what keep me watching this series over and over. Though some of the characters seem to be predictable in their prejudices or just plain stupidity, that's humanity, but you have to watch & wait for what might change what you expect of them. A great look at Victorian England and the gaps in the levels of society. I love Julia Sawalha as Dorcas Lane and Olivia Hallinan as Laura. With Brendan Coyle, as Robert Timmons, leaving before the final episode in this series, we know where he really went, ... to ""DOWNTON ABBEY"", another favorite.",1364169600,,726,4.6796875

4096787,5,B00395ATT0,"I loved the characters, the realistic sets-complete with teapot cozy.  I just enjoyed the interactions of life between the residents of Lark Rise and Candleford.  It was a great series, but I was wondering if there is, or will be a season 5.",1363219200,,241,4.5813953488372094
4096788,5,B00395ATT0,"After the first few episodes of Lark Rise to Candleford, I was hooked.  The acting is superb and the characters unforgettable. The setting is the English countryside in the late 1800's and it's obvious that efforts have been made to authenticate it through costume and set.  I feel like the characters are my best friends and that I could very easily move into the small hamlet of Lark Rise or the ""town"" of Candleford and fit right in! There's serious drama, humor, joy, and sorrow and it's so well done that you feel you are actually a participant. It's a show for the whole family to sit and watch together.",1363219200,,610,4.536363636363636

4096791,5,B00395ATT0,We loved sitting down and watching Lark Rise to Candleford.  Some evenings we may only watch one episode and others we would watch three.,1363219200,,137,4.708333333333333

4096800,5,B00395ATT0,"I was missing this show the minute I finished the last episode.  The  acting was superb, the characters were terribly likable and the story line very interesting and educational.  I loved the interaction between the two groups, the Lark Risers and the Candlefordians, and the basic and heartfelt respect for each other at the core. The filming was beautiful, creating  a truly believable time.  The costumes were gorgeous.  My favorite aspect of the show were the characters, whether sharing what little they had or Dorcas Lane' s compassion and  concern for her neighbors. My favorites were the Lark Risers and their ability to deal with adversity and do it with grace.  As I said, I wish this series could go on and on and on.",1362873600,,728,4.768
4096801,5,B00395ATT0,A beautiful story.  Was never able to watch it on TV so I enjoyed being able to catch every episode.,1362787200,,100,4.0
4096802,5,B00395ATT0,Great series.  Great recording. Fast service.  The British know how to make movies and bring in British humor.  Really entertaining.,1362700800,,132,5.5
4096803,5,B00395ATT0,Loved it! Sad that it was only 4 seasons. You fall in love with characters right away and by the fourth season you are so invested and then it suddenly wraps up in 1 episode and is done.,1362614400,,186,3.9210526315789473
4096804,5,B00395ATT0,"Great show ! Loved to watch this show to find out what Dorcas was up to next, and Laura what a cute actress . If you like Ann of Green Gables you,ll really like this one too!",1362441600,,174,3.72972972972973

4096806,5,B00395ATT0,"I just celebrated my 20+ wedding anniversary. Watching these episodes and re-reading my journals gave me an opportunity to remember - with laughter some of
my traumatic martial first, such as when Emma pointed out Robert had stinky feet and the camera fell on his feet showing the holes in his each sock with the toe exposed.  I laughted with Emma and Robt but as a new wife I did not find it amusing to have a husband in that situation. My Dad never wore socks with holes in them. He soaked his feet each night before he took a bath.  After all, suppose my husband had been involved in an accident and had to be taken to a hospital!  What would people think of me for not removing those socks from his drawer?  I am ashamed of the importance I gave the situation in real life (I later accepted, my husband enjoys wearing holes in his socks.  He says it allows his feet to have air.)Reflecting, I see others have experienced the same situation or at least the writers of this episode, and I am delighted with the common sense approach the on screen characters used to diffuse anger.  The show is not only entertaining but is thought provoking. Also, who is to say in hamlets and villages at the time depicted in this piece, women and men did not entertain 20th century procedures in the business world (arbitrators for labor/Management)or adoptions by a single woman did not occur probably under another name. I love this series, the actors, writers, the costumers and the video editors. Thank you.",1362441600,,1498,4.550185873605948
4096807,5,B00395ATT0,"I rated this show high because the viewer is so drawn into the plots and the characters. Each episode is another clean, decent, fun, and often funny 1 hour drama that our family and friends much enjoy. Being a retired US Postmaster I find that the the Royal Mail and Candleford Post Office of the late 1800s is interesting and quite intriguing. As the center of the storyline it and Postmaster Dorcas Lane add a common thread to the folk of Lark Rise and Candleford. Excellent show that I wish had run longer..",1362441600,,510,4.494623655913978
4096808,5,B00395ATT0,"I started watching this and in a week was done with the entire series.  It was beautiful!  It was clean, the characters were likeable and good, and I was happy after watching each episode.  I loved the costuming choices and settings, and the writing was very clever.  I will watch it again.",1362441600,,290,4.519230769230769

4096812,5,B00395ATT0,"I loved this series. Less dramatic and serious than Downton Abby, but just as addicting. More humor and fun but serious situations too. I loved the main characters like Dorcus, Thomas and Emma and main character Laura. I wish that it would have had a few more episodes to satisfy my need to see Laura and Dorcas fulfill their love life instead of ending so soon. I loved it and could not wait to watch each episode.",1362355200,,415,4.402597402597403
4096813,5,B00395ATT0,The stories of the lives of the people of Lark Rise and Candleford is so interesting.  How the post office was the center of what went on in Candleford.,1362355200,,152,4.241379310344827

4096819,4,B00395ATT0,"My husband and I watched all episodes over a 10 day period.  We both thoroughly enjoyed it.  The only issue we had with it was that the last few episodes did not include one or two of the major characters.  They were major characters in the story but were left hanging, while the rest of the characters had a resolution to their roles.  Highly recommend to individuals who enjoy period pieces and the English countryside.",1361923200,,421,4.573333333333333
4096820,5,B00395ATT0,"Great show. Wholesome goodness and something the entire family can enjoy. All episodes have an ending, not drawn on like one long day.",1361836800,,134,4.869565217391305

BRITISH SERIES THAT PBS OFFERS.

4096827,5,B00395ATT0,This series has the best character development of any show I've ever watched. Wholesome and believable story lines with excellent acting. The accents are hard to follow until your ear gets tuned to them. Historical accuracy of customs and terminology makes you feel as if you are living the episodes instead of merely observing. I only wish that Flora Thompson had written more because I will hate to see this series end.,1361836800,,421,4.861111111111111

4096834,4,B00395ATT0,We are hooked.  It's become a common date to watch together.  It is contrived but in a nice way and lots of great scenery and clothing.,1361664000,,135,4.153846153846154
4096835,5,B00395ATT0,Awesome.  If you are in Downton Abbey withdrawal watch this instead.  You won't be disappointed as you are drawn in.,1361577600,,116,4.75
4096836,4,B00395ATT0,"Sweet and tender stories of the interactions of the people in a small English town and an even smaller hamlet. Quaint and amusing.  Occasionally it can get a tiny bit treacly, but not enough to ruin warm hearted feel.",1361577600,,217,4.564102564102564

4096838,5,B00395ATT0,I have thoroughly enjoyed this series and am hoping it will continue beyond Season 4.  I especially love the insight it provides.  Love the English accent and especially love Dorcus Lane.  I am facinated by how she speaks so eloquaintly.,1361491200,,237,4.875

4096841,5,B00395ATT0,It is refreshing to come across a story line the shows that family and community matters.  The characters are endearing and flawed just like people in our personal lives.  You'll love being transferred to a supplier time in life.  You can't help but be taken by this series.  Violence free: verbal and physical.  Get ready to be transported and connected to well developed characters.  The story line largely follows the internal voice of Laura Timmons who writes about her life and community.  This series is time well spent.,1361145600,,526,4.909090909090909
4096842,5,B00395ATT0,"I loved watching this entire series--all four seasons--on my iPad! The characters remained consistently charming and loveable from episode to episode, but grew emotionally in believable ways. The scenery and cinematography was breathtaking at times. A sweet, gentle, but real life problems show not meant for the reality tv-loving crowd.",1361145600,,337,5.76
4096843,5,B00395ATT0,"I really enjoy this beautifully created and wonderfully acted series. The characters are well-developed and fun to follow. There is a good balance between serious and funny to keep the stories moving along and pleasant to watch.

The wonderful regular characters are fantastic as well as the guest actors and characters. I loved the scenery, the costumes and the writing is excellent. We got so attached to so many characters and I find myself at times(even though it's been several weeks since I watched) wondering how Queenie and Twister are doing or thinking about the phenomenal Dorcas Lane. I really hated clicking on the very last episode as I did not want this story to end!",1360540800,,640,4.525862068965517

4096864,5,B00395ATT0,This is a terrific show like an English version of Little House on the Prairie. It is so nice to watch a show that portrays romance instead of graphic sexuality.,1360454400,,161,4.4

We slipped the first disc into our blu Ray player and nothing came up.  We tried several discs in the series and none would work in our player.  We tried a blu Ray movie which we have - and it played perfectly.

The shining lite in this comment is Amazon and how good they are to their customers.  I called with my complaint on the blu Ray disc and they were so kind and understanding.

But somehow in Season 3 this series went on autopilot.  Laura's going to fall in love with every young stranger who comes to town and get her heart broken.  Thomas Brown is going to find something to sputter incoherently about.  His wife will wear her perpetual dazed/confused expression.  Alf and his siblings will still be prating about happily (Parents?  What parents?).  Dorcas will respond to every situation with a series of pretty smiles and her feminine wiles.  I feel I've seen every expression Julia Sawalha has.

I have to agree with the person who complained about the music.  It's grating and for the last 12 eps I've had to mute the sound at the beginning and end because they play the same tiresome theme over and over.

It has become preachy telling us things that we would get from just watching the actions.  That means to me that the writers are not doing their job.  I don't like the 'women's equality' ...two .. yes TWO episodes!  As if we needed that now in this year of our lord...2012!  I find the missing people I've come to love rather annoying.  Some episodes have only the Candleford folk which eliminates a lot of the cast I love.  I'm tired of Twister who always seems to have some money though he doesn't work... odd and stupid scenes.

Laura has become more and more prudish as the series has gone on.  This last one I watched about the unions was really really annoying.

I want some human interaction.. not parables.  I might as well be reading Aesops Fables....only with them telling me exactly what they mean.

This particular story takes seemingly inconsequential struggles in life and shows how important (and absurd) these struggles can be. Extremely droll. Good if you're needing a bit of a lift or are in the mood for some character-driven comfort comedy. Nothing too challenging here, just a relaxing period bubble bath with some of the series' funniest characters!",1340928000,,502,5.0602409638554215
4096887,2,B00395ATT0,"I gave 5-star ratings to season 1 and 2 of this show; however, I just cannot do the same for season 3. The screenwriting has gone down the can, the flow and situations have become that of a bad Mexican tele-novela. The only saving graces are the acting cast and the on-location production/setting which is still beautiful as ever. But the show as-a-whole, sadly, has ""jumped the shark"" in season 3.

I'm by no means a TV production specialist, but here are a few things that, IMO, ""broke"" the show:

* Introduction/disappearance of character Nan
* Changing kid actor from one season to the next
* Laura (the character that everything revolves around of) who was portrayed as a maturing, blossoming, coming-of-age young lass for most of season 1 and 2, has now become a childish, naive, directionless character whose parents/Dorcas have to keep telling her what to do.
* The relationship between Dorcas and JD's son (Sidney) which was climatic in season 2, has suddenly become of background/side story without much import.
* Serious conflicts are resolved in such casual, unrealistic way that it becomes harder to empathize with the character (after all, you know by the end of the episode all will be well).
* The Pratt sisters have become caricatures (and that's saying a lot given that they were already caricature-ish).

In all, I'm fairly disappointed by the show changed in season 3.",1336435200,8,1388,4.872881355932203
4096888,5,B00395ATT0,"Season one of Lark Rise was splendid.  Season two was very good, but I felt it was not quite up to season one.  Now that I have finished season three, I must say that this is my favorite and what I consider the best season so far.

In this stately period drama (using the word drama loosely because this is as far from melodrama as the word drama can be), we continue to glimpse into the lives of the families of these two towns in the late 19th century Britain.  This series continues to impress me with the authentic story telling of these families.  On the one side, you have Lark Rise, a simple farming hamlet.  On the other side is Candleford, an up and coming town with a population tuned in to the affairs of the world at large.

In season three we see the Golden Lion Hotel flourishing.  One recurring guest star opens up a newspaper in Candleford.  But despite these changes, life mainly proceeds as it has.  People still have their interactions, their misunderstandings, quarrels, and tiffs.  But they also have camaraderie and spirit.  This is so well portrayed when measles strikes Lark Rise and the folks of Candleford come to help their neighbors.

The actors are magnificent in their portrayals of these characters.  The people haven't changed too much.  Their personalities are very well thought out.  I also enjoy that in this show a scandal involves something such as a woman wearing pants instead of a skirt.  This isn't the type of television one usually sees (people having relations all over the place, illegitimate kids, murders, etc...)  Instead, it is a tragic and shocking event when a person is sent to the debtors prison.  Even the story of a homeless wanderer catches the interest of the local paper and even the London papers.

The series is slow, stately, and well written and well acted.  I have enjoyed all three seasons so far and plan on enjoying season four (which is the final season so far - though there is a major uproar in Britain for a new series (season) five).  I highly recommend this series to fans of Downton Abbey or Cranford.",1335916800,,2074,4.609289617486339

4096893,5,B00395ATT0,"I've been a faithful fan of LRtC since Season One and just love this period drama centered on the inhabitants of the hamlet of Lark Rise and the town of Candleford. The casting is excellent, with a talented ensemble cast who add real depth to the characters portrayed, the stories are generally interesting with real human drama with all the pains and joys experienced by the inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford, and the cinematography is simply breathtaking.

Season Three sees the introduction of a significant new character, Daniel Parrish (played by Ben Aldridge), a young journalist who arrives in Lark Rise with some life-altering news for the Timmins. Emma (Claudie Blakley) might inherit a fortune, and both Emma and her husband Robert (Brendan Coyle) ponder the possibilities and opportunities this signifies for them as a family. Parrish is also drawn to Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) who has matured into a true beauty, but still harbors heartache from the break-up with clockmaker Fisher Price in Season 2.

The independent and strong-willed Dorcas Lane (played by the talented and lovely Julia Sawalha) continues as Candleford's postmistress, and experiences some human drama of her own, taking on a role that she finds fulfills her immensely. Unlike previous seasons, Dorcas' story is no longer the only dominant thread this season, as other characters begin to get more screen time (yes, I was not too pleased with this, but I felt some of these stories were still well done). One story arc which I particularly enjoyed watching was the marital adventures of postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) and his devoted wife Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade). Their antics just make me laugh out loud, and yet there is also a poignancy to their marriage which is explored later in the season. This balance makes them an interesting couple to watch on-screen and the actors outdo themselves in lending credibility and depth to their characters.

Minnie, the bumbling yet lovable maid from Season 2 is given a meatier role this season, and I loved how Dorcas takes Minnie under her wing, grooming her not for a life of servitude but for something far more worthy and fulfilling, with mixed results - a blend of hilarity and poignancy that had me laughing one moment and tearing up the next.

Strong and resilient Emma Timmins also gets a chance to explore other sides to her role - she is not just a loving mother and loyal wife this season, but yearns to be something more which I felt rounded-out her character very nicely this season. One of the story arcs I've loved throughout seasons 1-3 is the strong bond of love between Robert and Emma Timmins, one which is further explored this season.

The Pratt sisters, Ruby and Pearl (Victoria Hamilton and Matilda Zeigler) continue their roles as town busybodies and this season sees a major upheaval which threatens the sisters formerly close knit bond with each other. Young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh, also one of my favorite characters after Dorcas and Robert) begins to mature into his role as the head of his family, assuming real responsibilities, but also faces some serious and heartbreaking challenges.

This season also sees the inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford coming together in times of crisis, helping each other out, and setting aside their differences which I felt was timely and touching. The stories make you feel like you're there, experiencing these people's joys and pains, their triumphs and failures, and the slowly developing sense of community between both hamlets.

There are many other story threads this season that will engage viewers and keep them riveted to the screen. Is Season Three as good as Seasons 1 & 2? Well, on some counts yes, and others no, but the talented ensemble cast puts together another charming and poignant season to please viewers in general.

I also have Season Four. My only problem is that I can't stop watching them. It just isn't possible to watch them all in one sitting, but I would if I could. Then I could go on to see what happens next season.

4096904,4,B00395ATT0,"If you like me, desire and need from time to time, a little break from stark reality, this is the series for you.  After viewing seasons 1-3 of ""Lark Rise to Candleford"", I have come to the realization that I continue to view this British series mainly because it gives me some needed escape from my usual viewing (murder mysteries, detective shows, hard-hitting dramas, etc.).  Again, in Season three (3), of this well-directed and beautifully photographed BBC series, we are witness to some very, almost unbelievably, nice people.  These unbelievably nice, hard working, conscience and very wholesome people live and work in the gorgeous villages of Lark Rise and Candleford in England in early ""Victorian times"".  After viewing Season three (3) of this series,  I came to the conclusion that although, as in previous seasons, the stories in Season three (3) are set in the early 1800s, I really don't believe that life was as simple, easy and wholesome as this series makes it out to have been no matter how  beautiful the  locales.  We see no violence, sex, crime, dastardly happenings nor do we hear any ""bad"" language.

In Season three (3) there are only, to me, very mild annoyances to be dealt with.  All of these annoying problems happen mainly in and around the post office in Candleford where the head mistress is very sweetly (almost cloyingly sweet, at times) acted by Julia Sawalha, as Dorcas--Julia Sawalha also acted in ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""AB FAB""--the character is also the mentor of the narrator of the story, Julia Timmins, who is from an extremely wholesome family comprised of a ""know-it-all"", very hard working boarding on the ""self righteous"" father and a ""long-suffering"" tearful, multi-child-bearing, humble, ""very motherly"" mother along with devoted and loving siblings all living devoid of much money in Lark Rise--her memories form the basis of these stories.

 The problems that arise are solved by the extremely good citizens of the above mentioned villages with grace, good-will, tolerance and understanding, extreme love, determination, resolve, super niceness, kindness, concern, extreme caring, the singing of little tunes, a sip of beer and, of course, prayer plus the problems and annoyances are resolved without violence, bloodletting, mayhem, killings, revenge-murders for hire, chasing of the culprits, beatings, slapping or punching of same nor is there any cursing.  In other words, it is very safe to gather the entire family  to watch ""Lark Rise to Candleford"".

As I said before, I am sure that I continue to view this series mainly because it lets me have a few hours of escape from programs that are kind of based on what's real plus it's very well done and if you can ""buy"" or tolerate all of the goodness of the characters that are shown, it's well acted too.",1306972800,,2814,5.008583690987124

Having said that, this season did feel a bit more soap-opera-ish that the first two.  It felt like the writers were desperately contriving conflict to add drama.  Now, I know drama generally has conflict involved, but honestly...the writers were wringing it out in this season.  Every episode had not one, but several ""Oh NO!"" moments...seriously, at one point I started laughing because it was all too much.

Two thoughts: How come Robert Timmins is the only man in the village with any sense?  He always has to be the voice of reason for the Lark Rise mob.  It's kind of funny.  Also: Why is the serving girl SO incredibly stupid?  They play it as though it's funny, but she acts stupider than Forrest Gump or Corky (from Life Goes On).  Really, that character's IQ must be somewhere between 5 and 10.  It's not funny, it's embarrassing.",1298851200,,1066,4.6310160427807485

We see the gleaning after the harvest for the farmer, the terror over the possibility of not enough kernels to last each hamlet family through the winter.  We see a measles epidemic in Larkrise and its effect on Candleford neighbors.

I purchased this disc because I had a Panasonic DMP-BD30 player. Unfortunately, it would not play in my USA Panasonic player. I contacted 2Entertain in London, who released this Blu-Ray disc. They were very responsive and helpful. Initially they offered to send me a new disc but followed up within 30 minutes to say that they reacted too quickly because this disc had not been released in the USA. They passed my request on to another department who also corresponded with me.

A Google search led me to the source of the problem. This was not a Region problem as the disc is Region Free. The UK discs are authored at 50Hz unlike the USA disc releases which are at 60Hz. I searched the Blu-Ray Forum which has a list of the USA Blu-Ray players that support 50Hz. My player used to support 50Hz but this capability had been eliminated with recent firmware updates.

4096924,5,B00395ATT0,"I enjoy this series which carries the costume dramas, like Jane Austin works, into the realm of the average person.  After all not many of us would have been ""to the manor born,"" nor were our ancestors.  This collection is based on the novels of Flora Thompson, who wrote of her early life during the final decades of the 19th century.  Like the homely stories of Laura Ingalls Wilder who captured the same era and life in the rural America of the Midwest, those of Ms Thompson reveal the struggles of hard working farmers and small town shop keepers in England.

Each episode provides a colorful vignette of country life at the time, the tale of which generally focuses on some aphorism about life drawn from the narrator's father, mother, neighbor or simply something commonly said by many in the town.  The episode is often multi-lineal, with several characters undergoing some misfortune or minor triumph and with all of these various strands pulled together into a complete whole by the end of the story.  Usually after all is said and done and no matter how far afield each little subplot seems to have wandered, when the narrator repeats the maxim at the end, one realizes just how very true it was and in how many ways it proved to be so.

The delight of the entire thing is in the humanness of the characters and in the attention to detail; there are few references to the grander panorama of ""history"" as we are used to reading about it.  The most major event for these people is the coming of the railroad to a neighboring town and its likely effect on the local people and their economy.  The narrator's father is often the character that speaks for the rest of the world and the changes that are afoot beyond the borders of Lark Rise and Candleford.  While this may seem to present a very narrow portrait of the world, it is this perspective that most of us have, even today with mass communication and technology of a far higher order.  It is also this narrower view that is most real, since although history is written by ""experts"" about the high and mighty and what they did, it is experienced by individuals through the events of their lives.

What surprises me most is that both Laura Ingalls and Laura Timmins live lives that are so very similar despite their separation in space, the differences in their governments, the differences in their countries' histories.  It makes it far more apparent that technology and the demands of the environment are strongly deciding factors in the type of life we live no matter where we might be.",1297123200,,2553,4.621681415929204

Towards the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lark-Rise-to-Candleford-The-Complete-Season-Two/dp/B002VWOMZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season Two</a>&nbsp;the writing started making less sense and that continued and worsened in season 3.  I often found myself completely puzzled at characters doing things totally out of character or story lines that made no sense.

I found that I spent a good portion of my time just trying to ""get through it"" so I could see how it ended.  I would have given this 3 stars were it not for the last few episodes where Fisher returns.  He helped this season to end MUCH better than it otherwise would have although not as well as it could have if Laura had actually chosen him... but perhaps that's just my opinion. Either way, having him back improved the plot line as well as bringing some quality acting back since he and Laura have a chemistry she does not have with Daniel.

4096954,5,B00395ATT0,"This is one of the best series of programming there is today.  The stories and characters are so enchanting, you can hardly wait to see the next episode.  The scenery is so inviting that you almost want to step into that place. The time-period items of clothing, dwellings and charming tea kettles and teacups makes you look at more than the characters (whom are all excellent British actors).  My husband and I love to watch these stories together, as though they have become friends.  I highly recommend all three seasons to have in your home library.",1286928000,,553,4.729166666666667
4096955,5,B00395ATT0,"I always look forward to seeing Lark Rise to Candleford.
I surely hope that there will be a 4th season.
I do enjoy the quaint villages and beautiful countryside.
The characters are so interesting and it transports me back to a tranquil place in time. Jean",1286755200,,255,4.565217391304348
8391979,3,B00395ATT0,"For the most part, my husband and I are enjoying Lark Rise.  However, we absolutely squirm at the portrayal of people of faith (Christians).  The BBC tends to portray Christians as ridiculous, bigoted, prudish, stupid, extreme, etc.  They are rarely presented favorably or as even normal human beings.  Perhaps that is the way the Brits as a rule see Christians, but it gets very tiresome.",1528502400,,389,4.938461538461539
8391980,5,B00395ATT0,"I absolutely loved this series, especially Queenie and Alph.  My least favorites were Twister and Thomas Brown, but even they had their moments.  I wanted it to go on and on and was sad when it ended",1527465600,,199,4.351351351351352
8391981,5,B00395ATT0,"I love this series.  There is such a good variety of  characters and they play their parts well.  I wanted to see more and was disappointed when the series stopped with episode 6 of season 4.  It was advertised as going on, but I could not get any more to download. I wanted to see more of Laura's life.",1526428800,,303,4.084745762711864
8391982,5,B00395ATT0,Love this series from beginning to end  and  would truly love to see a remake of all the marriages and new babes to come...I wold follow this forever if it went on forever. It has captivated my heart in such a way I never want to let it go. I loved this series and saddenend it was only 4 of them.....would love to see a remake to follow the journeys of their new live with marriages  and new children and such!  Oh I could it over and over for there series have surely touched my heart in such a wonderful way I don't want to let it go,1522368000,,536,3.935185185185185
8391983,2,B00395ATT0,Became tiresome and tedious for me after watching a couple of seasons. Stopped watching.,1516752000,,88,5.357142857142857
8391984,3,B00395ATT0,"I love this gentle and delightful show, it reminds me of little house on the prairie British style and for a more mature audience. But at some episodes it felt like something's missing and when I checked the length of the original episodes it seems that amazon cut off about 10 minutes from each episode. Why, oh why? Why can't you just play the full length? Boo, taking off 2 starts for what I would otherwise consider a 5 star show.",1516579200,,434,4.37037037037037
8391985,5,B00395ATT0,"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my mom. Im giving it 5 stars because she loves it. Personally, I liken its presence to an ice pick lodged in my optical nerve.",1515369600,,160,4.193548387096774
8391986,2,B00395ATT0,"Getting quite tedious now.  Too many weak storylines.  New and seemingly important characters are dispatched quickly and predictably so much so that you don't really want to invest in any new arrivals on the show.  And because this version of the show (compared to the original BBC broadcast)
 is so mercilessly edited and condensed that every episode seems to fly by, leaving the viewer shaking their head with unanswered questions, unresolved plot lines, loose ends!",1514246400,,468,5.2
8391987,5,B00395ATT0,"Love, love, love it! From the cinematography to the complexity of the characters, this is a treat! As one reviewer said, it is a show that simply makes you feel good. I would add that you will become quite attached to the female characters and their male counterparts.",1507161600,,268,4.604166666666667
8391988,2,B00395ATT0,"Key scenes are missing from MANY of these episodes. What a shame. I loved the original PBS series, but this series on Amazon Prime has dozens of memorable scenes totally removed.",1500249600,,178,4.774193548387097
