4985247,3,B006FR7W0I,this is an intense work out not for the faint of heart. I have been watching only the beginner video and doubt if I will be ready for the next one for a long time. there is some less intense options shown but not enough. I am 64 and only been doing aqua arobics and 50 lbs overweight,1325030400,39,283,3.896551724137931
4985248,2,B006FR7W0I,"I was excited to get the Pink Method after watching the ""Sales Pitch"" on Dr. Phil. After getting set up in my exercise room and starting with the Beginners workout I was shocked that you were expected to do Plank push-ups in the beginners course. I am over 50, but have been working out for years, I was really hoping the exercise videos would be more doable. If you are looking for an exercise program that gently works you into a routine, this is not the one for you.",1324252800,156,469,4.280898876404494

It is worth every dime I paid for it and I have tried just about all the diets out there. Don't let the price scare you away. It is about the same cost as going to the gym for a couple months. I give this five stars for all you get in the pack!",1322870400,27,519,3.727272727272727

4985251,5,B006FR7W0I,"I did exactly what the book said as far as diet and smoothies. I did the same with the work outs. After ten days, I lost ten pounds. By the time I got to the rest area (you don't exercise for a few days) I had lost twenty pounds. Could I get through the whole exercise routine, no, but I still firmed up and lost the weight. If you like green vegetables, you won't have a problem with the diet. If it works for a fifty nine year old, it'll work for you.",1428192000,5,453,3.881720430107527

4985255,5,B006FR7W0I,I don't know what people are whining about. This is not a workout for those who have never worked out in your life and the moves that are created for beginners are totally doable. People are just lazy and they don't want to try the workouts that are alloted to you. It's nice and fun!,1400544000,5,284,4.181818181818182
4985256,5,B006FR7W0I,I purchased this after seeing it on Dr. Phil in 2011. I lost 7 lbs the first week and 2-3lbs consistently there after. I agree that the exercise is a little 'extra' but I do what I can then do other things like play soccer with my kids and kickboxing. In 2011-2012 with the help of a gym membership I went from 175 to 130. My goal weight was 140 but I just keep losing. I recently moved to NJ (june 2013) from FL and now I'm 160lbs!!! So I'm on the PINK diet again....because IT REALLY WORKED! I'll try to remember to update you guys again in a couple of months.,1395705600,3,562,4.026785714285714
4985257,5,B006FR7W0I,"I have done the pink method twice now (first time I lost 30+ pounds and a ridiculous amount of inches).  Be prepared however to do a lot of squats and lunges.  If you have bad knees, probably not the best option for you.  The ""diet"" plan really consists of a protein shake right after your workout and eating healthy and minimalizing carbs... pretty standard.  I'm doing this now for the second time after two years and a pregnancy.  Best of luck to you!",1388966400,2,454,4.421686746987952
4985258,4,B006FR7W0I,"I bought this kit from the PINK website in late 2010.  I read through everything, watched the workout videos, thought about it all for a couple months, then through that holiday season I virtually stuffed myself sick with everything I wouldn't be able to eat while following this method.  January 2011 I was 187 lbs and more than ready to commit to a total dietary change.  I lost 7 lbs in the first week of the reset, which was very encouraging.  After 5 months I had lost 36 lbs and only had 10 more to go to reach my goal weight.  I wasn't able to do the workouts, so for exercise I did yoga and a lot of walking/hiking.
Unfortunately, I plateaued with those 10 lbs left.  I don't care much for cooking or baking, but holiday season 2012 I got the strange urge to bake and ended up going back to a lot of my old eating habits.
Now it's January 2014 and I've gained back 20 lbs and am ready to lose that, plus the 10 I didn't manage to lose the first time around!  The main thing I learned from the PINK method is that my weight issues are primarily caused by overeating.  Portion control is my big obstacle!  I eat much healthier now than I did prior to 2011, so eating the wrong foods is a very secondary issue for me.  Another thing I learned is that once I totally eliminated the 'bad' stuff, the cravings went away pretty quickly and it didn't bother me to see other people eating those things....EXCEPT chips and fries!  (My almost 50 yr old husband eats like a 12 yr old and has no intention of changing.)
Other than that, I could care less if I never ate pasta or bread again in my life, I quit drinking soda and can't stand the taste of it now, and I'm perfectly satisfied with a small square of super-dark chocolate as my 'sweet treat'.  I did have to teach myself to like drinking water, because I REALLY hated it before and you have to drink a lot with this eating plan (divide your weight by 2 and drink that many ounces/day).
After the first month, I found I could easily eat a protein and veggie meal with a glass of water at a restaurant and not feel like I was missing out on anything....except the wine or cocktail. :)  And I was able to do that while traveling/eating out a lot, and continued to lose weight.
I like this eating plan, it worked for me and, as stated above, I'll be starting it again today.",1388620800,6,2326,4.223476297968397
4985259,5,B006FR7W0I,I absolutely love this product.  It gives you all that you need to help you life a healthier lifestyle and then some.,1385596800,2,117,4.318181818181818
4985260,5,B006FR7W0I,"Man, the reviews for this program are all over the place with half the people totally demonizing it and the other half loving it.  The outrageous price that Amazon has this listed at is not helping either.  Getting lost in all of this hype and overcharging is one of the best ""clean food"" diet plans I have found along with a series of dvds that can toe to toe with anything put out by Beachbody.

I will talk about the DVDs first.  You get four DVDs: one for each of the three levels and one for the bonus workouts.  Each dvd has three work outs on it.  Level one - all three work outs are 18 - 20 minutes each.  The workouts are Kardio, Strength Pull and Strength Push.  Level two - each program is 25 - 28 minutes.  The workouts are Kardio, strength lower body and strength upper body. Level three - each program is 35 - 40 minutes.  The workouts are Kardio, Strength Pull and Strength Push.  The bonus dvd is not really a ""bonus"" but instead are part of the primary program and you do one of them EVERY time you exercise.  Each program is 15 minutes.  The workouts are Athletic Abs, Mat lower body (pilates style for lower body and core) and Yoga Core.  Each level is taught be a single instructor and they each do one of the bonus routines.  The instructors are all very knowledgeable and motivating. The instructors cue very well and remind me of classic FIRM dvd  instructors.

For thirty days you do one of the three programs on Level 1 plus the add-on workout for six days with one day for rest.  You are exercising little over 30 minutes for the first level.  The Kardio is a toughie and not ""beginner"" in that it is purposely designed to to condition you so that your fitness ablitiy increases to point you are able to handle longer exercise periods.  The key to making this program work for you is to keep telling yourself it is just 18 minutes.  The idea is to really push for those 18 minutes so your conditioning goes up and you will be amazed at how good it makes you feel if you have never really pushed yourself in an exercise program before. The push and pull are pretty standard cardio and weight training routines very similar in style and level to Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred. (Note: for more advanced exercisers you can do all three dvds for an excellent full body and cardio workout in about 55 minutes.)

The Next 30 days is level two and for the first two weeks you again do one of the Level 2 exercises and one of the bonus for total of approximately 40 minutes.  The intensity is little higher and the workouts ten minutes longer.  Again you have one cardio routine which uses light weights to keep heart rate up.  The big difference is the toning programs are broken down into lower body and upper body.  The third week in this level you start moving from the regular formula and the length of time of exercising starts to vary.  One day you might do 2 of the level 2 programs for approximately 55 minutes and the next all three of the bonus dvds for 45 minutes.  The intensity level here is around Jillian Micheal's harder 45 minute dvds, the Pink Firm dvds or Shaun T's T25.

The last level takes the biggest time crunch and the workouts are tough but at this point you should be well conditioned and your body more adjusted to the diet so a bigger push will be needed to continue to see results.  These workouts really vary the times and are between 30 - 80 minutes and are designed to ""confuse"" your body with different lengths of training times and  intensity.  The cardio is mix of kickboxing and plyometrics.  The Push and Pull are the dreaded Tabata training that is all the rage now.  (Tabata means you perform an activity at max intensity for 20 seconds and recover for ten and rinse and repeat.) Inanity and Cathe exercisers will feel challenged on this level.

As good as the dvds are, for me the real worth of this program is the plan food diet.  This is an easy to prepare diet plan that uses real simple food and it is great for a single busy person like myself and could be easily done by a working mom who has to prepare separate/different food for her family.  You can follow the plan exactly and use the 82 day menu religiously or you can wing it with the ""blueprint"" guide and list of allowed foods.  And speaking of foods, there is nothing expensive or so fancy you have to be a chef.  Sample day:  Breakfast: 1/2 oatmeal, cup raspberries and cup green tea.  Lunch: 4 oz chicken breast, steamed or grilled zucchini and 1/2 cup brown rice.  Dinner: 4 oz. beef tenderloin, green beans and medium sweet potato.  If you have a rice cooker, vegetable steamer and George Forman type grill then you are all set.  You will also need a good blender to make the smoothies which you will be having for breakfast and post workout snacks a lot.  Most ""exotic"" foods on diet are couscous, quinoa, kale, arugula and few times tofu pops up but you can substitute that. The spices and seasonings one review moaned over being exotic and expensive are basil, dill, garlic, ginger, oregano and rosemary!  The diet does list ""Bragg's liquid Amino's"" which is healthy soy sauce and is carried by Walmart and Amazon and even that is not necessary.  Most stores now carry a ""store-brand"" Stevia that is almost the same price as the artificial sweeteners.  Yes, you will have to cook your own meals and take your lunches with you to work.  Yes, you might have to actually chop your veges.  If times is real big issue then on either Saturday or Sunday chop everything up and prepare your grains for the week.  When steaming my veges, I will place four or five servings of meat on top (like three chicken breasts and two pieces of fish) so I get the flavors of the meats on my veges and have several meals ready in case I get home late at night or do not have time in morning to cook my lunch.

The last thing I want to talk about is the much criticized Pink Reset portion of the diet.  Yes, if you break this down to calories you probably are talking about around 800.  This low calorie part or VLCD is meant to RESET your body and is supposed to be a shock and act as a cleanse.  The idea is to jump start your weight loss so you get excited about the program.  Also, the idea is to ""shrink"" your stomach so you get used to the smaller portions and to detox off all the bad stuff you were eating. If you eat a lot of processed and fast foods then this will be a shocker.  YOU DO NOT EXERCISE DURING THIS PERIOD.  You are eating whole food with UNLIMITED vegetables but no fruit except in smoothies and no grains. Yes, it is slow calories but it is high nutrients and you will not starve to death.  The number of days you stay on the reset diet depends on your starting weight and height and varies from 3 - 14 and you stop sooner after you lose between 5 - 10 pounds.  You will go back on the Reset for four days before you start levels 2 and 3.  There is also the 7-Day Shred for when you are 5 - 10 pounds from your goal or hit a plateau. IF A VLCD IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU THEN JUST DO THE REGULAR DIET INSTEAD or add more veges.",1377475200,61,7055,4.295230885692657
4985261,4,B006FR7W0I,"I like the fact that these workouts are relatively fast. I was doing P90X for awhile, but those are all 1 - 1/2 hrs 6 days a week. I just don't always have time for that. I am 54 and I am not sure I should keep doing so much especially 6 days a week, plus I just don't have that much time to devote to it.
The PINK method seems somewhat similar to what I was doing, but much more abbreviated. There are 2 different types of weight days and cardio. There are three different levels plus a bonus CD with abs, etc. the only thing I don't care for is that some of it is high impact, they do give modifications though and I always modify for myself anyway to protect my knees. I am sure for someone younger that doesn't mind high impact it would be fine. Overall, it seems to be a well done exercise method with different instructors which helps with the boredom factor.",1374105600,5,865,4.124260355029586
4985262,3,B006FR7W0I,"I have never written a review before but felt this needed one. I absolutely loved the workouts, they are short enough for a working, single mother like myself to fit in and challenging enough to work up a sweat. If it gets to easy, I increase the weights I use. As far as the meal plan goes, I had severe headaches every day for a week when I tried the reset. All the PINK message boards said it was the caffine and sugar etc withdrawals. Well I agree with the sugar but I still had my black coffee every day and I feel like it was the very low calories intake on the reset that brought the headaches on. I totaled my calories up for the reset day I had done and it was around 700 calories. To low in my option and goes against everything I have read, granted I'm not a certified fitness pro or anything but I personally need more then 700 calories a day. I do not follow the food plan, just a modified version of it and am much happier on that!!",1368403200,2,946,4.064171122994653
4985263,2,B006FR7W0I,"I bought this after watching it on ""The Doctors"" and really regretted it. I am a big fan of Beachbody workout DVDs and this one was way too easy for me. If you're a beginner this would be perfect. But the programs were only 20 minutes and I barely sweated. I tried to push as hard as I could and still couldn't get much of a workout out of it.

Also if you're not used to exercising you might get lost in some of the camera angles. They kept switching angles right in the middle of the workout.",1367452800,3,494,4.040816326530612
4985264,5,B006FR7W0I,"The P.I.N.K. Method is amazing!  However, you must follow all advice that the ladies give.  It's more than just a workout and eating plan.  Anyone giving this bad reviews didn't do it long enough and probably treated it like a quick fix.  I lost 45lbs in three months while following the eating plan and exercises.  When I started to stray from these, I still continued to lose weight because I ate more veggies and drank more water without even thinking about it. P.I.N.K. Method changed my life.  Also, I lost the 45lbs over a year ago and haven't gained any weight back. I have more energy than I did in high school and I'm healthier than I have ever been!

4985265,4,B006FR7W0I,"This particular diet is restrictive and time consuming.  So far it has been effective in my losing some weight, but many of the products/food ingredients are not commonly used and quite expensive to purchase.  The exercises recommended are beyond my endurance level and I have chosen other, less rigorous regimens.",1362096000,5,314,5.26
4985266,4,B006FR7W0I,"I am 37 years old and heard about this from a friend who has lost almost 80 pounds in less than a year. Due to lifestyle changes I have packed on about 15 pounds in the last few years and tried everything to remove them. When I bought this (from the website, I don't know why it's so much here)I was very frustrated with the expensive and totally useless Alli Diet. I am about 1/2 way through day 16 and so far so good. I loved the reset, and after the first few days, the very restrictive calories became no problem to eat and I actually felt much better than being on a previous diet of CRAP where not only was I fat, but continually crashing and spiking during the day. The best part was it WORKS. On the reset the scale moved EVERY DAY, making it much easier to skip the french fries the next day. I agree with the others here that the workouts aren't for beginners, but I just told myself that I didn't have to look like the ladies on the video (yet) and kept up as best I could. The diet is easy to follow once you get the hang of it, and I feel so much better that I am less likely to reach for a doughnut. I am also a vegetarian, and there are many recipes that don't include meat. So, this has been 5 stars for me! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that these are suppose to be for others who are looking to buy. This does take a lot of time and planning, it is genuinely a change of LIFESTYLE and if you don't have at least a 1/2 hour a day to measure and fill jugs of water, plan and pack meals to cook and take to work, and cook something else for any one else in your life who depends on you, this diet will be hard to stick to. Also, protein powders and organic foods can be expensive, and a little tricky to find, so grocery shopping takes some doing. I decided to start now because I don't have much on my calendar for the next few months. If your schedule involves much travel or reasons you need to eat in a restaurant in your future you may want to do this later.  Other than that, this program has delivered EVERY promise it made so far! Good luck! Go Girls!",1347062400,4,2081,4.002403846153846
4985267,5,B006FR7W0I,"Let me start by saying that NO diet works unless you work the diet! I have started and failed at many diets....I had given up hope of ever being at a healthy weight. I watched the Dr. Phil episode and decided to give it a shot, I ordered it straight from the website for 70 bucks....which I guess some people would think is expensive, I looks at it as about two months gym membership. I started the plan on 1-14-12 at 319lbs. Today is 8-20-12 and I currently weigh 241....so I am down 78lbs in 7 months....and still going strong. Is the food plan restrictive....at first, yes. But that is for a good reason.....americans are addicted to C.R.A.P. (caffeine, refined sugar, alcohol, and processed foods) Being on reset give you the opportunity to detoxify your self from all of the C.R.A.P. and you must also reset your mind so that you no longer accept processed foods as ""healthy"" because they aren't. Once you have reset your eating habits, your mind, etc....the plan is EASY to follow.....eat healthy foods, real foods.....not processed, chemical ridden, food-like products! If you want a diet that makes you believe you can continue to eat C.R.A.P. and still lose weight, you are fooling yourself....it will NEVER work! This is a lifestyle change. Cynthia Pasquella, the creator of the the PINK Method has done a wonderful job of educating women on a lifestyle change that will allow them to get to a healthy weight. If you take the education and apply the principles to your life...YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.....if you don't then you will be just another quitter giving a bad review to an amazing program. And while it is marketed to women, my husband has lost 100lbs following the plan with me.",1345420800,10,1696,4.733108108108108
4985268,5,B006FR7W0I,"You really can't be a couch potato to be able to complete these workouts. I did P90 (NOT P90X), and that really helped me gain strength and endurance for the P.I.N.K. METHOD. The workout packs a lot into just 20-30 minutes, depending on what phase you're on. It is a total body workout each day. I love that each day has meals already planned out. No guesswork in what to eat for each meal.  While I am not overweight, I like the results I am seeing to get a toned lean body.  You won't be disappointed. And for less than $70, you get a full diet and exercise program.

I definitely recommend this program for those who are truly motivated and dedicated to having a healthy lifestyle.  It takes serious hard work and dedication to make changes.  NO EXCUSES, JUST RESULTS!",1343606400,,771,4.439716312056738

I may quit for a week or a few days but I always go back to it everytime.  I would eat pizza, junk, drink beer and when I have had enough of that I will start the diet/workout again and slim down right to where I left off in about 3 days.  I have never been in better shape in my life.  The book alone is the best nutrition plan out there.  It is all about natural foods and will stop you from craving and being so hungry all the time.  It really does work and I tell everyone about it.  It is difficult but it is because it gives you such fast results.  It is worth every single penny.  It's also very therapeutic and it makes you very proportionate, flexible, and fit not bulky muscular.  You will look very sexy very soon and love it!

A girlfriend of mine lost 60 lbs on this after she had a baby and I thought I'd give it a try. I'm not going to lie, the first week was brutal. I almost had to have my husband carry me up the stairs because my thighs hurt so bad but the after the second week I couldn't believe how many squats I could do and the pain was gone. I'm on phase three and down 30lbs. I'll break down the program
Phase 1: 3 - 14 days a simple cleanse with no - moderate workouts. Basically you have a protein shake and fruit for breakfast and eat healthy all day... really easy
Phase 2: 3 weeks add a workout regimen. It's VERY difficult at first so don't expect to get through a whole work out without pausing. Work outs are 30 - 45min
Phase 3: 3 weeks Kick up the work out a little bit. Lots of lunges and you start focusing on your arms a little more. I was able to start doing push-ups without being on my knees during this phase!! Work outs are 45-60 min
Phase 4: 3 weeks Work outs get a little more intense and weight literally just fell off me during this phase.
Phase 5: another cleanse - I haven't started this yet
The exercises switch up every day so you never get board and you do 2 - 3 workouts a day which can be broken up or done all at once.
The only cons are they don't really explain what vitamins or supplements you should take so I just stick with a multivitamin and I travel a lot for work so it's difficult to stick to because you need free weights. Otherwise I HIGHLY recommend this product if you are serious about making a change.",1342656000,2,1675,4.141104294478527

It is not for the people who expect weight to just magically fall off. It's hard work and it's all about a lifestyle change. Whole foods, not processed switching from dairy milk to almond and coconut milks. Any diet can work and yes this is nothing new. It was however the ONE for me and I have never felt better in my life. I'm 12lbs away from my goal of 135 - I'm 5' 6"" and I'm so proud. I have formed lifelong friendships with other women on the program.

Not only have I lost pounds and inches but I've gained something I never had in my ""skinny"" days...muscle tone.  I can see the muscles in my biceps, triceps and thighs without flexing.  While I still have quite a bit of belly to get rid of I can also see ab definition coming through.

One word of advice, definitely purchase this from the pink method website, if you pay in one installment it's only $68, the price on here is outrageous.",1332806400,8,918,4.3274853801169595

However I have been highly disappointed in their promise of continuous on line support. On 2 occassions my site has failed following server upgrades on their part. I am now on day 6 of having major portions of my on line support web page being nonfunctional. I am experiencing a poor response to my problem from Pink. If you rely on on line support, meal tracking, activity monitoring or other technical support you may find it to be sporadic, less than promised and disappointing.",1332115200,,606,4.62037037037037
4985277,3,B006FR7W0I,"My rating is probably closer to 3.5.

I will start off by saying if you want this product, purchase direct from the manufacturer. It's half the price (or less) and the purchase was hassle free. No tricks to try and upsell you on other products.

As for the ""method""  itself, it really isn't anything new. Low fat, low carb, moderate protein, fresh vegetables, and exercise. That's the ""method"" in a nutshell. The plan is a bit more involved. It consists of generally of 2 parts. Part one is the ""Reset"" which I would describe as a jumpstart. The second part, ""Pink Primary"" is the longterm plan.

""Reset"" which, according to an interview (?) I saw with the author is to provide quick results and thus motivation for the user. It involves fairly severe calorie restriction for 7-14 days depending on your starting weight.  The more weight you want/need to lose the longer you stay on ""Reset"". There is emphasis on NOT counting calories, but my curiosity got the best of me and I calculated that ""Reset"" calls for approx. 700-900 calories a day depending on food choices and amount of snacking (fresh, raw veggies only). It's not a surprise one sees rapid loss during this period.

After ""Reset"", you start ""Primary"" which has three phases which are related to a change in exercise, not food. (Though ""Primary"" allows the reintroduction of  more ""good carbs/""starches and thus, ultimately, a higher caloric intake. On ""Reset"" carbs came only from fruit and vegetables.). The meal plans remain the same, but exercise intensity and duration (DVD levels) change roughly every 30 days. So, you eat according to ""Primary"" guidelines and do level 1 DVD for 30 days. Go on a mini ""Reset"" for 4 days then move to level 2 DVD for the next 30 days. Afterward, another 4-day ""Reset"" it's on to level 3.

My guess, since I haven't completed a full 90 days yet, is you repeat until your down to the last 5 lbs then you kick it up several notches and do the ""7-Day Shred"".

In general, I love that the book/plan offers a full 90+ days of meal plans. If you don't like the choices, you can use the ""blueprint"" instead. (Protein + Veggies + Slow Carbs). It also offers lists of foods to choose from. Though, it also notes that the lists offered aren't exhaustive. There are also many more recipes available on the plan's online community to which you get access once you've purchased the plan.  Though the overwhelming majority of the folks there are helpful, sympathetic and supportive, there are a few who are not. But, alas, that is the nature of online communities.

My disappointment with the program falls into two areas - the plan itself and results.  First  the plan. There are quite a few contradictions in the plan. For example, on ""Reset"" the book says fats are a ""no-no"" but you're allowed to use vegetable cooking spray, low-calorie salad dressing and reduced-fat mayonnaise.  No soy, but the required ""Reset"" breakfast is a protein shake. The one whey protein product advertized on the website contains soy. These small details nagged at me. But more than that I became very wary when I realized I was supposed to eat under 1000 calories a day for up to 14 days. Everything I've ever read said that was a ""no-no"".

My own results have been mixed, I guess. Lost a pound a day the first 7 days of  ""Reset"". The next 7 days, I lost only about  a pound and a half the entire week. Since then, I've been gaining and losing the same 2-3 pounds. (Very common occurrence according to the posters on the Community Boards). Though, I've been losing inches.  Ultimately, contrary to the author's intentions, quickly losing weight only to end up at a ""scale standstill"" it a lot more discouraging long term than the fast weigh loss was encouraging.

Anyway....

If you can get past all the hype, ignore some of the detail inconsistencies and mellow out your expectations, the plan does offer some good information. Though, it's nothing particularly new or revolutionary. And you'll still have to work for it to work.",1330560000,42,4000,4.687142857142857
4985278,4,B006FR7W0I,"Years ago I did P90 (P90X was not available at that time) and had some good results but eventually lost interest and stopped working out.
In my mid-50s, I tried to ""wish myself"" back into exercising again. Each year became more difficult to get motivated. I bought a few products/DVDs that were a waste of money due to my lack of follow through, not because they didn't work.
I saw the PINK Method on Dr. Phil and thought ""what the heck"". Something in this exercise program clicked with me and I have been using the DVDs and working out. I'm 58 and started Phase 1 at my own pace and gradually stepped it up. I am just starting Phase 2, which has slightly longer workouts. Again, I started at my own pace then I'll work to meet the challenge. Each Phase shows modifications for beginners and the hard core ladies.
Online there's a journal for your use. You can keep it private or share it with friends in the PINK community. You can track your weight and measurements. Wish I had taken a ""before"" photo! There's a calendar schedule to keep you on track with your workouts and if you miss a day, you can reset the calendar. There's a Community for those who like to post and discuss issues with other PINK ladies. The meal plans are balanced and I use them as guidelines.
I am happy with the PINK Method program and would purchase it again. Maybe you can watch for a special promotion or a little better price.",1330300800,9,1409,4.402298850574713
4985279,5,B006FR7W0I,"I bought the P.I.N.K Method 2 weeks ago and I love it! I've lost 12 pounds already! I'm not a big fan, however, of the Pink Drink with Whey in it so I used Hemp Protien powder instead and loved it!

Menu: As far as the menu goes there are quite alot of things allow for you to eat. Find the individually wrapped fish and chicken that are vaccuum sealed. This is what I do since my family won't be eating what I eat. It's super convieniant. I find there is a great variety of options for a dinner. You don't have to follow the meal plan to a 'T' either. take inventory of the lists, and mix and match!! The recipes are geard towards a vegan diet (which I definately am NOT), so I use skim milk rather than almond milk or coconut milk or whatever. Just be sensible about what you substitute.

Exercise DVD's: I am a stay at home mom, but I never did much exercising (ok...none at all), and I weigh 269 pounds so I am not the fittest duck in the pond. The beginnign exercise DVD (which is the only one I've gotten to yet) isn't easy for me to do. It's a challenge. That's what it's supposed to be. The DVD offers variations for the workout, but I find that I don't need them 80% of the time. Bottom line: I'm not fit as a fiddle and the exercises are within my reach (even with bad knees and a back low back). :)

This program starts off really strict but gradually adds back in certain foods to your diet which helps you because as the time goes on, you learn how to eat properly. You don't stay on this forever, it helps you lose the weight you want to and keep it off. It just helps you re-program your mind and it's relationship with food. You have to want to do it, it isn't easy.

Other than their special ""pink"" protein shake drinks, this is your basic low-carb, low-fat diet, low-calorie diet.  Nothing  new or revolutonary, just plain old-fashioned solid low calorie nutrition. You can save your money and just buy whey protein powders in all sorts of flavors if you are into drinking a high protein ""smoothie"" for breakfast.  You are apparently expected to follow their daily meal plan to a ""T"".  Not in the mood for tonight's scheduled dinner or don't like something on it (or don't have some of the more exotic ingredients)...?  Well, too bad (although you can always repeat last night's dinner...).

As far as the exercise DVDs go, their definition of ""beginner""  and ""doable"" for everyone are different than for many of the rest of us.  I know many people who would struggle quite a bit with the beginning level of exercise, especially people with joint issues.

There is nothing BAD or UNSOUND about this plan, but they are charging a LOT of money for info that is readily available elsewhere for free, and many people who have a significant amount of weight to lose, have joint problems, or have just been very sedentary for a long time will likely struggle with (and probably give up on) the exercise.",1326672000,11,1346,4.762931034482759

8497157,4,B006FR7W0I,"First, it worked for me.  I lost 30 pounds.  Not quickly--10 pounds quickly, then the slow, agonizing process of the next 20 took about 8 months.  I felt I was getting fitter and healthier the whole time, but the weight loss was slow (as is usual for me, sadly).

The book is not very good.  It's new-agey and ""pc"" and not in line with my values.  For instance, it ties to motivate by asking if you want to feel good walking naked in front of your ""lover.""  It focuses a lot on helping you feel and look ""sexy.""  I want to be healthy and I want to look good.  I want to fit into my cute clothes and not feel like an overweight mom.  I want to feel energized.  ""Sexy"" is not what I am interested in, so it doesn't resonate with me.  There are a lot of confusing things and contradictions in the book. There is some crude language.  There are typos and mistakes and inaccuracies.  Judging by the content of the book, I would have thought I would really dislike the author, but she turned out to be a kind, personable, down-to-earth breastfeeding mom.  (Yes, new-agey and vegan, but I liked her.  She's gone a bit off the deep end into the new-agey nonsense since creating the PINK method, but oh, well.)

I was able to follow the program by finding groups, blogs, recipes, and support online.  Using the book alone would not have worked.  There are very few recipes and meal suggestions in the book.  What the author said online (""no, you can't eat pickles, what would make you think that is okay?"") often contradicts what is printed in the book (there is a recipe including pickles!).  Like I said, I actually watched the author's live Q&A sessions and discussed the program with others online to figure out how to even do the meal part.  The book seems to have been rushed to print without good fact-checking or editing.

The best part about the program is the exercise videos.  The exercise programs are HARD.  They offer modifications for advanced and beginners, but at all levels, they are hard.  They are more enjoyable than many other exercise programs I have tried (I HATE exercise), and I had sore muscles after the first session.  They do involve planking, so anyone with abdominal separation or back problems may want to skip those exercises.

Did this 3 years ago, and now plan to do it again.  I am going to try to re-lose what I lost and then gained back (plus some :-( ) by using the exercise program (skipping most scheduled rest days, but allowing myself to skip exercise when I just can't fit it in).  I won't do the ""RESET"" at the start (it's just extreme calorie restriction with no sugar or carbs...veggies and protein except for the fruit in the one daily smoothie).  I will focus on salads, veggies, small portions of protein, the yummy smoothies (a reward for doing the exercise), plenty of water, an occasional detox bath, some non-New Agey visualization/meditation, and see where it goes.

Some of the journal was helpful (I still have my doubts about weighing daily...what if the scale goes up and down like it does for me--it can be really discouraging to see a 2 pound gain from the day before even if I KNOW that's what my body does).  I plan on weighing once or twice a week and measuring at the end of each phase and not doing everything in the journal.  I may combine some recipes from other diets and modify to fit PINK better.

Fruit will be my ""treats,"" and when I am desperate, I found a blog that includes some desserts that fit the PINK plan (technically...fruit, stevia, nut flour, almond milk, etc.).  I think cutting out processed foods and sugar helps me a lot, but I have never been able to stick to a strict diet like PINK forever.",1429488000,3,3674,4.480421686746988
