8130138,5,B000GAT0QY,"This is a rare tape that you should snag quickly for the unbeatable price and the unbeatable cartoons. It took me years to find all 3 volumes of this that was released in the early 80s. Don't go for the Columbia House DVD set. It's edited to the point of uselessness. Same goes for the VHS releases over the years, 'cept for ""The World of Andy Panda,"" ""Wild and Woody,"" and ""Woody Woodpecker: The Collectors Edition Vol 2."" This first

the tapes from back in the day still has the best cartoons on it as a

whole and I reccomend it the most.

""The Screwdriver"" - Awesome cartoon with a 40s era Woody teaching a jerk cop a lesson.

""The Poet and Peasant"" - Funny musical cartoon that was directed by Dick Lundy. It's also crisp and timed perfectly to the music. Musical cartoons like these are few. It's a shame that the Lantz cartoons aren't marketed like other vintage cartoons because they too are great.

""Wacky-Bye Baby"" - A little weaker because Woody plays a leeching bum here but still kind of funny.

""Fish Fry"" - Funny Andy Panda cartoon with a cool ending.

""Woody Dines Out"" - Also a little weak but still pretty good. Woody mistakes a taxidermy place for a restaurant and goes in.

""The Loose Nut"" - Another that's a tad weak because Woddy's a jerk here but it's ok.

""Sh-h-h-h-h-h"" - An absolutely genious cartoon by the genious Tex Avery. He usues silence as a gag here. I can't do this cartoon justice. You must see it. I hope it doesn't give you nightmares...because it could.

""Convict Concerto"" - Another perfectly timed musical cartoon. This one comes off as so well that after the 7 minutes, you feel like you've just finished a movie. It's Woody's best.",1169251200,,1674,4.4950495049504955
