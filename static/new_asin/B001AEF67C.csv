8277201,5,B001AEF67C,"School Rumble is one of my favorite Anime shows. Classic high school drama, but trust me its not what you think. This show has a lot of heart even when the craziest of things happen. You can relate to all of these characters I relate most to harima, and trust me he will be your favorite character of all.",1391731200,,305,4.186440677966102
8277202,4,B001AEF67C,"The show itself is pretty darn funny, even though it is not plot driven like I usually prefer. The situations are wacky, and there is a classic over-reactiveness from the characters when things go wrong (which they always do). The show is fairly appropriate for young audiences, but the words ""bastard"" and ""bad ass"" tend to come up fairly often. Not enough to make the show PG13, but certainly enough that I don't think it would be shown in school. Overall, I recommend it for teens to young adults. Enjoy!",1375142400,,507,4.644444444444445
8277203,5,B001AEF67C,Great job getting me this dvd! I love my new dvd soo much. I never get tired of watching it!,1361750400,,92,3.65
8277204,5,B001AEF67C,"I picked up the series as a random anime which I do constantly. I did not know what I got myself into.  I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and love triangles are the best way to go.  School Rumble is more of a love octagon which made it more funny.  All the characters are lovable and easy to like.  I had no problem jumping into the series, but it does it get better. Once you get to the second disc all hell breaks loose (i really don't watch the first disc all the much anymore).  The packaging comes in 3 slim packs.  2 of the slim packs have 2 discs in each pack and the final pack is all bonus features (interviews with the japanese voice actors).  The english dub is not bad, I really like the english voice actors for Makoto, Eri, and Tenma.
The story starts off really basic. Tenma likes Karusuma and Tenma is liked by the bad boy Harima, however.....  relationships start to get mixed up when Tenma's friend Eri starts messing with Harima along with Tenmas sister who is liked by Hanai, who belongs to dojo with Makoto (who is friends with Tenma) and...sorry I was rambling on. You see how this series is complicated.  The way the characters (especially Harima) get along with each other makes the ""rumble"" in school rumble.",1262044800,,1234,4.37719298245614
8277205,5,B001AEF67C,When I first saw the preview for School Rumble. I thought that it would be simply ridiculous and a waste of my time! Boy was I wrong! This has to be one of the funniest Animes I've ever had the pleasure of watching! Great voice acting! Great Storyline! I felt like I was reliving High School all over again!,1253750400,,307,4.220338983050848
8277206,5,B001AEF67C,"This is one of the most hilarious animes ever. There are moments that you just want to choke some of the characters who are almost willfully oblivious, but overall it is a fun relaxing anime. Great for vegging out.",1252972800,,214,4.512820512820513
8277207,5,B001AEF67C,"""School Rumble"" is probably my favorite modern comic from Japan.  Equal parts straight comedy, bizarre strangeness and hilarious romance hijinks, it manages to get the mix just right and have me cracking up in a way I haven't done since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Hina/dp/B001M6SHD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Hina</a>.

The basic premise is nothing unique.  Boy likes girl who likes different boy who likes other girl who likes different boy who likes an entirely different girl who is in love with the original boy who liked the original girl.  I remember when I first picked up the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/comic-book/dp/1435271106/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">comic book</a>&nbsp;in Japan, the display had a giant flowchart detailing all the romantic entanglements.

""School Rumble"" has a great ensemble cast without any throwaway characters.  Tsukamoto Tenma is the nave cute girl desperately in love with Karasuma Oji.  Why she loves Karasuma is a mystery, as he is a stone-faced oddball with no particular interests outside of curry, and who wears a kappa costume whenever it is raining.  Tenma is loved by the delinquent Harima Kenji, who tries to balance his wild nature with his feelings for Tenma. Tenma has a supporting cast of girlfriends, Eri (the rich princess), Mikoto (the brawny and busty kenpo athlete) and Akira (the cool calculator) who each have their romantic entanglements.

What is unique is how the series is handled.  The first few episodes are pretty straight forward, but then the whole storyline takes a quick turn to left field, almost as if the writer got bored with his original plan. I always tell people looking to check out ""School Rumble"" that they need to stick with it for a couple of episodes when the pace and quality really pick up.  Out of nowhere, Tenma's little sister comes in, with the ability to read the mind of any guy who finds her attractive, which is everyone but Harima Kenji.  Kenji suddenly becomes a long-haired fortune teller with the ability to talk to animals.  Ichijyo Karen makes an entrance, a small girl with tremendous strength who can lift a piano single-handedly. Slowly, the Harima/Tenma/Karasuma triangle heads backstage, and the crazy fun begins.

The animated series follows the comic almost exactly, with the same story arcs and situations.  They did a phenomenal job capturing the look and feel of the comic.  Tenma is even cuter here, and Harima is even cooler.  The way they handled Tsukamoto Yakuma's (Tenma's sister) ability to read minds was quite clever.  The animators obviously knew that the comic worked just as it was, and did a direct translation to screen.

This DVD collection by Funimation is equally fantastic.  It has the entire first season, 26 episodes, in four slim cases.  I love getting a whole season on DVD that doesn't take up a lot of space on my shelf.  I'm not a big fan of dubbing, so I can't comment on that, but the subtitles are excellent and do a great job of capturing the original dialog.  There is also a bonus disk with cast interviews that was a nice surprise.  Altogether a perfect package for a great series.",1238371200,,3226,5.255859375
8277208,5,B001AEF67C,"School Rumble is a ""Romantic Comedy"" about a group of girls and boys that go to, you guessed it, school.  I contend that it is more comedy than romance, as well as a good portion of ""slice of life"" in the mix.

The main love triangle of the series is between Tenma Tsukamoto's crush on Oji Karasuma while Kenji Harima loves Tenma.  While that may not sound too interesting, trust me when I say that they stretch and test the boundaries of this triangle more than any I have seen in media, but in a very entertaining way.

One other thing I can appreciate is that this series, unlike several different anime shows out there, never gets vulgar to the point where it gets a mature rating.  In fact, I'd say it's milder than most prime time shows, but twice as entertaining, and that is something I fully appreciate.

In short, please consider this worthy series to be with the rest of your DVD collections.  You do not need to know much of anything about anime or Japanese culture in order to understand the series, as myself and several others have discovered.",1234742400,4,1058,4.479166666666667
8277209,5,B001AEF67C,"So, I've watched the first 5 episodes of this anime so far and I must say, if you are looking for an anime where the heroine is a silly school girl who isn't too bright and has a major crush on the oblivious sweet guy while she herself has a suitor who's the bad boy in school but is just as silly and not too bright, then this is your anime.

Also, if you love Marmalade Boy, Kare Kano, or Mermaid Melody, you'll enjoy this too.

The fluff is perfectly mixed with the lovely artwork and silly plots. If you don't enjoy fluff and are looking for a more... intense school anime, you should check out an anime like Beck.",1230508800,,618,4.141666666666667
