This new title fills the gap a little bit, but not much. The main documentary doesn't offer much beyond old folks congratulating themselves on how they earned a living, and the rest is really little more than a hodgepodge of random promotional films.

I gave it four stars because, as a hardcore Disney fan, I just can't get enough of these old shows, and there is six hours of that stuff here. But overall, it's so sad. Disneyland played a key role in the definition of post-World War II America, and it deserves so much more attention that just some ""Weren't we great?"" reminiscing and dusted-off propaganda pieces. It's as if the Disney company doesn't have anyone in it who really cares about its history -- at least anyone in the DVD division.",1197417600,5,1762,7.11520737327189
2939493,5,B000VE4UCE,"Many have waited for this DVD to be released, and should be glad that Disney took the time to upgrade what was to originally be a 1 disc DVD. As part of the Walt Disney Treasures Series, this tin comes with a beautiful reproduction of a Disneyland Ticket Book (with ALL the tickets, A through; not a single one missing!), a small postcard size print of Herb Ryman's 1954 concept illustration of the castle (which really should have been scanned at a higher resolution; it's a somewhat poor reproduction), a numbered certificate of authenticity, as well as a small booklet describing the current WDT series and the contents of this set. To me, the ""wow"" factor comes with the 1956 Disneyland USA Cinemascope feature and the time-lapse color construction footage of the park. The Cinemascope movie is in glowing color and includes a nice 5.1 surround mix; or, for extra info, you can listen to interesting behind-the-scenes commentary by Tony Baxter and Leonard Maltin. The overviews of the park from helicopter are views that could never be recreated again; the park is in its infancy, and this movie gives you amazing shots of Disneyland from top to bottom. It is almost like being in the park. I can't say enough good things about this particular segment. The construction footage is another rarity; apparently about 200+ hours of this stuff exists; some of the best is right here on the disc, viewable/separated by land. There are multiple angles, so very little of the park is missed. To see how quickly the park was built will astound you; watching the Moonliner be installed right up to opening day is jaw dropping. Last minute decisions like moving the bandstand from Town Square to near the castle are all documented here; you'll also find Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen on hand in their Davy Crockett costumes, surveying the installation of the Frontierland Gates, all in amazing color. On the same disc, you will also find the obligatory game; I usually skip these, however, once you answer the easy or advanced question sequence on trivia from Disneyland, you are treated to bonus footage. This bonus footage is selectable from a ticket book: pick A through E ticket, and then select the desired attraction to see this behind the scenes clip. Unfortunately, only one selection per game; if you want to see more, you need to play again. Bummer...

Disc 1 also  has the Disneyland: Secrets, Stories and Magic documentary, with opening/closing segments by Julie Andrews. This documentary is a whirlwind tour of the park's history and philosophies, with interviews from the key players: John Hench, Rolly Crump, Tony Baxter, Marc Davis, Ron Dominguez, Diane Disney, and many more. Sadly, it does leave you wanting much more as it is impossible to cover everything. Still, what it shows is excellent and you get a true sense of how important Walt himself was. As Crump states, you didn't work for a corporation when you worked at the Studio or at the park; you worked for Walt himself. His death was deeply felt by all those who worked for him.

Disc 2 contains the time lapse footage and a gallery of stills featuring concept art and more. ""Operation Disneyland"" describes how Disney and ABC covered the opening day of the park. Very rare footage (black and white) that was never really meant for the general public to see. ""The Golden Horseshoe Revue"" 1962 broadcast is somewhat ""staged"" (no pun intended), but the entertainment is first class. Not only do you get the classic team of Wally Boag and Betty Taylor, throw in Ed Wynn and Annette Funicello for good measure. The quality of the color and picture are excellent, making you feel like you have a seat in the front row (according to the premise of the show, you are sitting in a front table reserved for Walt's special guests). The ""World's Fair"" broadcast is from 1964 and shows the amazing things created by Disney: Small World, Tower of the Four Winds (by Rolly Crump), Mr. Lincoln, as well as the Cavemen/Dinosaurs that were eventually added to Disneyland in the Diorama (mercifully, the hokey Cavemen didn't make the transition). You can feel  how proud Walt is of all these accomplishments, and see Crump blowing on the model of the tower trying to get it to spin. ""Disneyland Around the Seasons"" is also interesting; the installation of Small World and New Orleans Square, as well as a parade (Julie Andrews need not be jealous of the Mary Poppins in this one!) and the annual tradition of the Candlelight Processional down Main Street.

What an incredible treat; hopefully a positive reaction to this set will encourage Disney to release more of these true treasures from the vaults. This is an excellent set that I highly recommend.",1197417600,10,4703,4.830024813895782
2939494,3,B000VE4UCE,"For 3 years we've been waiting for this DVD, and the main feature is a HUGE disappointment.  Footage is drawn from a variety of resources including quite a bit from commercials and free vacation planning videos.  I was expecting this to be THE definitive Disneyland documentary.  Unfortunately the amazing cast of interviewees are only afforded sound bytes for the casual Disney fan.  Nothing really new or amazing is reveal here.

That said...this DVD set is a must for the archival shows, not the least of which is Disneyland, USA.  It is a spectacular artifact from the early days of Disneyland...before the Matterhorn, before the monorail, before the Pirates of the Caribbean, before the Haunted Mansion.  This is the Disneyland with pack mules and model airplanes.  This is the Disneyland which Walt personally oversaw.  The film's presented letterboxed in beautiful color.  Definitely a must for serious Disney fans.  The remaining episodes of The Wonderful World of Color are fun to have and watch, but less all encompassing that the Disneyland USA feature.  The ABC documentary is interesting but perhaps not for repeat viewings.

Like so much that comes out of Disney...the new seems to be only a rehash of warmed leftovers...but the vintage stuff...is golden.",1197331200,5,1269,5.161764705882353

Disc #1

DISNEYLAND SECRETS, STORIES AND MAGIC (2005 documentary updated for 2007, produced for the 50th anniversary of the park.) Well, no real secrets here.  This is basically a 'talking heads' documentary intercut with behind-the-scenes clips that Walt had shot for his Wonderful World of Color show.  While it is nice to see Walt again explaining how things work, these segments are clearly staged. The new interviews with those who had worked on the park back then add some first hand insight about their perception of what happened.  You will still feel their emotions as they relate the shockwave that hit when Walt died.
It is at this point, 50 minutes in, that the documentary starts to die.  The focus seems to be lost and the interviews disjointed.  One gets the impression from this documentary that the Disney company lost all creativity after Walt's death.  Disneyland turns to the creative force of George Lucas for Star Tours and Indiana Jones.  The direction of this documentary goes chaotic in the last 15 minutes & I had trouble keeping interest in what was being said, as some of it repeated the first half and the rest was just promotional fluff.
We get teased about the Disneyland that never happened, with a few examples of attractions that never got past the planning stages. This should have been expanded to replace the last 15 minutes.  This could have been some of the secrets promised by the title.
This documentary could have easily been the full two discs of this set, many early segments in the first half seem too short.  There are many more stories we would like to hear.  Some of them are related in other Disneyland DVDs.
(I almost reduced the star rating to **** because of the weak ending, but I decided the DVD set as a whole is worth ***** )

PEOPLE AND PLACES: DISNEYLAND U.S.A. (Widescreen theatrical short from the mid 1950's).  A Technicolor Techniscope look at some of the Disneyland attractions in the mid 1950's.

Disc #2

OPERATION DISNEYLAND (14 minute film for ABC-TV discussing the difficulties involved with broadcasting from the park).  You get to see all of the behind-the scenes activities that brought the live broadcast to air.  Even I didn't know that they had to borrow coaxial cable from as far away as San Francisco, and all three major networks supplied video cameras (as well as local television stations).  This was the mid 1950's and television equipment was not as abundant as it is today.  This B&W film is a real treasure!

THE GOLDEN HORSE REVUE (Disney's Wonderful World of Color 9/23/62)features Annette, Ed Wynn & other Disney stars performing on the Disneyland stage.

DISNEYLAND GOES TO THE WORLD'S FAIR (Disney's Wonderful World of Color 5/17/64)

DISNEYLAND AROUND THE SEASONS (Disney's Wonderful World of Color 12/18/66). This TV episode was filmed just before Walt's death but aired after he had died.  It must have been a little morbid to see this on it's first airing as all viewers knew he was gone.

BUILDING WALT'S DREAM: Disneyland Under Construction.  This is a 35 minute time-lapsed filming of the building of Disneyland.  Walt had set up permanent cameras to record this historic event on color film.  The studio did not know what this film was, it was just marked ""Walt's Film"".  When they viewed it they realized they had found a treasure.  Disneyland Imaginers & historians give details about what is going on to further your enjoyment of this film record.

Still frame galleries.

All of the films presented here are gloriously restored and look like they were shot yesterday.",1197331200,19,3644,4.836833602584814

2939547,5,B000VE4UCE,"Wave 7 begins with a fantastic title(..or at least it starts out that way), this one featuring more Disneyland footage and TV shows. This is the third Treasures set devoted to Disneyland and this release is the best of the trio. The more I watch these old Disney programs the more I realize how much we lost when Walt Disney died! He had such vision, energy and with his super salesmen's personality(I mean that in a good way!), he was able to get things done that may have never seen the light of day. It is so sad that he died from lung cancer at age 65. He is one of the great loses of the 20th century.

The first disc starts out with a really good 81 minute documentary on the Disneyland park and while it has hints of an infomercial, it is extremely enjoyable to watch. Being from the east coast, I have never been to Disneyland, but my parents took us to Disney World a couple of years after it opened. We stayed in the Contemporary Tower and even though the hotel was more expensive than staying outside the park, my parents couldn't resist the fact the the monorail would take us to and from the park and leave us in the lobby of the hotel. This meant they didn't have to go with us or stay as long as we wanted to stay in the park....and of course my brother and I could get into all kinds of mischief. ;-D .....OK back to the DVD set.

The second feature on disc one is People and Places Disneyland U.S.A. which is are real treasure as it is a 42 minute view of the park in 1959. It's filmed in Cinemascope and it looks fantastic for it's age. The helicopter view is wonderful and you get a real sense of how special a place this was when it first opened(it still is!). Listed as a feature on disc one is a trivia game which is fun at first, but you soon realize that there is only one set of questions. To make matters worse, you play to see little snippets of film that take you through a Disneyland ride you chose. You only get to chose one and if you want to see it again you have to play the redundant game over and over again! UGGHHHH! It was a nice idea but, it grows tiresome quick. The first disc doesn't hold the quantity it should, but what is here is really good stuff!

The second disc is somewhat disappointing as it has three episodes from the Wonderful World Of Color which are cool to watch separately, but watching the last two shows after the two specials on disc one, it becomes apparent that there is a lot of overlapping footage. The one show that is different The Golden Horseshoe Revue is a song and dance show that is very boring(at least to me?). The same goes for Operation Disney, which is a neat curiosity to see, but it is as tedious to watch as it must have been for the TV crew trying to put the opening of Disneyland on TV. The extras on disc two are a gallery and another bright spot, the inclusion of a time-lapse film of the building of Disneyland(another brainstorm of Walt's). Walt had the forethought to construct large scaffolds to film the park being built....as if there wasn't enough to do to get the park open on time.

While this set is a bit of a mixed bag, it has some of the best stuff released on any treasures set and it is certainly worthy of a purchase if you can find it at a reasonable price! I would love to see more releases devoted to Disneyland and Disney World for that matter. I'm sure there is footage in the archives of it.....sure looks like plenty of material to release another ""Treasures"" wave to me.;-)",1378339200,2,3480,4.23644578313253

I'm surprised other reviewers haven't mentioned this problem yet, and therefore I question if I am missing something that others have picked up on.

My favorite part of the two-disc set is the documentary, ""People and Places: Disneyland, U.S.A."".  Made in 1956, one year after Disneyland opened, the documentary provides a nearly complete video tour of the park.  It's funny to see people visiting Disneyland in their Sunday best - ladies in dresses, men wearing fancy hats, etc.
  There is much more to the dvd than the old 1956 documentary, but I thought it was interesting and wanted to point it out.  Also, a replica of a vintage coupon book is included with the dvd's along with a certificate of authenticity - the coupon book is neat.

There are some lands and attractions that you hear from older Disneyland 'enthusiats' that are documented and well talked in there.

The one documentary that I found was quite amazing is People and Places: Disneyland USA. It is quite fantastic and so well restored; it look like it was filmed 25 years ago, not in 1955

The one thing that is quite apparent throughout the documentary is the almost palpable absence of Mickey Mouse in the first years of the park. He is at the entrance (with the famous flower face) and there is a little Mouseketeers area, but that's pretty much it.

This collection is limited to only 50 000 (just like all the other Walt Disney Treasures). Make sure you grab it now if you want it; it is a 2007 release and once it's gone, it's gone! There is no known instance of Walt Disney Treasures that are re-edited.

My father, Frank, was Grumpy in the Ice Capades show and in that costume in the parade. It is only a short glimpse, but I can see he was having fun. What a wonderful image of my father.

Walt Disney makes several appearances. It includes a show of the fabulous Golden Horseshoe Review with Annette Funichelo and even an interactive trivia game about Disneyland and includes a replica book of the old A, B, C, D, and E tickets from the old days.

The 2nd disc is a bit weak with selections from 3 TV shows; I could have used more interviews with previous imagineers as well as artists then and now that have influenced (and been influenced by) this wonderful place and the man who made it all happen.",1206316800,2,540,4.4646464646464645
2939600,5,B000VE4UCE,"Another wonderful collection of clips and shows from the old Disney vaults. It is impressive to see how well they have restored the original footage showing Walt Disney talking about the Disneyland Park. It clearly shows how entertaining and informative the Disney Company was then. Simply put, ahead of its time. The contributions that Disney made to the 1964 World's Fair are also reminders of when our minds would be captivated by being in such fantastical places. Is a far cry from today's video games and computer ""canned"" entertainment. I personally think that a big part of Disneyland's success has to do with having the audience ""experience"" the rides instead of just looking at them in two dimensions such as is the case with video games. Rides like ""It's A Small World"" still have relevance today showing enthusiastic hope for a more united world. In the DVD, we get to see the ride come to life as Walt himself explains the planning and construction of it. Also, another very interesting video is the time-lapse footage of the construction of the park itself. Very visionary of Walt to place cameras during construction to capture it all  as it went along.
Interestingly enough, one can detect that most of the shows are basically ""selling"" the Disneyland theme park to the audience and that may throw some people off. However, all one has to do is go to the park itself to find out that what he was selling was beyond your expectations. The park that started as an icon of wholesomeness Americana, has now become so  around the world, spanning four more Magic Kingdoms so far. Disneyland is a testament of all that is good from America unlike our portrayal in the international news these days. In other words, if Walt Disney was just indeed selling his park, then I'm sold as you should be too!",1206316800,3,1807,4.751592356687898

After watching these wonderful DVD's I found out that there was still much to discover about him and his mission. I visited the Disney World at least 20 times, thanks to my numerous visits to the USA. As a professor at the University of Music in Vienna I've met many artists all over the world and worked with them. Based on these experiences I can proudly say that Walt Disney was the greatest artist of the 20th century. He united the children (and the adults who remained children) of our world by his art, imagination and creativity. I was born in Turkey and grew up with the weekly Disney magazine called ""Miki"" (Turkish version of Mickey). When I first went to the USA everything was so familiar to me. From the school buses (which Huey, Dewey and Louie were riding) to the Everglades swamps (where Mickey and Goofy were intimidated by the alligators). What a wonderful way of advertisement of one's home country.
I sincerely do recommend this DVD-set to all Disney-lovers. They will have wonderful ""many"" 6 hours in front of their TV.",1204675200,4,1190,4.671428571428572

This is a must-have for the die-hard Disney fan or historian but may not be exciting enough for a general Disney enthusiast.  I especially loved the aerial footage over the park while it was being built and during its time of operation.  Coverage of Disneyland over the rest of the 50 years is very fulfilling, but it does skip over some of the years.

Plus Golden Horshoe Revue, World's fair 1964 and Disneyland through the seasons.
And if that isn't enough - a film about the building of DL and a still frames gallery. These two disks really are a true Disney treasure and I would recommend them for any Disney fan.
And finally -  a reproduction (not actual size) of a 1955 ticket book and a postcard featuring conceptual art of the castle.

2939648,4,B000VE4UCE,"The highlight of the two-disc Walt Disney Treasures set is certainly the retrospective with past and present Disney icons ranging from Rolly Crump to Tony Baxter. Most notably are the Disneyland operations managers dating back to the opening of Disneyland with stories that haven't been sanitized in the documentary, rather honest tales of success and failures. It's rather well produced and shows several interesting items not seen before. You'll be impressed with the superb quality film that Walt Disney used to film everything from the pre-opening construction of the park to the television programs. They hold up quite well in quality. My personal favorite was the filming of Disneyland during the opening year in full color vs. what we've usually just seen, grainy footage from the ABC opening program.

Disney clearly had audio and visual in mind, as the programs look excellent on an upconvert 1080i HDMI DVD player on a HDTV. The discs have several Disneyland television programs on it including the enjoyable World's Fair of 1964/65 television program.

It's a very enjoyable set, but it would be even better with further interviews with the legends that created Disneyland.",1200441600,3,1184,5.226315789473684

Tying the Disney Studio movies into the park themes, Leonard Maltin and Julie Andrews bookmark this visually satisfying account.  It had such a gripping and sentimental narrative, I didn't want it to end.  It brought back such great memories for me.  Luckily the Disney Story is far from over.  I want to go back!

So is their mention of stars such as Sammy Davis, Jr. making an appearance.  There was nothing on either of these discs that featured Steve Martin or any big stars' appearances, unless you count Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen wandering through the park as special.

2939677,5,B000VE4UCE,"I just finished watching this amazing DVD and was anxious to get on here and was expecting to read some rave reviews on this new installment to the Disney Treasures Series.  To my surprise this volume so far has the lowest feedback rating....and it shocked me!  As I read thru the reviews I was truely disheartened as to how this volume has been criticized by some.  Since many others have done a great job filling you in on all the material that is on this DVD I will just cut to the chase and address some of the negative points that are mentioned in some of the other reviews as well as share my own feelings on the DVD set in general.

  First of all ths Disneyland Secrets Stories and Magic documentary is well done.  I honestly enjoyed it and it was a real treat to watch and listen to the first hand accounts from some of the very people who helped to make Disneyland a reality!  With all the rare footage it really brought the Disneyland story to life!  This documentary is certainly not ""crap"" as one reviewer stated.  I think this person along with some of the others who rated this feature negatively has to remember that all of us aren't as knowlegable on Disny/ Disneyland and its history as many die hard Disney buffs and scholars may be.  This documentary was produced for what was supposed to be a DVD release intended for the general PUBLIC (not necessarily die hard Disney buffs) there for when you look at it in its proper perspective, this feature accomplishes all it was meant to.  Im sorry if some of you didn't gain any new information from this feature and you were left disappointed, but you should at least be able to find great value in the time capsule it is.

  People and Places Disneyland is a great addition to this DVD set!  Most reviewers were very favorable in their reviews of this installment so I won't spend much time defending it.  It is truely one of the highlights of this volume and is an awsome film to see and experience with the commontaries!

  Disc 2 in contrast to some reviews is GREAT!  The first feature OPERATION DISNEYLAND is very interesting for its historic value.  It was never intended to be entertaining but it is neat to see this alternate perspective of the opening day of disneyland.

  The Golden Horseshoe Revue is awsome! The original cast of the show is joined by some great guest stars.....the best and most entertaining being Ed Wynn and the lovely, beautiful and talented Annette Funicello.  Betty Taylor is a real treat to see here and her voice blew me away.  Walts introductions to the episode are as charming as always.  This is one not to miss.

  Disneyland Goes to the Worlds Fair and Disneyland Around the Seasons are both awsome Disneyland episodes to see come to DVD! They both contain some great footage of the now classic attractions that are enjoyed at Disneyland/ Disney World or both parks.  These two episodes along with The Golden Horseshoe are all 5 star shows and cant be missed!

Building Walts Dream is in the bonus feature section of this disc.  As other reviewers have noted this is REALLY intersting!  I cant believe they build that park in a year and how much they had to do yet when it was just months away from opening its gates!!!!  Dont miss this

  I honestly have no complaints about this DVD set!  Its a well put together DVD set that is deserving of being added to your DVD libraries.  One further note to this volumes ""haters"" out there......Have you ever heard the saying ""Dont bite the hand that feeds you.""???  WELL here is where I will come in defending Leonard Maltin.  Leonard Maltin steps in the very shoes of Walt Disney as host of the DVDs in this series.  He  does a fantastic job and I personally find his insight and introductions very appropriate and interesting!  He carries on the tradition of Walt himself and as a fan himself, he knows what questions we want answered in the interviews he does for these volumes.  Im quite sure if it wasn't for Leonard we wouldnt even have these DVDs to enjoy and many of these film elements would still be sitting in the vaults for eternity!  SO think about that before you go turning your nose up at these DVD sets.  When the series is canceled (which I hope is a long ways away) im sure you will be the first to complain and never realize that your being so hard to please was the result of their extinction.  Think about it and in the mean time ENJOY THESE DVDS....THEY ARE A TREASURE AFTER ALL!!",1199232000,7,4454,4.485678704856787
2939678,5,B000VE4UCE,"When the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" sets started in 2001 the very first one I purchased was the Disneyland set.
I love it & still watch it now.

Why did it take Disney 6 years to put together another set/package for Disneyland is beyond me.
WAY TOO LONG to wait Disney.

I love this set.

Some of the episodes I have on video tape already.  It is so nice to have all of them with perfect picture.  Having the ""Disneyland  ""U..S.A."" show in wide screen is great & the commentary with Leonard and Tony is fantastic.

Let me say this to Disney-PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANOTHER 6 YEARS TO GET ANOTHER DISNEYLAND SET/PACKAGE TOGETHER.

And, my requests for the next set/package.  1959 for the opening of the Matterhorn, Monorail & submarines, 1967 for the opening of Pirates & the new Tomorrow land & 1969's ""Disneyland Showtime"" for the opening of the Haunted Mansion with Kurt Russell & the Osmond Brothers.",1199145600,18,895,4.578616352201258
2939679,5,B000VE4UCE,"I am quite a fan of the Walt Disney Treasures Collection, but this edition devoted to Disneyland is WONDERFUL!  I love Disneyland, and have spent quite a bit of time there, but I still discovered new information from this.

While watching the documentary, I just felt, ""This feels like home.""  I know it sounds silly, but that's how I felt.  It wasn't nearly in-depth enough for me, but I think it definitely captured the spirit of Disneyland.

The other vintage material on the set is also great fun to watch, and I am so glad that I chose to add it to my collection.  There is also a trivia game, and I found that quite fun as well.  The reproduction of the E Ticket is also great!

I highly reccomend that you buy this set today if you are even slightly considering it as it is only limited to 50.000 copies.  I searched several stores in two states, and I finally found 1 copy.  Save yourself some time and heartache, and buy this Walt Disney Treasures TODAY!",1198972800,4,963,4.389830508474576
2939680,4,B000VE4UCE,"I generally enjoy Disney's ""Treasures"" releases, due to their wealth of insiders knowledge and vintage film and shows that appear in these special collector's packages. I do own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walt-Disney-Treasures-Disneyland-USA/dp/B00005KARE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walt Disney Treasures - Disneyland USA</a>, and watch it from time to time, fascinated by the many selections offered. I was so happy to learn that Disney was releasing a new set of videos, ""Disneyland- Secrets, Stories and Magic"".

This two-disc set offers a small variety of shorts, clips, and films that were used to promote Disneyland in it's earliest stages. The first disk contains a recent documentary on the creation and development of Disneyland, with many, many interviews by Disneyland insiders still living, which provides a fascinating look at how Walt built the park. This doc tends to concentrate on the early years, instead of a broader fifty year view of the park.

The treasure on this disk, however, can be found in the ""People and Places"" documentary filmed in a new technology at the time, ""Cinemascope"". Filmed in all four lands, this film shows Disneyland in it's true infancy, with stage coach rides, the trip to the moon, and a park without New Orleans Square. Despite it's occasional  un-PC tone (you audibly groan as the narrator talks about Native Americans), it's a fascinating look inside the park early on. I watched it once, then immediately watched it with the insightful commentary track by Leonard Maltin and Tony Baxter. Wheeeee!

Disc two is a bit more disappointing. There is an unexplicable boring ""Operation Disneyland"" made for TV stations showing the technological nightmare of bringing the live opening day Disneyland broadcast to the public. I stopped it three minutes in for fear I'd fall asleep. Fortunately, ""Disneyland through the Seasons"" makes up for this faux pas. I loved watching it, despite the hint of sadness, realizing Walt had died just prior to its broadcast.

I gave this set, which in my opinion is sold VERY cheaply, four stars, only because I want more. As a true Disney fan, who loved Disneyland ever since he was six years old, it's hard to satisfy my hunger for Disney information. This is a great, great appetizer, though!",1198627200,51,2320,5.362637362637362
2939681,5,B000VE4UCE,"I grew up in Orange County in the 1960's and 70's and have so many great and affectionate memories of Disneyland (especially with my Dad who passed away 3 years ago) that I can't find any faults with this DVD. It's
the first comprehensive look at the ORIGINAL Disneyland and that should be
enough. I'm very well educated on the story of Walt and Roy and the evolution of the park, though I wouldn't call myself an expert. But, I can
honestly say I lived it as it was and still is the greatest place in the world to be, in my opinion. No one can take my memories away.
 So, for those of you who complain that it should have been more extensive
- GET OVER IT ! I think it's a wonderful collection and I was thrilled by
the footage I was seeing for the first time. If you truly love Disneyland
you will love this. For those who want more, go make your own DVD and leave the rest of us alone. It's one of the best ""Treasure"" DVD's. Period.",1198281600,4,935,4.109289617486339
2939682,4,B000VE4UCE,"If you love Disneyland, you are going to buy this DVD set anyway.
You won't be dissapointed
-- with the real treasures -- but the supposed ""main attraction"", a documentary which is the DVD's name sake, is just O.K.
It is put together just like a segment on the travel channel...fast cuts & sound bite interviews from which you get a general feeling that whoever put this documentary together is trying to whip up excitement instead of truly honor the rides and the park and those involved in creating it.  The park, rides & creators can stand for themselves.  Still, it's interesting.

The GREAT PARTS OF THE DOCUMENTARY, are the ""not enough"" segments of designers who were there creating with Walt, like Rolly Crump, Herb Ryman and about a 2 second clip of John Hench.

The things that could be done away with in the documentary, are how many times those involved with Disney today saying Walt always said the park would change and grow and then give examples like taking the characters out of the America Sings ride and put them into the Splash Mountain ride...as an example of something new. There was no footage or mentioning of the America Sings ride besides that! Adding Johnny Depp into the Pirates of the Carribean ride is fine, but please don't tell me the rides are becoming new and exciting by reusing a lot of recognizable figures from another ride or turning a tree house designed for Swiss Family Robinson into a Tarzan tree house.  Ofcourse, this is merely an opinion - back to the review, eh?

GREAT THINGS come in the mostly fast motion - although some of it is real time - footage of Disneyland being built.
Watching the buildings and boats being constructed is wild and fascinating. But also, there is a bit if footage of Walt and some folks riding on the Jungle Cruise way before it is finished, people standing on the back of the boat - informal!
There is enjoyable short footage of Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen dressed up in their Davy Crocket outfits joining in to help build Frontierland.  I'm not sure Fess ever chopped wood before.

HAPPILY, there are plenty of old Disney ""Wonderful World of Color"" episodes that include looks into the making of the park and rides.
I'm not a big fan of parades but THE LOOKS AT THE PARADES ARE FANTASTIC.  You can see how they really did little plays within the parade where the parade would stop and the characters completely interact and engage the onlookers.  For example - Goofy's car breaking down and him trying to get it restarted.
Also, Tommorowland is featured and how fun to SEE AN ASTRONAUT FLY around, propelling himself above the castle and hopefully land safely.
Again, why they have to play some footage in front of these episodes to entice you to watch it is beyound me.

The commentary on the set is not automatically optional, although you can always turn the sound down or try and skip through it.  Some folks don't need to be ""set up"" for something or have it explained before they watch it.
HEAVILY FEATURED IN THIS SET are: IT'S A SMALL WORLD, the DINOSAUR ride, the JUNGLE CRUISE & GREAT MOMENTS WITH MR. LINCOLN.

BEAUTIFUL FOOTAGE in the WORLD's FAIR episode!  The strolling Disney characters and the movement of the Fantasia Hippos by the colorful water fountains is FUNtastic, a sight to behold (...that may sound corny but it's true.) A really nice and detailed episode.

There could of been plenty more on here.  Even the DVDs for the ""Pirates of the Carribean"" film & for ""The Love Bug"", have footage of the Pirates ride opening at Disneyland and Herbie day at Disneyland, respectively.

If it sounds good, just take the absolutely terrific with the just O.K. and buy this set...you'll love & enjoy it...& - as the title suggests- even treasure it.",1198281600,3,3738,4.656534954407295
2939683,2,B000VE4UCE,"the first documentary which is the feature, i might add, is crap.  there is nothing new or amazing, or any secrets for that matter, nothing, skip[ past this feature. sad, sad.
the game on disc one is even dumber.  when will realize that grown ups and most kids don't play dvd games, they play real video games, and the reward is a 15 second clip of nothing, and after you unlock it, it doesnt stay unlocked! play the whole thing for no reward, no thanks.
the third feature on the first disc is the only real reason to purchase this dvd, it is beautiful, in color, and a portrait of 1955 (1956) disneyland.  this is a gem!!!!!!

the second disc, had some good things on it.
the opening day doc was fun, and time lapse was amazing, but two of the features looked like CRAP on my player.  i have disney asddressing this.  anyone else have the problem on disc 2?",1198022400,2,858,4.298136645962733
2939684,5,B000VE4UCE,"One piece of footage on this DVD is so funny I was in tears laughing at it. I had once read that when Disneyland was under construction, that Walt would be driving around and if he caught your eye, he would speed up and make a crazy face and then start laughing. To my surprise he was caught on film doing just this!!! What fun it was to see this!

There is so much that makes this a fantastic collection; from the footage mentioned above, to the footage of Annette, Wally Boag, and Ed Wynn together at The Golden Horse Shoe.

And for those who have the previously released opening day telecast, there's something for you too. How about a behind the scenes film released strictly to ABC via closed circuit TV and never seen publicly describing in detail how that broadcast was done. Doing live broadcasts today is ""old hat"" but in those days this was brand new. Don't forget that none of those TV cameras had wireless ability. There really was in fact, miles of cable running throughout the park and here we get to see those cables!

This package includes a Disneyland trivia game that is a lot of fun. When you complete a section of the game it rewards you with choices of extra footage, including the interior of the Disney family apartment above the firehouse on Main Street USA.

There is also footage of interviews with various Imagineers including Tony Baxter, the late Marc Davis and the recently late Bruce Gordon.
Mr. Gordon recently died at a very young age. He was the author of two Disney related books and had an unauthorized online fan club dedicated to him. He was much beloved by the surviving Disney family members and they created a page dedicated to his memory that can be found on the Walt Disney family museum web site.

My conclusion: Get this DVD!",1197763200,6,1770,4.51875
2939685,3,B000VE4UCE,"Where is Steve Martin and the other performers mentioned in the product description?  I have all but one of the DVD Treasures and each successive wave seems more rushed and more slapped together.  While it is great, the vintage footage screams ""it could be so much more, but we just didn't feel like spending the time on this series this time.""  This and all the others would be better if the same care and content that went into the first releases went into this and successive waves.  The video here is absolutely priceless, but could be put together and polished more.  The charming Leonard Maltin seems tired and distracted in the introduction.  The video recollections are  nice, and thankfully these legendary comments are archived, but the DVD as a ""treasure"" could be packaged much better with more video and more care.  The one bright spot is the Diamond Horseshoe and other vintage shots, as well as the individual recollections on disc one.",1197676800,2,951,4.827160493827161
2939686,5,B000VE4UCE,"This review was going to be strictly for the Annette Funicello fans out there until I previewed one of the episodes. I only bought this DVD because it contained a show entitled THE GOLDEN HORSESHOE REVUE which aired on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color some 45 years ago. The Revue is a staple at Disneyland. Here, it was presented for TV with a few Guest Stars, one of whom was Annette. I am a Annette ""completist"". I hadn't seen this since it was first aired. I had been working late and so I thought I'd just take a look at Annette's song ""Mr. Piano Man"" and watch the entire DVD some other time. I ended up watching the entire episode. This show never looked so good. Remember the kaliedoscope opening with a chorus singing; ""Color... color!""? I was hooked from the start. Some quick math indicates that Annette was about 18 years old here. She's even prettier than I remembered and, not only does she sing ""Mr. Piano Man"", she sings something called ""The Buffalo Round-Up"" which I didn't even remember at all! I also loved Betty Taylor as Slue-foot Sue, a pretty Patti Page type with a nice strong vocal delivery. I had forgotten how entertaining Wally Boag could be with just a few props, a rubbery face and a contortionists' body. His style reminded me of a slightly less handsome version of Dick Van Dyke. Ed Wynn and Gene Sheldon are here along with a staged saloon fight that has become a staple of theme parks throughout the country but never done better than on this show with musical accompaniment. I had forgotten how good wholesome family entertainment could be! This really took me back. Now, I can't wait to see all the rest of the features on this set. Five stars!",1197590400,16,1687,4.534426229508196

8218439,4,B000VE4UCE,"Sadly, it appears that Disney has decided not to continue with the Disney Treasures DVD sets.  Over the years, these two disc collections have included some fun and rare stuff that Disnerds like me have lapped up.  (Okay, so I've probably only watched about half of what I have, but I still want more.)  Disneyland - Secrets, Stories & Magic was released a couple of years ago, and I just now got around to watching it.  I felt like it didn't quite live up to the Secrets part of the title, but there are Stories and Magic aplenty.

The heart of the first disc is a new 80 minute long documentary about the creation of the park.  It starts with the idea Walt originally had and covers the construction and opening of the park.  Most of the time is spent on Walt's years, and the time after he died is covered only briefly.  Over the course of the documentary, you get vintage and new interviews from Walt Disney, George Lucas, and various people who were instrumental in the park over the years.  While I enjoyed it and lapped up all the information again, I didn't really feel like there was anything new here.  Disnerd that I am, I knew just about every story retold already.  Not that I don't enjoy hearing them again, but I wanted something new.

And that's where the rest of the disc comes through in shining colors.  The first disc also includes ""People and Places: Disneyland USA.""  This 42 minute documentary filmed in the daring, new technology of cinemascope, was made in 1956 and takes us to all four of the lands of Disneyland.  It really is a time capsule, and I found looking at the park I know and love as it was when it first opened fascinating.  There's also an audio commentary on this special with Disney and film historian Leonard Maltin and Imagineer Tony Baxter.

Before we leave disc one, I should mention the trivia challenge.  I picked hard figuring I knew it all.  This wasn't as easy as it looked.  When you finally answer enough questions, you get a video ride through of some of the popular rides in the park.

The second disc in the set contains some truly fun gems.  Up first is a 14 minute presentation never meant to air outside of ABC stations.  ""Operation Disneyland"" was filled to show them the work that went on to bring the live opening day broadcast to the stations.  Live TV sure was complicated back then.  Okay, so it's not worth watching more than once, but I enjoyed seeing it.

The heart of this disc are three episodes of The Wonderful World of Color TV show from the 1960's.  Up first is ""The Golden Horseshoe Revue,"" a celebration of the 10,000th performance in the theater in Frontierland.  In addition to the regular cast of Betty Taylor and Wally Boag, we get appearances by guest stars Ed Wynn and Mouseketeer Annette Funicello.  This show is funny.  If the Golden Horseshoe still had something of this caliber, I'd make a point of going when I visit the park.

Next comes ""Disneyland Goes to the World's Fair.""  For the 1964-1965 World's Fair, Disney contributed several attractions, all of which moved to the park when the fair ended.  We get a behind the scenes look at the growing field of audio animatronics as we see how they created such classics as it's a small world, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, and The Carousel of Progress.  There's not much new here, but I had a blast watching it anyway, especially since the last 15 minutes is a video trip through it's a small world.  (Yes, I can hear you screaming from here.)

Finally, we get ""Disneyland Around the Seasons,"" a celebration of the 11th year of the park.  And what a busy year it was as the previous mentioned attractions opened.  That means we get some of the same behinds the scenes info on them, and a similar tour of small world.  We also get to see Mr. Lincoln's speech, and it's just as moving on video and it is in person.  This was also the year that New Orleans Square opened.  Finally, the special concludes with the Christmas parade from 1966.  Sadly, the joy of this special is tainted just Disney died just three days before it originally aired.

But we aren't quite done yet.  Somewhere in the archives, they discovered time lapse photography of the construction of the park, and they've included it here with commentary by Tony Baxter and two other Disney employees.  No, this isn't riveting TV, but it is fascination to watch the almost 40 minutes and hear their thoughts on how quickly the entire park came together.

If this had managed to unearth some new, surprising stories, I would have given Disneyland - Secrets, Stories & Magic a full five stars.  As it is, you've probably heard most of this no matter how big a Disney fan you are.  But the productions from the 50's and 60's are loads of fun and worth tracking this set down.",1431561600,,4773,4.521028037383178

It's a short piece of the history of Disneyland and then it's a bunch of crap and I didn't even sit through to watch. Disapointing. To me, not worth the money. Even if it was $5. Of course, it is a collectable and there was only a few (ha) made, so if you are into collecting crap, here you go!",1404086400,,415,3.9523809523809526
