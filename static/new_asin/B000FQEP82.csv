8125655,5,B000FQEP82,I'm quite a collector of interracial relationship movies and even though this movie is low budget it was still unique in it's approach. I though it had some really funny parts throughout.  One thing that stood out is that this movie dealt with their interracial relationship at a domestic level as well.,1412985600,3,303,4.826923076923077
8125656,3,B000FQEP82,OK movie. Plot was OK. Very low budget. Young inexperienced actors. They did their best. Could have had a little more depth.,1391904000,,124,4.681818181818182

8125658,3,B000FQEP82,"Interracial tale of love and it's trouble seeing past color lines. I really love the total honest, but it distacted from the lead characters lives. I have heard that the lead actress is in an interracial relationship, and this is based on her life. That is kinda cool.

Plot was Hokey, and sometimes it dragged but it was good.",1185753600,7,327,4.5423728813559325
8125659,4,B000FQEP82,I saw this movie earlier this year & I thought it was great. Its an independent movie LOOSELY BASED on the lead actress's life.,1181520000,4,127,4.333333333333333
