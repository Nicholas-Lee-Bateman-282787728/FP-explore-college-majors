If your child loves things like Little Bear, then they will love this too. I am going to order the DVDs because the kids are arguing about who will get the VHS when they grow up!",1269820800,,349,4.0

8344242,5,B001ULDK50,"How is it possible for a friendship between two fictional, animated characters to touch a grown woman so deeply?  I honestly feel a little silly tearing up watching a children's cartoon.  But this is an uncommonly warm and delightful production.  As another reviewer said, sweet media breeds sweet children.  I don't hesitate to show these animated 5 minute shorts to my 2 1/2 year old.  She loves them, as do I.  The stories are simple, fun, and beautifully illustrated, with perfect voices and music.  The program moves at a slow enough pace to not be jarring to small children, yet keeps their interest.  Perfect for the very young and the young at heart!",1376006400,2,658,4.761061946902655
8344243,5,B001ULDK50,"This is one of the best children's programs I have ever seen.  My two-and-a-half year old daughter loves it and so do I.  Mouse and Mole are two friends who accept each other's imperfections, cheer each other up and help each other through life.  These animated short stories are gentle, sweet and fun.  The background music is a perfect complement to the stories, and the illustrations are whimsical and charming.  These simple stories of friendship are refreshingly old-fashioned and there is no content that your child would find objectionable or frightening.  Even as an adult, I find I am strangely comforted watching the cozy little world of Mouse and Mole.  I am very careful about what I allow my child to watch, and I highly recommend this delightful program.",1373932800,,768,4.906976744186046
8344244,5,B001ULDK50,"My youngest granddaughter and I watched Mouse and Mole Vol. 1 on VCR together when she was a small child; we both loved it so much and watched it so many times we wore it out.  At the time I looked for more volumes but was unable to find them, so when I saw you offering Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 I knew I had to have them. They will be a gift for my granddaughter who in college now, but they have to stay at my house until she has children of her own.  It is such a lovely little story with an array of valuable life lessons.",1373155200,,519,3.7522935779816513
8344245,5,B001ULDK50,Our children loved this movie series when they were small and it is a wonderful movie to watch with our handicapped daughter even today!  Oh the joys of going down memory lane!,1358208000,,176,4.5
8344246,2,B001ULDK50,"I purchased these Volume 1 & 2 and am not certain that they are really licensed copies. They Quality is OK but they the appear that they were ripped from the video tape at a fairly low scan rate. Thus while I had looked for these a long time I am only partially satisfied. The VHS set was not great, but these appear even worse. I have only watched this on a computer screen and might appear better on a TV Screen which treats the Video a little different than a laptop d",1277251200,,471,4.075268817204301
