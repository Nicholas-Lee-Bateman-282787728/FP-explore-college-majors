172003,5,0898707390,"I had been trying to get a copy of this for decades.  I knew Terry Knapp from when I lived in Hawaii.

This is not light entertainment, but a very reflective look at Father Damien.",1382486400,2,180,4.114285714285714
172004,5,0898707390,I've been looking for this video for years because I knew it was out there somewhere.  Even though this was a used copy it's excellent.  Anyone wanting to see a great drama with marvelous acting will want to see this one.,1350604800,2,221,4.365853658536586
172005,5,0898707390,"I watched this great film many years ago on my local PBS station. It's a true story perfectly reenacted! When it was over I began sobbing. Father Damien is a true hero. Everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation should watch this film because the message about risking one's life for those you love is a universal one!",1274918400,,327,4.754385964912281
172006,5,0898707390,"Father Damien is being made a saint at the Vatican this week, and here is a timely and evocative tribute: a one-man show about Father Damien's life, preserved on video from a PBS/theatre performance about thirty years ago and then put on DVD. Acted with passion and commitment and full of heart.  The writing is likewise evocative and passionate.  Catholics in particular may enjoy this DVD to find out more about the Church's new saint (Sept. 2009), but this DVD is likely to be a joy to anyone interested in people and in life -- and I hope that's a lot of people!  If you want to explore what it takes for a person to become a saint, watch the DVD.  If you want to see a great example of what makes us act with courage and love,  watch this DVD.  Where there's life, there's hope -- and vice versa!  Inspiring stuff...!",1254182400,3,822,4.368421052631579
172007,5,0898707390,"There is little I can add to the very well written customer review by Gary Lee Morrison.  I first saw this production on TV on PBS many years ago, and I have been privileged to see the play twice in person in recent years, with another actor.  But it is the original, with Terence Knapp, which has remained my most vivid memory, and I was thrilled to see it finally on DVD, after having only a very poor VHS copy (made from TV) in my possession for all these years.  It is a well written, well acted, inspiring play and performance.",1233964800,4,532,4.247524752475248
172008,5,0898707390,"I have lived with ""Damien"" on VHS and in my memory for many years. I saw the original broadcast in Hawaii.  While my VHS is now gone, we can be grateful that through this DVD production this excellent play and brilliant performance will be preserved for the future. The former head of the Drama department at the University of Hawaii, the professional actor Terence Knapp plays Father Damien in this one man tour de force. He gives a truly great performance in a play that is beautifully written by Aldyth Morris. This is one of those performances that is not to be missed. Terence Knapp captures your attention and interest from the very first lines and never lets you go. You are with him all the way - through Father Damien's dreams, doubts, tests and difficulties. Only those whose souls are deadened will not well up at the final scenes. This is a performance which captures the essence of a great man who sacrifices himself for others, whose love and will to service for others emerges from doubts and setbacks for the pure love of God and not for any earthly honors or titles, and from this simple man comes the real triumph of the human spirit. Although Father Damien's struggles and service among the lepers in the leper colony of Moloka'i are rooted in his deep commitment to his Catholic faith, his story transcends the religious and will resonate with every viewer regardless of individual faith. As a Baha'i I can see the universal values of spiritual love, service, and a life of sacrifice and commitment to God. Knapp's transcendent performance captures the essence of Father Damien and universalizes his life to such an extent that you will have trouble thinking of Father Damien in any other way. It's a performance that gets under the skin; you can't forget it. Knapp is Damien.  Although I assume this ""Damien"" has remained virtually unknown and undiscovered outside Hawaii where it originated, thanks to DVD ""Damien"" can be preserved and now be shared with millions.  Highly recommended",1215388800,9,2006,4.808695652173913
