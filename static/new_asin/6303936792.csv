7856790,1,6303936792,"In this low-quality exploitative feature, it is a viewer's patience that will be most exploited, since the direction, script, and acting are nearly always embarrassingly shabby in a story of a private detective who, while investigating a homicide, falls in love with the obvious suspect, a young madame who manages a small stable of call girls. The P.I., a former police detective terminated due to his commission of a ""technical error"" (i.e., broadsiding a schoolbus while under the influence of cocaine, killing two students in the process), is hired by a mobster (Robert Z'dar) to retrieve two million dollars in cash that was stolen from him when a henchman was murdered during a tryst with a harlot, and finds himself in the soup with his employer due to substantial investigative expenses. As with most movies of this stamp, the action frequently halts so that we may gaze upon bared breasts, buttocks, or whatever, but the plot itself has so many continuity flaws, along with shabby post-production efforts, uneven direction and unintentionally comedic dialogue (the private eye and his lover discussing the orchestral works of Sibelius is freakish), that this is one it would be best to permanently overlook.",1146700800,3,1216,5.146464646464646
