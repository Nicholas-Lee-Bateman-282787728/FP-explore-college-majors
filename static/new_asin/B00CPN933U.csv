5732565,2,B00CPN933U,Not realistic. It would take pages to describe and detail all the unrealistic aspects. It was definitely a waste of money. I am giving it two stars just so I do not hurt any feelings.  :(,1369526400,5,187,4.194444444444445
5732566,3,B00CPN933U,"Sarah (Kate Bosworth) has an idea to spend time with her girlfriends camping on a remote island. Abby (Katie Aselton) and Louise (Lake Bell) have old boyfriend issues they need to still come to terms with. While on the island they bump into some hunters/poachers, three guys recently dishonorably discharged from the military. They hit it off fine, especially Abby and Henry (Will Bouvier) until tragedy strikes and the film takes on Rambettes vs seasoned killers with guns.

I thought I would never get tired on these type of films, but I believe I have reached my saturation limit. The film is typical of the genre except the hunters lacked the personality to make this short film entertaining. Alex (Anslem Richardson) was a confusing character, poorly scripted. The theme is that we all do things that apologies don't mend, and centers around Abby who was wronged. Later Abbey tries to change how people feel through an apology. Might make for a rental if you like this type of film. Not the best of its kind.

5732567,4,B00CPN933U,"This is an excellent, extremely tight thriller. It's only 80 minutes long, and not a single moment is wasted - you learn everything you need to know about the three female protagonists and their relationships to each other long before they get in trouble. The story is sort of a cross between Deliverance and The Descent, except that the women aren't strangers to the area - they've just gone away and come back. It's very well filmed, using its outdoor locations well and showing how being familiar with an area can give you a real advantage over someone who doesn't. The violence is realistic and not excessively gory - this isn't a horror movie, although it's definitely scary. All the actors are very good, and you'll be surprised who makes it to the end and who doesn't. Highly recommended.",1369440000,14,795,4.726618705035971
5732568,1,B00CPN933U,My title tells it all. The storyline and the acting are not convincing whatsoever. The most believable part was when the girls suffer from hypothermia and go nude. I guess the writers had to throw something in to keep people watching,1369440000,7,233,4.7073170731707314

Anyway, I think we all get the idea that the amount of individuals that are capable of doing horrible acts like this are far greater in number than most of us realize. The film is produced very well and brings home the idea of, do not forget your cell phone with extra charged batteries, and do not go to a place where there is no coverage.
If you go to work everyday or ride the bus or commuter trains, go shopping, or you are out in the public for whatever reason, there is a very good possibility that you have sat next to a person that are capable of taking another's person's life without any remorse whatsoever.

5732600,4,B00CPN933U,"I went into this thinking it would be some silly, typical, survivalist movie with bad acting, bad dialogue and an unrealistic story line.  I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong on all counts.  I am baffled as to how many gave this movie a low rating.  I have a feeling its the 'band wagon' affect.  Where a few follow the other reviews...anyway.  The story was pretty realistic: friends in a group plus alcohol, plus bad choices equals trouble.  Well, they found themselves some trouble.  It happens all the time.  The writing was good.  I couldn't find any cheesiness in the dialogue and it flowed well.  The acting was very believable.  Those girls WERE fighting for their lives and they looked like it.  SO many times female protagonists being chased or tormented are shown to be going through hell, but still manage to look sexy or still have on their makeup.  Not these women.  They looked exactly how they would and should going through what they did; black eyes, busted lips, rat nest hair, bloodied up and zero makeup.  So I disagree with another reviewer who insists that their attractiveness was unrealistic.  If they still looked attractive, it's because you can't hide natural beauty, even after being beaten and hunted.  This movie deserves much more credit.",1455408000,4,1272,4.841860465116279

The movie does not start getting good until one of the women accidently kills the guy that is attacking her after she changes her mind about going all the way with him. That is when the action begins and the two guys feel so loyal to the guy that was killed that they start to hunt the women down to kill them.

5732647,2,B00CPN933U,"Sarah (Kate Bosworth) has invited her childhood friends Lou (Lake Bell) and Abby (Katie Aselton) to return to a remote island off the Main cost that they once spent time at in their youth.  She leads them there to try and repair the estranged relationship between the two women after Lou had slept with Abbys fianc&eacute;e years earlier.  While camping, the girls meet three younger men who have come to the island to hunt.  The men reveal they are all former military vets who were dishonorably discharged for an incident in the Middle East.  A drunken Abby begins flirting with Henry, leading him off into the woods.  But when he tries to rape her, Abby hits him in the head with a rock, accidentally killing him.  Now, Henrys two friends Derek and Alex are out for revenge against the three women, hunting them down on the tiny island.

Black Rock is another one of these empowered women fighting back films similar to I Spit on your Grave and Girls Against Boys.  This one falls somewhere in the middle of those two films being not nearly as good as I the former but not nearly as awful as the latter.  The problems are numerous.  First, Aselton, who also serves as the films director, does a poor job of building sympathy for her character.  Henry actually ignores several of Abbys drunken advances before she runs off to the woods to go to the bathroom and uses a flashlight to get his attention and lead him into the woods.  Once there, it is she who throws herself at him.  Ok, Henry ignored her demands to stop but why even play the scene like this to begin with?  Why create shades of grey in a film that has such a predictable plot?

Even worse, the characters are not very bright.  One can hardly imagine these guys surviving in a war zone when three trained ex-soldiers, armed with high-powered rifles and shotguns, cant manage to find three unarmed girls from the suburbsand CANNOT tie them up well enough to keep them from escaping when they do capture them.  Derek has several opportunities to kill the women but prefers to be a two-bit melodramatic villain and preen gleefully.  If he had a mustache he would no doubt have been curling it in his fingers.  The female characters are irritably predictable.  Despite their feud, Abby and Lou finally make amends, bonding in the buff in a gratuitous nude scene that was completely unnecessary.",1438387200,3,2357,4.6201923076923075
5732648,5,B00CPN933U,"I probably would have given this movie 4 stars but 5 to balance out the ratings a bit. Still this is much better than I expected based on the ton of other 3 star rated movies I've seen lately.
The soldiers act like actual soldiers in a few ways... soldiers don't openly and easily talk about their experiences to people who haven't been in the military, and they will talk even less if they did something negative enough to be dishonorably discharged. Soldiers can also be amazing if they train and practice, but they don't magically turn into Rambo when they join, so their lack of skills makes sense considering we know they weren't the best.
The performance of the women was good as well, although there were definitely a few spots where they suddenly forgot to be smart. I would guess the writer/director didn't want to make it seem like they were too extraordinary, or make things too easy for them, but when they were smart it was more realistic.
This movie is a thriller, definitely not a horror, and it did have a good edge of your seat feel. The kills were bloody but only as much as they had to be with close fighting, no random stupid accidental chainsaw deaths or elaborate traps. That also kept the movie realistic. This isn't a movie that'll win awards, but it's definitely higher up in my list of thrillers that I'll watch once.",1437609600,4,1343,4.530864197530864

The acting, by the 3 leading female roles, was decent.. the major issue with this screenplay is that it attempts to realistically portray an unrealistic situation.. In no world, would those women have walked off of that island alive when hunted by 2 trained military vets(or just the 1), who have just returned from a 3rd tour, dishonorably discharged  essentially for 'war crimes', which was implied to be ruthless hostility outside of the rules of engagement.. so lets just throw that aspect of the tale right out the window, because the agenda of the writer should be pretty clear.. the subjective aspect of the film for me is the portrayal of all 3 women as the victims.. whereas only 2 where truly victims of the circumstance.. the 3rd woman created the situation with foolish and thoughtlessly dangerous behavior that women older than age 18 should know not to do, without putting themselves at high risk.. I believe the filmmaker may have tried to include some ambiguity on the concept of her as a survivor/hero in the last frame, by implying some inner-conflict in that character.. all in all, this movie came across to me as a wannabe fantasy land directed towards feminists..definitely not my cup of tea",1426032000,2,1237,4.913875598086125

5732685,4,B00CPN933U,"I just finished watching director Katie Aseltons excellent women vs. men wilderness survival thriller Black Rock, and I was mightily impressed. Theres a lot that I could discuss about it; easiest would be to write a youve come a long way, baby meditation about  how the role of women in horror movies has changed and is changing. Compared to a movie such as the original 1970s Toolbox Murders, its easy to see that today horror movies are much more about women fighting back against impossible odds, and that this makes for more compelling stories.

But its also an excellent example of the fact that horror movies can be far more character driven than they get credit for. The movie starts off with a well observed sketch of three childhood friends in their late 20s/early 30s, Sarah (Kate Bosworth), Lou (Lake Bell) and Abby (Aselton), whose relationship has been poisoned ever since Lou slept with Abbys now ex-boyfriend. Sarah has lured them on a getaway vacation to Black Rock, and island where as ten-year-olds the three built a fort and buried a time capsule, in hopes that she might reconcile her two friends.

If I may coin a term, I would say that this is a movie that starts quiet. Theres no adrenaline rush, no kill scene to whet the appetite of the gorehounds in the audience. Rather, we get to spend the whole first act watching these characters in their natural state, facing the same sort of obstacles that most of us face in our everyday lives. If done badly, as in the recent indie effort Playing Hooky, this sort of opening proves very quickly that the creative team behind the movie really has nothing interesting to share about the characters or the world they inhabit. But when done well, as in the story created here by Aselton and developed into a screenplay by Mark Duplass, the viewer really feels that the movie could stand on its own without the horror element. Which does eventually come, mind you, once our three heroes encounter three hunters fresh from Afghanistan and a dishonorable discharge whose frightening details are left to the imagination.

Its not long before the men are hunting the women, and the women are discovering survival skills they never thought theyd need to use. But even when the focus shifts to stealth and spear making, the tension between the characters continues to be explored and developed upon.

A movie like this underscores the transformations that a fearsome experience can induce in peoples lives. The fact that Aselton and Duplass are savvy to this is brought up in the first few minutes of the movie when Sarah, desperate to get her friends to agree to go on the trip, pretends to have cancer. She can only keep up the pretense for a minute or so, but after she blows her cover she delivers an interesting little spiel about how we could any of us be hit by a bus at any time and it would all be over.

Im not trying to say that all horror movies are actually Steel Magnolias as heart. What I am saying is that theres a lot more room in the genre than people might expect, room for serious character development, room for laughs, mystery, and most especially what we are and what it is we have to do before that frightening curtain of mortality comes down, as it must for all of us.",1423440000,8,3250,4.614186851211072
5732686,1,B00CPN933U,"I want to give this more than 1 star.  I just don't think I can with the bad acting (particularly of the villain) and, even worse, the atrocious screenplay.  An example: in the moments after 2 of the 3 barely escape repeated gunshots from 2 rifles and should be in shock otherwise from seeing the third hit with a bullet, the 2 are hiding out and soaking wet in the cold and scared for their lives.  In other words, it's a moment that in reality would have them in pure survival (or shock) mode (with nothing else possibly on their mind but sadness for their fallen friend), and yet one of them thinks to bring up how she's sorry for sleeping with the other's fiance' and then they laugh about it in a 10 minute conversation in an 82 minute movie.

C'mon, that's ridiculous.

I cannot, in good conscience, give this more than 1 star.  I find only 2 things positive to say about this movie:  1) the actresses are attractive (even though they have black eyes through 2/3 of the movie); and, 2) you only have to suffer through it for 82 minutes.",1423353600,3,1042,4.34020618556701

Acting and pacing was commendable and although there was some awkward dialog and a few inexplicable, blatantly contrived situations, Black Rock was classy and not prurient, with an emphasis on interpersonal relationships and the consequences of life choices made by the women.

With the women owning up to their mistakes and coming clean to each other, the black hat/white hat dynamic between they and the male pursuers was more realistic.  The ending was predictable and needlessly messy but overall I thought Katie Aselton (Director) did a great job with both acting and directing.

Call it sexist, but what was most surprising to me was that while this is not really a gory film, it is a very brutal one- virtually everyone takes an upclose, intense beating at some point, and we see it in very close detail.

BLACK ROCK seems like a promising movie in the beginning and I was intrigued by the idea of the women trying to bond again after many years on a camping expedition that would include a treasure hunt for items from their childhood.  When the men enter the picture at first it was ok, then later more dramatic.  Yet, I quickly lost interest in the acting and drama when every other word was ""f**k"" or ""f***ing""
I mean seriously - couldn't the writers come up with anything else?
And to have one of the men not completely agree with his friend on what to do to the women, yet go along with him was frustrating - couldn't the guy have a backbone??

I kept hoping for some sort of surprise or turnabout, but was disappointed with a completely predictable plot that lacked real imagination and an unrealistic ending. Add in the nude women part thrown in just to show some skin and you have an ok movie that lacks what it takes to really capture the interest of the audience after the first 20 minutes or so.

5732715,3,B00CPN933U,"Well, I rarely see movies that deserve that 3 Stars ""It's Okay"" rating so perfectly.  The film is uneven, pretty good in a few areas and pretty lacking in others.  First, I have to admit that I a love Duplass and Aselton.  So I will probably check out anything they do.  But mediocre is mediocre.

The acting is uneven: the girls can act.  The soldiers?  Not so much.  To be fair, I did not believe Aselton's crying.  But everywhere else she is a pro.

The action is uneven: some of it looked like pulled-punches kind of stuff.  And the blood is very fake.  Like old melted jelly beans and tomato sauce puree with some ketchup and a melted blow pop thrown in for good measure.  They needed the advice of a few cops, MMA fighters, or a fight choreographer.

The plot is uneven.  It starts out like a chick flick--a bit amusing, a bit annoying, but with some potential interpersonal conflicts raging.  Then the girls make some bad decisions that are not really justified.  Aselton's character goes off the wall, but we don't really know why.  The soldiers are meat-head pieces of trash who did something naughty during the war, but we never know exactly what and why.

Then, toss one suddenly slutty girl into the woods with a meat-head, play the date rape challenge game, and mix thoroughly.  The conflict begins.  Men versus women on an island so far away from everybody that no one hears gun shots, but it only takes a few minutes to get there by some dingy old boat--and people fish everywhere nearby.

To the point, the boys do things that make no sense. The girls do things that make no sense.  Then everybody gets into a deep woods chase and kill.  The ones who get off the island look like the next people cast for Walking Dead.

Once the idiocy and unexplained character actions stop, the movie gets good enough to watch.  There are a couple mild surprises and one big one on the beach before it ends.

While I admire all the work a single person puts into such an effort, the truth is that most of these films turn out to be a little strange, Black Rock is no exception. Three life long best friends decide to reconnect on a weekend retreat, to a small secluded island, where they had a lot of childhood memories. Once there, they run into a pack of hunters. Testosterone and alcohol mix, leading to a vicious assault, leaving one group a member short, and the other group on the run. Katie Aselton is the Writer, Director, & star of this film and while I admire what she put into it, the truth is that it was very predictable and didn't make a whole lot of sense. First of all, these three women, as children were allowed to play on a secluded island in the middle of nowhere, without supervision? It also doesn't make sense that the hunters would be there, when there was seemingly no wildlife, and of course there had to be exactly three of them. Finally, why did three women, spending a weekend alone on a secluded island, bring enough alcohol to fuel a Todd Phillips movie? The whole thing was just a little too weird to be believable, and when you add how predictable this film was, it's just a recipe for disaster. The one thing I liked was the performance of Jay Paulson. He's usually a guy who gets bit parts and guest appearances here and there, but he was very solid and the most believable of the six characters. Aside from that this is a slow, painfully predictable, mess of a film, that really doesn't have a whole lot going for it.",1405900800,,1716,4.365625

At the end of this video, I wouldn't call it a film because it lacks just about everything that a film entails, you will be scratching your head wondering who the people were that are responsible for such a devoid, horribly misconstrued abomination.  It is so blatant and idiotic.  It is contrived beyond belief.

Everyone finds themselves on an island, where three war veterans are hunting for ""deer"" (the script writer doesn't know that deers are not found on small islands I guess).  Apparently three war veterans can't do away with three cantankerous, skinny women who do nothing but argue.  Two people get killed.  One who is a woman, all because she stood up at night, when a war veteran was ""ready"" for her.  Okay.

The two war veterans do nothing but argue as well.  The two cantankerous, skinny women go out at night to ""undig"" an old time capsule that has a pocket knife so they can ""fight back"" against the two war veterans, who must be morons as well.  Apparently they can find their way around in the dark with relative ease.

Guess how it ends?  It stands up there with ""Olympus Has Fallen"" (2013) as totally idiotic.",1396396800,,1173,4.608695652173913
5732756,4,B00CPN933U,"There may be spoilers.

Sometimes I try out a movie I've never heard of, often for different reasons.  I had recently seen Lake Bell's feature film directorial debut (""In a World..."") and loved the movie.  Here, she returns to her regular job as an actress playing Lou, one of three childhood friends, coerced into camping out on a thickly wooded island in the middle of a Maine lake where they grew up.  The instigator of this reunion is Sarah (Kate Bosworth).  The third woman is Abby played by Katie Aselton who also directed and wrote the story.

Abby and Lou have a history going back a few years which caused a split in their friendship.  Sarah, still friends with both, wants them all to be happy buddies again.  The first act, nicely staged by Aselton, in this her second director job, shows the girls as...well, girly.  Petty, holding a grudge, Abby in particular is not very likable.  Once the ladies motorboat over to the island and set up camp, they are startled by 3 dudes armed with rifles.  Hunting deer they say.

Abby recognizes one of the guys as Henry (Will Bouvier), the younger brother of another classmate.  As it turns out these are recently discharged soldiers (Jay Paulson, Anslem Richardson) who served several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Abby invites them to share a campfire and a bottle of Jack Daniels.  Lou and Sarah are cautious and become more concerned when Abby gets drunk and starts flirting with Henry.  Buoyed by a fine screenplay by Mark Duplass (Aselton's real life husband), the ladies change ever so slowly under duress.  And as slow as these changes come with the women, it is just the opposite with the guys.  That is really my only nit to pick.  They go from shy, decent guys to raving maniacs in a heartbeat.

Yes the film has hints of ""Deliverance,"" ""River Wild"" and ""Most Dangerous Game"" but the excellent performances, strong photography and a brilliant musical score provide and believable thriller.  I also perked up after Lou and Abby have to disrobe in the woods.  Not for the usual titillation but for legitimate survival reasons.  This is a strong film with excellent production values and terrific performances by the ladies.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray version of the film comes in full 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The movie was digitally shot and the daytime scenes look great including the dense forestation.  Colors here are nothing to shout about as Aselton obviously wanted to tone things down with varying shade of grey, but some of that is the June weather of Maine I suspect.  The audio is excellent with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  There is plenty of woodsy sound all around and the dynamic range is very good.  Dialog is clear and consistent throughout the film.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with Aselton and Bell, a piece on the excellent soundtrack, a short but interesting behind the scenes piece and a trailer.",1394409600,,2965,4.775590551181103

Angry, the man is furious and tries to rape her. She kills him and as a result puts her two friends in immediate danger and the three women struggle to stay alive while being hunted down by the two remaining men. Mind you, all three of these guys were dishonorably discharged from the military for some undisclosed reason they never mention.
This whole situation could have been avoided had Abby kept sense in her head and remembered that she was married. Instead, she not only invites the total strangers to dinner with them at their campsite, she gives them liquor, and leads them on. Gee, I wondered what was going to happen.

5732787,3,B00CPN933U,"Meh. Normally do a little fact-checking to make sure I've got character and actor names correct before I go into a review, but this movie was so generally bland that I don't have the spirit for it. It follows three women -- once childhood friends -- who decide to go camping on an island they used to love as kids, and where they have a buried treasure/time capsule. Two of the ladies don't exactly get along so well, due to a years-old discretion that it would take you one guess to figure out. While there, they come across another person from their youth: a young man who is accompanied by two quiet buddies, the three of them on the island for a hunting trip. After one of the women gets entangled in a violent altercation, the situation spirals out of control and we find our heroines fighting for their survival.

Done by the Duplass brothers (who are known for more quietly dramatic, humanized fare), this film has a straightforward feel that might appeal to people with simpler tastes. There's not a lot going on in the plot or the characters that isn't rehashed from hundreds of other movies that came before. In fact, the only real interesting fact is that two of the women -- one of whom is also the director of the piece -- I've only ever seen before in comedies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-League/dp/B00AB65T7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The League</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Childrens-Hospital/dp/B00CA4S3DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Childrens Hospital</a>). They do really good jobs switching over to the drama here -- including what I would call a pretty brave nude scene -- but their characters don't inspire a whole lotta interest.

There are a few scenes and moments that provide a moment's shock or pathos, but overall it definitely feels like the low-budget indie that it is. Duplass and company are known for low-key, simplistic films, but deeply drawn characters and intriguingly dramatic plots have usually made that simplicity seem like a poetic contrast to the complexity underneath. Here the simplistic writing only bogs the running time down and makes it look like a plain pup jumping through all of the standard thriller hoops, right down to it's over-long and not-all-that-surprising climax and conclusion.",1376006400,,2345,5.386920980926431

5732790,3,B00CPN933U,"This movie will take a lot of suspension of disbelief to get through. The story is pretty basic. Two sets of three friends are on a deserted island off the coast of Maine. In the group of women, two of them are estranged, and are basically conned into going camping by the third one. The three men have recently been dishonorably discharged from the military, which is pretty much all the set up they be for being bad guys. One of the guys ends up dead after trying to rape one of the women, and the other two decide to try and hunt down and kill the three women. There is more to it than that, but not a lot more. That is the gist of it.

The fact that the movie is short, just an hour and 20 min, is good and bad. On one hand it gets in and out quickly and does not try to do too much. On the other hand there is little to no character development at all, especially for the male characters. And it is just hard to buy that both of them would decide that instead of going to the police, the better option would be to go ""Running Man"" (for those of you over 30, for those under ""Hunger Games"")on the girls.

There are certainly some of the cliche thriller/suspense movie stuff going on. Bad decisions when trying to get away. The moment they decide to stop running and hunt the hunters and about 10 min of gratuitous nudity. It is definitely not a movie that will appeal to everyone, but if you accept it for what it is, and do not expect an academy award winner, it is entertaining enough to kill an hour + when you want to watch TV.",1375488000,,1535,4.096345514950166

The ladies are on a camping trip and must put aside their differences after they meet three men who are okay at first...but then one of them tries to rape one of the women. Her actions lead to a chain reaction of events that leave more dead. I just won't say who or how many.

All the cast members and director and production team did a great job with this taut screenplay.",1375228800,,426,4.195121951219512

5732795,4,B00CPN933U,"I see this film getting a lot of bad reviews and I'm not really understanding why.  The three leads are likable enough where I would have watched a non-thriller about them reuniting during a vacation and settling their issues.  However, once the plot kicked in the film got even better.  It's not too often you get a film like this where you genuinely care enough about each character to not want to see anything happen to them, and that's what made this film suspenseful.  The low budget definitely helped here too, because the fight scenes come off much more brutal and realistic, I was reminded of some of the grittiest survival thrillers of the 70's during the film's conclusion.  If it wasn't for the three ladies (and I think Katie Aselton directing definitely helped) and their relationships, perhaps I wouldn't have cared for this movie so much.  But they were definitely enough to keep my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end and I felt satisfied when the film ended.",1373241600,21,986,4.703488372093023

When a fatal accident happens the girls relaxing weekend turns into a fight for survival. There are movies that are made that you have to really pay attention to and make you think. While this is very entertaining this is not one of those kind of movies. The movie is really nothing that deep but I did enjoy it. Be prepared for it though, some parts are very gory and a little hard to watch. On the other hand this is a ""girl power"" type movie so it does have that going for it. If you like movies like the Perfect Getaway then you will like this one as well. It was entertaining and a good watch but nothing that will keep you talking or thinking. Overall, fun and exciting but nothing that original. I liked it though. I give it a B",1372118400,9,1036,4.2639593908629445

5732803,4,B00CPN933U,"The basic premise of this film is that of 3 girls who travel to an island for a weekend getaway. but unbeknownst to them there are 3 guys who are there to hunt animals. there is some partying / drinking between the six of them and then when there is an attempted rape, all hell breaks loose. it is the gals against the guys and the guys have weapons while the gals are defenseless. Kate bosworth and her girlfriends are really cute and between them are able to survive most of the film. Was hoping that they would all make it out alive but sadly only one survives. one of the gals (bell) is really quite attractive and is constantly arguing with her friends about previous love affairs. they soon forgive each other when the going gets tough and make a great team for fighting the guys. a scene that would have been better (if it only had been daytime) was where they change out of their wet clothes and then proceed to run naked thru the woods in search of a lost buried chest. when they find it , they have weapons, and then suddenly reappear in the daytime with dry clothes... did they use a fire to dry them? some more sexiness was sadly lacking in this film.. one can only hope that there is another un-cut version that will be available soon... with more deleted unrated stuff.. a real edge of your seat suspenseful film",1371340800,,1326,4.350806451612903
