8319869,2,B001LV3QE4,"There's plenty lacking with the dvd's, so let's begin. First is the audio quality, it's bad, like really bad. You can barely hear Dr. Weng speak and if you're not fortunate enough to have studied Shuai-Chiao before; I did in college, then this DVD is not going to be for you. If you're looking for an instructional dvd, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. The video quality is ok, but there is poor editing in the DVD. A technique will be shown and all of a sudden a quick cut and now a completely different technique is being demonstrated with no explanation. The discs; I ordered two volumes, also arrived scratched and the cases broken. Luckily for me I have spare cases and my dvd player was able to read them, you may not be as lucky. I would advise to shop for a different DVD, if you can find one.",1498003200,,799,4.369127516778524
