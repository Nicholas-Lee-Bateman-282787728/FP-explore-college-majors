8483344,5,B005QEYPS8,"I'm hoping there remains a need for this video in the U.S. with threats of a ban on guns. As it stands, we bought this for our children who still only use toy guns, with our oldest moving into airsoft ""weaponry."" All of the kids enjoy watching the comprehensive DVD. They know that it's a must if they plan on using any potentially dangerous guns, whether Nurf, airsoft etc. We haven't decided when we'll let them shoot BB guns or go to the firing rang, but this DVD has taught them virtually everything they need to know when the time comes.",1358294400,3,542,4.376237623762377
