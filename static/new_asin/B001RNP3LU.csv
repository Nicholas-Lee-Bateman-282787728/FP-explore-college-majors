A man is working in his laboratory and is interrupted when his daughter Dorothy arrives. Mr. Wynant has an invention that must be kept secret. He discovers that $50,000 in government bonds is missing from his safe. He asks his secretary and girl friend Julia Wolf to return the money, then walks off into the dark night and disappears. Later his daughter Dorothy asks Nick Charles to find her father. Nora drops by with her dog Asta. Wynant's lawyer McCauley doesn't know where he is, but has been sending money. The ex-Mrs. Wynant goes to see Julia Wolf, but she won't be seeing anyone. The police begin to question the people who are involved. The film shows the carefree life of the rich during the Depression. Life is nothing but fun even at a hectic Christmas get-together. Nick drinks as if his life depended on it. [Product placement?]

Nick does not investigate the Julia Wolf murder, but the people involved all come to see him. Nick goes along with Lt. Gill to talk to Arthur Nunheim; he ducks out to avoid talking, but afterwards he will talk to nobody. The police are looking for the missing Wynant. [There is some double-entendre between Nick and Nora.] Nick goes to Wynant's closed shop to investigate at night. Nick digs around and finds a clue, following Asta's interest. They estimate height and weight from the clothes - a big man at least 250 lbs. Nick observes something in one of the bones. Do skeletons all look alike? Not to forensic anthropologists today, or even then.

The conventions of murder mysteries was to gather all the suspects while the detective explains how he solved the murder. So they are all invited to dinner. Nick tells why Wynant didn't kill Julia Wolf or Nunheim. The murderer must be sitting around the dinner table! When this is over Mr. & Mrs. Charles return to San Francisco by Pullman train, luxury travel that is gone forever.
