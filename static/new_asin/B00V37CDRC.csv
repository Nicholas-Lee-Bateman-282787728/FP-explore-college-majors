8708979,1,B00V37CDRC,"It's just not very good - it needed a lot more punch and verve, And being a lot dirtier would help. The men are gorgeous, but that won't carry a film alone. Poor script, poor acting, poor film. Even my cat covered her eyes -  see below.",1437177600,5,236,4.0212765957446805

8708981,2,B00V37CDRC,"Preacher son Samuel (Antoine Cleveland) borrowed money from night club owner ""The Bruce"" (Katt Williams). In order to pay it back, Samuel performs on stage as a male dancer.

The film is too much like the recently released ""Chocolate City."" Katt Williams has a few good lines, but nothing to write about.

Guide: F-bomb. Implied sex. Stripper nudity.",1434153600,3,350,5.017241379310345
