8205135,5,B000BSFY3Y,"This is a must dvd for any Roland Fantom owner that is for sure. David Mills, who really knows the instrument, takes a person through all the modes, Patch, Performance and Multitimbre; carefully explaining how they work and then demonstrating what the instrument will do while in that mode. Utilizing closeup photography of fantom screen, David Mills clearly explains and demonstrates how to make the machine work for you. Valuable tips and suggestions are brought forth in this presentation that you just don't get from reading a manual. Frankly. I would miss out on half of what this instrument is about if it wasn't for this dvd manual. If you are not an engineer-tech type and more of an artist, this manual is for you.",1167868800,2,723,4.792
