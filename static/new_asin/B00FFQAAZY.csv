8615372,4,B00FFQAAZY,"Based on my favorite manga, I wish it had more of the manga stuff in it but considering that it's a movie and not a tv series it's understandable. I quite like it though.",1467158400,,170,4.029411764705882
8615373,5,B00FFQAAZY,If you like foreign films this is a good one. While it doesn't follow the manga to the letter it is very well done. it is worth watching.,1448841600,,137,3.9285714285714284

8615375,3,B00FFQAAZY,"I was led to believe that this was an instructional DVD for those of us who are not, shall we say, practiced in the area of romance. Unfortunately, the techniques demonstrated in this show are more appropriate for an intermediate-level lover, if not an advanced lover.  Beginners like myself will have to look elsewhere.",1424736000,,320,4.925925925925926

8615377,5,B00FFQAAZY,"This is a great Japanese romantic movie!! Since I bought it, I have watched it like 6 times or more.
It is about this girl Tsubaki, who is plain and a nerd, and Kyota, who is the it guy every girl wants. Of course like any other love story, the girl and guy, over come obstacles and find a common ground. I am not so great at commentary of retelling stories, but I would recommend this to anyone, who is looking for a great love story or who like watching asian movies. It has great English subtitles. ~ XD",1382745600,,506,4.121212121212121
