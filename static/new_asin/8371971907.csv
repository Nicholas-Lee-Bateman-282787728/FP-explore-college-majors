7900982,5,8371971907,"This is a film which won a Cesar award in 1984, in a tie with A nos amours. It details 50 years of European history through a ball and its patrons who frequent it.

It traces the history of Europe/France/Paris through a popular ball and its patrons in the last century. There is no dialogue which is the gimmick, only dancing and music and the personal interactions of the patrons. If it sounds strange and different it's because it is and is a perfect way to explore the French history. Very impressive, with works by Frederick Chopin, Irving Berlin, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. There is a version of this which should be more available but overall I enjoyed this very much. Would love to see more and would not overlook.

7900984,3,8371971907,"""Le Bal"" (1983) is a silent film directed by Ettore Scola, based on a play written by Jean-Claude Penchenat. In it, Scola gives us a glimpse of French history in the 20th century, reflecting how everything that happened in that country affected a beautiful ballroom and the people that loved to go there to dance.

Pay close attention to music, fashion and moods, and you will notice how much they change from period to period. For example, it is quite interesting to compare what happened in the ballroom in 1936 to the way things were in the early 1980s. I think that there are different ways to study history, and this film is so well-made that it is could easily be considered one of them. Recommended...
