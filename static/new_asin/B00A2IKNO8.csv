8546225,3,B00A2IKNO8,"There's a lively out-and-about feel (despite some unusually Springtime inclement and miserable weather which hampers filming) to this travelogue and Mr Sewell, as befits a man who has devoted his life to fine art, criticism and, following his recent passing, a sizeable collection of renaissance Italian master drawings fetching a small fortune at auction, shows off his eagle eyed knowledge of the subject. As a collector Sewell had a keen eye too, but the eye here in this series, is too often cast over bare buttocks and the more sordid aspects of C18 travel plus the lacivious juices flowing through the average (but that's Eton for you) C18 and C19 aristocratic youth on this privileged path of learning. After a while descriptions of wild oat sowing, if one is not directly engaged in it yourself, get tedious. By the time we got to Siena and yet another titillation pointed out - I was bored stiff!

Still, the actual filming and discussions of the art and buildings is reasonably entertaining. Brian is keen to point out that in an earlier life he held hardened guests at Her Majesty's pleasure in one of her lugubrious ""hotels"" in spellbound attention for hours at a time with his lectures on art. At times I felt like one of them being subjected to constant allusions to sex and low life.

In Sewell's world of art - indeed world of everything - he is always ready to review and critique rather than simply stand back and appreciate. Always, even foreign terms, are ennunciated in the kind of rich plummy public school boy accents that increasingly grate over the course of these shows and offered high comic relief on Dead Ringers for our talented impersonator and voice artist John Culshaw: Brian Sewell requesting elocution lessons from a voice coach over the phone is my favourite sketch from that radio show where Chris Eubanks and Frank Bruno surface in the hilarious conversation. But nothing is as hilarious as the real thing striving for ""street cred"" on the telly. There's not enough of that simple response of stand-back-in-awe in this show. Sewell only stands back to sharpen his knives and start picking.

Michelangelo is clearly Sewell's hero - with Raphael and Leonardo brushed aside and dismissed as almost second raters - with even the ugliest and most gratuitously copied sculpture of the nude male physique of all time, his ""David"", being given unadulterated praise. Andrew Graham-Dixon does a better job than this. But none surpasses the late great Kenneth Clark in his chapter on the Renaissance, in the epic ""Civilisation"", where he gives a perfect summary of ""David"" and its significance (and defects) without drooling over its ""boyishness"" and allows the last works of Michelangelo to find their natural position at the artistic summit of western civilisation.

Sewell is by comparison petty and small minded while encompassing a mass of detail. He wants to be in the youthful skin of the early trivago pioneers - who had it all, more or less, laid on for them with plenty of the ""folding stuff"" courtesy of mummy and daddy back on the enclosed estate at home - including a full size wooden and sprung collapsible bed and comfy mattress which had to be carried and assembled and broken apart for them every night and morn by an entourage of servants who kipped themselves on straw bed rolls.

Sewell obviously has a soft streak for them even shining to these pups' immaturity and crudity. It is frightening the extent to which a 60 plus year old TV presenter can empathise with this level of carnal desire, a prospect which this similar 60 odd year old can only glimpse at, as if looking at a faint planet through a broken telescope.

Byronic - life's pointless after 30 - or disgraceful? Take your pick. Now where's that buttock to leer at...oh that's alright it's only commercial telly with the advertising! Now get down to the corner shop and bring back a Sun under one arm and a pint of milk under the other my good man.",1506988800,,3958,4.796187683284457
