8452784,5,B0051IAWZO,"This computer help program --- which can be watched on a TV --- provides a quick and easy introduction to PowerPoint 2010 on a Windows 7 computer.

Designed and created by an experienced Adult Services Librarian and computer technologies instructor, this program (which is actually pretty fun to watch) will get the computer shy-est of viewers up to speed with PowerPoint 2010 in just over an hour.

Ideal for computer novices, this DVD can be watched on a PC (or a Mac for that matter) with a DVD drive but actually looks better on an HDTV.

High resolution screen recordings, animated graphics and live video are combined with step-by-step instructions to teach the viewer how to quickly create and edit PowerPoint presentations.

Just the basics! There's no technical jargon and/or a lot of stuff that the viewer does not need to know.

Pick up some valuable job skills in just over 60 minutes.

Thanks for reading this review!",1306368000,,930,4.8544303797468356
