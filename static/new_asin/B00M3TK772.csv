6554786,5,B00M3TK772,Awsome anime lots of fan service and good jokes. Not to be taken seriously and definately not for under 16 YO,1416960000,2,109,4.238095238095238

6554788,5,B00M3TK772,"Raul Chaser and his classmates are about to reach their dream: Graduate from Hero school and become Heroes who defend the world by attempting to defeat the Demon King. Except that the Demon King has been defeated, their school closed down, and the Hero Program has been disbanded. In a world without a need for heroes, Raul finds that being able to do fantastic sword moves and power blasts doesn't impress in corporate job interviews, and he ends up reluctantly working in Reon, a magic department store (to the disdain of his former hero classmates, especially Airi Altinate, aka All-A, so-called because she got all As in class), managed by the lovely Seara, and working with the busty Nova. You know the vein of this show when you see a vehicle pulled by a magical dragon and shaped like a certain starship and bearing the logo ""NCC-1701"" on it driven by an old geezer  who regularly buys a single light bulb and grabs Nova's butt (who doesn't mind).

And into the store comes a new employee, Fino Bloodstone, the completely adorable, cute, energetic, sexy and remarkably nave daughter of the late Demon King, who becomes Raul's responsibility to train in both the ways of the department store and the ways of the human world. Meanwhile, a new gigantic magical department store is opening in town. This isn't the first time we've had this theme or variants of it, but this show handles this theme extremely well.

This show is a lot of fun, with humor fan service (yes, bare boobies and butts) and sexual humor, but it is done with humor in mind, not seduction. This show is also intelligent, examining the issue of what happens to those laid off when a war or conflict comes to an end.

This is a harem comedy, though the harem is small, with Raul being the center of attention for former classmate Airi, our show's tsundere, who doesn't want Raul to find out that after scolding him for giving up on being a hero, she's taken a job as a bunnygirl greeter at the new store in town, Amada. We also have Elsa, who works next door at a food/convenience store, who's interested in Raul as well. Raul finds himself more and more drawn to the mostly innocent Fino, who has her own reasons for fleeing to the human world.

The remaining regular cast consists of Loa, the quiet tech girl who mostly does installations and deliveries of magic products, Lam, a demon girl who works with Elsa next girl, and Viser, the male co-manager of Reon and shildhood friend of Seara.

The good news is not every girl in this show is after Raul, though he remains dense about those who are. In a funny scene, he asks Nova about why she puts up with the old geezer feeling her butt, to which she replies she doesn't mind, and that he's welcome to do it as well....with them later having nothing to do while a TV show in the background is interviewing a female about how she ended up in a sexual relationship with a co-worker.

This release also includes the OVA episode, listed as episode 13, where Raul's little sister comes for a visit, with the nudity upped for that episode.

Creating an interesting magical world, with a nice sense of humor, this show is a success. It's light fare, but it is very good light comedy fare.",1414627200,20,3208,4.547660311958405
6554789,5,B00M3TK772,"Raul Chaser is one of the best of the current class of Heroes that will go out to fight the monsters and Demon King, or he would if the Demon King was not already defeated and the Hero school gets shut down.  Now a year later he is working at a magic department store named Leon's to make ends meet, until the day Fiino shows up looking for a job.  Sounds perfectly normal, except for the fact she is the now defeated Demon King's Daughter.  Can he teach this cute and fiesty newcomer the ropes, all while keeping his sanity and showing her about the human world while keeping her secret from those who would prefer her to be the new King and dealing with a competitive store chain.

I watched this on Crunchyroll and I enjoyed it due to the humor and interactions of the cast.  Fiino especially steals the show with her ""evil"" laugh and her energy as she experiences the human world, and she has some of the best lines in the whole show.  While it never truly explains who defeated the King, it does show what can happen when a major issue is removed and how many need to adapt economically and socially.  It was a great series and I can not wait to get it in November.",1406505600,21,1170,4.243243243243243

There is some fan service in that boobs get flashed but the story is well done and more often than not the fan service is done for humor. I do not normally recommend things because if what I recommend does not please who I made the recommendation to, then I feel bad. I recommend this series because it is funny with a take on many issues, not just the war / peace one that are worth taking a look at but does not preach on any of them.",1443744000,,482,3.979381443298969

6554800,5,B00M3TK772,Like all anime it's a bit quirky. I like the fact that its based on what happens after the hero conquers the bad guy. It has fan service mostly in the beginning so be careful around kids. All in all it was good and really deserves a 2nd season,1437004800,,243,3.979591836734694

6554803,5,B00M3TK772,What do you do if you train to be a hero and then your side wins the battle? Well you find an honest way to earn a crust. In this case you work in a shop. As do your former colleagues. This is the story of a group of nearly-heroes trying to adjust to a different way of life. The plot thickens when a  group tries to reopen battle lines and so you could be a hero again. Which way would you jump? This could have been a standard ecchi/harem/fan service special and it probably wouldn't have stood out from the crowd. It does have all these elements but has a sense of humour with a deftly ironic twist. I enjoyed the plot twists and the characters and the mix of magic and modern household appliances. The Lolita factor was low and the voice acting in English was very good. It's not the most serious series but it's fun and the plot is sufficiently different to make it worth watching and enjoyable.,1436400000,,900,4.232558139534884

6554807,5,B00M3TK772,"I found this a very funny and well written anime. With the Demon Lord dead and the demon war over, what's a hero to do but get a job which is exactly what Raul Chaser does. Fino Bloodstone, the Demon King's daughter, finds herself in the same situation as she doesn't want to be the new Demon King. The supporting characters are great as well.

This anime takes the similar premise that ""The Devil Is A Part-Timer"" did, including a rival chain store, but there is much more fan service so there is a boobie alert on this anime. There is a bit more fighting in this also but it is only in a few episodes. Overall this is a comedy and a pretty good one at that.

I am glad I added this to my anime collection.",1432771200,,707,4.115942028985507

6554809,5,B00M3TK772,"Raul Chaser desires nothing more in life than to be a hero and trains his hardest to become one, slaying monsters, protecting villages and getting treasure. However, the demon king is defeated and Raul and his friends from the heroes academy find themselves without work and without a school. In order to make a living Raul becomes an employee at Reon, a small chain box-store that sells a wide variety of magic items including dishwashers, air conditioners and refrigerators.

As he starts to get use to his new life, he is introduced to Fino, who it turns out is the daughter of the demon king and here is where the story truly begins. Raul has an obvious hard time coming to terms with not only working with but having to train the former demon kings daughter. There are many humorous moments revolving around Finos transition to the human world and how she doesnt always understand why humans do not view the world in the same way as demons, which leads to many comedic moments and misunderstandings.

There also humor focused on this being what it is also in part, a harem comedy. Along with Fino, there is Airi, who was a former classmate and hero-to-be with Raul and has a tsundere attitude toward him; Nova, a co-worker of Raul who is very up front and teases him a bit, though perhaps without realizing it and Elsa, the manager of the next door convenience store who is shy and spends times going over catalogs of magical items with Raul. The approach each of them take to have Raul notice them is different and often has comical results.

There is also one minor almost throwaway moments of humor where one customer arrives in a very familiar looking vehicle that has the markings NCC-1701-D on it. As a side note the character voice is said to be the same person who dubbed the character of Captain Picard in ST:TNG.
With plenty of humor and lots of energy brought to the show by Fino, who does steal some of the shows best lines and has one of the greatest laughs as other reviewers have mentioned is one of those characters that feels familiar but has a life and energy all her own.

Overall, while tending more toward a guilty pleasure than a deep plot, it is a great comedy and one that should bring many enjoyable moments and laughs.",1430438400,3,2249,4.545679012345679
6554810,4,B00M3TK772,Reluctantly bought this but was quite entertained. Fino is just a loveable demon king's daughter. It is an interesting interpretation of what happens after fantasy heroes beat the Demon King and are no longer needed.,1430092800,2,216,5.2

6554814,4,B00M3TK772,"This is a slice-of-life comedy set in a fantasy world.  The main character, Raul, was training to be a hero at hero college when the war with the demons suddenly ended, and he was forced to take a job at a magic store (effectively an electronics store) to support himself.  While it's classified as a harem comedy, it doesn't really fit the bill since there are only a few of the female characters who exhibit interest in Raul and none of them try all that hard.  Also, the show focuses more on Raul than on most of the female characters (except for Fino).

As other reviews have stated, while the box identifies this as a TV-14 show it's instead an unrated version that features a lot of fanservice and double entendres, so it's not appropriate for kids.  Also, this is a very minimal presentation- no English dub available (hey, some people like them) and the bonuses consist of nothing but texless versions of the opening and ending themes and a couple of trailers.  For how much it cost, I dropped it a star in my rating for that- if it was either a little cheaper or came with a bit more in the way of bonus material, I'd have given it a full five.",1424476800,,1153,4.364485981308412

6554816,4,B00M3TK772,"Yu-Shibu is a fairly enjoyable anime, and for the price is certainly worth picking up if you're a fan of this genre. The story isn't anything spectacular or really worth remembering, but it is a fun watch for when you are bored.

The buyer should be warned though that a fair amount of the scenes shown are uncensored and ecchi based. This means that you shouldn't show this anime to your kids, unless they're over the age of 17.",1423008000,,429,4.430379746835443
6554817,5,B00M3TK772,"This is another cute girls with big boobs surrounding the main male character. However, it is also something else. Its plot deals with one of the most difficult social problems.
Let's say the world and society you are living have been under the war economy before everyone living today was born; and many plans has been decided to support the war against the demon kingdom, which had been a common rule of the human society since long time ago. The excellent and remarkable were expected to be publicly qualified heroes. But now, the age of the war suddenly collapses and they are useless in the new world. The most of the war industries also go bankrupt. The human world gets the fruits of the new era of peace, which makes most people happy, yet some must pay for the price unexpectedly because the weapon makers, the heroes and their qualifications are now worth to nothing to build and run the new society.
You'll see two complete different main characters. While Raul Chaser, a young man with the broken dream, reluctantly decided to get the current job two years ago, Fino Bloodstone, a girl who should have been the successor to the throne of the demon kingdom, is willingly trying to make herself fit to the new world as a coworker supervised by him.
Raul has some uncomfortable feelings about not being able to be a hero ever since he gave it up; and he had to ask the magic store Reon to hire as nothing but a sales clerk, which was the only company accepted him. But while he takes care of her and sees she care-freely enjoys to work as just a new store clerk, her innocent acts change his mind bit by bit.
I sometimes re-watch this anime again, when I feel depressed about my job even though I willingly selected it. It is natural for you to feel ""I should or should not have done this and that"", ""This can't be true"" or such when everything seems to go completely wrong but probably it isn't as bad as you're currently worrying.",1421280000,6,1941,4.4858757062146895

8670091,4,B00M3TK772,"So far over the top as ecchi that is a parody of ecchi, I gave up counting the homages to TV, movies, and books before I had gotten to the halfway point in the series.  Yes, it is ecchi, but it also plays against itself in that respect because the wannabe hero is actually a HERO, and that the good guys are really the bad guys, and the frequent ""fan service"" sections become more of a ""hey, we gotta do this"" points in the series.

Not for kids, not for those lacking a sense of humor.  It is a comedy with swords, magic, really, really stupid uses of magic, and people who are hopelessly lost in just being themselves.",1527379200,,620,4.19327731092437

8670095,5,B00M3TK772,"- Synopsis: A story about a war ending abruptly, leaving many heroes with no place to go, as peace comes with stipulations. Our main character is miserable about his job in retail, but decides that nothing can be done due to the circumstances. Then comes in a new employee that ends up being the daughter of the deceased Demon King. Despite the hostilities in the beginning, the main character starts to warm up despite their races having been enemies not too long ago. Their silly and peaceful lives are threatened when various instigators attempt to stir up trouble. Thus, their adventures begin once more...
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: One of this anime's strong points is that it refreshingly portrays the lives of heroes in an untraditional way: they aren't basking in glory after winning hard-fought battles. Now, they are fighting on the front-lines with sales and customer service to increase their corporation's reputation while making a living. There's plenty of dialogue and the main character is just getting by. Which is pretty relatable. It seems that heroes don't really know the purpose in their lives when there isn't a battlefield.

- Analysis: The power of bonds is an important thing. Sure it's cliche, but there's no denying it's relevance and importance. After all, just about everybody has some sort of relationship with another. However significant or not. Whether it's a friend, family member, acquaintance, or significant other, having a bond with another helps make life more enjoyable. Not only that, another person can help make up for one's strengths or weaknesses, especially when considering the work force or educational setting.

- Features: Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 13 episodes on 3 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 due to some violence and suggestive scenes. I think it should be TV-MA due to some scenes being uncensored and showing boobs.

- Conclusion: Overall, this anime provides a nice refreshing presentation from the typical heroes that always have to fight to save the world from utter destruction. There's plenty of silly situations. Due to this anime being dialogue-heavy, it is more suited for mature viewers. And there are some uncensored scenes that make for nice eye-candy. Which makes me wonder why it isn't TV-MA.

8670098,5,B00M3TK772,"Some people panned this comparing it to the Devil is a Part Timer, but I liked it a lot.  The world they created where the world runs on magic and the practical use and distribution of it and the appliances is interesting.  So is the mild romantic leanings of the earnest, but mostly clueless demon kings daughter that takes a job in the human world at the appliance big box store where a wanna be hero works as a clerk.  Since the demon king was defeated there's no more room for the classic sword and sorcery type of hero.

I enjoyed the crazy nature of the demon kings daughter who having lived only in the demon realm and knowing the gruesomeness, and torture that her father did as common place and occasionally trying to apply it to the human customers and her co-workers.  Despite her slant on things as a demon, she seems like she has a pure heart, and a desire to succeed and not carry on the legacy of her father.  Most of the characters are interesting in their own way, and the series while short has a relatively definitive ending.  While it may be slightly derivative, it has enough originality for me to recommend it.  Not really something for kids under 12, but other than a little fan service, it's a pretty tame entry.",1465603200,,1236,4.41409691629956
8670099,5,B00M3TK772,"What if you had devoted your whole young life to following your dream to become a soldier, to defend your nation in wartime, to test yourself on the field of battle, and just before you graduated from your service academy, the war was suddenly over, the military was downsized, and with peace finally at hand, nobody cared what you'd tried to do or what you'd learned, and with no marketable skills you had to struggle in the postwar recession to get and hold any sort of job just to get by, struggling through the drudgery a day at a time with dead dreams and no hopes for the future?  This very serious and oft repeated situation lies at the heart of this delightful comedy fantasy adventure.  Our hero Raul Chaser is living that disappointment in this magic filled parody of modern Japan, moping his way through a defeated life, working as a sales clerk in a small and not very successful appliance store where the appliances are powered by magic instead of electricity.  (I've worked as a clerk selling electrical appliances, and it's not all that much different except that problems and defects in magical appliances appear to be more spectacularly and hilariously dangerous.) when his life is suddenly turned upside down by his less-ditzy-than-she-lets-on manager ordering him to train a new hire:

the daughter of the now slain Demon King he once dreamed of heroically fighting.

Said demon girl Fino Bloodstone is a spark plug of energy, ready, willing, and eager to please, but facing a longer than usual learning curve due to her basic ignorance of humanity and what humans consider a ""pleasant shopping experience"".  (Hint: it doesn't involve horror, bloodcurdling screams of terror, or dying.)  Early episodes revolve around Raul trying to train her, clean up her disasters, and conceal her identity from those who still hate demons, while gradually growing fond of her and finding himself inspired by her boundless enthusiasm for selling such wonderful labor saving, happiness bringing appliances, undreamed of in the demon world.  Middle episodes revolve around the struggle to compete with a newly opened giant store that can beat them on price due to having their appliances constructed by monster slave labor; our heroes respond with above and beyond customer service and lots and lots of fan service.  Final episodes involve an evil plot that threatens Fino in particular and their world in general; in order to save her, all of her friends and coworkers are going to have to hero up, and the 13th episode is a later released OVA about Raul's idolizing younger sister (who was never informed about his career change) coming to visit and Raul's friends putting on a fake hero's adventure so Raul can impress her.  (What could possibly go wrong with that?...)

Fan Service?  Hoo-Boy, they've got fan service!  The frequency of wardrobe malfunctions involving blouses, bras, and swimsuits, is so high that one wonders if there is something about making clothes using magic that renders them flimsy?  Or is the practice of wearing them a size or two small exceeding the tensile strength?  Then there is the tendency for magical attacks to dissolve clothing or go tentacular or both, but it's all in good clean fun,... well clean-ish fun, anyway.

All things considered this was a laugh out loud delight that gently salutes the everyday housewares heroes who help you find, purchase, deliver, install, and service the appliances and other products you need in order to make your life better.

Note: This is a pretty bare bones release with English subtitles only, no English dubbing, and only clean opening and closing animation as extras.",1463875200,,3652,4.970443349753695
