3091202,5,B0012KSUT0,"Once in a while you will see a beautiful film that will touch your heart and make you laugh, cry and smile all in one sitting. ""Moondance Alexander"" is such a film. I had the honor of seeing this movie during a film festival, along with my children, and all of us absolutely loved it. The actors in the movie were brilliantly chosen for their roles--Kay Panabaker, Don Johnson, James Best, and the Olympic medalist Sasha Cohen, and was directed by an incredibly talented husband-and-wife team of Michael and Janeen Damian! This movie reflects so many important things in life--it reminds us how we all want to feel accepted by others, about how hard it is to miss someone that you love so much, and also it is also has moments that will make you laugh and cheer! My six-year-old daughter loved this too..she is now asking for a horse named Checkers! :) We are excitedly waiting for the dvd release so we can watch the movie over and over. I wish this had had been in theaters across the nation so more people could see it on the big-screen, but now it will be available to see in everyone's living rooms and have an even wider audience. This is a must-see and a very memorable and beautiful movie for the whole family's dvd library. I highly recommend it!",1205971200,8,1255,4.4847161572052405
3091203,5,B0012KSUT0,Finally a real family film you can take your whole family to see. I think everyone can relate to Moondance she is a shy girl who wants to fit in. I was glad to see how dealing with the mean girls was written in a non-violent positive way. We need more film makers to do more of this type of film. It was also refreshing to see a movie so positive. Having lost my father to lung cancer 27 years ago after watching the film I was able to say I'm OK.You're always pulling for Moondance and Checkers at every jump. Thank you to Michael and Janeen Damian for making a truly heart warming family film,1205884800,8,594,4.129310344827586
3091204,5,B0012KSUT0,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film at its premiere in Salt Lake City, Utah. What a delightful film. It is based on a true story, and is beautifully written. The husband & wife team of Michael & Janeen Damian, did a superb job of writing, producing and directing this magical film. The cast is excellent from darling young actress Kay Panabaker, to veteran TV actors Don Johnson, James Best, & Lori Loughlin. It is a very heartwarming story (I cried 3 times), but is also filled with beautiful cinematography. In my opinion this film should have had a nationwide theatre release. Don't miss adding this excellent family film to your library. It is for all ages from children to senior citizens.",1204848000,69,697,4.67479674796748
3091205,5,B0012KSUT0,Saw this at a festival.  Great cast.  Heart warming and funny story about triumph over odds.  Subtle and poignant directing by Michael Damian (I want to see more of his films!)  A great family film all ages will enjoy.  Shame more films like this don't make it to the big screen.  Don't miss it!,1204761600,6,295,4.37037037037037
3091206,5,B0012KSUT0,"I saw this movie during a film festival.  I wasn't sure I would care for it since it seemed to be a movie done before. Was I ever wrong.  The girl playing Moondance is amazing.  The film is beautiful, touching and funny at the same time.  I highly recommend this to everyone whether you have kids or not.  It strikes a chord in us all.  A must see and buy.",1203638400,11,356,4.014285714285714
3091207,5,B0012KSUT0,"It is about time a heart warming movie came out that the whole family can see. You will be in tears and smiling when watching the struggles and triumphs Moondance goes through. She proves to all, you can do anything if you put your mind to it!!

Warmbloods are the in thing not necessarily thoroughbreds and there would not be a descussion like that in real life bc Checkers is a pinto. Not to say he wouldn't not win bc the judge prefers solid colored horses. Sigh... the horse world is super subjective.",1477612800,,442,4.337349397590361

3091230,1,B0012KSUT0,"if I could give this no stars I would. first, unless you're american indian (as I am partly), who would ever name a kid moondance? secondly, most kids after admitting she has no friends would not keep asking other teens to sign her yearbook. I don't know of a kid who would persist at that misery past two or three rejections so neither of those things are in any sense likely or real. if you like horse movies, there are FAR better ones. spoiler alert: this is typical - sad teen girl finds horse, enters competition and wins first time and it changes her life. it's not worth the $3.99 download. save your money for another horse story like the long shot if amazon prime ever brings that one back. if you're simply looking for feel good and don't care about the possibilities of the events actually happening, then go ahead and get moondance.",1463529600,,844,4.487012987012987

3091305,4,B0012KSUT0,"A good ""feel-good"" movie.  I liked seeing some of the mistakes that the girl made when she first tried to ride the horse, though she's lucky she didn't get herself killed.  I have no doubt that there are plenty of Pintos and other breeds that can jump as well as the Thoroughbreds can.  I'm not entirely certain that winning that contest was the greatest self-esteem booster because you're setting yourself up for a huge disappointment when you do lose, but she did prove her point.  The writers did go overboard with the antagonist.  I went through some stuff similar at that age, but I don't ever remember the other girl(s) being that bad.  It would have been more believable if they'd toned down the comments, or left them out all together and just had the antagonist ignore the MC.  Still, a decent movie for family entertainment.",1410307200,4,834,4.671232876712328

I really enjoyed this movie (again for the story), and I felt it was worth the time spent watching it. I'm a fan of Don Johnson, and he's his usual charming (even if sometimes gruff) self. I thought Panabaker did a great job in role. She made me smile all the time because of her character's spunk and optimism, and she's a good crier (not something a lot of young actors can pull off).

3091355,4,B0012KSUT0,"My feelings concerning horse adventure/competition movies is that most of them are essentially the same.  This movie certainly doesn't stand out among the genre.  A girl stumbles across a horse, falls in love with it and wants to raise it, and eventually partakes in a competition at the end.  Rinse and repeat.  Of course it's easy for me to say these type of horse films are all the same since I have no personal experience owning and raising horses, and therefore my feelings may very well be different from someone who's been raising and caring for them for years.  Sort of like how dog owners can't relate to dog haters... but less drastic, hehe.

Anyway, Moondance Alexander is a really well-written and well made movie about a girl that immediately shows an incredible amount of affection for a horse that happens to jump out in front of her bike while travelling down a back road one day, that she searches for the owner of the horse.  This man happens to look remarkably similar to WWF wrestler Bret Hart (have you SEEN him lately?  He looks just like *this* guy!) so... as you can probably guess, she does everything she possibly can for the horse until the inevitable competition takes place.  Of course she has arrogant and sassy classmates who think THEY have the winning horse.  We've seen the same storyline so many times.  These classmates are of course, the bad guys that wanna see her fail so they can laugh and mock her.  You know where this is going, trust me.

One thing I can't fault is the presentation.  This movie looks REALLY good.  The writing may be predictable but the way the scenery looks and the many segments showing the girl taking care of the horse look absolutely astonishing.  Great job there.  Also, maybe it's just a really big coincidence, but the girl playing this role (Kay Panabaker) looks identical to a few horse caretakers that I know.  Interesting there.  This means she's *perfect* for the role.  Also, a slight similarity to Judy Garland isn't out of the question either.  They both have a way of lighting up the screen when they smile.

My only complaint (other than the predictable writing) is that the actual competition that takes place at the end is based around horse jumps instead of an actual horse race, which means it's not a very dramatic or thrilling (or fitting) conclusion.  Instead it's lacking.  Other than this, it's all the same thing you've seen plenty of times before so you can take or leave this one.",1360800000,,2471,4.679814385150812

But this film, Moondance Alexander, is also outstanding in it's own way, as a family film aimed at families that include at least one member (probably a young girl) who loves horses. For that audience, this is a great movie.  It is a real thrill when the lovely, but socially shunned young teenager, Moondance, encounters her equine friend ""Checkers"" for the first time.  The horse is striking and unusual--a Pinto, (actually American Paint) who, like Moondance,  is something special, but not always immediately appreciated.  The mother-daughter relationship is touching and refreshing., and the movie miraculously succeeds in representing credible teenagers while earning a ""G"" rating.  Note, that's ""G"" not ""PG""!

If you've already seen ""Black Beauty,"" ""National Velvet"" or ""My Friend Flicka,"" you might want to take a pass on ""Moondance Alexander,"" a wan girl-and-her-horse saga that doesn't even have the energy or conviction to rise above its own clichs.

Moondance is a ninth-grade social outcast who finds meaning and purpose in life when she spends the summer taking care of and learning to ride a horse owned by a cantankerous but lovable Pygmalion played by Don Johnson (think of it as an equine version of ""My Fair Lady,"" minus the songs and quality).  The first credibility obstacle we have to overcome is accepting the spunky and attractive Moondance as a girl who can't find herself a single friend (well, the two-legged type anyway).

The paint-by-numbers screenplay comes replete with a miraculous horse healing, a bevy of Valley Girl elitists straight out of Central Casting, and a horse-jumping competition that has all the drama and suspense of a Tiddlywinks tournament in Oshkosh.

Ah well, at least the movie boasts, in the person of Kay Panabaker, a young actress with a great deal of charm and potential.  And, besides, where else are you going to hear a line like, ""Moondance, I want you to take Checkers over to the stables,"" if not in this film?

This horse story (Checkers, a pinto this time) is like most horse stories. You gotta believe the horse will achieve success. Even with the typical super-horse ending, the story is a pleasant diversion into horse and stable life. Perhaps every young girl wishes to have a ""Checkers"" of their own. If they don't, this pleasant movie will give it to them.  But, this story is actually more about Moondance, the rider, than the horse.  And she's just as loveable.

This warm movie demonstrates perseverance as well as the lesson that everyone deserves a chance, and even a second chance.  Lots of second chances given in this movie. It's always rewarding when something of this quality comes from the inspiration of a true story.

3091388,3,B0012KSUT0,"""Saddle Club"" meets ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" and ""Bratz"", as the prettiest friendless teenage girl in cinema history goes up against her ""Queen Bee"" nemesis in a local equestrian competition. Throw in a little ""Pollyanna"" here for good measure as the friendless girl manages to inspire the adults in her town to lead better lives.

Kay Panabaker plays the friendless girl (Moondance Alexander), and Kay is so pretty she makes figure skater turned aspiring actress Sasha Cohen look rather plain by comparison. And Kay is a polished enough actress with enough effortless charm to almost make this film work. Unfortunately she is saddled (pun intended) with one of the worst written scripts you are likely to ever encounter.

The best scenes are those where Panabaker is alone on the screen and the worst are those involving her teenage rivals-the dialog given to these inexperienced cast members is almost surreal in its staggering lameness.

The film is at least one back-story too many as there just isn't time to adequately cover Moondance coping with her father's death, reconciling her mother's new romantic interest, getting flirty with the son of her mother's boyfriend, saving stable owner Donte (Don Johnson) from a wasted life of alcohol abuse, turning her horse Checkers into a competitive jumper, and giving Roscoe P. Coltraine (James Best) a few moments of mild comic relief.

""Moondance Alexander's"" target audience of preteen girls and Sasha Cohen fans wasn't enough for it to get a widespread theatrical release but it is available as a direct-to-DVD product. There is nothing original or exciting here but it is a pleasant enough family film. And the dare to be different theme is handled quite nicely.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1227657600,3,1778,5.054607508532423

3091391,3,B0012KSUT0,"A sweet family movie. Who would think Don Johnson had a family movie in him? THe acting is okay for the story. Sasha Cohen as a vain non-friendly person was sad to watch.

A friendless young girl finds a companion in  a pinto pony named Checkers. She trains the horse to compete in a horse-jumping show.

I can recommend this movie to the whole family.",1219363200,5,352,4.384615384615385

3091393,5,B0012KSUT0,"My Wife and I watched Moondance Alexander, last evening.  We were entranced! It was obviously a real and personally inspired story. The young lady, Moondance was a beautiful and charming actress. Our favorites were The Mother, played by Lori Laughlin and Dante, played by Don Johnson.

It was obvious that Dante was an effective Trainer. He was also an enigematic personable character in the beginning! As the movie progressed... Moondance became his healer and in turn he became her encourager, and major influence to fill-in for her deceased Father! My Brother in Kansas is a lover of horses who owns and trains quarter horses. He often comments that working with horses everyday is far better than working with people! Since he is a Retired Army Officer, he should know!

Everyone with teenage daughters should view this Movie, along with their Daughters! Gratefully, Retired Chaplain Fred W. Hood",1216944000,10,900,5.108843537414966
3091394,5,B0012KSUT0,"The night before I had the misfortune of watching ""Picture This"", which I quickly turned  off because it was garbage.  Luckily while watching the previews for other movies, I came upon ""Moodance Alexander"". It was a terrific family movie!  Kay Panabaker is a wonderful actress and the others in the cast were perfect.  The story of the sweet young girl who is a bit of an outcast, and her horse was sentimental.  The only flaw was ""Dante"" played perfectly by Don Johnson, who broods about but we never find out why he's so crabby.  Other than that which was minor, you will love ""Moondance"".",1216857600,4,591,4.634615384615385
3091395,5,B0012KSUT0,"Moondance Alexander

This is a sweet, family-oriented, little movie.  If you or any members of your family love to watch a good, clean-cut, non-cussing, happy movie, then this is for you.  And, oh my gosh -- NO nudity!!!!!  WHAT?!!!!

Moondance is a young girl, living in Colorado.  Doesn't have too many friends, marches to the beat of a different drummer.  Has an excellent attitude even though her dad has passed and like previously mentioned, she is not Miss Popular.

Enter into her life a darling horse -- Checkers -- who is owned by Don Johnson.  Moondance and Checkers prove to be friends and you should see what life brings to them!!!!

This is a great family movie -- which are hard-pressed to find these days.  You do not have to be a horse lover to be rooting for Checkers all the way!  What a beautiful animal -- he is so cool he has THREE movie star horses playing him in the movie.

This movie is a tad predicatble, but is full of good vibes, drama, sentiment, and heart-warming situations.  There are classmates who treat Moondance badly, but this is a good lesson for the kids watching.  And for us older kids, Don Johnson is still VERY easy on the eyes.

Grab some kleenex and some popcorn and enjoy!  I highly recommend this movie for ANY age.

Thank you!

3091396,5,B0012KSUT0,"Moondance Alexander is a great film....very heart warming. It's very clean.....G rated. The writer took two misfits and their lives were changed, through love for a horse and belief in the trainer. Don Johnson was  perfect for the role of Donta. I would love to see more from Michael Damian.
I always look at the rating before I buy . This film is proof that great films can also be clean films.

3091399,2,B0012KSUT0,The movie tries way to hard to be supercute. It exists in a time and a place which simply does not exist. Old Mr. McClancy who runs the old time general store with the old timmy register and the 50's pinball machine in the corner is stock character #1. Let's face it any business that somewhat resembles the general store has long since been driven into the ground by Wall Mart. These teens exist only in movies made for adults to show teens how they should behave. I can't say that I hate this movie since it's just so forgettable. Two Stars.,1212019200,2,543,4.333333333333333

There is a line in the film when the character Dante, played by Don Johnson, says to Moondance something to the effect ""they pick on you (referring to the ""mean"" girls) because they're unsure of themselves."" My daughter immediately picked up on this truism as it effects her every day life. The other messages about finding the courage, perseverance, and faith in one's strengths are all foundational to a good family film like this. The music was terrific as was the photography.

Whoever trained Checkers did an amazing job. I've never seen a horse do some of those things. I can't say enough things about this movie. I am saddened that it wasn't shown nationwide.

I don't know of a kid who would persist at that misery past two or three rejections so neither of those things are in any sense likely or real. if you like horse movies, there are FAR better ones. spoiler alert: this is typical - sad teen girl finds horse, enters competition and wins first time and it changes her life. it's not worth the $3.99 download. save your money for another horse story like the long shot if amazon prime ever brings that one back. if you're simply looking for feel good and don't care about the possibilities of the events actually happening, then go ahead and get moondance.",1463529600,,844,4.487012987012987

3325802,4,B0012KSUT0,"A good ""feel-good"" movie.  I liked seeing some of the mistakes that the girl made when she first tried to ride the horse, though she's lucky she didn't get herself killed.  I have no doubt that there are plenty of Pintos and other breeds that can jump as well as the Thoroughbreds can.  I'm not entirely certain that winning that contest was the greatest self-esteem booster because you're setting yourself up for a huge disappointment when you do lose, but she did prove her point.  The writers did go overboard with the antagonist.  I went through some stuff similar at that age, but I don't ever remember the other girl(s) being that bad.  It would have been more believable if they'd toned down the comments, or left them out all together and just had the antagonist ignore the MC.  Still, a decent movie for family entertainment.",1410307200,4,834,4.671232876712328

I really enjoyed this movie (again for the story), and I felt it was worth the time spent watching it. I'm a fan of Don Johnson, and he's his usual charming (even if sometimes gruff) self. I thought Panabaker did a great job in role. She made me smile all the time because of her character's spunk and optimism, and she's a good crier (not something a lot of young actors can pull off). The horse is beautiful, and I cheered them both on during the competition (watch to know what I mean). I plan to share this with my niece because I think she'll enjoy it, and it's a good, clean show I can feel comfortable recommending.",1392681600,2,738,4.271428571428571

There is one part where a young man mentions that his mother ""ran away to Miami with her boyfriend""... you will have warning when the part is near, though. Other than that, an awesome movie that I highly recommend for anyone, whether you are a horse lover or not. It's totally innocent and one that you will want to watch over and over.",1375920000,2,511,4.389473684210526

3325852,4,B0012KSUT0,"My feelings concerning horse adventure/competition movies is that most of them are essentially the same.  This movie certainly doesn't stand out among the genre.  A girl stumbles across a horse, falls in love with it and wants to raise it, and eventually partakes in a competition at the end.  Rinse and repeat.  Of course it's easy for me to say these type of horse films are all the same since I have no personal experience owning and raising horses, and therefore my feelings may very well be different from someone who's been raising and caring for them for years.  Sort of like how dog owners can't relate to dog haters... but less drastic, hehe.

Anyway, Moondance Alexander is a really well-written and well made movie about a girl that immediately shows an incredible amount of affection for a horse that happens to jump out in front of her bike while travelling down a back road one day, that she searches for the owner of the horse.  This man happens to look remarkably similar to WWF wrestler Bret Hart (have you SEEN him lately?  He looks just like *this* guy!) so... as you can probably guess, she does everything she possibly can for the horse until the inevitable competition takes place.  Of course she has arrogant and sassy classmates who think THEY have the winning horse.  We've seen the same storyline so many times.  These classmates are of course, the bad guys that wanna see her fail so they can laugh and mock her.  You know where this is going, trust me.

One thing I can't fault is the presentation.  This movie looks REALLY good.  The writing may be predictable but the way the scenery looks and the many segments showing the girl taking care of the horse look absolutely astonishing.  Great job there.  Also, maybe it's just a really big coincidence, but the girl playing this role (Kay Panabaker) looks identical to a few horse caretakers that I know.  Interesting there.  This means she's *perfect* for the role.  Also, a slight similarity to Judy Garland isn't out of the question either.  They both have a way of lighting up the screen when they smile.

My only complaint (other than the predictable writing) is that the actual competition that takes place at the end is based around horse jumps instead of an actual horse race, which means it's not a very dramatic or thrilling (or fitting) conclusion.  Instead it's lacking.  Other than this, it's all the same thing you've seen plenty of times before so you can take or leave this one.",1360800000,,2471,4.679814385150812

But this film, Moondance Alexander, is also outstanding in it's own way, as a family film aimed at families that include at least one member (probably a young girl) who loves horses. For that audience, this is a great movie.  It is a real thrill when the lovely, but socially shunned young teenager, Moondance, encounters her equine friend ""Checkers"" for the first time.  The horse is striking and unusual--a Pinto, (actually American Paint) who, like Moondance,  is something special, but not always immediately appreciated.

If you've already seen ""Black Beauty,"" ""National Velvet"" or ""My Friend Flicka,"" you might want to take a pass on ""Moondance Alexander,"" a wan girl-and-her-horse saga that doesn't even have the energy or conviction to rise above its own clichs.

Moondance is a ninth-grade social outcast who finds meaning and purpose in life when she spends the summer taking care of and learning to ride a horse owned by a cantankerous but lovable Pygmalion played by Don Johnson (think of it as an equine version of ""My Fair Lady,"" minus the songs and quality).  The first credibility obstacle we have to overcome is accepting the spunky and attractive Moondance as a girl who can't find herself a single friend (well, the two-legged type anyway).

The paint-by-numbers screenplay comes replete with a miraculous horse healing, a bevy of Valley Girl elitists straight out of Central Casting, and a horse-jumping competition that has all the drama and suspense of a Tiddlywinks tournament in Oshkosh.

Ah well, at least the movie boasts, in the person of Kay Panabaker, a young actress with a great deal of charm and potential.  And, besides, where else are you going to hear a line like, ""Moondance, I want you to take Checkers over to the stables,"" if not in this film?

This horse story (Checkers, a pinto this time) is like most horse stories. You gotta believe the horse will achieve success. Even with the typical super-horse ending, the story is a pleasant diversion into horse and stable life. Perhaps every young girl wishes to have a ""Checkers"" of their own. If they don't, this pleasant movie will give it to them.  But, this story is actually more about Moondance, the rider, than the horse.  And she's just as loveable.

This warm movie demonstrates perseverance as well as the lesson that everyone deserves a chance, and even a second chance.  Lots of second chances given in this movie. It's always rewarding when something of this quality comes from the inspiration of a true story.

3325885,3,B0012KSUT0,"""Saddle Club"" meets ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" and ""Bratz"", as the prettiest friendless teenage girl in cinema history goes up against her ""Queen Bee"" nemesis in a local equestrian competition. Throw in a little ""Pollyanna"" here for good measure as the friendless girl manages to inspire the adults in her town to lead better lives.

Kay Panabaker plays the friendless girl (Moondance Alexander), and Kay is so pretty she makes figure skater turned aspiring actress Sasha Cohen look rather plain by comparison. And Kay is a polished enough actress with enough effortless charm to almost make this film work. Unfortunately she is saddled (pun intended) with one of the worst written scripts you are likely to ever encounter.

The best scenes are those where Panabaker is alone on the screen and the worst are those involving her teenage rivals-the dialog given to these inexperienced cast members is almost surreal in its staggering lameness.

The film is at least one back-story too many as there just isn't time to adequately cover Moondance coping with her father's death, reconciling her mother's new romantic interest, getting flirty with the son of her mother's boyfriend, saving stable owner Donte (Don Johnson) from a wasted life of alcohol abuse, turning her horse Checkers into a competitive jumper, and giving Roscoe P. Coltraine (James Best) a few moments of mild comic relief.

""Moondance Alexander's"" target audience of preteen girls and Sasha Cohen fans wasn't enough for it to get a widespread theatrical release but it is available as a direct-to-DVD product. There is nothing original or exciting here but it is a pleasant enough family film. And the dare to be different theme is handled quite nicely.

This is a sweet, family-oriented, little movie.  If you or any members of your family love to watch a good, clean-cut, non-cussing, happy movie, then this is for you.  And, oh my gosh -- NO nudity!!!!!  WHAT?!!!!

Moondance is a young girl, living in Colorado.  Doesn't have too many friends, marches to the beat of a different drummer.  Has an excellent attitude even though her dad has passed and like previously mentioned, she is not Miss Popular.

Enter into her life a darling horse -- Checkers -- who is owned by Don Johnson.  Moondance and Checkers prove to be friends and you should see what life brings to them!!!!

This is a great family movie -- which are hard-pressed to find these days.  You do not have to be a horse lover to be rooting for Checkers all the way!  What a beautiful animal -- he is so cool he has THREE movie star horses playing him in the movie.

This movie is a tad predicatble, but is full of good vibes, drama, sentiment, and heart-warming situations.  There are classmates who treat Moondance badly, but this is a good lesson for the kids watching.  And for us older kids, Don Johnson is still VERY easy on the eyes.

Grab some kleenex and some popcorn and enjoy!  I highly recommend this movie for ANY age.

I was glad to share the honest sense of this girl and her experiences with my kids...so many good moments. This is a must have for family viewing. I would recommend it highly.  (by the way, we had boys and girls, one lap sitter on up to a 14 year old girl, all with smiles)",1206057600,19,491,3.95959595959596
3325922,4,B0012KSUT0,"I got to see this movie during its premiere weekend in Salt Lake City.  At first I didn't think I would like it since I'm not really into the traditional ""horse"" movie.  Much to my surprise the wonderfully-written story deals much more with the relationships of the characters in the story.  I thought the performances by Kay Panabaker, Don Johnson and Lori Laughlin were fantastic, believable and relevant.  The best thing is that it is a movie that the entire family will enjoy, including the parents!!!
Another note: I agree with past reviewers on the photography, it is fantastically done.  I also think the soundtrack is brilliant, featuring some wonderful vocalists doing some great songs.",1205971200,43,695,5.008695652173913
3325923,5,B0012KSUT0,"I really liked Moondance Alexander, I saw it at the L.A. Femme International Film Festival in Beverly Hills.  In fact, I can't wait for it to come out so I can give it to my niece!  She loves horses.  But most of all, the content is so heartwarming.  The mother and daughter are a great example for today's kids and the way Moondance is so focused outshines the examples we see on TV.  Thanks for making a positive, clean, uplifting movie!",1205971200,8,439,4.37037037037037
8246553,4,B0012KSUT0,"If you're in the mood for a lighthearted horse based story, this is good. I watched this w/ my parents and we all liked it. Definitely keeps your attention enough for a watch. I'd watch it again sometime in the future.",1526774400,,218,4.341463414634147

8246558,5,B0012KSUT0,This is a great family movie.  I could watch a Don Johnson movie everyday.  Why isn't he in more movies?!,1519171200,,105,4.2
8246559,4,B0012KSUT0,"Based on an endearing inspiring true story lovingly produced by that grown-up horse-loving awkward young teen & her later hubby, this is a fresh, natural, uplifting, all-age family tale of an appealing teen like a female Mark Twain but a good example of embracing effort & achieving a dream, her single mother played by a familiar actress, and the man who got another shot in life (not a romance) by likeably matured famous actor Don Johnson.

This refreshingly G-rated yet realistic summer tale spares us vulgarity, obscenity, blood, violence, horror. It includes the example of a non-inebriated man putting away a bottle of alcohol temptation. The Biblically-warned vegetarianism of the loving mother in the arts is sensibly and not obnoxiously protested by the practical young girl. Everyone is fully dressed, and no mouth-kissing of actors by other actors.",1518220800,,860,5.231884057971015

8246562,5,B0012KSUT0,"One of my favorite movies. If you are a horse addict like me, just buy it and save yourself having to look for it later. Typical fare but a good story none the less. Well acted for the most part and something you can watch with the kids without worrying about language, sex or violence.",1510358400,,286,4.218181818181818
