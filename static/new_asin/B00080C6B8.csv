2255233,5,B00080C6B8,"I have most of the Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVDs and have been doing them now for a couple of weeks, with effective results. The ""saddle-bags"" are disappearing and it has been fun making it happen.

It's much easier to be consistent when you enjoy both the challenge and the scenery. You can take your exercise to whatever level you want with these. Those of us who are not experts in cycling don't have to worry. We don't get left behind in the dust and we get just as much exercise value as those with lots of experience and expertise. Nobody is judging us on our form or speed.

The European Sampler appears to have been their first DVD. It's a few minutes shorter than the others I've been doing, maybe by about 10 minutes. Regardless, it is PACKED with beautiful and challenging areas to explore. I think of it as an adventure. Every day I look forward to going somewhere new, or, sometimes, a place I have been and enjoy riding through on my virtual bike, seeing it from a different viewpoint.

These cycling DVDs are the best exercise discovery I've made for a very long time. I wish I had discovered them earlier.",1267833600,2,1118,4.497536945812808
2255234,4,B00080C6B8,I like using this when I train on indoors on my bike.  It breaks up the same old news or Ipod music.,1263168000,,100,3.5454545454545454
2255235,4,B00080C6B8,"I really enjoyed the Bike-O-Vision. It is exactly what I expected. In terms of quality, the product is solid. The music is nice, but I put in my earphones and crank out an hour or so. The value is not great - the clips are very short - I thought I might get about 2 hours of footage from this product. I have St. Croix and I'm planning on buying more of these - they will keep me busy on the bike through these long winters.

I'd like to see a company do the same thing with CGI and sell them for significantly less (= more value).",1233619200,,531,3.9626168224299065
2255236,5,B00080C6B8,"This is a great way to tour different parts of Europe and have fun indoor cycling at the same time.  All of the Bike-O-Vision DVDs are fantastic journeys and I am particulary fond of the Zion Nat Park & So. Utah, Nevada, Sedona, California Wine Country, and Puerto Rico adventures. I like to alternate these with the Spinerval (Troy Jacobson) DVDs, especially the Cycling with Iron Girl.",1232496000,6,387,4.776119402985074
2255237,3,B00080C6B8,"The site seeing is nice but it's pretty slow, and the music selection doesn't exactly motivate you.",1176163200,4,99,4.882352941176471
2255238,4,B00080C6B8,"What a perfect way to learn and see great travel footage while working out!  I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these, but I was pleasently surprised.  Basically it's just really nice footage of scenic driving and biking routes set to music.  I have a television right in front of my exercise bike, and I even watch it from the tread mill.  Keep 'em coming!",1173398400,6,366,4.417910447761194
8054968,1,B00080C6B8,"This purchase seemed like a good idea at the time. You know -- winter, stationary bicycle. I was interested in a DVD that would simulate cycling through Europe as realistically as possible. Aside from being too brief, the music simply didn't fit the tempo of the cycling, the speed is (as another reviewer also mentioned) car speed, and the jump cuts to the villages were jarring. Disappointing. I think I'll stick to real bicycling in good weather, with real views.",1438041600,,466,4.8375
8054969,4,B00080C6B8,"It would be better if they had used bike speed, not car speed. Nice scenery and music, enjoyed the ride.",1395014400,,104,4.25
8054970,5,B00080C6B8,"Makes you think you are there. You don't get bored while cycling in your living room.
Get it, you won't be sorry.",1369353600,,113,4.181818181818182
8054971,1,B00080C6B8,"I've cycled throughout Europe and bought this DVD to bring back memories of all the beautiful villages I've been through.  Although the scenery is good,  it's a very bad choice of music!  I don't think I can watch this again unless I'm reading a book or cleaning while it is playing!",1361577600,,283,4.509803921568627
8054972,5,B00080C6B8,"This video was amazing! This video brought back many memories of my trip to Italy. I was so intrigued by the many different sites and how smooth the video was that it felt like I was actually there. I absolutely enjoyed the scenery on the Rhine River and the rush of cycling through Austria. I have never been one to enjoy exercising and I lose motivation rather quickly, but thanks to Bike-O-Vision I look forward to exercising daily.",1343174400,,435,4.589743589743589
8054973,1,B00080C6B8,"This DVD looks like 35 minutes (is that all???) of stock footage of European countryside set to generic classical music.  I bought this expecting a pseudo visual riding experience while I worked out on my indoor trainer.  I expected some climbs, some flats, some downhills and a true road experience.  You drive(ride) along roads for several segments.  This is all well and good but for the last 10 minutes, you just get scenes of the various sights in various parts of different European cities (Frieburg, Strasbourg,etc).  The fact that is was so short and really didn't contain much ""meat"" was very disappointing.  I feel like I wasted my money.",1334534400,,648,4.89908256880734
8054974,1,B00080C6B8,"If you want the time you spend on your stationary bike to be especially tedious, this is the CD for you. This ""ride"" consists of the following: a close, unwavering focus on a gray, paved road(camera must be mounted on the hood of a car)that travels through undefined, uninteresting landscape (a glimpse at a mountain or river occurs randomly and quickly), broken only by an occasional and quickly passed road sign, almost no buildings, hardly any cars, no other bikes, a flash of a pedestrian from time to time. After about 5 minutes, the camera makes a pan toward a distant village for about 5 seconds and then it's back to the road.  To make matters worse, the contrast and brightness have been adjusted luridly (there is also digital break-up), and selected segments from the best loved classical music are played over and over. I had bought this and others in the Bike-o-vision series (which I now dread to sample) to be entertaining background for biking during therapy and recovery from a knee injury...horrors.",1325635200,,1017,4.844827586206897
8054975,4,B00080C6B8,"This video was well done - a nice sample of several countries and roads.  The scenery was beautiful and the music chosen well - although I might have added a bit of yodelling to the alps, and a Tarentella to Italy.  I have already made room in my daypack for a baquette, cheese and some wine!!",1301961600,,293,4.214285714285714
8054976,3,B00080C6B8,"This was an excellent sampler of the European videos available from Bike-O-Vision, but I feel a little ripped off.

It's only 30 minutes or so long. It really should have been much longer.",1290384000,,188,4.696969696969697
8054977,1,B00080C6B8,"I enjoyed the other Bike-O-Vision projects very much but this presentation is so short, under twenty minutes. It was not very appropriate for indoor cycling training.",1274054400,4,166,5.423076923076923
