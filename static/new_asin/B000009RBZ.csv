7905626,5,B000009RBZ,"I really like this movie but unfortunately the DVD is cut, missing all the gore in the killing scenes. The VHS also from Troma is the only version that seems to be uncut that I've found. Never the less, great b movie from your friends at Troma",1450137600,2,243,4.191489361702128

7905628,2,B000009RBZ,"""Girls Schools Screamers"" is the only film directed by John P. Finegan and I think the number of cast members whose images were actually ever seen on celluloid ever again can be counted on one hand.  The plot has seven beautiful coeds at an exclusive finishing school spending the night locked in a dark mansion where they are ""finished"" off, one by one (the original tag line for the film was ""The Finishing School That Finished Them Off!"" which is actually better than the other one, which is ""How Much Gut Wrenching Fright Can You Stand?"").  You have probably already notice the big spoiler about this film (it has no nudity and little gore, but no nudity), but for me the jaw dropper was the ""rationale"" behind the blood bath, which we get from the opening tale of days gone bye, because when it comes to vengeance from beyond the grave I have to think that ""kissing"" is a relatively minor sign.  Once the killing begins the question is whether the smart girls can figure it out before they become the next victims.  No fair rooting for the killer.  The Australian version of ""Girls School Screamers"" runs two minutes longer and while there may well be those who would want a director's cut version to be available on future DVDs, I am not one of them.  I was surprised that this is a Troma film because it is simply the least Troma-like Troma film I have ever seen.  The DVD has the theatrical trailer, productions stills, and the usual Troma Studio tour, Troma intelligence test, and some scenes from Troma's Edge TV show.  Still, at some point you are going to have to actually watch ""Girl School Screamers.""  Bet you fall asleep before they get to the parts you might actually want to watch.  Why does this film get 2 stars?  Because single stars are reserved for snuff films.",1036108800,3,1784,4.561128526645768
7905629,3,B000009RBZ,Well. What can I say? This movie doesn't have enough senseless nudity to be called 'Girl School Screamers'. That would be like a movie called 'Womens Prison Screamers' with no shower scenes. That's it...I'm callin the mayor.,1026950400,11,224,5.081081081081081
7905630,1,B000009RBZ,I like troma films quite a bit and was very disappointed in this.  You'd think with a name with 'GIRLS' and 'SCREAMERS' in it there would be some naughty skin.  There was more nudity in Disney's Aladin.  Skip it Troma  Fans!,954288000,16,224,4.390243902439025
7905631,3,B000009RBZ,First of this is a TROMA film. And TROMA rules the indie horror industry. This film was done in 86 and what stood out the most was much of the film had little gore. Proving once again you don't need gore to make a good  horror film. The suspense in this film is A.O.K. and is a neat little  midnight flick.,951782400,4,306,4.0
