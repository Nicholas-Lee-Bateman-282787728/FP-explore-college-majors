5680504,5,B00BX8A918,"Yes, it filled all my expectation.  The movie plays well....the only problem is that it took a long time to get here, but it was worth the wait.  We had a copy of this movie already, but it broke in the center of the disk and was hard to play, so we had to replace it.  We enjoy this movie!!",1402617600,7,291,3.816666666666667

5680506,5,B00BX8A918,"Without trying to go in depth-knowing what critics wrote long ago-I can only say this movie epitomizes the things I loved about Elvis movies in the 1960's...great/fun songs, a plausible plot and some good looking people carrying a movie for a couple of hours...works for me. This is one of my personal favorites for a song called: ""Hard Knocks""...and still good seeing a middle-aged Barbara Stanwyck doing her thing...",1373328000,9,418,5.072463768115942

5680510,5,B00BX8A918,"This Elvis movie was entertaining and interesting to watch. Yes I love when Elvis starts singing,playing the guitar and getting the Ladies attention. The story brings you back to the days of Carnivals and Elvis is there trying to make things work out for the owners who are not doing too well and Elvis makes a difference. I plan on watching Roustabout from time to time.",1467676800,,371,4.636363636363637

8575017,4,B00BX8A918,"This is one of Elvis's earlier films, in which there was a story to tell and plenty of action by both himself and the others in the film.  It is about two Carnivals and how he helped one to become solvent.  For anyone who doesn't know much about the workings of a Carnival, there are plenty of explanations  on the various areas of the trade, which is very interesting.  Of course, like all Elvis movies, he has his romances and gets the girl in the end.",1500508800,,454,4.244186046511628
