Adam & The Ants were way ahead of their time with this concert,i too would love to see it come to dvd.
It's like the tv series The Twilight Zone in that Serling was way far advanced than anyone of us were.
When you see the stage effects and hear the tribal drumming it to will get you.
This is one of my favorite rock concerts of all time and is really fun to watch.

CBS/FOX and MGM/Leo The Lion must have a lot of stuff in their film vaults.
It's time to bring all of it out of the vaults and sell it to those who want it.
C'mon you two,we want what you have locked away.
By the time these two studios release everything out of their vaults a bunch of us will be dead and gone by then.
I hope i'm wrong about that but there is a market for the stuff they have hidden away.
I highly recommend this concert and hope soon that it comes out on dvd.
Studios are you listening?",1360195200,,1359,4.0
8060153,5,B0009G2YS6,"This a stellar example of Adam Ant's earlier work. You can tell he works VERY hard to give value for your ticket price.  Extremely hard working and talented. The only downside is that this extravaganza was never available on DVD.  Would Love for that to become available and him get the proceeds. If your generation or the next ever wondered what music was about before the digital, 'crank-them out' age...work that stands the test of time, and what a great showman really is...Check out Adam in his various incarnations (several of them are included in this concert).  You'll become hooked very quickly no matter what your musical tastes; he has a truly unique style and something for everyone.",1303516800,2,695,4.872881355932203
8060154,4,B0009G2YS6,"This was the only commercially available concert from Adam and the Ants.
This time capsule captures Adam and the Ants at their peak. Sadly it is only on VHS and such a shame too.
The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is that they do not perform ""Stand and Deliver"", which is too bad.
Definitely worth getting if it's available any time soon.",1296604800,,340,4.166666666666667
8060155,5,B0009G2YS6,"I remember seeing this concert aired on MTV for the first time and was blown away.  I knew nothing about Adam and/or the Ants or their music.  My brother and I were transfixed by this show.  That was the early 80's.  I also saw Adam Ant two nights in a row in Atlanta in '84 and once in LA in '85 (the '85 show was OK).

25 years later I procured a copy of this concert (VHS copied to DVD).  I was pleasantly surprised to find the Prince Charming Revue still engrossing and fascinating.  Adam is an incredible performer.  The music is almost genre-free (other than 'post-punk') and extremely unique.  The band is tight and talented.  The vocals and harmonies (aided by off-stage singers) are fabulous.

Get past the 'Adam Ant' persona and you will be thrilled by the show.  Honestly, I do not like the studio work of Adam and the Ants (low-tech, average quality), but to see them live back in their day is sheer delight.",1242172800,3,920,4.410714285714286
8060156,5,B0009G2YS6,"This is an absolutely not to be missed experience for any Adam Ant fan! My dad and step-mom had to special order this tape from a dealer in New York, they gave $99.00 for it back in 1991, when I was at the height of my Ant obsession. I was 18, and had never witnessed anything better! He is a genius, one of the most underrated musicians EVER! The colors, even on VHS, are bright and vivid. It would be hard to say which of his persona's from the time are better - the Kings of the Wild Frontier, or the Dandy Highwayman? I love the Prince Charming outfit the best! ""Any more for the Christian Dior?!"" Buy this and pray the crazies in charge of what gets released on DVD realize THERE IS A MARKET FOR ADAM ANT!! Just because they don't get his tongue in cheek brilliance doesn't mean the rest of us are as clueless! Long Live the Ant Man!!",1229644800,5,839,4.153374233128834
8060157,5,B0009G2YS6,The way this production was put togeher is great.  Heaven knows what the sets must have cost!  I have watched it three times since purchasing it.,1211932800,2,145,4.538461538461538
8060158,5,B0009G2YS6,"Occasionally a band emerges in live performance in a way that's never captured in the studio. I recall thinking at the time that this little eddy of style might well lead the way for other musicians--but it didn't happen. Adam's foray remains unique and brilliant but where he led no one else could follow. If you didn't see the band perform live or at least hear this taped performance (or another from the era), you know nothing, repeat nothing, about Adam Ant.",1203292800,3,463,4.658536585365853
8060159,5,B0009G2YS6,"adam and the ants prince charming review .when you look at the box its basically a concert film at first glance.then you pop the vhs tape in and hopefully its been well preserved as my own copy plays as clear as any dvd and is mint.by the time the band takes the stage you relize that this is no ordinary concert,it is borderline a theatracle spectacle??a play with different acts??in 1981-82 this was unheard of.while other bands like loverboy,rush and the van halens of the world spent undisclosed amounts of money for some pyrotechniches and (wow)lasor lighting,not to mention a ten minute guitar solo and a 15 minute drum solo by every band. adam and his tribe put on a show that was still the traditional concert with all the live music,live vocals,dual drums that the arena bands of the day presented but his stage theatrics were light years ahead of its time.sean p.diddy combs was still in diapers when the bold adam ant broke ground and turned his stage into a 17th century spanish gallion.or a ancient norman castle.or drifting through the plains of western north america with its native american look and the pulsating tribal beats.

working off the material of his first three lp's dirk wears white sox,kings of the wild fronier and prince charming adam and the ants were at the very top of there game.and although i have seen him many times since the prince charming review,nothing at that time was so bold in regards to a live rock n roll concert.i don't even think he knew the impact that this one show or tour would have on the music scene forever.even creative genious minds like david bowie fed off the prince charming review with his glass spider tour,and so many after him.

this vhs is adam and the ants at there very best and also is a milestone of taking a rock n roll concert and mixing it with theatrics in a tasteful way and combining the two for a spellbinding show.this is the way i shall forever remember marco,merrick,terry lee,gary tibbs and his truly adam ant(stuart goddard).kings of the wild frontier..forever
