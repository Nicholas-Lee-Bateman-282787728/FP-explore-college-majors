8638021,5,B00BKQPFR6,I have always wanted to make my own quilt and have purchased several books but it never turns out the same. This DVD actually helps me to get it done right! I love how I can use these squares and make my quilt as simple or as intricate as I want. It's just what I need.,1362873600,,269,3.8214285714285716
8638022,5,B00BKQPFR6,Most helpful Video instructions I ever used for anything. I am very pleased with this video I was able to make my granddaughter a beautiful quilt. Thank you Karen Dennison,1362009600,,171,4.733333333333333
8638023,5,B00BKQPFR6,"Watching the video and going through the steps with Karen made quilting a lot easier than I had expected. With my new found knowledge from this video, I should be able to complete some quilts for Christmas presents. The $27 was well worth the savings from the presents I can now make. The steps were easy to follow. I could pause between each step and compare, so I didn't feel lost. I am so excited about this new talent that I have acquired. I'v made quilts below, but they always turned out looking like a school project and not a good quality quilt. This video helps you to make quilts worthy of a first place award in a quilt show. Thank you Karen for my new talent. Kay Dee Strebe",1361836800,,686,4.2846153846153845
8638024,5,B00BKQPFR6,"This video was amazing. I  feel like I learned so much by watching this video. I feel like I could do a number of quilts,in various different ways. I have never been a very crafty person, but this video made everyhing seem easy. The price is unbeatable. With a video the best part is pausing and rewinding, instead of paying more to get into a class, and gettig left behind during inrtuction,that just makes it a waste of money and time. With this I can impress my friends with my knowledge,or like I am planing next week a girls craft night, where we can make quilts,and have fun at our own house.",1361836800,,598,4.339285714285714
