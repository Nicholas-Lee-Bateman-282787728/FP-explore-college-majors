7485927,1,B0170LT4P8,"This movie is flat out terrible. I don't leave many reviews unless I have a very strong opinion on it (good or bad). Unfortunately this one is BAAADDDD. The acting is terrible!!! I thought it'd be good as I didn't read the Amazon reviews before I watched it, and I saw the IMDB score was 7.1 which I felt was good...

*********SPOILER ALERT*****

So the premise of this film is of an amateur TV reporter assigned to her first case, a school shooting. She felt a ""connection"" to the shooting because she went to the school? Okay. She starts getting haunted by a ""ring"" type girl and weird clues start popping up. She feels compelled to investigate. On the initial interview the TV station sets her up with a new transfer camera guy.

We see some flashbacks and some clues come into play, and eventually the reporter gets an address and goes to the place IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT! She spies on the place, and of course the creepy white pickup truck that was present during a murder in the opening scene is there.  The truck passes by her while she was hiding in her car but doesn't notice her. Moments later the truck comes back and goes and gets a body wrapped in white sheets.....Wait WTF, this guy was going to dump a body but forgot the damn body when he left his house??

So the next day this genius girl decides to go BACK to this house. She runs into a skull in the yard but decides it's a good idea to break in and....I don't know confront the machete wielding psycho? Oh yes, so her father is a cop who was investigating the case (evidence pointed that the killer went to Mexico). So there are clues to who the killer is and she has a flashback and it was a kid who was bullied and liked her when she was growing up. He then comes home, and she hides in the closet and he grabs his machete.

Her cop dad shows up ALONE (I guess to follow up on a lead to the school shooting massacre who killed 8 kids)...yes ALONE in the middle of the night and throws a rock threw the window to distract the killer as he was about to open the closet she was hiding. We don't see it but hear ""Freeze get on the ground"" and a struggle ensues and the father is stabbed. The girl confronts the killer as she knows who he is. He ended up being the chill camera man.

After a struggle she stabs him and then backup arrives and he's gone!! He limped away and the cops can't find him and he's just walking in the street. A lady hits him by accident and gets all scared and calls the police. She turns around and he's gone. WTF?",1484179200,5,2512,4.188405797101449
7485928,4,B0170LT4P8,"it was a good movie,,definitely not a horror...somebody thinks it is..I do have to say the ghost thing was the best thing about the movie..Horror movies don't have to have a killer..just ghosts,house,family,demons,a big fight between good and evil..
 and that is all..no gore , no one is afraid of man anymore..its the supernatural stuff. :)",1484006400,2,341,5.089285714285714

7485933,4,B0170LT4P8,"I watched this film after reading the boasting review on Cryptic Rock (An official film review site: (...)
The film begins with the usual introduction of who's who. The suspense builds up nicely as the story progresses. There are a few unexpected scary jolts mixed in between some not-too-over-the-top killing scenes with a complimenting soundtrack and sound effects. A dark movie but I suppose that's expected with any horror. A unique incorporation of a slasher and supernatural movie in one. The film leaves you with a cliffhanger so it'll be interesting to see, if they make a sequel, how and where they pick it up.

*** THERE IS A SOUND ISSUE WITH THE DIGITAL VERSION. Watch it on DVD without any problems then Rate it.",1457308800,,724,4.792
7485934,1,B0170LT4P8,"Horrible film quality, very bad sound. Very boring, acting is decent.  Do not waste your money. Don't listen to the other reviews. This movie is so slow, makes zero sense, the sound quality and acting is horrible.  Seriously I couldn't even finish it that's how bad it was.",1457308800,2,273,4.666666666666667

8737745,1,B0170LT4P8,"The film starts out as a vigilante slasher which includes elementary school bullies. Tina, a wannabe reporter covers the story and the film shifts to ghost story as Tina sees apparitions.

The acting was not good. The plot line didn't work and was not well developed. They mixed horror genre didn't work.

8737746,1,B0170LT4P8,"Decent premise, but plot development hindered by poor acting.  The director should have demanded more.  This movie might have worked with better actors. The choice of actors was deplorable...perhaps the director had no choice, but you should have demanded more. Wooden acting will kill ANY attempt to make a serious horror movie. You literally could have gotten people off the street to act better than this.  Just my 2 cents worth...",1492128000,,434,5.084507042253521
8737747,5,B0170LT4P8,"Great movie! If you like horror, the supernatural, and suspense you have to see this film it has it all wrapped into one. I watched it alone in the dark and I loved the feeling of being scared. Must see!",1491350400,,203,4.1
8737748,1,B0170LT4P8,"This doesn't even deserve one star. The dumbest f*in movie I've ever seen in my life. No one can act. Whoever directed this movie....for the love of God, please, no more. Save your money and go to school for something you'd be better at. Instead of insulting my eyeballs.",1490572800,,271,4.551020408163265
8737749,1,B0170LT4P8,"This would probably be 1 & 1/2 stars, not the worst of the F- prime horror but the director has no clue what this movie is supposed to be and so consequently, neither do you. The premise of a school shooting just doesn't fit with the ""The Ring"" style girl apparition, you need something lonely and creepy for that. While tragic, school shootings aren't that. Then there is the low-budget fixation with everything its characters do, padding basically, so you're subjected all manner of unrelated stuff in these things (detailed trips to the grocery store for instance). This one fails to create any atmosphere (most don't) and they never really lift off from there. Completely fails to entertain, so... completely fails basically.",1490054400,,729,4.983606557377049
