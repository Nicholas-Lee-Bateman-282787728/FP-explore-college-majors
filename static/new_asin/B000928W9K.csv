The camera work, if you want to give it such a technical name, is in constant bouncing, unfocused, or swerving motion. I lost count of how many times I had to look away due to nausea - and I have never been afflicted with motion sickness!  The first 15 minutes is an absurd (and utterly boring) recitation and display of the types of cannabis and hashish offered in one of Amsterdam's coffee houses, presented as if that's the only reason to visit this city.  Even if you wanted to, you can't hear a thing over the background music and the picture is so bad that if there is a purpose for this segment, you'd never know it.  The rest of it follows suit: a Transportation section with absolutely zero practical information and an odd and lengthy fascination with bicycle traffic; a Dining section where the only coverage is his claim that food distributed by a vending machine across from McDonalds is what you should consume late at night; the Red Light District is reduced to an interview with a woman who recites all the different types of establishments in which sex is for sale.  Need I say more?  Waste of time. Waste of money. The entire production is an embarrassing, amateur attempt at what barely qualifies as a crudely made vacation video.  I'm hoping Amazon will take this one back and refuse to sell it in the future.",1176508800,,1471,4.507518796992481
