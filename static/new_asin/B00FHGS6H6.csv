5992976,5,B00FHGS6H6,"excellent as always!  they always do such a good job and handle the shows so well especially for their ages.  I have had the pleasure of attending a concert, if you have not I would highly recommend it.",1384646400,7,202,4.2894736842105265
5992977,5,B00FHGS6H6,"A lovely DVD! Fantastic songs, amazing sung by Libera. Stunning beautiful! You have not heared something like this before!
If you don't have a christmas present by now, don't hesitate to by it. You will not regret it - I promise!",1384387200,10,229,4.609756097560975
5992978,5,B00FHGS6H6,"The wait is over. After a little over six years, Libera just released their new DVD. This time it is a recording of mostly Christmas music. Last summer (August 8 & 9, 2013) the group traveled to St. Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh, Northern Ireland to record the DVD in live performances so it could be released in time for the holidays. There is evidence that portions of the recording will also appear in the US on PBS television with Josh Madine as the guest ""commentator.""

Two years ago in August, I attended a Libera concert near Dallas, Texas. The lighting etc. on the new DVD reminds me more of that concert than the old DVD. As with the Texas concert, some of the older boys provide the lower parts of the music. This adds to the depth of the Libera sound with the younger boys providing the traditional Libera, ""Angel Voices"" experience. The large cathedral environment is the natural environment for Libera. St. Patrick's has a large, mostly open ""stage"" area that works very well with the way Libera performs concerts and with the requirements to make a good video production. The cathedral was specifically decorated in a Christmas fashion, with what one of the choir boys described as one of the most ""humongous"" Christmas trees he'd ever seen. While the fronts of the boys were consistently in white light, the background was lit with a variety of colors and patterns. The acoustics of the room served very well with a nice, smooth sound decay time. The audio on the DVD is available as both two channel and DTS 5.1 surround. If you have the ability to do surround sound, I would highly recommend choosing that option from the setup menu. That really gives the ""live performance"" feel.

The DVD contains many of the same songs and arrangements as found on the Libera Christmas CD of a couple years ago; however, it is very apparent that these are new recordings - not just lip-syncs of the old CD. There are a few additions with an Irish flavor. One is the ""Wexford Carol,"" and another is ""Danny Boy."" While there are many fine performances, I need to call special attention to ""Danny Boy."" This was done acappella with Isaac London singing the solo. He handles this demanding assignment extremely well. Also, there was an Irish influence in the instrumentation such as Irish drum and flute lines on many songs.

I am very glad to be able to add this DVD (along with the audio CD recorded at the same time) to my library of Libera music. If you are a Libera fan, you should be very happy with the new DVD. If you've never heard them before, this is your chance to experience what I think is one of the finest boy choirs in the world. It would make a nice Christmas present, but please give it ahead of time so that it can be a special addition to your celebration.

As always I am very pleased with this new recording from Libera. My only hope is that they might be able to release a version of the DVD on Blu-ray. While the video is in 16:9 anamorphic format, it is not ""high definition."" As ""standard definition"" DVD's go, this is very well done; but true ""high definition"" (720P or 1080P) would improve the experience - particularly in home theater systems with large screens.",1383782400,28,3192,4.56544502617801
5992979,5,B00FHGS6H6,"Beautiful quality. The picture and sound are great and there are a few extras too (3 bonus songs, a behind the scenes clip, and Libera kids talking about Christmas). As for the concert itself, the music is phenomenal. Robert Prizeman's arrangements as usual are beautiful and perfect for the voices. The boys sing like angels as always.

5992983,3,B00FHGS6H6,"This album is beautiful, as I expected.  However, there was a periodic annoying skip.
The supplier was very accommodating, replacing it with another copy, even though
it was well after the time for requesting a replacement.  Unfortunately, the second
copy had the same skipping problem.  I decided not to pursue the issue any further.
I felt that the supplier had already been very accommodating by sending the second
copy and it appeared that the skip was in all the copies that the manufacturer had
made.",1427673600,,506,4.929411764705883

When we couldn't find that it was coming on TV again, I ordered 3 of these, one for my family and one each for our parents (both couples in their early 80s).  This is a very enjoyable DVD, and Libera's performance has become a staple of our Christmas season.",1420761600,,399,4.378378378378378

I was captivated untill the very end--it was HEAVENLY PEACE! I did not want it to end--but,of course, it had to--so I just had to order the DVD along with the CD! I hope to start a Christmas tradition and bring heavenly peace to my Christmas seasons from now on!",1398556800,,494,4.689655172413793

5993009,5,B00FHGS6H6,"What a harmony!!! Many thousands years ago, the angels came to the Earth and did many things; one was sing, remember, the born of JESUS,, it was written. Now, with this boys choir LIBERA (in latin=freedom), again we have a group of angels singing, but this time the angels will stay with us for many years. Every woman and man on the planet should have the opportunity to hear this angels singing only once in a lifetime. You can't hear samples in the dvd, but in the cd you can. I bought this dvd expecting that it was one more boys choir;  NO, it is the CHOIR. Maybe, if you die without hearing and viewing this angels, your life was incomplete; I think this of my self. Thanks God I got it and I got my liberation too. Don't hesitate to buy this precious jewel,  that of course, if you like good music and have the ear to listen to it. Haring and listening this Choir is the most nearest your are going to be from heaven before you die.",1397952000,,939,4.211111111111111

Yes!!  And this holiday recording proves it.  Good job, as always, boys!

Highly recommended!!",1394496000,,196,5.225806451612903
5993011,5,B00FHGS6H6,"This Christmas performance is a sensory explosion of wonderful sights and sounds that will take you to another time and place.

The quality of the performance is right up there with other greats like Kings College Choir. The chorister's voices are angelic, to say the least. But what is more, the close-ups of the choristers show a child-like innocence and purity that I haven't seen anywhere in years and years. You see beautiful young people who actually open their mouths and enunciate and smile and look like they mean what they are singing; it's remarkable !

The children their age that I see in my neighborhood are just all small adults full of anger and cynicism and incapable of joy or happiness. But these young choristers simply radiated joy and peace; happiness and innocence. As I watched them and listened to them, I somehow felt that maybe there is hope for the world after all.",1394150400,,893,4.754838709677419
5993012,5,B00FHGS6H6,This was an outstanding performance. The boys' voices were almost angelic and the musical accompaniment was lovely. The simple settings were perfect.,1393027200,,149,5.818181818181818

5993017,5,B00FHGS6H6,"When they called these boys Angel Voices, there was a very good reason.  Never get tired of listening to Libera.  Would love to see them in person but this dvd is the next best thing as it puts the viewer right there, even closer than front row seats.  Highly recommended!",1391644800,,272,4.4
5993018,5,B00FHGS6H6,I am passionate about Christmas. I have a few Christmas DVDs and I must say this concert really rounds it off for me. If you can listen to this concert in 5.1 surround -it's almost like being there!,1391472000,,198,4.2368421052631575
5993019,5,B00FHGS6H6,"If you want a relaxing, uplifting Christmas concert DVD, I recommend this one. I saw part of this performance on PBS before Christmas. My husband and I visited this cathedral on our honeymoon, and some of my mother-in-law's ancestors came from Armagh, so this was a perfect gift for her, and for the three of us to share. After the rest of the family went their separate ways on Christmas Eve, my mother-in-law put the DVD in and we sat back to listen and watch. Libera's voices are flawless, and the kids who speak and have solos are so engaging. The music and the cathedral are incredibly gorgeous. Sound and picture quality on this DVD are first rate. All three of us loved it, and my mother-in-law commented it would make a great Christmas tradition to play every year. Can't ask for a better gift review than that!",1391212800,,819,4.54054054054054

5993025,5,B00FHGS6H6,"I saw this performance on a National Public Television fundraiser and was extremely impressed by these children and their fabulous voices.  I had to have this DVD and have now played it numerous times and never get tired of hearing and seeing them perform.
They all are great but Michael has the most amazing voice (you hear him numerous times above all others) with his high range.
These children are an absolute delight and I highly recommend this DVD for your enjoyment for years to come.

5993036,5,B00FHGS6H6,"They begin with Joy to the World and end with Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, with lots of enjoyable music inbetween. Personally I like their last DVD, Angel Voices: Libera in Concert, better (because of the song choices).
This DVD will NOT disappoint. Libera filmed this in the Summer of 2013, and they have not sounded better. If you like Christmas music, this is the DVD to buy, they rock out on every song, giving their all. *Also consider buying the Christmas CD they released a couple of years ago. Visit: libera.org.uk (Libera's official website) choose the SHOP tab, and you will be given a choice between which worldwide Amazon.com store to visit. Choose the American Flag, and that directs you to Libera's Amazon store. Buying Libera's music this way, through their website, still gives Amazon their money, and at the same time gives Libera a percentage of the sales; this goes towards supporting them practicing, recording and touring.

5993040,5,B00FHGS6H6,"Libera once again excels in entertaining audiences all over the world, but this recording manages to show them up close and personal in a way that makes us all proud of their many accomplishments.  As a high school choral director, I know all too well how music directly influences young people's lives to want to excel beyond their wildest dreams.  Here in this DVD we have proof of that, and so much credit goes to Robert Prizeman and his staff for creating an atmosphere for these young boys that allows them to show us what young talent can achieve.  This is a DVD well thought out, and given great attention to detail in visually capturing the work and dedication put into a very proud team of young people who TRULY give us an amazing array of the many Christmas timely classics we've come to love all over the world.  It's hard to pick a favorite moment, but one arrangement stands out indelibly in my mind: Mark Wilburg's lush orchestration of the simple carol ""Still, still, still"" overwhelms the soul with rapture that moves me to tears from the opening strains.  In a word, it is sublime.  And yet, this is only one example of the many pieces performed by Libera that moves us beyond anything we've ever heard before.  Truly, ""Christmas In Ireland"" is destined to become a hallmark in anyone's collection of Christmas classics.  It is not to be missed.",1387238400,2,1363,4.626556016597511

5993042,5,B00FHGS6H6,"The first Libera DVD set a standard of 100% quality for music, venue and production. Hence, subsequent work can only be equal or go downhill.  The Christmas album maintains the 100% quality rating.  I doubt that anyone will be disappointed.",1387065600,,240,4.975

5993044,4,B00FHGS6H6,Have Libera's other concert cd as well as their previous Christmas Album.  This is also a very enjoyable concert but somehow I didn't find it quite as enjoyable as the others I have.  The singing as always was exceptional so can only think that possibly the song choices or arrangements did not wow me in the usual way.  Still worth purchasing for any Libera fan.,1386460800,,363,4.553846153846154
5993045,5,B00FHGS6H6,Absolutely a great Christmas DVD that we will watch again and again.  Libera has done it again - great angelic voices and great song arrangements.
