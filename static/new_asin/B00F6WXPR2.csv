5968807,5,B00F6WXPR2,"I never watched the series when it was on SciFi and that is a regret I live with. Classic and great scifi.  During a test of a scientific theory of his own making ala Sam Beckett, Astronaut Commander John Crichton gets sucked into a wormhole and gets spit out into the other end of the universe. Commander Crichton soon teams up with a group of escape prisoners, warrior ka Dargo, priestess or Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan, Dominar Rygel XVI, dethroned ruler of the Hynerian empire aboard a living ship Moya and her ship Pilot.  They run across and joined by peacekeeper Aeryn Sun and later Chiana, the lovable rebel as they try to survive and escape the peacekeepers.  A great scifi with great effects, music and the best wizardy the Henson studio has to offer.  You will be hooked and eagerly want more. Trust me, I know.",1418083200,,811,4.534246575342466

5968811,5,B00F6WXPR2,"This was and still is my favorite tv series. 88 episodes and a two hour series closer is all we've got. However, it is so worth watching. I was skeptical at first as I did not think puppets/muppets and serious science fiction would go together, but boy was I wrong. If you haven't yet taken the farscape plunge, do yourself a favor and dive right in.",1399334400,2,350,4.318181818181818

5968813,5,B00F6WXPR2,"From the very first episode onward, it's pretty obvious that ""Farscape: The Complete Season 1"" is no ordinary sci-fi story -- the characters are outlaws, the ship is alive, and distant galaxies are full of gloriously weird and grotesque Muppets. Fortunately, it's not just unusual but brilliant -- full of irreverent humor, strange alien species, heart-pounding action and eerie sci-fi.

IASA astronaut John Crichton is planning to slingshot his experimental craft, Farscape One, as a one-small-step into interstellar exploration. Instead, he gets thrown through a wormhole, and ends up drifting in a firefight between a vast living prison ship called Moya and the hypermilitaristic Peacekeepers. Obviously, he wants to go home, but isn't sure how.

So he begins a journey with a gang of escaped criminals -- the Delvian priestess Zhaan, the bombastic warrior D'Argo, deposed dominar Rygel, and the prickly, surly ex-Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun, and the grafted-into-Moya Pilot. But his new shipmates aren't the only problem for Crichton.

Among their problems: shapeshifting space bugs, a mad scientist who decides to transform Aeryn, Peacekeeper bounties on their heads, an energy-sucking sorcerer, a planet of turnip-farming hippies, a primitive planet's power struggles, a cult of insane Delvians, a century-old Peacekeeper with some sadistic personal hobbies, an allergy-causing asteroid, and the unexpected pregnancy of their ship. Yes, Moya gets PREGNANT.

But the biggest problem is Crais, a vengeful Peacekeeper commander who is determined to revenge himself on Crichton for the death of his brother. And with the Scarran/Sebacean hybrid Scorpius, he may get the chance to obliterate Moya's crew.

Most first seasons of a great show are either utterly brilliant, or are a slow ramp-up to the brilliance that the show will have in the future. ""Farscape: The Complete Season 1"" actually manages to be both -- it introduces a pretty amazing universe, full of flying Muppets, squeaking insectile robots, Leviathans, and blue-skinned telepathic plant people. There are lots of overarcing storylines twined with clever, intricate one-off episodes and solid personal subplots (such as Zhaan's struggle with her darker self).

And the dialogue is appallingly awesome (""I'm sure your world has no force so ruthless, so disciplined."" ""Oh, we call them linebackers. Or serial killers, depends on if they're... professional or amateur""). Crichton in particular sprinkles his dialogue with fun pop culture references and quotables (""Out the door, turn left at the creature"") but everybody gets great lines (""Mother always said I was the best looking. That's why she had my older brothers banished"").

Ben Browder's Crichton is a thoroughly likable hero -- he seems a bit flaky and utterly fish-out-of-water, but he's also clever, selfless and kind. And while Aeryn is hard-nosed and cold at first, the awesome Claudia Black chips away her iciness and reveals her fears and insecurities. Virginia Hey is brilliant as the walking talking plant-priestess (""You're a VEGETABLE?"") whose serenity hides a terrible past, and Gigi Edgley and Anthony Simcoe give good performances as the rebellious Chiana and hotheaded Luxan warrior. And while Rygel and Pilot are technically played by Muppets, they are gloriously three-dimensional and expressive -- think Yoda, but better.

The first season of ""Farscape"" is awash in the glorious, the grotesque, and some really hilarious science fiction stories. A must-see for those who like their space opera with an edge.",1382313600,7,3542,5.4743589743589745
