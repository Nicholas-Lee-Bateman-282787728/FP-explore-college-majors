7932229,4,B000056KN2,"Twin Signal has nostalgic appeal for me.  It's about Professor Light making Protoman and Megam-  I mean, Professor Otoi making a robot for his grandkid to enjoy.  However, every time he sneezes, Signal, the blue haired robot, turns into a baby robot.  It's never explained and no one cares, it's anime, just go with it.
Soon the prototype, Pulse, appears to cause trouble.  There's a major flaw in his design, though; he's incredibly nearsighted, and this is where his humor comes from.  The show is a comedy sci-fi, and while it's good and funny, it's lighter fare then others.  It's lovely, the music is good and the dubbing... passable.
It's like cupcakes for dinner.  It's a lot of fun while it lasts, but after a while you're going to wish you actually ate something.",1389916800,,772,4.708955223880597

The anime itself is cute, funny and has some fun action too. Anime lovers can't go wrong, I highly recommend Twin Signal to anyone.",1253059200,,273,4.48
7932231,5,B000056KN2,"Not only is the DVD an absolutely great anime to watch (sadly, it's not any longer than this one), but it also holds a great story with funny characters and a great twist to what could be considered a typical situation.
Much recommended to all!

7932232,5,B000056KN2,"This was more of a Twin Signal movie rather than a series since it was so short but it was still a great buy that I've never regretted. The animation is beautiful and somewhat notstalgic in that it does not rely heavily on computer graphics if at all. The story was a nice translation from it's manga counterpart and left me feeling satisfied despite the short length.

The only thing that slightly disappointed me was the promise of so much more to come from the opening credits. Even that wasn't so bad though because it inspired me to get online and look up more on the unshown characters (whose names are briefly listed in the opening credits).

The music is nice and does a good job of setting the tone of the story. I was particularily fond of the ending song which made me smile from the first few notes.

The characters were great despite their short showtime and made me want to watch again and again. Their individual quirks shown and made me fall in love with them each time I watched.

To sum it up. Buy this DVD and you won't be sorry!",1177200000,,1048,4.358974358974359
7932233,5,B000056KN2,"Okay, personally I think this anime is absolutly great. It could easily be watched over and over and not get in the least bit boring. Not everyone will feel this way though, so I'll try to be a little more critical.
If you've read, or are interested and somewhat familiar with the manga (comic) series, this is definatly a must see. For one thing it is just great to see all of the characters animated, even if only in the intro. If you don't know anything about the series before seeing this, it's still good but may not be enjoyed quite as much. I'd recomend that you do a little research on the internet to get more familiar with the characters and plot line.
I also recomend this to any anime fan who likes comedy. If you're only into dramas you'll most likely hate it, but who knows? The plot line is good, but not overly complicated so it should keep your attention, but not leave you wondering what's going on. There is a lot of S.D. but not so much that it's like the animation of Dragon Half. Mostly it's just shown in facial expressions and not the full blown Super Deformed body.
As for the dubbing, I'll admit, it isn't really that bad. I'm really skeptical about any anime being dubbed, but aside from Elara having the voice of Misty from the dubbed Pokemon (I think; if not, it sound's a heck of a lot like her) it is done pretty well. My only major problem is that they changed Elara's name to Erala (what the heck is that about??). But unless you really hate subtitles, take my advise and watch it in Japanese. The english outtakes are hilarious however, so don't miss those. It's a hidden feature but shouldn't be too hard to find.
I was completely satisfied with this DVD, and if it looks good to you, give it a shot, I don't think you'll be disapointed.  They even explain why Signal's hair is shown blue in some pictures and violet in others. I only wish that more than three episodes were animated.
And finally, because a review of this show isn't complete without it, Chibi Signal is just so darn cute! Umida, umida!",994291200,,2038,4.391534391534392
7932234,3,B000056KN2,"This story tells us about a robotic expert who built a robot to be a companion for his grandson. The robot's name is Signal and he is quite powerful in strength, unfortunately, there was a snag in the programming when Signal was created. Whenever the grandson sneezes, the adult robot turns into a baby chocolate-loving robot. The story continues to show us another adult robot whose name is Pulse. Pulse is the prototype for Signal so he is less superior in strength and abilities. It turns out that Pulse was programmed to kill Signal.
Now, for my opinion on the story: The household is quite similar to an American TV sitcom show - a few gags and jokes here and there but without the live audience or laugh track. The dubbing is good but not great. The dubbed voice for Signal was weak - I expected him to be more deep or tempermental as suggested by the back of the DVD case! The opening and closing songs are good but not as good as say the ones from Rurouni Kenshin, Magic User's Club, or Fushigi Yuugi. The only true character I cared about was Pulse. The English dubbed voice for Pulse was great. He sounded a lot like Legato from Trigun but deeper and more angry. I also liked the character design of Pulse way better than Signal, though that may be a prejudice on my part since I love dark characters more. And the story wasn't tight about him being a bad character - not much emphasis in story design. In all, the fight scenes were okay but not very fluid nor dynamic. A warning to all, there a lot of SD (super-deformity) so if you don't like SD, then don't bother watching it. I recommend this to be rented before it's purchased. Twin Signal is a good watch since it is entertaining - it is average but not superb.",987811200,6,1727,4.383177570093458
