Yes go ahead and sing it all the way through. You know its there, you may even be humming it. When you're done go ahead and read.

The television series MISSION IMPOSSIBLE premiered back in 1966 and ran for seven years before calling it quits. It picked up again in the 80s for two seasons before leaving the air again. Eventually Brian DePalma came along and began the movie franchise for the series that continues to this day and deserves to keep going.

But back to 1966. The world was a different place. Dictators ran various countries, the Soviets and the US were not getting along, self-proclaimed generals ran roughshod over their people and America did little on the surface to counter all of them. Not always but for the most part. If you bought into this series, which most of us did, we sent in a team of undercover experts to save the day instead.

While most will think that actor Peter Graves as Mr. Phelps was there from the start the fact is for the first season the team was brought together by the elusive Mr. Briggs played by Steven Hill. Each week Briggs (and later Phelps) would go to some seemingly innocent location, pick up or be given a device on which a message played for them offering them a mission and then that device would self-destruct. This would be followed by him then sitting down and tossing down dossiers on a table or desk as to who he chose to help on this weeks mission.

For the most part the cast remained consistent through the adventures. Barney Collier (Greg Morris) was the tech guy of the team. Willy Armitage (Peter Lupus) was the muscle. Roland Hand (Martin Landau) was an expert in disguise, a top actor. And rounding out the team was Cinnamon Carter (Barbara Bain) the beauty who was used to distract many a bad man. Occasionally another operative was tossed in with the group. Later in the series several members would leave to be replaced by actors like Leonard Nimoy, Lynda Day George and Lesley Ann Warren. But for most it was the initial team they remember.

As I said the show had them take on various dictators and rulers with world domination or destruction on their minds. Examples from the first season included a South American general who possessed nuclear missiles, trying to make the Soviets think one of their own turned traitor, rescuing an elderly yet politically active cardinal, stopping a prince from starting a war with a neighboring country, unfixing a corrupt election in another South American country, stopping a bacterial attack on our country, taking on an international drug dealer and more. And thats just the first season!

The show continued on through 7 years and now that entire series has been collected into one group. I don't mean to sound like a late night TV ad but this is a bargain for fans of the series. Its been offered before in a special box set that looks like a powder keg in the $200 price range or just under. This new box set sells for far less, more near $80. For as much as you get that is a tremendous bargain. It comes in a box that holds three cases, two large and one smaller, holding the entire series of DVDs. If youve already collected the separate years then this won't provide you with anything new. The same for those who bought the keg edition. But if youve held off then now is a chance to get the whole set in one affordable box that is well worth it.

I would have loved to have watched the entire series here before writing but with 10,000 minutes worth of shows to watch that was my own mission impossible. I know that this set will provide me with non-stop entertainment from disc to disc, each year with its own special episodes and enough enjoyment that time will move far too fast once I reach that last disc. If youve never seen the show you're missing one of the greats from the sixties. If you loved the show this is the set to buy.",1445904000,41,3916,4.490168539325842

7337506,5,B011MUA5J2,"Mission: Impossible is a television series that was created and initially produced by Bruce Geller. It chronicles the missions of a team of secret government agents known as the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). In the first season, the team is led by Dan Briggs, played by Steven Hill; Jim Phelps, played by Peter Graves, takes charge for the remaining seasons. The other casts includes Barbara Bain,Barbara Anderson,Greg Morris,Peter Lupus,Martin Landau,Leonard Nimoy,Lesley Ann Warren,Sam Elliott and Lynda Day George. A hallmark of the series shows Briggs or Phelps receiving his instructions on a recording that then self-destructs, followed by the theme music composed by Lalo Schifrin. The series aired on the CBS network from September 1966 to March 1973.

The series follows the exploits of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), a small team of secret agents used for covert missions against dictators, evil organizations and (primarily in later episodes) crime lords. On occasion, the IMF also mounts unsanctioned, private missions on behalf of its members. The identities of the organization that oversees the IMF and the government it works for are never revealed. Only rare cryptic bits of information are ever provided during the life of the series, such as in the third season mission ""Nicole"", where the IMF leader states that his instructions come from ""Division Seven""

The TV show was a classic and it should have lasted longer than 7 season had it maintained its format of covert missions against dictators and evil organizations in foreign countries. But instead in the later seasons,it started to focus on gangsters and crime organization. This made the IMF just a regular police team which diminished the show somehow. But nevertheless,it will be one show that will be missed and it is just sad that even the revival of the TV series in the 80's and Tom Cruise's MI franchise film does not live up to it despite of the show being dated in terms of the technology used by the IMF.In summary,the original remains the best.",1440979200,43,2041,5.107784431137724

7337535,5,B011MUA5J2,"I remember watching Mission Impossible as a family when young. I enjoyed it then and like it even more now. Compared to today's low standards, Mission Impossible would be tame to most. However, that's the reason why I like it. The episodes are based on plot, story, and conversation. No language, sex, sleaze or excess violence. Nice family entertainment. Plus each episode is a spy and agent paradise. Wonderful drama. I like the movies, but the television series exceeds them. The famous theme music is icing on the cake. My wife and I love to watch an episode or two in the evenings.

7337560,5,B011MUA5J2,"Nothing to say but WOW!  It took me a month to watch the entire set,but it was worth it. The plots were so intricate and tense...you almost forgot the IMF team was going to win everyone ,as usual. The writing and actors were great..although Leonard Nimoy seemed out of his element on this one. Martin Landau ..as Rollin Hand,was the superior disguise expert. Perhaps Leonard was still beaming down from Star Trek mentally..because he just appeared to be Spock with long hair and sideburns. Barbara Bain was the best female protagonist on the team...although the others were competent in that capacity. If anybody else had played Barney Collier instead of Greg Morris...I don't think the flavor of the show would have been as great,chemistry wise. Okay...I liked Peter Lupus's character,Willie. He was more than just a strong back. The producers kept him in his limitations as an actor. Overall..This group had great chemistry.",1484352000,12,926,5.052287581699346

7337573,5,B011MUA5J2,"The show is better than I recalled it.  The DVDs have a very clear, and noise free image, and the Dolby 5.1 soundtracks are certainly an improvement over the original mono.  Be aware the first season is not close captioned.  The plastic case the discs are contained in is fragile and easily broken.  The case contains multiple ""pages"" to which the discs are attached, extricating the individual DVDs without the thing coming apart is a challenge.  Just like on the show:  after the information from HQ regarding the mission is imparted to Mr. Briggs/Phelps, the message ""self destructs"".  So does the DVD case.  I have the INSPECTOR LINDLEY MYSTERIES complete box set, and each two DVDs are in a separate case; this is a far better approach.  Even if each disc was in an individual heavy paper sleeve, it would be a significant improvement.  The quality of the material, hopefully, will offset the frustrating packaging.",1470009600,30,920,4.877419354838709
