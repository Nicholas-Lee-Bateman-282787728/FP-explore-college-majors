8078559,5,6305048711,"C-Bear and Jamal is a great miniseries for kids of all backgrounds. It explores the world of Jamal, the son of a single father who experiences adventures thanks to his little buddy, a magical stuffed bear named C-Bear. My children enjoy watching the cartoons that feature the imagination and voice of former rapper, Ton-Loc. His raspy voice 'keeps it real' with urban lingo and humor. The issues are appropriate for children of all ages. The downside of the series is that it has to end. I guess that C-Bear and Jamal was destined to be short-lived because no boy can grow up to be a man toting a stuffed bear around. However, while Jamal grows up, it is fun and entertaining to watch the two's excursions into school and playground life.",1022716800,2,738,4.641221374045801
8078560,5,6305048711,"C-Bear and Jamal is a great video. My children loves watching this video over and over again. I like the way C-Bear helps Jamal solve his problems and by doing so teaches him ""Lessons in Life""! Very up to date  and intelligently put together. I'm buying this video for my children and  another for my niece. Please start the next video. Your fans are waiting!",945302400,3,359,4.507692307692308
