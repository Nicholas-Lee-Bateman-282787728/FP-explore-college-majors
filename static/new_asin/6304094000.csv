7861649,5,6304094000,"My two-year old son has adored this video for over a year and I love the music too!  This is a great introduction for kids travelling anywhere and especially for kids who will be travelling to New York City.  The music is beautifully written and catchy enough that I find myself singing along every time.  Newt the newt is a fun character and the kids in the video are sweet.  I love this video, but my son loves it even more.  He often asks for ""Newt, Newt""!

I have to say that the person who reviewed this video previously has gotten really mixed up and must have ordered the wrong video.  It's also really out of date and should be removed.  I give this video 5 stars for being parent and kid friendly and having the best music of any kids video I've ever seen!",1106784000,,765,4.227586206896552
7861650,1,6304094000,"Like many Buddy Rich fans, I was intrigued by the ""Away We Go in New York City (1967) listing under video (""VHS""), for ""Buddy Rich"" - on Amazon.com. Although, portions of the ""Away We Go"" TV show (Jackie Gleason Show summer replacement in the 1960's) have been included in many of the Buddy Rich Memorial & Jazz Legend videos, we all hope to come across those extra special, never-before-seen video clips of Buddy. Unfortunately, the Amazon listing for this video is very vague, in the way of technical info, but does imply (by the ""1967"" date), that you are purchasing a video w/clips of Buddy Rich from the 1960's ""Away We Go""...even mentions George Carlin & Buddy Greco on some alternate pages!!??).
Sadly to report, though (after opening the mailing package), this video is, instead, a children's travel sing-along (ages 2-8), by the name of ""Jonathan Larson's Away We Go in New York City"", starring Newt the Newt (a Muppet-like character), & co-produced by Bob Golden in 1995 (unlike the advertised ""1967""). No Buddy Rich, George Carlin, or Buddy Greco, on this vid'.
Although I didn't remove the shrink wrap, it's pretty obvious that this is not the ""Away We Go"" video, Buddy Rich fans are looking for...sorry, folks. I'm sure it's a great video for your kids to watch if you're planning on taking them on a trip to NYC, but in light of the recent 9/11 events, this may not suffice.
My advice - don't buy this video unless you are 2-8 years of age, & are really into sing-along videos.
By the way...I submitted changes to the title of this video, so it won't be so deceiving for Buddy Rich fans & it will now read ""Jonathan Larson's Away We Go in New York City (1995)"".
God Bless.",1004745600,13,1686,4.604651162790698
