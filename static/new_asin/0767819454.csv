10048,5,0767819454,"Idle Hands is a fun movie from 1999, it does have a very that era look to it, as well as a soundtrack full of 90's bands like The Living End and The Offspring.  The Offspring actually are in the film as a high school dance band, they play a cover of a Ramone's song I Wanna Be Sedated, and a few of their lesser big hit songs that non fans of theirs probably haven't heard before like Beheaded. But you don't have to have been a teen in the 90's to enjoy this teen aimed horror comedy.  And comedy is what it is, this isn't a movie taking itself seriously or trying to scare you or freak you out.  It's a stoner slacker 90's movie with the horror element of a hand of the town's laziest pothead (Devon Sawa) becoming possessed and becoming a serial killer, starting with the teen's own mum and dag (Fred Wilard, Frank Dunphy in Modern Family) only he's so out of it he doesn't catch on they're dead for a while.  When he does he tries rather unsuccessfully to stop it doing what it wants to do which includes killing his stoner friends (Seth Green and Elden Henson).  But his stoner friends are too lazy to walk up the stairs into the light so their corpses come back with the injuries they sustained.  He's also trying to stop his hand from killing the girl (Jessica Alba) in the house across the street who he's always had a crush on but has been to shy to talk to.

It's a really fun movie.  Sawa does a great performance fighting his hand, there are times when he has some long bits of dialogue while he's looking at the camera or another character and fighting his hand at the same time, that you try just doing the hand part yourself while watching and your arm and wrist becomes quite sore after a while, so it's actually quite impressive what he achieves. Seth Green and Elden Henson as slacker zombies also are brilliant. Jack Noseworthy also brilliantly plays one of those 30 year olds who still trying to score with high school chicks, hanging around bowling alleys and fast food outlets in his oversized wheeled Ford .  He has a line to one, ""still in high school, yeah I left a few years ago myself"" which is hilarious when he doesn't seem to realise they know exactly how old he is.  But it's the canine actor who steals the show early on.  His mouth is shaped to just look like he's giving a what the? expression well when his stoned master is doing weird stuff.  When he's not moving getting pushed on the tiles in front of the scared slacker teen, with his head moving around saying I don't want to be doing this, as he is being used as a shield if there's an intruder is also extremely well done on the dog's part.  The actor's probably not with us anymore nearly twenty years into the future, but I'd love to know what other movies he appeared in to check them out.  The only actors (and it's probably more so the script than them) were the two cops, who didn't seem realistic at all.

On the region 4 DVD there is also a deleted scene from near the end, it has an intro by the director which goes on for a little long explaining why it's not in the film and they reshot the ending. It takes place at the pool in the high school.",1497398400,,3148,4.240802675585284

10067,3,0767819454,"First off, let me just say that when I saw this movie as kid in the 90s I loved it! Now, its an ok movie that is obviously dated.
This is a movie for teens, it doesn't make much sense (I doubt its suppose to) and its over the top. Theres girls, boobs, booze in the movie and a couple of laughs. If you need even more detail then take a horny teen and give him a possessed devil hand that does every and anything (it kills a few people). I vaguely remember the ended, because I fell asleep lol. I don't hate this movie at all. If you love 90s movies then check it out.
My mistake is that I should have held on to the memory of seeing this when I was younger and NOT rewatch it as an adult.

is) but if you can just sit back and enjoy the ride you won`t be disappointed. It has alot of funny moments and some terrificly gruesome scenes. It`s like a
mixture of Trick 'r' Treat, Carrie, Evil Dead 2 and Pet Sematary thrown in a blender quite literally. Its really well made with some fun performances. Could`ve been a little longer tho. Very

10238,5,0767819454,"The very first time I saw Idle Hands, it became one of my favorite (comedy) horror movies of all time! Some people knock on this movie for lacking true horror but clearly Idle Hands was not meant to be a true horror film. If you want true horror over comedy horror, then skip on this and watch The Blair Witch Project or something.

Anton Tobias' is a slacking high school stoner who has no motivation in life and gets through his problems with the simple use of weed and a bong. When his parents end up mysteriously dead a few days before Halloween, Anton becomes the prime suspect; although he has no recollection of ever committing such a heinous act. He enlists the aid of his two equally lazy friends; Pnub and Mick to help him track down the killer, but when he ends up killing them off, Anton realizes that his right hand has become possessed by the Devil .

As multiple more killings follow; fellow high school student, Debi LeCure is on the hunt for who or what is committing the murders. Anton must then team up with his neighborhood crush across the street, Molly (the beautiful Jessica Alba) to find a way to tame his possessed hand before it kills anyone else. Will he be able to stop his evil hand? Who else will become a victim? Can Anton find the courage to ask Molly to the high school's Halloween Prom Dance?

Overall: Idle Hands is a really enjoyable film beginning, middle, and end. Once again, it's a comedy horror film; so if you're expecting this to be a serious horror movie, don't buy it. The plot is great for it's time and the cast is entertaining. They couldn't have chosen a better group of people to put in this movie.",1407715200,,1648,4.4144736842105265

When Anton (Sawa) loses control of his hand to the devil because of his lazy, idle ways, all hell breaks loose. Murder after murder, the hand knocks off suburban inhabitants in creative ways. Raunchy, cornball comedy peppers the horror throughout the movie. Not too bad for what it is, but not family friendly.",1403568000,,464,4.7407407407407405

I think in order to enjoy it you just have to be in the mood for something silly and comedic to not take so seriously. Think of it like sitting around with some friends just talking about stupid crap and coming up with a scenario that would never happen. That's how I see this movie. Either way, i find it funny and quite enjoyable.

Seth Green does some of his best work here ably supported by Elden Henson as the Dumb And Dumber of zombies.  The much much much underrated Devon Sawa leads the cast in this typical teen possessed hand dead buddies comedy that's been done to death!! (that description is much better than you think).  I don't won't to give too much away because this one's gonna blow your mind and free those brains up for gobbling in no time.  Jessica Alba does a sexy turn that only nubile teens in heat and the dead can fully appreciate.  This is the most fun I've had at a teen movie since all of them!!!!  It's hilariously on target and played straight as an arrow.  You will laugh your fool head off!!

The story line revolves around 3 friends who end up smiling all the way until the end. Anton Tobias finds that his very own parents have been brutally murdered but the only thing he doesn't understand is who did it.  His 2 friends come over and help to get Anton high so that he can calm down and forget his problems and then it hits him.  He was the one who murdered his parents and it was because of his Hand.  It is actually possessed.  Now his friends/ the police/ and anyone that he can get his HAND on will be the next target.  Idle Hands are the Devils Playground so will Anton be able to keep his hands occupied long enough to not hurt anyone else or will there be more bloodshed?  The only way to know is to make the purchase and see for yourself :) But I promise if you do you will not be disappointed.  As I said earlier, This movie will have you laughing the entire way through.  I would classify this movie as a Horror/Comedy but to be honest it is more of a Comedy than it is a Horror Film :) So please pick this one up while it is still available and enjoy :)

10301,5,0767819454,"Being a huge film fan all my life, I've always aimed to increase my collection at every turn.  Mixing my two favorite genres: comedy and horror, into a nice blend, ""Idle Hands"" is a film I greatly enjoyed.  The overall mix is done quite well, blending the two genres quite well.

The plot focuses around a teenage boy named Anton Tobias.  Like any other teenager, Anton is lazy and enjoys the usual stereotypical activities such as getting high.  His two best friends are no better than he is, and together the three of them are the ultimate slacker archetype.

Anton is so out of touch with the world that he does not even realize the sudden slaughtering of his parents that occurs, instead deciding to continue with his usual behavior.  It isn't until later that Anton even realizes that both of his parents have been brutally murdered and all of the fingers are suddenly pointing to him as the sole suspect of the crime.  They say that ""idle hands"" do the devil's work, but in this case it's true.  All of those years of doing nothing have come back to haunt Anton.  After inviting his two friends over, Pnub and Mick, Anton's hand suddenly brutally murders the two of them.  It appears as if his hand has a mind of its own, and the only thing on its mind is murder.

His hand begins to make him do further things that he would not normally do upon his own freewill, such as confront the girl next door that he's been crushing on for quite some time.  As it turns out, Molly (Jessica Alba) has always had the same feelings for Anton, but he had never approached her to find out.  After his hand makes him approach Molly, the two of them actually realize how they have truly felt all this time.  This turns out to be the only positive thing that his hand has brought him, but after several other hi-jinks and misfortunes, Anton decides to cut off his own hand, reminiscent of Evil Dead.  Further antics begin to occur, as Mick and Pnub return to life and assist Anton in saving Molly from the demonic hand.  With the assistance of a demon hunter, the group spends the remainder of the film battling the demonic hand in a series of laugh inducing scenes.

I was not expecting much from this film, being the only reason I purchased it was to add to my collection of Jessica Alba films, but I was greatly surprised with the results.  The film is a perfect blend of horror related comedy, kind of amongst the lines of other horror-comedy films such as ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Evil Dead"" and more recently ""Zombieland"".  Being a blend of these two genres means that one cannot take the film seriously, so do not expect award winning writing or acting, it's meant more as a parody of the horror genre.  As long as you know what to expect from this movie you will gladly enjoy a few good laughs and find yourself indulging in a highly underrated film.",1258588800,2,2866,4.462571976967371

Others disagree, saying the film lacked a target audience ang genuine humor.

Maybe its just me but I love this film.  I watch it at least once a year guaranteed.  Not that this review matters or anything (not like its going to make popular a film that has been widely ignored upon release and long since forgotten since then) but I just wanted to throw in my two cents.

10315,5,0767819454,"It's not too often that you get a fine mix of stoner comedy, and good horror/suspense rolled up together into the same movie. And to have them mix as well as the ingredients to a fried peanut butter, jelly and fluff sandwich with bananas. Mmmmmm, thats something worthy of note. Just make sure that the knife you use to make that sandwich with isn't covered in your parents blood.

Idle Hands is a gory thriller, about a demonic hand, that attaches itself to various hosts, and at some point figures out how to run amok by itself. I didn't think too much of this movie going in, but by the end I really enjoyed it. I remember this getting slammed with bad critical reviews back when it came out. Easy to see why. Really, the only ones who can appreciate this are stoned teenagers... or the few who can accept what a stoned teen movie should be all about. Things that will make a stoner movie stand out... Like a hot topless chick in KISS makeup, Mr. Magoo cartoons, and the pet cat getting chucked out a window windmill style by its tail. Add 'em up. Then factor in Jessica Alba, who I've gone all these years considering to be a little bit over rated by teen jock types. She is truly amazing in this film. I'd say her best role ever. She doesn't get topless like the KISS chick, but bedazzles the eyes throughout just the same... especially in that Halloween costume!

Some geniune fright filled scenes here, surely this movie holds up in the teen scream category (much better for instance then any of those ""Scream"" movies... ) as well as good stoner camp material, and a bunch of amusing action too.

10322,4,0767819454,"IDLE HANDS is a movie that I remember always being on the USA Network when I was really young, and I remember it was a sick movie. It still is, but now older (but not wiser), I see this movie for how it should be seen: a twisted little gem that turns the Dawson's Creek world inside out. Yes, SCREAM did it too, but for some reason, the way IDLE HANDS shows us a guy that loves the girl next door and has two dumb buddies like every bad teen movie ever makes the fact that the movie is about a stoner that kills his parents and best friends (who come back as freaking zombies) with his possessed right hand (hi, Ash) so much sweeter. Yes, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but this movie really is underrated in my opinion. It has great music (especially The Offspring's version of The Ramones' I WANNA BE SEDATED), a clever script, great performances (especially by Seth Green & Elden Henson as the zombified buddies Mick and Pnub, who didn't walk up the stairway to Heaven because ""it was too far""), and sly direction by Rodman Flender, who has done TALES FROM THE CRYPT episodes, which at times this movie shares its tone with. Overall, IDLE HANDS is great for horror fans that like their horror with a wink and a nod, and it even throws in some unnecessary nudity, just like the good ol' days.",1175299200,,1299,4.327868852459017

10327,3,0767819454,"The trailers for ""Idle Hands"" implied the film was a madcap horror comedy when, in reality, the filmmakers created something more along the lines of ""An American Werewolf in London."" Granted, they don't come near the high water mark of that film, or even the later ""Fright Night"" or ""The Lost Boys,"" but ""Idle Hands"" has genuine moments of horror along with its comedy, although neither element is particularly memorable.

From the icky premise to the icky undead friends acting as Greek chorus to the hot babe inexplicably drawn to the protagonist to the dark finale, ""Idle Hands"" bears the mark of the creators watching ""American Werewolf"" over and over and over again while creating this film.

Of course, it's not as though ""An American Werewolf in London"" is difficult to find at your local video store. For those looking for those sorts of thrills, stick with the original, as well as ""Fright Night"" and ""Lost Boys.""

If you've seen any recent horror flicks within the past 10 years(Taking Lives, Wrong Turn, I Still Know What you Did Last Summer, Scream), then you know it's filled with the dummest imaginable good guys, cheesy plot and almost un-killable bad guys. And scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end. I almost fell asleep in a few of those movies, that's how lame, tiring and boring they are. Fortunately, for this film, it has Jessica Alba and Seth Green, who are two fantastic actors/actresses and are always delightful to see. Seth Green is hilarious as the main characters buddy, and Jessica Alba is more then sexy. However, the movie is beyond cheesy(like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window, smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush, but it can't escape the microwave. Or, when the lady(played by Vivica A. Fox(Kill Bill)) is hit by a car, which is backing up, and then is sent 50 feet. Uh huh, that's realistic. Ends sarcasm.) Then there is tones of un-necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head. And how exactly did his buddies get back? They don't explain anything and assume everything is magical. It delivers the comedy pretty well, thanks to Seth Green for that, but is just too silly, far too cheesy and extremely lame(a hand that is possessed?

Worst of all, he's ""dry"": totally out of fuel for the bong. Forced to face the bleak prospect of a cheerless world not percolating to the hazy slacker cumulus of marijuana. Oh, and there's a brutal serial killer loose on the streets: a maniac who slaughters his victims, skins them alive, and---when the need arises---takes eyeballs and other chunky bits as souvenirs.

Life can be a real b*tch when you haven't yet turned 18.

Anyway, things quickly get rough, brutal, bloody, and totally out of hand (heh). Questions mount right along with the body count: Where are Anton's parents? Who is slaughtering his friends and neighbors? Is it wise to try score weed off a cop, even if y'all went to the same high school? Will Anton ever really muster up enough courage to ask the hottie of his dreams (the truly luscious Jessica Alba) to the prom? And it is possible---perhaps probable?---that his suddenly wanderlusting hand might have something to do with the wanton bloodletting and recent reign of terror?

""Idle Hands"" is perfectly adorable on all counts and entertains scandalously: don't be alarmed by the 90210-ish packaging or the blurbs that make this thing out to be an innocent romantic comedy.

I was nearly scared away by all the chick-friendly marketing, but I persisted---and happily, I found this little romp in the cemetery to be sick, twisted, and totally freakish. Seth Green (Anton's slacker buddy Mick) gets to spend some up-close-and-personal cranial quality time with a beer bottle (local brew). Buddy Pnub (the hysterical and eminently blase Eldon Henson) loses his head and sees his social life improve---albeit with a little duct tape and a garden trowel. Dexter (lead singer of Offspring, who does a killer cover of the Ramones ""I wanna be Sedated"") gets scalped by an evil possessed right hand (played, admirably and with great dramatic restraint, by Christopher Hart, who plays hands and nothing else. I'm not kidding).

""Idle Hands"", turned out by director Rodman Flender and a talented SWAT team of special effects mavericks, is simply all kinds of cool.

I mean, come on: you have Ramones cover songs. You have Hands Baked Alaska in the microwave. You have adorable little kitty cats nibbling away at eyeballs and licking up spilled blood. You have one of the uber-coollest opening sequences (""I'm Under the Bed""---oh BOO-ya!) in horror movie history, in which veteran character actor Fred Willard plays Dad. You have Vivica Fox brandishing a meat-cleaver and screaming ""die, Host of Evil!"". You get ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Evil Dead"" tributes---who am I kidding, ""Idle Hands"" is itself one long Evil Dead tribute. You get slacker friends consigned to walk the Earth forever as the soulless Living Dead---all because they hated the white light, the Enya Music, and the general sense that Heaven meant having to ""walk to far"".

Anyway, the horrific, ugly, malign, diabolic evil slaughtering hand is one of the staples of Grand Guignol horror, and Flender and Company hit the ball out of the park and work their material like champs. Hell ain't so bad if you have good (undead) friends and plenty of Cheesey-Poofs---give the boy a Hand.

10331,5,0767819454,"Ok, I was looking for a stupid movie to watch with my best friend, and I came across ""Idle Hands"". I read some of the reviews on here to see if the movie was any good. Man, what's up with the people who don't like this movie? GO SEE IT NOW!

IT IS AWESOME! More than half of the people who said that the movie sucked complained that it was ripped off of other movies. Yeah, so? Newsflash: That's why it's funny! DUH! That's like someone seeing ""Scary Movie"" and then saying that it was dumb because it was ripped off of other movies. Don't people get the fact that this movie is making fun of other horror movies? Now that that is out of the way...

Ok, I'll admit it, I only picked up this movie because Seth Green is in it. He's one of my all time favorite actors, and he's SO HOT! This movie is about a group of stoner friends who are the laziest people you've ever seen. The laziest is Anton Tobias. Apparently, Idle Hands are the Devil's Playground, so Anton's ""idle"" right hand becomes possessed by the devil. Yeah, I know, it sounds pretty dumb. But, this movie is actually really funny. I guess the trick is not to take this movie too seriously. Anyway...

Anton cannot control his murderous right hand, so it begins to kill people. Including his parents and his two best friends Mick (Seth!) and Pneub. Thankfully, his friends come back from the dead because heaven was too far away and they didn't want to walk that far (haha!). Eventually, Anton chops off his hand with a butcher knife. Now, with the help of his two un-dead buddies and one crazy Devil Hand Killer (Vivaca A. Fox), Anton must catch his hand before it kills the love of his life, Molly (Jessica Alba).

I loved this movie! It's just so out there and crazy that you have to laugh. This movie isn't for everybody, especially for people that:

1. Are strict movie critics-This movie is a cross between ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" or any other stupid stoner movie and any movie that involves a killer hand so, yeah, obviously it's gonna have some plot holes!

2. Don't have a good sense of humor or don't find things that are kind of...umm...""sick"" humorous-Yeah, I guess this is black comedy. You know, it's like oh! Let's watch this kid eat blood or let's heat this burrito up in that microwave that's full of blood or let's poke fun at the Texas Chainsaw Massacre! (""What? Did he just say he was Leatherface? That's not funny. People died, you know!"") Seth acting like Leatherface was one of my favorite parts of the movie. So, it's all in fun.

3. Have really, really, really weak stomachs- Man, everyone's like, Oh! This movie is SO DISGUSTING! No, actually it's not! The gore is just stupid and laughable. Like, ""stupid gore"". If you're like me you'll say, Whoa? Did he just use a barbecue fork and duct tape to stick that guy's head back on? Is that cat eating an eyeball (which looks really fake)? And then you'll just laugh you head off. I love a movie with lots of blood and gore. I'm just weird like that I guess!!!!

4. Are young and impressionable kids- I personally wouldn't let a little kid watch this movie. You know, 13 and up. Depends on how mature they are. There is a lot of pot smoking and nutmeg/oregano smoking in this movie. There's language, but it's not like a kid wouldn't have heard that stuff before. Some ""stupid gore"". Nudity, which made me mad (I'll get to that next). But I can see some kid now, ""Mom, so if I sit around all day and do nothing, my hand will be possessed by the devil? Cool!"" Hahaha...

5. Are offended by nudity- Ok, this was the only part of the movie that made me mad. Why is it always women? I mean, was it really necessary for that girl to be topless in the car scene. I don't think we really needed that in this movie. The last thing we need to premote is the fact that a lot of girls are turning into *coughslutscough* because of what they see on tv and in movies. But why is it always women? There were plenty of hot guys in that movie! Man...

Ok, I've talked for long enough! GO SEE THIS FREAKING MOVIE! It rocks. Has some great one-liners ( ""I'm not going through all that Tonya."") Have some fun. Watch a stupid movie...

10333,3,0767819454,"""Idle Hands"" starts as a horror film, but after the opening 10 minutes, it's very obvious that this movie is also a comedy. This film features some spoofs to classic horror films like ""The Shining"", ""The Evil Dead"" or ""The Night Of The Living Dead"". As a matter of fact, ""Idle Hands"" works better as a comedy than as a horror film.

 The cast includes a lot of young actors like Devon Sawa (Anton), Seth Green (Mick), Elden Hensen (Pnub) and Jessica Alba (Molly). We already know that Seth Green is very funny and Jessica Alba is charming, but the surprise in this movie is Devon Sawa. He uses a lot of physical tricks and shakes his hand in a funny and convincing way.

 The plot is kinda silly and obviously has holes here and there, but the dialogues are the main attraction here, the characters talk in double sense, with irony and black humor, and they make a lot of funny references to Anton's hand, Pnub's severed head or the bottle inserted into Mick's head.

 This an amusing movie, it's good enough to entertain the audience for 90+ minutes, the MTV 2 soundtrack features tracks performed by bands like The Offspring, Rancid and Rob Zombie. ""Idle Hands"" is a movie for young people looking for laughs, it's much better than the average teenager slasher flick.

A few minutes into the movie, I thought it was a horror movie. Even then I was disappointed because it's not nearly horrifying enough. Then a third of the movie gone by, the plot became more and more ridiculous, and only then did I realize that the filmmakers wanted to make it a black comedy. But just that the movie has the style of a black comedy doesn't mean that the filmmakers would feel obliged to offer you any laughs, witty dialouges or dark humor. The movie has none of those.

Bringing back his friends (Seth Green, Elden Henson) as zombies is a direct ripoff from both American Werewolf movies, and even though derivative as such, are buoyant and fun.  Viveca Fox as the hand hunter is hilarious, as is Jack Noseworthy as the pseudo-studly Randy.  There is lots of gore, pot smoking, even nutmeg/oregano smoking, but in this day and age, what teen movie wouldn't have it.  The overuse of soundtrack songs is as always distracting, but again, when one targets a teen audience, this is what one gets.  However, the musical score itself by Graeme Revell is very good.

Well, anyway, I enjoyed this film, yet I feel I've been down this road before.  The only real difference is that the characters are all a bunch of stoners, for the most part.  It involves one particular stoner who wakes up one morning and finds his parents are not around, though he seems too stoned to care.  Though there is a serial killer on the loose, all he cares about is scoring some more weed...which, to most stoners, is pretty right on the target.  He comes to find out later that HE is actually the killer!  Big surprise!  I won't say anymore about the plot though.  If you've seen Evil Dead or Re-Animator, you're really in for nothing new to the genre.  The gore scenes are pretty interesting, but nothing to really single it out as a gore classic either.  Mediocre at best, Idle Hands only really stands out in the defiant attitude of the time it was released just nearly a week after the Columbine Massacre.

Sawa trys to save Jessica Alba(Honey, Dark Angel) and Vivica A.

10374,2,0767819454,"Remember all those really campy films from the 1950s such as The Crawling Hand?  Idle Hands is basically the same type of movie, only much sillier, much campier, and in some respects embarrassingly bad.  The filmmakers really don't even bother to explain the whole silly concept; a corporeal, murderous hand on the rampage normally doesn't need a lot of background info, but in this case Anton (Devon Sawa) simply has his own hand somehow possessed without the rogue hand causing all the mischief even finding him.  Only after Anton cuts his hand off, do we return to the more traditional animated, murderous hand on the rampage theme, and that works much better than Anton's constant battle to control what his right hand is doing as long as it is attached to his arm.  As far as the rest of the explanation goes, we have a Druidic priestess (Vivica A. Fox) trying to find and destroy the hand before midnight Druid time, at which time the hand will take a soul into the netherworlds.  In my opinion, this story doesn't even begin to work.
A little bit of comedy is supplied by the always-funny Seth Greene (who plays Mick) and his buddy Pnub (Elden Henson).  These two, along with Anton, are the triumvirate of lazy, pot-smoking teens (just the type of victim said hand likes to prey upon).  Probably the funniest part of the film involves the reappearance of an undead Pnub and Mick (who carries his severed head around with him most of the time); the staircase to heaven, they said, was just too far to walk, so they decided to just stay on earth.  The only bright spot in this film, and the only reason I wanted to see it, is Jessica Alba.  I was somewhat amazed to see some of the facial expressions and attitudes she would later display in her role in the incredibly good TV series Dark Angel.
Idle Hands is just too stupid to be at all horror-inspiring, and it is too stupid to even be funny for the most part.  I usually love these types of campy films, but in this case I would have to say that the fellow with the most idle hands of all was the scriptwriter, as he really didn't give us much of a story for this film.",1066262400,5,2128,4.447300771208226

However, they did a pretty good job on the blood, make-up and special effects.

10413,2,0767819454,"Idle hands is hopefully at the end of a cycle of horror flixs that was started in 1996 by Scream, a satire of the slasher pictures of the 70s. Like all cycles in the movie business, this one has been brought down by the weight of too many cheap and derivative knockoffs When this happens, it finally doesn't matter if a movie in the category is good or not. People don't buy it. Ironically, the next big cycle was kicked off this summer by another, albeit more sophisticated and serious, horror genre - the psychological horror / ghost story [The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense]. Idle Hands is further handicapped by being neither one of the best nor one of the worst of the ""scream"" cycle.
It starts off well enough. The time is Halloween. What other time is there? Young Anton's parents retire to bed. After the lights go out, they see an ominous message written on the ceiling. All hell breaks loose, and this sequence unspools like a twisted situation comedy. The next morning, Anton [Devon Sewa] wakes up, oblivious to the fact that his parents have gone missing. But then the teenager is oblivious to almost everything except drugs, sex and rock and roll, as are his two best friends, Mick and Pnub [Seth Green and Elden Ratliff]. As the day progress, it becomes apparent that one of Anton's hands has taken on a mind of its own. It has become homicidal. Most of the funniest moments in the movie show the boy and his deranged hand fighting for control. Devon Sewa, like Jim Carrey, is a very physical actor.
Idle Hands is a homage to many old movies. The uncontrollable hand reminds me of a Peter Sellers character, Dr. Stranglove, in the movie of the same name. The opening pays tribute to Halloween, while the dance scene is straight out of Carrie. Anton's ghostly friends are just like the ones in An American Werewolf in London. One problem is that Idle Hands is nowhere near as good as the movies it salutes.
The bigger problem is that every character is self-centered and stupid. The writer and the director do not understand that, even when a movie is a horror satire, if the audience cannot relate to any character, interest quickly wanes. One morning Anton discovers his parents have been whacked, and, by that night, he's trying to make it with the girl next door. You can laugh at this idiot, but do you really care about him? This is not to say that there are no clever scenes in the movie. It is to say that the audience's involvement remains superficial. It's one of those pictures that leaves no impact and is forgotten by the next day.",1016755200,,2564,4.5519480519480515
10414,5,0767819454,"""Idle Hands"" has got to be one of the best horror/comedies ever. I absolutely love this film, it is filled with so much horror and comedy that you can't really put it into just one genre. ""Idle Hands"" is basically about pot-head Anton (Devon Sawa)whose right hand gets possessed by the devil and takes him on a wild (and hilarious) killing spree. The plot is simple, but the actors are what bring the film to life. Seth Green, Devon Sawa, and Elden Henson make the perfect trio of burn-outs and are absolutely hysterical. Jack Noseworthy is also good as the Motley-Crue-loving-motor-jock. The film is excellent, but what really brings this DVD to life are the features. We get a commentary by Rodman Flender, Seth Green, and Elden Henson, which is very informative and fun to listen to. You learn a lot of facts from the commentary; like how Seth and Elden won the role of Mick and Pnub, how Devon Sawa used a real butcher-knife for the hand-chopping sequence, Rodman poitning out numerous goofs and cameos by The Offspring, Ricky Martin, and a member of Blink-182, and many other little facts. The deleted scene is actually an alternate ending, which is totally different than the theatrical ending, and there is an introduction with Rodman Flender explaining why they cut it. Even though this ending is good, I still prefer the theatrical ending. Then we get some interesting storyboard-comparisons of two scenes, which are fun to watch if you really like the film. The production notes and talent files are okay, nothing special, and the making of featurette is good, you'll also learn some interesting facts and see how they did some of the effects. Then we finish with the trailers for ""Idle Hands"" and ""Can't hardly wait"". The trailer is good, it features a few glimpses of some cut scenes, see if you can catch em'.

10418,4,0767819454,"This is one of those movies, at least to me, that even though it is simple and often times crude I just don't get tired of it. It really isn't a horror film but then it's not a comedy either as most of the humor, weed jokes aside, revolve around bad horror puns. The plot revolves around Anton, a completely worthless character, who basically does nothing but watch television and smoke weed all day. His friends are almost as bad but seem slightly more motivated than our dear friend Anton. Unknowingly to Ant, his hand has become possessed by evil since it has been idle, hence the title. He has already killed a boat load of people, including his own parents, before the discovery is made that his hand is evil. Present at the time of this discovery are his two friends who are quickly killed and then later buried only to rise up from the ground as Anton's undead friends. Oh, did I mention that the beautiful but slightly disturbed Molly (Jessica Alba) lives by Ant. Well she does and Ant, aside from the fact he is a total waste of space, actually hooks up with her, even with his evil hand. So Ant continues to kill and eventually lops of his hand with a butcher knife, only then to release the limb upon the world without the restrictions of a body. So he and his friends go in search of the hand, as the evil slayer (Vivica A. Fox) is also in search of it as she has been the entire movie in small little fragments of screen time. Everyone (Ant, 2 undead friends, Molly, demon slayer etc.) arrives at a school dance where Ant, after nearly being killed by the evil slayer, learns that he made a mistake in cutting off his hand as now it can more easily fulfill its purpose, which involves killing Molly at midnight. And no suprises here...it ends as you would expect it to end. Idle Hands compares miserably to the brilliant hand possession work done by Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead 2 but that has nothing to do with anything. It has ample amounts of gore, actors that make the script enjoyable (esp. the undead friends), and is something that you'll like if you enjoy horror and have that ""off"" sense of humor.",999820800,,2119,4.408163265306122

Along with his Equally Lazy Friends (turned Un-dead Lazy Friends) Mick (Seth Green) and Pnub (Eldon Henson), and his Girlfriend Molly (Jessica Alba), Anton sets out to stop his Evil hand from Killing Everyone he Knows.

Alba is the most Talented Screen Goddess to emerge since Salma Heyek in ""Desperado"", plus (like Salma) she is Funny, Smart and Believable. Green and Henson play the Comic Relief roles well, but the Material occasionally leaves them high and dry with nothing Clever to say. But on a Whole, they are two Funny guys.
The Bizarre Storyline provides Ample Shocks and Sniggers, but it Never really strives for Outright Horror or Comedy, it aims for the Middle ground and it claims it well. Critics have attacked the film for it's Gross out Violence and Dim-witted humour... But isn't that what the Audiences want.

I happen to fall into the latter category, and  although I do believe there are good movies aimed at that particular  audience (teens) I don't feel this is it..  The writing is underdeveloped,  with a story that is, although has its moments, seems to be trying to hard  to be humourous while still maintaining its horror element - resulting in a  graphic gore element mixed with botched comedy.  This, like HALF BAKED,  seems to support dope smoking, although the interpretation can be that that  is the reason Anton's two friend's end up dead and he has a possessed hand  because he is lazy and is going no where with his life.  Yet this is  nullified when the kids still smoke it at the end, contributing the end to  `good marijuana'  The main character's name I figured was a nod to Anton  LaVey, who is the founder of the modern day Satanic church.  There is no  explanation given why Anton's two friends come back from the dead, other  than they just didn't want to go `toward the light'.  In a scene  reminiscent of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD they come out of the ground,  providing gross humour.  Like the horror genre it is more of a spoof of  than an actual example, there is nudity (two kids decide to fornicate and  are dressed in KISS costumes).

As in most movies, the requisite girl (played here  by Jessica Alba) has nothing better to do but to be a sexual object, and be  in danger. She is apparently a ""songwriter/musician"" but that's  just thrown in there for the hell of it and has no purpose whatsoever. In  fact, none of the female characters here are at all developed. The  ""evil-fighter"" just randomly appears. The other girl has no point  but to die. The movie is mindlessly gory.

Not the best film  to display his immense talent, but Green definately shines in this movie.  Jessica Alba (and I hold no biases based on my love for her haha) also  displays that young talent, although often type-cast, can still bring 'em  home.
I wasn't impressed with Vivica A. Fox's character in any way, but  the others seemed to click with me.

10538,5,0767819454,This is my favorite movie so I figured Id register and give it 5 stars. Being a fan of Horror(B-Movies) I am sure helped. Being a Columbia picture probably helped this flick don't kid yourself. This wasn't as low-budget  flick as one might aspect. The actors are all A -quality and the special  effects are done well. And Columbia doesnt hire garbadge. Either way you  get the best flick for the money. The DVD is a must with all the extras.  SOUND is INCREDIBLE even has Audio Commentary with Seth Green. Widescreen  and Full Screen features along with another ending makes this a MUST for  any small collection. This is my FAVORITE MOVIE.,952128000,,640,4.619469026548672

If you are  going to be tormented by the souls of the undead, Seth Green and his pal  are the ones you would want because at least they would bring chips and a  cooler of beer.

This is the coolest, funniest, best horror movie I'v ever seen. I'v  seen it 5 times (so far) one time with Commentary (to bad Sawa were not in  it) It's not scary, but then I don't care. What I want in horror is cool  one liners and gore (the more the better) and this one has  both.
""Sorry About your bush"" Love it. ""You can always go  back if you want to get a piece"" Priceless
Can hardly wait to see  Final Destination and other future Sawa (and Seth Green) movies. Just  love'em after having seen this thing.
Not much logic, but who cares, just  eat popcorn, drink your Coke, on plug your brain, AND ENJOY.

The actors do a great job and the dialogue is totally believable; despite the pot-smoking and lax  attitude of the teenagers, the swearing is relatively limited, which I  always think of as a sign of a good film. Don't get me wrong - this isn't a  great film, it's silly schlock - but it's entertaining, fun schlock.  Watching the film with the audio commentary by the director and two of the  actors (after you've seen the film straight through the first time) is a  blast and a half. Definitely worth getting on DVD just for the audio  commentary. Reminds me of a combination of Half-Baked, Clerks, and Evil  Dead 2.",947894400,,735,4.557251908396947

The story was one of the most pathetic I have seen in a  long time, and it resembled something of a late-night B Movie. In fact,  I've seen B movies with a better plot than this. Evil Dead 2 was 10 times  funnier in it's 20 minute possessed hand sequence, and a lot more original.  And the ending??? could they have come up with anything worse??? the chick  is tied up on to a car that is going to flatliner here on the ceiling,  which has a pentagram painted on it??? give me a break. but, like I said,  when you have guys like Seth Green smoking weed in a movie, it's sure to be  a winner with a lot of brainless teenagers who don't know what a real  horror movie is. or a comedy for that matter.",937699200,,863,4.059171597633136

7788817,4,0767819454,"Rodman Flender is great at directing sophomoric cinema.  Here, he's able to balance horror and comedy very adeptly with the various personalities he's dealing with.  Yes, it's an unapologetic stoner film, but it's very entertaining. It never falls back on it as crutch too much.  The film is just a set up for ridiculous and occasionally morbid supernatural comedy. Though clearly lower budget it has some impressive special effects and a decent performance from Jessica Alba in a thankless role.  I'm a bit disappointed he hasn't continued making unique feature films.  This wasn't successful and so he found a niche in TV. On the other hand, I kind of feel that he perfected the beats of this kind of film with Idle Hands.  So, he would most likely try to move and try something new.  Either way, I'd be interested in seeing what he does.  I think he's an under appreciated film director and those are dime a dozen.  He stands out to me, though, because he's able to get solid performances from just about everybody in this.  I can do without Vivica A Fox, but that's just me.
