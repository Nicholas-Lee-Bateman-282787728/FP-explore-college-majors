1641162,3,B00005OCQX,Why do partial secrets get revealed? To cause curiosity to bring about unfortunate events?  Some interesting details about electrical energy and scientific experiments with psychic abilities and environmental anomalies. The biggest secret is that human life has been compromised in the the name of military applications of science an technology.,1372204800,,345,5.9
1641163,4,B00005OCQX,"Both the KGB and the DIA/CIA engaged heavily in various forms of paranormal research for several decades, especially towards the end of the Cold War.  A few short books are available on the US programs and results but only provide low-level descriptions of the programs, the experiences of a few participants and anecdotal results.  This film is similarly descriptive and a bit heavy handed in presentation, but worth seeing to get a sense of the kinds of projects attempted.",1370563200,,475,5.0
1641164,2,B00005OCQX,"Yes, some interesting points are brought up but the evidence presented is questionable to say the least. Sources are scarcely cited, and things are said to have happened based on no evidence. Additionally, the videos presented seem to be, for lack of better terms, totally fake.",1360454400,4,278,5.065217391304348
1641165,4,B00005OCQX,"Four paranormal topics are explored. Psychics - Mind altering machines, microwave signals, telepathic predictions, mind control, just some of the things that the KGB experimented in  an attempt to get the upper edge on the rest of the world. These topics discussed briefly. Tunguska - What happened in the Siberian forest in 1908, was it a comet, meteor, or spaceship that exploded over the forest that was 2000 times stronger than the bomb dropped in Hiroshima. Also shown in brief is a crashed UFO recorded by the KGB in 1968 of a crashed saucer, this was very interesting. Ghosts - Some extremely amazing footage of ghosts caught on camera by the KGB. Are they real, make up your own mind. Remote viewing - also discussed in brief.
Total running time 86 minutes. Video transfer is good, audio is Dolby 2.0. Motion menus. Extras, there is a trivia where your asked five questions plus a biography for Josef Stalin. Disc 4/5, video 4/5, audio 3/5, extras 1/5. At this ... price, its worth the purchase if your into history and the unexplained.",1051315200,13,1044,4.767955801104972
1641166,4,B00005OCQX,It's an oldie but goodie. Interesting but not spectacular in anything revealed.,1412899200,,79,5.666666666666667
1641167,5,B00005OCQX,wow this was mind blowing please put more stuff like this on prime will like to see l.a mazulli the watchers series on prime.,1401840000,,125,4.25
1641168,1,B00005OCQX,I hope who ever paid for this movie to be on Prime did not pay a great deal of money. It was like watching a film strip in grade school. I bet they don't event used them any more. (beep) next frame. I am not sure there was a whole lot of information the film was based on. Maybe some of the most important stuff was not declassified.,1399161600,,333,3.911764705882353
1641169,3,B00005OCQX,"How much of this is real and how much of it is a joke, I don't know???  But, it is certainly interesting and poses quandries and speculations which either time or further investigations will reveal.  Worth watching again and so I will!",1395532800,,235,4.571428571428571
1641170,3,B00005OCQX,"Interesting but boring, and had heard of most of this information before. It may be the age of the show. If I had seen it when it had first aired I'm sure it qould have a better rating",1391817600,,184,3.8684210526315788
1641171,1,B00005OCQX,"This selection worked on me like chloroform. I should keep a DVD in my nightstand for the occasional sleepless night. I was so deeply asleep after tuning in, I'm not even sure if I finished the program. The most paranormal aspect was how it drained the life out of me. How can supernatural be so boring with the added whiff of boiled cabbage and vodka? How did they scare Roger Moore into narrating? The greatest mystery here is how this program was created without the entire production company being lulled into a senseless stupor.",1385683200,3,533,4.680851063829787
1641172,4,B00005OCQX,"Don't underestimate the Russians... We all know about the psychic abilities of some people in todays times. Unfortunately, in typical Russian paranoia mentality, it would be used for military purposes. I am not Russian, but I do know they are NOT a stupid people. And,yes I do believe in the ability of some people to have sensitivity to energies most of us do not have. Not a bad movie!",1384300800,,387,4.6231884057971016
1641173,5,B00005OCQX,"This is a fascinating insight, not just into the subject itself, but also into what the KGB were investigating. They show a very wide range of interests and came up with some fascinating observations. Well worth watching.",1379980800,,221,5.0
1641174,2,B00005OCQX,"Didn't much care for it.  Stopped watching about 10 minutes in.  As a point of reference, I LOVED THE X-FILES SERIES AND THE MOVIE!",1378339200,,131,4.416666666666667
1641175,1,B00005OCQX,As if the KGB would all of a sudden just divulge this stuff.  This is all complete fabrication and I cannot believe Roger Moore stooped so low to do this.,1375056000,3,154,4.133333333333334

7948865,3,B00005OCQX,"Good for being old and repeating the same paranormal cases that has been on every other show of its type. There needs to be some new shows reporting on new cases. Seems like it's always a different show but same material over and over again. Then if they seem to be reporting on something good or controversial the show soon is taken off the air.

7948868,3,B00005OCQX,"Since I dissed the sister documentary ""The Secret KGB UFO Abduction Files"", I suppose it's time to give the Devil his due. ""The Secret KGB Paranormal Files"" is actually quite interesting!

Narrated by Roger Moore (""James Bond""), the documentary is a veritable smorgasbord of paranormal and related claims from the Soviet Union. It covers Wolf Messing, remote viewing, telekinesis, UFO crashes, Kirlian photography, mental programming and KGB research into Qigong.

The perspective is that of ""true believers"", and the researchers featured make some pretty outlandish claims. I would therefore advise anyone interested in the paranormal to check and double-check every statement of supposed fact made by Moore & Co. Personally, I found the ""standard"" parapsychology claims pretty believable, while some other claims are probably bogus or even comic. Reagan is supposed to have monitored Gaddafi's movements by paranormal means during the US bombings of Libya - well, if so, his remote viewers failed, since Gaddafi (of course) survived!

I don't doubt that the military and intelligence communities in both the United States, the Soviet Union and China conducted research on the paranormal during the Cold War. Of course they did. Parapsychology was on the verge of becoming a respectable science in the decades following World War II. Besides, I suppose it's the job of the secret services to poke their noses into everything, including ""things that go bump in the night"". Black-ops, anyone?

If they really did what this documentary claims they did, I leave to the viewer's own discretion. ""The Secret KGB Paranormal Files"" is a bit dragging and somewhat too long, but I nevertheless give it the OK rating of three stars.",1419724800,,1722,5.273722627737226
7948869,4,B00005OCQX,"This documental exposes very interesting perspectives on governments paranormal experiments and secret war involvements.
Very interesting.",1415404800,,138,7.6875
