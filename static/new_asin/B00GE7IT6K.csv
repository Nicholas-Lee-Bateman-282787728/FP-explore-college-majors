6074175,4,B00GE7IT6K,"METRO MANILA is as much a heartbreaking drama of trying to make it in the big city as it is a crime thriller, probably even more so. Sean Ellis, who directed, wrote, produced and did the cinematography has crafted an excellent story that, while a little too familiar in some respects, is still powerfully acted and beautifully shot. In fact, the visual authenticity is what gripped me the most. Having been to the Philippines a couple of times, I felt like these were locations that I had seen before (even though I hadn't been to the ones specifically used for the film). There are dozens of shots capturing all of the various aspects of life in Manila, from the squalor of the slums to the bright lights of the Metro area. Everything is shown, and nothing is held back. The cinematographic choices also lend a degree of realism to the drama of the story.

 As far as acting is concerned, everyone did a good job as far as I could tell, although some line readings did seem to be a little off. In particular, the actors who played Oscar Ramirez and Douglas Ong stood out. The story the film tells is quite a familiar one, although the execution and setting is what make it seem fresh. Basically, Oscar moves his family from the rice terraces of Banaue to Manila, in hopes that they will be able to make a better living. Oscar gets a job as an armored car driver, while his wife Mai takes a job at a hostess bar (similar to juice bars in South Korea). While there, both are confronted with the harsh realities of city life and are forced to make difficult choices for themselves. Seeing some of the things that they, Mai in particular, have to go through was painful to watch at times, but it helped in making these people easy to sympathize with. Generally, the story doesn't take too many surprising turns, but the way in which it ends was definitely emotionally satisfying.

 As far as the action is concerned, while the film seems to be billed as a crime thriller, this isn't entirely accurate. Yes, crime is a part of the overall narrative, but at its heart the film is a family drama. This might disappoint people going in hoping for a shoot-em-up, but this film is more thought-provoking than it is riveting in an action-film sense. Trying to escape poverty is one of the film's biggest themes, and the way in which this was portrayed is, in my opinion, what sets it apart from other movies like it. Overall, I thought that the film was well-made, well-acted, well-shot, etc., even if the story wasn't the most original. Fans of foreign and Filipino cinema should definitely check this out, and I would also recommend it to anyone willing to give it a chance.",1409788800,4,2666,4.536382536382536
6074176,3,B00GE7IT6K,"Phillipino version of ""Training Day"". A little slow in the beginning but it picks up. Well acted but I give it a 5 out of 10.",1409443200,,125,3.8461538461538463

6074178,4,B00GE7IT6K,"Oscar Ramirez (Jake Macapagal), his wife Mai (played by the lovely Althea Vega) and their two young children live in the Filipino countryside as impoverished farmers. With no prospects ahead, they decide to move to the huge megalopolis of Manila. However they soon find themselves there struggling, with no jobs, no place to live and conned out of their few savings. Things seem to start going up a bit when the seemingly nave Oscar finds a job as a chauffeur in an armored delivery company and Mai as a hostess in a seedy bar. Oscar's coworker Douglas (John Arcilla, in a great performance as a deeply corrupt man) seems too friendly, even giving him for free an apartment for him and his family to live. And if this seems too good, it is, since he has some nasty criminal plans for Oscar.

The first part of the film is social commentary on the reality of a megacity like Manila, the second part becomes more of a genre film (I found the social commentary side of the movie more appealing than the genre side). The director, Sean Ellis, is English, and in fact has only visited the Philippines once before filming. Despite not knowing the local language, he makes a very intriguing and interesting film.",1407024000,,1205,4.630841121495327
6074179,4,B00GE7IT6K,"METRO MANILA tells a familiar tale of a farmer Oscar Ramirez (Jake Macapagal) and his family coming to Manila to find work, after they are unable to continue their previous lives as farmers.  They find the city to be both corrupt and amoral: Oscar is forced to work as a security guard, while his wife Mai (Althea Vega) works nights in a seedy bar as an hostess.  They try to sustain their basically blameless lives, but find themselves sucked into other people's plans for financial gain.  Eventually Oscar becomes involved in his colleague Douglas Ong's (John Arcilla's) elabroate plot to defraud their employers by faking a robbery.  Needless to say the plan goes wrong, and Oscar is encouraged to depart from the moral straight and narrow with tragic results.  Sean Ellis' film captures the corrupt, breathless life of contemporary Manila through stunning photography, as well as shot-sequences whose cuts blend into one another, creating a nightmarish world that haunts all the city's inhabitants.  ""Good"" and ""evil"" no longer have any real significance for anyone; in a world of unrestrained capitalism, everyone is on the make and out to exploit their fellow human-beings.  Despite his Christian faith, Oscar discovers to his cost that even he cannot remain immune. The action of this film is a little slow to get going, but once it does, it transforms itself into a compelling thriller.  Ellis' camera continually focuses on close-ups of Ramirez's face as he gradually undergoes a rude awakening to the realities of contemporary city life: Macapagal gives a compelling performance as someone sucked against his will into the vortex of corruption.",1401321600,,1654,5.122676579925651
6074180,4,B00GE7IT6K,"To look for a job and better life, a farmer Oscar Ramirez (Jake Macapagal) living in Banaue (province known for the rice terraces you will see in the films opening part), leaves for Manila with his wife Mai (Althea Vega) and two children. In the capital city of the Philippines, however, the family winds up in a slum, without money after being exploited and cheated.

Things get better when Oscar lands a job as a security guard and driver. His partner Ong (John Arcilla) is a nice person, jaded but experienced, giving right advice to Oscar. But Oscar thinks something is not quite right when he notices there is some dark side to this hard-bitten guard, like Denzel Washingtons officer in Training Day. What is he thinking of?

Helmed by British director Sean Ellis (Cashback and The Broken), Metro Manila unfolds like a gritty social drama, and then slowly turns into something different. Without revealing much about the story, I can only say that the UK-Philippines production (in Tagalog) has some crime elements, though the film's focus always stays close to the central figure Oscar, a decent man doing his best for his family.

Shot on the street of Manila, Metro Manila benefits from authentic photography and strong performances from the cast. Part crime drama and part morality tale, the film is a memorable one.",1394841600,4,1325,4.88
6074181,5,B00GE7IT6K,"This is the latest film from British born director Sean Ellis (`Cash Back'). It is set in the Philippine capital Manila - hence the title. We meet Oscar Ramirez who has to leave his farm as it won't pay the bills. He takes his wife Mai and his two daughters and with a few savings heads off to find work n the big, bad city. On arrival he finds out that trust is one character trait he should have left in the village. Desperate for work Mai is soon touting her wares at a seedy bar. Oscar finally gets a job working for a security van company.

What he first thinks is his lucky break soon turns sour when he realises his new partner is not the nice guy he has been pretending to be. What follows is the story of what Oscar is forced to do and a roller coaster of a ride it is.

This film captures some of the horrific poverty that exists in Manila and juxtaposes it with the incredible wealth of some of the inhabitants. The issues can be viewed as universal and that helps gain empathy for all the players - well the nice ones. But you can even see why greed becomes a motivation for erstwhile law abiding people. There is some violence here but it is all incidental. The acting is all excellent and it can be very emotional. It had me glued to the screen for the full 115 minutes. In Tagalog so there is some English and with some very goods sub titles; this one is very easy to recommend.",1394841600,7,1393,4.155555555555556
6074182,5,B00GE7IT6K,"It gives excellent insight into how difficult it is to move up in socioeconomic status in the Philippines (or any developing country) when born into a sustenance living situation. It highlights how there are people who what to help someone do better, people who help if there is a win in it for them too, and others who just take advantage of the disparate, the uneducated, and the naive.  Good people can be driven to do bad things when faced with no alternative.",1394755200,,464,4.590361445783133

6074190,5,B00GE7IT6K,"Hoping to improve their life, put-upon Filipino rice farmer Oscar (Jake Macapagal) moves with his family to Metropolitan Manila, but earning a wage and finding a suitable place to live in the unforgiving city proves much harder than he expects.  At his absolute lowest, with his wife employed at a strip club and his daughter complaining of a painful toothache, fortune smiles on him:  he is hired as an armored-car driver and guard by a transportation company.  For Oscar, the pay and the chance to provide for his loved ones compensates for the danger.  Soon, however, he is drawn into a web of intrigue and violence he never expected, and his station in life is once again threatened.  Metro Manila, winner of several British Independent Film Awards, is a suspense gem.  In regard to its aesthetic and the way its twisty story unfolds, it recalls such hits as Heat and The Raid 2.  Lasting almost two hours, it devotes a significant amount of time to character development, so the audience is truly invested in Oscar and his family and their urban plight by the time the film shifts gear and reveals itself as a heist story.  Shot on location by director Sean Ellis (Cashback), the photography is atmospheric and detailed, perfectly capturing the disparity between the realms of the wealthy and the realms of the impoverished.  And the eventful third act satisfies on the two most important levels:  the resolution is both very exciting and very poignant.",1411171200,2,1458,4.866396761133603
