8558298,5,B00AWBIKNG,"This is one of my favorite walks to start my day. Serene, gentle, it becomes meditative with the song bird sound track, making it a very realistic stroll through mostly forested nature trails. Set the treadmill at 3 mph, and I lose myself in the walk, and 60 minutes, 3 miles, slips by. Feels so good mentally and physically when done. Please do more nature walks!",1476057600,,364,4.53030303030303

8558305,5,B00AWBIKNG,I lived in Ireland as a child.  My grandmother took me to this same location over 50 years ago and we walked this same path together.  It is amazing how this location has never changed and it looks exactly the same as I remembered it.  It brought tears to my eyes just watching it.  I really enjoyed this video.  Very well put together.,1384732800,15,336,4.26984126984127
8558306,5,B00AWBIKNG,I have several of these and for me they are so worth it.  My dream of visiting these places is not going to happen.  I love being able to experience these places while walking on the treadmill.  I feel they are very well done.  They offer you choices of whether to listen to music or the natural sounds.  Options are nice.  This purchase was totally worth it to me.,1367020800,21,365,4.217391304347826
