8744669,1,B019C6X112,"To give everything away... Eric Roberts doesn't appear in the film, just his unconvincing voice as a 600 year old Native American shaman. On an island in the Pacific northwest (Nackpanna?), a construction crew has discovered old burials. A class of students come in to do an evaluation for relocating. The class is missing Brundle who was harassed by the class in black and white bad camera angle flashbacks. He is descendant from the shaman and uses a newly discovered buried scroll in remarkable condition to raise the shaman mummy from the dead and kill those who once locked him in an attic. The mummy had his own music, one that would have been more fitting for a Miami Vice feature. The film consists of students jogging around the island with the mummy staring at them through the woods. Occasionally one succumbs to an ancient Native America steel scythe.

The film didn't have much dialogue. And when it did, it was bad and not delivered well. This could be a ""so bad it is good"" film that was clearly influenced by the likes of Rene Perez and perhaps even 1960's Italian horror.

Guide: No sex or nudity. No swearing. One use of ""effing"" Okay, I am not totally clear on the swearing I started the intermittent FF after an hour, disqualifying myself for a hacker punch.",1475539200,,1278,4.650442477876106
