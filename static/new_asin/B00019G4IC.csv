8008705,5,B00019G4IC,Quite the surprise in that the prints are fairly decent and THE BAT is in widescreen format.  Hard to find FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER is a wonderfully awful movie that was a TV staple at one time and looks OK here.  CARNIVAL OF SOULS looks wonderful and that is amazing in that most PD prints of this are kinda cloudy.  Shame Goodtimes isn't in biz anymore.,1509667200,,354,4.5

The Bat
Horror legend Vincent Price (House of Usher) and OSCAR nominee Agnes Moorehead (The Magnificent Ambersons) star in this suspense thriller based on Mary Roberts Rinehart's oft-filmed novel and stageplay. Mystery writer Cornelia van Gorder (Moorehead) rents a spooky country house for the summer, while the masked criminal called The Bat is on the loose - and Dr. Malcolm Wells (Price) knows more than he's telling.

Carnival Of Souls
Candace Hilligoss (Curse of the Living Corpse) stars as the sole survivor of an automobile accident, who then finds herself trapped between the lands of the living and the dead, in this uniquely effective horror film. Shot in Lawrenceville, Kansas, reportedly for less than $100,000, this cult classic (aka Corridors of Evil) weaves an unforgettable spell, with its haunting score, eerie atmosphere, and surreal, nightmarish imagery.
