8662426,4,B00KX45B0M,"Italy's Mystery Mountains is a technical expos on how Italy, in it's current form, came to be and where it is going.  The DVD goes into fairly technical details that are presented in a way that makes it easy to understand varied topics such as plate tectonics, subduction and the formation of marble.  I've traveled extensively in Italy  and have always been curious about the topography and geology.  After viewing this dvd I now understand how Italy became a mix of Islands volcanoes and mountain ranges. The production qualities, sound and video are a bit below what I expected but nevertheless the information and explanation was excellent.",1515456000,,644,4.990654205607477
8662427,5,B00KX45B0M,"Watched this on television, and bought this so we would have it to watch again - and again. We enjoyed the presentation and the information answered questions that we had wondered about.",1513641600,,186,4.84375
8662428,5,B00KX45B0M,"In viewing this documentary for the second time, I find that the research on Italy's geology is profound.  The country literally arose from under the sea!!  One mountain has ancient seashells as it's decoration.  The program covers the most detail geologists can find.  The photography is stunning and shows you the magic of nature in creating these unusual mountains and the country as a whole.  A great country and profound geology!  Also, this would be wonderful for the classroom.",1494288000,,484,5.063291139240507
8662429,1,B00KX45B0M,Color is muted and washed out.  Image quality is poor.  240p?,1486598400,,61,4.454545454545454
8662430,4,B00KX45B0M,"This is an interesting and very enlightening 60 minute lecture with visuals of Italy addressing the question: Are the mountains of Italy still growing?
The film shows the findings of various geologists in different fields looking at different objects that lead the scientists to the conclusion that the mountains are slowly getting higher because they are being pushed up from below, from the depths of the sea, from moving plates in the sea. We also learn how Italy itself was formed because of the movement of the plates.
Unfortunately, much of the language used is not clear to people who are unfamiliar with geological terms. For example: What are plates? What causes them to move?
Nevertheless, although an average person will not be able to understand all, he and she will get a general feeling that the earth is changing its form,",1466899200,,837,4.901408450704225
8662431,5,B00KX45B0M,"Interesting geologic story of Italy - why are there: Tuscan Hills? , the Alps?, Vesuvius, Pompeii, and other volcanos? Italy was part of North Africa before the Mediterranean opened. Scenery is fantastic, great guide to towns and villages of Italy.",1438992000,,248,5.225
8662432,1,B00KX45B0M,"I only viewed part of this video, it stopped working and I could not get it to restart. There seems to be know one to contact when you have a problem and no way to get your money back",1413417600,,183,3.717948717948718
8662433,5,B00KX45B0M,"Excellent documentary on the geography, plate tectonic and vulcanism that have created the peninsula of Italy over the course of millions of years.  The beautiful images of the marbleized mountains that were used by the great Renaissance sculptors like Michael Angelo among others, helped create the history and beauty of what we see in historic Italy today.

Even better is the price, HD is the same price as SD so it is well worth it to see this gorgeous documentary in dazzling HD.  Highly recommend to those who have a strong interest in understanding plate tectonics, and want to know and understand more of how Italy got its unique shape and how the mountains were created throughout Italy.",1413158400,2,696,4.88135593220339
