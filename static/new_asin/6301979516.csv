403856,5,6301979516,"In his portrayal of a journeyman pugilist in Homeboy, Mickey Rourke approaches perfection as a character actor.  His implementation of subtle affectation (slurred speech, shuffling gate, slight facial contortion) coupled with an exceptional script result in a perfect rendering of the over-damaged boxer, Johnny Walker.  The film follows Walker's misguided and abortive return to boxing, and the two characters he slowly gravitates towards...his affable but exploitative manager, expertly played by Christopher Walken, and the unassuming and subtly beautiful carnival worker who becomes his romantic interest played by Debra Feuer.
The boxing sequences in the film are exquisitely realistic, and are a notable contrast to the 120 punches/round with 90% connection type that litter the average boxing film.  Rourke's experience as a four-round light-heavyweight is invaluable here, as the natural rhythms of an experienced boxer are expertly captured without the amateurishness that non-boxing actors invariably display.  The film transcends the boxing movie genre by providing truly engrossing character studies in concert with the action sequences.  Walken's anti-hero character is a compelling fusion of conflicting components.  Feuer's solitary character slowly becomes more accessible and identifiable as the film progresses.  Her relationship with Johnny is especially notable in its tangible sincerity and its contrasting lack of the usual carnal component.
The ensemble cast is superb, especially Ruben Blades as a back alley physician.  Clapton's score is excellent.  Michael Seresin captures the gritty Blue Horizon-type boxing atmosphere admirably.  The film is absolutely without equal in its genre.",992822400,6,1710,6.0

403986,3,6301979516,"Mickey Rourke wrote this film, even though it is not his name (it's a name he uses often). Debra Feuer (who was married to Rourke at the time) blew me away in ""To Live and Die in L.A."" (1985), starring Willem Dafoe and William Peterson. She was cast as Dafoe's lover. Although it was panned by critics, that is one of my favorite William Friedken films, and (true to form) has a fantastic car chase scene. Christopher Walken is still going strong today. I  think he is one of America's best actors, even though he is usually typecast, he can and has played all types of roles. Besides his Academy Award winning role in ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978), one of my favorite films he made was ""King of New York"" (1989), directed by the brilliant Abel Ferrara, whose extremely controversial next film was ""Bad Lieutenant "" (1990). It is one of my all-time favorites. Because of it's NC-17 rating, distribution was severely limited. I saw it opening night at The Angelica Theatre, one of a handful of independent film outlets in NYC (I went 3 nights in a row, taking everyone I knew. Even there, I saw dozens of people leave, I assume because of the deviant nature of the role. Although not pornographic, it is definitely a hard film to watch-but well worth it. I believe Harvey Keitel's performance is without a doubt the best he ever did. Martin Scorcese said it was the best American film of the decade (1990-2000). I agree. Please pardon my digression. As far as this film, look closely at some of the small bit parts; you will recognize in some actors in their earliest roles, which I love to do. It is an okay film; certainly nothing like ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"" (1984). Definitely give it a look!",1443398400,,1698,4.549019607843137

404041,5,6301979516,"I bought this movie at the lowest, most depresed time of my life . It was the worst choice I could have made . He is a good guy with a lot of heart , but never gets a break . There are some spiritual overtones in the movie that most people don't pick up on . He looks up on the bridge in the rain, as if to say ""what more do you expect from me"" , He looks at the statue of St Jude (patron saint of the hopeless) with curiosity and sadness. Cris Walkens charicter is a waste but he seems to get a break of luck at every turn . At the end he is given a choice of two roads to follow , fight cotton, or rob a jewelry store with Walken . he faces death either way. As he is being beaten to death in the ring by cotton he still won't go down . There are flash scenes of Walken , the robery, and Johnny  in the ring  back and forth until it's time for both of them to face death . somebody ""up there"" gives Johnny a break. The ending gave me enough hope to go on with my life . It is a dark drab movie with a sound track to match . The acting, casting, script, and soundtrack were top notch . It's one of my favorite movies of all time for many reasons. Thank You Mickey Rourke!",1392508800,,1172,3.721774193548387

404088,1,6301979516,"I guess you either love Mickey Rourke's acting or dislike it intensely. I fall into the latter category, and for me this was just another piece of Mickey Rourke drivel. From the description of the film we find out that Rourke plays a washed-up boxer, but who knew until about midway through the film, when a doctor says that if he were younger he'd tell him to find another job? There's no telling his age from his looks and manners, and since we are given no background about the character, we have no idea what part of his life we are being thrust into, why he's got this attitude (punching his opponents after the bell or after what is supposed to be a clean break), so it's awfully difficult to sympathized or connect with the character in any way. The subplot with Christopher Walken is totally irrelevant, which is too bad, since Walken is the only one on screen who shows any signs of energy and acting ability (though his club routine is very painful to watch). There is no chemistry between Rourke and his ""romantic interest""...hell, there's no chemistry at all between Rourke and ANYONE on screen; he acts throughout as though he were the only one on camera (not atypical for Rourke movies in general when he is the lead). There are so many better boxing films out there (Raging Bull, Champion, Body And Soul, just to name a few), so don't waste your time on this one unless you are a Mickey Rourke fan.",1340582400,,1413,4.501945525291829
404089,4,6301979516,"Other reviewers have referred to this as a boxing movie. Though boxing is a large part of it, I would consider it more of a character study.

Here's the scoop. Mickey Rourke is Johnny Walker, a punch drunk club boxer who heads to Atlantic City to pick up a couple of fights. Chris Walken, a small time hood on parole, takes an interest in Johnny and thinks they can do good things together. Johnny takes a liking to a young lady who owns a broken down carnival. Can these people find what they're looking for?

These are some interesting characters. One could consider Rourke an innocent. He can't talk to women. He doesn't know what a Jew is. He acts out impulsively. He's like a little kid, but he hopes to win a big fight. Walken thinks he's bigger than he is. He dresses garishly. Has a crappy singing act he performs in a strip club. But he wants bigger and better things and wants to make a big score. The young girl just wants to return the carnival to it's former glory and see it as she remembered it as a kid. This is a bleak existence set in an ugly town. It shows the boxing game as brutal and uncaring. Most of the people involved are bottom feeders using humans as ash trays.

It's directed and acted well. Rourke is very good and has very few lines. It's all in his look and body language. This was not an easy role to pull off. Walken is....well....Walken. I like him but you've seen this before. The other characters do a stand-up job. Many have noted the music score by Eric Clapton and Mark Kamen. It is outstanding. It just fits right in. Some might question the ending. There's much to question, but I can't say I didn't like it.

I don't want to say this is a great movie. It's a very singular vision. But it's well worth seeing.",1336176000,,1751,4.296969696969697
404090,5,6301979516,"This is a great movie about the lower end of boxing and the how these guys try to get by even if it means risking their well-being.  Rourke's performance as Johnny Walker is inspiring and a precursor to his portrayal of Randy the Ram in the Wrestler.  such and underrated movie, and is Rourke's first screenplay which deserves to be recognized.  the soundtrack is an unreal job by Eric Clapton and perfectly helps the movie's character.  great to watch for any boxing fan and anyone who is a fan of the wrestler.",1331164800,2,512,4.532608695652174

404092,2,6301979516,"Being a big fan of Rourke, Walken and Polito, I bought this dvd in hopes that it would be a gritty and interesting watch. Unfortunately I was less than impressed with this low-budget affair. First off, the audio and picture transfer are woeful on this dvd. The quality is equal to that of a VHS recording- the presentation is cheap in every respect. But how was the actual movie?
Well, it becomes pretty apparent early on that this is a film content with moving only through the low gears. Mickey Rourke does a very odd thing here... He pulls a face throughout the movie that is very strange indeed. He actually looks like a stroke victim, and the effect on the viewer is a little disconcerting. My wife kept laughing throughout, saying, ""What the hell is he doing with his face?"" I was asking the same thing.
Mickey Rourke plays Johnny Walker- a washed-up, punchdrunk fighter nearing the end of his career. He doesn't say much, but when he does he comes across more like Mickey Dork than Mickey Rourke... ""What are Granny Smith's? What does Jewish mean?"" He is so simple it is laughable- a case of the writer laying it on a little thick (Excuse the pun).
Christopher Walken plays it mostly for laughs, like he knows he is in a terrible movie and is just happy to be getting paid. His little cabaret act really needs to be seen to be believed. It surely must be the nadir of Walken's patchy career. The love-interest is so bland and wooden as to be completely forgettable. Polito is criminally underused. The score by Eric Clapton is cheesy and unexciting. The fight scenes are a lot more realistic than Rocky but the blocking is so bad that you can see that no punch ever really lands. Also, the fights are very unexciting.
If you want to see Rourke play a washed-up sportsman then go and watch The Wrestler. I hate to be predictable and say that, but at least that film is well-written and brilliant directed by Aranofsky. This in comparison is just a lumpen mess- a bit like Rourke's once beautiful face.",1282521600,2,2007,4.53168044077135
404093,3,6301979516,"This film is somewhat formulaic in that it
tries to balance the good and the bad amongst
our protagonist.
Unfortunately our ""hero"" is a man of few words.
He instead is allowed to let a shrug, or distant
look to take the place of dialogue.  Personally,
this does not do it for me.
The side story with Christopher Walken is weak
and does not add to the story in a significant way.
Personally, I am considering offering this DVD to
my local library, though I'll probably give it one
more viewing for good luck.",1278633600,2,507,4.3936170212765955

404135,1,6301979516,"It's no contest: ""Homeboy"" is a terrible movie.  Which is really sad to say because it had so much potential.  Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken?  Musical score by Eric Clapton?  How could it miss?  Okay, the script is awful and Mickey must take the blame for this because he wrote it.  Mickey's character says about three lines in the first 45 minutes of the movie so it is extremely hard to understand him or, worse, care about him.  Walken brings his trademark quirkiness to his role but he is stuck doing an exruciating stage act in a seedy strip joint, among other things.  You would think that Mickey Rourke would have a lot to say about boxing in this movie, given his ring experience.  But this movie isn't about boxing at all.  By the last third of the movie, some mildly interesting things are going on: a budding romance (the actress was Mickey's wife at the time), a plan for a heist, a boxing match thrown in for some reason.  With a better script and a better director, this movie could have been a contender.  As it is, it doesn't make it out of the first round.  This movie is only for die-hard fans of Mickey, Walken and Eric Clapton, the only ones who will have any reason to sit through it until the final bell.",1254873600,8,1233,4.402654867256637
404136,5,6301979516,"This film may not be everyone's cup-of-tea, but I highly reccomend it.  Sure, its dark and painful but it also shows a moment of light coming to a broken soul. Mickey Rourke's performance is incredibly risky and unusual. He plays an aging alcoholic, possibly brain damaged boxer who's practically mute.  Rourke wrote the screen play (under the name, Eddie Cook) but the lead character he portrays has probably no more than a page of dialogue - he's able to deliver a heartbreaking perfomance almost solely through his incredible physical presence. This is the performance that Bob Dylan raved about in his book ""Chronicles"" and although it ended up being nothing like what I imagined, it is so profoundly moving and poetic that its continued to haunt me. I found it even better on the second viewing.  Like, ""The Wrestler"" it draws certain elements from Rourke's life (in this case, his childhood) but its also quite different in how it achieves its effect.  If one expects to see the Rourke charm as displayed in ""The Pope Of Greenwich Village"" or even in ""The Wrestler"" one may be disappointed. ""Homeboy"" is about a character almost totally cut off from the world. I've heard people say its filled with boxing cliches but the reality is that it takes those cliches and turns them on their head. There's no struggle for respect or redemption with cheering crowds and triumphant music.  This film is like a blues and thats one reason that Eric Clapton's soulful score works so well.
