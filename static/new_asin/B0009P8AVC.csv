2308458,5,B0009P8AVC,"I purchased this video for my nieces and nephews to turn them on to yoga.  Boy, was that a good move.  They love the exercises and sing along with the music.  Now they have their friends over to do their 'yogi' exercise a couple of times a week.
It is like having a free baby sitter sitting in a box!!!",1074038400,,302,4.0
2308459,5,B0009P8AVC,"My 6-year-old daughter recently received the Little Yogis tape as a gift, and she has been hooked ever since!  We watch the tape and do the poses together as a workout, and she also watches the tape every night before she goes to bed - she really enjoys all the little songs and mini-video clips in between each pose.  When we do the workout together, she really gets into it, instructing me on how to do the poses the right way!  She is also learning about the health benefits of doing yoga and staying healthy, and is very inspired by how fun Wai Lana makes it to learn about health.",1072656000,,585,4.3
2308460,5,B0009P8AVC,"My kids adore this video. It's so relaxing and it's fun too. Wai Lana instructs kids how to do all sorts of yoga poses, things like the Lion (kids even get to roar!), Making Cake (a stirring the cake batter activity), and more. Of course I've heard about yoga (who hasn't?) but never tried it myself. Doing some of the poses along with my kids has inspired me to try more. This is an amazing video that teaches children how to be more coordinated and concerned about their body health. Very recommended!!",1068422400,,504,4.489130434782608
2308461,5,B0009P8AVC,"Wai Lana is well known as expert at teaching yoga through videotapes and public tv series. The series is for adults and can give experienced practitioners a challenging hour.
In the Little Yogi's video she applies her knowledge of yoga moves and how the body works, to helping kiddies enjoy the pleasures of yoga.
There is also a complete kit for gift-giving that includes the video, a decorated yoga mat, a cool chart of poses and a CD of music.",1062115200,,446,4.5875
8064645,5,B0009P8AVC,Wai Lana's voice is kinda creepy but the kids love it.  We do Wai Lana Yoga in a special needs classroom,1433721600,,104,3.9523809523809526
8064646,5,B0009P8AVC,"I am not sure how "" yoga"" this is, ther are not movements required for  child to do in this video, but lay and relax, and breathe, and breathe... ""a-la-shavasana"" thing ,adopted for early age child, but if you are looking for something soothing , that may calm down a child, or even adult, then you may want to  give it a try. Yes, You can simply get some calming music for the same purpose, but this DVD gives relaxing video  to support relaxation. If your child is visual type,this may work way better. Also, Myself I find Lana's voice sounding quiet pleasant.",1354579200,,562,4.436893203883495
8064647,4,B0009P8AVC,"Our daughter's OT suggested getting kids' yoga DVD to help her stretch and to calm her down when she gets overstimulated.  This is a cute DVD and she loves doing the exercises.  It does help her and I can do it with her, which is great.  She'll even do it by herself.",1353715200,,267,4.096153846153846
8064648,5,B0009P8AVC,I liked it a lot and my kid enjoys all the songs and love to imitate what Wai Lana and the other kids do.,1280102400,,105,3.4166666666666665
8064649,3,B0009P8AVC,"I got this tape for $1 at my local dollar store, and I'm glad I didn't pay more.  I would say it's not worth much more than five.

The good points are that it's colorful, and the animation and songs are pretty decent.  But the instructor often spends way too much time talking about the poses, rather than just getting into them.  It's too long for kids to wait.  Also, I find the instructor's voice very.....odd.  I know it's supposed to be 'soothing', but I find it weird.  It's rather deep.  It sounds to me like a man's voice trying to be a woman's voice.  (If you've ever seen Transamerica, you'll know what I mean.)

I don't think my kids will use this as it's intended, as it's pretty slow.  I know yoga isn't about speed, but kids aren't generally about meditation and excessive patience.  If it went more directly into getting the kids into the poses, it would be better, in my opinion.",1177286400,,895,4.390243902439025
8064650,4,B0009P8AVC,"This is a nice starting yoga DVD for young kids. I just wish it was a little bit longer. There's also one young little girl in the back in red who doesn't always do the pose they are working on and I find her distracting -- she's not the one I want my toddler copying.

The poses are:

Balloon Breathing

Butterfly

Cat and Dog Stretch

Rocking Beetle

Cobra

Lion

Mountain

Tree

Bridge

Jelly Legs

Daydream Pose

My toddler does enjoy the cartoon of the poses followed by the kids doing it. It's very similar to ""Yoga Kids: ABC's"" by Marsha Wenig. If you like ""Little Yogi's"" then ""Yoga Kid's: ABC's"" would be the next stop since it is also a little cartoon followed by the pose but since it goes throughout the alphabet, it is longer.",1161216000,,739,4.345588235294118
8064651,5,B0009P8AVC,"Little Yogis is a charming and fun yoga video.  Some friends got it for their three kids, and all the kids have fun doing yoga with it.  The 5 year old boy loves it so much he gets his own mat out to do it by himself.  The beautiful scenery, happy music, and smiling Wai Lana make this kid yoga video exceptional.  I've seen a couple of other kiddie yoga videos, and this is so much better I highly recommend it. I'm going to get it for my grandchildren.",1075939200,,454,4.067415730337078
8064652,5,B0009P8AVC,A friend bought the Little Yogis video for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and I really enjoy watching it too. Such a sweet way to entertain and educate kids. There should be more like this. I thought it was the best.,1074297600,,225,4.255813953488372
