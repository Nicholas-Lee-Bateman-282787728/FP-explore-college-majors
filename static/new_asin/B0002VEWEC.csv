2125355,1,B0002VEWEC,"Expectations for this movie were low. Carmen Electra, bad stop motion animated monsters, juvenile story. Still, even going into it with low expectations, this movie was worse than I could have imagined. Take the very worst episode of ""Land of the Lost"" that you ever saw. Make the effects worse (yes, worse than Grumpy the Dinosaur). Now put Carmen Electra into it. There you go, that's Monster Island.

There are cave men, giant insects and a sleestack. Actually, I think the sleestack is supposed to be a Pirahna-Man, but it looked like a sleestack to me. I used to like ""Land of the Lost"" when I was 5 years old, but I have a feeling that even 5 year olds would find this movie insulting.",1120003200,,691,4.528
2125356,2,B0002VEWEC,"[IN FACT 2.5 STARS]  If you find a MTV movie with Carmen Electra playing herself, called 'Monster Island,' you know you  cannot take it seriously.  When it is made with unknown actors, and directed by the person whose previous work is 'Wild Things 2,' you just don't expect too much.  Surprisingly, however, 'Monster island' is not all bad; in fact, acting is fairly good, and if you get what the film is trying to do, the cheesy special effects would not be a big embarrassment.

'Monster Island' is not a horror; it's more like a parody of those B-films made in the 50s, which featured big bugs or monsters that attack humans.  In this MTV version, the characters come to an isolated island somewhere in the ocean (near that famous mysterious triangle, maybe).  They have a party and concert (of Carmen Electra), but a red big ant-like bug makes a havoc there, and it snatches Carmen and flies away to the mountain.

Now it's the time for the stock characters to rescue her, including Josh and his ex-girlfriend Maddy, followed by opportunist TV crew thinking that this is going to be a reality TV show (how about 'Survivors'?).  Their adventures include several fights against bugs, and an encounter with a strange scientist played by Adam West.  La La Vasquez and Nick Carter appear as themselves, but the time allotted to them is too short.

As the name of Adam West's character suggests (he is called Dr. Harryhausen), the film is partly a tribute to old-fashioned monster flicks, as 'Spy Kids 2' is.  The monsters are of cheap, cheesy kind, low-tech fake creatures powered by humans hiding outside the frame of the camera.

Though there are some funny moments, and actors are doing good jobs (considering the low-budget situation), the film lacks brio that would have made it more enjoyable.  Another director like Robert Rodriguez would have imbued energy into the ordinary story, but here Jack Perez directs everything in an autopilot fashion, missing every opportunity to liven the whole things up.  When a certain green 'thing' comes up from a swamp, it is a good chance to do some comedy, or something.  However, 'Monster Island' lets the great chance slip away, only showing a feebly done, not-so-funny set-piece.

Intentionally made cheesy and corny, 'Monster Island' might be a good choice if you have nothing to do.  Otherwsie, you might skip it, and watch much better 'Eight Legged Freak' instead.",1118707200,2,2414,4.860635696821516
2125357,4,B0002VEWEC,"Produced by MTV Movies, MONSTER ISLAND is an affectionately campy tribute to those big bug movies of the fifties.  Carmen Electra serves as nothing more than a lovely prop to inspire a sincere nerd and his friends to come to her rescue after she is abducted by the queen ant of a humongous ant colony.  With a giant spider, an amphibious aquaman and two giant praying mantises along for the ride, the movie is just what you would expect.  Bad special effects, terrible acting, and one silly sequence after another.  But with Adam West along as the heroic Dr. Harryhausen (a tribute to Ray for sure), the movie should please fans of both those cheesy old movies and unmitigated camp.",1117324800,2,682,4.658333333333333
2125358,1,B0002VEWEC,"Carmen, Carmen, Carmen.  What were you thinking?  I am a big fan of cheese movies, big bug movies, and my personal fave, nature-run-amok flicks.  The problem here is despite a wonderfully campy performance by Adam West (can he give any other type?) this is too bad and tries to hard to achieve cult status.  One can not make a cult movie on purpose, and took itself to seriously to be campy.  The special effects aren't special, the acting is non-existant, the plot is looser than Carmen's bra, and I've seen better direction on a bubble gum commercial.  Please!  I want to sue the producers to get back my 90 minutes.",1099353600,8,618,4.5636363636363635

2125381,4,B0002VEWEC,"This MTV made-for-TV movie manages to recapture some of the magic from the glory years of campy monster movies, complete with old school stop-motion photography visual effects.  I'm not sure if stop-motion king Ray Harryhausen would be proud, but Monster Island is obviously (especially given the presence of a character named Dr. Harryhausen) a tribute of sorts to his work.  When I say this movie is campy, I mean it is overtly campy, with no attempt to hide the fact that models were relied upon heavily in many, many scenes.  The kids today, not having seen this type of special effects before, are bound to ridicule it mercilessly, but Monster Island is a real treat for those of us who appreciate the history of the craft.  The ridiculous story is played for laughs all the way through, and the end result is a surprisingly good comedy.

Poor Josh (Daniel Letterle) is so depressed over losing his girlfriend Maddy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to the biggest poser in school that he can't even get excited over winning a free trip from MTV for his entire senior class to enjoy a Carmen Electra show on a lush, tropical island.  OK, so he's miffed his sister Jen (Chelan Simmons) registered for it in his name, but good grief, man, we're talking about the chance to meet Carmen Electra here.  Everyone else is stoked, naturally.  So they get to the island (which just so happens to be located in the Bermuda Triangle) and even Josh is starting to enjoy himself, when - wouldn't you know it? - a giant insect swoops down and carries Carmen off to the top of a mountain.  Not being the type of guy who takes the insectoid theft of a hot babe lying down, Josh organizes his friends into a search party and heads off into the jungle to rescue Carmen.  Maddy and her beaux come along for the ride once Mr. Wonderful sees that MTV is sending a two-man crew to cover the rescue effort.  These crazy kids soon find themselves on an adventure right out of Land of the Lost (and I'm talking the original TV series), evading gigantic Praying Mantis creatures, giant spiders, huge soldier ants, and an ill-tempered Piranha Man along the way.  Things get even weirder once they meet up with the eccentric Dr. Harryhausen (Adam West, who knows all about campy acting).

How can you not love a film like this?  It never pretends to be anything more than cheap, cheesy, campy, and patently ridiculous fun, and that is exactly what it delivers.  Plus Carmen Electra and Adam West.  If you ask me, that makes for a pretty potent recipe for good times.",1310428800,5,2535,4.612472160356347
2125382,3,B0002VEWEC,"Jack Perez's Monster Island is ninety minutes of parody.  The old monster movies are given a royal treatment in a story set in the MTV venue.

Carmen Electra plays herself as the hapless heroine kidnapped by the Queen Ant for nefarious purposes.  In other words, you have to keep your native slaves happy to maintain the hive at optimal health.

You have your assortment of high schoolers.  The talented Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays the usual object of affection by two seniors.  However, when she picks up an amulet and becomes the island goddess of the enslaved natives in the bee hive, she takes on the persona of Xena: Warrior Princess.

Adam West, 60's TV's Batman, plays Dr. Ray Harryhausen, the last survivor of a doomed group of scientists playing God with radioactive experiments on animal life. For the younger generation, the real Ray Harryhausen was a writer, director, special effects wizard and producer for some of the great sci-fi movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's.

There is a plus to this film.  The island scenery was actually filmed in British Columbia.

If you want to have a laugh, grab a bowl of buttery cheese popcorn and relive some bad special effects with a story about as bad.  Hey!  This is one way to get away from your troubles for ninety minutes.",1255737600,,1279,4.711711711711712

This is this first movie I ever saw Mary Elizabeth Winstead in and one of the main reasons I bought this DVD. Adam West has a turn as a ""mad scientist"". He does a good job of it.",1191715200,5,322,3.893939393939394
2125385,2,B0002VEWEC,"Being like a Harryhausen film I expected at least 5 monsters. There were 2 stop motion types (tho 2 of one and a few of the other), and a dumb creature from the monster lagoon (ohh not again).

Ohh, plus one dummy spider for 1.5 seconds that doesn't move.

  The stop motion is as good as any.

  You can see from the clips in the behind the scenes it is cropped from the original widescreen! What a mistake for an effects intravoganza (or any DVD unless having 2 versions).

2125386,4,B0002VEWEC,"This MTV made for TV movie is a tribute to stop-motion master Ray Harryhausen.  Adam West even plays a mad scientist by the name of Harryhausen.  The action centers around an MTV concert by Carmen Electra held on a small tropical island.  Things get bad when a giant flying insect grabs Carmen and flies off with her.  While some believe Carmen is now beyond hope, a small group of teens decide that any hope is worth pursuing and they set off to rescue the pop singer.

The giant insect is not the only monster on the island and we are treated to giant preying mantises, a giant spider, giant ants, a gill man, and even a predatory fungus with a dash of horseshoe crab.  All must be overcome in order to rescue Carmen Electra.

As a tribute, this movie works quite well.  The plot is a little weak but rather typical for movies targeting the same audience.  I was a little surprised that MTV made this film and made the MTV personnel act like jerks.  Definitely not their best job at self promotion but a great effort at stop motion animation.  Some DVD extras take you behind the scenes to show just what is involved in making a stop motion extravaganza.  If you like giant bugs and monsters then this is a film to watch.",1130803200,6,1223,4.386666666666667
2125387,4,B0002VEWEC,"The Bug was super-scary.  I guess this was the real live reality show cause it almost killed poor Carmen when she was singing her cool rocking song.  I don't think that I would be brave enough to be on a reality show like this...  I think I could do something on Survivor, but not on Monster Island.

I never knew there were so many real monster in the world.  I thought that King Arthur and Jesus killed most of them, except for Big Foot, of course.

My only thing about it was that that real cool dude, Carmen's rocking husband dude from some band in the 80's wasn't in this movie.  The MTV said they were getting married on this show?!?  But I did get up to pee once so I guess that I could have missed it, but I don't think that they could have gotten married where they had poor sweet Carmen captured.  She looked really smoking and sexy sexy sexy in this movie.  That is the most important thing!!!",1123977600,,904,4.203488372093023

8032917,4,B0002VEWEC,"""Monster Island"" is worth a look if you're interested in a ludicrously campy flashback to giant bug movies of the 1950s and 1960s, but updated for the MTV generation. The cast is headlined by the late, great Adam West, Carmen Electra, and former Backstreet Boy Nick Carter, though Daniel Letterle as Josh and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Maddy are the main sources of drama. The setup is that a high school class wins a trip to an island in the Bermuda Triangle (!) to see Carmen Electra, and the stereotypes fly. Carmen begins her awful concert (sponsored by MTV...you remember: the network that formerly showed music videos?) and her concert is immediately interrupted by a 25-foot long red-eyed flying ant, which totes Carmen away in its hideous mandibles. This is worth the price of the movie by itself.

An electrical storm cuts all power and communications from the island, so the resourceful teens are on their own. Josh turns from shy introvert to powerful and popular leader, and a small and loyal cadre attempts to rescue Carmen. Maddy (Josh's ex-girlfriend) drags her bloviating politician of a new boyfriend, Chase (Chris Harrison), with them to help Josh. MTV is there to film it all (hey, it's better than most of their shows nowadays), and please be sure not to miss the hilarious scene where the MTV camera operator blathers on about journalistic integrity! Also note the giant praying mantis (Who knew that praying mantises can't swim? But they can fly, right...?) In the middle of all this Chase goes fishing and hooks something that looks like it's half Sleestak and half Creature From the Black Lagoon. Adam West saves the kids from the Sleestak with a shotgun. In the film's most amusing nod to cinema history, West is playing Dr. Harryhausen from the Department of Atomic Energy. (Be sure to watch the extras to learn about the Harryhausenesque stop-motion techniques used in this film.)

After we see Adam West give a hilarious soliloquy on dirty dishes, he introduces his pet fungus, Rudy, which immediately attacks Josh's awful little sister. Rudy is a genetic cross between a predatory fungus and a horseshoe crab, and he's in heat, which explains the aggression. It's clear that Adam has been isolated too long and is going bonkers, but he reveals that the kids have to escape because the island is going to sink! Maddy suddenly becomes a shaman or something because of a necklace she found in the forest. (""My heart! It beats of the ancient drums!"") After the Bulldozer vs. Praying Mantis smackdown, Chase is revealed to be the coward we all knew he'd turn out to be and Maddy breaks up with him, seriously intoning this ripe passage of dialogue: ""I sever all ties with you! Speak to me no more!""

After the development of some extremely humorous improvised weapons, the bad guys (i.e. Chase and the conniving MTV camerawoman) try to flee, but end up in a web of deceit, complete with hilarious spider. It turns out the entire mountain is a giant anthill, and the Queen Ant (the flying one) has human slaves to gather giant fruit for the ant colony. Adam and the good kids are on a mission to hunt her down, and discover that Carmen is fine but is being forced to sing against her will to control the slaves! Because Maddy found the necklace it turns out she's the queen of the human slaves. She's a fierce warrior who can suddenly speak their totally invented native language, and inspires the revolution against the ants and a war of karate vs. pincers ensues.

The rescue boat is as funny as anything else in the movie, and although Adam West heroically sacrifices himself blowing up the Queen Ant, he gives his pet fungus to a girl to be rescued with the good kids. Fortunately Nick Carter's helicopter just happens to get lost (it is the Bermuda Triangle after all) and finds and rescues them all! Just as the island explodes, Carmen Electra cuddles with the fungus, making this one of the greatest endings in film history.

The special features are worth watching. The trailer is OK, but ""The Magic of Monster Island"" is very good. There are excellent discussions of the stop-motion and puppetry methods used to capture the authentic monster movie feel, which made me appreciate the movie more for what they were trying to do than the sum product of the film itself. There are also some interviews. Adam West's interview is fun, Carmen Electra's is merely OK, and writer/director Jack Perez is very interesting as he discusses the old '50s monster movies this is a lighthearted homage to.

""Monster Island"" isn't a record-breaking work of art by any means, but it does have its own unique charm: it's campy, thematically true to the genre, uses great non-CGI effects liberally, and is just fun to watch. If you're a fan of the giant creatures genre of 1950s sci-fi, this is a pleasant way to spend an evening.",1501113600,4,4841,4.757142857142857

8032919,2,B0002VEWEC,"This is a movie almost completely without merit.  The young lead actor, Daniel Letterle, in addition to having a stupid haircut, has no charisma whatsoever; in fact, he has anti-charisma; the first time you see him on-screen, you want to punch him in the nose--and if anything, you feel more hostile toward him by the end of the movie.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead is attractive, and may have talent, but you couldn't tell it from the wretched dialog she's saddled with; and Carmen Electra is, as usual, a big hole in the screen.
The only good things about this movie are the special effects for the giant mantises, which seem to be computer animation designed to mimic stop-motion, and Adam West's quirky and charming delivery of an enormous dose of exposition at about the thirty-minute mark.
My advice is to fast-forward to Adam West and the mantises--and don't worry that you're missing anything worthwhile by so doing.",1460160000,,919,4.884615384615385

8032924,5,B0002VEWEC,"Released to TV in 2004, ""Monster Island"" is a fun, campy adventure with intentionally bad non-special effects that combines elements of movies like 1961's ""Mysterious Island,"" ""King Kong,"" ""The Land that Time Forgot"" and ""Scooby-Doo"" (but without the dog); it pokes fun at the stop-motion effects from decades ago and even has a character named after stop-motion guru Ray Harryhausen, played by Adam West.

I'm surprised at the bad reviews, which shows these people didn't ""get it,"" because ""Monster Island"" delivers the goods in practically every department. For one, the adventure story works even though it's obviously not to be taken too serious; it's just serious enough. Secondly, the cast is great, which includes an excellent assortment of women -- cutie Chelan Simmons, blond dancer Jana Berengel, Carmen Electra, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, etc. And, thirdly, a notable score and soundtrack (including the main song ""Jungle Fever"" sung by Carmen). Really, everything just clicks for a highly entertaining, fun adventure movie.

Around the mid-point of the flick I realized that I had stumbled on to something special with the introduction of Dr. Harryhausen's ugly-but-cute pet Rudy and the subsequent nigh-moving scene between Dr. Harryhausen and Maddy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). The way Maddy starts to morph into the queen (or goddess) of the Matambas due to the tribal necklace is another highlight.

Some might argue that it's crazy to give a film like ""Monster Island"" such a high rating, but I'm grading it according to what it is and what it aspires to achieve. ""Monster Island"" is a campy TV-movie with intentionally bad F/X and a fun adventure story, which is taken just serious enough. With this in mind, it's superlative on practically every level and, in my opinion, is more entertaining than ""Goonies,"" the two ""Scooby-Doo"" movies, ""At the Earth's Core"" (which isn't saying much, lol) and even ""Star Wars"" (yes, there are some Star Wars elements). In other words, I'd happily watch ""Monster Island"" before any of these five movies.

The film was shot in British Columbia and runs 92 minutes.
