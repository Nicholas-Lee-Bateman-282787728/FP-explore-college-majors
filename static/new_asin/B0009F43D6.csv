2288648,5,B0009F43D6,"I love boy meets world! This the season were topanga, and Cory became boyfriend and Girlfriend, and also the season were they kept breaking up, the first time was when Cory and topanga were on a date, and Cory told her he loved her she avoid him for a couple of days and dumped him because she was scared, It had  scratching my head in confusion, she did the exact opposite of what girls do when you tell them you love them, but they ended up getting backed together at the end of the episode, And another time when they decided to go to another school's dance, and pretended to be other people. Cory pretend to be Shawn and Topanga a French girl, up until they see each other and argue about how they wasn't thier selves and the spark in thier relationship went out! Then the moment you think thier going to breakup, and Cory say's were not breaking up, but they breakup anyway know that they still love each other was just crazy, but they did ended up getting back together before season ended. R.I.P to Britney Murphy,aka trinny topanga best friend in season 3. Not my favorite season but it boy meets world, highly recommend.",1472169600,,1129,4.427884615384615

I've been buying a couple seasons at a time since they loved season 1 so much. My 9 year old watches 1-3 repeatedly so I know he will love it to the end and be sad once season 7 ends as much as I did.

The episode about ""the Rave"" is worth buying alone as it was shot in 1995 with the Monkees ( sans Mike) as guests stars and at the end they perform 2 non-Monkee oldies ( ""My Girl"" is one of them). Great to see these guys again 30 years later from their series. They hadn't lost a step!",1432857600,,299,4.084745762711864
2288671,5,B0009F43D6,"Since I started Boy Meets World late in its run, Ive been waiting for these early seasons to officially start Cory and Topanga dating.  Thats one of the major storylines of the delightful season 3, and there are plenty of laughs to be had over the course of the season.

In the very first episode of the season, its the first day back at school and Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) has decided its time to ask out Topanga Lawrence (Danielle Fishel).  However, he cant quite work up the nerve, so his best friend Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong) steps in in a most unusual way.  Over the course of the season, they deal with the rocky road of being a couple, including what happens when one of them says I love you, dealing with another girl coming on to Cory, loyalties to friends versus each other, and trying to create a great first New Years together.

Of course, thats not the only thing happening this season.  Corys older brother Eric (Will Friedle) is graduating from high school and trying to get into a college with some help from Mr. Feeny (William Daniels).  In pursuit of that, Eric lands an internship at a local TV station.  Shawn is living with their English teacher, Jonathan Turner (Anthony Tyler Quinn), while his dad searching the country for him mom, and the two of them need to navigate their new relationship at home and school.  It only gets more complicated when Shawn gets a pet pig (for one episode).  We also add a third main teacher to the school when Mr. Turners friend Eli (Alex Desert) gets a job teaching media.  And Cory and Eric find themselves throwing a last minute anniversary party for their parents Alan and Amy (William Russ and Betsy Randle), instead of the rave they had planned to throw.  Being the DisNerd that I am, I cant leave out a fun if improbably trip to Disney World that happens late in the season as well.

The season is filled with laughs.  I found the situations more realistic and funnier than some of the episodes last season, and I enjoyed just about every episode.  Even when they do get more serious with Shawns family situation or an episode focusing on Mr. Feeny late in the season, it earns those moments and still surrounds them with laughs.

I do feel like the episodes, which are presented here in their original air date order, are out of order a couple of times.  Its not that big a deal since the storylines are minor as they carry over from one episode to another, but it does annoy a little.

This is also the season that Corys younger sister Morgan gets a new actress.  After not being seen for most of the season, she pops up about two thirds of the way through played by Lindsay Ridgeway.  Her first scene is classic and hilarious.  Thats part of the overall effort to age the characters since Cory starts out in eighth grade, but seems to be fifteen by the end of the season.  Or am I not supposed to pay attention to things like that?  Frankly, its another minor issue since the laughs are still strong, and thats the most important thing.

I cant help but keep comparing these episodes to the ones airing when I started watching late in season 5.  In fact, I started watching about the time that Cory and Topanga broke up that season, and Shawn was so upset by it.  They break up in this season as well, and instead of doing everything possible to get them back together, Shawn is trying to help Cory move on.  Funny how things changed in two seasons, isn't it?

All the actors do great in their parts this season, and their deliveries and reactions lead to some great laughs.  This also rings true for Corys parents.  They don't have as many storylines of their own this season, but their scenes are always great.  Special guest stars this season include The Monkees, and in a fiftys Happy Days tribute show, Tom Bosley and Anson Williams as themselves with Pat Morita popping up in the episode as well.

All 22 episodes of season 3 are present on this three disc set in full frame and stereo sound, aka their original broadcast specifications.  For a sitcom, you don't need more than that really.  There does seem to be some volume issues with occasional drops.  Its annoying, but not super bad.  The only extra is a trivia game based on the season youve just watched.

So you don't need to get this season for the extras, but season 3 is filled with laughs.  Im enjoying this trip back through Boy Meets World.",1432684800,,4380,4.476670870113493

In Season Three itself, Shawn begins to feel a sense of longing for something more than Mr. Turner's apartment and eventually reunites with his father. Corey and Topanga break up for like five minutes, maybe five episodes in storyline terms and Eric realizes that now that he's a Senior, he needs to start developing some plan for his future leading to such hilarious episodes as to when Eric is accepted to BORIS and serves as an intern at a local television station. The show also continued its' ode to the past episodes with I once was a Teenage Spy that included cameos from Tom Boswell, Anson Williams, and Pat Morida. And Illegal Rave, which included several members of the Monkeys. The show also turned and tackled serious issues like when Corey and Shawn befriend Frankie the Enforcer or the season ending episodes where Corey struggles to deal with his brothers leaving for college and feeling like they were never really close.

It had a perfectly random smart sense of comedy - while still being spot-on when it came time to be serious - and was WAY under appreciated in its time. Love this show, and yes it definitely did get better with age. I wish the college episodes would have gone longer and maybe had a spin-off.

This is by far my favorite childhood series. I remember going home every day after school to catch the episodes on TV. I remember growing up with Cory, Topanga, and Shawn. It's worth a lo more than the junk we see on TV for kids nowadays. Although the first few seasons aren't my favorite, the later ones are great.

---------------------------------

Remember back when Boy Meets World was part of your daily life? When you sat and laughed through seven seasons with Cory, Topanga, Shawn, Eric, and Mr. Feeny? We were there in the beginning, when they were 6th grade, to the end, when they separated off on their own. Weren't you sad when the season ended and it wasn't on DVD or VHS for that matter.

The first three seasons of this classic series has been released but when Buena Vista Home Entertainment saw that the sales were dropping they discontinued the DVD releases. Many of us like to wait until every season is released and buy them in a bundled boxset. Because of the low sales, we might not see seasons 4-7.

Please sign this petition if you want Buena Vista Home Entertainment to release a boxset for Boy Meets World: Seasons 1-7 (Complete).

If the set actually comes out, kindly purchase it so they actually realize how many fans there are.

Spread the word!! Just tell 2 people and tell them to do the same, at that rate there will be hundreds and thousands in no time.",1162857600,6,1559,4.487632508833922

2288770,4,B0009F43D6,"wow at last after months of delays Buena vista finally ships season 3 of this great series.

season 3 demonstrated the pulling power that this show had at the time, with some major stars popping in just to add there names to the credits to some early cameos moements for other rising stars.

with some true peach moments the script writers did the show proud, with some true character development for one of the main cast (Eric the wise.... NOT) to the main stars of the show your wondering whether Cory would ever build up the courage to tell Topanga that he loved her who would have guessed that he would only to be beaten to the post by his best friend.

thankfully the writers thought far enough ahead to have a story running right through detailing some true teen issues whether its relating to growing up and the changes that happen to us all to some serious moments of pain and heartache that everyone goes through at this time, all the time coming from a young teenagers twisted point of view.

forget the price tag every moment of this show left you wanting to watch the next episode, sure some moments suck a little and some moements show the shows age (how the cast must look back at these early years and think my god how did I wear that) yet as a whole you couldn't ever hope for a better series for your kids, heck the nephew never even got look at disk 2 and 3 this is true quality better than some teen/adult shows.

As a whole though this isn't quite up to the standard as session 2 jumping from years 8 and 9 then back again and boy did Buena Vista cut the budget on the extra features, come on vista, PLEASE include some commentary from the cast in the season 4 from Ben and Daniell and Will or even some classic out takes not some naff quiz bit who ever thought this one up deserves to win turkey of the year. heck you added two extra episodes on season 1 and commentary. show that you care and value of your customs give the fans of this show what they deserve, lets also try not to wait another 8 months and try and get the next season or two out by Christmas",1126224000,,2081,4.244949494949495

This is the season with the first time-travel episode, where Cory finds himself in 1957 with his best friend Shawnzie and his girlfriend T. L.  My only problem with this release is the lack of commentaries. The first season had a couple, the second season had several. There are none on this, unfortunately.

2288774,5,B0009F43D6,"For those people who haven't seen my previous BMW reviews, I think that BMW is just a fantastic show. With that in mind, season three is no exception.

The gang are now on their next stage of high school life. There's a bit of confusion here at different points, because they seem to alternate between years 8 and 9. However this really isn't a major point of the show and unless people are going to get picky, it really doesn't matter.

The season starts out with Cory and Topanga FINALLY agreeing to be a 'couple'. Their relationship as some rocky moments, with Cory telling Topanga that he loves her early in the relationship, however things eventually get sorted. The relationship doesn't last though, as Cory and Topanga realise that they are spending too much time together and losing themselves. He eventually follows her to Disney World, Florida though in an attempt to win her back.

Meanwhile Shawn is adjusting to living with his new Guardian, teacher Jonathan Turner. As they try and find each other's boundaries, the audience learns a lot about each of these characters and both of them grow significantly throughout the season.

Cory's brother, Eric, also takes a more significant role this season, with several episodes focusing around the world that he lives in during his last year of High School.

And of course, Mr Feeny is always there to support and offer those words of wisdom.

There are heaps of known guest stars in this series as well who go on to do other works, or have been previously known for other works, including Andrew Keegan (10 things and 7th Heaven), Charisma Carpenter (Buffy and Angel), Brittany Murphy (Uptown Girls, Just Married etc), Richard Karn (Home Improvement), Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork, and Davy Jones (3 of the The Monkees), Mena Suvari (American Pie), Larisa Oleynik (10 things I hate about you) Pat Morita (Karate Kid Series) and Shane West (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen)

The episode list is as follows- My Best Friend's Girl, The Double Lie, What I Meant to Say, He Said She Said, Hometown Hero, This Little Piggy, Truth and Consequences, Rave On, The Last Temptation of Cory, Train of Fools, City Slackers, The Grass is Always Greener, New Friends and Old, A Kiss Is More than A Kiss, The Heart is A Lonely Hunter, Stormy Weather, The Pink Flamingo Kid, Life Lessons, I Was A Teenage Spy, I Never Sang For My Legal Guardian, The Happiest Show On Earth",1117584000,67,2411,4.78125

I'm so glad my boys enjoy this show as much as I did when I watched it on Friday evenings during TGIF. Highly recommend!!!",1491955200,,314,4.25
