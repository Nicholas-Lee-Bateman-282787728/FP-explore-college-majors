2056830,5,B00022PYO8,"I barely remember seeing this years ago, but parts of it are brilliant, and some not so brilliant. The lead actor is a terrible American actor, who shines maybe only a little twice in this movie. He has no charisma at all. I think the British casting director had no idea how to measure an American actor, and it shows. The great Peter Cushing is his normal brilliant self as actor who delivers the eerie goods in this movie, that could or should be a series that had continued on TV , mini-series or another movie, minus the bad American actor. He was bad. Check it out. In HD it looks GREAT. You fellow Americans will need a Blu-ray player that can handle multi region discs BTW. Enjoy.",1440374400,,688,4.3828125

THIS is a particularly entertaining --- hard to find --- TIME TRAVEL movie spanning the years between World War One,
and [then] modern day England.

No spoilers, here, just my highest rating of ALL TEN FINGERS up. It's got great music and even Peter Cushing...
you know, the old guy from STAR WARS!

2056834,4,B00022PYO8,A good fun family movie. Though it bears very little resemblance to any of the books I read as a child.,1362355200,,103,3.9523809523809526
2056835,5,B00022PYO8,"I know this was filmed in the style of the early 80s, and I know it could not have been more anachronistic, but I enjoyed it all the same.",1361664000,,138,3.793103448275862
2056836,5,B00022PYO8,I watched this 25 years ago and forgot the title name. I finally found it and bought this VHS movie. We watched it as a family and it was as funny as I remembered it. Arrived quickly and in good shape!,1309132800,,201,3.926829268292683
2056837,4,B00022PYO8,"I have managed to read some of the Biggles books when I was younger and this movie was very much like what I would have expected, a very tongue in cheek version of the written works. Only those who have been able to follow their adventures more fervently would be able to pick out the obvious flaws, but all in all, I had fun with it, even to see why a helicopter could outmatch a plane in the air. The movie wasn't meant to be anything more than a mild diversion to begin with, but it did, for me, have its moments.",1279152000,,516,4.068627450980392
2056838,5,B00022PYO8,"Absolutely loved the movie, arrived quicker than expected and in good order. Only problem  does not fit into Australian DVD format, but got around that by changing country code on equipment. Thank you for your prompt response, regards,

2056839,5,B00022PYO8,"While the product itself was fine, most (but not all) of the customer service was lacking.  SUPER slow arrival and miscommunications made the transaction less than ideal.  The ONLY person I had luck speaking with on the phone was ""Lacey"" who finally made the transaction possible! Had it not been for her superior abilities I would have given up and never consdiered purchasing through Amazon in the future.",1207353600,,407,4.970588235294118
2056840,3,B00022PYO8,"This movie is seriously flawed in so many aspects.  The dialog is both written and often times delivered in an amateurish fashion, the lighting is some of the worst I've ever seen in a professional film and the actions of the characters in response to their surroundings is simply not within reason.  Nonetheless... it's an entertaining film.  At times it makes you grimace and roll your eyes with its shortcomings, but it remains entertaining in the manner of the old sci-fi serials such as Flash Gordon, et. al.  And, of course, Fiona Hutchison is pleasing eye candy.  Certainly not a classic, but not a bad way to pass some time.",1193097600,,632,4.709090909090909
2056841,5,B00022PYO8,"The story of Biggles starts with a British novelist (W.E. Johns)who writes a series of adventure novels starring James Bigglesworth, an ace British pilot during the First and Second World Wars.
The novels were well recieved, and developed into an ongoing pulp magazine that published from the early '30s well into the '70s.

The movie, Biggles: Adventures in time, was periled from the beginning. Cursed with a small budget and a rather dated script, many consider this movie to be just a B list adventure flick.

I think differently.
Though the special effects are lacking, and some of the lines are quite bad (even for an 80's flick), this movie captures a certain type of adventure you don't see too often.
The script lacks, but the actors took their lines and made the best of them, giving rather unique performances that dispel your disbelief and genuinely intrigue. The music fits surprisingly well for an 80's adventure film, and many, loving scenes of British fighter planes dogfighting German warplanes help to put you into Biggles' world. The plot, as fantastical and outlandish as it may seem, flows really well and fits in with the 30's pulp adventure theme.

In short, this movie is a bit of a trip back in time, to not only the 80's when it was made, but to the 30's when Biggles came into being. It drives you along in a thrilling and genuinely fun adventure that, accompanied by great acting and well scored music, delivers a great film to watch with the whole family.",1189814400,,1484,4.744186046511628
2056842,1,B00022PYO8,"This movie was so bad.  If you enjoy really bad acting, really bad plots with really big holes in it, this is the movie for you!  The star? Peter Cushing.  The only saving grace.",1182816000,,178,4.176470588235294
2056843,4,B00022PYO8,"an afecienado special for all 'Biggles' fans, an absolutely impossible story that Cptn W.E.Johns, the original author would have no doubt spluttered over in the best 1920s-40s british tradition. But I loved every minute of it. Of course Biggles could fly a Jetranger copter with-out lessons, he was an accompished Sopwith Camel pilot. A seriously 'Own Boys Annual' thumping good yarn and I recommend it to all that enjoy such things.",1175731200,,433,5.112676056338028
2056844,5,B00022PYO8,"This movie used to be one of my all-time favorites as a kid.  For anyone who ever read the childrens' Captain Bigglesworth novels by W. E. Johns and dreamed of flying heroicaly by the side of the dashing Biggles, you will love this movie.

For everyone who hasn't had that pleasure, this B movie will come across as very 80's and retro, but good harmless fun.  It has it all - comedy, drama, action, and even a little romance.

Kids will particularly like this movie, but keep in mind that there are a couple of scary scenes with the Nazi superweapon.  Even adults can enjoy this movie - I know that I still do!  Seeing a World War One pilot flying a helicopter is just hilarious and there is a marvelous scene with some English punks.

Fun for the whole family - Enjoy!",1158883200,,770,4.3426573426573425
2056845,4,B00022PYO8,"A very enjoyable film with excellent WWI flying scenes (worth it just for the aircraft).  The music is strange at times, but overall the film is fun and engaging.",1155600000,,162,4.586206896551724
2056846,3,B00022PYO8,"I loved the 'Biggles' books by Captain W.E. Johns as a child and have re-read them as an adult now my own children are old enough for them. They are still excellent boys adventure books. I bought this movie for my 10 year old as he loves the Biggles books especially those set during the 1st World War with plenty of dogfights.

In the movie some of the dogfights, the trenches and the uniforms helped him visualize the books and there are some nicely shot scenes in London, but the story line itself is far removed from the original Biggles series and even those parts set in 1917 have a strong fantasy element. If you view it as a 'time travel' movie that just happens to go back to Biggles in the RFC in WW1 then you are less likely to be disappointed.

With the notable exception of Peter Cushing who plays Col. Raymond in the 1980's, the casting/acting is OK but not superb. Personally I found the modern music jarred with the 1917 scenes, but my boys liked it!

Although this movie is only rated PG there is one scene in the middle just after the Germans have tested their secret weapon that is in my opinion a little too graphic for my younger 8 year old, but other than that couple of minutes the rest of the war scenes are ok for both my 8 and 10 year old boys (but not my younger boys).

Overall this movie is worth seeing if you like Biggles or time travel, but is probably not worth paying almost $20 for.",1153180800,,1417,4.256505576208179
2056847,3,B00022PYO8,"I have had this movie in one form or another for years.  It is certainly not an A level movie, but I find it purely enjoyable. I do not expect to have to think, just watch and enjoy.",1142208000,,182,3.789473684210526
2056848,2,B00022PYO8,"For those unfamiliar, the Biggles books were a long-running series of boys own style adventures about a WW1 British pilot (the series ran long enough to take in WW2, post-war secret service adventures and even a series of Kiplingesque prequels about his childhood in India), and terrific fun they were too. The movie was in development for more than a decade (at one point a hideously miscast Dudley Moore was mooted for the lead after hitting it big in 10) and the finished film looks like they finally just decided to make something, anything because they'd spent so much money in development.

The end result is the biggest misconceived fiasco of a potential franchise until Working Title's 2004 Thunderbirds came along and turned a weekly sci-fi disaster movie series into a bad kiddie flick. So, to appeal to an audience with no interest in the series and to alienate anyone who was, the plot centres around an American TV dinner promoter who finds himself traveling back in time to 1917 to help his 'time twin' Biggles destroy a secret German weapon that could help them win the war and change the course of history. If that isn't bad enough, it comes with a woefully wrong score by Stanislas that sounds like a BBC Radiophonic attempt to do New Romantic via Kraftwerk, a complete absence of dogfights, poor action scenes, weak comic relief, lazy direction from John Hough and terrible writing (the 'love' story is related entirely as backstory by one of Biggles' sidekicks). Peter Cushing is fine in his last film role and the film does have one deliriously demented line of dialog - 'Get us out of here before they realize you're not a god, you're just an American!' - but is definitely best avoided.",1119052800,,1708,4.77027027027027
2056849,4,B00022PYO8,"The movie BIGGLES:ADVENTURES IN TIME is a rather odd movie to try and review. All logic says that the movie should be soundly panned - a low budget time travel movie about two ""time twins"" who bounce back and forward between 1980s New York and London and the Western Front in the French trenches of World War I whenever the other is in mortal peril.

Though the movie has plenty moments that make you cringe - the `old boy attitude' of the British flyers in WWI, the dated fashions of the 1980s and some of the most awe inspiringly terrible dialogue and dialogue deliveries in recent years. Yet in spite of it all this movie also has a certain amount of charm and there are a number of times in which you cannot help but feel seduced by the Boy's Own adventure of it all.

Drawing its inspiration from a series of Biggles novels by British author Capt. W.E. Johns, the movie is really the story of American celebrity dinners CEO Jim Ferguson (played by Alex Hyde-White). Following a visit from a mysterious elderly Englishman (played by Peter Cushing in his last movie), Ferguson finds himself transported back to World War One France where he meets British flying ace Biggles, whose Sopwith Camel bi-plane crashes nearby.

It becomes apparent that Ferguson must help Biggles complete his mission to destroy a German sound machine, a technology that could lead to Germany winning the war (one wonders why Germany didn't simply build more than one). The young cast are quite good in their roles, the music is serviceable and there is some very nice biplane dogfight scenes between Biggles and his archenemy Von Stalhein.

Faithful only in spirit to the Johns books, this movie was obviously meant to be the start of a franchise as evidenced by the ending, but that never transpired. This movie has its moments and for time-travel fans it will fill a nice couple of hours, but it's a movie where its parts are better than the whole. A true guilty pleasure.",1100044800,,1954,4.671511627906977
2056850,5,B00022PYO8,"Though this film takes places in the 80's, it still presents a sense of possiblity to time travel.  It's about a man from the 80's meeting a World War I ace pilot and the adventure they go on is simply amazing.  Though the surprise on the characters faces don't seem to be what is expected of them they do show curiousity and awe at what they see.

For people into movies that are about the future this is a good one to have.",1092268800,,425,4.096385542168675
2056851,4,B00022PYO8,"Biggles is based on an old British sci fi book or comic book series which was quite popular in the UK. A young American frozen food CEO, Ferguson, is suddenly, inexplicably transported back in time onto the French front lines of the Western front of WWI where he meets British flying ace Biggles, whose plane has been downed. After assisting Biggles, he's suddenly back in his NY apartment, but a lot worse for the wear which at least tells him it wasn't all some awful dream.

An old British officer (Peter Cushing) then visits and explains that his suddenly traveling through this time portal back to 1918 France could happen again whenever WWI flying ace Biggles and his men are in trouble trying to complete his dangerous mission. Somehow the two men are linked. Ferguson dismisses all of this, but after suddenly getting wrenched through time again from the floors of a food trade show to the middle of an aerial battle with a German pilot over 1918 France, he's convinced he has to go to London, learn more about Biggles in order to help him complete his mission and end the time traveling so he can get on with his life and marry his fiance.

Ferguson learns Biggles is out to destroy a German doomsday high frequency sound device which turns solid objects, including people, into dust. If he fails, the device could alter the outcome of WWI causing the Germans to win and, of course, the future/present day (the film was made in the late 1980s) would be dramatically altered.

With a lot of humor and an appealing young cast, Ferguson, at the worst possible times (including right after getting out of the shower with only a towel around his waist) finds himself suddenly transported back to 1918. And Biggles gets a jolt when he's  transported with Ferguson to late 1980's London filled with Punk groups, and sees and flies his first helicopter.

Aside from the humor, lots of danger and excitement with bi-plane aerial battles, and an appealing cast. I don't know if this got a theatrical release in the States, but the film has excellent production values, is shot on location in London (including the Tower hotel and Tower Bridge) and about rural England. Only thing I dislike is some of the rock music used during the helicopter flights. The ending is very cute with Biggles and his appealing band of men in trouble again.",1088812800,,2335,4.699266503667482
2056852,5,B00022PYO8,"This is probably one of the true classics of the 80's, portraying the battle between the two famous fighter pilots of WW1: Biggles in his Sopwith Camel, and his notorious arch enemy Von Stalhein. Of course, many elements of this movie is fiction, not to mention that it doesn't even start with all of this.
The movie actually starts in what should be today (which now is 20 years ago (the 80's, yes?)) James Ferguson is a commercializer for a TV dinner kind of deal, and he suddenly goes back in time to meet biggles. Sound wierd`? Well, what can I say, that were the 80's for ya.
But highly original plot, excellent score and soundtrack, and wonderful atmosphere makes this a movie to remember.",1028937600,,695,4.568
8020835,5,B00022PYO8,I had this movie in VHS.  Now have it on DVD.  My husband and I both love this movie.  A young man who produces airline food is suddenly whisked back to the battlegrounds of World War II where he meets Biggles and his mates.,1526515200,,224,4.045454545454546

8020837,5,B00022PYO8,"A caterer of sorts (Alex Hyde-White as Ferguson) abruptly finds himself slipping in and out of time to save Lieutenant Biggles (Neil Dickson) from certain death.  Forewarned on several occasions by William Raymond (the incomparable Peter Cushing), Ferguson learns that he and Biggles are time twins, capable of aiding each other in times of crisis.

Originally, this film was meant to be similar to the adventures in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  But since Back to the Future was a hit, and time travel was all the ragethey found themselves heading in a different direction.

I first saw this film in 1989 and thought it was a hoot.  I took a chance buying it, hoping my memory wasn't faulty.  Yep, its still a hoot.  And, as a fan of Peter Cushing, I had to add his last film role to my collection.",1518480000,,795,4.556338028169014
8020838,1,B00022PYO8,Very disappointing in almost every way.,1518220800,,39,5.666666666666667
8020839,3,B00022PYO8,"As a big Peter Cushing fan I was always interested in seeing his last screen performance, and 'Biggles' was it. He is, undoubtedly, the best thing about the film. The two leads are rather wooden and nondescript, and the story is rather far-fetched (time travel linking World War I and the 1980s). Cushing brings a stately presence and weight to the scenes he plays, but the rest of it is rather badly dated, and a very jarring 80s synth soundtrack really hampers the end result. So, overall, if you're a fan of Peter Cushing, it's certainly worth a watch, and I'm glad I did, but that painfully awful soundtrack means I won't be watching it again any time soon.",1503014400,,661,4.563025210084033
