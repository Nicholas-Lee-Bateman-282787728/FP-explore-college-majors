8259863,4,B000BQ5J4U,"Beyond All Limits - digitally remastered - from VCI Entertainment is an English ""version"" of Flor de Mayo.

Set in a Mexican coastal fishing town, fisherman Pepe Gamboa (Pedro Armendariz), wife Magdalena (Maria Felix), and son live a good life --- until American Jim Gatsby (Jack Palance) appears on the scene. Jim and Magdalena were once lovers, and Pepe's son may have been fathered by Jim, or so Pepe fears.

Gabriel Figueroa's cinematography is a stand-out in this film that is generally heavy on the drama.

Not having been a great fan of Mexican movies, (not that I didn't like them, I just was not exposed to many), this is interesting on several levels... Jack Palance and Maria Felix create a strong on screen presence - but doesn't Jack always... and here he seems younger than his actual years.  I've read that Felix was more of a Star than an actress, but she seemed up to the task in this movie.",1422835200,2,908,4.62111801242236
