8031487,5,B0002T2QU6,"We love the Scholastic Video Collections!!  Our first collection included the story ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"".  My two year old son doesn't ask to watch a movie or television.  He asks for ""Boom Boom""!  He especially loves the stories that are put to music or song.

The Scholastic Video Collection is a series that every household with babies, toddlers and preschool age children should have.  They are good, clean, educational fun.",1169078400,2,433,5.028169014084507
