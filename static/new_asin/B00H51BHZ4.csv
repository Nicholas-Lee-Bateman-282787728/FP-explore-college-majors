8630078,5,B00H51BHZ4,"Great restoration of a surprisingly good movie. Always been a big fan of Christopher Lee and Oliver Reed and both are very good in this. Glad to see Hammer ""great"" Michael Ripper have a more substantial role. Enjoyed it very much. Favorite scene- blindfolded sword fighting. Do not try this at home!",1494633600,,299,4.769230769230769
8630079,5,B00H51BHZ4,"A very intersting and unusual pirate movie. With historical incursions, and a good, deep sight of each character. Good restoration it seems too, and if someone love the kind, it is worth having it.",1475280000,,197,4.823529411764706
8630080,5,B00H51BHZ4,My son was ecstatic when he received this in the mail.  Was received in excellent condition and on time.  I would recommend ordering from Kerwin Mathews again.,1456704000,,159,4.851851851851852
8630081,3,B00H51BHZ4,"If death by piranha fish is your thing,this is the movie for you! The Pirates of Blood River is a bloody,somewhat convoluted pirate film from -you guessed it - Hammer Films - starring Kerwin Mathews and Christopher Lee. In the town of Devon,Mathews is exiled by his father for having committed adultery. He is sentenced to a prison camp and escapes but is captured by a gang of pirates captained by Christopher Lee. The pirates force Mathews to guide them back to Devon to steal the town's hidden treasure. Highlights(if this is what you are looking for) include a number of violent fights and two(yes,TWO!)rather imaginative  scenes of death by piranha. NOT for the squeamish!",1424995200,,677,4.886956521739131
8630082,4,B00H51BHZ4,"Most people who are fans of Hammer Films are aware of the fact that, during their heyday, they made many other films outside the Gothic horror and science fiction genres that made them famous. There were the black & white suspense films like PARANOIAC and SCREAM OF FEAR along with comedies like LIFE WITH THE LYONS and ON THE BUSES. Then there were a number of historical action-adventure films like SWORD OF SHERWOOD FOREST and THE SCARLET BLADE. THE PIRATES OF BLOOD RIVER falls into this category. It was successful enough to warrant a sequel of sorts a few years later called THE DEVIL SHIP PIRATES but this is the better of the two. They were both issued back in 2008 as part of a Hammer ICONS OF ADVENTURE 2 DVD set from Sony (to cash in on THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN phenomenon) that also featured TERROR OF THE TONGS and THE STRANGLERS OF BOMBAY. It was as part of that set that I first saw it. The set is still available and, as it's roughly the same price, you might want to purchase it for the other 3 films but if BLOOD RIVER is all you're interested in then this DVD-R will do the trick as it's an exact copy of the same beautiful print in the correct aspect ratio.

The BLOOD RIVER part of the title comes from the fact that the Huguenot settlement in the film (called Devon) is surrounded by a river that contains piranha fish (I would have thought that it would be too cold for them). We see them in action early as they devour an adulterous wife (most of which was cut). American contract players Kerwin Mathews and Glenn Corbett play settlers who must fight off an invasion of pirates led by Christopher Lee with Peter Arne, Michael Ripper, and a young Oliver Reed in tow. This may be Michael Ripper's finest hour for Hammer as an actor while there is a spellbinding swordfight between Oliver Reed and Peter Arne with both men blindfolded. Christopher Lee underplays his role as the one-eyed leader of the pirates to great effect. Andrew Keir also scores as the stern leader of the settlement who refuses to reveal where the community's riches are. Director John Gilling moves the film along with his customary skill and the screenplay (partially by him) touches on his social concerns. Like most of Hammer movies, PIRATES is little more than an upscale B picture, but it never ceases to amaze me at how they consistently managed to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.",1409184000,3,2391,4.496551724137931
