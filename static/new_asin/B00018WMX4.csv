8008554,2,B00018WMX4,"This disc includes `40`s Superman (#01 Mad Scientist, #02 The Mechanical Monster, #03 Billion Dollar Limited, #04 The Artic Giant, #05 The Bulleteers,  #06 The Magnetic Telescope), Woody Woodpecker (#04. Pantry Panic), Little Lulu (Cad & Caddy), Mighty Mouse (Wolf Wolf), Mutt & Jeff (Westwood Whoa, Slick Slueths), & Baby Huey (Pest Pupils, Quack A Doodle Do).  There are also two additional cartoons (Cheese Burglar, Stupidsitious Cat).

There's nothing really enduring here as these cartoons are more old than they are classic & don`t seem to have been restored at all.  They won't challege more mature minds but they'd certainly be better veiwing for your 4-6 year-olds than the garbage on TV today.",1173139200,,703,5.1946902654867255
