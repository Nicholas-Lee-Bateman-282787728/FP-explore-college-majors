2480121,4,B000E1MXTG,"This movie had a profound affect on me as a child growing up in the late fifties, early sixties. From a Protestant family, we were taught to have little to do with any Catholic notions that elevated the Virgin Mary to any importance other than serving as the Mother of the divine child. Yet for some reason I still felt somehow connected to this wonderfully moving, if not completely accurate cinematic re-telling of the appearances of the ""Beautiful Lady in White"" to three peasant children in Fatima, Portugual in 1917.

Finally with its long awaited release on DVD last month I was greatly looking forward to viewing it once again, albeit this time with much older, critical eyes and a markedly more jaded and cyncial mindset. Now having viewed the '52 religious classic all I can say is I must be an old softie after all. The three children are delightful, particularily Susan Whitney (Lucia) in her one and only film appearance, as is Gilbert Roland as the amiable, though historically fictitious town drunk Hugo.

'The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima' has held up well through the years and still remains one of the great religious films of all-time. Completely accurate or not, this film will touch the heart of even the most resistant non-believer.",1146096000,103,1254,4.800925925925926
2480122,5,B000E1MXTG,"I just bought the new DVD release of the movie today and it again brought tears to my eyes after watching it (even after many, many viewings of the videocassette version that I've had for years).

This is an inspiring and beautiful depiction of the apparitions at Fatima - well cast and enjoyably told. I highly recommend this movie -- just try watching the scene involving the solar miracle at the end of the movie without getting tears in your eyes...

2480123,5,B000E1MXTG,"I have seen this movie on TV and although as one review expressed it should be made over it is still worth seeing. I have been to Fatima quite often, if I am in Portugal I need to visit Fatima...it just something that I must do and it always pulls me there. It's an experience that can not be described.",1141344000,8,303,4.066666666666666
2480124,4,B000E1MXTG,"MEL GIBSON, if you're listening, how about a remake of this film without the deletion of some key scenes such as the eucharistic prayer of adoration taught by the angel, the children receiving communion by the angel, the vision of hell, the death of the children? Also, the entirety of the messages given by our Lady should be put on film. Is there a story anywhere more fascinating or relevant to our times that should be told on film?",1141257600,53,436,4.531645569620253

2480175,5,B000E1MXTG,"All I can say to those who read this is we need to learn as much as we can about this past event in our history.  For me, I am convinced this enent happened.  Of course I am expressing my own opinion.  I saw this movie in 1952 if memory serves me right.  The message is still relavent.  The request Our Lady of Fatima made has yet to be accomplished.  Is our Churches leadership stupid or what?  The movie is well done.  The acting is proper.  The message is relavent and needs to be taken seriously.  The price of this video is appropriate.  I enjoyed the movie and I hope others will as well.  Of course society has changed since this movie was produced but the message has not.  In the end, common sense and reason will win out and the message will be accomplished.  All high brow intelectiual arguments against it will evaporate like bubbles on water.  The promis made to mankind is still waiting to be realized.",1495411200,5,916,4.337278106508876

2480305,5,B000E1MXTG,"The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima holds many fond memories for me.  The first time I saw it, I took my beloved grandmother with me.  She was ecstatic, since she was a woman of deep faith and goodness. I have watched it several times since then, when it was shown on television.  The character of Hugo, played by Gilbert Roland, is probably an invention, but it gives comic relief to what might otherwise be a rather somber film.  However, the historical nature of the film, especially that section depicting the persecution by the government of the clergy, rings true.  Furthermore, the children did suffer--if at least psychologically--at the hands of the atheistic government.  I happen to believe in the appearances at Fatima; too many people claimed to have seen the colorful, dancing, and plunging sun.  The entire film was made with taste along with an urgent plea for peace in a world now more threatened than ever.",1461888000,,922,4.7974683544303796

This is a condensed version I want to say with different actors. Well done movie but to me this is like the study version before a test.

2480402,5,B000E1MXTG,"I bought this film a year ago, and it's fantastic. Sure, the music is a bit goofy. The actor who plays the administrator lurches around flinging doors shut and snarling. He even cowers in a corner at one point (sorry, no spoilers). You almost expect this guy to wave a cape and twirl his mustache.

Aside from that, ""Fatima"" is an inspiring film. With religious freedom being threatened in America and around the world, it's bracing to remember the way the Portuguese people stuck to their guns in spite of a tyrannical, God-hating government.

Additionally, Fatima gives food for thought. I'm not Catholic, as I've said in other reviews, but what happened defies simple explanation.",1436572800,11,683,4.930434782608696

2480481,5,B000E1MXTG,"*One of the most inspirational and angelic movies ever to come to the big screen.  Beautifully indescribable and will sure to touch every inch of your heart before the movie is even over.  Starring Angela Clarke and Guilbert Roland in this masterpiece based on true and factual-events that occured in the small village of Fatima, Portugal in the year 1917.  In 1910, Fatima was losing all resolve.  With an uprising overthrowing the government , all churches were closed and all religious orders were persecuted against, including throwing all priests' in prison.  As World War 1 broke out, the priests' were released and the churches were reopened.  Then on May 15, 1917, when three young children were sent to do an errand, their world as they knew it, was about to change forever. When Hollywood wanted to make this motion picture, they wanted it to do something very unique.  To make it one hundred percent factual at all costs and in order to accomplish that, they needed to go to the source.  Lucia, the oldest of the three children and now grown and in the holy order, agreed to help and along with the writers and director, gave a full and accurate account of what she and her two childhood friends encountered that day.  Before finishing the task that they were sent to do, they stopped to eat something.  Of course, they knew that first they must say the rosary.  In a silly mood, they screamed it into the heavens when suddenly there was a roar of thunder and a beautiful lady appeared speaking of love and praise. She asked the three children if they would return every month of the thirteenth for six months. That she was sent from God to warn the people of the world to say their rosary and their prayers.  Would they do this, she asked?  Lucia (portrayed by Angela Clarke) agreed that they would without fail.  The lady warned them though that they would face emotional torture, be berated, ridiculed to the highest, all turmoils for the sake of God. When the vision was over, they came acrossed their good friend Hugo (portrayed by Guilbert Roland)  and tell him about the beautiful lady.  Hugo, who is a thief and a shady character to say the least, loves the children and would kill anyone who even touched a hair on their head, but he advises them to keep it a secret.  But soon, the secret is out and the religious leaders are terrified, especially Lucia's mother. Against her mother's wishes, Lucia, along with her two friends return to the Cova and much to their amazement , there are hundreds of people behind them to pay homage to the Blessed Virgin.  It is on this day that Lucia asks if the Lady can help the sick and the cripple?  She vows that on October 13 she will perform a miracle so whoever believes in her which Jesus wants her known to the world will be healed!  As time goes on, the children are faced with turmoil, threats made on their lives and the tormented aspects that the Lady said they would be under but it was their faith and love for God to keep them in their good graces because on October 13, 1917, the beautiful Lady kept her promise and bestowed and created a miracle of the most high.  As the heavens  opened up, so did the faithful.  On October 13, 1952, millions of people flourished Fatima, Portugal to pay homage to the Bessed Lady of the Rosary.  That night millions of people lit candles to light up the heavens to show their love for God.  Lucia gave herself to the Holy Order and lived out her life as a nun and in the Bascilica of the altar, her two little friends were laid to rest......one of the most breathtaking and inspirational movies of all time.  Beautiful and powerful music by the legendary Max Steiner and a definete must see! I kid you not!...if you start out questioning yourself for any reason by the end of this movie, it will make you feel like a true believer....trust me...enjoy!.......thank you...",1422662400,9,3878,4.55988455988456

2480484,4,B000E1MXTG,"As a very small youngster, I always got THE SONG OF BERNADETTE and THE MIRACLE OF OUR LADY OF FATIMA confused in my mind. I was always waiting for Vincent Price to show up as a prosecutor in MIRACLE! Both stories - based on true events close to 100 years apart - are amazingly  similar. THE MIRACLE OF OUR LADY OF FATIMA still seems fairly contemporary - although it happened now nearly 100 years ago - and it ought to serve as a warning to those who value and believe in their religious faith and freedom that the government of any country - including our own - could take steps to diminish or outright destroy them.

Wonderful story, good cast and production values for a modest Warner Bros. film. I would have liked to see some ""extras"" on the DVD, but these days all you generally get is the film and maybe a trailer. However, the film is well worth having in your collection!",1420848000,,880,4.359756097560975

2480506,5,B000E1MXTG,"The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima is a fact-based film about the the events surrounding the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Portugal in the town called Ftima in 1917.

While tending sheep, three farm children claim to see a vision of the Virgin Mary. The local adults insist that the kids keep quiet about this vision. They fear reprisals from the anti-Catholic Portuguese government. But word gets out, and soon thousand of pilgrims are flocking to Fatima, awaiting the miracle that the visionaries promised to deliver to the three youngsters. And, then, on October 13, 1917, as witnessed by thousands of pilgrims, the sun mysteriously sunk in the sky and many of those present have been miraculously cured of their ailments. As the sun returns to normal we see Hugo standing in the middle of the kneeling crowd, his hat still on. Removing it, he says ""Only the fool sayeth there is no God."".The film ends with Lucia,now a nun,praying at the tomb of her fellow visionaries together with the converted,Hugo.

As a fact-based movie,credit must be given to James O'Hanlon and Crane Wilb for doing a fine job of structuring the basic facts of the apparitions at Fatima and the treatment they gave to the events surrounding it. Also,John Brahm did a wonderful job of musical score. Too bad that I found Susan Whitney's portrayal of Lucia as somewhat forced and dull as she becomes of a tear-jerking visionary and lacks depth in her performance despite her effort in being earnest and sincere in her portrayal. No wonder the real Sister Lucia never liked the film upon seeing it. Also,I felt that some parts of the movie were dull and boring especially during the first half when the locals were skeptical about the story of Marian apparitions told by the visionaries as it became more of a melodrama and it fails to capture the sympathy of the viewers. But the final scene was definitely spectacular as it manages to provide a great ending to the film especially when miracle of the sun occurred. Great scenes of the sun and Hugo's conversion makes it both dramatic and entertaining.",1417910400,,2089,4.78393351800554

* ""The title Our Lady of Fatima honors the Blessed Virgin in connection with the apparitions to three young visionaries in Ftima, Portugal, on the 13th day of each month starting in May [1917] and ending in October, when the famous 'Miracle of the Sun' occurred....The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima (1952) is....well made, entertaining, and fairly faithful to the main facts (despite liberties such as Gilbert Roland's fictional rascal with a heart of gold, added to help mediate the story for mainstream audiences)....the film opens with the October 1910 revolution, emphasizing the severe anticlerical persecutions of the revolutionaries and the fidelity of the Portuguese people to the faith of their fathers"" (Steven D.

2480584,3,B000E1MXTG,"Three peasant children have a vision in the fields of Fatima, Portugal, of a lovely lady who asks them to come back for six months on the thirteenth. More importantly, she asks them to pray for peace in the world. Portugal in 1917 is still struggling under an atheistic government (the product of a socialist revolution in 1910) that tries to suppress religious sentiments in the people. A small town like Fatima seems an unlikely place for an outburst of religious fervor, the kind of which makes authorities nervous. Word gets around and people start coming to see the Blessed Virgin Mary and ask for her intercession in the subsequent months.

The film is a reasonably good survey of the events of 1917, providing enough of the revolution history to show the dangers coming from the government (it does seem slightly motivated by Cold War attitudes as well as by dramatic impact). The children, Lucia and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta, are simple and pious. They refuse to deny the visions in spite of opposition from Lucia's mother, their parish priest, and the local magistrate. A ne'er-do-well adult by the name of Hugo is added as a cynical advocate for the children. He helps in practical matters but has no faith at the start of the movie. He's the most colorful character even though his arc from rapscallion to believer is fairly obvious from the moment he shows up. Most of the other people (aside from Lucia's mother) are not fleshed out enough. The end of the movie gives the (then) most recent history of pilgrims flocking to the church built on the site of the apparitions, along with an older Hugo and Lucia talking about their lives.

The story of the apparitions in Fatima is an interesting one and has had a great impact on the Catholic faith in the twentieth century. But the film, as accurate as it is, is also a bit too sweet and plays it too safe. The socialists are clearly bad guys, but they never actually hurt people other than putting them in jail and closing the church. A scene where the magistrate threatens to boil the children in oil slowly is a bit scary, but the most actual discomfort the children are put through is banishment to a furnished room and later, a jail cell full of ruffians who wind up praying the rosary with the children (possibly my favorite scene in the film). The dramatic tension is never very tight; the stakes never seem high. The movie isn't bad except for being bland. The actors playing Lucia and Hugo were quite good.",1395014400,,2484,4.6431818181818185

But what was it? This film is innocent in its portrayal of the time and the story, but it does touch upon the fear of a totalitarian government by a people weary from war.

There are those who seek to capitalize on what occurs, those who are in fear and those who will not believe unless they see it with their own eyes, and of course, those who will never believe.  All the while, the simple faith of the children and their unwavering testimony to their experience.  I am not Catholic but I was moved and inspired.

This movie doesn't show the harsh penances or words that were spoken between Our Lady and the Three Shepherd Children or 95% other parts of the Message.

She requested an abbey be built in her honor on a nearby hill, Diego told his bishop, and offered as proof of her visit a bouquet of roses she gave him with her image permanently imprinted on the bouquet's wrapping. Today this image is on display above the altar in the big, beautiful Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City attracting millions of people annually.
On August 21st, 1879, 15 people claimed they saw the Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, and Saint John the Evangelist together at a church in Knock County, Ireland. On the altar beside them, the 15 said, was a lamb around which angels hovered. A board of inquiry's acceptance of their testimonies as trustworthy inspired devotion to the site and today millions of people visit there annually.
On October 13, 1917, three children from the Portuguese village of Fatima, Lucia Santos and her cousins Yaseta and Francisco, claimed they spoke to the Virgin Mary. She appeared to them before, they said, but this time told them the world war being fought would soon end and there would not be another if man would do penance and turn to God.  But if man did not, she warned, there would come a war far more terrible. Advances in scientific discovery had reached a point that revised the traditional concept of war. If man did not devise some better means of settling differences between nations, Armageddon would be at our door.
The children asked Mary for a sign so others would know she appeared to them and thousands, including the Holy Father in Rome, witnessed strange apparitions in the sky that scientists have never been able to explain.",1364688000,,1741,4.671009771986971

I very much enjoyed Song Of Bernadette but this film is so poorly done it became hard to watch. I found Gilbert Roland the only reason to watch the film; to watch it as a film that is, not as a confirmation of faith. Whatever you believe or disbelieve about the event in the film can you actually imagine the Virgin Mary would appear and say the Russians are bad people? Of course we were in the middle of what was called the cold war when the film was made and the Russians were the bad guys, but I laughed out loud and began to enjoy the film because it was so bad it became funny. Viewed just as a film, this was horrible. I gave it two stars only for Gilbet Roland, even out of place in this poor film he was an actor I admired.

2480919,5,B000E1MXTG,"Even though Sister Lucia dos Santos reportedly didn't care much for this movie, 1952's The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima presents a moving, albeit overly dramatic, account of the series of visions of the Virgin Mary experienced by three children in Fatima, Portugal, in 1917.  It is primarily the story of the children and the great faith they exhibited in the face of terrible pressures from all sides as the story of their visions spread throughout the countryside.  The message of the Lady herself is somewhat truncated here, as there is no mention of any ""secrets"" and the content that I, as a Protestant, would regard as controversial is never brought to light.  Instead, the movie concentrates more on establishing the sociopolitical context in which the events took place.  Most people know a little something about Fatima, but few can truly appreciate the danger the children faced from the strongly anti-clerical position of the state at that time.

While tending to a flock of sheep on a May afternoon in 1917, Lucia dos Santos and her younger friends Jacinta and Francisco Marto are suddenly confronted by the vision of a beautiful lady in the clouds who asks them if they are willing to suffer for the salvation of lost souls and announces that she will visit them on the same day of each of the next several months.  The first person they tell of the vision is the rakish but kind-hearted Hugo da Silva (Gilbert Roland), who is an entirely fictional character who adds a great deal to the film.  He advises them not to tell anyone else, but young Jacinta can't keep such incredible news to herself, and so the story of the visions quickly begins to spread.  While a growing number of people come to believe the story, others dismiss it as a childhood fantasy.  The toughest critic is Lucia's mother, who actually punishes her for telling lies.  The local priest puts no credence in the children's claims, either (suggesting that, if it were true, it was probably the work of the devil), and tries to squelch the story altogether out of fear of government reprisal.  The socialist government that had come to power in Portugal in 1910 had all but made the practice of religion illegal, closing churches and locking up priests and bishops.  While the state had eased up on the restrictions somewhat by 1917, no church officials wanted to risk stirring up any new trouble.  Despite the clergy's best efforts to dismiss the story as the product of a child's imagination, the state does take action, shutting down the local church and putting increasing pressure on the children to recant their story.  That is largely because thousands of  everyday men and women are assembling in Fatima each month to witness the visitations themselves - and the same socialists who shouted ""Power to the people!"" on their road to power fear the assembly of large numbers of people just as much as any other oppressive government once they have achieved their goal.

Some critics described a rather passionless performance by Susan Whitney as Lucia, but I thought she did a fantastic job.  Despite all the tears she shed at being accused of lying by the state, the church, and even her own family, she demonstrates an inner peace that comes from understanding, taking on more and more of a beatific radiance as the story works its way up to the famous Miracle of the Sun.  I don't know if it's the lighting or what, but Lucia possesses an aura that is fully captured on film (an effect that modern cinematography seems technically incapable of producing).  You might think that the addition of a source of comic relief in the form of the fictional character Hugo would be a mistake in such a serious drama, but it works beautifully in this script, actually reinforcing - in the end - the power of the message that is at the heart of this story.  This is just a wonderful and emotionally powerful film whichever way you look at it.",1312329600,2,3923,4.732745961820852

Susan Whitney, portraying Lucia, is remarkable; her hopes and her fears are portrayed with a true quality. Lucia is forced to honor both the wishes of the Blessed Mother and those of her earthly mother, who attempts to reconcile what her daughter is saying versus what the townsfolk and authorities expect. We are able to see how faith plays out in the lives of the masses and how large groups react in certain situations.

2480953,4,B000E1MXTG,"This movie deeply affected me when I saw it on black-and-white television in the 1960s. I still can't watch it without a lump in the throat.

True, the film has many deficiencies:

- Preposterous liberties have been taken with the basic story to make it conform to the tastes of early '50s Hollywood. They even get the date of the first vision wrong! The top-billed star of the movie (Gilbert Roland, as ""Hugo"") plays a character that never existed. Many other characters have been added, deleted or conflated to suit the drama at the expense of accuracy. Some artistic license is to be expected, but this script crosses the line into disrespect for history.

- The major cast members don't look or sound Portuguese at all, especially the three children, who look as if they were cast from a Sunday school class in Kansas.

- Although most of the cast (including Angela Clarke, as Lucia's mother) perform with reasonable taste and restraint, a few major players are completely out of control. Frank Silvera (Administrator Artur dos Santos) snarls, grinds his teeth and chomps his cigar like a mustache-twirling silent movie villain. Sherry Jackson (Jacinta) bursts into tears at the slightest provocation. She spends half the movie bawling!

- The conversations between Lucia and the Lady have been recklessly scrambled and abridged. This may be one reason why the real Lucia didn't like the movie when it was shown to her.

Thankfully, none of these problems are enough to destroy the powerful sense of wonder and vindication at the end. And Max Steiner's Oscar-nominated choral score captures the otherworldliness of the visions with haunting grace.

The long-awaited DVD is sharp and free from scratches and dust, but the color is very odd. Sometimes the hues are vividly hyper-saturated and garish, other times pale and muddy. These were apparently common characteristics of the early-50s WarnerColor process. Aspect ratio is 1.33:1 as photographed, with monaural sound.

Whether or not you believe that the events at Fatima were manifestations of the divine, this flawed but heartfelt production demonstrates beyond any doubt the nobility and beauty of this mysterious story.",1232841600,4,2180,5.121126760563381

Facing persecution by family, friends, and the newly established atheist socialist government, the drama shows how timely events unravel their significance in human and spiritual history.

As a film it is above average for selection, acting, and development.  The children's key performances are mostly heartfelt.  Susan Whitney is particularly convincing as Lucia, but Sherry Jackson as Jacinta is nearly as believable. Gilbert Rolland plays Hugo, a hearty but well-meaning skeptic-sinner who offers some needed tenderness for the children.

2481010,4,B000E1MXTG,"Since 1917, the mountain village of Ftima, central Portugal, located on the tableland of Cova Da Iria, southeast of Leiria, has been one of the most famous Marian shrines in the world, visited by thousands of pilgrims annually.

""The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima"" opened with a 'persecution' against the Clerical Orders opposed to the government throwing the priests into prison like common criminals..

On May 23, 1917 and each subsequent month until October, three young peasant children, Lucia dos Santos (Susan Whitney) and her cousins Francisco Marto (Sammy Ogg) and Jacinta Marto (Sherry Jackson) reportedly saw a 'LADY' on a little tree - while playing in the woods - who identified herself as the 'LADY OF THE ROSARY'.

The children's extraordinary event was treated with an attitude of doubt and whole 'skepticism'..but with 'courage' they fought the 'threat' that gripped them from strong opposition from the local authority, the Magistrate (Carl Milletaire) and with 'faith' as with the help of their loyal friend Hugo da Silva (Gilbert Roland) they convinced their 'frightened'

parents (Angela Clarke, Jay Novello, Norman Rice & Frances Morris) giving them with 'truth' a new meaning to life in Ftima.

On October 13, 1917, the Portuguese people understood the radiance of their inspiring story when a crowd (generally estimated at about l00,000) gathered at Ftima and witnessed a 'MIRACULOUS SOLAR PHENOMENON', immediately after the 'LADY' had appeared to the 3 children healing 'lame' and 'blind' people as well.

Photographed in Technicolor and with a sincere screenplay, this beautiful religious film - that I recommend highly - was remarkably intense and profound in thoughts and feelings.

John Brahm's direction had its fine moments and Max Steiner's music - Nominated for Best Scoring of a Dramatic Picture - flourished the screen with sounds of tenderness and sympathy.

The performance of Gilbert Roland and the 3 peasant children were entirely moving and convincing..throbbing the beat of our heart with deep 'faith', complete 'belief' and loyal 'truth'.

To the readers who are interested in 'Our Lady of Fatima', I can add that after initial opposition, the bishop of Leiria on October 13, 1930 accepted the children's visions as the appearance of the VIRGIN MARY and in the same year, papal indulgences were granted to pilgrims.",1168128000,31,2356,5.24468085106383
2481011,5,B000E1MXTG,"This is terrific!  In fact, it inspired me to learn more about the Miracle at Fatima.  I recently bought a book on the lives of Francisco and Jacinta Marto and was surprised to learn that while they died at a young age, their cousin Lucia lived well into her ninties.  She indeed remained here a while longer, as the Lady said.  I loved Gilbert Roland in this movie and the children too; they all gave wonderful performances.  The people here seem to live very simple and contented lives in spite of World War I and a repressive government. Ironically enough, this government tends to draw more attention to the children and their vision by opposing it.  This is truly in the tradition of The Song of Bernadette, better in a way because there are no heart-wrenching death scenes.  I wish that I could have seen Susan Whitney (Lucia) in other things.  I agree with another reviewer; she was radiant!",1166486400,6,898,4.60377358490566
2481012,5,B000E1MXTG,"First saw this on tv many years ago and have watched the tape I made from it many times. The quality of the DVD was very, very good and looking at the box I see that it was 'renewed' in 1980. The basic story is there, but having read most of what is available on Fatima over many years, and my mother being an adherent of the 'Blue Army' (which was started by John Haffert to oppose the Red Army in line with Fatima's teaching).

The message of Fatima is more relevant today than it ever was. I am a Catholic and nearly all traditional Catholics will tell you that the third 'secret' was not what was revealed by the Vatican in 2000 or was it 2001? The  consensus among those who are privy to the third secret (or have drawn the logical inference from many sources)is that it deals with the great apostasy of the Church (which we are in) and it starts from the top down. Malachi Martin on a radio show ""revealed"" the third secret by not stating it himself, but rather confirming a caller's statement that it was that satan would enter into the summit of the Church. Whatever you may think of Martin Fatima foretold that Russia would spread her errors throughout the world  -- which she has. Communism is not dead folks, e.g., in S. America all countries save three are socialistic/communistic! Nearly every country in the world is at least socialistic. That's really what the new world order is, i.e., World Communism! Or a form thereof. To hear who took over Russia in 1917 listen to Benjamin Freedman's speech at the Willard Hotel, Washington D.C. 1961. It will also tell you why we were in WWI, WWII and why we're fighting a war for Israel right now! Pick it up at iamthewitness.com. Or you can read from many books who took over Russia (and still control it by the way) Father Denis Fahey's books: The Mystical Body of Christ in the Modern World, or his: The Mystical Body of Christ and the Reorganization of Society, or The Secret Powers Behind Revolution by Vicomte Leon de Poncins or Behind Communism by Frank L. Britton. As a Catholic I'm sure I don't agree with Texe Marrs on a lot of things but his video: Illuminati, Mystery Babylon is absolutely right on the money. Don't let the title throw you, if you're a Catholic (or Christian with your faith)and believe in the Miracle of Fatima this is for you. You don't have to buy this video simply type in google video on your address bar and then from google video type in Texe Marrs and pick this title out of several of his that are listed. And pass this link on to your Christian brethren!

Yes, I'd like to see Mel Gibson do a remake on this. I consider this movie, i.e, The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima and The Passion of the Christ the two best Christian movies out there!",1156723200,11,2736,4.401185770750988
2481013,2,B000E1MXTG,"Shot in the spectacularly crappy WarnerColor system, the unconvincing color is the least of the credibility problems with The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima, in which any relationship to the real events at Fatima in 1917 is purely accidental (no mention of any secrets here). The kind of film that gives atheism a good name, it could probably convert the Pope to the ranks of the unbelievers so outrageously heavy-handed is its Hollywood piety. But more bizarre than the clich&eacute;d sentimentality is the fact that this isn't a film about faith at all but an astonishingly crude and cynical McCarthy era bit of anti-Communist propaganda - hey folks, even God hates Commies! The one surprise is the outright hostility with which the local Catholic priesthood is depicted: disbelieving, antagonistic and clearly doing everything possible to hush things up to protect their jobs and to avoid giving the cartoon commies an excuse to persecute them again, it does hint that someone somewhere along the production line wanted to do something a bit more daring before the saccharine won out. The fact that the film's real-life leading character saw the film and didn't like it says it all.

The DVD transfer copes as well as can be expected with the vagaries of the color system, though some interior shots are particularly grainy and unnaturalistic. The only extra is the original theatrical trailer.",1150416000,,1396,5.043290043290043

I own this film, a gift from my brother, and as I write this review my eyes are full of tears.  You do not have to be a catholic or even a believer of the virgin Mary, but this film is a honest and simple telling of what happened in a small Portuguese village in 1917.
