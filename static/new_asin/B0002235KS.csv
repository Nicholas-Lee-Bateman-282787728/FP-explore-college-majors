I wonder why this is? but I highly recomend this movie to any action junkie, It's been along time since ive seen an actual good action movie.",1109980800,,378,4.573529411764706
2054695,5,B0002235KS,"For someone who is critical of ""action"" movies, this one really surprised me. It's one of those rare finds in the genre where the viewer is not required to completely suspend all beliefs of reality and logic. The story is well conceived of(albeit not undone before). The head of a transnational crime ring is being transported for trial. En route, the motorcade is attacked and forced to retreat to a cargo warehouse where a robbery is taking place. Now the criminals must work together with the police and the seurity guards in order to fight for survival. The performances are great and the action intense and suspensful. A great find.",1107129600,7,637,4.8
2054696,5,B0002235KS,"This understated piece of French action film is actually an excellent and uncompromising movie, and one of the very best action flicks in the past few years.  It is a little bit odd that, even though the movie is mostly a remade of Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13, it is to The Magnificient Seven that explicit references are being made.",1102204800,4,340,4.666666666666667

2054698,5,B0002235KS,"I had no prior knowledge of this movie other than seeing the dvd at Best Buy.  I was able to rent a copy and was supremely pleased with the results.  This is a high caliber action movie that was extremely gripping from start to finish with many surpises along the way.  The pace was relentless with high octane action set pieces from start to finish.  Not a lot of dialogue, but this is the type of movie that Hollywood is always trying to make and usually fails after blowing 100 million.  You will not be disapointed!!!",1099612800,10,521,4.385416666666667

2054710,1,B0002235KS,"Im crazy about action movies, i enjoy them alot. and my favourite actor is the action star Bruce Willis, and so i always look for action movies all over..
So when i stumbled upon this movie here in Amazon, and read all the positive reviews that praise it and some reviewers who though that this is better than Hollywood action movies, i was more than excited to watch it and i immediately bought it, and i wish i haven't !!
This movie really sucked, it was below average and had nothing special to add to the action movie genre..
the Characters were shallow, i did not feel like caring about any of them, no character development at all..
The plot was also, very simple and had nothing special about it..but im sure many would think..why would we care about character development or plot in an action movie ?? just give us the action ... well, even the action here sucked..
In many action scenes here, you don't really see what happens, just people jumping and trying to avoid getting shot, people shooting blindly..meaning shooting through broken glass..
they never show us who the bad guys really are, we are just stuck with the good guys as they strugle inside a warehouse and keep peeking through bullet holes or broken glass..so there is a lack of thrills associated with the bad guys or villians !
The gun power here seemed lame and the gun shot sound effects were terrible and made the movie seem lame..
In summary, don't waste your money on this, i really wanted to like it but i failed to see what is so good about it, im sorry but Hollywood action movies are superior to this awful mess..
I can recommend hundreds of action movies over this, but to make it short i found all the following action movies better than this :

2054711,5,B0002235KS,"I would have never guessed it from the bad DVD cover art and blurbs, but this is a really well-crafted, very engaging and appropriately violent French action film.  The plot concerns a multicultural quartet of thieves, two security guards and three armed escorts who have to join forces to defend themselves trapped in a wherehouse, but, as in all action films, that's just a pretext for the shoot-outs that follow.  It has a good mix of cliches and original ideas, all extremely well-done, with top-notch production values, and superb actors in the leads.  What more do you want from an action film?

Be warned that the English subtitles are actually captions.  There's a dubbed version too (which I didn't bother listening to) and Spanish subtitles (not captions).",1168560000,,766,5.0
2054712,4,B0002235KS,"Before directing very violent, intense, and entertaining Bruce Willis action flick `Hostage' Florent Emilio Siri made a better action that is more violent, intense and entertaining back in France. The film's name is `Nid de gupes' or `The Nest.'

You need to wait a little before the film gets really into gear for it spends some time for character development. `The Nest' starts with three fragmentary stories that will get together later in the middle. One is about an elderly guard going to work; another is about a group of young people humming the theme song of `The Magnificent Seven'; the last is about a police van and the special unit that is carrying a mobster who sits calmly like Hannibal Lector.

In an isolated warehouse near a deserted canal, the three parties meet each other after the heavily-armed terrorists attack the van to retrieve the mobster. In a hopeless situation that would easily remind you of one John Carpenter classic, the aged guard, the police and the small-time thieves join their force to defend the makeshift fort to survive the night.

The premise is similar to `Assault on Precinct 13' (which was incidentally remade by another French director Jean-Franois Richet), and `The Nest' is as violent as the 2005 remake of Carpenter classic. The desperate situation of those who are trapped inside the building is enhanced by the clever use of camera that seldom reveals the faces of the assassins, and of the isolated location that convinces you that there is little chance of survival.

But the most impressive part of `The Nest' is its very intense, almost war-like amount of bullets that are used in the action sequences, which reminded me of the climax of Clint Eastwood's action `The Gauntlet.' Like the bullet-ridden body of the bus of that film, the actions of `The Nest' may sound too loud, but I enjoyed watching them for what they are. The actions are certainly long, but never lose its astonishing power.

Acting is also first-rate. Beautiful and cool Nadia Fars (`The Crimson Rivers') is stunning as the leader of the police unit, and Benot Magimel (`The Crimson Rivers 2' `The Piano Player') and Samy Naceri (known as the taxi driver in the original `Taxi' series) are both superb as the thieves who went into the wrong place at the wrong time.

`The Nest' is a real treat for any action film fans. The setting is improbable, the ending a little confusing, and most of the shoot-outs very violent, but that gritty attitude makes the film more attractive than any other recent action films.",1152403200,2,2536,4.8452655889145495
2054713,4,B0002235KS,"The buildup at the beginning is excellent...not sure who is who...what is what...then it all starts to come together or rather...unravel. It holds your attention.

I found Assault on Precinct 13 to be rather tedious after awhile...couldn't wait for it to finish. Not so this French flick. This is how a film of this genre should be made. IMHO.

Lots of good action...very well done....lots of violence.

Assault on Precinct 13 is VERY Hollywood.",1140566400,2,445,4.986486486486487
2054714,5,B0002235KS,"This film has an almost similar plot to John Carpenter's `Assault on precinct 13': An elite group of judicial escorts (transporting in an armoured vehicle an ultra dangerous mobster to stand trial) and a bunch of petty thieves end up in a remote hi tech factory and join forces (including the factory's security guards) to survive when an army of dangerous and ruthless mafia assassins will do anything to free their captured leader. The director conjures up desperation, hopelessness and genuine evil from his group of characters as well as successfully re-creating Carpenter's feeling of an unstoppable army out to get them.

From the start, where thieves and cops prepare their missions, to the last minute where under siege, the cops, security guards and thieves desperately and relentlessly fight to keep themselves alive, this film doesn't let go. It has it all: Intelligent script, incredible suspense, spectacular action, genuine almost unbearable tension, excellent character development, top notch actors and acting and it's beautifully filmed. It also features one of the most impressive long single shot in cinema history (yes in history!) where the camera travels above a car crash on a highway involving at least 70 cars slowly revealing the horrible carnage bit by bit to end on a close up that will send chills down your spine and prepares you for the horror to come.

For DVD collectors, a better French DVD edition can be found on Amazon.fr as a 2 discs version which includes a plethora of extras. Although not mentioned on the site, it has a French 5.1 soundtrack as well as English, French and Arab subtitles.

Until someone does a decent remake of `Assault on precinct 13' this is an exciting, stylish, unmissable first rate film for action/thriller lovers. Get it you will not be disappointed!",1137888000,3,1816,5.046666666666667

2054716,4,B0002235KS,"This movie is a great French action film. It takes quite a basic plot and turns it into a descent overall movie, not just a shoot em up. There is enough character development and great action scenes ( plenty of them too!) For those interested in foreign and/or action films pick this up. Also, for those of you who previusly wrote reviews asking why the soldiers sometimes speak to each other in english, that is because one of the three soldiers (the one in different camouflage) is German and they communicate with him using english.",1127865600,2,535,4.6421052631578945
2054717,5,B0002235KS,"If you have seen Attack on Precinct 13, then you are familiar with the basic story. But what was surprising about the Nest is that the French managed to turn this formulaic plot into a great movie. It starts out a little slow, but after about 20 minutes, I couldn't take my eyes off it. There were maybe 40 bad guys killed in this movie - a little excessive, since the setting is not Vietnam or WWII. But if you enjoy fast-paced action movies and don't mind subtitles, then the Nest is definitely worth watching.",1127347200,4,512,4.4

A lot of action, gun fights etc, that were pretty entertaining. But as I watched it a couple of questions came to mind. 1) Why do the soldiers speak in english at random moments? and 2) does this not seem like the exact same plot to Assault on Precinct 13???? I mean c'mon, cops and thieves stuck in the same building, having to work together to fend off a force of bad guys trying to rescue their boss. Hmmmmmm.

8020128,5,B0002235KS,"Not really a 5 star movie, but I really like this action flick starring Nadia Fares. It has suspense, thrills action and at the end we see why in French the title is Le Nid de Guepe, watch the movie you'll see. Currently unavailable for streaming, at least on Netflix and Amazon, as of 5/Dec/2014. I took a chance when I first rented this disc, and although it started a little slow it got better, the first part of the movie shows the back story, it gets better from there. The dialogue is in and odd combination of French, Italian and English, mostly French. It is a story of how a group of thieves and an Elite police unit are forced to band together to save themselves and their interrelationships. A great action movie for those who like foreign movies and are able to read subtitles.

8020131,4,B0002235KS,"Originally saw this movie late night on cable, and it stuck with me, so much that I had to buy a copy.  And, every now and again I pull it down and watch it again.

The actual French name is Wasp's Nest.  And its very apt.  The story is several stories that collide - violently.  First, a Prison Transport is moving The Top Gangster to another location. Second, Top Gangsters henchmen set out to free him.  Third, there's this warehouse in the middle of nowhere with a couple of zoned out Watchmen.  Fourth, a group of Thieves set out to steal stuff in the warehouse.  Subsequently, everyone ends up at the warehouse to the great surprise of everyone.  Each group has to figure out whose side they're on and what to do about it.  This is the ultimate bad day had by all.

This is a dubbed movie.  However, the dialogue is so little of the story that you don't even notice.  And, I've never seen that much ammunition used even in a war movie.

It has a clever start which moves to unbelievable action in a gripping story. No character development or sex - just plot and action.  It may not fit most peoples taste, but I like it.",1347753600,,1127,4.3

8020134,4,B0002235KS,"I knew THE NEST was going to be a cool watch when an early scene had the gang of thieves en route to a heist in a humongous warehouse complex... and they're whistling the theme song to The Magnificent Seven. It's a nice touch, and zests up what otherwise is a plodding though necessary set-up. Most of us perhaps associate French cinema with pretentious, high-brow pictures, but these guys can occasionally crank out the sizzling action thriller.

THE NEST (a.k.a. ""Nid de gupes"") falls in that same highly entertaining, extremely watchable mold.

In its essence THE NEST is an amped-up version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assault-on-Precinct-13/dp/B001KEGR8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assault on Precinct 13</a>&nbsp;(the original) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rio-Bravo-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000O599WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rio Bravo (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. This is an ensemble cast, so I wouldn't say that there's one straight out lead character. But my lips twitch a bit in appreciation when I see the beautiful Nadia Fares taking on the John Wayne role. Calm, cool, collected, and spitting out dialogue in French, English and Italian, Fares is convincing as the lead officer in a joint police operation tasked with transporting an Albanian crime lord to his trial in Strasbourg.

It's not spoilering diddly when I mention that the police armored vehicle doesn't make it to its destination. The task force gets ambushed and forced to hole up in a warehouse, high profile prisoner in tow. Sucks for the gang of thieves who'd just about pulled off their caper but now find themselves trapped and caught in the unrelenting crossfire. This sets up an unlikely alliance.

Samy Naceri (of TAXI fame) is the most recognizable actor and he's got a good, small part. The rest of the cast are also solid, and I'm particularly pointing out the sexy Nadia Fares and Pascal Greggory who plays a resourceful night watchman. Pascal Greggory has a face that belongs on a bad guy and he's got a presence about him and makes you believe that the character he plays nurses a pretty interesting backstory. Angelo Infanti as the crime lord doesn't get a lot of dialogue - in fact, dialogue is pretty sparse in this film - but he exudes sheer menace and, oooh, you're just raring for him to get his.

THE NEST achieves this tunnel-vision sensibility. Enough characterization and side stories get thrown in so that it doesn't start feeling like a video game, but the focus stays primarily on point: on the tiny besieged crew trying to survive wave after wave of heavily armed gunmen. It adds to the mounting tension that these gunmen all have on night vision headgear, this element of facelessness making them even more alarming. The pace is relentless. Bullets fly with abandon and tear everything up. The sense of desperation is palpable. Those confined in the warehouse, the cops and the crooks, keep on bickering. The odds are ridiculously stacked against the ""protagonists,"" and I like that the film keeps it as real as it does, and what I mean is that no one pulls a Rambo or a John McClane. You're not sure who makes it out. I think that THE NEST, with its pared down plotting and distilled essence and outrageously high body count, is a superior foreign action film. Yay the French.",1262304000,4,4039,6.043630017452007
8020135,3,B0002235KS,"Being no particular fan of foreign action films, I was pleasantly surprised by ""The Nest,"" which is both competently done and decently paced, with excellent performances from the cast.  Some characters are perhaps underutilized, particularly the intriguing Pascal Greggory (one of the warehouse security guards, who is formerly a fireman). I also wish we'd gotten to see more of Angelo Infanti, the villain, though when he does get some screen time it's memorable.

French actress Nadia Fars is very believable as Laborie (whose FAMAS assault rifle is never far away; I started to see it as an integral part of her character).  She has an almost hypnotic screen presence and a subtle style that expresses much with little effort.  My favorite character had to be Richard Sammel, however, in his bulletproof steel facemask, toting his Steyr AUG with attitude to spare.  Apparently he appears in Daniel Craig's Casino Royale, though I did not remember him from it.

An impressive array of weapons and tactics are on display, against a backdrop that is essentially just the plot of ""Assault on Precinct 13"" done with mostly French people.  As you might expect, under pressure the defenders show their true colors, either for good or for ill, and heroic sacrifices abound as the cast is whittled down.  The body count is very high on the part of the villains, too, who seem to have an endless supply of automatic weapons and glowing red night vision goggles -- not to mention cannon fodder troops who fall like bug-sprayed flies in wave after implacable wave.  One wonders how a single crime boss could inspire such loyalty; you would think the contingent of bad guys surrounding the warehouse would get very tired of getting shot dead in each attempt to penetrate the perimeter.

I didn't particularly care for the way the movie wraps up; obviously the filmmakers tried to be clever in showing you who lives and who dies, but I found it less than satisfying and at times a little confusing.  Still, this is a decent action movie that is worth watching, if you don't mind subtitles (the version I've seen was with the origianl predominantly French dialogue and English subtitles, though Richard Sammel's character speaks English a few times).  I was expecting the usually disappointing, low-budget foreign fare and got a much better film instead.",1258934400,2,2342,4.961636828644501
