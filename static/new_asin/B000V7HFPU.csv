8217122,2,B000V7HFPU,"I've only seen one of the three features on this set previously on videotape (the first ""America's Greatest Roller Coaster Thrills in 3-D""), and I must say it is one of the better roller coaster videos--for almost every coaster covered, you get a general overview as well as a ""first-person"" view from the front car for the entire ride. And the 3-D effect was pretty good. The problem with this set, which is why I gave it only two stars, is that while the first two discs are ostensibly in 3-D, you don't get any glasses with it. The back cover claims the video features ""incredible depth perception optical illustions when viewers wear 3D glasses!"", but there are different types of 3-D glasses (red/green or polorized), so I doubt that many people are just going to happen to have a couple of extra (and compatible) 3-D glasses lying around. A 3-D video without the glasses is, quite simply, not in 3-D. I'd call the title of this set very misleading.",1199232000,4,954,4.617647058823529
