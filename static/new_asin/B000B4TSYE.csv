8081365,3,B000B4TSYE,"Mind killer is one of those great forgotten direct to video 80s gems. The story is totally wacky and bizarre. A nerdy librarian finds a manuscript about mind control and puts into practice what he learns,(with gooey gory results of course). working with an obvious low budget, mind killer still succeeds. I was never bored watching this. Mind killer draws from other b movies such as the manster and fiend without a face giving it that fun low budget horror spirit. This won't ever top anybodys horror movie list but for what it is it works. Would make a great double bill with the video dead.",1318636800,2,593,4.60377358490566
8081366,1,B000B4TSYE,"This movie was completely and utterly stupid. I rented it at a Hollywood Video and was expecting a good bad b movie, but all i got was a bad b movie. If i remember it right, a guy watches a tv program and notices he can read minds, then as he continues to watch it, he can cause things to move and so on. His friend is a total nerd, and in the middle of the movie gets turned into a dog boy, what? Then he almost chops his friends fingers off with a paper cuter. At the end of the movie, the guys head gets enormus and shoots out pus and goo in a bathroom scene. With his big head, he starts chasing his girlfriend and then, when you least expected it, his head explodes and a midget, claymation monster comes out and starts running around, then the girlfriend zaps it.",1134777600,2,769,4.065789473684211
