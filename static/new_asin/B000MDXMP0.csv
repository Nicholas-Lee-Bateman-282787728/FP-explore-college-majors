The writers gave her challenges and she met every one of them with awesome vitality and kept me rapt in her GL life for an hour a day. From radio to television, and finally through the Internet, Kim and Guiding Light kept up to speed in the entertainment world.

Then the unforgiveable in movie and TV land happened. Reva-- and Guiding Light-- got older. Right before its viewing audience's eyes, the last show was the end of an era. The longest running television show in television history was put out to pasture.

Storylines of Guiding Light dealt with many real-life situations: hiring the first disabled person, who played Ed Bauer's mother, Bert; the rapes (by Roger Thorpe) and how the women survived; the sudden appearance of a son who had been adopted and treated with cruelty (Jonathan); ambitious women like Alexander and Beth who learned to ""know no shame"" and went after what they wanted; teenage/single women and pregnancy; cancer survivors; getting involved in community in real life and on screen; and the real life pains of taking the show to its final broadcast with a dwindling budget because a large company (Proctor and Gamble) decided to down-size. Even Alan Spaulding could not wheel and deal his way out of this one. True to character, Kim's alter-ego kept us guessing right to the end: Josh or Jeffry?

When P & G took the longest-running program in the history of entertainment off the air, it was a sad commentary to the United States lifestyle of casting off the old, the experienced, and banishing it's elders as if they never existed.

Thanks Kim Zimmer, for the many years you came into my living room and shared your Guiding Light. I hope you are enjoying greener pastures. Just as P & G tossed you all aside, I now read the labels more carefully through my bespeckled eyes, and I do not buy their products any more.",1282348800,2,1974,4.696531791907514
8168077,5,B000MDXMP0,"While Guiding Light had the dastardly Roger Thorpe in the Scandal Years, they also had a character who was the complete opposite--Reva Shayne Lewis. Her portrayer is the colorful Kim Zimmer who won four Emmys for this role. As Reva, she was quite an unforgettable character, the center of the party, and an attention seeker always searching for love. She found it in husbands and of course, her soul-mate, Joshua Lewis (played by Robert Newman). As a couple onscreen, they complimented each other. Reva has had her shares of excitement and she was never dull. She was complicated, multi-faceted, and of course entertaining. The clips show her wedding to Josh in the country. The tape was done in the 1990s before DVD and the show's declining ratings. Kim Zimmer's Reva proved to be a character that you couldn't describe in a few sentences. She was full of heart and love and always meant well for her family onscreen.",1253404800,2,918,4.8164556962025316
