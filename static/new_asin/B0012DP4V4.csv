8245188,5,B0012DP4V4,"Four and a half INFORMATIVE Stars. This ""Nature Parks"" video is the long version of two Global Television videos that concern the Badlands of South Dakota. This video does cover the ""Badlands State Park"". It begins showing the view of the Badlands from lookout points where visitors are walking along the designated paths. This video shows many views of the area with a voiceover and appropriate music to support it: giving the geological origins of the area going back 80 million years ago when the area was covered by water and 500,000 years ago when the effects of weather and rivers began to cut through the rock, in the cycle of ""deposit and erosion"". There are 56 varieties of unique grasses and the park has been home to many ancient unique creatures of the past many of whose fossils have be found here. The video covers the Cretaceous and Eocene geologic periods. It shows the park's ring road, addresses 9 vantage points, including the ""Conata Basin Overlook"", the ""Yellow Mounds Overlook"", and the other most popular lookout points in the Northern Section. The video also covers fossils, the savanna and other plant life, animals of the past and present such as the bison, and the striped appearance of the rock showing the different colored geologic strata layers within the conical rock. The park is said to be 96,000 hectares (about 370 square miles) There are comments during the video on the treatment of Native Americans and the massacre at Wounded Knee, about 25 miles away, that seem out of place, as does terms like 'paleface' that seem to have been edited into what is otherwise a very good view of the park in general. Highly Recommended for an extensive look at and for the history of the Badlands National Park of South Dakota. Produced by Global Television and directed by Frank Ullman.

8245190,1,B0012DP4V4,"This is a video made to drive you away from ever seeing this National Park. The videographer plops down at one of the vistas and proceeds to pan from left to right - then move on to do the same again. The narration is droning and repetitive while the music is trying to be Native American computer generated. The video quality is better on my cell phone. Skip this and see the real thing - it's a wonderful place at sunrise. Oh, the footage on this video is exactly repeated on other travel videos seen on Amazon. It's crappy there, too.",1411516800,,537,4.326732673267327
8245191,2,B0012DP4V4,"The Badlands are magnificent.  This video was a good twenty minutes too long, short on Geology, long on progressive buffalo chips.  Several corrections that need to be made:  the badlands are inhospitable to man and animal alike.  There is no water, so this was not a place where the indians hunted wild game or where early white settlers tried to make a living.  No water, no life.  The indians did use the badlands as a place to get away from soldiers, they knew the topography and the soldiers didn't, so it made it an excellent place to hide.  The problem was, they had to bring in there own food and water, not just for themselves, but for their animals as well.  Second correction:  There were not 390 men women and children killed at wounded knee, there weren't even three hundred and ninety people in the party that spent the night at wounded knee.  There were approximately 146 men, women and children buried at wounded knee, we know this because the government paid the people of Pine Ridge a dollar a body to bring the frozen corpses to the mass grave dug three days later (there was a blizzard and frigid cold for two days following the battle).  50 to 60 more wounded died of their wounds at Pine Ridge where a makeshift hospital was set up in a church for the wounded.  Remarkably, two or three babies were found alive, under their dead mothers, after two days of frigid weather.  One was adopted by an officer and raised as his own daughter.  No one is sure how many indians escaped, there were reports for several week afterward from Pine Ridge and lower Brule agencies of small numbers of indians showing up at the agencies.  The actual number of men, women and children killed at wounded knee is somewhere around 220.  Whether 220 or 390, the killing of women and children is indefensible and Colonel Forsythe should have been court marshalled, not because he ordered the killing of innocent women and children, but because he bunched his soldiers so close to the the indian encampment, that after the first shot was fired (by a brave who shot an officer in the face at point blank range), all hell broke loose.  Most of the women and children died within the camp when one pound shells from the four hotchkiss guns exploded and shrapnel cut them to pieces.  Some of the 25 soldiers killed and 50 wounded were also victims of this indescriminate fire.  Wounded Knee is south of the badlands, I don't understand why they left you with the impression it was part of the badlands.  It really burns my biscuits when innocuous National Parks videos inject lies and innuendo into something that should make people want to visit the park, not feel guilty because their skin is white.",1407369600,,2694,4.6079664570230605
