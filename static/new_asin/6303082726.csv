552465,5,6303082726,"This was a wonderful family movie. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy worked some magic in this film. A serene kind of familial wonder exists in this picture.  You will walk away from this movie feeling good about the good in human kind. The movie shows very creatively that love can live on many years after the death of a loved one, and sometimes enriches ones spirituality.  Jessica, you were a very special actress.

I also recommend ""Driving Miss Daisy""

552466,5,6303082726,"Shortly after celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, Sam Peek loses his beloved wife Cora to a heart attack.
Told from the perspective of his son James, this heart touching story tells of Sam and his family. One day shortly after Cora's death, a snow white dog shows up on Sam's porch. Sam grudgingly feeds and eventually takes the dog in. The problem is, when he tells his children about the white dog, they think he is losing his mind because only Sam can see it. The dog stays with Sam and becomes his constant companion. Eventually, he realizes that the dog is really Cora, back to take care of him through his last days.
A heartwarming and sometimes humorous story of everlasting love. It never fails to bring a tear to my eys.",1088294400,17,737,4.548872180451128
552467,5,6303082726,"This movie is deeply touching. The dog is gorgeous. The acting is high-quality. This is an embarrassingly short review, but there really is nothing more to say, except, ""See this great film!""",1081555200,8,191,5.0
552468,5,6303082726,"I just happened to be perusing the ""Drama"" shelf at my local Blockbuster when I saw this movie that obviously looked as though this old man's beloved wife died and returned to him as a beautiful white dog. Naturally I thought of my other favorite reincarnated dog-person movie, ""Fluke,"" which was made 2 years after this film. So I rented the Hallmark video and watched it. The story was original, touching, and moved quickly enough. It was sweet and mysterious but simple enough to understand. It wasn't at all a bore. I loved it. The old man was endearing, the dog was gorgeous, the children were annoyingly caring, it had romance and suspense and sadness. This movie was truly worth it. What a lovely film.",1062892800,6,709,4.68
552469,5,6303082726,"Sometimes a work ""made for TV"" suffers from cast from B minus List, and cheesy-quicky idea borrowed from somewhere else -- like a huge meteo coming from the outer space -- but very often it produces a genuinely good one, and now here's one for you.
Sam and Cora is a typical American husband and wife, long lived in a country pecan farm in Georgia, with daughters near them and sons already got their own jobs.  But now Sam is left alone, after a death of his wife, but he finds a new friend in a white dog which seems to come out of nowhere.  But one strange thing is that though Sam can see her, touch her, feed her, and even dance with her, no one else doesn't seem to see  this dog.  Is it his illusion?  Or something else?
Terry Kay's original book is treated with a subtle touch to realize a magic feeling in an ordinary life, and the relations  between his worried family members and confident Sam himself are marvelously drawn with a snappy dialogues.  Naturally, the acting from the two veterans is always first-rate, with Hume Cronyn as Sam (who got Emmy Award), and Jessica Tandy as Cora (nominated for Emmy but with a little more screen time, she could have won).  And the fact that these actors were really married for a long time, and by the time of shooting this film Jessica tandy got a diagnosis as having cancer makes the whole picture more precious and gives a bitter-sweet taste to it.
The latter part of the film is, frankly speaking, I found a bit weak, the story being streched (especailly the episode about the river should be deleted, being out of tune), and the film tends to speak the things that should be left unsaid.  The final result, however, is more than satisfactory, proving that those veteran actors are true American cinematic treasures.  Recommended.
By the way, the original book has become suddenly a bestseller in Japan in 2001 and 2002, and more than 1.5 million copies have been  sold.  And to capitalize in the popularity, they quickly made a film of this book with all-Japanese cast.",1020556800,43,2028,4.526027397260274
552470,4,6303082726,"The movie, ""To Dance With The White Dog"" is a story of enduring love.  The mixture of humor and sadness in this film leave one with a feeling of warm satisfaction.  Sam Peek, played by Hume Cronyn, is famous for his nursery in Georgia. Shortly after his wife, Cora, played by Jessica Tandy, dies a white dog, presumably possessed by Cora's spirit, appears to protect Sam.  The scenery in this movie is superb.  The viewer feels almost as if they are on an old Georgian pecan farm where the doors slam, birds chirp, and crickets sing.  This movie has a wonderful cast from Cronyn and Tandy, to their overprotective daughters, Kate and Carrie, played by Christine Baranski and Amy Wright, sons James and Paul, played by Frank Whaley and Perry Beaver.  Their authentic southern dialect and use of idioms also add to this timeless classic.  The auditory effects are excellent. The creaky doors, the old truck that sputters to a stop, and the sound of the cicadas and the frogs at night bring the viewer to a warm southern evening in Georgia.  Because of its sadness I rate this movie a 9/10. Great acting combined with a timeless story and fresh, country setting, make it a wonderful movie to watch with the whole family.",990489600,6,1217,4.654205607476635
552471,5,6303082726,"When Sam's beloved wife Cora tells him she will always be there for him, she keeps her promise. After being married for 50 years, Cora has a heart attack and leaves Sam alone dealing with his own ailing health, or so he thinks.

When a beautiful white dog appears, everyone starts to worry. The white dog is only visible to Sam. Slowly the dog becomes visible to all the family members. When Sam is in trouble, the white dog is always there for him.

In a movie dealing with the issue of life and death, I found it insightful of the writers to describe death as a new adventure instead of an ending. Unlike the movie ""Dad,"" this movie is not sad from the start to finish and is much more upbeat. The humor is laugh out loud throughout. His two daughters are always worrying about their dad and get themselves into quite a funny predicament. Life should be filled with humor and good times.

Death is sad because we feel sorry for ourselves and miss the relationship we had. The person leaving this life is starting on their new spiritual journey in eternity. Hume Cronyn gives an inspirational performance and seems to have brought much of his own wisdom to the character of Sam. Character is something that makes an actor good. It is conveyed through the acting and is never masked by it.

Watching this type of movie will help you to discover your own feelings and beliefs about real-life issues and it will deepen your awareness to those around you who need your love and attention. When it comes down to it, Sam has his family and his beliefs. His wisdom seems to guide him in life and he looks for the good in life.

When you seek out good in life, it keeps finding you!

552472,5,6303082726,"I spent the day watching Mission Impossible 2, I like action movies.  When my wife wanted us to watch this movie I was not that interested at first, but she said it was short so I buckled under.  That was the best thing I ever did!  If our house catches fire this will be the first thing I rescue.  We were so moved by the film that when it ended we knelt on the floor, hugging each other tightly and crying our eyes out.  It reminded us so much of how much we love each other.  If this movie does not tear at your heartstrings, then nothing will.  I recommend this to everyone who has ever loved anyone.",977702400,5,604,4.067796610169491
552473,5,6303082726,"America's premier acting couple, Hume Cronyn and Jessia Tandy, are wonderful in this simple story about love transcending death.  This, I believe, was the last time that the two worked together and their real  affection for each other is felt in every scene that they shared.  One of  the best of the Hallmark Hall of Fame productions, ""Dance"" is a  quality drama that should be required viewing for all aspiring  actors.
This pair shows you how it's done.  My only regret is that I  missed the chance to meet the couple when they were filming some scenes for  the show in my area years ago.
I was too busy writing a research paper  that I have since forgotten.  But, forget their performance...NEVER!",960163200,,701,4.663934426229508
