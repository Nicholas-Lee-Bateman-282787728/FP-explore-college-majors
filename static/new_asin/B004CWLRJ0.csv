4329194,4,B004CWLRJ0,"A villain plans to take over the world. Two teens ( a boy and his sister ), a spunky aunt, and several very humorous characters work against him. I viewed this movie twice! The story moved at a good pace and held my attention throughout. The young teens are sweet, smart, and savvy. One minor character who is learning to speak English uses the word damn at the beginning but he quickly gets over that. The three females in the story are the sweet teen, her strict aunt, and the singer, Miss Missy. I also loved the amusing role of the dog. While viewing this DVD, I saw first rate animation. Children watching this film will feel empowered by the action of the teens and all will enjoy the humor. The adults will be entertained as well.",1307923200,3,737,4.386861313868613
4329195,1,B004CWLRJ0,Absolutely awful!  Very misleading.  By the cover of the movie you would think this is for children...but what parent wants their children to watch a movie with foul language in it?  I was shocked.  TVG wouldn't work on the movie so I didn't bother waiting to see if there was anything more offensive.  We turned it off and regret that we ever rented it.,1307318400,2,354,4.46875
4329196,4,B004CWLRJ0,"I will say that some of the other reviews here puzzle me. Objecting to a western because there
are guns and fist fights seems extremely odd and prudish.  Honestly there's nothing in this film
that can compare with what you see everyday on network TV. It is after all an innocent cartoon.

This is a fine adventure film for all ages, although probably more appropriate for younger viewers
(ages 6-12) as its basic message is ""be good, be courageous, and save the world"". The settings are
often beautiful, there are some nice action sequences, and the animation is quite accomplished as well.

This is an imaginative film made in Europe, slightly slower-paced than the usual Hollywood action-packed
blockbuster, so it might be appreciated more by those with sophisticated tastes. Also, a European
perspective takes a more comprehensive view of life for children, even in a cartoon fantasy.

The film is based on a very famous and beloved Belgian comic series called ""Bob & Bobette/Suske & Wiske"",
and has elements that are similar to the ""Tintin"" books, which are also Belgian. The series evokes
an affectionate and humorous take on the adventures of an extended and eccentric Belgian family.

Overall, a pretty good western/fantasy/mystery animated film!",1306195200,7,1253,5.092682926829268
4329197,1,B004CWLRJ0,"I was very disappointed with at the violence and swearing.  Got this movie to watch with my 8 year old daughter, and oh, what a mistake!

Turned it off after 15 minutes and should have stopped it before that.  Bad, bad, bad movie.  Not for kids and sorry I rented it.  A total waste of my $1!",1305331200,2,292,4.052631578947368
4329198,1,B004CWLRJ0,I am shocked that someone would make a movie and able to label it a family movie!!! I could not believe my ears when I heard cussing in the movie. Man it was a waste of money!!!,1305244800,2,177,3.810810810810811
4329199,1,B004CWLRJ0,"Absolutely AWEFUL.  We had to turn it off after 20 minutes.  There is cussing, violence (fist fighting), guns, and references to alcohol.  If that wasn't bad enough, the movie itself is really bad and the animation is second rate.  Absolutely skip this one!!!",1305072000,3,259,4.953488372093023
4329200,1,B004CWLRJ0,AWFUL! I totally agree with first reviewer.  Thank goodness I only rented it and did not buy it.  Waste of money even renting from a redbox for only a $1.  Shortly in I stopped it due to the inappropriateness for my two children.  Do not buy unless you like to throw away your money and do not care what your children watch.,1303430400,3,324,4.17741935483871
4329201,1,B004CWLRJ0,"The idea and plot behind this production had potential but the pathetic one liners and predictable situation made it unbearable. The real problem with this movie is the unnecessary use inappropriate language like ""damn damn damn damn damn"" and overtly sexual exploits of some of the female characters. It's ridiculous that some studio would consider this an appropriate venue for this behavior. Buyer beware, this movie is neither appropriate for children or funny for adults.",1303257600,8,476,5.36
8423656,5,B004CWLRJ0,"A couple of caveats: we LOVE westerns, I grew up with the TinTin books handed down to me from my dad, and the word DAMN is not considered one of THE 7 dirty words, nor is it ""bleeped"" on television or regularly censored by the FCC. I'm a broadcaster and it's my job to know this. My 3 year old is not allowed to use that word, but we also do not shelter him from the fact that it exists. Methinks the ever-obnoxious Parent's Television Council got ahold of the reviews on this one. I suggest perusing Amazon for some industrial-strength tongs to remove your underwear from your buttcrack.

That said. Yes, the jokes are corny and some of the language/dialogue is strange, but that's to be expected with a movie that has been translated into English. Why else would they throw the word ""damn"" in there repeatedly? To fill up space. I think the animation is pretty good. The treatment of the brunette as a sex-object does slightly enrage my feminist sensibilities, but if you actually leave to film on until the end, instead of, ya know, turning it off, you'll learn she's the most intelligent character, a cop, and the ""hero."" Which probably makes this one of the more progressive and intelligent children's movies I've seen in a while.

Thank you, Belgium.",1418688000,,1256,4.602678571428571
8423657,5,B004CWLRJ0,"What an absolutely amazing & cute movie.  I saw this on Amazon & knew that I had to get it, not just for me, but for my kids as well.",1409270400,,133,3.433333333333333
8423658,2,B004CWLRJ0,"Meh.  Sub-par animation, oddball storyline, plodding story development...not much to like here.  Turned if off after about 30 minutes when the word ""damn"" was used for the umpteenth time since my 4 & 8 year old kids were watching too.  Sometimes it makes more sense to ditch a movie halfway through instead of enduring til the end - this was one of those times.  Don't bother.",1379289600,,376,4.651515151515151

8423660,3,B004CWLRJ0,"Love or hate their work, Phase 4 films is really doing all they can to establish themselves as a player in the Grade B computer animated feature film segment.  Of course you really can't fault them for understanding that it takes budgets so inflated even our government would blush to attempt to take on Pixar, DreamWorks, Sony Image Works and Bluesky Studios directly; the trouble is their technique of locating foreign made CG films, slapping English over the original dialog track and releasing said dub on DVD generally leaves a lot to be desired too!

Enter 2011's Luke and Lucy the Texas Rangers; a shining (or maybe glaring) example of this process that likely sailed right under your radar.

The film's original title was Suske en Wiske: De Texas Rakkers, which translates to Spike and Suzy: The Texas Rangers in English.  Where ""Luke & Lucy"" came from is anybody's guess.  Released theatrically in July 2009 in Belgium, it was the first in a projected 13-animated film run based on the Belgian comic book characters (published in English as Spike and Suzy and sometimes Willy and Wanda).  Confused yet? Don't be.  All you need to know is Phase 4 brought this Belgian piece to the US, redid the vocals and here we are.

About the biggest problem with Phase 4's take on the material is that it does show promise; something about 99% of films created by this process lack.  The English dub actually works pretty well with the general timing of the piece and even matches mouth flaps fairly successfully.

The trouble is there is some foreign weirdness that no amount of dubbing can make logical.  The core of the story centers on an evil metallic cowboy named Jim Parasite who, by use of powder, has the ability to shrink human beings down to action figure proportions.  And this is precisely what he does to the entire squad of Texas Rangers on his tail at the onset of the film.  He then proceeds to store the shrunken cops in empty whiskey bottles that he has arranged neatly on a shelf in his lair.  If this sounds a bit askew to you, rest assured, it gets much more bizarre from here.

The viewer is then transported to modern day Boston where the titular sibling duo (and a host of truly bizarre family & friends) receive word of the strange happenings going on in Texas via an alcoholic neighbor who opens up a case of what he believes to be ordinary whiskey only to discover a miniaturized human contained within one of the bottles.  At this point in the film you can't help but come to the horrible realization that all of this is supposedly taking place in modern day Texas!

That's right: dusty streets outside the saloon, intermittent tumble weeds, horse-mounted rangers with six shooters and duals at high noon are all apparently daily life in Texas circa 2009 according to this film yet in Boston our cast is playing video games, talking on cell phones... Perhaps it's best to not even ponder such idiosyncrasies lest we have nothing left to talk about.

Once the Boston gang set forth to Texas to solve this strange mystery, we are treated to all sorts of inappropriate behavior- children impersonating police officers, holding people at gunpoint to obtain information, a man closing himself in a refrigerator to have an uninterrupted snack, the sale of alcohol to minors and on and on.  That reminds me, the PG rating this film wears certainly isn't just there for decoration.  The language alone earns the rating thanks to multiple instances of repeated cussing all centered around the word ""damn"".  This is especially dumbfounding considering the ENTIRE dialog track was dubbed into English for the North American market! They couldn't have opted for ""darn"" or ""dang"" considering this thing's supposed to be for kids and all?

Anyway, back to the plot... the film works off the mystery element and, truth be told, could probably give 2011's Adventures of Tintin (Steven Spielberg) a run for the money were it not for the goofiness.  In a strange way, there is a definite connection between the two films (that must be mostly coincidental considering Luke and Lucy was actually released back in 2009 after multiple years of development).  The look of the character models, the abnormally intelligent yet silent dog, the mystery element that leads the young antagonist(s) into far away lands, the pacing that makes the movies feel at least three-times longer than their actual runtimes, it's all present in both.

However, where the paths diverge comes down to some odd choices that will be sure to offend even the most liberal of households in the case of Luke and Lucy.  The tragedy here is that the visuals are well above average, especially in Blu/ high definition.  Textures are rich, models are well animated, and even the English vocal cast does a surprisingly nice job with the dialog (save for the cussing mentioned above).  Considering what the material itself presents, the finished product is unexpectedly coherent.

If you've exhausted the endless stream of quality CG entertainment coming out of the Grade A studios and feel a few slightly inappropriate words coupled to a lot of inappropriate behavior and a plot that borders on utter madness are just what you've been missing, Luke and Lucy the Texas Rangers is a dream come true.",1363824000,,5268,4.815760266370699
8423661,1,B004CWLRJ0,"We turned this off after a few minutes. First a man says ""damn"" repeatedly..which honestly, I couldn't believe that's what he was really saying--he had an accent and this was a CHILDREN""S MOVIE..so I let it go thinking, surely he said something else...NOPE..fast forward a few more minutes and several more damns and dammits....my child has never heard that word before and I'm sorry she had to hear it now. NOT HAPPY. This iS NOT a children's movie!!!!!!!!!!! Only gave it one star because I had to give it something..it doesn't even deserve the one star in my opinion!!",1335916800,4,571,4.777777777777778
8423662,5,B004CWLRJ0,"This movie was enjoyable for my 6 year old and for the adults in our family. Having suffered through watching many kid's films that are agonizing for adults to watch, it was a pleasant surprise to be able to share the enjoyment of this movie with our son. The film is funny, unpredictable, and tells an offbeat tale that hooks you in from the beginning. An added plus is that the animated western scenery is beautiful! I did not find any of the content to be inappropriate for my child.",1332028800,,486,4.411111111111111
8423663,1,B004CWLRJ0,"This movie is rated PG, but I would not let young children watch it. Having a character scream ""Dammit"" several times in a row is a sure way to get your kid to repeat it over and over. Truly terrible. Couple that with the liberal references to alcohol, and the poor production value, and there is really nothing left to like about this train wreck.",1320883200,,348,4.369230769230769
8423664,4,B004CWLRJ0,"This was a lot of fun to watch and looked great as well! We were not familiar with the characters -- apparently they have been much beloved comic book characters for decades in Europe -- but had no trouble jumping right in and enjoying the movie.  A good offbeat choice for all the family.  Some reviewers seemed upset about bad language, but all I heard was ""damn"" a couple of times.",1311292800,4,384,4.394366197183099
