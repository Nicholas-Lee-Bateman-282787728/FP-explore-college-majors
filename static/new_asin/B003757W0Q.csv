So much of it is simply not together, and there are moments here and there that verge on chaos.  On the other hand, conductor Haitink leads the extended instrumental numbers -- the Fidelio overture, and the Leonore III overture, interpolated before the opera's final scene -- very well, and during those moments the band plays together and with commitment.

The singing cast is generally undistinguished; the eloquent Florestan is an exception. Some of the scenography is effective -- the opening of the prison scene, for example -- but a lot of it is just plain silly. The cartoonish portrayal of the evil Pizarro is almost embarassing to watch.  Were I the producer, and had I control independent of financial/contractual issues, I would not have chosen to release it.

The Amazon streaming version, which costs $2 to rent, dispenses with subtitles, alas. So it helps to know the story ahead of time.",1459728000,,1067,5.045454545454546

This was performed in Zurich in 2009. I like it because it has a little more dialog than the old 1978 Vienna with Janowitz, which made me realize Otto Schenk had made some cuts. However, when comparing the two, I would prefer the older one. Because this staging is too minimal, and it is in modern dress. Otherwise the two are almost identical in music.",1413849600,,405,4.486486486486487
8390310,5,B003757W0Q,"Excellent in every way - well sung, well acted, well produced, and well photographed. The acting and singing, I'm sure, captures Beethoven's intent. The playing of the Leonore Overture 3 between the scenes of the second act, while common in recent performances, is a rather long distraction. But it is played well and doesn't really detract from the performance.",1405900800,,362,5.1525423728813555
