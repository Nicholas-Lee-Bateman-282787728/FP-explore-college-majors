8594294,5,B00DLJUL24,"Four and a half SPECTACULAR Stars. This beautiful video, ""Serene Universe"", is by Maarten Roos and it is a series of internal videos and still photographs that takes the viewer on a visual trip from the Earth through the solar system and out into the galaxies and nebulae of the universe, all with a marvelous soundtrack from William Zeitler using differing themes to accentuate the visions on the screen.

The HD photography is truly stunning. But the order of presentation is puzzling since it begins on Earth; then the Earth from space; the Moon; then to Mars and directly to Jupiter and its moons of Io, Europa, and Ganymede, then back towards the Sun to Mercury, Venus, then out to Miranda first and its planet Uranus, Neptune and moon Triton, Ida and Dactyl in the asteroid belt, then comet Hartley 2, Saturn with moons Mimas and Titan, and then back to the Sun. Then going farther out into the cosmos there are beautiful photos of nebulae that may be new to some: Large Megellanic, Orion, Bat, Tarantula, Running Chicken, Carina, Cat Paw, and the CoalSack Cloud. Then a series of galaxies: the familiar Sombrero, the Southern Pinwheel, Hoag's Object, Blackeye, Needle, Centaurus, Dusty, Milky Way, and Darth Vader galaxies. Then galaxy clusters, like Robert's Quartet Galaxies, Pandora's Cluster, Coma Cluster, Arp 87 and Arp 274. Photos and videos are from NASA, ESA, and other sources. This cosmological video contains some beautiful and vivid photos presented with fitting music that changes with the scenarios. If you don't mind the skipping around, you may love ""Serene Universe"". Highly Recommended. Four and a half SUPERB Stars! (Lightcurve films. Color. HD. CC. Time-55:08.)",1465516800,,1689,5.053763440860215

8594297,5,B00DLJUL24,"Serene Universe is a combination of magnificent photography from NASA's explorations (so far) of Earth's near and vastly far neighbors in outer space, and an exquisite musical score that quietly accompanies the viewer's inner attention along the way. I like it very much, for the feeling it brings of being both scientifically -- and astoundingly -- true, and a heartwarming story too. About leaving the place we were born to, for places unknown, and while we're out there exploring new worlds, eventually, fondly, looking back in a whole new way toward home. I'm ordering two more copies for families with children I love, and I recommend Serene Universe for anyone. It's beautiful.",1380412800,,683,5.107142857142857
