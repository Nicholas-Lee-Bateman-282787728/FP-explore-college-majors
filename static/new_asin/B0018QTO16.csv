8270715,5,B0018QTO16,DVD arrived well before the set delivery date in perfect condition. I haven't actually watched the DVD myself to judge the quality but my mom tells me it's great and comes with english subtitles. I bought it for her since it's one of her favorite Bollywood movies and she loves it. It's an old-school Hindi movie about Santoshi Ma - Lord Ganesha's daughter.,1356048000,,357,4.682539682539683
