8583996,5,B001BP4K72,"The story of how three young men made their dream to dance a reality is told in this documentary.  I found it to be inspirational for other Youth, including youth who are involved with juvenile justice system.  There are opportunities in the film to discuss certain topics such as personal goals/dreams; values; leadership skils and characteristics; choices and decision making; success and what it looks like; and what it takes to be successful.  I recommend the documentary to those interested in dance and to those interested in the personal stories of 3 determined and extremely talented youth.",1339286400,,598,5.144329896907217

Good turnaround story of real kids.  My son will keep watching for the great and unique moves.  No Hollywood hype here!  we recommend it highly!",1231632000,,320,4.763636363636364
8583998,5,B001BP4K72,"Marcy Garriott's film, ""Inside the Circle' is worth owning for the incredible dancing alone. These dancers are a cross between Cirque de Soleil performers, and Olympic athletes. Add a riveting and compelling story of three young men trying to find their place in the world, and you have a film you'll want to watch more than once.
  Garriott, weaves a story that follows Josh, Omar and Romeo. These three search for their identities, long for family, compete against each other, and try to not repeat the mistakes of their parents.
  Particularly riveting is Josh. Josh lives at home, gets in trouble, and tries desperately not to end up like his murdered father. Josh's joy ride on a golf cart, a prank that in a better neighborhood would be a funny anecdote over gin and tonics, threatens to destroy his suddenly promising future.
These three boys on the verge of manhood could have very easily found family in a violent gang. Instead they fight their battles, and their demons, inside the dance circle.
  Innovative animation provides transitions between scenes, and the soundtrack makes you want to immediately spin on your head. The film also comes with special features that you will want to view over and over again.",1229299200,,1223,4.884057971014493
8583999,5,B001BP4K72,"This is a kinetic, heartfelt film that jumped off the screen and into my heart.  I've never seen a documentary film explore b-boy culture in such a raw, elegant & emotionally complex way -- Inside The Circle is truly a standout.  You'll want to share it with all your friends!",1222041600,,276,4.5
