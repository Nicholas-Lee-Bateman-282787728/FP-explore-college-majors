1666366,5,B00005UQ9F,"Let me just start by offering you a little something about Danvers MA for those of you elsewhere in the world, particularly those of you who were drawing the ""Blair Witch"" parallells. Danvers is a town of 24,000 people that was founded in the late 1700's. Before it was called Danvers it was known as ""Salem Village"". That's right, as in Witchcraft Hysteria Salem. Now, the Salem that is world famous for the witch trials is still a neighboring city. Thanks to the name, Salem still cashes in on all of the hype and tourism because many of the ""witches"" were actually tried and hanged in Salem the city. But the majority of the hysteria and incidents actually took place right here in ""Salem Village"" where most of the executed people resided, including the famous ""Rebecca Nurse"" whose house still stands on my street. So this town was rich in spooky history long before the Hospital was erected in the 1800's.
It was only fitting that a horror movie be filmed here in this town at some point, especially at DSH (or, as many people in town call it: ""Danvis-tate""). Brad Anderson and Co. did a great job too, it was pretty much everything I could've hoped for. I have been up to hospital several times over the years and it is every bit as scary as the movie portrays it to be. We've heard voices and all of the rest while we've been up there trying to spend the night, etc...perhaps real voices, perhaps imagined. It's an amazing place really, every horror movie element is built right in. There are several great sites around the Web devoted to DSH so I won't get into the factual history. But if you ever try to visit you'll have more than ghosts to deal with, the state police have maintained a presence up there since long before the hospital actually closed for good in 1992. The local gov't wants people to stay away ""for their own safety"" because, for one, the main building is collapsing from within... the floors really are falling right on to one another so it is pretty dangerous...ghosts aside. But that's just fuel for the fire of intrigue.  It's tough to get by the police and security during the day...but at night...well, let's just say they don't tend to be out walking as much. But either way, if you are ever in the Boston Area this stop (or drive-by on Rt. 95 N) is a must. Some of the buffoons that govern this town are always trying to find a reason to tear the place down, likely for condos and all of that nonsense, so, if you find yourself obsessed with this movie, or place, be sure to get up there soon, i can't imagine it being there too much longer. Well I hope this is as much help as a full on movie review. I figure this is more of a select audience anyway. Heck, we've got 26 screens of movie theatres here in Danvers and i had to go into Boston just to see it...so it's obviously a select audience--even here in town! But, despite limited distribution, this WILL be a cult classic, if it isn't already. Cheers!!",1014854400,4,2946,4.435424354243542
1666367,5,B00005UQ9F,The movie Session 9 is in my opinion one of the creepiest films ever. Especially since I worked at the abandoned institute during the filming of the movie. The movie sums up the feeling of the place so perfectly. I could ramble on forever so I'll stop know with this: GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!,1014768000,2,290,4.290909090909091
1666368,4,B00005UQ9F,i remember wanting to see this in the theater so when it came out today i got it. not to much action in the begining but it keeps you wondering whats gonna happen and holds your interest till the end and thinking after the end. i suggest u see this with people who can think and not those who just want to see action and gore so u can really pay attention and get into it.

1666370,5,B00005UQ9F,"well ive been in the hospital the movie was shot at. and that is the most scariest, creepiest, most horrible place ive ever been in.( of course i snuck in ). if you were thinking if was a patient...lol. but yes that place is defiently haunted by all the souls that died in there, and i know from experience. I didn't last 3 hours in there and i was planning on spending the night exploring. and session 9 is a great movie. i saw it in the thearter in august, in cambridge MA. i think it was one of the best movies ive ever seen. but thats my opinon. cause ive been in there, and just seeing the movie is almost like.....being in there with permission, and not getting arrested. but yes if you like haunted places then you should defiently buy this movie.

1666371,5,B00005UQ9F,"and extremely underrated...absolutely unique...one of the best psychological/horror film i've seen in years!.
it is comparable to kubrick's adaptation of ""the shining""...
SESSION 9 is also very convincing...fascinating.
this film gradually transports you into the deranged mind of gordon FLeming (portrayed by petter mullan..aka ""swanney"" of trainspotting,he is also well known for such films as Miss julie, My name is joe , mauvaise passe.)..
gordon,Hank,phil,jeff,mike and bill are an asbestos abatement crew working in a isoltated asylum. is this place haunted?...are they paranoid?...the conclusion of session 9 is ambiguous and chilling.
see this film only if you're a fan of suspense,horror & intelligent films...
session 9 is brad anderson's best film.(so far)..(he also directed ""next stop wonderland"" and ""happy accidents""..etc)...but ""session 9"" is a radical change!
even the dark/ambiant & experimental score works perfectly well with this film.
the entire cast is great!...(especialy David caruso aka ""kiss of death"", ""NYPD Blue"" , ""black point""...) ,hank (played by josh lucas aka ""american psycho"" , ""a beautiful mind"" , ""the deep end"" , ""coast lines"") and Jeff (played by brendan sexton III/ ""welcome to the dollhouse"" , ""hurricane streets"" , ""boys don't cry"" , ""black hawk down""..) are the two most sympathic characters of the film..gordon is the tormented one...
every minutes are a pure pleasure to watch..a MUST SEE!

1666373,3,B00005UQ9F,"The movie follows a small group of hired absestos removers as they spend a week to remove absestos from a shut-down insane asylum, as things fall apart between the workers during the week.
The movie really is great at creeping you out and pushing your buttons.  In fact, the storytelling is done so well that it builds up the tension and makes you think that there's a major surprise in store, as you're wondering which one of the abestos removers is going crazy.
Sad to say, there isn't a major surprise.  The question isn't 'whodunnit?', but rather 'it can't be who I think it is, because that'd be waaayy too obvious and rather lame, but there's no other option', which makes the story rather predictable, and gets nowhere.

1666404,5,B00005UQ9F,"It looms up out of the woods like a dormant beast. Grand, imposing... abandoned and deteriorating, the Danvers State Mental Hospital, closed down for 15 years is about to receive 5 new visitors. From 2001 (wow that seems so long ago) we get a very suspenseful and well paced movie about a group of 5 men hired to get rid of the asbestos in the mental home that has just been bought. (What purpose? not sure I heard). Personally, I would love to visit this place, it does exist or did. This is basically a 5 man movie and there are a lot of sub plots running through it. Are these guys just off the beam or are the being possessed? You tell me. the cast of 5 men are superb (even David Caruso) Peter Mullan, Brendan Sexton 3, Stephen Geveron and Josh Lucas. Bravo on an eerie story, direction and everything else. Really was a nail biter. Caution: this is a slow build up for sure so you have to love the story telling.",1493510400,3,918,4.251428571428572
1666405,5,B00005UQ9F,"My favorite horror film of the 21st Century so far that works as either a psychological thriller or supernatural horror film (though it appears to be weighted toward the latter). Definitely of the slow burn variety (which I prefer) as opposed to the shock-a-second type. Great cast (especially the great and underrated Josh Lucas), direction and cinematography that create a deeply, ominous mood before the scary aspects of the story began to appear. If you're expecting a manipulative, shockfest like the Conjuring or your typical slasher film, you'll probably strongly disagree with my five star rating, but the film has developed a strong, cult following among both critics and horror fans, and I'm definitely among the latter. Go for the Blu-ray version if you can, as it really brings out the film's great, color template.",1493510400,2,827,5.133333333333334

I did get side tracked and did some online shopping about 3/4 of way through and it might have been even scarier at that point.  It was a different type of scary.  Check it out... you can always fast-forward or stop and move on.

The stuff that happened at Danvers is probably scarier.",1484179200,2,353,4.523809523809524

The added in extra features including the looking back at Danvers feature was awesome. This is a truly independent classic and straight up creepy psychological thriller. A true gem in a very saturated genre and still holds up 16 years later.",1482883200,,394,4.642857142857143
1666410,1,B00005UQ9F,"Right off the bat, let me make one thing clear: there is NOTHING scary about this movie.  Period.  NOTHING!  Ill say it again for the cheap seats.  THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!  Oh, did I get ahead of myself?  Sorry, couldn't hold it in any longer.  I just want you all to take note of the fact that THIS MOVIE SUCKS.

The entire movie takes place in the day time; there were a couple of dark scenes in the basement and in the tunnels...and again, nothing happens.  No ghosts, no boogie man, nothing.  And before you say, ""Well, neither did the Blair Witch.""  Well, let me stop you there.  BW at least made you *think* there was something bad out there and it *might* jump out at any second.  This movie, however, didn't even come remotely close to that.  In a word, this movie was HORRENDOUS!  Worst movie I've seen in ages!

The movie tried really hard to put together a back story and a dark side to the main character...but failed on so many levels.  These four guys have one week to clear out all the asbestos from a 100,000 sq. ft. insane asylum, yet they just sit around all the time.  (Note to film writer:  at least make it someone believablea crew of 20 men couldn't have knocked that job out in two months).

The timeline is so tight, one worker just happens to find all the audio files, photos, and medical files on the one person in the entire history of the asylum that the story actually revolves around.  What are the odds, right?? Never mind that the place has been closed and vandalized since the mid '80s.  In 36 years nobody  messed with the files/films that were right there in the open.  But to make it even more comical (remember, they're on a 1-week deadline to basically boil the ocean), this guy finds the time to listen to 8 of the audio recordings and look through her medical records...all on company time.  The director went for some great cinematic shots but just failed miserably.  Like I said, there was NOTHING scary about this movie.

My daughter (who is 12) even commented that this movie was bad...it ended and she looked at me and said, ""Are you serious???  That's it???  [And I am now banned for one month from picking any movies for us].  She even commented that there were so many holes in the story.  The flashbacks were stupid, made little sense, added NOTHING to the story, and were so poorly presented that it was clear this was a low, low, REALLY low budget effort from a director that has no business trying to make a scary movie.

And the holes in this storyOMG!  My foot long club samwich with Swiss cheese has fewer holes!  The coins, the spilled hot water, the guy  working alongside the guy that stole his wifeWTF???  Who green lighted this POS??  I am now actually dumber after watching this movie.

All clowns giving this 4 stars...I can only guess you've never really seen a good movie.  There is NO WAY this movie deserves even two stars!

And to any of the actors (and I use that term loosely) that signed up for thisI really hope your home life situation gets betteryou must clearly be hurting for money.",1479427200,2,3052,4.438628158844765

1666486,5,B00005UQ9F,"Session 9 is a 2001 supernatural psychological thriller/horror film. For a relatively cheap price on Ebay, I was finally able to view Session 9 that had been on my watchlist for quite some time and I'm glad to say that this was a purchase I don't regret making.

5 guys; Gordon Fleming, his nephew Jeff, Mike King, Phil Cronenburg, and Hank Romero are part of the Hazmat Elimination Company. Collectively they are assigned to remove the decrepit, broken down remains and asbestos of the Danver's State Hospital that was shut down in 1985. Things start off fine and normal, but as in most cases with these situations, it's only a matter of time before creepy happenings begin taking place.

The further they lurk in the asylum, the more they uncover dark and horrifying secrets about the asylum's past that includes patient abuse, old school lobotomy procedures, rumors of demonic possession, and a set of strange audio recorded tape sessions that happen to be bizarrely connected with all the other secrets the asylum holds. As all 5 guys unlock the decades of evil, mystic secrets that lie within The Danvers State Hospital, they'll also uncover their own that will undoubtedly effect their state of mind, their trust, and maybe even their lives

Overall: I was overly impressed with Session 9. This film has been labeled as being disturbing, psychologically chilling, creepy, and mind boggling. After watching this it's hard to disagree with those comments. At many points in time, the movie is hard to figure out and truly grasp but it's not necessarily a bad thing as it kind of ties in with the plot. It's one of those horror movies that messes with your mind from the inside out to really get you thinking and along the way drops several subtle clues about the plot--many of which will fly right over your head the first time around. The opening 20-25 minutes of the movie start off kind of slow, but it's forgiven as it quickly starts to pick up going forward after that. There are some cringy, violent, bloody scenes here and there but won't delve into detail to save it for anyone who wants to watch this. The performances from everyone in this film is amazingly spectacular. Each character is completely different and unique with their own struggles. Overall, Session 9 is definitely one I recommend giving a watch. I recommend watching it in the dark though or late at night to really up the creepiness level it has to it. If you're tired of all the modern crapola found footage horror films with innocent, white, 17 year old female Julia in her white gown being possessed by demons, then refresh your taste with an original plot with a more mature and adult cast. Session 9 is a must-have for any fan of horror films",1442793600,3,2728,4.726890756302521

This amazing psychological horror film focuses on happenings through an asbestos abatement team's findings and feelings as they work and rummage through an abandoned mental asylum. The Danvers State Mental Hospital in Danvers, Massachusetts is the setting for the film. The team discovers a box marked ""Evidence"" and it contains 9 taped sessions with a patient. This is fascinating stuff and very eerie. It makes your skin crawl. It is interesting to see David Caruso in this film and he adds a great deal of authenticity and believability through his performance. This film was shot in HD digital video and gives it a feel of authenticity. I like this film because it creates a very real sense of uneasiness through the darkness and uncertainty of implied events.

Just as in Steel Magnolias, this movie centers around a work space, only instead of a hair salon, it's this massive old building, an abandoned state hospital that treated the insane, where a crew of five asbestos abatement workers have come to abate the asbestos, which I didn't even know was a thing people specialized in, but when one of the characters explains to his less seasoned colleague how over time the fibers in your lung build up like pearls that are actually time bombs whose explosion will eventually flood all the tubes and tubules of your lungs and leave you drowning from within, I had to admit it was a brilliant choice as an element for a horror movie.

And just a men are basically physically absent throughout most of Steel Magnolias (I haven't seen the movie, but I did watch the play) so are women here, appearing only in fleeting glimpses, or as the subject of jealous rivalries, sources of guilt and, in one crucial case, a voice on audiotape.

The biggest strength in this film is the way that it is able to draw emotionally convincing portraits of an ensemble of characters. Each of the five asbestos workers has his own motivation, his own burden of problems, his own weaknesses and his own wounds, and all of them feed into the building tension that threatens to tear the group apart as things slowly begin to go south.

Especially distinctive among movies about scary abandoned places, Session 9 mostly takes place during the day, sunlight streaming into the great ruined chamber that was once a solarium, or making intense penumbrae around the edges of boarded up windows. I read somewhere that the screenplay was basically written in order to be able to shoot in the incredible location, on the outside a huge brick castle, on the inside a fascinating picture of decay made all the creepier by the filmmakers who supply us with patient rooms whose walls are paste-caked with newspaper images of death and deformity, and a hollowed out space in the walls containing old coins, gold teeth and a tiny pouch filled with prosthetic eyes of glass.

This is the best sort of independent horror movie, and it really didn't surprised me when I saw Larry Fessenden make a cameo appearanceI don't know that I've ever seen this great promoter of creative talent within the horror industry appear in a bad film (check the comments for a short list of some of my favorite films Fessenden appears in). While it may not be as ground breaking as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is every bit as much a fully realized piece and while it's quite low key and no gore fest, it succeeds at taking you to scary places and showing you blood curdling sights.",1431388800,10,2894,4.64453125

All of them are under pressure to complete a job in a very short amount of time. And yet, one hangs out in the basement for hours listening to tapes. Another digs in the walls and is rarely seen except at lunch. They all spend hours outside on the longest lunch breaks imaginable and all leave for home well before dark. You end up wondering why they all didn't just wander away and find better, more interesting jobs. For a movie to work, the story must make sense at least within its perspective. This movie doesn't make sense from any perspective. The only thing supporting the ""surprise ending"" is that nothing in the movie makes the ending impossible.",1419638400,3,1008,4.765714285714286

1666544,4,B00005UQ9F,"After three viewings (spaced a few years apart), I still find this film to be deeply chilling.  It has no gore, almost no onscreen violence and hardly any blood.  It's strictly a character-driven, psychological horror story, but boy is it disturbing.

The location, the decrepit remains of Massachusetts' Danvers State Mental Hospital (which I believe was the inspiration for H.P. Lovecraft's Arkham Institute) is well utilized to maximum creepy effect in this story about a team of five asbestos abatement contractors who fall victim to an evil entity that one of them inadvertently unleashes from a box marked ""EVIDENCE.""  This evidence takes the form of a series of reel-to-reel tapes documenting nine therapy sessions of a criminally insane patient with multiple personality disorder, portions of which are played throughout the film.  How the evil infects the men and which one is impacted the most profoundly is at the heart of the film's mystery and it kept me guessing right up until the end.

The cast of mostly well-known actors, including Peter Mullan (best known for Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows), David Caruso and Josh Lucas, deliver very natural performances as a group of blue-collar guys who secretly believe they're just biding their time until something better comes along.  I was particularly charmed by The Killing's Brendan Sexton III, as the youngest member of the team, who's sweet and a bit simple.  They all seemed like people you'd meet in the real world and not Hollywood types posing as working class characters.

As a horror film, this may not be for everyone.  It's really quite subtle in comparison to the current trend of torture-porn flicks (e.g., Hostel, Saw).  But for me, I find it very upsetting and creepy.  So much so that the ending actually kept me up at night.",1412553600,3,1808,4.99

Session 9 (2001) is a psychological thriller/semi horror movie that stars David Caruso.  I found this movie to be somewhat boring, but had some decent moments.  This is one of those modern movies that tries to be hip and cool, with the characters constantly swearing, etc.  For me, this has a negative effect, as it made me not care about the characters at all.  I didn't care what happened to them throughout the movie, as their behavior robbed me of any concern I might have for them.  This movie's atmosphere is somewhat creepy at times, but not anywhere near the creepiness of countless other far superior movies that fall into the psychological thriller category.

1666587,3,B00005UQ9F,"So what do I really think of Session 9?  My review title isn't entirely honest just as Session 9 isn't entirely honest.  Perhaps my inner contrarian feels betrayed by all the glowing reviews here at amazon .  I thought this would be a truly disturbing horror film.  It turns out it was practically neither.  Session 9 is pretty much just a psychological drama with a violent ending, just as Silence of the Lamb and Se7en are not really horror films.  Unlike those two films, Session 9 wasn't nearly as scary, violent, disturbing, well acted, or made.  That said; this film is not a major Hollywood production and I tend to give low budget films a break.  However, Session 9 failed in ways many low budget films do not.  Lets clear the dust on this.

-STORY, STORY, STORY
One aspect of film making that does not require a big budget is creative story telling.  Session 9 has a fairly disconnected story with facets that generate mood but don't really move the story along.  In fact, the titular sessions (Clinical recordings of a murderer with multiple personalities) are pretty much unnecessary to the films ultimate ending though they are probably the scariest part of the film.  The basic premise around which the story revolves is a small crew of asbestos removal technicians who are assigned the task of cleaning up the hazardous material from a large facility in a ridiculously short amount of time. The guys spend a lot of time cleaning, joking, eating lunch, arguing, and wasting time snooping around.  Strangely, the boss says they're making great progress (really?).  The story does have twist and turns (not particularly challenging ones) and a key figure that comes from nowhere.  Yet, I eventually gave up guessing who would turn the story towards mayhem since there were only a couple of options.  The red hairing was not particularly effective since the prime suspect quickly became obvious.

-DONT BREATHE THE ATMOSPHERE
As you may have already read, this film takes place in Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusetts; the true star of this film.  The best parts of the story are the moments of historical recollection concerning this building.  The true goings-on at Danvers were horrific and disturbing especially since they are true. The building, tight schedule, life threatening hazardous material, and friction among the crew all create a foreboding atmosphere.  This may well be the most effective part of the film.  Unfortunately its not enough to satisfy my need for a more challenging story.

-DEFINE HORROR
So what constitutes a horror film?  Like Se7en and Silence of the Lamb, Session 9 could be labeled a psychological thriller or drama.  Im not going to argue what it is, but little happens in the first hour of the film to warrant the Horror tag.  I guess a film of this nature becomes horror when some audacious gore or violence occurs.  There is a sense of dread that hangs over the film due to the interpersonal tensions and the hazards of the job.  However, the violence comes way too late to ratchet up the requisite suspense or thrills I personally look forward to in horror films.  That said I have to view this as a low budget psychological drama with a violent end.  That doesnt make this an inherently bad film; it just means I think marketing this film as a horror film is a bit disingenuous.

-SAY SOMETHING SORT OF NICE
  A lot of people liked this film.  So I feel compelled to acknowledge the things this film did right.  Though many elements of the story were superfluous to the plot, the plot was actually pretty compelling.  I might have enjoyed this more as a short film (40 minutes or less).  As it is, I found the film to feel so padded with distractions and un-needed details that the plot became diluted.
  The Acting was mostly well executed.  After Danvers, Peter Mullen and David Caruso were the clear human stars of this film.  They did a good job of developing the air of uneasy doubt that dominates this film.  I really can't stand David Caruso, but he did a reasonable job as a slightly suspicious foremen.  The other actors did nothing to harm this film, were often entertaining, and served well as eventual victims.
The overall production values of this film were, at worst, adequate.  Considering that nearly the entire film was shot on the grounds of Danvers the creepy feel of the film was a given.  The cinematography was effective though usually unremarkable at telling the story and keeping the dark mood.

-WHATS THE FINAL CALL?
I have issues with Session 9 being hyped as a terrifying horror film when its more of a slow paced psychological drama.  Its not a bad psychological drama, but Ive seen better.  There are acts of grotesque violence and brutal killings (of which very little is seen).  Unfortunately most of these obscured acts happen in the last 15 minutes of the film.  The film has an uneasy atmosphere and lots of tension to go along with the meager violence.  Yet the execution of the plot is overlong and full of distractions that do little to move it along and prove to be nothing more than interesting distractions.  Rental is probably the way to go if you're curious.  If you don't expect a terrifying horror film, you just might enjoy it.

Gordon gets possessed by 'simon' when he is out inspecting the hospital (you can hear the voice in his head when he's near that crazy b's room and the creepy chair). He goes home after winning the bid, murders his wife and baby, doesn't remember it (because 'simon' was the one who did it), and the rest of the movie follows his descent into madness ie revelation of his actions. That is why in the session 9 tape at the end you hear the doctor talking to 'simon' (this is when everything is starting to go super crazy at the end), he says he takes refuge in the 'weak and the wounded' or something (remember that Gordon was under tons of stress from the new baby and trying to find work). Anyways, that's why he was hanging out in that crazy ladies old room putting up pictures of his family and friends, because they were both possessed by the same entity.

1666607,5,B00005UQ9F,"The film, for any who have not seen it, stands apart from the majority of horror films today, and indeed in the past as well. It is true psychological horror, and relies more on atmosphere and suggestion than on cheap theatrics and in-your-face gore. The narrative builds a little bit slowly, but that is often the case for the genre, and when the film reaches its climax, it is worth the wait. The film will haunt you for days after it ends. If you prefer slashers, this probably isn't the film for you, but if you enjoy artful thrillers and horror that engages your mind as well as your senses, Session 9 is definitely a worthwhile purchase.",1360195200,5,643,4.504273504273504
1666608,3,B00005UQ9F,"I found this quite highly recommended little horror watchable, but the ending somehow disappointed me. Below some more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.

The good initial idea was to make a film about hard working blue collar people who make their living by removing asbestos from old buildings. This is a hard, dirty and dangerous work and they certainly deserve every penny they are paid for doing it. Their small team is made of five men: Gordon (the owner of the company and therefore the boss), Jeff (Gordon's young nephew, a rookie on his first job), Mike (a law school dropout), Hank (physically very strong and also kind of an a--hole) and finally Phil (Gordon's old pal, pretty depressed those last months). Other than David Caruso (who plays Phil) and Paul Guilfoyle (""CSI""), who makes a cameo in the beginning, I didn't know any actors, but they did as good a job, as the scenario alowed them.

Gordon's company just won the bid for a big job - cleaning a very large, old and a little sinister building, which for many years served as a psychiatric hospital. I will say no more about the plot. The place they clean is indeed quite fascinating and really CREEPY, offering a lot of possibilities, but of which only some were used by the director. Which is a pity.

During more than two-thirds of the film not much really happens, but surprisingly, this very long and slow 70 minutes were, at least for my personal taste, the best part of the film. Conversations between the five main characters, vision of this abandoned place where so much human misery poured into the walls and some little warnings, that something bad could possibly happen later - all that was quite watchable, and I would rate ""Session 9"" four stars, if the whole film could be like that.

Sadly, the last 20 minutes, I didn't like much. OK, I must concede that the BIG TWIST was unexpected, but once I recovered from it, I didn't enjoy the final parts of the film too much. But, to be honest, this is only my personal, subjective impression. From what I read in other reviews, many people rather liked the ending.

Bottom line, this is a honest little horror/thriller, quite watchable, with a rather surprising ending, which viewers might like - or not. Maybe the best thing is to watch it and make up your own mind.",1359936000,2,2309,4.635696821515892

It was like some sort of collage... bits and pieces just thrown together... but with nothing else tying them to each other.

The acting was great, good actors and interesting characters. I'm not going to spoil the story but I will say that it's basic, it starts off slow and picks up towards the ending, the ending was good but a little bit confusing. There was only 1 soundtrack that played off and on during the whole movie, it was good and creepy, and I applaud the sound effects.

1. Some great interior and exterior shots of the Danvers State Hospital, a remarkable (and remarkably creepy) piece of architecture which unfortunately no longer exists.
2. The session tapes themselves, within the film, were some of the creepiest things I've heard in years. Really, really well-done scripting and voice-acting on those.

Other than that, the movie is really nothing to rave about in my opinion. While it's not terrible, it's certainly not great either. Nothing really terrified me in this movie, and I often had the feeling that given the setting, I should have been a bit more creeped out than I was. The characters are not that well drawn out, the script gets a little tedious at times, and the ending is a bit underwhelming as well. I've heard comparisons between this movie and The Shining, and while I can see the parallels in terms of the setting (large, empty, creepy building) and even in other elements of the movie, The Shining remains leagues above Session 9 in my opinion.

1666621,5,B00005UQ9F,"SESSION 9

This is perhaps one of the greatest overlooked gems of horror ever produced, if not all time, then certainly in the last 10 years.  It is a cleverly constructed story which seems simple enough on the surface, but as the film goes on, we end up with more and more questions than we do answers.  It is well written and acted, but the thing that really stands out about this movie is its location and subtle action.

Session 9 plays out like a desert island scenario--5 guys who work in asbestos removal are hired to undertake the herculean task of cleaning up the abandoned State Mental Asylum in Danvers, Massachusetts in just one week.  The story therefore centers on this determined crew who are isolated away from society in the caverns and broken hallways of the gigantic hospital.  Each individual has a very distinct personality and set of goals, ranging from empty-headed teenager, compulsive gambler, focused employee, future lawyer, and the owner who pulls it all together.  They work well as a team, especially since there is a huge bonus waiting for them if they meet the deadline, but there are also cracks forming at the seams.  Tensions gradually build as personal conflicts surface on the job site, tensions made all the worse by the strange location this team seems trapped in, caged themselves as it were by some mystic force.

This is perhaps the greatest point in Session 9--the location.  The film was in fact shot in the old Danvers State hospital, and it's no creative inspiration when the film states that Danvers is where the pre-frontal lobotomy was perfected.  So it's not just the physical dilapidation that is so jarring to the eye, but also a psychic depravity that seems to keep a hold on the place.  In a way, it shares this quality with the Shining, a spot of ground so contaminated by horrible deeds and suffering that it seems to have permeated the walls.  A better place to film could not have been chosen and just like the Shining, the hospital becomes the star attraction.  If any place is haunted, if demons really exists, then they must dwell here.

That's sort of where the film leaves off, too.  The story just unfolds with very little action actually taking place.  Instead, Brad Anderson (director) keeps feeding facts into the movie that gradually increase the tension and suspense.  Central to this is the discovery by one of the crew of an old set of audio reels, recordings of hypnosis sessions from a patient suffering from split personality disorder.  Why of all the reels he is drawn to this particular one is for the viewer to decide, but the voices on the tape quickly parallel the events taking place.  Then things get strange.  One of the crew disappears.  Threats are made.  The hypnosis sessions become more intense.  Things best left buried are coming to the surface.  All the bones of the tormented souls of Danvers seem to be rising up, as are the skeletons of the crew working there.

The film does a great job in creating a situation where all is not what it may seem.  It's a strong point of the film that some people may not like because it avoids establishing definite conclusions.  The viewer's perceptions are frequently questioned--are we sure we just saw that?  Is there a reasonable explanation, or is this a supernatural situation?  Even as the truth begins to unfold towards the end, we are still left with lots of room to interpret.

I also like that fact that most of the film contains no violence at all.  The unsettling aspects of the movie are all psychological.  It borrows a lot from Val Lewton's concept that you can create more scare by showing less, and it's a facet of the film that works.  There is also a lack of spooks and ghouls popping out, or of startling noises.  The film doesn't pander to the use of cheap effects to get a thrill out of the audience but relies on good pacing and intelligent dialog.
Something too, that a lot of people may overlook is a strong reliance instead on sound in this movie.  The background music is haunting, drips from the ceiling echo down empty halls, insects chatter outside.  The voices on the audio reels murmur in such a way as to send chills down your spine.  It's a device often overlooked in films and one that deserves the proper acknowledgement when used well.

Session 9 is a great psychological horror movie that gets its scares and leaves the viewer unable to conclude what is real or not.  Like the hospital it was filmed in, it is embedded with sadness and tragedy.  The characters are all likable and you get to know them as intimately as such a short time will allow.  The symbolism is great and not too over the top, but just enough to add an extra element to the plot.  It's a little known movie, but one that deserves great attention.",1332979200,6,4785,4.6263345195729535

Few films have such an intense sense of place as is evoked by the Danvers Mental Institution that serves as the film's backdrop. The story is very simple: a group of contractors agree to remove hazardous materials from the condemned institution and spend a week within its walls. While there, paranoia and insanity begin to spread through the group, and a truly terrifying story of evil unfolds. Peter Mullan is amazing in the lead, setting the mold for the guilt-ridden protagonist that Brad Anderson will return to explore in THE MACHINIST, SOUNDS LIKE, and TRANSSIBERIAN.

Hardcore fans will find the film slow and accuse it of lacking payoff, particularly younger viewers or those with short attention spans. But discerning viewers will find so much to like about this movie, and find that the voice of ""Simon"" will become one of the most haunting and memorable things they've experienced in a horror film.

1666669,5,B00005UQ9F,"Written by Brad Anderson & Stephen Gevedon; Directed by Brad Anderson (ASIN: B00005UQ9F)

The best rule for a horror story is ""Don't show the monster."" Alfred Hitchcock knew it. Robert Wise (The Haunting, 1963) knew it. Director Brad Anderson has mastered it. Much like the original version of The Haunting, Session 9 also takes advantage of another great rule in horror: ""Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere."" The camera drifts around corners and into the harsh shadows of Danvers State Mental Hospital, a real hospital and portrayed in its genuinely rundown condition.

Gordon Fleming, played eerily spot-on by Scottish actor Peter Mullan, leads the team of Hazmat Elimination Co. into the vacant corpse of a once prominent mental institution famous for its invention of the pre-frontal lobotomy. Their job is filthy, dangerous and stressful--to strip all the carcinogenic asbestos insulation from the building before its imminent refurbishing one week later. David Caruso, Stephen Gevedon, Josh Lucas, and Brendan Sexton III round out the cast as the rest of the elimination team, each hinting at the shortcomings that have landed them in this hellish job. The promise of a $10,000 bonus hanging just beyond reach, they set out to clean the facility.
But Danvers State also holds its own attractions. For Mike (Stephen Gevedon,) it is the taped sessions with a psychotic patient named Mary Hobbes. For Hank (Josh Lucas,) it is the stash of old coins and trinkets he discovers hidden in the walls. For Phil (David Caruso,) it is perhaps the ultimate ownership of Hazmat Elimination Co. And for Gordon, it is something far more unsettling and not altogether natural.
Perhaps the most imposing character in the film is Danvers State Mental Hospital itself. Shaped like a bat, with a once administrative area branching off into ""wings,"" the farthest reaches of this enormous creature were reserved for the most severely psychotic cases...cases like Mary Hobbes.
An effective use of foreshadowing, steady rise in tension, masterful cinematography and a group of solid character-actors makes Session 9 the best film to grace an otherwise flagging genre since, well, The Haunting.
The DVD (from USA Home Entertainment) contains the 100-minute feature film in letterbox, Deleted Scenes (including a wisely rethought alternate ending,) Story-to-Screen storyboard comparisons, Director's Commentary (with blessed on/off feature,) a chilling theatrical trailer, and the fascinating featurette, ""The Haunted Palace,"" a look at the very real location and some of the art inspired by it.

1666670,5,B00005UQ9F,"Update June 30, 2011-

I was absolutely WRONG to dismiss Session 9.  For some really bizarre reason, in my original review I criticized Session 9 for not delivering with any terrifying fears (such as revealing ghosts and demons and whatnot in grand, dramatic style).  Well... my approach in watching Session 9 must have been completely messed up, and I definitely STRONGLY realize the error of my ways now.

I realize I wasn't attempting to get into this movie properly from the get go, and had my own assumptions how the storyline SHOULD have been done, when in reality Session 9 is an intelligently written horror film right from the beginning.  I shouldn't have been so quick to judge it, because doing so unfortunately enabled me to judge it unfairly.

In my original review I mention that the film had potential and ""wasn't utilized properly or fully""... well, that was obviously a sign that, the night I watched it, I didn't have the appropriate attention span required in order to grasp the complexity of the way the plot develops.  Watching Session 9 again this afternoon, I realize it's an extremely well-written storyline.  The suspense *is* there after all, but if you don't take the time to carefully pay attention to the storyline and character development, you will miss over important portions of the movie that will undoubtedly end up leading to an unsatisfying experience overall.  I'm honestly kicking myself for misunderstooding the film as much as I did.  I mean, I was *really* off in my original review, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.

I originally complained that it took entirely too long for the ""everyone loses their minds"" aspect of the storyline to kick in, but the truth is, that aspect was definitely there from the beginning, and increases gradually until everyone eventually can't take the pressure and inner torment anymore.

So to sum up my updated and more accurate review- Session 9 *does* contain atmosphere, a perfect horror setting, and a well-written and highly creative storyline.  Perhaps watching it twice is exactly what I should have done in the first place, but you must understand, I've never had a movie increase in quality as drastically as this one simply by watching it twice.  This particular experience is all new to me.

I've noticed since I wrote my review last November, several more low ratings from recent reviews have been submitted to amazon.  Well, to me that means people need to watch Session 9 again.  Don't just assume it's a slow-moving storyline like I once did, and really take the time to pay exceptionally close attention to the characters.  Also, I believe Session 9 is a perfect movie for those who admire the Shining, the 80's horror classic.  Session 9 feels like it was based off that movie, so if you like the Shining, you simply MUST watch Session 9.

Anyway, here's my original review, which is honestly completely wrong, but I'll leave it here so you read through a reviewers misguided first impression. Here it is-

Session 9 isn't necessarily a *pitiful* attempt at a horror film.  More like, it had potential that wasn't utilized properly or fully.

The biggest number one problem is that for 75% of the film you're basically being teased into believing a dramatic terrorizing experience is going to be right around the corner and yet... it never happens.  At least, not how you'd expect.

The storyline is about a group of workers assigned on a quick deadline job to fix up an abandoned hospital where the mentally sick used to stay.

Now what's interesting (and I actually give the writers a little bit of credit for this) is that you're never sure just WHERE the storyline is going.  This can be a problem obviously because it's slightly confusing to follow, but it can also keep the viewers guessing.

Maybe I shouldn't speak for everyone, but I know *I* was definitely guessing just exactly how the horror would eventually be shown.  I was convinced some kind of ghostly spirit would come out of the walls or hallways and kill the workers one by one, but actually it was more like the abandoned hospital made the workers slowly but surely lose their minds.

Unfortunately it took *such* a long time for this crucial element of the storyline to take effect (at least an hour and 10 minutes of waiting) that I end up feeling cheated in the actual scares and disappointed in the overall film.

However if you've managed to stick with it for the first 45 minutes, you mine as well watch it till its conclusion.  At least the ending is a minor surprise.  It's not the biggest surprise in the history of horror, but I didn't see it coming so I'm glad I didn't turn it off.  This film desperately needed some atmosphere for me to recommend it though.  A regular day on the job with young men talking normally to each other isn't exactly the right environment for uncontrollable fear.",1290384000,2,4865,4.76491646778043
1666671,4,B00005UQ9F,"Gordon [Stephen Gevedon] is badly in need of money and sleep; he has a new baby at home, and the constant crying along with financial difficulties is putting a strain on his relationship with his wife, Wendy. When the opportunity to clean up an abandoned asylum comes up, Gordon offers to do the job in just two weeks, though his partner, Phil [David Caruso] thinks this improbable. The only way to get the job done is to hire a crew of three rather questionable workers. There's Hank, with a drug problem and addiction to gambling; Mike, a would-be lawyer who is wandering through life, and Jeff, the inexperienced young nephew of Gordon.

Immediately, each one reacts to a presence in the eerie asylum. Hank is drawn to the morgue, where he find a treasure--the gold and silver belongings of the patients in the incinerator, suggesting that Nazi-like experiments were going on here. Gordon is hearing voices, telling him ""to do it."" Mike is obsessed with the patient records, and one patient in particular, ""Mary,"" who suffers from multiple personality disorder. He listens to the tapes of her sessions, voices changing as each personality makes itself known. Only Jeff and Phil seem able to keep the place at bay.

Session 9 is a haunting exploration of the demons that everyone holds inside them, and the treatment of the mental ill. Illness and demonic possession blur each man is taken over by his obsessions and by the demons that walk the halls of the asylum.",1288396800,4,1467,4.794466403162056
1666672,4,B00005UQ9F,"I agree with another reviewer about the difference between horror movie lovers. Either: a) You love gore and shock cinema or; b) You like atmosphere. Similar to many slow-burning movies, especially 70s films like Changeling, Session 9 is all about foreplay. The characters become familiar, the building becomes familiar, and you find yourself completely engrossed in the film. Although the script could have used some slight tweaking (such as some odd dialog by one of the main actors as he practically relays an historian's account of a former patient's life history), the characters are still well developed. All-in-all this is a good ""atmospheric"" horror film that will leave you with a creepy sense of dread long after the credits have finished rolling.",1287705600,3,757,5.213114754098361
1666673,2,B00005UQ9F,"It starts off bad from the start. We are introduced to a bunch of characters, but it feels as though the movie left out the part where we were actually introduced to them. They are talking about and referring to things that the audience has no clue about, yet the film acts as though we are supposed to. The point is that we are supposed to piece things together and at the end of the story, a dark secret will be revealed, but it really isn't an effective way to start off a movie. I don't want to be confused from the get go, especially in a mindless horror film.
should you choose to watch it against my advice, Session 9 is a character movie, just without character.

In terms of horror, Session 9 has very little. Most of the movie takes place during the day, and the climax even takes place in daylight. The creepiest part of the movie, where one of the workers is pursued down a pitch black corridor by someone or something, only lasts for a minute. There isn't anything even remotely exciting in the whole film.

he only interesting part of Session 9 is the small storyline where one of the workers listens to a bunch of old tapes of a psychologist interviewing a woman who has multiple personalities, one of which is a killer. Listening to the tapes was truly creepy, and also grabbed my attention. Strangely enough, these tapes are where the movie gets its title from (""Session 9"" is the interview number with the patient), but the story the tapes tell never gets incorporated into the movie. I see where the screenwriter was trying to go with it, but I didn't see much of a connection.

By the end of the movie, I had already made up my mind. Session 9 is an utterly bad movie without much going for it. I have to admit that I was impressed by the little twist at the end, but by that point, the movie had lost.

Forget any inklings or references to 'The Shining', as this film takes place in the most notoriously haunted & scariest places in the world: Danvers State Hospital. Having seen this hospital myself in 2003, I can attest without question that this property leaves an impression which will stay with you a lifetime. Anderson masterfully presents a complex scenario of pshycho-terror that one would expect from Danvers. The storyline is straightforward: an asbestos removal company is awarded the bid to clean up various areas of the derelict hospital; but as the week progresses there is very strange happenings with Gordon (Peter Mullen), the asbestos company owner. The casting is perfect, with Peter Mullen becoming 'possessed' by ""Simon"", one of the  schizophrenic personalities of former patient Mary Hobbs. David Caruso performs brilliantly as the job foreman & his growing conflict with Mullen is surely one of the highlights of the film. The story touches on many areas of interest, including solitude, lonliness & the dichotomy of good & evil.

1666678,5,B00005UQ9F,"Few films are capable of producing an atmosphere that is truly haunting in its own regards, despite any of the onscreen action that may be occurring.  Well, Session 9 is one of those films.  The overall filming environment simply reeks of an eerie, haunting tone, setting up the feelings for the forthcoming events that are bound to unfold.  The film takes place in an abandoned Psychiatric Hospital, Danvers State Mental Hospital in Danvers, Massachusetts.

The hospital has been abandoned for several years, closing in 1985, but the owners suddenly decide it's time to clean the building up after all these years.  They begin by hiring an asbestos removal crew.  Enter Gordon Fleming and his team known as The Hazmat Elimination Company.  Gordon and his teammate Phil are given a tour of the abandoned hospital, in order to secure a bid for the removal job.  Upon receiving the tour, the audience is greeted with disturbing environments at every turn.  From dark corridors, to abandoned lobotomy  tables along with other surgical and mental tools, the entire hospital radiates with a supernatural feeling.

The feeling grows as the tour is almost completed, with Gordon and Phil being shown the floor in which the hospital kept its most dangerous inhabitants.  At the end of the hallway on this floor, the two see a small wheelchair laying in the darkness at the end of the hall.  However, getting to the end of the hall may be more difficult than it seems, seeing as Gordon is told that the floor is weak in this hallway due to water damage.  Mesmerized by the wheelchair, Gordon is greeted by a voice with a haunting tone saying ""Hello, Gordon"".

Gordon puts a bid in with the owner that they can complete the project in a week, despite the fact that Phil states it's a two week job, stating that he desperately needs the cash since he recently became a father, and then gathers his team for the first day of work.  Things start off slow enough, with the team members simply enjoying themselves and taking the job slowly.  However, as the days progress, things become a little disturbing, and it seems like all of the workers are slowly losing their sanity.

Mike (one of Gordon's crew members) becomes obsessed with a series of audio files he found which contain mental evaluation sessions that the doctors performed on a woman named Mary Hobbes.  Each night, Mike listens to several of these sessions.  Each session slowly reveals more and more about Mary and her alternate personalities, however it also appears as if the events within the film are also determined by the number of sessions that Mike has listened to.  After each session is played more disturbing events begin to occur at the hospital.

By the time Mike reaches session 9, the final session given to Mary, it is obvious that all of the workers have lost their minds.  With their actions becoming more disturbing with each passing day, until the dramatic build up at the end, the film keeps the audience on their toes, slowly watching in anticipation of the next haunting occurrence.  The evil entity that existed within Mary all those years ago has found a new host.

The overall presentation of the film is extremely well done.  The acting is spot on for delivering a believable, spine-shivering viewing experience.  The pacing is perfect and does a fantastic job at showing the slow transformations that each asbestos removal worker is experiencing with each passing day without feeling too drawn out.  The ambiance and entire atmosphere of the film simply radiates of supernatural and haunting tones. The hospital environment alone is capable of producing spine shivering chills, but the ending is chilling and twisted, revealing the true evil that resided within the hospital all these years, just waiting for a spirit weak enough that it could control.  An overall amazing film from start to finish, one that should not be overlooked if you're a fan of horror and psychological thriller movies like ""The Shinning"".",1278374400,3,3993,4.882789317507418

1666690,4,B00005UQ9F,"""Session 9"" is a highly atmospheric, chilling horror movie which evokes credible suspense by the fact that it is shot on location at what was once known as the Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts, which was used since the 1860s as an asylum for the insane. The building itself is imposing as viewers get to see it when two of the main characters drive up to it - an imposing, red-bricked Victorian-era structure which almost seems to be glowering at viewers - truly a chilling spectacle.

The story centers around a small group of asbestos abatement workers, including Peter Mullan as Gordon, the owner of the business and David Caruso as Phil the supervisor. Then there's Josh Lucas playing Hank, a lazy and irresponsible worker, and a few other secondary characters. Well, Peter gets the job of cleaning out the institution of asbestos by guaranteeing that his crew will get the job done in a week, which almost seems a Herculean task given how huge the building is.

The scare factor in this movie is quite high, and even my husband (who is NOT a horror fan) expressed how creepy he felt as he watched it with me. Viewers get a foreshadowing of what is to come when Gordon, who seems emotionally troubled throughout the movie, `hears' a voice calling his name as he spies an abandoned wheelchair in the dreary darkness of the institution. Another worker gets obsessed with listening to old recordings of `sessions' with patients, particularly a patient named Mary who had apparently suffered from multiple personality disorders. A slow sensation of dread creeps up one's spine listening to Mary's disembodied voice take on different personalities, even a man's as she engages with her interviewer during these sessions - there's three alternate personalities, i.e. the Princess, Peter and Simon, and as the viewer listens in on these sessions (there are nine of them in all), one cannot help but feel these sessions are key to unlocking the mysterious goings-on at the asylum.

The movie takes its time developing the plot - director Brad Anderson keeps the suspense going though and there is no resorting to gratuitous violence or gore here, every scene is carefully engineered to elicit dread and scares. Yes, the movie did remind me of the classic horror movie, ""The Shining"", yet I also felt it was original in its story and execution.

1666697,5,B00005UQ9F,"Nowadays, there are so few real, quality horror films that get enough recognition. Sure, there are a good deal of great films that are under the radar of the mainstream, but when a really good horror movie of recent times comes around, it's definitely worth notice. And ""Session 9"" is worth the notice!

Taking influence largely from ""The Shining"", in my opinion, ""Session 9"" is a psychological horror film with a great deal of intense and mysterious atmosphere that's laid on thicker than Thanksgiving gravy. The powerful sense of dread and chilling mystery presented throughout the film is simply enticing and definitely makes you want to see the whole thing. In addition to the asylum, which is one of the big reasons why the film is so great, this film delves pretty deeply into psychology with the recorded sessions of the asylum patients. This part definitely sucked me in, because psychology has always been a topic of great curiosity to me.

Running at 1 hour and 40 minutes, this movie is longer than most slashers and about as long as more psychological films. However, the length of the film doesn't drag it down or make it boring, because the movie is able to fill all 100 minutes with interest and mystery. Honestly, the asylum is one of the greatest locations I've seen in a while in horror films. The written part is also done excellently, showcasing a strong plot and chilling series of events. In addition, the acting is great, with the actors showing how truly talented they are, regardless of how much mainstream attention they get.

Overall, with a dark and bleak feeling throughout, and a bitter ending, this is not a fun film by any means. However, ""Session 9"" is a film that will suck you into its mystery, depth, darkness and bleak appeal. If the feeling of this movie is too strong, I recommend washing it off with another great, modern-day horror film such as ""Planet Terror"" (even if it isn't 100% horror, it's great nonetheless). But as for this film, well, ""Session 9"" is the psychological horror film to beat of modern movies! Highly recommended for those interested in such a film, and to close, just because I love the quote so much, I need to say it again.

1666698,4,B00005UQ9F,"The atmosphere in this film is just brilliant. The setting puts you on edge to begin with since it takes place in an abandoned mental hospital, but even deserted there's just something about the building that doesn't seem right. It's like something has infected the structure down to its core. The setting seems to rely heavily on luminescence or the lack thereof. Even when a room in the hospital is illuminated, it still feels dark. Darkness still overwhelms it like it's hiding something. In addition to that, there's the Mary Hobbes subplot that makes the film that much more disturbing. But the less you know about that going into the film, the better.

While the film has a fantastic atmosphere, it seems to be lacking something to make it a superb film. Everything seems to be there as the script is good, the writing is top notch, can't complain about the acting, there's a bit of a twist in the ending that's really well done, and the film stays with you long after you watch it. The best explanation is that it had all the elements of a superb film, but it dropped the ball slightly in its execution. The pieces of the puzzle weren't put together in exactly the right way, but were put together in a way that still resulted in a good psychological horror film.

Session 9 is the perfect horror film for people who like films that mess with their head. It gets beneath your skin and stays there. While the film is practically a cult classic and contains all the elements of a great horror film, it seems to be lacking something.

I found this movie by accident late in 2008 never having heard of it before.
I admit that I didn't know what the heck was going on during the greater part of it. The movie tends to go off in enough different directions that I found myself wondering, who is the bad guy here? Why is this 'thing' happening? What was that scene all about? Um...Huh!?
And even at the end, when I learned, 'Who Dunnit', I didn't know why exactly. I was still confused but I was extremely creeped out by the movie. It did what I like movies to do. It made me think for days afterward.
I was thinking so much about it that I finally watched it again & then still went to Wikipedia & read an interview with Caruso & Anderson before I finally ""got it!""

If I have any complaints its with the youngest actor ( the nephew ) in the movie as he seemed a bit amaturish. I believe I could have played the part just as well & Im alot amaturish! But this is after all a low budget movie...

Overall, this was a very interesting & fun film to watch from the opening scene with the 'chair' to the credits.

1666725,4,B00005UQ9F,"""Session 9"" is a complex and very tense horror movie annex psychological drama, that will still haunt you long after it has finished, at least that's what it did to me. The story plays itself out on multiple levels and can be interpreted in as many ways, making it interesting material to discuss subjects ranging from MPS to possession.
""Session 9"" is that kind of movie that slowly crawls under your skin and increasingly gives you a feeling of unease and tension, that most horror movies today unfortunately are unable to instill. It is a subtle human drama, aided by fantastic performances by David Caruso and even more so Peter Mullan.
The latter is in charge of a clean-up crew that has to remove asbestos in a gigantic former psychiatric institution as part of preparations for a renovation. Peter Mullan's character Gordon really needs this job financially and was only able to beat competition in the bid for it by promising the contractor to do it in half the time, a week. Even for a team this experienced, excluding Gordon's nephew Jeff who is new in the business of asbestos removal, it makes it a quite stressful job, but at the end a bonus awaits them if they make it on time and so all of them agree to do it. All of them means, aside from Gordon and Jeff, Phil (David Caruso) who manages the team, Hank, an annoying guy who has a problem with Phil since hitting it off with Phil's former girlfriend which he never fails to point out to Phil and finally Mike, who gave up his law studies in college but is considering going back to it.
Gordon recently had a baby and is suffering a lot from the stress and exhaustion that comes with it, which is a concern to the others of the team, especially as business wasn't exactly booming before this job.
On day 1 both Mike and Hank make a find: the former a number of tapes with recordings of therapy sessions with someone called Mary suffering from MPS (Multiple Personality Syndrome) whose case he becomes obsessed with and the latter a collection of old coins which he decides to pick up at night to start a new life somewhere (which includes attending casino school in Vegas). It will be his last visit on the premises. After that night to the others Hank simply bailed and pressure on Gordon is even more increased to get the job done in time and he increasingly becomes convinced that his team is distrustful of his ability to pull it off. He has cause to think this as Phil tries to take over the reigns as he feels compelled to as a response to Gordon's increasing mental instability.
As an audience we regularly go back to a scene where Gordon sits in his car in front of his house waiting to go in as it is raining and he watches his baby cry, It's a flashback to the day he got the job and he is about to tell his wife the good news accompanied by groceries and flowers. We watch him go in and as the camera focuses on a pan with boiling water that accidentally is being poured on Gordon's leg by his wife we hear Gordon cry out in pain, soon followed by a cry of distress of his wife.
The sessions Mike listens to in the meantime increasingly make clear what happened to their subject Mary and gradually the relationship with the events in the present become clear.
The movie cranks up the tension through a series of events until Gordon reaches a breaking point with tragic consequences. Not until the end we find out what really was at the beginning of this chain of events, which is a shocking reveal.
Apart from being a very suspenseful thriller it's also a surprisingly impressive study of the dark side within our nature, which under normal circumstances we can easily keep in check, the primitive purely based on primal instinct primate within us, which can suddenly surface under the right circumstances and make us do things which we wouldn't have conceived of beforehand. The atmosphere inside the decayed institution is like Gordon's inner life, where the ""asbestos"", so toxic to other people, as it turns out, cannot be removed in time and does its devastating work.",1223424000,2,4048,4.52387448840382

""Session 9"" is an odd film in that virtually no one has heard of it, but almost everyone who has sings its praises. After seeing it recommended for the third time online, I finally decided that I should probably watch it. Although I agree that this film is well made, especially considering its obviously low budget, overall, I was disappointed by it. Director Brad Anderson does a good job of setting the scene for something scary to happen and this is a very creepy film, but the problem is that Anderson takes too long to get to the payoff. This is a horror film, but the horror doesn't really start until about the one hour mark, making the ending seem all too abrupt, and when it did come, I didn't think it was much of a surprise. Based on this film, I think that Brad Anderson has what it takes to make a great horror movie, but this is not that film.",1220227200,3,1137,4.388625592417061
1666727,4,B00005UQ9F,"I wasn't going to write a review for this film but having read some of the negative (and I thought, in some cases, incredibly unjust) reviews, I felt I needed to.  Into what category (horror, psychological thriller, drama) Session 9 can be placed, I don't know and, frankly, I can care less because, ultimately, it doesn't make a lick of difference.  Yes, the movie is not for those who love their movies to be both obvious and engender immediate gratification.  In this film, the slow and methodical pacing pays off dividends in the end.  Just listening to the taped psychiatric sessions was enough to make my skin crawl and we know from the get go that Danvers is an incredibly haunted place and not in the spectral sense; however, something vicious and relentless broods and waits within those walls.  The movie is a bit on the slow side, I'll give you that and there are times when you feel like yelling ""speed it up"" but, again, it's deliberate pace allows the fear and vulnerability to torment the characters in a far more sadistic manner than if the movie were a rush job.  I notice some people mention that they like David Caruso's work on TV but not me.  As I rule, I dislike this gentleman's acting style something awful; it's monotone and predicable to the umpteenth power, but here, he's different.  He actually shows that he has considerable acting talent and I thought he was down right good.  For those who enjoy atmosphere and first rate art direction, you'll find a treasure trove of both in Session 9.  The cinematographer knows well what he's doing and the director's tight hold of the reins make certain that it all doesn't develop into a tired and hackneyed piece of celluloid.  I hesitate to give it 5 stars because I did find it a little too slow for its own good, as it risked losing its audience and, obviously, in many cases it did.  The movie would have, perhaps, benefited greatly from a more vigilant editing process.  Otherwise, no complaints. Session 9 is very much worth watching.",1219017600,,2012,4.649717514124294

I had forgotten the name of the film and it all but left my memory until, while home on college break a few years ago, I caught it in the middle of the night on Showtime. ""Oh yeah. This is that movie. Nothing else is on, so I might as well watch it."" I am so glad I did, and especially at that time! This was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had. Alone in the dark, and just on the brink of tired. Nothing will ever compare to that first time I saw it, but upon the subsequent viewings the film has still held up. The film, however, is certainly not for everyone. SESSION 9 typifies a narrative style that turns a good chunk of its audience off almost immediately. The film is not on the level of TIDELAND in its mystery and off-beat pacing, but it is along the same lines. We live in a ""what have you done for me lately"" society that has little patience for a film that demands attention with something other than pop and dazzle.

The film is a disjointed collection of scenes that attempts to be clever by keeping the audience guessing as to what troubling secret is plaguing the protagonist (who turns out to be the antagonist). It's an all-too cliche mechanism in movies for the past decade. It's just not done well anymore.

Another common affliction of ""horror"" films today is their uncanny ability to consistently create great implications and plot paths early on...and then drop them faster that you can say ""oops, I almost got scared"". For example, the tapes one character had discovered were a nice creepy way to unfold the story. However, that element was completely lost in the shuffle of ""clever"" editing.

The acting was actually excellent. But the writing was so fabulously weak as to bury the poor thespians despite their best efforts. The setting was also brilliant. However, it too became another casualty of the machine...churning out formulaic poop for all the live long day.

I put the local news on when I woke 6 days after first visiting the new ""condos"" on the site where this film was shot. It was Danvers State Hospital burning again!!! I couldn't believe my eyes and ears. I was there only last week for the first time in my life and here it was looking like Ground Zero. Yikes...I've lived only a half an hour from the infamous Hathorne Hill over my 39 years. I was finally drawn to it's walls when I first saw this film in 2006.

The Kirkbride buildings are not completely destroyed yet. They are saving three buildings which have been gutted and are going to be restored. But what of the tunnels? And what of the cemetary ""back there"". And all those bad vibes on the hill?

This film requires multiple viewings to understand Gordy's character. He is a ""weak"" or ""wounded"" man because of his meta-physical exhaustion due to the his newborn who is sick and keeping him and his wife up all night.

During the final segment you'll ""hear"" David Caruso's character tell Gordy to recall all of the ""boiling water"" incident. And if you listen closely you'll hear him ""silence"" everyone in the vicinity. The use of sound in this film is what makes it so penetrating.

There is nothing more ""scary"" or rather traumatizing than psychological horror. Why...because it's real and can happen to anyone.",1175990400,12,1335,4.569037656903766

The scenery was terrific, the setup had lots of promise, and the cinematography was eerie.  So, what went wrong?  Easy.... the plot was empty and as others have stated, nothing ever really came of anything.  There were a few build-ups with various characters discovering things in the hospital or finding out secrets but hardly any of it amounted to anything and this was disappointing.  Again, great camera work and the building was truly creepy.... but thats not what makes a great thriller. You have to have a solid story and believable suspense tactics and there simply weren't any.  And the characters....Uggggh!

The film tried desperately to develop each of the main characters but in most cases they were hard to care about and a few of them I would have gladly enjoyed seeing get killed in a slow, painful way.

Go ahead and try it if you'd like but I suspect that you will be underwhelmed as this film tries to make a feature length adventure/thriller out of a few cool wide-pan hallway shots and strange voices. Ultimately, it fails as a thriller and has a very light plot and mostly annoying characters.

However, it takes its sweet time (which I enjoy), and introduces you to the characters and location gradually. I will not spoil anything by giving away story details. Suffice to say that a small group of men are cleaning up an old, abandoned mental hospital, and things begin to get strange.

This is now easily one of my favorite haunted house films. Those who have seen it understand when I refer to ""the lightbulbs scene"". Wow. Or just listening to the session tapes gets under your skin fiercely.

This is not a slasher film, or a splattery mess of gore. Oh, it does get a bit gruesome. But this movie is more about what is hinted at, or what might happen. Like 'The Shining', 'Alien', or 'Don't Look Now', this movie makes you feel a deep sense of unease, which soon becomes dread.

Also, the records that are shown in the movie were also there. They never did take the records out and destroy them when the hosptial closed.

But Danvers State Mental Hospital, closed down for 15 years, is about to receive five new visitors. This is a brilliant example of horror filmaking on a shoe string budget. The basic storyline involves a hazardous waste disposal crew cleaning up a mental hospital which has been closed for 15 years.

There are rumors of patient abuse. One of the crew members discovers a series of haunting session recordings that draws him (as well as the viewer) into the depths of a young girl's torment. The acting is good,especially David Caruso's performance, understated, multi dimensioned and believable. The interior shots, where most of the movie takes place is shot in gritty gray/green tones the color of every old hospital, or institution.

The corridors are long and claustraphobic. The strands of each characters life begin to clash and emesh, moving at times in a slow moody crawal till at the end of the movie revelations flash by at breakneck speed. I found myself holding my breath as the tension grew to an almost unbearable level. The conclusion was a complete suprise to me.

Indeed it uses many of the same elements, especially the ""less is more"" principle.  There is almost no blood and gore in this movie and no special effects.  The creepiness is captured by a series of taped sessions with a mental patient who was housed in the asylum the movie is filmed in.

There are nine sessions in all, which are discovered and then played one at a time by a member of an asbestos removal crew that is working in the building.  The tapes are of a psychiatrist talking to a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder (not schizophrenia).  As the sessions progress other personalities talk through the woman.  Each mentions an entity named Simon that lives in the woman, but despite the doctor's best efforts he cannot convince Simon to speak - until the worker plays session 9, hence the title of the movie.

Along the way the asylum works on the minds of the crew, playing on each one's unique fears and weaknesses.  The finale is chilling as hell, really, really weird.

After viewing the incredible pictures on the Opacity website, I then discovered Session 9.  I first rented the movie, then I bought it on Amazon. I watch the movie, not only because of the story, but to see what no longer exists at the Danvers Asylum site.  The ""extras"" on the DVD show how beautiful this Kirkbride designed building is, but the experiences of the cast and crew.  The extras, in my humble opinion, are better than the movie itself.

Thomas Kirkbride, the architect of several ""insane asylums"" on the east coast and elsewhere, built beautiful victorian buildings for the insane, in order to becalm the unfortunate inhabitants.  Unfortunately, these ""castles"" were stretched to the limit with the population of the insane.  They were shut down in the 1970s and onward due to overcrowding and reports of abuse.  Danvers was shut down in the 1990s and was left to decay.  Danvers was on the Historic Register of Historic Places, but was sold by the town of Danvers to Avalon Bay, a nation-wide company who specializes in up-scale apartment living.

Do I recommend this movie!  You bet I do!  I recommend it because Danvers no longer exists and I recommend it for the suspense and the story line.  But I recommend it for anyone who loves beautiful old buildings in this country that are being destroyed in the name of commerce and the lack of feeling.  I thank God this movie exists.

1666785,5,B00005UQ9F,"In ""Session 9"", Brad Anderson offers far more than a fleeting, horrifying experience. Even though the main focus remains on psychological terror, he is not afraid to reach deep into social realism as well (an immigrant's dream gone wrong). Many factors contribute to the overall superior quality of this film: 1) The place itself - the abandoned Danvers Mental Hospital - is terrifying with its peeling walls, dark tunnels, kitchen meat hooks, lingering asbestos threat, and most of all, its history of patient abuse and lobotomy procedures - all this in a vast, labyrinth-like scale. 2) Unlike most directors of horror films these days, Anderson does not rush the plot or attack the audience with unbelievable monsters, overdone gore, and other nonsensical features that satisfy only lazy thinkers seeking uncomplicated, instant gratification. When the Hazmat Elimination Co. workers enter the hospital (ready to complete a difficult, yet well-paid job), led by their boss Gordon (Peter Mullan), Anderson lets the suspense build up slowly, giving away a hint only here and there. At the same time, everything is perfectly coordinated and attention is paid to the smallest details - every character has a secret (except for Jeff whose fear of dark is revealed at the beginning), natural sounds and sights are used in strange circumstances (e.g. loud crickets in the afternoon, a spider's image and a bird's peep tied to each new level of Gordon's disturbing thoughts) , the workers' white suits and the plastic partitions around them intensify the unsafe, claustrophobic ambience, and let's not forget the equally effective, frightening musical score! The camera work is fantastic - there is a number of outstanding close-up shots throughout the film. Every actor has greatly contributed to the ultimate success of the film, but Peter Mullan as Gordon deserves an extra applause - an excellent actor without a doubt, his multiple, intense facial expressions remain etched in my memory. 3) And then there's the real case of Mary Hobbes and her multiple personality disorder - the few photos of her shown throughout the film make the horror uncomfortably and effectively authentic. (The voice-over actress for her three voices - Mary, Princess, and Billy - did a frighteningly great job.)  And the voice of the evil itself - Simon - kept cleverly at the distance until the end when Gordon's and Mary's personal stories converge with a horrifying force. This film is a true gem if one takes the time to understand it - minute by minute, day by day, session by session - until the ultimate session 9!",1158451200,9,2596,5.093896713615023

Additionally, it is interesting to see how elements of psychology and actual side effects of treatment were combined within the film.  A side effect of art therapy in the 70's was suicidality and delusions.  Additionally, the ending scene is straight out of the effects of lobotomy as well.  After a lobotomy, some individuals exhibit spasms where the arms and legs flail.

Shots of the building are impressive, and throughout the first forty-five minutes or so, there is a sense of impending dead. As others have said, this movie resembles The Shining in certain aspects: isolated characters in a huge structure seemingly in the middle of nowhere.

Now, the bad.

The ending was truly one of the most confusing I have ever seen. There is no explanation given as to why the killer did what they did: motivation, nothing at all.

The characters were one dimensional. Zero depth or character development. No tension between the characters, which would have made this far more interesting to watch.

The plot: all buildup but unfortunately, there is no payoff whatsoever.

The suspence is severely lacking in the second half of the film. And throughout the entire film, there is only one scene which is pretty scary.

Mainly a psychological thriller. Four cleaning guys clean asbestos out of an abandoned insane asylum. Soon they start hearing noises and go meandering curiously.  That's when the fun starts.  Great plot with creepy lighting and sound effects.  Highly recommended!  Pick this up next time you are at the video store!! Your feedback of the movie would be appreciated.

1666802,5,B00005UQ9F,"Friday the 13th always made me giggle; computer generated special effects bore me. If you are a fan of the old black and white Twilight Zones, early David Lynch films and like spooky abandoned Victorian buildings, you're in for a scary treat! Next, add a cast that seems made for their roles and you're in (a good scary movie kind of) hell.

Each character is a mix of bravado and vulnerability.  David Caruso keeps you guessing. Peter Mullan is brilliant as the desperate man with marital problems. Josh Lucas with his electric eyes, smirks and tattoos (in the film) are perfect for mischief making and going to places you don't want to visit. Stephen Gevedon is calm with an underlying darkness that gently envelopes you into its lair. Brendan Sexton III is strangely charming as the mouthy mullet head kid with little boy fears. Although we've seen the line ""F--- you!"" delivered in too many movies to count, David Caruso, with those eyes and finger pointing, makes it new and unforgettable.

Sounds are also very important in this film. The occasional music makes use of the Beatles ""Number Nine"" variety with its backwards notes. A boom box that might add some cheer to a large echoy room is turned off since it might unhinge particles that ""go into your lungs and create little time bombs"" (I don't recall the exact line). A cell phone ends up disconnecting characters from themselves. The old tape player of Mary Hobbe's sessions helps bring a sense of going back in time to when it was originally recorded. Dripping water from leaky ceilings and bumps in the night are used sparingly. There are no cheap tricks in this film. Every detail is a set up for the grand unraveling.

The imagination can generate horror far better than any special effects. You'll love the way this film coaxes you into a world of madness that you can almost understand. Now that is scary.

The DVD has cut scenes and an alternative ending that you should not miss.",1141516800,10,1949,4.703812316715543
1666803,5,B00005UQ9F,"When I first heard from this I never really thought about it that much. At the time it felt like the cheap slasher flicks in the modern days have brought the horror genre to an end, losing its true meaning. Still there was something about the movie saying, 'I could be wrong' - and without a doubt, I was. Session 9 is one of those films that show that blood and gore is not required to bring horror to its finest. It's a film that relies strictly on psychological horror to make its point.

The film contains an all male cast who gives great performances throughout, who are brought together as a team to work on an abandoned insane asylum, in preparation for renovation.

Session 9 doesn't exactly have truly terrifying scenes. Instead, within the asylum, it contains the elements of fear and paranoia with a great deal of atmosphere within the structure, of its actual existence, and realism excluding the effect of darkness. With extremely limited violence and no special effects-(the one thing horror does not need whatsoever), which is all the more reason to see it.

The greatest thing about Session 9 is how the horror isn't clearly thrown in your face, but drags you through certain events, characters backgrounds and motifs, and creepy voice sessions, letting the horror build slowly but surely, allowing you to think for yourself, bringing it to the conclusion that is original and rock solid.

I found this film to be very interesting from start to finish.  Excellent acting from a highly underated cast, excellent plot that was well told, no evidence of cheap scares anywhere and a little creepy in some places.

This film was very chilling.  It's brilliant story and puzzling characters hold it together like an old man with a new hip.

I gave this movie 3 stars, even though it was very good I thought it needed a tiny bit more suspence and thrills.  The musical score was very simple but in some places very constant and repetitive.

1666806,4,B00005UQ9F,"Between 'Session 9' and 'The Machinist' Brad Anderson has established himself as a horror director to watch for. (Now I know you're telling me 'The Machinist' isn't a horror movie, but a 'Psychological Thriller'. True enough, but that's close enough for me, and it still amounts to maybe 3/4 of horror film, and the 3/4 that matter the most at that.) Hopefully it'll turn out that he's really particularly interested in horror films, rather than he just happened to make those 2 films. Good new horror director's are in relatively short supply, and the old guard is gettin' pretty old by now. Anyway, many of the more hyped horror films of recent years make a big deal out of being a return to gruesome, hard-hitting horror of the 70's. Anderson takes a different approach, stripping away the violence largely and focusing on visuals and atmosphere. I like pretty much all approaches to horror, but I think this one is the very best, provided it has some sort of payoff at some point. And, frankly, I think 'Session 9' takes this approach a little too far, and could stand for a little more payoff, perhaps few more concrete occurrences in the first 70 minutes of the film. Still, it works very well as it is, even if Anderson tries to push the material a little too far.

Like so many of the better horror films, 'Session 9' is scenario, rather than plot, oriented. Basically, a Hazmat crew is sent into the old, abandoned Danvers mental hospital in order to clean out the asbestos in preparation for renovation. (They had to close it down some years before, cause all the patients were going crazy! haha, haha,ha, [clears throat] haha. Ahh.  Not actually true by the way, closed down due to scandals and a lack of funds.) It is, in short, a Haunted House film, a crazy house, in this case. It was the Danvers hospital (in Massachusetts, I believe) itself that inspired the film, and it was shot there pretty much entirely on location, apparently with a relative minimum of set decoration. It's a very creepy place no matter how you look at it; Huge and imposing but it also looks like it might fall apart at any moment and full of all sorts of disturbing little things that remind you that this is indeed a mental hospital, along with the just generally harsh and angular architecture. There are a number of particularly disturbing images: the long, underground tunnels; an old restraint chair located directly in the center of a large room; the mesh fences used to separate the patients from the staff and prevent suicides. Some of the more negative reviews have claimed that the locale is pretty much all the film has going for it. Even if that were the case, this might not be too bad of a film.  It's just a great locale.

During the commentary track it's mentioned that 'The Shining' was a major inspiration for the film. This isn't hard to see, as the camerawork often mimics that film extensively, particularly while they're exploring the hospital. (It also has some similar plot elements, in that it's a haunted place that adversely effects the occupants' psyches rather than simply killing them personally.) 'Session 9' is also particularly interesting in that it has a cast that is far different from what you'd usually see in a horror film: The main characters are all male, blue collar workers. Though the film doesn't have an overwhelming amount of character development, these guys are all generally pretty sympathetic, in that they tend to be particularly concerned with real-world issues, and just generally seem like regular guys rather than film characters. Performances are strong across the board, particularly for a film with such a small budget. (1.5 million, I'm told.)

Like I said, the film is pretty slow-moving, with most of what happens in the first half of the film simply amounting to spooky cinematography, eerie, atonal music, voices and the disturbing tapes found in the library by one of the characters. (They're recordings of therapeutic sessions with one Mary, a murderer with multiple personalities. This seems like a somewhat hackneyed device, but it worked on me. When the murderous Simon personality finally appears on the tape he proves to be really very creepy.) We also get to see how the hospital effects each of them personally, as most of them seems to have a particular obsession related to the job which eats at them more and more as the film moves on. At about the 70 minute mark things really start to fall apart, though it is still fairly restrained in a lot of ways. Much of the time we don't really get to see what happened at the time, only the aftermath. I'd never say the film really gets to be out and out terrifying, but it's pretty creepy and intense in these later moments.

The final revelation isn't especially impressive, but I don't think they were really expecting for it to be too mind blowing or anything. It mostly just helps to keep us in the dark a bit to enhance the mood. There is one very cool revelation towards the end, that I can't give away in specific. (It involves a certain character who disappeared midway thru the movie and has returned acting very strangely. The neat thing is why he's acting the way he does.)

Ehh, I got nothing else to say. I liked it.

Personally, I watch movies to be entertained and as a form of escape, not to have to interpret dreams and delusions in some vain attenpt to figure out what the characters are meaning or experiencing through their bizarre and undecipherable mind trips.

I found the plot scattered, the music annoying, and the end totally worthless.  Not enough information was given to the standard movie-goer to fully understand what was happening with the characters, and unless you are a psychotherapist yourself you would probably have a great deal of trouble figuring out what the heck is going on.

When I watch a movie I at least like to be able to concretely understand the motives of the killer. Was he somehow related to the hospital? Was he possessed by the spirit of Simon (before or after he started renovating the hospital)?

1666822,2,B00005UQ9F,"I like the horror genre as much as the next twisted individual. I enjoy being scared out of my chair, covering my eyes during certain graphic moments, sitting glued to my seat as some character you've become emotionally vested in opens a door you know should NEVER be opened. But this film delivered on none of those.

First, let's start with the films basic outline: a group of Hazmat workers have contracted to clean up the abandoned Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusetts. It's a creepy looking monstrosity-of-a-building which seems to develop as a sort of character all on its own. And as the workers delve into the building's rooms, they find little odds and ends that attract each worker: one finding coins and rings; another finding interview tapes (9 of them) from a patient with multiple personality disorder; and still another worker finds ...insanity and death.

Where this film fell down was in plot. It didn't seem to have one or --- probably more likely --- was buried so deep in the film's nuances that you'd be hard-pressed to find it with a microscope. Now I'm not asking for everything to be spelled out in black and white for me (in fact, I HATE that), but film makers also need to be conscious of not losing their audience completely.

Let me explain. If the makers of this movie wanted me to understand the motivation of the terrible things that happened in this place and their effects on the Hazmat team, they utterly flopped at doing so. I have no idea why one of the team members began killing everyone around him. Or what influence the building had on him. Or if he was somehow connected with the hospital at some point in his life. Or what ""the lobotomy chair"" had to do with any of it.

There's a reason this film hasn't sold well and is not available at most video rental stores. It'll only appeal to those who absolutely love disassociated threads in a movie's message. But that's certainly not for me. I need at least one thread to hang on to.",1129248000,6,1976,4.589235127478753

However, the main way of bringing fear to the viewers is through the building of tension and the calm before the storm, which I have always loved.

1666827,5,B00005UQ9F,"Plot: Danvers Asylum has been closed for a long time now. A cleaning crew has been assigned to remove all of the harmful chemicals and such that have built up throughout the building over the years. They must do this in only one week. The problem is, Danvers is a massive place. It will be quite stressful, but the men need the job. Surely enough, the old asylum begins to work on the crew's nerves. Although they are together, working side-by-side everyday, they each become more and more withdrawn to their own thoughts inspired by the creepy building. One member of the crew has discovered a series of old audio recordings of a psychiatrist and an inpatient named Mary -- a dissociative woman with multiple personalities. Something horrible had happened -- the thing that landed her in the asylum. And, as the tapes go on, more and more is revealed. Session number nine, the last session, holds the key to what happened and why Mary is so disturbed as she is. Terrifyingly enough, one crew member has been driven to the same edge. And, before the week is over, the tension becomes too much. Death occurs, and horrors beyond the boundaries of any sane imagination take over.

Session 9, upon the first viewing, is one of the creepiest films you could ask for. It's one of those ""it's not what you see, it's what you don't see"" feelings of dread that haunt the audience in the same way the characters are haunted. You never know what's going to happen. But don't think it's just another fix for a Saturday night creep-out. It is also great for multiple viewings because, it seems, each time you watch it, you catch little bits and pieces you didn't notice before that really get you thinking. Even though you'll know what happens at the end, you'll still find it plenty enjoyable just to see it all unfold time after time. Plus, the Session 9 DVD has some great special features, including a documentary on Danvers (yep, it's a real place) and the filming of the movie, deleted scenes, and more (as a little hint, you might want to use the director's commentary on the deleted scenes in order to understand how they fit into the plot).

It's a fantastic place (the building I mean, playing the biggest part of the story) haunted by memory, but it's psychological -not supernatural.

Having seen every ""classic"" horror film ever made, I can say that this film is easily as scary as several of those movies.  Session 9 has the perfect mixture of modern and traditional horror, and it works better than several horror films that are strictly contemporary (the WAY overated The Ring) or old fasioned (Halloween).

The movie is about 5 guys being hired to clear out the Danvers Mental Hospital, an abandoned hospital that really exists and is considered haunted.  The film was shot on location at the asylum.  The workers are supposed to work on site for a week, and then recieve a 10,000 dollar bonus for their quick work (and as a reward for not rushing off in a hurry to leave the hospital).  On the first day of the excavation, one of the workers discovers a box labeled EVIDENCE.  Inside are a set of audio tapes that are audio ""interviews"" with an old patient at the hospital.  There are nine tapes, nine sessions.  Throughout the movie, we hear more and more of the tapes, and thus we learn more about the patient, Mary.  We learn she is a multi-personality schitzophrenic (she has 4 personalities), and that she is also violent, when the right personality is revealed.  Every scene with Mary (or Billy, or Princess, or Simon) is through audio, and they create a forboding atmosphere in themselves.  The tapes tie into the rest of the film at the very end, which is violent and unexpected.

I feel asleep the first time I saw it, but something kept me watching it everytime it came on. The atmosphere of the movie and the whole abandoned building/mental hospital is what kept my interest. The idea that this could happen in real life I think is what makes this one truely good. If there were any monsters or killers-that-just-wouldn't-die, it just wouldn't be good.

1666846,3,B00005UQ9F,"Don't get me wrong. This movie is not bad. The problem is, it's not really bad-ass either. This is all very strange because it has all the ingredients it needs. Great actors, good story & great scenography. The environments cash in most points for this movie. Very ""Silent Hill"" minus the monsters. Just take a look at the front of the DVD case and you'll understand. So what is wrong with it? The first thing is the pacing of the movie. For the first hour, you're not sure if this is a horror movie or a drama. It seems more like a story of five worker class men and their personal problems. They all have their quirks like fear of the dark, domestic problems, depression and so on. That feeling of ""there probably are no ghosts in this house"" surfaces after an hour of sighing and back streching. Just their personal demons, so to speak - which aren't very scary. You feel more sorry for the bastars than being scared for them. Over time, however the situation deteriorates as they start loosing it one by one. So why am I not scared yet? Because it's all just sooo predictable. Sure there are hints of a supernatural, evil presence in the dark halls, but there just had to be, right? Otherwise this WOULD be drama/mystery. They should have went for the asian horror approach. Where tight budgets force film makers to rely on storytelling and simple camera ingenuety to create that heavy tension that you can almost cut through with a knife. Not from of what you've seen, but from what you know. ""Session 9"" is definitely a step in the right direction from all those sucky slasher movies, but dispite all that budget it's still no match for asian horror like the ""Ringu"" trilogy, ""Juon"", ""Dark Waters"" and ""The Eye"". If you're All American and can't stand subtitles and foreighn laguages, I suggest you watch ""The Ring"" (am. remake of jap. ""Ringu"") and/or ""The Mothman Prophecies"".

1666848,5,B00005UQ9F,"Danvers State Mental Hospital has stood empty for 15 years, after being shut down in 1985 due to scandal and budget cuts. Now it is a gigantic labyrinth (about the size of a small town) of moldering hallways, rooms, and offices. Built in 1871, Danvers is also a toxic hazard, full of asbestos floor tiles and crocolodite ceiling panels. Enter the Hazmat Elimination Co., the team that just outbid the competition by claiming to be able to do the clean-up job in a week, instead of the normal, more rational 3 week period. Gordon is Hazmat's boss, and he needs the money. You see, something terrible has just happened in his life that we are only given tiny clues and glimpses of before the true terror unfolds. Phil (David Caruso) has worked for Hazmat a long time and fears that Gordon may be wading slowly into the deep end. The rest of the crew includes Hank, a goof-off with a gift for sarcasm, Jeff, who is Gordon's nephew and has a serious case of nichtophobia (yep, he's afraid of the dark), and Mike, a law student with a calm nature and quite possibly the group's only brain. Danvers unleashes it's horror like a time-release capsule of dread, effecting these men in small ways, building up in them like the toxic dust they certainly must be breathing. Beneath it's silence and peeling paint, Danvers is a repository of the evils that transpired within it's walls. Hank stumbles upon a near fortune in old coins, glasses, and gold and silver teeth hidden in the bricks. It is when he returns alone by night, set on taking his treasure and leaving the state, that the real malevolence of Danvers shows it's shadow-covered face. Meanwhile, Mike has found a box full of session tapes for patient Mary Hobbes, that turn out to be the largest piece we'll get to the puzzle of Danvers Mental Hospital. SESSION 9 is an overlooked classic of mounting tension and invisible hauntings. Don't expect CGI boogeymen or cheap ""jump"" scenes every two minutes, this is a creeper that delivers it's jolts and shudders over time, making us squirm uncomfortably through the whole bloody thing!

1666859,4,B00005UQ9F,"Session 9 is an original and effective psychological thriller. The setting for the film is just perfect. I don't think that any setting can be more melancholy than a dilapidated 19th century mental asylum. The story involves 5 professional exterminationists who are given the job of demolishing the Danvers Mental Institution. As the days progress, however, the building starts to play on their various fears and secrets. For example, the lights go out, shadowy figures lurk in dark hallways, etc.

It's the type of film which gives you the creeps but doesn't scare you as such. At least, that's how I found it. Although the acting is very solid and the atmosphere is morose, I think the film could have been a little better. For example, I think they could have added a few more supernatural goings-on. Also, I'm not sure whether I can always agree with the notion that what you don't see is always scarier than what you do. If it's shot correctly, then I would say it's the other way around. For example, the film Jacob's Ladder was far scarier for me than Session 9.

Naturally, it's not good to have too many shock scenes because then the movie starts to lose it's momentum and the audience simply becomes accustomed to the gore and scare tactics. However, a few more in Session 9 wouldn't have caused that to happen. There are nice extras on the Reg 2 DVD with deleted scenes/alternate ending, commentary, trailers, etc. In my opinion, I think they were right to delete most of those scenes because they would have spoiled an ambitious and brave film.

For example, the deleted scenes contain a dirty homeless woman living in the mental asylum and observing what the five men are doing to each other as the film progresses. I think it was a bad idea. For a start, how would she live, where would she find food, water, medicine, etc?",1112918400,,1837,4.66358024691358
1666860,5,B00005UQ9F,"I don't want to call this a horror movie. It is not particularly frightening.  I don't want to call it a thriller, because it moves at a very slow and steady pace.  I WOULD like to call it a suspense film, because from start to finish, there is a certain tension that you may not be able to put your finger on, but will haunt you even as the closing credits begin to roll.

  Session 9 is the story of an asbestos cleaning crew, working to clean out Danvers Insane Asylum (a real location, beautifully used in the film) within a week, an extremely difficult deadline given the size and scope of the job.  Their motivation is a substantial bonus if they meet their deadline.

  But tensions start to rise among the members of the crew...  Something about the building perhaps that seems to be bringing it out in them.  And, as the movie churns forward, you will discover that some of the men have may be hiding something as well.

  Director Brad Anderson keeps a slow and steady pace throughout, only escalating the pace in the final thrilling minutes.  He uses his gorgeous location to great effect.  The exterior of the hospital is gorgeous in itself, and is captured with some great aerial shots, but the deteriorating interior, with dripping pipes, slick floors, and graffiti covered walls, is haunting and leaves a lasting impression.  The sound effects and music help drive the film, and never feel out of place.  Everything is captured on high-definition digital video, I believe, but seems fitting.

  The acting is phenomenal throughout, and the movie feels almost like a character study rather than a suspense film.  And although it is not scary necessarily, (the IDEA behind it is a bit frightening), the film often draws comparisons to Kubrick's The Shining, and the comparisons are fitting.  Both films use enormous, lonely, abandoned buildings to generate tension and bring out the worst in their characters, and use steadily sweeping cameras to great effect, and both films are divided in to days, using titles (""Monday"") in similar fashion.

  The bottomline, then, is this: Session 9 is a terrific little suspense film.  If you are disappointed at first, I might suggest giving it another try.  For me, each viewing is more enjoyable than the last, and it was not until the second that I began to really appreciate it's genius.  Recommended.",1110758400,,2358,4.796019900497512

The problem with this movie unlike most horror flicks, is that it seems to be something that could happen the exact same way in real life. Now, I say problem in a good way.

1666863,5,B00005UQ9F,"...and an excellent film!

I am scratching my head over G. Haugen's review. I, also, am a huge fan of THE OTHER, TCM, and THE SHINING, and right after viewing this, I let some of my fellow psycho-logical horror fan friends know just how highly I think of this. I am surprised to see someone with such taste give this only one star.

Unlike most mainstream horror flicks, this one takes its time in developing the characters.

Gordon and Bill are heading a remodeling project in an old abandoned mental institute. It is revealed early on that Gordon has been having some family problems, and Bill has been involved in some shady business. The crew members are comprised of an intellectual law school dropout, a not-so-bright, but good hearted mullet head, and a free spirit.

Each character becomes sort of drawn to something in the building. The intellectual starts sneaking off into the basement to listen to recordings of sessions of a woman w/ multiple personalities, the free spirit discovers hidden treasure, and the mullet head can only work in a limited capacity because of fear of the dark.

As the intellectual listens to a new session each day, the tension among the crew grows stronger, and it remains like this up to the chilling end.

Don't worry, I didn't reveal anything. I just felt compelled to review this after reading that last review. All of you psychological horror buffs should think of this as a ""second opinon""

The features on the dvd were great. The alternate ending is worth watching.",1104969600,2,1512,4.7701149425287355
1666864,5,B00005UQ9F,"I read about this one in an issue of ""All Hallows"" magazine, and decided to take a look... I was impressed enough to buy a copy after renting it!
  Low budget flick, that I think was direct to DVD.  Too bad, I'd like to see this one on a big screen.  I had reservations at first, since I think David Caruso is a bonehead, but he turned in a great performance, along with the rest of the cast, much to my surprise.  The real star however, is the location.
  Filmed in an actual abandoned lunatic asylum, this is the scariest damn building I think I've ever seen.  You couldn't pay me enough, or even buy me enough beer to spend a night in this place(and I DO love my beer)!!
  The story builds slowly to a fascinating climax.  As someone else stated, there is not a lot of gore, but that's fine with me.  What gets to you is a gradually increasing aura of dread at what you don't see (for kind of the same effect, check out the original 1960 film version of ""The Haunting"").  This is a slow and relatively subtle film that really pays off.
  Oddball camera work, a chilling score, believable (if sometimes irritating!) characters and an incredible location all add up to a winner.  I do recommend viewing this film at least twice however, as it has what I call a ""What the fxxk"" ending.  A second viewing is definitely worthwhile, as a lot of missed details reveal themselves that really clear things up (a bit!).
Finally, watch this one alone in a dark room for maximum effect, as this is an intelligent horror film that deserves all the attention and ""atmosphere"" you can give it.  I wish they made more of 'em like this!",1104710400,3,1622,4.35

1666866,4,B00005UQ9F,"The most audacious element of ""Session 9"" is that it takes place during the day time and while there are some moments involving shadows there is only a brief bit of one sequences that actually ends up in the dark.  You do no think of bright light as being an omnipresent element in what is essentially a haunted house film, but director Brad Anderson clearly wants to scare his audience when the lights are on.  Anderson used to drive past the enormous Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusetts (built in the 1887s, condemned in 1984, and closed in 1992), which inspired the script by Anderson and his co-writer Stephen Gevedon (who plays Mike).  In that regard ""Session 9"" reminds me of Herke Harvey's classic low-budget horror film, ""Carnival of Souls.""  But the location that inspired Anderson's film is central to the entire film, and not simply the setting for the climax.

Gordon Fleming (Peter Mullan) shows up with his Hazmat Elimination Company crew to remove asbestos from the abandoned mental hospital.  This is dangerous enough work, where the type of music you play on your boom box could literally be dangerous to your health, but of course asbestos will be the least of their worries.  There is a big bonus involved if the job is done in a week, and while Phil (David Caruso) has his doubts, they have to try.  The rest of the crew consists of Hank (Josh Lucas), whom Phil does not trust for a lot of reasons, Jeff (Brendan Sexton III), a nephew who is new to the work, and Mike (Gevedon), who is well-read enough to provide the necessary exposition regarding the place they are working on at lunch time.

In real world history the hospital is supposed built on the site of the house of Jonathan Hathorne, one of the most fanatical judges of the witchcraft trials of Massachusetts.  Originally the Danvers State Hospital was an attempt to treat patients with delusions by bringing them to beautiful surroundings and fresh air.  But by the start of the 20th century too many patients and not enough money led to a radical shift in treatment and procedures at Danvers so that shock treatments, hydrotherapy, and lobotomies were used to control the patients (although it is not true that Danvers was where lobotomies were invented).  Once abandoned, the giant structure quickly gained a reputation for being haunted, no doubt by the ghosts of the abused patients.

Mike tells of a more specific horror story, and we know from other horror films to always pay attention to the back-story.  It seems that once upon a time there was a young girl who was being treated who told an incredible story about very wicked things, except that what she said happened could not have happened.  The story is told by Mike to explain why the place closed down, but we know better.  That story contains clues as to what is going on, especially when Mike stumbles across the reel-to-reel tapes of the actual sessions (guess how many there were).  While everybody is racing to meet the deadline, Mike is spending his time listening to the sessions of the Doctor and the young girl.  As the others explore the building, there are other disturbing remnants of what used to happen in this place, and the fact that such things are discovered in the light of day does not lessen their impact.

""Session 9"" is certainly a stylish horror film, which is not to suggest it is devoid of substance.  But like so many of its kindred spirits I find the payoff to be less than satisfying (which is a complaint I have about ""Apocalypse Now"" as well, so take that for what it is worth).  Still, when the greatest sin in a horror film is that you see the end coming, I do not think most viewers will be able to figure out how everything fits together, although they should figure out the ""who.""  The atmosphere of ""Session 9"" is on target, mainly because unlike a lot of contemporary horror films, there is no attempt to force it by letting the music do all the heavy lifting and there are no special effects to induce stomach churning and worse.  ""Session 9"" is interested in true terror and not the inelegant gross out.  That alone makes it worth watching, even if turning out all the lights does little to enhance the experience.",1103500800,14,4207,4.654054054054054

Jason, Michael, the Blair Witch, the Devil himself - they would all run screaming from the dark corridors and beautiful, sickening abandoned rooms that are the real monsters in this movie.

1666868,5,B00005UQ9F,"This film is one of the greatest suspense films of all times and yet has received so little attention. The director combines the suggestion of madness along with the weakness of the wounded human psyche to create a thrilling yet subtle terror movie.

Brad Anderson directs this film along the same route as Hitchcock, adding dim lighting, the illusion of fear and suggestions of madness around each and every bend. Filmed at Danvers State Mental Hospital the building itself is as creepy as can be with haunting hallways and torture gadgets, used on the unlucky and insane, lurking in every corner. Anderson allows this story to unfold without being overly graphic or campy. A five man crew is hired by the state to clean up the old hospital and rid it of the asbestos that is contaminating its walls but much to their surprise other contaminations exist. David Caruso is the crew negotiator suffering from anger related issues towards the crew man who stole his wife. His partner, Peter Mullan, is the first to become unknowingly sensitive to the evil that lurks in the walls. Another crew member discovers tapes in the basement that reveal the trauma of a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder and opens up more than he imagines. So in one week the crew is faced with various events that lead to a frightening conclusion.

Anderson opens up the definition of madness leading one to believe that we all carry a bit of it inside of us waiting to be ignited. In today's world where medication is the treatment rather than lobotomies it is a scary thought. Anderson manages to trigger our senses with eerie tapes and looming walls, suspending his viewers within the gloom of an empty madhouse.

1666891,4,B00005UQ9F,"Very few films from Hollywood rate as truly creepy or horrifying. I can think of a few off the top of my head, the best being Stanley Kubrick's terrifying adaptation of Stephen King's ""The Shining."" The George C. Scott vehicle ""The Changeling"" is capable of striking a few chilly chords, as is the intensely unsettling British made for television version of ""The Woman in Black"" (not Hollywood, I know, but it counts in the general sense of scary movies). Obviously, a few more are floating around out there, with the most recent addition to this select list being Brad Anderson's 2001 film ""Session 9."" Here's a film that completely snuck in under my radar. I don't know if it had a theatrical release three years ago, but if it did I never heard a word about it. Since I don't go to the movie theater on a regular basis, preferring instead to enjoy all types of cinema on DVD in the comfort of my home, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised that I heard nothing about Anderson's picture. But after watching this creepfest, I figured SOMEONE would have told me something about ""Session 9."" Maybe a friend did; I was quite busy with school back in 2001 and didn't have as much time to watch and talk about films as I do now.

The plot outline here is rather simple-at least initially. A hazardous waste company run by Gordon Fleming (Peter Mullan) accepts a contract to remove asbestos in the decrepit Danvers building. It's a big job, one of the biggest this little company has ever had, but Fleming's financial and personal life is in a bit of a pickle and he really needs the work. Against the better judgment of his co-worker Phil (David Caruso), Gordon promises to finish the job in one week instead of two or three. His promise is incredible considering he only has himself, Phil, Mike (Stephen Gevedon), Hank (Josh Lucas), and Jeff (Brendan Sexton III) to help with the assignment. These guys are good, but are they good enough to finish this massive undertaking? Perhaps, but as the work week progresses issues arise that cast grave doubts on completing the task. For one thing Fleming starts acting weird, and not in an amusing way. He's distant and spends a lot of time fussing around with his cell phone. The behavior of the boss exacerbates divisions between Phil and Hank, divisions started some time before when Hank wooed away Phil's wife. Too, Mike has his issues. He's a smart guy who dropped out of law school and has since drifted aimlessly through life. As for Jeff, he's just trying to learn the job and make a little money at his uncle's business.

The whole situation rapidly deteriorates once Mike discovers a series of tape recordings in a room in the basement. These recordings consist of interviews conducted by the hospital staff with Mary Hobbes, a patient who suffered from a multiple personality disorder. Mike becomes fascinated with the weird, eerie voices on the old reels, and sneaks away from work whenever he can to listen to them. In the meantime, strange noises in the hospital start distracting the other workers. Then Hank disappears after discovering a cache of coins and other trinkets in the basement. Perhaps something not of this world inhabits the dark recesses of this depressing building. Perhaps somebody or something means to do great harm to Gordon, Phil, Mike, Hank, and Jeff. Or maybe it's all in their heads. One thing is for sure: danger lurks around every corner, nothing is as it seems, and the end is sure to deliver bloody shocks in a way not apparent until well into the film.

Brad Anderson did a couple of several very smart things with ""Session 9."" First, he chose an amazingly creepy location for the film, the abandoned and run down Danvers State Insane Asylum in Massachusetts. This building reeks of doom and gloom, and Anderson's camera captures the wide-open spaces of the wards as effectively as it peeks into the dank, dark recesses of the basement tunnels and rooms. Occasionally, the camera zooms over the edifice from high above so we get an idea of the sheer immensity of this structure. Second, and most importantly, Anderson hired a cast of great actors to fill critical roles. The standout here is probably Caruso, an actor I've never had an affinity for in his other roles. In ""Session 9"" the actor's seriousness and increasing concern as the weirdness becomes too much to bear carries a ring of truth. You could see a real person doing the things Caruso's character does. Mullan's good too, and he's downright ominous when the final revelation emerges in the end. What doesn't work as well is a conclusion that's too pat and, frankly, somewhat confusing. What exactly happened at Danvers? What do the nine session tapes have to do with the final disaster? Is there any connection between the institution and the actions of the characters? ""Session 9"" raises more questions than answers.

The DVD contains many extras. A commentary track, an alternate ending, deleted scenes, and a featurette help provide a few clues to this enigmatic film. Although I scratched my head at the ending, ""Session 9"" is a film every horror fan will want to watch. The filmmakers throw buckets of atmosphere at you, the soundtrack recalls the fractured, noisy music of ""The Shining,"" and there's even a bit of gore for the sauce lovers to savor. I would definitely watch Anderson's film again, and probably ought to since this type of film usually reveals more answers on subsequent viewings. Give it a shot.",1094947200,52,5463,4.76557550158395
1666892,5,B00005UQ9F,"Session 9 is the type of horror movie that does not rely on special-effects, giant celebrities, or tons of undeserved press to make it popular and scary. It is psychological, it never got very big, and it should have. People who say this movie isn't in the same league as ""the Sixth Sense"" or ""the Ring"" are right.. this movie is actually SCARY.

As mentioned before, the location where this was shot is really ominous and cool. There are a lot of really sinister shots in the movie that have stayed with me afterwards... the wheelchair... the photos... the tunnel in which the boy, Jeff, finds himself in at one point... the imagery in this movie is amazing and haunting.

Also mentioned before is the use of music and sound effects. To me, one of the most disturbing parts of the movie was the audio from the session tapes that plays over the action. The tapes are old, and warped. Listening to the different voices on the session tapes as they play and become garbled in points is chilling.

The acting is great as well. I also found the characters likeable and believable. The use of a dangerous-materials-removal crew I found interesting and different. There are no primping, preening Hollywood pinup boys here. Just a bunch of guys, and they are extraordinarily NORMAL.

All this said, Session 9 scared me. I live in a basement apartment and after watching this movie, I felt very uncomfortable with my choice of living spaces (it being 4 AM at the time.) The Blair Witch Project also scared the hell out of me, and I hear that people either love it or hate it. I think Session 9 appeals and frightens in the same way, to the same type of people, that Blair Witch does. It is a movie that you will think about and discuss afterwards. And it is definitely scary. The ending left me completely nervous and unsettled. ""The weak and the wounded...."" it was sad and sickening and heartwrenching all at once.

Highly, highly recommended. :)",1094860800,2,1940,4.611594202898551
1666893,5,B00005UQ9F,"Horror movies usually don't faze me.  Often the only things horrible about them are their bad plots, worse acting, and over-reliance on visual effects.  For every classic ""John Carpenter's The Thing"", there's a dozen grating ""Friday the 13th"" type splatter-fests.  However, ""Session 9"" belongs in the rare category of a horror movie that does justice to its genre.

The story is simple: A privately-owned HAZMAT company is tasked with cleaning up a deserted insane asylum.  The boss agrees to the contract under desperate financial circumstances, and it's one more burden on his already fragile psyche.  Soon, the facility's oppressive atmosphere begins to affect the team, and terrible events occur.

I don't want to reveal too many specifics, since ignorance is a plus when viewing ""Session 9.""  A movie has to be something special to push my primal emotional buttons, and this one does it in spades.  As I watched the story unfold, a creeping sense of dread began to grow within me, for a couple of reasons.  First, I cared about the characters enough to hope (and fear) for their safety.  That's a credit to the actors' fine performances within a well-crafted plot.  Second, laughable CGI monsters or other such cinematic cop-outs aren't on hand to provoke cheap thrills.  The use of sound and lighting to create an oppressive atmosphere of impending doom are masterful.  I often felt unsettled by the asylum itself, a real-life abandoned facility that was a character in its own right.  Finally, details are used to great effect, if one looks out for them.  For example, a number of ordinary snapshots figure into the plot.  But in the context of their viewing, the over-lit subjects, surrounded by a clutching darkness, add to the overall malevolence and despair of the proceedings.  Whoever directed ""Session 9"" knows how to work a person's imagination, and for that he's to be commended.

A previous reviewer slammed ""Session 9"" as just another ""possession"" flick.  I don't agree.  Yes, such an assumption could be made based on the titular psychiatric session tapes, along with the shocking, brutal climax.  But the evil a murderous character manifests can just as well be the depraved side of human nature.  Somehow that's scarier than an overt supernatural threat.  Add the unnerving use of voice effects that made me imagine events more terrible than if they were shown, and I was freaked out enough to hope for daylight. As a result, I've avoided a repeat viewing of ""Session 9.""  It's almost too real for comfort.

If you want a fluff ""horror"" movie for fun and a couple of amusement-ride scares, then go get the ""Scream"" trilogy or its ilk.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But if you're looking for true horror, something that will make you turn on the lights and find a friend for comfort, then ""Session 9"" will do.  However, you may discover that it does its job a bit too well.  ""Session 9"" is a thinking person's horror movie.  Just make sure you avoid thinking about it in the dark.",1094083200,6,3005,4.879446640316205

Anybody who actually understood this plot had to have been either high or completely out of their mind.  I had high expectations for this movie but it is cinematic garbage that should be burned for the betterment of Hollywood.  Just when you think the movie has absolutely no point, it ends the way it started...horribly.  The main character turns out to be possessed by one of the multiple personalities that one of the previous inmates of the asylum possessed.  The ending possesses many implications towards society in that it is stated that this evil personality haunts all of us...Oh no!  I will never sleep again.

Take a deep breath to follow the cameras moving along, into the deep long corridors and many more rooms at far lonely end with barely lights in. I admitted it wasn't all that bad at the beginning.
Not until those misguided sub plots getting in, purposed to kill time obviously. Otherwise, the audience'd keep counting how much time left. e.g. in the middle of the story those coins, rings, eyeballs & then those dropped old coins again makes me going mad, ideas like counting days from Mon, Tue, Wed isn't a good idea particularly for already a  loosen structure. It wouldn't help those audiences already felt asleep. Many more plots like old patient Mary/ her graveyard broken pieces/ her room no./ old photos etc...which mean they are all actually being no big deals at the end??? Truly big disappointment.
This isn't a deep pyschological shocking, frightening piece of drama like ""The Shining"", ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Fog"". While it gives you rarely thrilling but only a bit at the end of around 5 minutes, it's getting similar as finish watching ""Identity"" that also finally rushes to an very uncompromising & unsatisfying ending.",1085184000,3,1375,4.922413793103448

The movie starts out asbestos cleaning crew that wins the bid for an abandoned insane asylum.  What should be a straightforward job, is complicated by the personal histories of the crew. In particular, Hank is dating Phil's old girlfriend, and Gordon's new baby seems to be unnerving him more than should be expected. Things get more complicated as wanna be lawyer Mike plays the tapes from a former patient with multiple personalities, including the mysterious Simon who does not appear until Session 9, and as Hank disappears after finding some old coins.

Quite obviously to anyone who experiences the film with their eyes and ears, the 'session 9' tape is the complete embodiment of the psycholoogical theme of the film. It's the recorded session where the personification of the patient's potential repressed capability for evil finally manifests - the trait of humanity that the voice describes as living in 'the weak and the wounded'. So there's  a huge and blindingly obvious parallel between the patient's final session, and Gordon - even to the extent that the final tape plays out as we begin to uncover the truth about him. And as for 'confusing sub-plots', what sub plots? Is someone really complaining about a subplot about a vagrant woman that was REMOVED in it's entirity from the film by the director because he felt it didn't work? Erm... what? Incidently, these scenes are available as extras along side a nice documentary and a superb commentary from some great filmmakers. The film expertly straddles the line between psychological and supernatural horror intermingling the two with creepy and disturbing expertese. It's superb, a great story that is brilliantly performed, and directed. If you're not afraid to engage your brain, give it a watch!",1082937600,,1424,5.008438818565401
1666898,5,B00005UQ9F,"I had never heard of ""Session 9"" until a couple of weeks ago. Ever since I saw it, I can talk of nothing else. It's absolutely AMAZING, and it's sad that it's so overlooked. ""Session 9"" is like no other horror movie I've ever seen and leaves the viewer absolutely dumbfounded. If nothing else, it'll make you more afraid of the dark than you ever were before.
It's nearly impossible to summarize the plot without giving away the entire film, but I'll do my best. The setup: a crew is preparing an abandoned mental hospital for construction. Gordon, the leader of the crew, has held his position for a long time, and thinks that the stress is beginning to get to him. Then the strange things start to happen. One member of the crew discovers a room filled with psycologist's session tapes of the various patients. He starts listening to the sessions of a schizophrenic girl named Mary, who has three personalities: The Princess, Billy, and the eluisve Simon, who we don't hear from until the very end of the film. Another crew member goes missing, and Phil, Gordon's second in command, starts becoming wary of his superior's behavior, and maybe even gets a little power-hungry when he realizes that Gordon might not last too much longer. After a strange discovery, things begin to spiral out of control, leading to a completely unexpected ending.
""Session 9"" is one of the most unpredictable horror films I've ever seen, which is a rarity in today's films like ""Gothika"" and ""The Ring"" which, while artsy, most people had figured out a quarter of the way into the movie. Everything is shot very cleanly and artfully and never sacrifices explanations for aesthetics. The soundtrack is very minimal, just a few well-placed ""pings"" of piano keys, as well as the occasional weird sound effect.
Every horror buff should see this movie. It's one of those rare beauties that sparks lengthy and entertaining discussions afterwards. Oh, one more word of warning: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE BY YOURSELF. Doing so would make it terrifying beyond belief. Enjoy.",1082764800,2,2045,4.829059829059829
1666899,4,B00005UQ9F,"The Danvers Mental Hospital is a REAL, honest-to-goodness asylum in Massachusetts that pioneered and perfected the frontal lobotomy. Built in the 1850's and closed in the mid-1980's due to lack of state funding, this movie is filmed entirely(camcorder style)in the once crowded (with over 2500 patients) & still to this day, horribly sinister asylum. I must say, that the undisputed STAR OF THIS FILM is the ASYLUM, itself. The cast does a better than average job in delivering real characters, however...
A group of Hazmat workers are hired to accomplish the task of asbestos removal in the gargantuan hospital. Gordon, the crew boss, promises that the job will be finished in 7 days.  Each crew member will receive 10 LARGE as a bonus once they meet the deadline, which, no matter how many eerie, odd & unexplained things start to happen in the asylum and to the workers, the promise of the money keeps them all to their appointed task.
This movie is filmed very effectively a la Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" style.  That is to say, each day of the week is stated, a shot of the asylum is shown & then the day is filmed.  This is a frequently used tactic that screenwriters/directors use to build a sense of foreboding, and BOY, DOES IT EVER WORK in this film. Great cinematography & a really frighteningly strange musical score help to build the sense of inducing madness that this film makes you feel. It also has borrowings of ""The Sixth Sense"" inasmuch, clues are given throughout the film so that you may figure out for yourself, (if you are paying close attention) what oddities and malevolent forces are at work in the asylum & in the plot.  You will experience what REALLY ""Lives in the Weak and Wounded...""  I guarantee it!
If you liked the plot twists in Sixth Sense, the madness of The Shining, or the otherworldly spirits that inhabited Stir Of Echos,  you will enjoy Session 9!",1079913600,81,1895,4.7272727272727275

1666901,4,B00005UQ9F,Session 9 was an intense relentlessly terrifying film. The movie takes place in an abandonded insane Asylum. Four workers take on the project of restoring the place before a one week dead line. Many of the men working on the project desperately need the money making this job stressful and tiring. During the film the viewer begins to question the sanity of two of the characters in the film. We don't find out until the end if the old institution is causing psychological problems in the men are if one of the men are simply crazy to begin with. The film is shot with a different kind of film(Not like most films are shot these days) I don't now the technical term for it but its almost has a high quality handheld camera feeling. The music in the movie is really creepy and helps make some of the scene's scare factor go up. Though most of the film relies on mostly pychological terror there is some gore towards the end. The movie was well acted and the characters were believable. In short this is a good movie with some scenes that are very terrifing and disturbing with a ending that is both surprising and frightning.

Ultimately, it's a Macguffin, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie.  It's extremely slow paced and by the time something happens, it's hopelessly underdone.  I can't fault the actors; they did their best with this stinker script.  Peter Mullan, Josh Lucas and even David Caruso do their best, but it's a sinking ship me lads.
As for the ""deleted scenes,"" who in the heck was this old lady running around?  Can see why these scenes were deleted.  Maybe the whole script should have been deleted and redone.

Fifteen years ago, the Psychiatric Hospital on the hill was closed and 2400 patients transferred or let loose.  Now it is time to clean up the building, and Gordon Fleming barely manages to get the bid, promising almost impossibly quick results in order to save his business.
Gordon and his friend Phil hire extra men to get the job done, including Hank, who is dating Phil's ex-girlfriend and does not mince words with Phil about it.  Our crew is filled in with Bill and Jeff, who is Gordon's young nephew.
The old buildings are now graffiti ridden, dangerous with water damage and heavy with asbestos.  During their original tour, Gordon hears a voice speaking to him from down the hallway of ward C, the ward reserved for the most dangerous of patients.
Delving immediately into the huge project, we catch glimpses of each character and see their responses to the eerie environment of their job.  Bill runs across some old tapes of a long dead female patient, labeled Sessions 1-9, and begins listening to them.  She had multiple personalities, and the more Bill listens, the more disturbed he becomes.
Hank finds a treasure in the wall that enclosed the old crematorium, and abruptly leaves both his job and his girlfriend to go to a casino school in Florida, but young Jeff finds him stalking the grounds of the asylum, and after that things get really weird.
Without revealing anything further about the movie, let me tell you what I liked and disliked about it.
What I liked was the spectacular scenery, stunningly beautiful footage of the old hospital, and deeply sinister shots of its rotting interior.  Location was used to astounding effect, providing one of the chilliest atmospheres I have ever seen.  Add to that some eerie tunnels with only flashlights for lighting, sunlight streaming hazily through dirty windows, amazing cinematography utilizing the shoot scene to its fullest.  Not to mention a creepy storyline of bad things happening in a bad place, and stellar acting by David Caruso and supporting cast.
What I didn't like was that the development was too slow for true terror to strike me, there was too much filler dialogue and too many scenes with nothing important happening.  The movie could have been tightened down quite a bit without loosing the magnificent photogenic effects, almost as if not quite enough film hit the editing floor.  With 100 minutes not being a long movie, this particular story might have been a better effort at 90 minutes, cutting the dribble here and there that left me starving for the tastier parts.
It's possible that I'm just too jaded for this type of experiment, but I failed to feel any real threat...no tantalizing shiver for my safety and well-being.  Too loosely does the movie travel until we finally see any form of evil, and in that I found it to be a bit fatiguing instead of intriguing.
Still, its chilling atmosphere makes up a great deal for the drudgery, and you will want to stick around and find out what Simon has to say.  Enjoy!",1073692800,2,3074,4.790170132325142
1666904,3,B00005UQ9F,"The 2001 psychological thriller ""Session 9"" is, quite simply, a character study. This small, independent film generated a nice buzz and it's not difficult to see why many enjoy its creepy allure. ""Session 9"" is certainly not a horror classic, but it's not a bad film either. An unusual atmosphere and a handful of terrific performances boost this little chiller, but a muddled screenplay and a predictable ending place this in the realm of an above average ""Night Gallery"" episode.
A motley cleanup crew is hired to remove asbestos from a huge, abandonded asylum - an extraordinarily creepy building with dark tunnels, eerie metal tables and barred rooms decorated with the unsettling graffiti of past patients. The crew arrives, among them David Caruso, Peter Mullan and Josh Lucas, and each is carrying their own load of mental baggage. From failed relationships to domestic abuse, these men are haunted by the stress of messy lives. Mixed with the rigors of the job and the growing menace of the weird location, they begin to crack in small, uncomfortable ways.
I like the performances of Caruso and Mullan, two excellent actors. As longtime comrades, their characters eventually begin to distrust one another, and group stability collapses. Caruso should be applauded for continuing to do interesting work in small films such as this. For the most part, he's survived the ""NYPD Blue"" blunder, and his work in ""Session 9"" is earnest.
The location work of ""Session 9"" is incredible. Reportedly filmed at an abandonded hospital in Maryland, the set itself is so realistic that it could only be an actual site. It's too bad the filmmakers didn't have the screenplay to back it up. Hazy and frustrating, the story stumbles along while utilizing confusing flashbacks and a hidden tape of a patient with split personalities.
I suppose comparisons to ""The Blair Witch Project"" (isolated people cracking under the pressure) and ""The Shining"" (isolated people in a creepy building) are accurate. But ""Session 9"" is not as good as either one of those films. I respect director Brad Anderson for essentially carting a handful of actors to a remote spot and creating a well-acted little chiller. Undoubtedly the locale is unforgettable, but the film is disappointingly predictable.",1072828800,2,2272,5.110215053763441

1666907,4,B00005UQ9F,"Session 9 is an example of a horror thriller. It has little in common with horror films like Jeepers Creepers where buckets of gore are used in place of imagination. Director Brad Anderson and his outstanding ensemble cast create a tension filled movie that has more in common with Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now  and Kubrick's The Shining than most contemporary horror thrillers. Perhaps that's the difference--this is a thriller not really a horror film. Although the film was shot on high definition 24 frame per second digital video, it's almost impossible to spot the difference on this DVD between that and film.
The Danvers Mental Hospital has been vacant since 1985. A 5 man crew from Hazman Elimination Company has made a low bid to clean out the place of asbestos tile and old insulation. In a bid to make their 1 week completion date, the owner of the company has arranged for a $10,000 bonus to be paid to all the crew if they can finish it within 7 days. Since it's really a two week job, these guys have their work cut out for them. It doesn't help that old ghosts loom large in the background and disturb their work. What they don't know can hurt them; evidently a multiple personality patient by the name of Mary was housed there. One of the reasons why the place was closed down was because of accusations from the doctors on staff and legal action they took. Budget cuts and a losing court case closed the sprawling Victorian style building down.
Led by a strong ensemble cast featuring David Caruso (CSI:Miami, NYPD Blue) and Josh Lucas (The Hulk, Sweet Home Alabama), Session 9 is an excellent example of what imagination and skill can accomplish without buckets of gore. The film isn't without flaws. The plotting becomes a bit lazy towards the conclusion but, on the whole, the film is an outstanding effort. Anderson does an excellent job in building considerable tension throughout the picture and the strong cast (actor Stephen Gevedon co-wrote the script with Anderson) only increases the tension and level of conflict between the characters.
The extras include an alternate ending, (which featured a dropped subplot that didn't quite mesh with the film) and deleted scenes. There's also an interesting commentary by the director (the film was actually shot at an old Mental Hospital so Anderson's comments are really interesting) as well as the theatrical trailer and a featurette on the mental hospital entitled The Haunted Palace. Never gruesome but always suspenseful, Session 9 is a great way to spend a chilly, rainy evening on a Friday night. Be warned, though that there is some bad langauge in the film so it isn't suitable for preteens.",1071273600,5,2672,4.834061135371179

The asylum is like a living entity all of its own adding to the already horrific circumstances. The place just keeps getting creepier and creepier.

Henry (Josh Lucas) discovers hidden treasure in the tunnels beneath the asylum.  Jeff (Brendon Sexton III) struggles with his fear of the dark.  Phil (David Caruso) tries to keep the crew working as a team.  The team leader, Gordon (Peter Mullan), longs to return to his wife and child.
As the team begins to work, the eerie building begins to work on them.
This is a surprising thriller.  It doesn't rely on special effects to creep out the viewers.  It's all done with lighting, with story, and the use of a video camera instead of a big, bulky movie camera.  You feel that you're right there with the team, working in that immense building.  (A good example is when Henry is walking back alone from the tunnels, up a staircase that is divided by a gate for staff on one side and patients on the other.  The camera work and editing make this a genuinely creepy scene.)  When the team is told some of the sordid history of the asylum, that lends to the fear that both the actors and the viewers sense.
All the actors give fine performances.  That, coupled with a great script and great directing, make for one of the scarier thrillers to be made in a long time.
The DVD picture and sound quality are fantastic.

I had to watch this movie about three times to really go back and see all the subtle connections, but it was worth it.  The guy who plays Mike also helped to write the script.  This movie is very believable which makes it even more scary.  There are no monsters or aliens, just the monsters inside each and every one of us who are just waiting for the right time to be set free.
This movie is also very good because it doesn't have to rely on blockbuster actors (actually, David Caruso is the only actor that I knew, but all of the actors did a fine job) and million dollar special effects.  This movie is too smart for that.

I have always felt the truly scariest of movies, are the ones that leave a lot up to the viewers imagination. It's most often what you DON'T see that ends up being the most frightening .
This movie tells the story of a group of 4 men, hired to remove hazordous material from an abandoned insane asylum. Each of these men have their own reasons for being there, and the first half of ""Session 9"" goes about explaining what they are, through various subtle and not so subtle clues. There's the failed lawyer who becomes obsessed with listening to old tapes of therapy sessions with a woman named Mary and her 3 alter-personalities. Then there is the lottery-ticket obsessed Hank who thinks he's found his ""escape plan"" buried deep inside the tunnels of the asylum. David Caruso's character is hard-working, but you can't help but think he's hiding his own secrets. Gordon...the leader of the group is the hardest character to figure out. You are shown flashbacks that make you suspect that something horrible has happened in his life recently, but you're not sure exactly what until very near the end.
The plot is a bit slow-moving at first, but it succeeds in drawing you in, and making you want to know what exactly is driving these characters. and there is the asylum. The aspect of the film that disburbed me more then anything else...without giving too much away...is what ends up happening to the Hank character. The scenes of him running down the shadow-filled tunnels, and subsequent re-emergence of his character later in the film left me feeling incredibly uneasy. that is the one thing that will end up staying with me more then anything else.

Bear in mind that this means I consider ""Session 9"" to be a very effective, skillfully-made movie; perhaps one of the best horror films (in the classic sense) I've seen in some time. Far more genuinely frightening than ""The Ring"" or ""The Blair Witch Project,"" while avoiding the ""hipness"" of the Scream series or ""Jeepers Creepers,"" ""Session 9"" is filled with everything any real fan of horror movies can't help but appreciate. To be honest, I haven't been this creeped out while watching a movie since I saw ""Jacob's Ladder"" for the first time, and even that film (though fascinating) didn't disturb me on the level that ""Session 9"" did.
The medium of film makes the telling of a horror story particularly difficult, as a careful filmmaker has to decide just what to show, and when. A good horror writer knows when the best moment to show the monster is... or if to show it at all. In film, this becomes even more of a problem, as it is a medium based largely on visuals. Not showing the Monster to the audience can either enhance suspense or increase frustration, depending on how its handled, but once the monster is seen it is almost always a disappointment. A film like ""The Haunting"" (the original version, mind you, not the recent remake) succeeds because it maintains suspense through sound and great cinematography, despite the fact that we never see what's making all the noise, while the aforementioned ""Jacob's Ladder"" works so well because while we are given glimpses of frightening things and creatures, they are never shown clearly. What we come away with is flashes of frightening imagery, leaving plenty of room for an active imagination to fill in the gaps. As Alfred Hitchcock put it, ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.""
""Session 9"" is almost nothing but anticipation, but it is masterfully handled and never becomes frustrating. From the first minutes of the film to the very end, the viewer is never sure what to expect, and often expects the worst. In a particularly good segment, near the end of the film, several points of view on the story are advancing all at once, independent of one another but intersecting at key events. The level of suspense maintained in this sequence is nothing short of intense, and yet it is done while showing very little graphically. In fact, we don't find out what actually happened in that sequence until several minutes later, and even then the answers come with only subtle visuals. Like an Edgar Allen Poe story, the entire purpose of ""Session 9"" seems to be to establish and maintain a level of fear and uncertainty in the viewer, keeping them guessing until the very end. And this it does, with surprising subtlety.
Perhaps one of the most important elements of a good horror movie for me is effective use of imagery, a task which ""Session 9"" accomplishes easily. This goes back to the earlier point about subtlety and anticipation. There are a number of scenes in ""Session 9"" which make excellent use of imagery to this end. A shot of a narrow hallway, for example, lit along its length by several bare lightbulbs. A young man is running through this hallway, and lights are going out rapidly behind him. The darkness overtakes and engulfs the young man in a matter of a couple seconds. What makes this shot especially effective is that we already know that he is afraid of the dark. The ""signature"" shot of the film, a beat-up wheelchair caught in a ray of sun at the end of a decrepit hallway, sets the mood early on in the film quite effectively. Other details, such as a shape moving in darkness, or a bloody handprint smeared on a door, or the plastic sheeting covering the walls in the old asylum, are all handled well. ""Session 9"" is a movie of exceptional detail in its imagery.
Another important element to good horror movies is sound. Perhaps even moreso than imagery, sound can convey fear and anticipation quite effectively if used correctly. In ""Session 9,"" there are a number of uses of sound that are notable. In the old asylum, particularly, there are noises throughout the film. It drips, it scrapes, it creaks, it echoes. The asylum seems almost to have a life of its own, with all of the strange sounds it makes. And the taped recordings, from which ""Session 9"" gets it name, have a subtle yet creepy warble in them, in which the voices are periodically warped. It's a small thing that added to the overall effect, but then most effective elements of filmmaking are small things. While watching this film, it's just as important to listen as it is to look.
The devil is in the details, and in ""Session 9,"" all the skillful details add up to a devilish movie indeed. The film makes no compunction about being simply a scary movie, one which is intended to unnerve its audience, and by the time it is over it has accomplished this goal admirably. Its ending touches on a subject which disturbs me pretty deeply, which is the reason I'll likely never watch it again. However, the way I see it, that is merely another testament to the fact that it remains a deeply effective horror film, in that it got under my skin so completely. Not many movies can do that, and those that do are worthy of attention.",1064448000,6,5394,4.624608967674661
1666924,5,B00005UQ9F,"This is the best psychological thriller I've seen in a long time.  It's absolutely brilliant. Its subtle horror eerily creeps up on you as the film progresses.  The ending is shocking and keeps you momentarily spellbound as you rewind the movie through your mind, in order to try to capture the scenes and signs that led to the disturbing finish.
This movie's creepiness stems from the fact that it has a very believable quality to it.  Yes, the asylum is a real place in MA, the characters have a purpose for hanging out at the asylum(cleaning out the asbestos), and the revelations of the characters' lives unfold in a way that's realistic and ties the unexpected ending together.
The film's pace is deliberate, which some people may find too slow and confusing, but the reason behind it is to develop the plot and build the connections.  It all comes together, so be patient!
This is not your typical scary movie and that's what makes it so much better.",1062806400,3,956,4.6726190476190474
1666925,5,B00005UQ9F,"I read one of the other reviews on this site, specifically the one that feels Session 9 sets back any realistic and modern view of the mentally disturbed.  I have to disagree with it completely.  Never at any time did I find myself left with the impression that ""THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!!  FEAR THE MENTALLY DISTURBED!!!""  What I did get was, that sometimes, the bottom falls out of your life and how far you fall is the true depth of horror.
Mood and setting in this film are simply excellent.  I've seen comparisons to Blair Witch, but honestly BW had 5 good minutes of footage and a lot of unneeded dialouge.  Session 9 does not.  It is a slowly crafted masterpiece that evolves over the course of the film and takes you to some pretty dark places.  Honestly, I can't recommend this movie highly enough if you like your horror of the suspense variety and don't need buckets of gore to creep you out.",1058486400,,903,4.430303030303031
1666926,5,B00005UQ9F,"""Session 9"" is one of the most terrifying, disturbing, and haunting haunted house movies ever made. If you're looking for a horror film that truly gets down under your skin and really disturbs, this is the movie that's going to deliver the goods. Watch the first 10 minutes of the movie, and you're already glancing around at noises in the darkness, wondering if maybe, just maybe, you might want to turn a light on.
Just to see your popcorn, of course. Yes, I'm telling you---'Session 9' is that good.
Of course, the movie will always be close to my heart, for two reasons:
1) I was invited to attend a screening of the rough cut of the film; not knowing that the movie had been filmed at the Danvers State Hospital, I demurred. In one sense, I'm glad I did: seeing the finished product, shot beautifully in digital video, with no spoilers and no idea what I should expect, was far better.
2) The movie, as I mentioned, is filmed in and around the now de-commissioned Danvers State Hospital, about 20 miles north of Boston. Danvers, as locals referred to it, was the infamous state insane asylum, and is a wonderfully creepy, amazingly powerful location to shoot a horror film.
Back in 2001 I planned a day trip from New York up to Danvers, originally intending to spend the night in Danvers town and spend a few days exploring the asylum. I was fascinated by its dark history, and more importantly by the crenellated battlements and dragonlike exterior of what had been a model ""McBride"" institution, built originally as the state-of-the-art in 19th century psychotheraphy. Its vast, Victorian rooms were proportioned with plenty of space and designed to let in light, and the central refectory, where inmates dined communally, had a loft where a chamber orchestra played music. Music, of course, to soothe the savage soul.
Overcrowding in the early 20th century perverted Danver's original mission, and by the 1960's the place was a snakepit, with non-violent inmates thrown together with the worst of the criminally insane; it was closed for good in 1991 and stands empty on its high, lonely hill today.
It is now, to my mind, as it is to director Brad Anderson and screenwriter Stephen Gevedon, a place of darkness; if you accept that there are haunted places on Earth, then Danvers is assuredly the king of them. When I first arrived in front of the asylum---and I am a hardheaded realist, with no patience for superstition---I felt watched, leered at by countless eyes who wished me gone, wished my destruction. Anderson and Gevedon have captured that oppression perfectly in ""Session 9"", a little too perfectly.
With that in mind, ""Session 9"" is about a haunted, tortured place that begins to infect the minds and bodies of a hazardous materials team sent to clean out the building's massive asbestos contamination. The team, headed up by the anxious but domineering Gordon Fleming (played taciturnly and perfectly by Peter Mullan), narrowly won the bid to clean the facility, a bid critical to the company, and Fleming's, future.
But there's a slight complication: to get the bid, Gordon promised to do the job in two weeks, a feat that may prove impossible, with dire consequences for Gordon's company. Adding to problem is the team itself, who have their own secrets and problems. Under the pressure of the looming deadline, and in the shadow of Danver's turrets and the darkness of its halls, the men begin to fall under the spooky, unnerving influence of the old asylum, particularly when one of them discovers a set of psychiatric interview tapes of a long-dead female patient, carefully stored away and labelled ""Sessions 1-9"".
To say more would be unfair to the viewer: ""Session 9"" is a perfect little gem of a horror movie with its own deep black secrets. The acting is all excellent, particularly Mullan's portrayal of a man on the edge, and David Caruso is outstanding as the team foreman, his nervous face twitching with carefully constrained emotion.
But by far the best actor in ""Session 9"" is the gloomy old Danvers insane asylum, which acts as a character in its own right. It would be hard to think of a set, however cleverly crafted, that would have worked as well as the ruined asylum, whose degenerate Victorian beauty figures prominently in every scene; particularly good is the way the still stoic, sturdy red-brick Moorish exterior contrasts with the rotting, molting, peeling guts of the asylum, and cinematographer Uta Brieswitz pushes the digital video envelope in capturing the stinking center of this heart of darkness.
""Session 9"" is not an obvious movie; it is like getting a kiss on the nape of the neck in a graveyard. It is a movie of subtle but overwhelming terror, a terror that mounts throughout the film, but one that hides; this is not a film about slashers or zombies or vampires or monsters, but the horror that lurks in forgotten, forsaken places. It is about a hungry house, a forgotten temple of sacrificed souls that still wants to eat.",1057881600,16,4988,4.828271028037383
1666927,3,B00005UQ9F,"Here's a film to put back community attitudes towards mental illness by a hundred years. Actually, it's positively medieval. Cast and crew in the special features go out of their way to express how 'creeped out' they were by the asylum, Mallen even going as far to suggest he was haunted by voices. All this furthers the distasteful equation the film pushes that mental illness=evil. 'They' cannot be trusted to walk amongst you because they will KILL YOU, your WORKMATES and even their OWN FAMILIES! It's as nastily exploitative a message as 'Black Christmas'. Still, those of you who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing that you will like. It has a squirm inducing ending up (or down?) there with the eye gouging scene in '28 Days Later'. In fairness, the film manages to induce a sense of dread about three quarters the way through that never lets up. But this is where we came in. Ironically, the director's soporific, monotonous commentary suggests what it might be like to experience a frontal lobotomy.",1057622400,,1024,4.758426966292135
1666928,3,B00005UQ9F,"I was very disappointed with this film.  Though it was well acted, the storyline left alot to be desired.  The movie plodded along with a lot of character development, which is usually a good thing save when it comes at the expense of any sort of real or long lasting suspense.  I often wondered when the thrills would begin, when things would start to pick up, when they would start to explain why I should be interested and scared at what I was seeing.  They never really came.

In movies like this, where the source of thrills is left ambiguous, it can sometimes fall down to whether or not you decide to care.  [SPOILER ALERT] Along the way there are hints of an evil presence, an entity that ""lives in the weak and wounded"" and causes people to hurt others violently.  For instance, does the sudden insanity and inexplicable turn to murder of the main character entail supsense and terror simply because they play scary music and jumpy sound effects at the ""right"" time?  The movie never really decides if the evil entity is the twist, or if its just a story that ups the creepy factor.  In so doing, it was questionable that the movie was really ""Session 9"" and not ""Crazy Waste Eliminators 5.""  Because, if you couldn't guess, without something involved, the story amounts to the life and times of five dudes and their garbage removal hijinks.",1055116800,,1350,4.5875
1666958,5,B00005UQ9F,"It's tremendously spooky and atmospheric. Very disturbing. It's filmed on location at Danvers State Mental Hospital in Danvers, MA. I was just up there a couple weeks back with a friend, but we couldn't get onto the property because we hadn't cleared it yet with the MA Film Commission and the State Police -- we're planning on another outing in June.
The film is very simple. It's about five Hazmat guys who go in to remove asbestos with a one week time limit (or they lose their big bonus). While there, odd things start happening, they start acting differently, one of them stumbles upon some old reel-to-reel tapes in a deserted storage room. They are recordings of psychiatric sessions between a doctor and a woman who harbors a terrible secret buried beneath layers of multiple personalities.
The setting is downright creepy. The hospital itself seems alive, like a character all its own. This movie is successful in bringing to the screen something THE HAUNTING (remake of the Shirley Jackson novel inspired film) and Stephen King's ROSE RED failed to do -- it proved that some ""houses"" are just ""born bad.""
Watching this film reminded me of some of the images I'd seen personally when doing a little ""investigation"" of the old Connecticut Valley Hospital a few years back, and of stories my Mom had told me earlier about her investigations of the place -- she was actually able to get a worker to give her a tour of the subterranean tunnels and ""cells"" where they housed the more ""disturbed"" patients -- the violent psychotics, the criminally insane. It's full of dark passages, cramped areas (claustrophobes will go nuts! ;)
It's not your typical modern horror film. It's mostly psychological. The director compares it to films like THE SHINING and DON'T LOOK NOW (and even THE EXORCIST).
Give it a look. Solid acting from David Caruso, Steven Gevedon and others make the characters real. A tight script with an emphasis on dialogue keeps them alive (for awhile anyway ;) No flashy special effects means the scares come from other places ;) All in all, a fine horror flick that will satisfy fans of atmospheric and psychiatric horror. Fans of only the teeny bopper pseudo slasher films like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SCREAM will find it mostly boring and too difficult to follow ;)",1054425600,,2300,4.8106060606060606
1666959,3,B00005UQ9F,"SESSION 9

(USA - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (HD Widescreen)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Five professional contractors - each with their own personal problems - are hired to strip asbestos from a huge, abandoned asylum where the horrific events of the past intrude on the present, invoking a murderous confrontation.

Notable as the first movie shot in the scope format using high-definition video at 24fps (transferred to 35mm film for theatrical screenings) - the same process used by George Lucas for STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES the following year - director Brad Anderson describes SESSION 9 as an exercise in 'creeping dread', filmed at the deserted Danvers Mental Institution in Massachusetts whose crumbling interior suggests nothing less than the hellish Marsten House of Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot'. As the audio commentary on the original US DVD attests, Anderson takes his visual cue from slow-burning thrillers like THE SHINING and DON'T LOOK NOW, favoring long, deliberate camera movements and wide-angle shots which transform the Institute's vast, empty spaces into an oppressive, tomb-like structure. Few Hollywood movies of recent years have used the scope format to such impressive effect.

A terrific ensemble cast is headlined by David Caruso (TV's ""CSI: Miami"") and Scottish actor-director Peter Mullan (MY NAME IS JOE), both of whom give committed performances as men on the edge of despair, and strong support is given by Josh Lucas (THE DEEP END), Brendan Sexton III (WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE) and co-writer Steven Gevedon as the hapless co-worker who stumbles on a series of audio tapes which contain ultra-creepy psychiatric sessions involving a former patient suffering from split personality disorder.

Memorable sequences include Lucas' unscheduled late-night visit to the Institute, where he finds himself sharing the darkness with... something that shouldn't be there, and the inevitable moment when Sexton - who had earlier declared his morbid fear of the dark - finds himself trapped in the bowels of the building just as the lights begin to go out... Two endings were filmed, one of which involves a subplot that was ultimately dropped from the final assembly, but in truth, neither one of them lives up to expectations. The combination of tragedy and horror will still take many viewers by surprise, but one is left with the distinct impression that few of the participants were interested in making a REAL horror film, even if the movie ends up being one anyway, in spite of itself. Beautifully judged for the most part, and genuinely frightening in places, SESSION 9 is worth a look, despite minor reservations.",1054080000,2,2674,5.265258215962441

The movie is also well presented with awesome actors such as David Caruso and Josh Lucas. All the actors put on such a great performance and I highly recomend this movie for anyone who wants a great thrill.

 It did have potential, and there are some scenes that might make one jump, but overall , it's weak.
 I found the acting to be poor as well. David Caruso, honestly, can anyone take him seriously? What a joke!
 If you are looking for a cerebral horror movie , this is not it. If you enjoyed ""Darkness Falls"" or recently graduated from eighth grade or listen to Nu metal, you'll relish this gem.

The characters are not your standard guys labeled Bad or Good, but just a bunch of normal people. This fact alone makes this move special from most other [bad] ""scary"" movies.
You also need to do some thinking to appreciate this one, it won't tell you everything straight out. I guess people who enjoys the common hack n slash horror flicks won't enjoy this one much.

1666966,5,B00005UQ9F,"Session 9 is a smart, dark, chilling feature compared to the otherwise torturous banality found in most horror/thriller films.
To begin, it has a unique plot line; it's a film about an asbestos clean-up crew hired to remove the substance from an abandoned asylum. That is cool enough to get my attention. How many films have you seen about asbestos workers? But it gets better...
The crew has it's various characters, all a bit extreme in one way or another: the mid-life crisis, the dense teenager, the jealous ex-boyfriend...and a few others. These characters set up the tension of the film at the start. You can see they each have some form of conflict and anguish going on in their lives at the start. Which causes them to be a little bit on edge. On top of that, they have to work around this intensely hazardous material on a daily basis. And still further, their current hire is to work in the creepiest place you can think of. The abandoned insane aysylum. It only gets creepier from there.
It's full of surprises,and INCREDIBLE cinematogrpahy. It' just a pleasure to absorb using all your senses.
The actual location was an old insane asylum. No sets were used. And that is half of what makes the movie as great as it is. If you are fortunate enough to watch the DVD version with all the extras such as commentary, and featurettes, you will learn that the actual location had a serious effect on the actors while they were there. The more you listen to their actual experiences the more the film takes on a new light and may very well make you watch it again with a different perspective. You begin to realise that a lot of the actors didn't have to do much ""acting"" when they were supposed to be frightened in their scenes and that has such an amazing effect on the film. I found it to be so much more entertaining to watch a film where the actors were just as creeped out as the audience. That gave it a realism most films will never have.

This movie had a good idea and concept, but it didn't try hard enough. I don't get where the Blair Witch comparison comes in...maybe it was a marketing scheme.
All in all, a general waste of time. When the closing credits started to roll, I yearned to have the previous hour and a half of my life back.",1046044800,4,560,4.242990654205608
1666968,5,B00005UQ9F,"I think many people giving this movie a bad review didn't understand the concept of it. The TRUE horror of this film is what can happen to a person when things in their life start to go bad. The setting takes place in real-life abandoned insane asylum, and the director makes good use of dark corners and shadows, giving the film a VERY creepy feel. The acting is above average for an indie film and it is well scripted. The story starts out slow as you learn about each of the five main characters in the film. As the film progresses, you're given subtle clues about the life of the lead character, Gordon. There is a sub-plot that eventually ties the lead character to a person that was once a patient at the asylum. The ending of Session 9 is a little confusing at first, and makes you really think hard about what happened when it's all said and done. The ending of the film will definitely send chills up your spine!
Overall this movie is one of the best psychological horror films ever made. The abandoned insane asylum is merely used as the sixth character, scaring you as you learn about its dark past throughout the film. This movie is not about ghosts floating around the insane asylum (although they MAY exist), but rather our own personal demons that can, at some point, take over our lives without us ever knowing. The setting just makes the film that much creepier because of the terrible things that went on in there. I highly recommend this DVD to any horror movie fan that is looking for something completely different, and that will leave them thinking about it long after they're done watching it.

Session 9, with it's characters who exsist in bitter denial of their own natures, is not only a well done movie- but well worth watching again.",1042329600,,457,4.9480519480519485

The story describes the life of one of the mental hospital patients (the mental hospital is abandoned, but there are still records and REEL-To-REEL recordings that our characters find... when snooping around), who has Schizophrenia and the very rare Multiple Personality Disorder.  Well you should see it for yourself; I thought it was truly original!

If you get the DVD, there's some interesting parts about the building that the movie was shot within.

This movie will put you deep into the minds of some mentally unstable people.  People who were very normal once, people who either have weak minds or who have been wounded somehow, people you may even know yourself.....and it may even force you to take a really good look at yourself after this movie is over.  Which is perhaps the scariest thing of all....
The two people this film focuses on are a mental patient from the hospital many years ago, and one of the workers there now trying to clean the place up.  The mental patient's story is told through some taped sessions, found by a worker by chance and listened to by him on his free time to find out what sort of things went on in the hospital.  The worker's story was told in bits and pieces as well, and the viewer really won't know who the insane person is or why he does what he does until the very end.  The 2 stories show how different people in totally different circumstances can end up reaching for help in the same way...and have the same kind of destructive results.  Very creepy stuff.
I must say that this movie seemed fairly boring through most of it the first time I watched it.  But the last 20 minutes were heart-stopping!  Hang in there, and watch it again some time.  I just watched it for the second time, and it was TWICE as creepy, TWICE as heart-pounding, and TWICE as sickening.

The setting, an old, empty insane asylum with its own morgue and cemetary, was creepy as hell; and the premise about a cleanup crew hired to eliminate asbestos tiles and other toxic materials had real potential.  Also, the characters and the acting were above average for a modern horror flick.  For these reasons, I give the movie three stars.
The problem with this movie is, it never quite delivers on what the first few minutes promises you.  This asylum offers a lot of scare potential that the movie doesn't take advantage of.  And I really don't mind a scary movie starting slow, but Session 9 STAYS slow.  It doesn't pick up the pace until the last fifteen minutes or so...and the ending, designed to be a shocking twist, just isn't.
So, bottom line: if you're a hardcore horror fan, check this one out.  It might work better for you than it did for me.  Other movie viewers should probably steer clear.",1035936000,5,991,4.622857142857143

Big mistake.
I went to sleep on edge, feeling really weird, like all the dark shadows contained some sort of...I don't know.
And that's just it: I don't know.
I don't now what the antagonist was in Session 9. I don't know what the point of the movie was. I don't know what to make of the ending. Was it supernatural, like The Shining? Or was it merely psychological, like any guy-under-pressure-kills-people movie?
I don't know.
The asylum was way beyond creepy. It, alone, deserves the three stars I gave this movie. But the plot is weak, and the wrap-up was even weaker. More spookiness could have been wrung out of this movie if the writer/director had utilized the setting more effectly and shown flashbacks to when the asylum was in full use. Or shown ghosts. Or shown things moving in the asylum that weren't human. Or something.
I can't recommend Session 9 -- although I wish I could. It's a great idea. But it was flawed in its execution.",1033862400,2,1068,4.482051282051282
1666996,2,B00005UQ9F,"This movie had potential. Still frames of the Danvers hospital will send a chill up your spine. However, the story just does not create any suspense.
The movie has the typical formula of 95% introduction, 5% climax and ending with no middle section. No gradual building of suspense that keeps you at the edge of your seat.
Nothing related to the story really happens in the first 95% of the movie, and then in the last 5%, a chain of events occurs. The only problem is that most viewers probably know exactly who is behind the chain of events the minute the first event happens. So there is no ""whodunnit"" supspense whatsoever (watch the deleted scenes and director's commentary and you will see this is the type of suspense he was going for). The only suspense is that you are waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen. Then it does and you know exactly who did it and why. It is like watching 3 hours of convenience store surveilence tape in anticipation of a robbery and then the thief walks in, waves to the camera, and takes off his mask.
The setting is awesome, the acting is pretty good, and the characters are likeable... but the story [stinks]!!!
Even though it is a suspense film (which are not believable to begin with, but that is the point), certain things do have to add up to for the film to have any credibility. One huge thing doesn't! Why doesn't Mike just take the tapes home instead wasting the whole work week listening to them, especially when they are trying to get the project done in one week! The movies does a pretty good job of depicting him as a bright, hard-working guy. So why, you ask, would he do something so stupid? Why? Because the sessions are creepy and the director wants to distract you from the fact that nothing is really happening. The result? The whole film seems contrived.

1666997,2,B00005UQ9F,"The creepiest thing about this movie are the images of the asylum itself, however, the director fails to use the creepiness to it's full extent.  Showing eerie rooms in wide angle, and blinding broad daylight hardly adds to the suspense.  Take a few pages out of David Fincher's playbook, and get back to us.
This movie really is just weak.  The acting is awful (Especially the young kid with the mullet), the direction is juvenile, the script is pretty bad, and the casting... well... it's no surprise that David Caruso is the ""big named talent"" for this piece of junk.
The worst part of this movie, is the extra footage, showing an interview with the writer-slash-director, who talks about ""his creation"" like he created the next ""Citizen Kane"".  Talk about being pompous.  This guy needs to get a clue.  He is one inch away from directing ""10-10-321"" commericals (come to think of it, I can safely say, that at least would hold the audience attention more than this steaming pile of clap-trap!)

There are some well-done scares that are not just sudden loud noises but they are deeply unsettling images.

Comparisons to ""The Shining"" are absolutely warranted as ""Session 9"" is more of a mental exercise and slow burn than a Jason/Freddy Krueger-type bloodfest. Like many of the reviewers, I was a bit confused by the end of the movie. However, after re-watching the film with the commentary of director Brad Anderson and co-writer Stephen Gevedon, everything became much clearer and the smallest, seemingly inconsequential details took on more significance. I hesitate recommending this film to everyone simply because many people just ""won't get it,"" sort of like some people just don't get ""Memento."" So that you won't be disappointed (for the wrong reasons- after all you have every right not to like the movie even if you do understand it) with this movie, go into it knowing that:
1. This is not a ghost story. Don't expect ghosts. No ghosts.
2. This movie starts out very slow and continues that way for quite awhile. If you have a short attention span or lack patience, you might want to skip this one.
3. Be open to the idea that mental instability and being trapped in one's own private hell can be far more terrifying than guys walking around with knives for fingers.

I figured it would be ""The House on Haunted Hill"" or ""The Haunting"" which are movies I liked, but were not really scary. ""Session 9"" on the other hand IS quite scary.  I'm not going to bother rehashing the story, but I will say that if you're more into supernatural suspense-thrillers (like ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Others"", Stephen King's ""Storm of the Century"") than slasher flicks, then you'll LOVE this movie.  The suspenseful and hinting scenes build up to a climax that makes sense, but is also very surpising and unexpected.  It's not a gore-fest definitely, and the actual violence is fairly short.  The insane asylum (which is a real place actually) and the tapes one of the characters discover of a former inmates psychological evaluation supply the main creepiness of the film.

1667004,2,B00005UQ9F,"but unfortunately it tried to do be a lot of different things and did them only adequately at best.  The asylum seems almost haunted but not really.  The characters almost flesh themselves out but not really.  The movie started to be a psychological thriller at one point but not really...  You get the point.
One of the biggest hindrances was the music or misuse of it.  The minimalist style used would have worked a lot better if something scary actually happened when the music was building up.  But instead, except for the last 10 minutes of the movie every time the music built up, it would just stop and nothing, climactic or anti-climactic, would happen.  It's like the climax golden twins just decides to play around with an oboe and piano whenever they felt like it, without even watching the movie.
The premise for the movie really was great, but it ended up being a thriller without thrills.  Had the madness started creeping into the characters as the movie progressed; had there been a few false alarms; had some more paranormal stuff happened it really would have been a great movie even with most of the events happening in broad daylight.  But unfortunately the writers started with a great idea and never really took advantage of it.  as far as the actors go, they did the best they could with what they were given.
I really wanted to like this movie, and there were some points were it really shone, but unfortunately those parts couldn't overcome the long streaches of boring scenes that didn't really make sense.

1667015,3,B00005UQ9F,"Session Nine really left me scratching my head.  To be fair, the first time I watched it the conditions were somewhat shy of optimal.  I broke it up over two days and was pulled away during several key sequences by phone calls and babies crying.  To make sure that I gave the film it's proper attention I locked all the doors and watched it through a second time, but was still left with most of the same questions.
To start off, the characters are the basic archetypes that inhabit thrillers such as these.  This being a `working man thriller', the roles do not include one of the most recognizable; the mad (or at least quirky) scientist.  Alien made it without one, so I guess we can survive sans one here.  Present are:
The business owner/corporate guy focused on saving the business/profits and damn the rest of the world. (Except, of course, his family back home usually shown through rain swept windows or in a nice soft focus memory)
The hard working, morally centered second in command who has recently lost the love of his life to...
The lazy bastard everyone loves to hate.
Also present are: The intellectual who doesn't really fit in working with the blue collar guys, but has a secret; and the rookie kid on his first job who we all know will end up dying some horrible way.
The first third of the movie is dedicate to the set up and loaded with the required exposition.  I always find it amazing that security guards and DPW workers can be such a thorough source of back story and vital historical information.  The head of the DPW who contracts our heroes to remove the asbestos from the soon to be remodeled asylum is conveniently married to the local historian; a slightly contrived convenience, but forgivable since the device does allow the story to move along quicker.
Looking back,  I see that most of what I've stated thus far has been pretty harsh, but I did like this flick.  The characters, though broadly sketched, are likeable (well, except for the lazy bastard) and the acting made me forgive most of the weaknesses of the script.  What really pulled me out of the experience, even in the second viewing, was the ""twist"" ending.
The way the clues are laid out as to who the killer is really do point to pretty much any one of the guys working (young guy who you know will die horribly excluded, of course) and a few other folks as well.  What it reminded me of, strangely enough, was a stage play my wife and I saw in Boston several years ago called Shear Madness.  The plot revolves around a murder in a hair salon and at the end the audience actually votes to decide who the killer is.  There are enough `facts' pointing at each cast member that when the detective starts explaining the motives and opportunities we can believe the person we selected is guilty.  Session 9 could easily subject itself to such a gimmick.  (Hmm.  With DVD's branching abilities...)
I don't know if this is supposed to be a puzzle movie, like the Sixth Sense, or a straight on psychological/haunted house horror like The Shining and I'm not convinced that the movie itself knows what it wants to be.  If only the cast weren't so damn likeable it would be easy to pan this flick entirely, but I can't.  David Caruso and company bring such believability and a wonderfully grounded nature to this movie that I really do feel compelled to watch it a third time and really `get' it.  I only hope that there really is something to get.",1028073600,2,3439,4.533980582524272

This asylum was definately a character in the movie.  You could not pay me [enough money] to spend 5 minutes in this place!  The film is quiet successful in creating a real sense of dread and fear.  This is a very unsettling movie.  There are parts that tend to drag and there is a lot of talking, but these parts help to define the characters and later to display a kind of descent into madness for each of the work crew.  The segments of the movie with the tape recorded sessions with the institutionalized patient are intense and terrifying (I hope this was not a real tape of a real session, because that would be TOO scary!)

I'm not sure how much I can say about where the movie went wrong without giving too much away, but I'll try. At the end of the movie it turns out that it wasn't really a psychological thriller at all. Oh, no, no, no. It turns out it was a... * spoiler alert * case of demonic possession. Well, at least it was an excuse to * spoiler alert * kill off most of the main characters.

1667024,3,B00005UQ9F,"While it has some weaknesses, ""Session 9"" manages to deliver some devilishly creepy chills and thrills. The sprawling old Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts, with its grim Victorian facade and general state of disrepair, makes a great setting
One of my favorite character actors, the Scottish Peter Mullan, plays the owner of a small HAZMAT cleanup company. He lands a desperately needed contract to clean up the old hospital and offers his crew a bonus of $10,000 each if they can get the job done in a week's time. The job starts out okay, but soon we see that mental stability is in short supply among these guys. The place may or may not be haunted, but that's almost beside the point. The horror stories they have heard about it, plus its ominous feel, are enough to cause the men to slowly unravel. Soon, horror, either real or imagined, waits around every dark corner.
The movie does a nice job of building tension, although some people will find the pacing too slow for them. For quite awhile, nothing specific happens, but the mood tells us that something dreadful is going to happen. And it does.
The screenplay's main weakness is in its character development. The actors' characters are sketchily written, which makes it hard to get that involved with them. The ending may surprise some. I saw it coming, but this did not ruin it for me, since it seemed like the only logical conclusion.
One element that makes ""Session 9"" a bit different is that it isn't a Doomed Teenager movie. With one exception, it's a Doomed Adult movie. In any case, I think this is one of the better psychological horror thrillers of recent years.",1019088000,10,1638,4.710801393728223

Session 9 is a creepy little nugget directed by Brad Anderson, whom I have never heard of before. The cast itself has only one person i've seen elsewhere, David Caruso. The rest are more unknowns. These factors could work against this film's reputation, which is unfortunate. This is definitely worth adding to one's collection.
This is a basic story about a group of guys working in a big, empty, scary building with the unsettling fact that it was once an institution for the insane. Many tensions build as the job progresses. Our guys are removing hazerdous materials from the building, and they don't have as much time as they normally do. The owner, Gordon, is having financial troubles that weigh heavily on his mind. Gordon's nephew is new and untried, which doesn't help. Two others, Phil and Hank had a woman come between them, and the last, Mike, is working hazmat despite pressure to follow his father into law.
These tensions incubate in the crumbling asylum, where the past seems to live on in its various pictures, implements, and dark places. Mike becomes interested in an old evidence recording he finds in a storage room, which describes the case of a frightened girl with multiple personality disorder. As he becomes more interested in the case, Hank finds something of interest in the basement and shortly disappears. Gordon confides a personal problem to his foreman Phil, who may have a problem of his own.
And Gordon's young nephew is terribly afraid of the dark.
As tensions crawl closer to the surface, it becomes clear that there is going to be a reckoning, and at this point it is impossible to stop watching the events unfold. I had a hard time figuring out just how things were going to turn out, which is always a fun challenge. When the end finally came, I was still left pondering the question 'Why?', until I thought more about the case of the girl with M. P. D. While the reasons for the final events are not exactly laid bare, it is a compelling, disturbing and thought provoking story.
Surely each viewer will understand this story in their own way, such is the beauty of the psycho-drama. Director Brad Anderson has a good cast, a great building to play in, and a very good script which he wrote with Stephen Gevedon (who plays Mike in the film).

I can't say enough good things about this movie.  It's the best-made, most atmospheric, genuinely creepiest horror movie I've seen in a long, long time.  It's the kind of movie that restores your faith in a whole genre, making up for every bad teen horror film and mindless sequel you might've sat through in the last few years.  What can I say?  ""Session 9"" is the fleck of gold you hope against hope to catch gleaming amid the broken rocks and sand at the bottom of your pan.
Directed by Brad Anderson (""Next Stop Wonderland""), ""Session 9"" tells the story of a team of six asbestos abatement workers hired to clean out in one week's time the deserted Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusettes.  The film was shot onsite in the historic red-bricked monster of a building once known as the Danvers Lunatic Asylum.  There's no shortage of creepy atmosphere at hand, and the film-makers use it to their purpose, slowly bringing to boil a tale of escalating interpersonal frictions and dizzying madness.
""Session 9"" works on many levels.  On the surface, it's a taught thriller, offering more than a few jump-out-of-your seat scares; it's also an interesting character study of six men thrown together under high-pressure conditions.  The acting is all top-notch, but Peter Mullen and David Caruso are particularly good as the boss and foreman of the asbestos team. At its heart, ""Session 9"" is a compelling psychology tapestry, woven together from haunted voices, spooky sounds, and rich visual metaphor.
From the opening scenes where the team tours the massive building, it's pretty obvious that Brad Anderson didn't miss the day in film school when they studied Stanley Kubrick.  The prominence of slow, wide tracking shots, ironic daylight, and place-as-character motifs are all strongly reminiscent of The Shining.""  So is much of the storyline.  But ""Session 9"" is more than just a ""Shining"" knock-off.  It slowly builds its own character and atmosphere, managing to create something original, modern, and truly scary.  If you're a fan of great horror films and have begun to worry that they don't even try to make them anymore, please see ""Session 9.""",1017792000,166,2302,4.945454545454545
1667040,5,B00005UQ9F,"I sat down to watch Session 9 at midnight on a Friday. That was mistake number one. I was also expecting a film that was not very realistic and something that I would think could never happen. That was mistake number 2.
Session 9 had me jumping at every little noise in my apartment after the first twenty minutes of the film. The part of this movie that made it so scary was that the story could have been a true story. There was no supernatural power pushing people to the edge, there was no crazy person back from the dead, just someone's mind, and a freaky building.
This film grabs hold because it is about normal hard working people, who are not strange, but could live next door. This movie could realistically happen, and that is what makes this so frightening.
I also liked the Extra deleted scenes, which show an alternate story line that was cut from the movie, and the director's commentary. I would suggest picking up Session 9, just don't watch it alone at midnight!",1017619200,,980,4.4804469273743015
1667041,5,B00005UQ9F,What is so special about this film is simply that it is real. There are no supernatural events or episodes that would render it a cheesy movie. The acting is superb and worthy or note. People have been complaining about the end and that it is hard to figure out. You know what?? Those are the type of movies that succeed best. It gets you to think about what you have seen and explore many different possibilites. I recommend this to any horror fan,1017532800,,448,4.345238095238095

Brad Anderson revives some of the most cliche haunted house conventions with stylish direction, complex story layering, and enough plot twists to keep you curious and creeped out. The film is packed with great shots and beautifully framed images that will stick in your head days after you watch. Although the performances (especially David Caruso's) occasionally fall flat and the voice over technique is pretty silly, Session 9 is a must see for anyone who loves a good scary movie.",1017446400,,517,5.094117647058823
1667043,4,B00005UQ9F,"Session 9 (Brad Anderson, 2001)

Since Scream, America has been inundated with horror films that want to be hip and trendy. Leave it to Hollywood to overlook the hippest and trendiest of them. Session 9 is The Others without an A-list actor to lend it credibility; it's all about atmosphere rather than shock value. That will probably turn most horror film fans off, but the true aficionado will find a whole lot here to like.

The premise is a nice one: a team of asbestos removal workers, led by two guys with the unassuming names of Phil (David Caruso) and Gordon (Peter ""My Name is Joe"" Mullan), are hired to clear out an old asylum. The crew finds a series of tapes regarding a particular patient, and they start listening to them on breaks. The closer they get to the end of the therapy, the more tense things get in the real world.

It's probably no coincidence that there are a whole lot of visual similarities between this film and the computer game version of John Saul's series novel The Blackstone Chronicles. Certain scenes could have been lifted straight from the game, and the actors dropped in. That said, it's probably not a coincidence that the two offer the viewer the same atmosphere, a slow, relentless building of tension. What makes Session 9 different than The Blackstone Chronicles (and The Others, for that matter), is that the right questions to ask in the game are irrelevant at the climax of the film. Whether the ghosts are all in the workers' heads or not doesn't matter a bit, except as post-film coffee-table discussion fodder. Anderson hands us the set of questions we expect, and then answers them with the answers to a completely different set. It's a beautiful thing; tends to put off people who don't like surprises (or, at least, those who like their surprises to come within a predetermined set of choices; e.g. most fans of your average run-of-the-mill horror flick), but done right can propel a film to greatness. This one comes pretty close. **** ",1017360000,2,1990,4.726224783861672
1667044,5,B00005UQ9F,"SESSION 9 is a terrific, atmospheric, haunting, dream-like pscyhological thriller with a unique setting:  the real-life Danvers Insane Asylum in Massachussets.  A five-man team of asbestos removers is tasked to rid the abandoned, maze-like building of asbestos in just one week.  Adding to the pressure of this seemingly-impossible job are the personal demons of each of the men working there.  Slowly, the evil influence of the Asylum, as well as the aforementioned personal issues of the men lead to a horrific turn of events.  Will any of the men live to tell about their week at the asylum?  Is there something sinister there, or is one or more of them insane? Therein lies the hook of the movie.
Let me just say this right now.  If you're a fan of ""cutesy"" horror, then Session 9 is not for you.  When I say ""cutesy"" horror, I mean horror that involves 1)self-aware teenagers or young adults spouting dialogue that sounds like it was penned by Kevin Williamson, 2) a slasher wearing a ghostmask/parka/rain slicker/fisherman's hood/fencing mask/cherub mask/whatever, and 3) at least one or two faces on hiatus from the WB Network.  In other words, everything that followed SCREAM (SCREAM's success was really a double-edged sword: on one hand it revived the horror genre.  On the other hand, we will probably have to suffer putrid, self-aware SCREAM rip-offs until the end of the world.  I don't know whether we should celebrate Kevin Williamson, or slap him silly)
SESSION 9 is, at the risk of sounding like a snob, a thinking-person's horror movie.  Many things are open to interpretation.  The pieces form different puzzles at different times.  At the best of times, all you have are suspicions and fears, nothing known for sure.  If you like SCREAM and it's progeny, this movie will frustrate the living heck out of you.  But if you like films like THE SHINING and DON'T LOOK NOW, where the pace is deliberately slow to lull you into a sense of unease and dread, where seemingly benign environments gradually morph into treacherous and terrifying wastelands, where even after the film has ended, you are looking over your shoulder because, without realizing it, the film has gotten under your skin, if you like all these things in a movie, then SESSION 9 is for you.
My hat is off to Brad Anderson and Steve Gevedon (the writers of SESSION 9--ANderson also directed, while Gevedon also acts).  In a perfect world, their SESSION 9 would have been the one to revive the horror genre, and not Kevin Williamson's SCREAM.  But as we all know...",1017187200,2,2547,4.856481481481482
1667055,5,B00005UQ9F,"I recently picked up a copy of Session 9, and I must say this is one film that had me turning lights on to reach my bedroom at night.
The story focuses on an abandon mental institution and the 5 men tasked to complete an asbestos job within a week period.  As the story progresses one of the men stumbles upon a series of session tapes left from the 1980s before the institution had closed.  These tapes review a psychiatrist and a female patient's sessions on her split personalities and past sexual (satanic) abuse as a child.  These sessions bring madness to the 5 men working day to day to complete thier job.  This film will keep you guessing til the end. Do these sessions play a supernatural role or do the men and ourselves just let imaginations run wild.
I guarantee the ending is pretty startling.  If you enjoyed the Blair Witch Project ""plot"" (not the crazy ""make you sick"" camera work),  then you will enjoy this film.
Session 9 does not contain a weak ""flavor of the week MTV metal band"" soundtrack.  Nor does it contain a stupid serial killer running around in a mask hunting down top heavy women.  Those type of films are ""not scary"".  This is.  Especially if you are tired of seeing women as the victims.  If you rent this movie please rent the DVD for the extras (especially the deleted scenes).  These scenes give you a little more to the story that you might not know when watching it the first time.  I must say I will add it to my collection soon.",1016928000,,1469,4.396296296296296
1667056,1,B00005UQ9F,"...I always enjoyed David Caruso's work on television, but I have yet to see him in a film that I feel truly showcases his talents.  Also, I rarely write negative reviews -- of films, books, or music -- but after watching this last night, I feel like I've been insulted.
The building in this film -- an abandoned mental hospital -- is definitely possessed of a personality of its own, but I can't say much for the charcters or plot.  Several interesting avenues are approached -- but none of them are explored at any length or with any intelligence.  One of the characters in the film stumbles upon a cache of tapes relating to a notorious sexual abuse case, involving efforts of doctors to awaken repressed memories in a multiple-personality disorder patient -- but other than listening to a few of the tapes and making some notes, that's as far as this is explored.
I also found it a little hard to swallow that the haz-mat team featured in the film, pressed to do what they admit is at least a two-to-three week job in a week's time, finds so much opportunity to sit around and irritate each other and explore the various rooms and corridors of the hospital.
The atmosphere depicted in the film was nicely portrayed, but that's about the only plus I could find in it.  I was left feeling like I had wasted an evening.",1016668800,9,1320,4.510460251046025
1667057,4,B00005UQ9F,"Session 9 is an intense, but somehow low key film that moves in and out of being a story about working class people trying to make a living, and a haunted house tell. I'm not sure at what point I started questioning the movie's action, but it seems to me at some point the whole thing went askew, turning into a slasher movie. I know this sounds like a bad review, but its not, this is a well-crafted film that uses a building as a character better than any film I've seen in a long time. In my opinion it would have been a little stronger if the working class aspect and the work these guys were doing had been played up a little more, or maybe if the filmmaking crew would have gone more for the creepiness & ghost story- shoot I don't know!

1667058,3,B00005UQ9F,"A group of men, headed by Gordon (Peter Mullen) and Phil (David Caruso)are elected to perform an asbestos removal at a local abandoned insane asylum.  These two men and a few other pals find themselves in a one week job that offers much more than they bargained for.
  It's all about atmosphere. There are no outright or obvious gouls or ghosts to frighten you and spook you until you spill your popcorn. The asylum, with it's peeling paint, creepy security blocks , and sweaty, gritty,  claustrophopic feel is what gives this movie a slow, rhythmic suspense and chill.
  As the men go about their business they each encounter various forms of quiet insanity.  Gordon becomes irritable toward others, almost paranoid. Phil seems to be meddling with everybody's notions of work ethic.  One worker becomes obsessed with a cache of old money he finds in the deep abyss of the tunnels.  Another is phobic of dark spaces.
  It is the discovery of one employee that takes the movie in a very different direction. He finds himself obsessed, stealing hours from work to listen to tapes of a former deceased patient with a multiple personality disorder.  Eventually it feels as if all the men in some form or another develop an unusual attachment to the asylum.
  The tapes and records, once discovered and pilfered through, ignite a supernatural change in tempo that doesn't cease.  Slowly, the movie becomes more frightening, more surreal, and much more suspenseful..enough to keep you bound to your armchair until the killer ending.  Within the piles of documents, tapes, and discarded patient records, secrets are buried...waiting to be found.
  I only gave this movie 3 stars. Performances by David Caruso and Peter Mullen were good, but not their best performances. The rest of the cast was mediocre.  I loved the idea of the plot.  The asylum seemed to take on a life of it's own, affecting the crew like a virus..very reminiscent of the horror flick ""Event Horizon"".  The suspense was thrilling to say the least but the ending was a bizarre sequence of events that seemed a little too fabricated.  I needed to ask out loud once or twice...""I don't get it, do you?""
I would not highly recommend this movie for purchase. I think it's a fun night's rent.  I was told last night when I picked this movie off the shelf (I had never heard of it before) at my video store and asked ""What's this one about?"", that it was a huge favorite.  Apparently ""Session 9"" is some cult favorite amongst the renters where I live.  So, if you are daring ..go ahead and enjoy this rather unknown favorite.",1016496000,4,2582,4.748314606741573

Another freaky point is how 2 times in the movie a sudden, violent mental break is brought on by a simple every day accident which results in someone violently murdering their loved ones. It also has a well written cast of central characters played by David Caruso as the greedy one, Peter Mullan as the veteren, Stephen Gevedon as the smart one, Brenden Sexton III as the rookie, and Josh Lucas as the jerk.",1016496000,,695,4.568

1667061,5,B00005UQ9F,"I had heard many good things about Session 9, and I was very upset that it never had a theatrical run here in Rochester, N.Y.; I always prefer to see horror movies in a theater- they're scarier that way. Anyway, I ran right out and bought Session 9 on DVD as soon as it came out, and despite the great ""Buzz"" on the film, I sat down to watch, and was prepared to be disappointed. (Usually, the more I look forward to seeing a film, the bigger a letdown it turns out to be...)
  Well, the opening shot of a wheelchair sitting in a hallway of the abandoned Mental Hospital chased all my doubts away! From that promising (and CREEPY AS HELL!) opening shot, session 9 fulfills all of it's promises.
  The film tracks the weeklong efforts of a 5-man Asbestos Removal Crew, as they struggle to meet the insane deadline that their boss has set them for the cleanup of the aforementioned abandoned Hospital. The Boss, Gordy, is in desperate need of cash, and if the crew finishes in a week, the state has promised a $10,000.00 bonus. There are problems among the other men, too. One has stolen another's Girlfriend. Gordon's nephew is inexperienced, and, unknown to the rest of the crew, is afraid of the dark. And Mike, who longs to leave Haz-Mat work behind for the Law career he blew off Six Years ago, has just found a box of Audiotaped Psychiatry Sessions between a Psychiatrist and his Multiple-Personality patient, Mary Hobbes......Mike soon becomes obsessed with the tapes, sneaking away from the job to listen to the increasingly frightening sessions (Session 9 is the final tape), and read Mary's case history.
  It isn't long before a crew member turns up missing, tempers flare, and the truth about Session 9 becomes apparent.
  Director Brad Anderson has crafted a truly amazing film, due, in no small regard, to the incredibly forbidding setting of The Danvers State Hospital. The building is the TRUE star of the film, and the lush way that she is filmed only adds to the creep-out factor. Even though I KNEW THE END (Because some idiot posted a review here that blew the whole thing.....THANKS, JACKASS.), it was still shocking and sad to see it happen. I really got to know the characters; even the ones I didn't like had redeeming, human qualities. The final line of dialogue in the film is one that will forever be ingrained in my memory. I watched the end Three times last night, and I still get chills down my spine thinking about it....amazingly well-written. It's a crime that this movie wasn't given more exposure, especially in light of the success of Films like The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, and The Others...Could the horrible Blair Witch II have given distributors cold feet...?
  The DVD comes packed with extras; The commentary track is very informative, and there are 10 minutes of extra footage, mostly dealing with a sub-plot that was entirely cut, and a different ending that is equally chilling.
  Anyone looking for that true rarity, a well-made Horror movie, needs to pick up Session 9.",1016323200,2,3027,4.712121212121212

1667064,2,B00005UQ9F,"After witnessing the utterly disappointing, disjointed mess that is ""Session 9,"" I think it's safe to say that Brad Anderson's psychological thriller is one of the genre's biggest letdowns. On the outside, the movie has the look and feel of a wonderfully different venue into horror, with its story of possession amongst an atmosphere of growing dread. But once the end starts rearing its ugly, ludicrous head, things start going batty, leading us to wonder what asylum Anderson himself was released from before penning the script.
The film starts out well enough, introducing us to Gordon Fleming (Peter Mullan), who runs an asbestos removal company comprised of a small group of men. His top man, Phil (David Caruso), tags along for the ride during a preliminary visit to Hazmat Elimination's latest project: the Danvers State Mental Hospital, abandoned for over 15 years, chosen to undergo renovation for the municipal offices of the nearby town.
Anderson scores his big points (his only points, in fact) from his setting. Filmed on location at the actual site of Danvers, ""Session 9"" benefits from having a structure that evokes a sense of doom from the very first frame. The film captures various shots of the complex, its aerial overviews reminiscent of the Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining,"" it's ground shots recalling the looming, oppressive Hill House in Robert Wise's ""The Haunting.""
Even the insides of the complex are seen in the film, as the majority of the story takes place within spaces that range from expansive to claustrophobia-inducing. Sunshine floods into certain areas of the hospital, filling the now-decrepit rooms with brilliant white light, while the lower, far-more deteriorating levels are cast into darkness, pierced by the flashlights of the men about to enter. I must say, I've never seen anything quite like the setting of Anderson's film, and in spite of the various shortcomings, the visual acuity of the film is a remarkable achievement in itself.
It's only a shame that the plot is more of a mess than Danvers itself. After Gordon agrees to get the job done in one week, the five-man crew find themselves cast into another world, and soon, what the movie would have us believe is another dimension. After some preliminary spooks resulting from offscreen sounds, one of the workers turns up missing. Later, fingers start pointing between Phil and Gordon, who is apparently becoming unstable as a result of- well, what? Is it his own personal demons? Or those conjured up by the tape recorded therapy sessions that another crew member listens to incessantly in one of the hospital's decrepit archival rooms?
Gradually, the film starts to lose its appeal, evolving from what appeared to be engrossing into just plain off-putting. Whatever tension was generated in the beginning acts founders as we start to ponder the psychological logistics, who is responsible for what, etc. By the time the ""surprise"" ending rolls around, revealing everything that we pretty much knew five minutes ahead of time, audience members may be more inclined to roll their eyes in disgust at Anderson's surrender to violence and gore, senseless tactics he was able to stray from for much of the film's duration.
The feeling I got from ""Session 9"" was a goal of originality that just wasn't met. There's an aura of unfamiliarity to the work, but the lack of achievement in the story and character departments is not easily overlooked (at times, the peeling paint and deteriorated ceiling panels obtain more interest). Anderson is too confident that style can pass as substance, providing us with a film that is visually enticing, but may drive some people clinically insane just thinking about its hackneyed premise.",1015977600,7,3744,5.0894308943089435

Just walking around it is enough to send chills up a person's spine.

Mullen plays the leader of a group of men employed to remove asbestos and other toxic substances from the building, in preparation for its use as a public administration building.

The screenwriters give you so many fine red herrings that the ending works quite well.

Shot in the real-life abandoned Danvers mental hospital near Boston (most of what you see in the movie is as the crew found it).
SESSION 9 is one the most horrifying movies of 2001, and it's not even technically a horror film--at least, not as many people understand horror to be. In other words, there are no mask-wearing psychos or ghosts that jump out and yell ""Boo!"" The film works on the psychological level, taking you into the darkest recesses of the characters' minds as it takes you into the darkest recesses of the Danvers Hospital. That's true horror, because few things are more terrifying than what the human mind can conjure up, or what it's capable of under duress. As a result, even the stock genre devices--the character who wears headphones when he shouldn't; the generator running out of power at the wrong time--have their intended effect, because they seem genuine in the context of the story. The conclusion is somewhat confusing, but most of the pieces do fall into place upon reflection.
The script doesn't rule out a supernatural dimension to the story, but neither is it necessarily present. Everything in the movie has a plausible explanation. Whether something otherworldly is happening is left to the audience to decide, and that's part of the fun...and if you find yourself scoffing at the premise once the film is done, note that the story is inspired by a true incident that occurred in Boston several years ago.",1015459200,9,1617,4.926739926739927
1667084,4,B00005UQ9F,"Brad Anderson's moody, dark thriller Session 9 is a brilliant exercise in what horror films should be.  Two parts mood and one part acting, the film is devoid of blood, ghost-story clichs like psychics and other such mumbo-jumbo, and even the ""force"" itself.  It's an experiment that works and works astonishingly well, evoking classics like ""The Haunting of Hill House"" (which later became the basis for the wonderfully gothic 1963 movie and the awful 1999 remake) and ""Rebecca.""  Session 9 is also unique because it involves a group of blue-collar, normal, every-day Joes, something you don't usually see in cinema much, let alone horror films.
The action follows Gordon and his Hazmat Cleanup crew.  Their job is to turn the Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts (a real, closed mental institution, it is worth noting, and the admitted inspiration for Lovecraft's infamous Arkham Asylum) from a health risk into a habitable building, and to do so in a week.  The prize: a $10000 bonus that each worker really needs.  But things begin to get in the way: personal conflicts between the workers, Gordon's less-than-perfect home life, a room full of files that contain recordings of various ""sessions"" with a psychotic patient, and... something else.
Like other good horror movies, the fear is built not from things jumping out at the characters, but the sense of dread that slowly builds throughout the movie until the gut-tightening crescendo at the end.  Credit goes three places for this: the actors, who manage to portray their descent with striking realism; the Hospital itself, with its rotting walls, rusted clocks, and abandoned wheelchairs and medical apparatuses; and the cinematographers, who skew each shot just subtly enough to create a sense of paranoid and ""being watched.""
The supernatural force - if it exists at all - never makes an appearance, and there is nothing that jumps out at the characters to scare them.  Instead, Session 9 offers such a sense of claustrophobia and impending doom that it stays with you long after you shut the lights off, which is what horror films are supposed to do.  The only complaints about this DVD aren't from the movie, but from its presentation: there's no anamorphic widescreen (it's letterboxed), and the sound, while good, is not presented in a 5.1 digital or DTS track.  In this day and age, it's almost a crime to not present a movie in anamorphic widescreen, especially a movie as great as this.  The DVD is still worth the purchase; I bought it ""blind"" (without seeing the movie) and was very impressed.",1015459200,4,2567,4.9882903981264635
1667085,4,B00005UQ9F,"In the fall of 2000, 3 of my friends and I were given a tour of Danvers State Hospital by a guy who worked there in the early 80's. The entire building is boarded up with the exception of one entrance located in the machine shop area maybe 200 feet behind the main building, where the guards are on duty in a trailer.
When you enter the machine shop at the very back wall there is a small opening which leads to the subtunnels. At the mouth of the subtunnels, there are 3 to choose from and then they lead 200 feet up to the main building. Once in the main building, you climb up to the basement which is where a few of the scenes were filmed in the movie. The rooms where the most dangerous patients were kept, the shock machine room (where I tripped over a rusted shock machine lying on the floor) and the file rooms much like the one where the tapes are found in this movie.
The upstairs is not QUITE so creepy as light pours through the windows. The gymnasium/auditorium (where is where I went to an extras call for the movie The Proposal) is a mess.. spray painted, the floor torn up. Along the hallways, windows are smashed, the floors and ceilings have massive water damage (on the 3rd floor I opened a door to a patient room and the roof had caved into the room, thru the floor to the room on the second floor, thru that room and crashed on the floor of the room on the 1st) The directors office which was pretty much made of solid oak all the way around had moss growing on the gold colored rug.
Believe me... this building is CREEPY. I was constantly looking behind me, especially in the subtunnels where you could only see about 5 ft ahead of you even with a huge mag-lite. (I wasn't too pleased when on the way out, my flashlight died and I slipped on the mud and touched the asbestos and mold covered tunnel wall to catch myself)
When I heard about this movie, I rushed into Cambridge the opening weekend with 2 of my friends (one of which is a horror FANATIC) to see what it was all about. It was, like the building itself, creepy. I was a little disappointed with the ending but the acting, the script and my love of that place made up for it.
Definatly see this movie, you will begin to understand the chills I had for the 5 hours I was in Danvers State Hospital exploring. And if you ever get the chance, get inside with a tour guide (as you WILL get lost) before they tear the building down to make a hotel. Pay your respects to the patients in the unmarked graves down the hill as well and your tour will probably go a lot more smoothly.",1015372800,5,2556,4.1971544715447155
1667086,5,B00005UQ9F,"""Fear is a place"", and it lives here in this abandoned mental asylum!  Although I grew up in Boston (and S9 takes place not too far from here), I don't think I am biased to this fantastically CREEPY film!  I've seen it twice now - in the theatre and on DVD and can honestly say that I am in love - with Session 9!  The lone fact that it is filmed entirely in the (once active) Danvers Mental Hospital, places S9 far above the recent cookie-cutter Hollywood haunted house flicks (i.e. House on Haunted Hill and the like) this place is the real thing - no goofy computer generated scenes, just a group of blue collar workers and this amazing building (similar to the Overlook hotel in Kubrick's classic version of the Shining - It's truly the best screen vision of any ""haunted house"" EVER on film.  If you enjoy a psychologically haunting film vs. a gore fest slasher flick, then odds are you will truly enjoy Session 9.  A warning...  Don't watch it alone...

1667087,4,B00005UQ9F,"I really really enjoyed the movie! It was suspenseful, creepy, and it definately kept me glued to my seat! I was literally shaking because I wanted to see how it was going to end! I wanted to know the whole story and I knew this puzzle piece would be completed by the end. Well the puzzle piece was completed...most of it. There were still some unanswered questions left at the end that I was asking myself and that is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I'm not quite sure if Brad Anderson wanted us to think supernatural or if he just wanted to show the comparisons between the insane person in the movie and the recording sessions that happened in the hospital. Is ""Simon"" really more than we think? I'm either really stupid or I just didn't look close enough. Other than those unanswered questions, the movie was awesome! The acting was superb and the suspense hit you at all the right moments. The way it was filmed made me feel like I was watching a movie made in the 80's, but I think it added to the atmosphere. The music was the creepiest...it will send chills down your spine.

Danvers Asylum was underused, which is sad. Hoping the special features will redeem the disc.

Maybe I had over-hyped it in my head, but it was a serious let down. I thought it was going to have a big twist ending, sadly it didn't. I had read several glowing reviews on different ""creepy story"" sites, blogs, and in these reviews. It did not live up to the hype. I had gone into it knowing that it was supposed to be a psychological thriller, which is my favorite genre of movies. This was pretty uninteresting from start to finish. I wouldn't have bought a physical copy had I known it was this dull. Like I said, maybe I had it too built up as an amazing indie movie with a great twist ending, but the only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the physical product worked.",1516665600,,805,4.26797385620915

7955093,3,B00005UQ9F,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'Session 9' released by Universal Studio's Home Entertainment in 2002.

Don't look too deep into this movie. That's the mistake I made while watching it. I was looking for all kinds of answers and I was trying to predict what was going to happen. Even when the movie ended I was kind of saying to myself, 'What did I miss?' The answer is 'nothing.' I watched parts of the documentary and the producers pretty much explained that they just wanted to make a movie in an abandoned asylum and the made a plot around that. There is nothing deep here at all. Maybe this is a good thing (See my Conclusion in last paragraph.)

The documentary is almost like one of those found footage documentaries. All the actors tell you about how 'creeped out' they were and how they really believe they witnessed supernatural stuff going on.

Sure, the movie has it's creepy moments but it all leads nowhere.

****SPOILERS****
They came up with the hazardous material angle to get people there and somebody goes crazy. That's it.

Right at the beginning of the movie we learn that when the asylum shut it's doors, some of the patients were just released. I thought for sure that one of the workers, possibly the owner was going to be one of the previous tenants. Nope, they were just giving you some true historical facts about the place. Just a red herring.

In fact, the title 'Session 9' is just one big red herring. One of the guys finds some old tapes of a patient and starts listening to them. They are labeled session 1, session 2, etc. I thought when we got to Session 9 we would get a big reveal. Wrrrrooonnngggg!!! We never get to Session 9. Those tapes meant nothing to the movie and the guy who was listening gets killed before he even gets to session 9.

They make a point of pointing out that if any of the asbestos gets in your mouth, you will slowly die. Later on, one of the guys does breath in some dust but ultimately this is just another red herring. This has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and there is no effect on the character. Yep, another red herring.

Each of the characters has something going on, some ulterior motives, etc. None of it means anything except possibly giving motives for the murders from a character who is already crazy.

Since you've read the spoilers I might as well tell you it's the owner of the hazardous materials company that goes crazy. Nothing that any of the other characters do or none of the subplots that are created come into play at all. A subplot is created about the owner badly needing this job or he will be out of business and he makes promises he probably can't keep. This leads nowhere. To be sure, there are several other subplots, they just don't go anywhere. They are there just to make you think something is going on. One of the subplots actually results in another person coming to the facility but he is there for an instant. He is brought in just to be another person killed. I'm not sure if these subplots going nowhere was intentional or they just didn't know what direction to go in when filming the movie. The producers pretty much admit that they just wanted to make a movie in the asylum and didn't have a plot.
****END OF SPOILERS****

RECOMMENDATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Well this is an insane asylum movie so if you like that sub-genre of horror movies then this is for you.
I was going to give this movie 2 stars because of the poor plot but it really wasn't that bad. It just wasn't that good. Then I thought about it some more and said to myself, ""you know, I should give this 4 stars. Well 3 1/2 but you can't do that."" 4 stars would be just too much for this movie.
The reason for my second thoughts are as.....well, follow the logic. You really don't see any movies that have all kinds of angles and subplots that have nothing to do with the movie. Sure, a director throws in something unnecessary every now and then to throw you off. But almost the entire plot and subplots was unnecessary. Even the title had nothing to do with the movie!
By having no originality, no plot lines that go anywhere and a title that is meaningless..in an odd sort of way..this movie is pretty original! So 5 stars for originality. 1 star for the plot. Average 3 stars. Done. I'd give it one more but then that would deceive people into thinking I thought it was better than what it was.",1508803200,,4384,4.421313506815365
