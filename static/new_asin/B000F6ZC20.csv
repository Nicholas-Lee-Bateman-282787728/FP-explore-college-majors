8118349,4,B000F6ZC20,"I remember when the story first broke, I was the mother of a teenager, I was taken aback.  Later as time went on and I kept reading about her in the news papers and her trials, I began to feel differently, not sorry but differently because the controversies began to surface such as, ""If it had been a man, the punishment would have been excessive, what makes her so different"".  Through out these years, I asked the same thing and felt she should have gotten ""due punishment"".  After Mary Kay went to prison and Filau began going out with other women, I lost track of the story and just knew they were through.  I then read she was in prison and still sending Villi Filau(think this is how you spell it) love letters and by then they had two children, I began to take notice and then I tried to read everything about her.  I read all about her suffering while she stood steadfast to her convictions.  This Biography was great and told all about her suffering, personal as well as with society. They may not live happily ever after but at least she did prove something to everyone, that the love between her and Filau is so thick, Black & Decker couldn't cut it.  I now admire her so much because she had the back bone to stand strong. There are no seas or mountains that can stand in front of love.  Way to go Mary Kay!!!!!",1431388800,,1324,4.310483870967742

8118351,4,B000F6ZC20,"I saw this bio on Mary Kay Letourneau sometime ago. You know how they show repeats. I thought it was very interesting and very sad. That's right. I feel sorry for Mary Kay Letourneau. I feel sorry for a female pedo-phile. And this brings me to my point. While I can't feel sympathy for a man sleeping with a young girl, I can for a woman sleeping with a boy because the situations are simply different. Notice I said sympathize, not condone or like or accept or encourage.

Not too many of us can know what it's like to be this psychologically damaged. Even after hearing her story, I still can't grasp why Mary Kay was drawn to a little boy. But I will say it is misguided to ask a pedo-phile why they want children when there are plenty of adults walking around. It's all about what you want, not about availability or whether it's right or wrong or sensible or unsensible. Nobody wakes up saying they want to be a social outcast or freak. Except the people in Hollywood, of course.

What she did was totally wrong and she should have been punished. Relationships like this can't be allowed to happen. But I can't agree with those who say a woman sleeping with a boy is just as bad as a man sleeping with a girl. It's not the same. The sexes are not the same. Sameness is not synonymous with equality. There are biological and psychological differences between the genders that dictate our behavior, and I simply refuse to see a horny 14 year old boy as a severely damaged victim of an attractive woman. And this is the major reason I can feel sympathy for a woman in this position but not a man.

There is a long history of women being preyed upon by men. How many men have been preyed upon by women? Men have too much power in the world to be subjected to the whims and prejudices of women. Even most 13 year old boys already have more physical power than grown women. This put boys in a position to fight back. That's more than we can say about female victims. The double standard is a justified one.

I don't see many horny adolescent boys fighting, physically or emotionally, a woman cute enough to be on TV. Boys want sex. They dream about it and act on it any chance they get. They try to corrupt girls their own age because they want it. Then, they brag about and pursue more of it. Once again, I'm not saying boys can't be sexual victims of women, but I am saying most of them are enjoying it too much for me to really feel sorry for them. And Mary Kay's ""victim"" now husband, is/was a prime example of that.

Once again, both cases of pedo/philia are wrong, but not wrong to the same degree.",1158192000,16,2603,4.3040816326530615
