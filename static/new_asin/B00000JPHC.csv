1236320,4,B00000JPHC,"While not my favorite, this is a decent version of the classic tale by Kenneth Grahame. This version is made by Martin Gates, and is in full screen, The colors and characters are good for kids, the length is 71 minutes. Now the Disney version is fun, but too short. The best animated version in my mind is the one with the live introduction by Vanessa Redgrave produced by John Coates (who produced The Snowman). It is beautiful, sticks closer to the original book than any other.
So again, this version is decent and fun to watch, great for kids, and if you want to see another version of the classic it is worth a a viewing.",1262304000,7,626,4.358974358974359
1236321,5,B00000JPHC,"I've seen 3 movie versions of The Wind in the Willows, including this one.  This is the Martin Gates production, which I like the best.  It follows closely the tale by the original author, although some of the chapters from the book are left out, but that's okay.  If you haven't read the book, this movie will inspire you to do so.  The Disney version (which my husband prefers) is cute and shorter in length, although they did add a few new characters and changed a few things.  And the 4-pack video HBO Home Video version is also good, although I wish they wouldn't make Toad to be such a cartoonish super-conceited fool.  I highly recommend this video for good, wholesome family entertainment.",989625600,32,697,4.626016260162602

7913106,3,B00000JPHC,"The story is a little lacking, not the movie makers fault.  The voices in the movie are annoying.  I'm a teacher and I showed it to the kids after we read the book.  It followed the book closely and the kids loved it.  Can't say I did.",1404864000,,235,3.9361702127659575
7913107,5,B00000JPHC,There are many versions of Wind in the Willow. My children enjoyed this one. We were going to a play and I wanted them to have some background experience without reading the book. The book was at a much higher level.  This is great for the younger elementary age children.,1369785600,,272,4.44
