4063151,4,B00336V4DU,"""Skin"" is the story of Sandra Laing (Sophie Okonedo), born black in the 1950's to white Afrikaners unaware of their black ancestry.  Her parents, rural shopkeepers Abraham (Sam Neill) and Sannie (Alice Krige) who serve the local black community, lovingly raise her as their ""white"" little girl.  Still, at the age of ten, facing prejudice from her community due to her dark skin and African features, Sandra is driven out of her society.  The film follows Sandra's 30-year odyssey from rejection to acceptance, betrayal to reconciliation, as she struggles to define her place in a changing world against countless obstacles.

Ms. Okonedo plays Sandra not as a symbol of black struggle in apartheid-era South Africa but as a determined woman attempting to discover her true self.  As a mature woman and mother, her Sandra still looks to heal psychological wounds inflicted on her as a child.  South Africa's Population Registration Act of 1950 required people to be identified, defined, classified, and separated by color, but in Sandra's home town, folks were less intolerant.

O'Neill's Abraham is sympathetic as he attempts to have the law changed so Sandra can be classified by heritage rather than appearance, but also reveals himself to have deep-seated racism.

Bonus extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette, deleted scenes, outtakes, and script development workshops.",1297814400,41,1380,5.356481481481482
4063152,5,B00336V4DU,This movie was heavy in subject matter and it had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was next. Excellent movie and a dose of reality.,1296604800,,139,4.0
4063153,4,B00336V4DU,"Drama set mainly during the Apartheid-era in South Africa telling the story of Sandra Laing (played by Sophie Okonedo), a young Afrikanner woman who although having white biological parents by a genetic fluke is born black and the problems that this causes her in the society in which she lives. A stirring performance largely by Sophie Okonedo (who plays Sandra Laing from about the age of 17) as we follow Sandra Laing's life over a period of about 30 years; from when she is about 10 to 12 years old and experiences severe racism from staff and pupils at the boarding school she is attending because she is seen as black (the 10 to 12 year old Laing is played by another actress, not Okonedo); through the landmark court case that her parents fight in which she is officially classed as white; through her disownment at about the age of 17 by her parents when she falls for and elopes with a young black man who works for her father; through her decision to be reclassified as black because she feels rejected by Afrikanner society; through times of severe hardship such as when the Afrikanner establishment bulldozes her home because the government has decreed that the settlement in which she lives is now in a `whites-only' area; through seeing her husband and father of her two children over time become a violent drunk who at least once violently assaults her, leading her to leave him and fend for her two children on her own as a black single mother in apartheid-era south Africa; and finally through the pain that Laing carries over a period of about 20 years because  she is estranged from her parents and wishes to be reunited with them again (especially her mother). Most of the film takes place against the backdrop of the injustice that was apartheid in South Africa and the film does not shy away from graphic depictions of the racism, prejudice and hostility towards blacks that was prevalent during the apartheid-era in South Africa. Although a somewhat bleak film with much sorrow in it, the film does end on a hopeful note as Laing lives to see the abolition of apartheid when she is in her forties (in the early 1990s) and the beginnings of the new South Africa. Hence the film's story is ultimately a positive one, because Laing's story is also the story of South Africa. Rewarding viewing.",1281312000,32,2313,4.683046683046683
4063154,4,B00336V4DU,"My immediate question upon seeing this film is: ""Why is this on DVD in Europe, but not in America?""  It was only available at the art house in Chicago for about a week.  I think there are a lot of possibilities.  First, in this supposed ""post-racial"" US, maybe viewers do not want to think about another country during its very racial era.  This takes place in Southern Africa, but it doesn't have the suspense and cleverness of ""Hotel Rwanda.""  Whereas Americans may feel that genocide in that region was not their fault, the apartheid system may remind US viewers too much of slavery and films dealing with slavery often perform poorly.  This is the opposite of ""Imitation of Life.""  There, the main character didn't want others to know her secret, here the main character could not hide it: it's written on her skin, thus the title.

This film is all about racial fictions.  What do you do when two white-looking, pro-apartheid parents have a Black-looking child?  Do you punish her or the parents?  There's a difference between de facto and de jure: while on paper, the main character is deemed white, but most white South Africans did not see her that way.  In American history, this situation was ""solved"" by the ""one-drop rule.""  However, the US has had its own stickiness.  On paper in many states, people of different races could not marry each other, yet Mrs. Loving was punished for marrying a white man when her ancestors were not punished for marrying between Blacks and American Indians.

Putting race aside, many female viewers who feel torn between their headstrong fathers versus their headstrong husbands may relate to this.  The film also shows instances of undying love between family members.

I'm an African American and I think African-American viewers may feel very comfortable with most of what's seen on film.  I bristled when the young girl said, ""I'm not Black!""  However, she eventually learns that ""Hey!  If I get deemed Black, I might as well unite with other Black folks.""  Some of us know many Black transracial adoptees who are very Black-identified because the world tells them repeatedly to which community they belong.  Recently, Obama only marked the Black box on the census and I was reminded of that in watching the main character.

Whereas ""The Color Purple"" showed a Black mother re-uniting with her African children, this showed an African woman attempting to re-unite with her mother.  I usually hate when DVDs don't have Spanish or French subtitles.  You would especially expect a European DVD to have it, as multilingual as that continent is.  However, the dialogue is in English and Xhosa (or some South African language) and many already-bilingual films don't have subtitle options.  An example is ""The Joy Luck Club.""  This is the second time I've seen Sam Neill in a race-related film; the first being ""Sally Hemmings.""  Some viewers may bristle seeing him as a villain, but his character is dynamic in a way.

My only critique is that matters seemed rushed at time.  In fairness, it's hard to present someone's whole life in just 100 minutes.  However, I felt like the main character got with her husband and got pregnant much too quickly.  The actual Ms. Laing looks nothing like Sophie O., so she should be honored they chose her for the role.",1278633600,12,3296,4.849462365591398

At first I couldn't figure out how white parents would produce a child of color but I thought one or both must carry a recessive gene for brown skin. The sad part is that the father thought it was so important for his daughter to be classified as white so she wouldn't be subjected to the prejudice that surrounds her. His heart was in the right place but to expect her to erase her identy is cruel. What the movie shows is how ridiculous it is to qualify people by race(gender,sexual orientation,etc.).

4063263,4,B00336V4DU,"Sandra Laing should be more widely known in South Africa. I doubt we value the lessons learned from the our own past as we do from school. Imagine a world where you are classified according to what the government laws dictate. That was the reality of Apartheid South Africa.

Even in 2013 we see glimpses of this Apartheid mentality because mixed race people in this country seems to have a Pavlovian disposition to feeling inferior and acting that way. The violence among ""coloured people"" is disproportional higher when looked at prison populations. So this movie is actually an important link between the past, the present and the future of mixed race people in South Africa.

What is striking about Sandra Laing is how her parents are both supremely dedicated and yet divided in how they treat their daughter. Everything manages to proceed as planned while she's in school, and even after she's asked to leave the school. Even her older brother stands by her even though he admits it's difficult.

How do we break free from our parents, from our roots and discover new ones? There is a Freudian element to Sandra's relationship with her father. He fights for her, he is strong-willed and takes on the government in one scene. Yet, he has doubts about whether she is indeed his biological child. At least this makes him human in sense. The family is surrounded by black people, some as labourers and some as clients in their shop in a rural part of the country.

As she matures into a young lady, her father arranges dates for her with young white men. After a terrible incident where she avoids being rapped, she eventually strikes up a sexual relationship with a black man with whom she has two children. His anger sparked by group areas act, and how it was enforced in by the Apartheid government eventually leads to him physically abusing Sandra. She leaves with her children and makes her way to Johannesburg, the big city.

The movie ends where it began with the 1994 elections. The dream that was dreamed by her parents is still alive in her, especially her father's motto of ""never give up."" She tells her mother on her death bed, that was all that kept her going during the 20 years of separation.

This is a story that speaks about all those things that makes us human: family, identity, uncertainty, choice and love.

4063270,5,B00336V4DU,"Skin is based on the real life story of Sandra Laing, a woman born in 1955, the dark days of South African apartheid. Both of Sandra's parents were lily-white South Afrikaners, belonged to the racist National Party and supported the apartheid system. But, surprise of surprises, daughter Sandra's skin was coffee-colored, and her haired dark and coiled, like a black African's. The problems this raised are obvious. How do you explain the situation to the neighbors? And how do you send a dark-skinned girl to racist, whites-only schools at a time when mixing races was literally against the law?

""Skin"" is a story of personal and state denial, only some of which are (barely) addressed in the film. On the personal side, you have to ask how such a child born to such a couple? The obvious hypothesis - the Sandra's mother was impregnated by a black man - was vehemently denied by Sandra's mother as well as her father. It's fairly easy to understand why. If Sandra's parents were really her parents, they would fight to ensure that their biological child was given all the privileges due to her ""race."" No matter the absurdity of trying to classify a brown girl as white. But if there was more to the story, what white woman of the time would admit an affair with a black man? And what husband, eager to deny his cuckolding would admit to the ""unimaginable"" conclusion of his wife's infidelity?

The South African state also had to perform mental gymnastics in its efforts to handle the case. When racial classification was de rigueur for determining which citizens were afforded which rights, the state could not tolerate ambiguity. There was more than one man's paternity involved, as South African whites had to deal with the reality that many of them had black blood - the legacy of liaisons, consensual and otherwise, between the early Dutch settlers and the native population. Could this Boer original sin have come back to haunt Sandra's parents? The courts and some scientists thought so, perhaps reaching for a face-saving way to deny an act impossible to countenance, and Sandra was officially classified as white.

The situation would be comical if it didn't have such drastic consequences. In South Africa of the 1960s and 70s, people went to court to have their race changed - that is, to alter the racial category on their identity cards -- from black to colored to white. It wasn't a matter of trying to ""pass"" as another race. Race, in apartheid South Africa, had its privileges - from the street where you could build a home, to the school you attended - even to the kind of food you were allowed when in prison. No wonder that with stakes this high, people would fight ferociously over their racial classification.

In Sandra's case, the controversy came at a high price. Her identity as a white clashed with her appearance, court findings notwithstanding. Her struggles - with rejection, humiliation, poverty and violence - turned a beloved and happy child into fearful, shy and reclusive adult. Though she was able to harness her inner spirit to bring something positive out of tragedy, the scars of abandonment and self-doubt remained.

The film's one weakness as that it played it safe, steadfastly refusing to make conclusions about Sandra's race or the possibility of her mother's extramarital liaisons. The horros of apartheid were only hinted at. But given those constraints, the acting in ""Skin"" was superb. Alice Krige and Sophie Okonedo (playing Sandra as a child and an adult) captured the many facets of this complex story. Sam Neill played her double-natured, both in love with his daughter and insistent that she conform to his prejudices.  Skin is a fine film that, while pulling back on the horrors of living with racists in a racist society, explores the way that the hue of one's skin literally colors a person's destiny and their level of acceptance in society.

Given our world's current struggles with dark-skinned ""terrorists"" and ""illegals"" and a part-white, part-black American president, the time is still ripe for an examination of a topic that is literally skin deep",1341705600,,4114,4.902298850574713

The life of Sandra Laing coincided with tremendous change in her country. She was smart, well-behaved, and properly raised by her parents. But Sandra had the misfortune to look ""colored"" at a time when South Africa was sharply divided by race.

Her father tries hard to get her into a good school. The school quickly rejects her because of parents' complaints about her skin color. Mr. Laing fights the government to get her classified as white. The law states that someone is white based on their appearance rather than the color of their parents. It takes many years, but eventually she is reclassified from colored to white.

At age 16, Sandra falls in love with a black man, a relationship which jeopardizes her status in life as well as the safety of her family. She defies her father and runs away with the man, eventually bearing him two children.

What happens when it is real?

In 1955, a girl was born to her white parents in apartheid South Africa.  Sandra Laing enjoyed the privileged life, until, because of her darker skin and black, curly hair, she was recategorized as ""Coloured.""  This new label affected everything in Sandra's life... where she could go to school, which drinking fountain she could use, and who she could kiss.

Her parents fought vigorously against this label, and eventually got Sandra recategorized as White.  But the effect on Sandra was long-lasting, and that is the basis for this true story.

A hard movie to watch.  Oh, where is our humanity?",1332547200,,909,5.833333333333333
4063273,5,B00336V4DU,"I guess for a long time to come films will be made about apartheid in South Africa: in its devastating consequences for all people involved even long after it is declared illegal. ""Skin"" holds up a blinding mirror to show apartheid's incendiary damage to just one family.

Pa and Ma are your typical Afrikaner family--white, middle-class, with eventually three children. Typical becomes atypical with the birth of that first child--female and definitely not white, but definitely theirs. Pa, played sternly by Sam Neill, goes through legal precedent to have their young daughter, Sandra,  declared ""white."" It seems that geneticists had already begun their study in the occasional birth of ""black"" children into ""white"" families. So, African Sandra appeared, Afrikaner she was proclaimed.

Can you imagine Sandra's dilemma growing up? Legally white, but with the visible stain of the legacy of racist society reminding her at every turn that she is an enigma? At her graduation her parents seek out a potential husband for her. Each white man knows she is ""white"" but treats her as she looks to him. Meanwhile, fully feeling her contradictory status, Sandra falls in love with a local African who does business with her father in his produce store.

Can you imagine Sandra's pain at choosing between her birthright and her physical calling. Sophie Okonedo plays Sandra's pain with perfect pitch. They have a baby and live happily within the confines of an African village, one of the makeshift kind on the edge of white society. But it's home and finally, Sandra is welcome and happy.

Can you imagine Sandra's pain to learn her father burns every iota of Sandra out of their lives. She chose black instead of white. He could not bend his racist heritage to accept an African into his family, although by skin, his daughter has African heritage. No, no, legally, she is white.

And, thus, we meet the ugly fist of racism in just one of its myriad forms. Whether it is apartheid in South Africa or slavery and the aftermath of the ""end"" of slavery in the United States or whatever form it takes across the world, racism is ugly, vile, destructive, and ultimately, incendiary, as is the symbol of fire eating up all traces of blackness out of Pa's household. Sam Neill's character has white skin, the good skin, the skin of acceptance and dominance and all the good things of life. Sandra chose the other. That was unforgivable.

There's more, of course, to this story, a true story, but I have given enough of an introduction to its whole. Just as Americans have made many films, written many books bout the ugliness of racism in their own country, to try to explain it away, to understand it, to finally acknowledge it, South Africans are working through their own ugliness.

4063278,5,B00336V4DU,"On the recommendation of some Nigerian friends, my wife and I grabbed a copy of ""Skin"" and sat down for a Saturday evening movie. We expected good things, but we were bowled over by the deep questions and emotion in this film, based upon the true story of Sandra Laing growing up in South Africa during the time of apartheid.

Sandra looks black. Which means she cannot be in a relationship with a white or even shop in the same store as the whites. But here parents are both white, and her mother swears that she has never been unfaithful. As Sandra heads to school, the color of her skin becomes an issue for students and parents, not to mention a heartless school master. Sandra's father vows to fight for her, and indeed the question of Sandra's identity is taken to the supreme court, where they judgment decades ago was based solely on appearance. Sandra is classified ""black,"" but later, when genetics and heritage became the standard, her classification is changed to ""white.""

The problem is that Sandra now finds herself in love with a black man. Her father is outraged and goes to extremes to stop the relationship. Her mother seems to be on her side, but then turns against her, stuck between an angry, violent husband and their grown daughter. Sandra is forced to make choices, more than once, that deal with heritage, color, identity, and family. Does love cross these lines? Does love erase these lines?

In the end, ""Skin"" is a powerful movie, told with honesty, grace, hardship, and a cast of fantastic actors. The emotions range from humor to horror to sorrow to muted joy. It is a story that reminds us not only of the injustice of apartheid and racism, but of what it means to be human. I highly recommend it.",1315612800,22,1729,4.607142857142857

4063280,5,B00336V4DU,"Too few of us realize the atrocities of Apartheid, a social and political policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by white minority governments in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. 'The term apartheid (from the Afrikaans word for ""apartness"") was coined in the 1930s and used as a political slogan of the National Party in the early 1940s, but the policy itself extends back to the beginning of white settlement in South Africa in 1652. After the primarily Afrikaner Nationalists came to power in 1948, the social custom of apartheid was systematized under law. The implementation of the policy, later referred to as ""separate development,"" was made possible by the Population Registration Act of 1950, which put all South Africans into three racial categories: Bantu (black African), white, or Coloured (of mixed race).'  Yes, everyone knows the story of Nelson Mandela and the end of Apartheid, but too few of us recognize the appalling effects of that system on the peoples of South Africa.  This true story should alter that and perhaps bring a higher degree of respect for those who survived that ugly system.  Based on the book 'When She Was White' by Judith Stone, Anthony Fabian wrote the story (with Helen Crawley, Jessie Keyt  and Helena Kriel) and directs this terrifying but ultimately triumphant film - a story we shall not soon forget.

Abraham and Lannie Laing (Sam Neill and Alice Krige) are Afrikaans who live and work their general store in the countryside with their two children Sandra (Ella Ramangwane as the young Sandra and Sphie Okenedo as the mature Sandra) and Henry. The Laings have sequestered themselves because their daughter appears black. Abraham constantly defends the 'whiteness' of his daughter at every level of the government and finally the Laings obtain admission to private white school for Sandra and Henry.  The school quickly dismisses Sandra because she 'is black', is beaten by teachers, and the school calls in doctors and other government support to back their opinion.  But through the tireless efforts of Abraham he finally gets a certification of Sandra's 'whiteness'. Sandra faces intolerance from the community but finds solace in the attention of a 'kaffir', Petrus Zwane (Tony Kgoroge) and in time the frustrated Sandra accepts the warmth of Petrus and they fall in love.  Abraham is furious and casts Sandra out of his home: Sandra and Petrus move into a black village and have babies until the whites demand the land on which the blacks are living and destroy Sandra and Petrus's home.  Petrus turns to drink and blames his loss of all his goods on marrying a 'white girl': Sandra and her now three children move to Johannesburg to find safety and employment, having been rejected by Sandra's parents.  When the Apartheid is banished Sandra becomes a spokesperson for her people and her country because she 'never gave up'.

In this history of the Apartheid the impact is made so very much stronger by the fact that the film shows both sides of the struggle - from the white viewpoint and the black viewpoint.  Sandra's father may have fought against the prejudice but when his daughter accepts being black, he is as raw and prejudiced as the rest of the whites.  Sandra's mother (played with compassion by Alice Krige) maintains her love and support of her beloved daughter but by societal demands she must bow to her husband's wishes.  As Sandra Sophie Okenedo shines in a performance that is brilliantly three dimensional - she is an enormously gifted actress.  The entire large cast is excellent, recreating a period in history we can only hope will never happen again.  This is a wholly satisfying film.
