1367877,5,B00004XPQH,"I've seen this several times and finally purchased the videotape. This movie has a wonderful score, and beautiful scenery, but I think anyone can relate to the portrayal of people who have outgrown their previous identities and have to refind themselves.  Steveston in the film is a little bit unbelievable, with everyone so helpful and kind, leaving only the principles (Sally Field, Judy Davis and Carly Pope) to battle their dysfunctional selves, so that is rather unrealistic, but the film is so seductive in its message of healing and hope, that you can overlook that. BTW, the book the movie is based on has a very different and not pleasant ending. I think the movie is better.",1161043200,7,684,4.846153846153846
1367878,5,B00004XPQH,"I found ""A Cooler Climate"" to be a delightful film. The film is about a woman, whose a recent divorcee and gets a job as a housekeeper. Sally Field plays the recent divorcee and housekeeper to another well-to-do woman (played by Judy Davis), her employer and they soon begin to realize that they have more in common than differences. They're both unhappy for different reasons, but begin to develop a friendship.

The basic premise of the movie is about a well-to-do divorcee, Sally Field, who realizes that sometimes life isn't always the way you intend it, but you can make the best out of a difficult situation.

If you enjoy movies that are entertaining, somewhat dramatic yet inspirational, then I would highly suggest this to anyone whether you're a man or woman because everyone can learn from Sally Field's character.

*(Recommned for older children and adults due to profanity and some of the adult themes such as divorce, marital infidelity being mentioned, etc.)*",1137801600,6,974,4.96319018404908
1367879,5,B00004XPQH,"Having come from a similar working relation as the character Sally Field portrayed in this movie was therapeutic.  The first time I saw it on TV, I felt like this movie was made just for me.  I reflected on my own experience and in doing so allowed the healing process to begin. After viewing it again recently it reminded of the turning point in my professional career and I knew it belonged in my library.  It might be hokey to some people, but, I just love positive, uplifting, happy endings.  Plus the scenery was absolutely beautiful.",1126569600,2,539,4.583333333333333

1367881,5,B00004XPQH,"I give this five stars, not for it being an incredible film, but for it being a film which entails so much more than most films made today.  I keep hearing people mention that it's the kind of movie made for older women.  My response is...whatever.  As a twenty yr old who watched this film with a male friend who makes hip hop music, I can say it's a film for everyone alike.  We both felt the characters had so much depth and all were highly interesting as people.  It's enjoyable and it moves at a nice brisk pace and regardless of some people say, it's a person movie, not a female movie. You don't have to wait for girl's night out, you can watch it with anyone who likes good character development and an interesting look at life from a new angle.  Judy Davis is excellent.  The movie only suffers from the fact that time is taken up with an unnecessary love interst for Sally Field...and wastes the time they could have used giving us a more solid understanding of the final relationship Field's character and Davis' character have developed.  Ah...what they do for poignancy.",994982400,16,1083,4.489795918367347
1367882,4,B00004XPQH,"This movie was produced by women, for women, about women.  It was made for Showtime and is clearly targeted at women in the 35+ age category.  It is a good character study of two women and their stormy relationship as employer and housekeeper.  Iris Prue (Sally Field) is starting a new life.  She divorced her husband and abandoned her comfortable life to seek love and fulfillment with her paramour.  Unfortunately, after she gave up everything, her new love didn't work out.  She seeks employment as a live-in housekeeper, and she is hired by Paula Tanner (Judy Davis).  Paula is an angry, rude and oppressive woman, who goes through housekeepers faster than she goes through laundry.  Iris is desperate to keep this job because she has nowhere else to go, and dutifully endures Paula's condescending abuse.
Paula disaffects everyone, so it is no surprise that both her daughter and husband can't stand her.  Ultimately, her life unravels as her daughter runs away and her husband leaves her.  Iris, whom she has completely alienated, is the only person to whom she can turn for support.  The rest of the story revolves around their tempestuous relationship and eventual transformation.
Director Susan Seidelman (TV's ""Sex in the City"") keeps the story interesting, deftly avoiding bogging down, as often happens in such character studies.  Certain parts are very raw and real, capturing feelings only a woman would understand.  She is especially sensitive in portraying the difficulties between mothers and daughters.  However, though meticulous at capturing the deep emotions resulting from the characters' conflict, Seidelman rushes through the resolution to the point where Paula turns into a completely different person in the span of 10 minutes of screen time.
The acting was superb.  Sally Field gives a wonderful performance as the flawed and self-doubting Iris, who is determined to keep her life from disintegrating despite her foolish mistakes.  Field captures the complexities of Iris' character, a woman both desperate and proud.  As good as Field is, Judy Davis is even better.  She is arrogant, insolent and mean, but shows subtle signs that it is all to compensate for her deep-seated insecurity.  Her portrayal of Paula's depression and angry blaming of others for her own shortcomings is brilliantly done.
I rated this film a 7/10.  I enjoyed it, but I was disappointed by how Seidelman ties up the ending in such a neat little package, ultimately producing characters that bear no resemblance to the imperfect people that we spent so much time getting to know.  I believe that relationships can be transforming, but this requires an absurd leap of faith.
Women should see this movie with a female friend.  It is probably destined for a long run on the Lifetime Channel.  Most men won't get it, and they will probably need at least three bathroom breaks while blithely suggesting you keep the recorder running in their absence.  Save this one for girls' night out.",979516800,5,2985,5.082135523613963
1367883,5,B00004XPQH,"Both Sally Field and Judy Davis were nominated for various awards for ""A Cooler Climate,"" and watching the film, you can see why. Both actresses are exceptional in this excellent character study and about two different women who come together out of necessity, and end up becoming friends. Field and Davis work extremely well together and fuel each other terrifically...that alone makes ""A Cooler Climate"" worth watching...but add to that a very good supporting cast, direction and script, and you have a definite winner!",970790400,7,521,5.214285714285714
1367884,5,B00004XPQH,"This movie stars Sally Field, who plays a divorced woman that cheated on her husband. As a result, she lost everything she'd worked her whole life  to get, a fancy car, a beautiful home, a stable family life, the respect of  family and friends. She had a rude awakening when she went to work as a  housekeeper for an eccentric and unfriendly woman who could chill anybody  to the bone. Both women, even though they come from differnt worlds and are  experiencing different lifestyles, come together to find a very close  friendship. They almost reverse roles after awhile. What a good movie! I've  seen it about 5 times since it came out a year ago.",968112000,4,649,4.591304347826087

7926141,5,B00004XPQH,"I really enjoy watching this movie.  The story line is something that would be familiar to people who are going thru a change in their life or who are thinking about making a change.  Both actresses do a wonderful job with the characters they are portraying.  The storyline is universal and relatable to anyone who has had a long term marriage, relationship, parented teenagers,  and looking to feel loved.  The VHS tape works well but is showing signs of aging.  I am hoping that Cooler Climate will come out on DVD or at least be available to stream.  Update: 12/2017 Was able to purchase this film on a DVD format for all regions.  Purchased from a seller in Australia at another online store website.",1387843200,2,704,4.620967741935484
7926142,5,B00004XPQH,"A COOLER CLIMATE  (1999)  99 minutes
  Oscar winning Susan Seidelman directed this engaging story that was presented on the Showtime Network. The well-written script benefits from having Judy Davis and Sally Field playing a couple of unhappy middle age women that cannot come to grips with their circumstances. Sally plays a woman who lost her husband and daughter after she was caught in a dalliance with a younger man who took her to the cleaners. Brokenhearted and just plain broke, Sally takes a job as a domestic to a bitter upper class woman (Judy Davis) who has marital problems of her own. Judy is so abrasive you wonder how Sally does not quit after the first day, but she is so desperate to be employed she decides to absorb the abuse.
  Both the leads look great in this one. Judy, in particular, looks lovely wearing a couple of revealing outfits. This was a terrific movie for anyone who enjoys gripping drama and great performances. Showtime has presented a lot of terrific movies, and this is one of their best!",1382745600,2,1026,4.70391061452514
7926143,5,B00004XPQH,"I ran across this fine 1999 drama in the video store.  Sally Fields plays a woman who has left a dissatisfying 26-year marriage and becomes the housekeeper for a shrewish rich woman played by Judy Davis.  There is no drummed-up excitement here, just finely acted, human drama as both women deal with their own challenges with men, their daughters,  becoming self-governing human beings, and friends with one another.",1380499200,,416,5.088235294117647
7926144,5,B00004XPQH,"I've always liked Sally Field, and so when I saw this movie a few years ago, I thought it was a bit on the unusual side for her to take on this role.  To play a woman who has gone through a divorce and is trying to start a fresh, but with no money is going to be a sad story line to say the least.  But she carries it off quite well and does a very good job.  But the star of the movie in terms of acting skill has got to go to Judy Davis.  She does a marvelous job as the negative, sour , uptight female employer in the film.  Ms. Davis is just the opposite of Ms. Fields personality type in the movie and it is fun to watch the interplay going on.  Ms. Davis makes the film what it is, which to me is a fantastic little film.  It was not easy for me to find this movie, since I did not recall its name, but nowdays anything can be found online.  It was pricey for a used film, but I couldn't resist, since I select movies carefully based on my tastes, and this one is a definite cut above a typical life-time movie melodrama in my opinion.  Like I said, great acting if for no other reason than to watch Judy Davis get snitty quite a bit!!!",1375574400,,1142,3.866952789699571
7926145,4,B00004XPQH,"Ms. Fields inspirational and heartbreaking portrial of Iris helped me move past my own divorce. Not the best acting but a solid movie non the less. While I would love to own it, I can't for the life of me imagine why a VHS tape is $42.95 unless it comes with the VHS player.",1328140800,3,274,4.092592592592593
