7976783,4,B00007JLEG,"I had been holding off purchasing this DVD due to some reviewers' negative reactions of ""substandard, unsteady video done by amateurs"" or words to that effect.  Well, holding off was a mistake.  The picture is similar to, or worst case, almost as good as most other live opera recordings from the same era (mid '80s).  It is at least quite comparable to late '70s video from the Met.

Video was done by at least three cameras and all were on tripods ... so much for being unsteady.  I am not aware that amateurs bring multiple videocams into the theater and set up on tripods!  The picture is a little dark at times (much of the action is at night).  I agree the sound was recorded distantly and fades in and out to a degree.  However, it is still a great video to own and watch, and would still be even if there were competition, which there ain't.

The mid 1980s is actually my favorite era of Italian opera DVDs ... technologically advanced enough to get a generally satisfying picture and sound, and yet early enough that we don't have to worry about Eurotrash incursions.  Keep 'em coming, please!",1405209600,3,1102,4.52020202020202
7976784,5,B00007JLEG,"It is always more fun to listen to Blake when he is the romantic hero or the tragic rejected lover. He plays the villain here, in fine voice, and you may be almost persuaded of the character. Another difficult-to-find dvd. Add it to your library if you can find it.",1381622400,2,265,4.32
7976785,4,B00007JLEG,"Yes the color is hazy, yes the sound fades in an out, yes the camera is unsteady and odd effects occur but! But the music is beautiful, it's splendid, it's one great aria, duet or chorus after another, it's Rossini in top form. The cast is excellent in this recording. Lella Cuberli is a magestic Elizabeth. Her solo arias are rendered with precision and heft. In the ""Fellon, la pena avrai"" she positively melts the others with the flame in her voice. Then gives a Bette Davis flick of the wrist to jangle her bracelets in an imperious underlining of her anger. Wow! what high drama! Then comes the beautiful resolution of the opera with ""Fuggi amor"". This is a wonderful satisfying opera.
The costumes and scenery are an ""empire"" style with gold, white and pale blue to an almost Rococo effect. Inappropriate yes, but it is fun to watch. Since there is no other DVD available, this is worth the price for such a wonderful piece of Rossini.",1238457600,4,941,4.57396449704142
7976786,3,B00007JLEG,"I agree with the other reviewer that this is a visually substandard production. I can't be sure, but I think that this is due in part to the fact that it was originally an Italian TV production. The conversion from European standard to North American standard TV may in part be responsible for this. Sometimes this gives the illusion of dancing flames in backstage ""rooms"" reflected on a wall. You can tell how fuzzy the picture is when you see the crisp subtitles superimposed. Having said all that---I had a whale of a time with it, really enjoying the view of current Italian opera that we don't often see. It is due in part to the static display of some of the scenes that we get the chance to see the stage as if we were sitting in the seats that I can actually afford--at the back of the theater. The sets appear to be mainly canvas, but with such well-done perspective that you are drawn into them. It is as if Piranesi did the sets-a magnificent sweep suggesting unseen depths extending far beyond the back stage area. The singing seems first rate to my fan-view knowledge. My personal favorite is Rockwell Blake, a tremendous villain, but I detected no weakness. The sound quality seemed good, as well, played through my stereo. A quirky production, but one I will watch again, despite its technical weakness.",1197158400,7,1318,4.6127659574468085
7976787,2,B00007JLEG,"A wonderful score beautifully performed, but recorded to less than home-video standards.

Although an early opera, this is, in my opinion, one of Rossini`s finest scores. It has an abundance of melodies rarely encountered anywhere. As can be judged from the very poor recording, the performance was indeed very good.

The picture is hazy, all colours fading into a yellowish-brown.

The sound begins very badly, and actually gets worse as the opera progresses. I think that such sub-standard recordings should not be encouraged by the public, I`m really sorry I boght it...

5 stars for the music and performance, zero for technical quality.",1147651200,11,641,5.194174757281553
