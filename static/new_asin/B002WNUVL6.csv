4007775,4,B002WNUVL6,"It was missing some parts from the stand-up on TV. I have the cable version on DVR. I was a little disappointed that my favorite part of the stand-up was not on there. Other than that, GREAT!",1296518400,,191,4.1891891891891895
4007776,5,B002WNUVL6,This is one funny DVD.  I bought extras to give as gifts.  I would buy from this seller again.,1293494400,,94,3.8947368421052633
4007777,1,B002WNUVL6,"Not a single original premise to be found in this hour of stand-up. Roberts is an amalgamation of too many other African-American comics on today's scene -- all saying the same thing, all virtually telling the same jokes: bad breath, fat women, being ""up in the club,"" etc. Contrary to what he claims, Tony is not ""different,"" he even gestures, mimics, moves, dresses like the rest. One might argue that there's a dearth of originality in comics of all races, and I might concur. However, there simply appears, in my opinion, to be an over-abundance of cookie-cutter comics of Tony's tone of skin. I'd theorize them to be the inspired offspring of Def Comedy Jam (from back in the day).  I was initially hopeful and optimistic; I really did want to like this guy; he's pleasant enough, but damn: don't you have anything original to say? No? Nothing? Surely we can't all think EXACTLY alike! Surely our lives can't all LACK NUANCE! And surely our experiences, interactions, observations, interpretations and expressions as African-Americans -- they can't all be TOTALLY SIMILAR! (Or am I simply an out-of-touch ""sell-out"" for even posing such questions?! In actuality, no, I'm just a man, regardless of race, fiending for a fresh laugh, that's all!) Tired, typical, tepid comics like Tony Roberts ensure Richard Pryor continues to roll in his grave!",1283731200,,1348,4.9911111111111115
4007778,5,B002WNUVL6,"I've been a fan of Tony Roberts for more than 10 years.  Had the privilege of seeing him live at school during my college days and he ALWAYS BRINGS THE FOOLISHNESS!!!
If you like having  your gut busted...go on and purchase this DVD, if not, go on and purchase it anyway (then schedule an appointment to have your stomach hernia fixed).  As a comic, I'm a tough critic/tough to make laugh, but this DVD is so ""retarded"" I had to watch it in doses.
Only complaint is the interview with Tony Roberts at the end of the DVD is too short.",1275782400,,533,4.257425742574258
4007779,5,B002WNUVL6,"Man. Tony's energy is electric. You just connect with him on everything he says, whether you agree or disagree. Sometimes I was laughing at this jokes, sometimes it's just the facial reaction. He gives a performance of his ""Colonic Rap"" in the show where he's taking on Lil Wayne and it kills. I just feel good after watching this show because Tony really makes you laugh. I'd never heard of him before seeing this show, and I can't wait for his next special or to catch him at a comedy club in LA.",1274140800,,498,4.365591397849462
