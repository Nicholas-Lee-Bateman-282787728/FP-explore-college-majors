7975654,2,B00007F8OB,"The quality of video and sound of this DVD set is low like of its VHS original of 1986, but its unique scenes showing Picasso are not available else. Remastering would be beneficial. ""Picasso: Magic Sex Death"" is by far a better choice.",1194739200,,236,4.511627906976744
7975655,3,B00007F8OB,"Picasso: The Man and His Work (Parts 1 and 2) is a candy coated version of a the life and work of a volatile genius.  Little depth is given to the relationships with the women in his life - just the vague notion that used them as models.  Some of the film was repetitive or went on too long, some important aspects of the work are not even mentioned.  I had a hard time deciding who would be an appropriate audience; adults who have had any art history will be disappointed in the glossing of reality, high school students will bored by the repetition and younger kids will lose interest.",1192838400,4,588,4.327272727272727
