4055701,5,B0032D5ESA,"I am currently 39 minutes and 28...29...30...31...etc. into this film and let me be the first to say it is fabulous!!! First of all, I've never seen a more aesthetically pleasing cast. Beautiful human beings! I never seen a movie that made me want to get on the roof of my house and nail gun my scrotal sack to my shingles. And that is the highest degree of admiration I can dispense. It really brought me back to my childhood, where on those warm summer evenings chained to a radiator, my father, who I later learned was merely a passionate lover who referred to himself as my father, but I digress, read me ""One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish"" which I later learned was the Bible, which later learned was merely a first hand account of his many lost loves, which was really a first hand account of him raping and killing a few hookers in Vietnam. Being a failed Japanese Kamikaze left a huge void in my life, ""August Underground's Mordum"" has filled that void. I've never felt more alive and at peace with the world.

On a side note, although the content may be just a tad over the heads of my two toddlers, I thought it would be a good growing up experience for the two apples of my eye. Which is fitting, considering the film is literally several inches over their heads, which are mounted just underneath my television.

4055702,2,B0032D5ESA,"I had read this was on a very disturbed list. You can only get online, so ive seen, i purchased it, couldn't even watch it all. If you have a strong stomach and can stand watching some very gross scenes and even throwing up in othrs mouths, then this is for you. I don't plan to attempt to watch it again",1298505600,,304,4.0
4055703,1,B0032D5ESA,"This movie is unbearable. It's ridiculously gross and obsene and while I understand that that was the point I still see no value in recommending this movie to anyone. The ""movie"" also seems to have no plot to speak of, nor is there any character within the characters of this movie. I can't describe the movie: it's impossible. But i'll say this: if your goal for entertainment is to be competely repulsed then by all means watch away. Beyond that this movie has no redeeming qualities. It tells no story. It's supposedly meant to be artistically shot on a handheld camera but it makes what your watching grainy and often unfocused. And last it's pointless. It has no relevance to the world of horror, suspence, or thriller films.

...

I'm unsatisfied with what is written above. So I'll add this: I regret watching any of this movie. Often I found myself skipping minutes ahead to see if it would ever start to make sense. It never did and now I'm left with a nightmarish image of one of the last scenes of the film. The scene portrays both acts of necrophilia and paedophilia. Now because of the method in which I watched the film I caught only the tail end. But it was enough. This movie needs banned or removed from shelves. I'll never say that about any movie I see or book I read but this film deserves to be deleted from history.",1294444800,6,1337,4.475409836065574
4055704,4,B0032D5ESA,"Way over the top extreme gore. More disturbing then the first film August underground. Again no real plot to the storyline just a lot of killing and blood and gore. This time theres a new comer who comes along for the killings.
fred vogel does a great job with hes second film in the series. the specail effects are awsome.

4055705,1,B0032D5ESA,"This movie was soooo stupid!!  I like gory movies, but this was soooo cheesy.  Yeah there were disgusting parts in this movie but they were so badly done that it just seemed kinda comical.
The special effects were cheesy, also was the acting, and I was so tired of the hand held camera just shaking back and forth.  Please rent this if you are still interested in seeing this film, don't buy it.  Its way too much money for a film so ridiculously done.  U will regret it when you're done watching the film.
If u like low budget cheesy movies than this is for you.  But don't be surprised if you are highly unhappy when its over.",1284940800,7,628,4.279661016949152

Bad acting
No direction at all
Just mindless killing without any motive.
And Terrible, TERRIBLE camera work. Not the fact the it's filmed on a standard home video camera, I can tolerate that, but because they can not hold it still. The constant camera movement made me want to puke more than the gore did. The special effects are about the only thing it has going for it.

4055717,1,B0032D5ESA,"This movie just sucked! I love gore! Love horror! Martyrs, Inside, Grotesque, even Salo was hard to follow but it had a story line. This movie was just so extremely pointless! The acting was crappy too and the characters, just pointless. The first few scenes were like, oh that's pretty wicked and then it just dragged and dragged, same thing over and over. Even a hardcore porn is freaking awesome when you see some girls barfing her insides out on some dude's junk while it's jammed down her throat and another sl** is underneath eating the throw up, shocking and interesting, can't look away! But 15 minutes of the same scene over and over, it loses it's value and it's just gross now. I wish I could give this film 0 stars, this is just stupid, cheap, horrible acting, pointless and it's not even that gory, all the parts that could've really been gory are hurt by crappy acting, no budget and a lack of effects. Don't, don't, don't waste your money.

4055718,5,B0032D5ESA,the third august underground film of fred vogel. still better than the first an just as good as the second. perfect to complete the collection,1363305600,,142,4.72

4055720,1,B0032D5ESA,"ok lol....lets get started.  my ultimate quarell with the dribble i saw a while back really has nothing to do with the content.  first, who uses the word f*** that much?  these people are fully grown and hopefully educated in some way or another so don't scream out the same word(s) over and over for 70 miserable minutes.  the movie CLAIMS the credit of the script to 5 writers...cmon guys, please get a dictionary or attend 1st grade to enhance your braindead lexicon.  another issue i have with this morbid abomination is the fact that SERIAL KILLERS...SERIAL KILLERS....SERIAL FREAKIN KILLERS walk the streets in packs in broad daylight under the view of people in public places.....does anyone reading this rant understand me at all??  the city (pittsburg?) they live in must have the laziest law enforcement ever... i mean , who kills 15 people and never even hears a siren?  or better yet, all these victims are young so perhaps some guardians of some kind would at least put thier missing little butterface on a walmart wall under ""have you seen me?""
wow, im really starting to digress...but...what i want to say is:  fred vogul, i really admire your special effects and how well you guys TRIED to take your roles seriously, but most shock ive seen over the years has indeed shocked me due to the realism as opposed to the gore.  most men would agree to a most painful death (in a certain death situation nontheless) than to separate themselves from thier beloved john thomas....and im trying to think of a punishment that is worse.  but fred, keep the gore (i myself enjoyed it) but add a more realistic tone to answer the loopholes your viewers are conjoring whilst watching your movies.  if you do that, along with possible acting lessons, you may one day be engraved in the annals os exploitation history as the man who made a gorefest provocative....cheers",1350086400,2,1869,4.755417956656347
4055721,5,B0032D5ESA,All I have to say is if you are a gore fan and you want to see what really happens in the real world of humanity when they are killers and how one type of killer needs to b tooken out by society after what one of the killers do to a person at the end. People lie to thier selves every day but shit like what happens in this movie is just a touch a reality of shit that really goes on right next door to you. buy this movie love it like it watch it.and you will have to also**** buy august underground part 1********* and august underground penance******* a have to have gore collection******* you will probably want to sell most of the crap you thought u had that was good gore after you get all three awesome realality better then a movie cant put my tounge on it you will have to buy to find outtttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1346025600,,819,4.125
4055722,1,B0032D5ESA,"On all these lists online, people credit this as being ""the most disturbing movie ever"".  Well, they're wrong, at least in my opinion.  Yes, the content in theory is depraved, inhuman, etc.  However, the thing is is that the ""found snuff film"" the director was going for is what ruins in entirely.  It's out of focus, terribly shot, and just hard to watch becuase of it.  There's also this constant whining or screeching sound in the background that will quickly grate on your nerves.

I'll give the FX guys, credit though, the gore and torture is well done for being shot on a VHS camera they found in a dumpster behind the KFC.  Even that being said, if you can stomach the violence, you'll have to sit through the most boring hour and a half expoitation film you'll ever see.  I found myself skipping forward in the film, not because I needed to get past the ""disturbing"" bits, but because I wanted to get to a part in which SOMETHING FINALLY HAPPENED, and then the film just abruptly ended.

There is seriously nothing to like about this film.  If you want realistic super torture then watch 'Martyrs', or if you want something to actually be disturbed by that isn't a total snooze fest watch 'A Serbian Film', or literally ANYTHING ELSE.

Oh, I do need to mention, I did almost vomit while watching this.  Not because of any stomach churning violence, but because there's a scene in the film in which one of the main charcters hocks loogies into their victims' mouths.  Which leads me to the vomit in this film.  There's a lot of it.

Just don't watch this movie.  It's not worth the time or money you'll put into this in hopes of watching ""The most disturbing film ever"", because there's always a lot worse you can watch.  You'll be more disturbed by ""Trash Humpers"" than by this film. On an out of print DVD version of the film, Rue Morgue (Which I've never heard of) states that it is probably a legitimate snuff film.  I can assure you it's not.  Not anywhere close.

EDIT: Oh, and to make matters worse, I paid around $22 for this DVD.  TWENTY TWO FREAKING DOLLARS!  That is straight from ToeTag, too.  If your REALLY do want this film, buy it from their website, since it's cheaper than on Amazon.",1339977600,2,2208,4.492462311557789
4055723,5,B0032D5ESA,"Ive seen many supposedly ""shocking"" movies. Serbian film, Human centipede, Salo etc. This film is on a completely different level. The people criticising the movie for its lack of plot etc are totally missing the point. The movie isn't trying to tell you a story or make some kind of social commentary, its trying to disturb and disgust you. Its essentially a collection of horribly convincing rape/torture/necrophilia scenes filmed with a handheld camera.

The gore is graphic and extremely realistic, while the off the cuff dialogue and believable acting (these guys REALLY get into the role) adds further to the terror. I consider myself a pretty hardened horror fan but I had a sick feeling in my stomach throughout and there were several scenes that had me absolutely recoling in disgust and horror. The murder/torture scenes are painfully intense, not just because of the gore but even more so because of the deeply disturbed (and disturbing) behaviour of the killers while they are committing these acts. These are some messed up people.",1336694400,18,1044,5.069767441860465
4055724,1,B0032D5ESA,"ok so what to do what to do, Iam a filmmaker with no story telling ability; ok there was a film called Blare Witch, that used the ""found footage' cool. I can shoot cheep and never have to set up a shot or worry about a plot or caricature development just boobs and fake blood cool. Ill be famous.  Three days later we have this stooped film.

Shot on shaky handheld video, this is not a ""study onto the minds of serial killers"" this is not ""follow a group of killers as they kill"" this isn't even a cool gore fest this is a boring stooped unimaginative piece of crap that would of worked ONLY in a film school as a final project, out in the real world no, no, no, it dosnt work its silly boring and dumb. It shows no promise of a future for the filmmaker and it certainly dosnt look real, it looks like a bunch of board friends who decided to make a film....well its not really a film, a film implys a certain level of production hmmm they made a video thats what this is not a film its a video shot on a weekend with no talent actors and no direction.

4055725,1,B0032D5ESA,"the first time i tried to watch ""august underground's mordum"" a few years ago, i had to stop after about ten minutes because it immediately felt like a pointless film that would've wasted my time. recently, i sat down to watch the whole thing through. i really should've heeded my first instincts. this movie is absolute scheisse.

these words are not written out of disgust with the shocking footage. (i'm somewhat desensitized to violence at this point in my life.) rather, this movie is just utterly boring and lacks any redeeming value whatsoever. there's no plot in this simulated snuff film. the badly acted one-dimensional characters just torture and kill people for no reason and that's basically the entire movie, aside from some random footage depicting the killers' everyday lives, sprinkled in to give the viewer respite from all the torture. there's no setup, motivation or direction to any of this. all the scenes are just spliced together with no real transitions. on top of that, throw in some loud annoying cursing, screaming and laughing all the time in place of a soundtrack or real dialogue. yeah. and then it all finally mercifully ends! i like horror movies, but this is not a horror movie. it is a trial to test your patience. if you're not easily shocked, prepare to be extremely bored. if you are easily shocked, then you'll probably turn off this film long before reaching the so-called ""ending"" for other reasons.

at least critics can praise the cinematography when they dislike everything else about a movie. well, not here. there's not a drop of ""cinematography"" to be found in this movie. the worst part is the shaky out-of-focus hand-held camera work. ugh. the washed out colors and grainy shots destroy much of any aesthetic appeal to the special effects. in short, this movie looks like crap -- crap shot on a broken camera, no less.

the movie that previously held the title of ""worst movie i've ever seen"" was the japanese simulated snuff film ""guinea pig: the devil's experiment."" i stopped watching that about ten minutes in as well. i didn't think it was possible, but ""mordum"" somehow became a new winner. congratulations are in order.

there's something about the dark side of human nature that has always been fascinating. it manages to revolt and attract at the same time. we seek it out to remind ourselves of the uncivilized animal we have been and could be still. if you wish to see man's inhumanity to man on film, try watching ""salo, or the 120 days of sodom,"" pasolini's interesting adaptation of the marquis de sade's novel. on the other hand, you could also spend some time watching the military channel to appreciate the positive aspects to the art and application of concentrated violence. however, if you must watch ""mordum"" out of morbid curiosity (like i did), try not to pay too much. there's a decent chance you will stop watching after the first few minutes, out of moral disgust, or out of sheer boredom.",1314144000,15,2964,4.828740157480315

8387413,1,B0032D5ESA,"This is perhaps the worst movie ever made. The second rate special effects were covered up by the poor video quality. This was done in an obvious attempt to make it seem more real but the trick simply did not work. Boring and pointless, there is no plot to speak of. Dialogue is non existent. Our 3 main idiot characters spend the entire movie laughing like hyenas and dropping the occasional F-Bomb. But after about 5 minutes of listening to these morons laugh and laugh I was thoroughly annoyed and really just wanted to put the TV on mute. Still, I stuck it out and watched this pointless, useless mess. Not sure how it gained any notoriety. It was not shocking it was annoying. It was not engaging on any level it was boring. Not artful, not disturbing, not anything but a time vampire. it sucked up a couple of hours of my life that I will never get back. A complete waste of time. A complete waste of money and rest assured I will avoid this director's future work.",1427328000,,971,4.4
8387414,5,B0032D5ESA,"If you haven't yet read my review for ""AUGUST UNDERGROUND"" please go check it out. This is the second entry in the trilogy and is by far the nastiest, sleaziest, and most disgusting. Nevertheless, it never comes off as forced or improbable. The movie looks honest and real for what it is. I give the actors/actresses an unspeakable amount of credit for this! I dare anyone to go through what they went through to make this film. And it might do good to mention that just because an actor/actress acts out certain things in a movie does not mean that that's what they do for fun on their own spare time. ITS A MOVIE!!! It's supposed to be honest and the cast was UNBELIEVABLY true to the characters created for the film. Remember people, not everyone is the same or thinks the same. We are all different people and there certainly are people out there like this so it's wrong to say that these characters are in any way not believable. The acting is as good as it possibly gets for what the movie is. Which is a ""found footage"" torture/exploitation/horror godsend. This is the real deal in underground extreme horror. Prepare yourself for the most disturbing movie you will ever see. And do yourself a favor and don't ever be caught watching this by anyone you care about or they will really start to judge your character :) enjoy and don't forget to watch the final movie PENANCE (the best in my opinion).

8387416,5,B0032D5ESA,"I briefly watched this a year or so ago, after maybe ten minutes I started to skip through it since it was just plain boring. Luckily, I gave it another go after reading all the acclaim and am glad I did. I'm hugely into horror and have been for a good portion of my life. It's also important to note for this kind of film that yes, I have a very strong stomach when it comes to this material.

It's a very low budget film, like a $300 type budget, so poor effects are to be expected. But I can think of plenty of theatrical horror films that have worse effects than this, so don't let that shun you. If you're looking for a plot, this is beyond that. It's like personal video tapes filmed by serial killers. Personally, I believe the VHS tape like quality makes it all the better, It just feels authentic.

And the acting is definitely believable, I've seen quite a few stories online of people who believe this movie is completely real (it's one of the reasons this is so notable). But it's meant to be believable, and it truly is. I didn't see one break of character in the whole film, perhaps other's view of 'bad acting' is just based on seeing so many glamorized and top notch horror film actors.
