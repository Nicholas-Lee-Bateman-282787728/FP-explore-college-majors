 I love this dvd because they explain it well and is easier than French.

  I will recommend all three dvd to lots of people.

  Therefor I will give five stars.

8151701,3,B000JLSPTS,"Good learning tool. Simple to use, gets down to the basics and provides clear instruction. For the price, I would readily recommend it.",1365724800,,135,4.913043478260869
8151702,5,B000JLSPTS,"A native speaker clearly presents what material will be covered.  It presents basic conjugations in video and audio.  This is not an entertainment, conversation based program.  It is more like classroom instruction at an easy pace.  It is a good supplement.  It is like having a tutor sitting next to you in your home.  I am a high school student who loves to learn Spanish.  I found this helpful.",1311638400,,397,4.666666666666667
8151703,5,B000JLSPTS,"Like the other DVDs in this series, Level 3 looks like a voice-PowerPoint similar to what a professor uses in a college Spanish 1 class.  Level 3 teaches verbs and conjugation.

Level 3 reinforces midsemester work in a 16-week, Spanish I, college course.  The many important irregular verbs, plus past and future tenses, and sentence/question construction, however, means this DVD includes more advanced information too.

An opportunity for memorization, drill, and practice is provided in this DVD--not entertainment.  I find learning verbs to be tedious, but by looking at the screen while listening to the speaker, I'm making progress.

A HUGE VALUE of this series is the speaker talks very slowly and clearly, which is unlike many language CDs on the market.  I can hear and imitate the speaker easily.

Also of value is that this series actually shows and pronounces the male and female forms instead of assuming the viewer can figure it out on their own.

These folks understand principles of language instruction.  I have all 3 DVDs and play at least part of one almost every day.  I rotate listening to Levels 1, 2, and 3.  Sometimes I listen for 5 minutes, while I focus on the DVD. Other times I play one for hours--as a background while I'm doing something else--so my attention comes and goes.

Learning a language requires dedication to learning thousands of words and details about how the language operates, and these DVDs make that process a little easier.  The series is a helpful tool when using a multi-faceted approach to learn Spanish.  This series helps in memorizing vocabulary, forming questions/answers, and verb conjugation, plus it helps in improving pronunciation.",1298160000,,1692,5.0577617328519855
8151704,4,B000JLSPTS,"I AM A SPANISH STUDENT WHO FINDS THIS SERIES HELPFULL. I PUT IT ON WHEN I AM TIRED OR EATING MY LUNCH. I REVIEW VERBS AND VOCABULARY IN A RELAXING WAY. I STUDY FROM MY TEXTBOOK, WATCH SPANISH MOVIES, SPEAK WITH MY NEIGHBORS WHEN I CAN. VARIED INPUT WORKS BEST FOR ME. I FIND THIS SERIES USEFUL FOR REVIEW. IT WORKS BETTER THAN THE STANDARD DEVIANTS. HOW MANY TIMES CAN I REVIEW WITH THAT?",1201046400,,388,4.256756756756757
8151705,1,B000JLSPTS,"This looks great on the cover, but all the person does is read a typewritten vocabulary and grammar review.  There are NO photos, NO video - only written material that is read.  It is so boring I almost fell asleep within 4 or 5 minutes of it. I have been teaching for more than 20 years and I guarantee a student who uses this DVD will never study Spanish again! I wanted to give this a 0 star, but that was not an option!",1180224000,,423,4.023809523809524
