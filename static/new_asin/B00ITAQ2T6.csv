6295783,5,B00ITAQ2T6,Love this show and Dennis Franz. Wish all seasons were available to order.  Please don't make us wait any longer.,1401840000,4,113,4.65
6295784,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"It is long overdue that somebody has finally decided to release these on DVD.  I hope they continue to release the subsequent seasons, because this remained one of the very best shows on TV, and quite possibly the very best cop show ever (""Homicide:  Life on the Street"" might give it a run for the money for that title, though), throughout its 12-year run right to the very end.

In my opinion this was the best show we could not get.  Now it seems as if this may be corrected.  I am glad.",1397865600,5,490,4.225806451612903
6295785,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"Have waited FOREVER for NYPD to start releasing seasons - again!  But because so much time has elapsed between the last season's release, I now only buy blu-ray.  Would give anything if the ""powers that be"" would release NYPD (the entire series) on blu-ray.  Glad to see this. Happy for those that will/can buy this.  But I won't purchase any more seasons until blu-ray is available.  Same with ""Elementary"" ""Longmire"" ""The Good Wife"" and ""Suits.""  A new ""smartphone"" every 17 minutes (I'll never own one. HA!), but we can't get blu-ray DVDs for our excellent television releases?  *Sheesh*",1397174400,2,590,4.959183673469388
6295786,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"NYPD Blue fans such as myself can rejoice! Season 6 is known to have arguably the most emotional episode ever in the history of the series. Our beloved Bobby Simone played by Jimmy Smits sadly passed on, and Ricky Schroder steps up to the plate to replace Smits. The mood and drama in this show has turned up a notch for this season. Many thanks to Shout Factory for reviving this series on dvd releases! I just hope and pray that they include the original 90 minute version of Bobby Simone's final episode, ""Hearts and Souls"" for this dvd release. The version of that episode on Amazon Instant Video is the shortened rerun version. I will most definitely pick up this season when it hits stores!",1395532800,20,696,4.531746031746032
6295787,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"NYPD Blue was firing on all cylinders throughout most of its run of 12 seasons.  Season 6 was no exception.  With Jimmy Smits out of the picture, Dennis Franz took up the torch and pushed this show through 6 more seasons pretty much on his own strength, an exceptional ensemble cast, and great stories.  I'm sure some folks might look at a release of a show this old and think, ""Why bother?""  but anyone who gives pretty much any season of NYPD Blue a shot will come away thinking, ""How did TV fall so far since making shows like this back in the late 90's/early 2000's?""  Rick Schroeder was not highly anticipated by many fans, but turned out to be a great addition to the cast and a well-loved partner for Sipowicz.  His character was as internally tormented as Sipowicz has ever been, and the show never faltered or suffered for his inclusion despite the misgivings of a lot of folks beforehand.  In short, this season will not disappoint, and if you've been collecting them all since Season 1 came out--HOLY COW--SEASON 6 is FINALLY COMING!!!  Bring on the rest, Shout Factory!!!",1395100800,32,1083,4.604166666666667
6295788,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"In tweeting back and forth with @ShoutFactory I knew this was coming before it was announced. I asked on a scale of 1-10 what are the chances? they said ""10ish"" Keep 'em coming Shout Factory!!! I finished season 5 within two days and was hungry for more! Season 6 was a huge turning point in the series with one of biggest tear jerkers of the series. Preordering now!!",1394496000,10,368,4.426470588235294
6295789,5,B00ITAQ2T6,It's great that Shout is releasing more seasons....I've been waiting too long for the series to continue after a long hiatus (since Season 4).  It's been unfortunate that Fox kept one of the best TV series ever made in vault somewhere...but better late than never.  Keep 'em coming!,1394409600,19,282,4.854166666666667

6295824,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"I'm glad somebody has FINALLY released this fine, fine series on DVD. This is a 'Plain Jane' version: it lacks the Special Features and fancy packaging, of the early Seasons, released by 20th Century Fox, in 2002, but it does have the original episodes, and that's what really counts. And, if I want to look t the Special Features, I can see them on my 2002 versions of Seasons 1 through 4.

This is the season in which we lose Bobby Simone, and meet his mentor, the retired prizefighter, Patsy Ferrara...where we get Patsy's version of the afterlife: He and Bobby release a pigeon, and watch as it disappears in the distance. Bobby hopes the pigeon will be all right. Patsy answers him: 'When a boid flies over the horizon, isn't she going home, and to be all right'?",1485302400,,768,4.525179856115108

6295826,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"I received Season 6 in the mail and was quite dismayed about the cheapness of the dvd box and materials inside. The plastic is opaque and very thin. It is not like what you normally get when you purchase a dvd.  The format is the old standard and not widescreen.

The picture quality is excellent but note that there are no subtitles. It does allow for closed caption reading so you can understand some of the words the New Yawkers say.

I am happy with the dvds themselves and that is the most important matter.  I am just surprised by  the cheapness used by the distributor of the discs.",1480723200,,589,4.36697247706422

6295865,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"This season along with 5 and 7 are my three favorite seasons.

But there is just something so magical and special about season 6.

The departure of
Jimmy Smits was hard to take at first but Ricky Schroeder did such and amazing job and had a wonderful transition into the character of Danny Sorensen.

I own the entire series on DVD yet find myself always going back to seasons five, six and seven as my most watched .

The only real "" let down "" for lack of a better expression was season 12.

Perhaps the show went one year too long because that final season struggled a bit.
I noticed it in the acting and the story lines.
Particularly additions like Bonny Somerville who was simply not believable At all as a detective made it slightly unpleasant for the first time.
Also curry graham as the new boss seemed somewhat forced - although he did have potential .

In any event, it's the greatest detective show in television history and
Steven bocco
David milch and
Bill Clark hit it out of the park year after year

1993-2005 I could always count on NYPD BLUE an hour a week for wonderful entertainment .

Season six still had most of the cast from the beginning ( season 2) .
Season one is an entire series in itself ..

Anyway you had

Greg medavoy
James Martinez
Arthur fancy
Diane Russell
Jill kirkendal since season 4
Andy sipowicz of course
And jimmy Smits send off and the addition of Ricky Schroeder

Also bill dornan ( Richard gant) was a great character in this season as were several other people you would recognize on TV today.

Each time I turned on my dvd, the disc would first start and for no reason stop, so I had to turn the dvd player off and then on again to get it to work. I am not impressed that Amazon buys these dvd's from Shout Factory. Season 1 & 2 you could turn it off and when you turned it back on, it brought it right back to where you left off. These do not. I am sadly disappointed in Amazon for buying from this company.

6295991,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"Finally!  A truly ""complete"" season is available, and a great one at that.  The season opens with what have got to be the finest episodes NYPD Blue ever did -- the final episodes of Bobby Simone.  Jimmy Smits simply does an outstanding job, and he does a lot of it with nothing more than his facial expressions.  He shows that it not always necessary to scream, pound on desks and throw stuff across a room to have truly great drama.  He did so well, and so subtly, a lot of people didn't notice the great job he did as an actor.
Danny Sorenson was an interesting character.  I would put him as my fourth favorite behind Simone, Sipowicz and Clark.  I think they did err a lot with his development, and of course Rick Schroeder left before they were able to delve into and explain his quirks to us, but he did give a bunch of good episodes.
The best feature of this is the episode - Simone's finale -- ""Hearts and Souls"".  It originally aired as a 90 minute episode. On  Amazon Instant Video it was available only as a horrid ""syndicated"" version, which ran only 45 minutes (without commercials, it runs just over 64 minutes).  This meant that an entire story line had been edited out, along with ruining the pacing of the episode.  It also eliminated a lot of scenes where we go to see how Bobby situation was affecting the rest of the squad.  With the DVD finally released, we get the entire episode in all its sad splendor.  The actors all around did their jobs so perfectly, with such grace and so seeming ease, that we can forget they are acting.  By the end, its as though we've actually lost a friend in Bobby Simone.

The DVD itself is true quality. Sound and picture are as good as the first four Seasons were, as released by Fox.  I'd been waiting for this for many years.  Now it's finally here!  I'll be watching it forever!",1418947200,5,1836,4.3657817109144545

6296036,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"I agree with most of the other reviewers here that Denis Franz is the star that makes this drama shine so brightly in the television firmament.  But who, or what, gets the nod for 'second place'?  The nominations are:

Gordon  Clapp, the usually unsung 'second banana' of the series, there from first season to last and brilliantly portraying the fumbling, sometimes brilliant, and always malapropos detective Medavoy who is Andy Sipowicz's favorite foil.

The Casting Crew who put together Le Tout Ensemble of guest stars and cast members who frequently take multiple roles...the greats like Leland Orser, Bill Smithrovich, and John Billingsly prime examples of the latter...and handle all of them brilliantly. And let's not forget the 'one shot' performers who returned in their roles or in new roles to become long-running co-stars: Charlotte Ross (Connie McDowell/Sipowicz), Lola Glaudini (Dolores Mayo), Richard Gant (Bill Dornan and others), Willie Garson (Henry Coffield) and Bill Broctrup (PAA John Irvin) most notable among them.

The Set Crew who created from their imaginations and a few film clips shot in NYC those imaginary places from the high security apartments of the very rich to hobo jungles under the bridges that left no doubt in our minds we were 'in New York' rather than on a set in Los Angeles.

And last but certainly not least the writers and creators, most notably the genius of Bochco and Milch with the authenticity supplied by Clark, who managed to bring every possible lifestyle to be found in The Big Apple into our living rooms, presenting most of them with a view to avoiding censure for the lifestyles as such while vilifying their participants who broke the law.  To be sure there might be some cult living in obscurity in a Queens loft that missed their attention but I seriously doubt it.

And which of these nominees will take home the award?  I say All Of The Above.

To be sure the series had its smutches...most notably the two occasions when the show strayed 'off purpose' --allowing the operating room (Bobby Simone's long, drawn-out demise) or the courtroom (Capt. Fraker's trial) to intrude and leave us feeling we were watching ER or L.A. Law rather than NYPD Blue...but taken as a whole these distractions were minimal.

My Personal Favorites (in addition to those mentioned above) in no particular order:  Emily Bergl as the brave rape victim, K. Todd Freeman as Arthur Cartwell, Dan Hedaya as NYPD Lou.  Personal Heart Throbs (in descending order):  The very beautiful Sharon Lawrence (Sylvia Costas), Lourdes Benedicto (Gina Cologne), and  Tamara Tunie  (Lillian Fancy).",1410307200,3,2623,5.048723897911833

6296059,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"First off, a huge THANK YOU for the release of more NYPD Blue on DVD.  It took almost eight years between Seasons 4 and 5, but 6 is already out and 7 is set to be released on September 30, 2014.  I can only hope they'll continue with the rest of the series and go up to Season 12.  Amazon made them available on Prime Instant Video a year or two ago, but I've longed for new DVD sets for years.  My only slight disappointment is the exclusion of any kind of special features, but I didn't really expect any after it took so long just to get more seasons of the show released.  Now for a quick look at what's going on in Season 6.

NYPD Blue was always keeping its audience on its toes with unexpected changes, new characters, and the relentless evolution of the character of Andy Sipowicz. Season 6 is no exception, as this was one of the most shocking (and highly rated) seasons in the show's run. Not only do the twists and surprises continue throughout these episodes, but they also tie into the progression of Andy's character as he assumes the full series lead after the departure of Jimmy Smits.

Anyone watching TV in 1998 surely remembers the publicity this show got out of the storyline about Bobby Simone's illness. Every day, the ads reminded viewers that the countdown was on for the exit of Smits, and the fans tuned in. After seeing ratings drop for three straight seasons, NYPD Blue nearly got back into the top ten with Season 6. As a heart condition relentlessly weakens Bobby, Diane and Andy must struggle with his inevitable loss. Dennis Franz and Kim Delaney both show incredible depth as actors as they portray the grieving process of their respective characters.

Season 6 is a difficult bunch of episodes for any fan of this show to experience with Smits deciding to leave and his character written out with such a painfully slow death. The shows are beautifully written and acted, with Bobby frequently having dreams/visions centered around his old pigeon-keeping mentor, Patsy. Smits, Dennis Franz, and Delaney all give tear-jerking performances that are some of TV's best examples ever of dramatic acting. The characters and viewers mourn the loss of a favorite character together, and the squad, just like the TV audience, is gradually led through the transition from Smits to Rick Schroeder's Danny Sorensen as Andy Sipowicz's partner.

The first six shows are emotionally very heavy, but the tone shifts back somewhat lighter once Bobby passes and Danny comes into the squad. Some funny moments pop up as the old characters respond to a new personality, Sipowicz in particular. I always thought Schroeder did a fantastic job in this role, offering a completely different character from Simone, but one who's compelling to watch for his own reasons. Sorensen is much more fragile than Bobby, but every bit as likable, as Diane soon finds out. The first hints at their future relationship are seen by the end of the season, but like the transition from one detective to the next, this is a gradual process. I'm a big fan of every season of NYPD Blue, but for obvious reasons, Season 6 is one of the most significant and important in the show's history. For any fan, these are must-see episodes.",1406937600,,3221,4.706927175843695

6296062,5,B00ITAQ2T6,One of my favorite TV shows ever....NYPD Blue still stands the test of time. Jimmy Smits exit from the show was so powerful and moving I dare anyone to watch it without reaching for the tissues. Dennis Franz shines as always. There is a reason this show won so many awards during its run.....for those of you who have not seen this stellar TV series do yourself a favor and check it out.

6296067,5,B00ITAQ2T6,"Simone dying, Danny Sorensen coming on & Dennis Franz  getting his casting credit first are some of the things that make this show such a pleasure to re-visit after all these years. Many of the crime stories depicted in each 45 minute episode (yay, no commercials) are lurid, occasionally heart wrenching & always entertaining.
Season 6, like the others that preceded it, just goes to confirm why I think this show is a bit better than ""Breaking Bad"" on my all-time top TV show.",1406073600,,478,4.690476190476191

Though it's a tough one to watch, I was so happy to see it again the way I hadn't seen it since 1998.

I won't purchase any of them until the entire series is available in a box set.  I purchased seasons 1-4 as video tapes years ago and waited years more to purchase the rest and they never released them.  SO frustrating and I think someones just playing games with it.

If you haven't watched the series, I'm not going to spoil it, but Episode 5 of Season 6 has only been shown in a butchered syndicated version for years. It originally ran as a 90-minute episode and through the years has been broadcast as a hacked-up 45 minute version. But finally, here it is in its original form - and I couldn't be happier.

8645339,4,B00ITAQ2T6,"Another viewer not dependent upon or used to the mature treatment of complex subject-matter by an ensemble cast would be distracted, I think because every conversation seems to end with a lingering shot by Detectives Jill, Andy and/or Diane. I try to just shake it off, cannot knowing-glance at myself. Their chorus plays against the ""mortals"" of the squad, whose perplexity and odd self-confidence humor or must be given a slant-neck or a shake of the head. Some stories need director's comments, missing, like why Saint Simone seems to hover great arms about the office and Danny Sorensen doesn't get it. Nothing he says can escape the fact no one has shared a word about who the detective was who died proud, knowing he'd flown birds and locked up some perps. Offered numb-brained Sorensen a Slo-Poke candy the others enjoy cocoa-richness, all day.

It's emotional haze when this is neither addressed, nor resolved. Danny invents a ruse to clear Det. Jill Kirkendall's son from witness testimony, stunning Diane who nonetheless immediately accepts co-credit. (This changes toward the last shows, but like Martinez they didn't have much at stake in the stories or their lines.) Things like this distract from the usual well-lighted wealth of perspective and interaction. Still great!",1516838400,,1285,5.148325358851674
