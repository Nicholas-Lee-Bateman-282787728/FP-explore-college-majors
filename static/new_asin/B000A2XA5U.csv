2353277,5,B000A2XA5U,"This is the Ah! My Godess the TV series originally aired in Japan in 2005. This series pretty much follows the managa. What happens when a college student wishes a Goddess to live with him forever? You get to see the fateful meeting of Belldandy and Keiichi in the first episode, then follow their adventures with friends and enemies, and finally reach the climatic ending with the Terrible Master story arc in the manga.

The region 2 DVD release is in anamorphic widescreen, eventhough the series was originally aired in a cropped, 4:3 format. Hopefully Media Blasters can get hold of the widescreen masters and give it the proper treatment.",1122249600,2,643,4.845454545454546

The TV series was originally aired in Japan in a cropped, 4:3 format. The Media Blasters release is in the original 16:9 format, just like the Region 2 DVD.

2353312,5,B000A2XA5U,"I think that other reviewers already covered most of things for this DVD. One thing I want to add is that the opening song is very cool too. The songs of OVA version of ""Oh My Goddess"" (NOT Ah My Goddess, they are same series but different version) are based mainly on midi music. Those OVA songs are quite popular and also pretty but I was always thinking that they could be better, if the producer invest more for the music. They did that this time! Actually, the movie version of Ah My goddess is the starter where they employed whole scale orchestra rather than simple midi synthesizer. If you watched the parody version of Goddess series ""The Adventures of Mini Goddess,"" you should have noticed the big jump up of the quality of musical background from the OVA version. Ok. Kind of confused of the different versions? The OVA version ""Oh My Goddess"" is the first series. It consists of two DVDs and the storyline is rather diverging from the original Manga book. But the theme and major tales are quite the same with sweety midi songs. ""Adventures of Mini Goddess"" series are composed of 4 DVDs and this is a parody of the original series emphasizing corny jokes and hyper cute caricatures of the 3 goddesses. The movie version of ""Ah My goddess"" is one DVD with a somewhat serious episode and the famous theme song ""Wish.""  And, this TV series ""Ah My Goddess"" consist so far of 6 DVDs with most orthodox storyline comparing with the original manga books. The opening theme song that I mentioned above is ""Open your mind"" is really beautiful. This first volume contains 5 episodes. They are mainly setting the ground for all following episodes. One thing I want to mention is that the title ""Always & Forever"" is the English translated term of the magic words that keichi told to Beldandy, ""Jutdo Sobani (literally forever & together)"" These two words are the most important words throughout the whole series. Actually, these words are the definition of the relationship of keichi and Beldandy and also for the entire series. Last thing that I want to say is ""don't hurry."" People want to see urd and Sculd, the two sister goddesses of Beldandy, right away. But urd comes just in second volume and Sculd does not appear until the third volume. Until then, in this first volume, you should fully enjoy the innocent sweetness of Beldandy.",1148256000,9,2342,4.670702179176756
2353313,5,B000A2XA5U,"Alright, it's cute and it's sappy and it's cheesy, but gosh darn it I can't help but love it. I just love watching Belldandy and Keichi together....

It's heart warming and it leaves me with a great feeling afterwards. I can just watch 'em over and over. A

I read the first few chapters of the manga, and after unexpectedly laughing and enjoying it, I checked out the OAV. This, was very very cheesy, and I quite frankly felt embarrased that I liked it (but I couldn't help it, I tell you, I still liked it....) Then I checked this out, and found to my wondering joy this new version... and fell in love with it. Sure it's cheesy, but it's not as sappy as the OAV. (And it has WAY better music!!!) BTW.. the movie is great too.  These really are great stories, and even with the occaisional  ""????"" episode, I love the series, and can't ever wait for the next one to come out so I can buy it as soon as it touches the shelves....

2353314,5,B000A2XA5U,"I won't totally recap the plot, others have done that all ready. I will sum it all up as a nice guy with a loser reputation gets a chance at the ultimate girlfriend. This has the effect of creating one of the most unusual, awkward, and sweetly enchanting couples I've seen in a long time.
The story is sensibly thought out, given the subject, with all the very real complications one might expect. The animation is very sharp, and the voice casting is dead on. The end result is as good an animated show as I've seen in any genre. I recommend this one very highly.",1140220800,,564,4.330188679245283
2353315,5,B000A2XA5U,To the point. The Art is consistant and well done. I like the way the first DVD takes off and keeps building on the story line. I enjoyed this more than the Movie. This is the type of story line I like so much I want to drink it slowly and not waste a drop. I wanted to find a series that filled my HAIBANE RENMEI (Worth Seeing!) attraction.  This Series starts off doing just that! Not Many Anime titles motivate one to post a review right after you watch them. I believe that supports why I gave it a FIVE!,1139529600,,508,4.02970297029703
2353316,5,B000A2XA5U,"I had originally bought this anime as a genre introduction for my wife and found it more enjoyable than I had expected.  Very refreshing and relatively innocent tale that is a delightfully sweet and humerous break from the more serious trodden paths of mecha, violence, intrigue, and death.  ""Ah! My Goddess"" can easily be likened to a much anticipated holiday and has found a niche of honor upon my modest anime shelf.  Cheers!",1137369600,,428,4.835616438356165
2353317,4,B000A2XA5U,"This show is exilent, don't get me wrong, but I really felt that a warning needs to go out to people that don't know much about anime.. -This is absolutly NOT the show that you've heard so much about-.. If your looking at this and thinking ""Oh, I've heard of this, maybe I should check it out!"" your probably thinking of: (Oh My Goddess (Vol. 1) (1997)).... -This is a Telivision show that was based on those OVA's-..

*Slight spoiler warning*

Actually, honestly, I very dissapointed in it, being a big fan of the original, as they have very little in common. The characters and locations are nearly identical, the story even starts out about the same, but they take drastic terns from each other a few episodes in.... Where in the original, hopfully not to spoil to much, The main characters are -forced- to sepperate, being the main story line. It creates an intence tragity/romance setting.... In this one a few episodes in, insted, a demon is released that wants to take revenge on the goddesses, as the main story line. It creates a very childish Adventure/drama enviroment.... And also, as the show progresses, nearly no romantic progress is made... Honestly, it's hardly even the same show, it's hardly belivable that they gave it the same name... The characters are the same, and the show is entertaining in it's own rite.. But it's NOT the romance/comady that I fell in love with 10 years ago....

2353318,5,B000A2XA5U,"Imagine my shock when I found out there was ANOTHER set of DVD's for this anime?  I had no idea there were any more in the works after the first two disks I got.  And I call myself a fan...(can you say disappointment to my friends and family, I feel the fool).

Anyway, I looked at this item on Amazon, looked pretty good.  Checked out the reviews, they seemed to think it was cool.  Still, being the ever so skeptical woman that I am (at least when it comes to anime), I decided to get it, figuring that if I didn't like it, then at least I had another disk to continue my collection.

THERE TRUELY IS A GOD(DESS)!!  The creators definitly have a winner with this one.  When the reviewers said it was as close and true to the mangas, they weren't lying.  The artistry is awsome, the plot seems better (not so 'crammed' like in the first disks), and the voice actors are the perfect match!!  Nothing felt like it was forced, and it drew you into the story.  I LOVED the special effects:  Heaven is MAGNIFICENT!!!! Personally, I think they should have used this one as the OVA rather than a TV series, but let's not split hairs here.

Anyway, there are 5 episodes per disk, more than on your standard anime DVD (that is unless you purchased other animes as sets).  The first disk deals primarily with just Keiichi Morisato and the Goddess Belldandy (sorry, no Urd or Skuld in this one yet).  For those of you who read the actual manga, then you know exactly what to expect (let's face it, the first disks of Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 did nothing for the manga, they simply crammed stuff onto two disks, that's the way I see it.).  If you haven't, then naughty naughty.  You should be punished.  Go to your local book store and do some research, because even if I did give you a play by play, or even a short synopsis of each episode, you wouldn't understand.  It would not only be a waste of my time, but your time as well.  (then again, is sending you to a store to read manga that much of a punishment?  I think not.)

I'm telling you, if you pass up the opportunity to own this, you're gonna lose out on some great stuff.  Seriously, it'd be your loss.  I already ordered the second disk and pre-ordered the next.  Can't wait 'till these babies arrive.

And to the creators, I bow humbly and mercifully at your feet...*smooch**smooch**smooch*.  All hail the mighty Kiroaki Goda, for directing such magnificant work!  And to Kosuke Fujishima, for without him this joy that I feel would never had been realized!",1135036800,2,2503,4.3826086956521735
2353319,4,B000A2XA5U,"I'm glad that this story is finally getting told the way it was meant to be. The previous OAV was good and had a lot of potential, but it was just way too short.

I gave this 4 stars only because of a couple of minor complaints about the series box and the style of some of the subtitles.

The series box on the bottom has an impossible to cleanly remove sticker...Would recommend to the manufacturer to use a stronger paper stock for the sticker and a weaker adhesive.

I was quite pleased with the size and color of the subtitles, they were quite easy to read. However I was annoyed with the western-style name changes (it's Morisato Keiichi, not Keiichi Morisato). I had hoped for translations of all Kanji and Hirigana seen, but there was almost none.",1132617600,,755,4.456521739130435
2353320,5,B000A2XA5U,"I watched the the original 5 episode OAV/OVA series and this series, this one is much better. In this one their was a bigger budget, more time to learn about the characters and see the relationship between Belldandy and Keichi, good music, and the artwork and animation is very well done.

I highly recommend this anime.",1132531200,2,320,4.714285714285714
2353321,4,B000A2XA5U,"I thought, YES, they're making a TV series based directly on the manga.  I love the manga and the OVA and the movie, so when I heard they were making a full length anime series I knew I needed to watch it.

And the episodes DO follow the manga.  In fact, Belldandy does not show up till most of the first episode is over - they really give Keiichi a lot of screen time to help build up his character and show us his life before she shows up.

In fact they seemed to follow the manga so well that there was nothing there to surprise me.  And it was kind of bland, neither really touching or very funny.  In fact, after watching the five episodes I couldn't remember anything that seemed to pop out at me.  None of the sisters even showed up yet and I love Urd!

The extras were interesting but the only reason I plan to stick with the series is I want to see Mara and how she turns out.",1131667200,5,885,4.017142857142857
2353362,5,B000A2XA5U,"I watched this earlier in the year, and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  I love Ah/Oh My Goddess! great anime.  This one is funny, the animation is great, and it really gives more of the story.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the origional five part, but this one is much better.  Highly recommended.

I also really enjoy the box that come with this, you have a nice place to store the whole series, and you can keep your cases in good condition.",1130198400,,461,4.193181818181818
2353363,4,B000A2XA5U,"As an Ah My Goddess fan, I was a bit worried to initially hear that the voice actors would be different than the ones used in either the OAV or movie.

But I am relieved now that I have experienced it for myself.  The voice actors in no way ruin the series and in my opinion do a very decent job.  Granted, Tamia's voice does resemble the Cookie Monster's voice, but even so it only adds a bit more flare to his colorful character.

The only possible complaint that I can give is that of the character drawings, particularly Belldandy's.  For those who have come to love the illustrations from the comics and OAV's, you may be a bit disappointed with the changes in the TV-series' character illustration.

Overall I'd say that this is a pretty safe and worthwhile buy for AMG fans.",1129507200,,781,4.426573426573427
2353364,5,B000A2XA5U,"*Points up towards 'you-know-where'*

Yeah, I own the whole shebang. Manga (started with Fourth Goddess), the OVA, the excellent movie, a Peorth figurine on my desk. Even wrote some fanfics and such using the theme. I'm as bad as any other Otaku of the series. Only Tenchi has a leg up on AMG/OMG! in my book.

A leg equal now due to this extremely well done, all but immaculate release of an old title. And it's 'about' time this series got the kuddos it deserves. The first disc alone is a testamite to fans everywhere.

Given the standards I personally looked for, for the new series, I was far from dissapointed. The theme of 'all' the previous works (even the OVA if you look hard enough..) found at least a minimum hint in the first five eppies alone. But the theme was the manga first and foremost, and there was 'no' mistake with the theme there.

And then, they did 'that' one better. After years of the feeling of: dial number for take-out, get wrong number, get REALLY wrong number, (add beautiful voice..), look back at mirror at the impossible, wish, yada-be my eternal girl, yada, life changes forever. I was very much relieved to see the creators take a far slower approach to it all. The first eppisode alone gives everything 'far' more of a justification, not to mention a decent amount of sympathy for the poor shmuck that ends up with the life changing event.

In fact, the next four eppies are just as drawn out, not so much to feel stetched, but to make it feel like it was a 'real' life event taking place before your eyes. The girl that Keichii helps in eppie 1, comes back to 'help' later in eppie 3, when a truly unwitting goddess uses her spells openly. (another seriously liked change, something of feel from the movie.) This all help create continuity that only the manga was really good for.

And still, the phrases used, the recognizable scenes, the moments that you can look up in the manga, and say, AHAH! So to speak.

Even using Koshan was a treat, if a painful one. =^^=

But it's not just the storyline that feels perfect. The graphics are as well. The campus is hufe in feel. The comedy of the 'guys' and themes of the 'oft expected' are too keen (especially when everyone learns that Bell and K1 are living together.) More, it even comes down to the temple itself. The scene in the hallway is all but the same as one from the movie. The feel of all elements combining is just what this series, the manga in particular, deserves.

As mentioned above, fan service was not at stake here, very well apparent, and it is this long time fan's hope, that the coming volumes, will not be rushed in anyway, down the road. But noting the size of the Dvd holding box, and the length of the plots involved, to see what kind of ending for the series they come up with.

Now we just need to wait and see how much akin Urd and Skuld.. (and Peorth, along with Mara, the Urn, Aoshima, Almighty, Chihiro, too many others to count...) ..are.",1128988800,2,2959,4.442804428044281

2353368,4,B000A2XA5U,"Ah! My Goddess is a wildly popular series that started life out as a manga before making the jump to anime. A 5 episode OVA series was released in the early 90s as was a motion picture. Now US distributor Media Blasters releases stateside the 26 episode television series that aired last season in Japan.

The series stay very true to the long running manga. For the uninitiated, Ah! My Goddess tells the comedic story of young Morisato, a struggling college kid trying to survive his schoolwork and at times his roommates. One day while trying to order takeout food he dials the wrong number and gets the Goddess Helpline. Enter beautiful and sweet Goddess Belldandy. Belldandy grants his wish which is that she stays with him. This simple action sets up a series of comedic and sometimes touching events as the two characters budding romance takes off. Morisato moves into his own place which gradually gets crowded thanks to Belldandy's relatives coming to crash and sometimes live. This anime has harem show elements but stays away from fan service, prefering to focus on the romantic/comedic events of the character's lives.

The latest TV series is really a visual treat. The character designs are a bit more angular compared to the original OVA series but the animation is fluid and the colours are truly brilliant. Musically the opening and closing themes are catchy. For voice actor fans the entire original Japanese cast has been brought back to reprise their roles.

2353370,5,B000A2XA5U,"So here we go again.  This long running (1988-present) manga series has been done in an animated format twice before.

The first being the fan-favorite OAV series.  While only five parts of the story are told in this adaption, and many bits of the manga are skipped over, the focus is more on romance.  A very good romance story indeed.

Then there was the 2001 full-length movie, which put even more emphasis on drama and romance, with hints of comedy.  This movie had some of the most beautiful animation I've seen to date, and the story told here is very touching, and it is sure to get a few fans, male or female, a bit misty-eyed.

If one doesn't count ""Adventures of the Mini-Goddess"" series, which was just a collection of comedy skits, showing all the crazy things the three Goddesses (Belldandy, Urd, and Skuld namely) do while Keiichi is away, this TV series makes it the third-go-round for animated Ah My Goddess.

For the unknowing buyer, this story is actually a fairly simple one.  The strengths of this series are in its strong romance plot between Belldandy and Keiichi, and all the comedic bits thrown in, especially once the other two Goddesses, Urd, the luscious one always trying to pull some little scheme to bring Bell and Kei closer, and Skuld, the smart, but slightly bratty one.  There's many others who come to disrupt the lives of the young couple, but that's part of what makes this series enjoyable.  Through it all, Keiichi and Belldandy undeniably have feelings for each other, which, when they 'are' alone, allows for the sweet touching moments to shine through in this series.

To me it seems the below reviewer has a bit of a biased disliking of dubs, so I'll give a more positive take, or rather, an outlook since this series doesn't street until the date above.

I've watched most of the anime I own in English.  Knowing Media Blasters, they tend to do a decent job.  The trouble is, Ah My Goddess ended up having two variations, since the OAV set was done by AnimEigo about 10 years ago, and the movie, by Geneon (then known as Pioneer) in 2002.  Media Blasters went and assembled an entirely new cast, making for a third English dub.  Some are fans of the movie recording, some of the OAV.  I liked both of those equally, but it would be impossible for me to form an opinion on this new dub until I actually get to see this.  From initial reviews I've been reading at other sites, the dub actually turned out well done, but again, I have to listen for myself.

Even 'if' the dub turns out to be a disaster to some ears, there is always the Japanese track for the purists.  I don't think fans of English-dubbed anime who are ordering this title right now should be too worried.  I've watched other Media Blasters titles in the past in English, and while mostly minor characters get some odd voices, the majority of the cast is a strong lineup, and do a good job.

Personally I'm looking forward to this release.  It's been a long time coming, and there's still so much manga left for this series to cover.  Here's hoping a 'Season 2' is forthcoming overseas.",1125878400,10,3095,4.543321299638989

Her older sister is bent on fast tracking Belldandy's relationship with Keiichi and her little sister wants to break them up. There are also demons and classmates that have it in for them.

This anime is adapted from an older, short OVA and manga. It is more detailed and takes the story further. The animation is great, the soundtrack is fitting, and the story is very good.

The OVA is also definitely also worth buying (if you can find it). In a very violent, superficial anime world this series offers a breath of fresh air with its charming warmness. I've seen the whole first season, and I have to say that this series is very good in terms of character development, storyline, and 'relatability'.

Music: The opening theme to this show, done by Yoko Ishida, is truly perfect for the series, and while there aren't too many BGMs, the ones that have been selected are great. Both the lyrics and the light, airy feel of the flute give the opening theme real character

Characters: There seem to be no 'filler' characters in this series, which is very good to me. Everyone who is focused on brings something different to the series, especially in the case of Belldandy and her sisters. The characters like the 'Sempais' who are added for a comedic element, do this very well, as most of the time I don't find comedic anime characters to be very funny. These guys were :D

Voice acting: I am a purist who listened to the whole thing in Japanese, so I can't comment on the english dub, however unless you hate reading subtitles I would strongly suggest watching in Japanese, as the voice actors and actresses are EXCELLENT and bring a uniqueness to their parts.",1298764800,,1456,4.613899613899614

BUT, I was pulled right in after the first two episodes. It's a great storyline with lots of humor and romance.
The box art is pretty and perfect for storing my other dvds. The little phone strap is cute too.
I highly recommend this series!",1199145600,,427,4.558441558441558

I recommend this anime to fans looking for a light-hearted show full of comedic situations, zany characters, and sweet romance.  I love the collectors box and this series will be a great addition to any collection.",1150934400,,276,4.708333333333333
