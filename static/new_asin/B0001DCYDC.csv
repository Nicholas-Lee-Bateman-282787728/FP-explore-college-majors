8010689,2,B0001DCYDC,"Tedious television movie about a woman whose life of idle pleasure is ruined with the death of her husband.  Injured in body and mind she soon fills her sleepless nights listening to the expensive scanning equipment her husband left behind.  This hobby, extensive physical therapy, and the over attentive condolences of her husband's business partner are Shelby's new life.

In short order she comes to recognize the voices and lives of the people she eavesdrops on.  When a local woman turns up missing under very mysterious circumstances, our heroine might hold the key to the mystery in her collection of taped conversations.  But was there really a murder? And if she helps to put an innocent man behind bars, what would a guilty one do to protect his secrets?

This was a movie that I just gritted my teeth through and waited for it to end.  The actors seemed to realize the triteness of the script and didn't waste any effort working too hard.  The plot was predictable and the beautiful panoramas of Boston at night were obviously Canadian.

It wasn't the worst movie I ever saw but it isn't one I'll be seeing again ever either.",1124582400,9,1136,4.725888324873097
