8553702,1,B00AMHFOBQ,"Just because you can make a zombie movie, doesn't mean you should. Before the zombies are created through a bomb, the TV and phones go out...but airplanes can still fly with their GPS. The film is low budget, lame, boring, bad sound, terrible acting, worse dialogue and virtually lacking a plot.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1441584000,,329,4.771929824561403
8553703,5,B00AMHFOBQ,"A great ""the world is getting infected with zombie virus"" movie. While that plot has been done, it hasn't been done in quite this way. I was glued to the screen...I love the style of this movie! I think any zombie fan will like this one, I certainly did.",1374969600,,254,4.204081632653061
8553704,4,B00AMHFOBQ,The whole concept of a zombie army is awesome. I popped this in when some friends were over and we all dug it. Good times.,1374710400,,122,3.92
8553705,3,B00AMHFOBQ,I was disappointed with this purchase.  Both the characters & the acting sucked.  There wasn't one intelligent human in this flick.  Every decision was a bad decision.  Sprinting zombies spoiled the film.  Everyone gets caught!  Boring!!!!,1367971200,,239,5.5
8553706,1,B00AMHFOBQ,"In a most deceptive fashion, Deadlands: The Rising (2006) has been repackaged as this steaming pile of dog doo.  If you want the former movie, you can buy it in its original form at half the price of this one brand new.

There is nothing on the packaging here that would lead one to know this before they had the disc in their hands and found out.  No information as to the stars, the director, or anything.  This is shameful.  There is no listing on IMDB or The Movie Database for this new one.  The original movie, mentioned above is located at: [...] , and while it may be a nice indie flick, I don;t appreciate having it foisted off on me as a new 2013 film.

The item has been returned for credit.",1364515200,8,702,4.1940298507462686
8553707,4,B00AMHFOBQ,"To me the template for all movies like this is Evil Dead. This indie flick does an admirable job. I don't know what it is about Zombie movies, but hey just never get old. If you're a zombie nut like me you'll dig this.",1362614400,,218,3.977272727272727
