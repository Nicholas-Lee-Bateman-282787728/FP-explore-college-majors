8532131,5,6302990017,The Hitch-Hikers is a short film based on a Eudora Welty story. It captures the deep south in the 1930's perfectly. From the music and dialect it all rings true. Patty Duke is Ruth a small town girl who is a part of it all. Worth your time watching.,1374451200,,249,4.1020408163265305
