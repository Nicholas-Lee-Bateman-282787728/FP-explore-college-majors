3968107,5,B002QW7ALW,"""Capitalism"" opens with disclaimer from some old film, and then segues into scenes from police videos of people robbing banks and convenience stores. Moore likes to make comparisons. In this case he wants to show us who the real thieves are, and they don't tend to be desperate drug addicts wearing hoodies.

To me that's what Moore's latest film is: a cinematic treatise on crime. Moore uses his excellent skills as an editor to piece together films in a manner that makes you want to scream ""Where does he find this stuff?"" to paint a telling picture of what America is: a plutocracy. And yes, Mike uses that word and wants us all to learn it, even providing a definition straight out of a textbook.

What Moore also excels at is humanizing crises and the class war by showing us just who's affected by these forces and why. We're shown people, real people being thrown out of their homes, being pushed out of their jobs, being paid meager salaries to do dangerous, complicated work, and being informed that companies profited from the deaths of their loved ones through something called ""dead peasant insurance.""

He even speaks to various clergy to try and find any sort of modern moral justification for capitalism. He can't. One priest even goes as far as to state flatly that ""Capitalism is radically evil.""

Yeah.

Speaking of all things radical, Moore puts himself on the line by trying to raid the offices of financial institutions, implores us to do the same, and backs that strategy up by showing current examples of how dissent and popular revolt can turn the tables on the gluttons in power, even if those victories are as small as one family being allowed to stay in their foreclosed home and window factory workers given severance payments after a long sit-in.

However, what ""Capitalism"" isn't is a mere bleeding-heart piece that is all emotion. Mike tends to do his homework. And that's what makes him a firebrand. The evidence is laid bare for the viewer to see.

There are some who would call Michael Moore and his documentaries ""anti-American."" He's even told by one Wall Streeter to ""stop making movies"" when trying to get an accurate definition of what are called ""derivatives.""  Although I would definitely call Moore a subversive, I challenge anyone to find an ounce of hatred towards America in this piece. No, Michael Moore loves America, but his America is made up of those who toil and have little or nothing. His America is being looted by people that can only be described as white-collar sociopaths who would be selling heroin or whoring out young girls had they not been brought up in wealthy families.

You also get a generous serving of Michael's trademark humor to make it all go down easier. It has been said that the best way to take the powerful down a peg or two is by poking fun at them, and Moore doesn't just poke at them, he runs them through with swords of bitingly comedic steel.

If I had one gripe about ""Capitalism"" it would be that there was so much more ground that could have been covered. That's why I feel that a sequel is in order as well as a prequel since Moore rather glosses over earlier American history. But I suppose that's what he have Howard Zinn for.

Yes, this is a paramount polemic against capitalism and dare I say FOR socialism. Even Bernie Sanders gets some facetime.

As someone who has been identifying as a socialist for years, I can say that it only reinforced my belief that the free market is unsustainable, as if my personal experience as an American worker hasn't been enough to do so. Demons lurk in the details though, and Moore not only shines a light of veracity on them, he also splashes them with holy water, as any left-leaning Catholic such as Moore would.

Christ wasn't a capitalist sympathizer, something Moore also shows us, and neither is Moore himself. So why should you be? It's not in your best interests to be one. Think of this as an intervention by way of motion picture for your friends and family who are thoroughly in love with an abusive spouse that is all take and no give.

Talk about a great candidate for an ABC Sunday Night Movie. If I could hold screenings for ""Capitalism"" I would. It needs to be seen by far more people than any action/adventure blockbuster.

Thanks for makin' the devils hiss, Mike. And for making socialism taste so good.",1254614400,253,4350,4.645833333333333
3968108,5,B002QW7ALW,"Capitalism: A Love Story is one of Michael Moore's best films to date; it seems that he gets better and more polished over time and that's great. Moore narrates at times to make his point; and he sometimes uses dramatic music that tells you how to feel just as he's making a point; but nevertheless it all works very well as a whole. Moore's film takes on the ugly subject not of capitalism itself but rather the type of extreme, greed-isn't-just-good-in-fact-it's-better-than-ever capitalism that is so common in very wealthy circles including top levels of major corporation management who get ""bailouts"" for making financial mistakes so gross that if we made the same mistakes people would consider us at best to be imprudent--and more likely to be just plain fools who would never deserve a government bailout.

There's so much in this comprehensive film that I'm not quite sure what to tell you and what to leave out so I don't spoil it for you. However, many people have probably seen the trailer for the film which was posted on certain websites, so it's probably not ruining too much to tell you of how Michael Moore takes AIG to task with his mega-microphone; he tries to make a ""citizen's arrest"" of AIG top management outside their building; and his encircling the building with crime scene tape to close it off is both amusing and something many people won't exactly mind seeing. Sadly, we also see many people forced out of their homes with their lives ruined or thrown into chaos all while fat cat management, greedier than ever, makes certain that it keeps a tight control on the most amount of money so that the poor cannot ever even hope to break out of the cycle of poverty into which most of them are born.

Moore's film also tackles other financial issues that expose the remarkable greed of certain large corporations. Companies taking out insurance polices so that they can collect on any sickly employees who die; outsourcing so many jobs that it's going to be difficult or even impossible to ever replace them all; and offshore tax schemes are just some of the few ""strategies"" large, large companies continue to use to make every last red cent that they can possibly make. And, of course, there were the banks that gave out mortgages like candy to people--my father, who has practiced real estate law for 69 years, started scaling back his real estate practice back in 2007 when he noticed that too many people were getting easy money mortgages from banks very far away from where they lived and bought property. To be fair, not enough people read the fine print on those mortgages; but I highly doubt that many of the banks were encouraging them to do so anyway.

And watch how Michael Moore portrays the relationship between big business and Congress. It isn't pretty. Ouch!

Overall, Michael Moore has given us another great film that cleverly examines the financial issues of the day and the debacle caused by corporate greed and wild, brazen extremes of capitalism. Sure, the film is biased toward Moore's own point of view, but it is rather good and I recommend you see it if only to understand where the other side is coming from.

Good job, Michael Moore!",1254614400,9,3188,4.736936936936937
3968109,4,B002QW7ALW,"After several books and movies, the verdict is finally in on Michael Moore: He stirs up the pot, pitches a ""one man hissy fit,"" jumping up and down for media attention like the signifying monkey, and then laughs all the way to the bank as he moves on to the next moneymaking project.

With ""Roger Rabbit,"" that warned about the impending Detroit meltdown, which occurred on schedule as he had predicted: no one in the U.S. moved a muscle and we all watched Detroit sink to the bottom of lake Michigan. In ""Bowling with Columbine,"" where with great skill (if lacking subtlety and finesse), he exposed the machination of the gun merchants and their protectors the heavy-handed gun lobbyists. One thought there would be a great national outcry and a final serious move against the gun lobbyists and the weak kneed Congress that continues to cower under their threats, yet not a peek out of the still comatose American public. Then, just as our senior citizens were chartering caravans of buses across the border into Canada to purchase the same drugs being charged ten times as much to them in the U.S., came ""Sicko:"" a devastating critique of the ""sickness for profit"" system (that we call our national healthcare system), but again, not a solitary growl from the sleeping giant known as the American public?

Now we have ""Capitalism: A Love Story,"" perhaps the renegade filmmaker's best yet. It is a documentary about how both our present President and Congress are ""wholly owned subsidiaries"" of Goldman and Sachs, and about how the Congress and the last President hijacked the economy under a false scare that they themselves had conjured up (with ""credit default swaps"" and other nonsensical financial derivatives). This carefully engineered economic meltdown was only different in scope from the ones they had engineered about a decade before: first in the Keating-McCain scandal and then in the Burt Lance-Jimmy Carter BCCI scandal.

It was also about now they and their lobbyist's friends continue to screw the nation in both the front (with the Obama bailout) and in the rear (with offshore tax dodges, insurance policies on employees, tax cuts obscene salaries and golden parachutes for themselves but low wages for everyone else, outsourcing, etc.) but all in the name of all our most cherished patriotic symbols. Never has there been a more thorough and devastating critique of the way the American middle class, the American farmer, and the American homeowner, have been screwed by the greedy money-hungry ""drive-by"" criminals running the Congress and Wall Street. Yet, I am going to go out on a limb and predict that nothing will happen as a result of this fine film, either.

Why is it the case that when Michael Moore tells the unvarnished truth about what is happening right before our own eyes, no one seems to care? It can't just be that they don't like Moore's brand of politics, because the nation is divided right down the middle between liberals and conservatives (excuse me, between ""progressives"" and conservatives), so that can't be the underlying reason. It also can't be that Michael is just another capitalist himself with a capital ""C."" The movie (and Moore) avowedly are not against capitalism, just against the kind of ""vampire capitalism"" and unregulated ""casino capitalism"" being perpetrated against the American people today by the Wall Street crowd.

I believe the reason goes much deeper and suggests that we are now ""in a fix"" we may never be able to extricate ourselves from.

The grid of parallel fault lines making up the sectors that divide the country have now been Balkanized to the max. There are no more ways remaining by which we further can be divided as a people. As a result, the U.S. has become virtually ungovernable. And this is exactly what the greedy criminal Plutocrats (with their Congressional and Presidential lap dogs) have been angling towards, since FDR's New Deal. They have achieved their goal. There is no longer a ""common good,"" only ""special interests."" And whose interests are the most special of all? Guess? All the real democrats (little ""D"") hate each other's guts and would rather see the country fall they yield one narrow ideological point to another side. All the Balkanized sectors are at right angles to each other. There is no overlap. It's a multidimensional zero-sum game in every direction.

That basically is where our democracy is today, and that's very sad. In the mean time, we elected Obama as the change candidate (that is to say, we elected him only to get rid of the village idiot) and he has distinguished himself by showing us how to ""duck and dodge"" all of the issues that divide us. What else can the poor guy do, become a real leader, god forbid? Did we forget, that that is not what he promised, he didn't promise leadership, just change. Well, how does that saying go: If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, smells like a duck, and ducks like a duck, it is, as Reverend Wright said: Just another Chicago politician. But as Hillary reminded us, he can give a good speech? I am beginning to dislike Obama as much as I disliked Bush, and I am a black man.

Oh, we already know what will happen should ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" begin to really threaten to gain traction. The Plutocrats will circle the wagons and roll out their first line of defense, the racist rightwing media pundits like Limbaugh, Beck and Dobbs. Should the concerned and aware American public then began to wake up and see through this emotional smoke screen (which they rarely do) there still will be graft to spread around like cow manure to our ""morally challenged"" Congressmen, most of whom have yet to see a bag of money or a campaign contribution they could refuse. As a last resort, they will saturate the executive office with a revolving door list of ""who's Who"" in the world of how to screw the American people. And failing that, they can always find somewhere else to start another false war of necessity.

Unless we get up off our duffs, and Obama starts showing some real leadership, we are definitely looking at a one-term Obama Presidency, and then four years of another conservative village idiot, maybe even Sarah Palin. Jesus, please deliver me from this mess? Four stars",1254614400,16,6256,4.833800186741363
3968110,4,B002QW7ALW,"Once again, Michael Moore tackles a tough subject and makes it understandable for the masses. This time, he's addressed the economic crisis in America and the battle between Wall Street and Main Street. While some may disagree with his flamboyant presentation, Moore takes dry subjects and adds interest and humanity. Is the film slanted, yes; however, in the places where Moore states factual numbers, those statements are verifiable. For example, the top 1% of the wealthiest have more assets than the other 99%.

Unfortunately, that top one percent wants to keep it that way and they have so far had the means to do so.  The key topic of this film is unrestrained capitalism resulting in unrestrained greed. As Machiavelli stated, ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely.""

Some examples of capitalistic misuse of power:

Privatization for profit:  The concept of private versus public goods is detailed very well in the case of a juvenile detention center which was privatized in Wilkes Barre, PA. Taxpayers ended up spending $58M for the detention center.  Due to collusion between juvenile judges and the private owners of the center, youths had less than 5 minutes before the bench prior to sentencing for months in detention. Key to this is that neither a judge nor probation worker determined when the kids were to be released--that was left up to an employee of the center who answered to no one but their private sector boss.

""Dead Peasant"" insurance:  In these instances, major employers take out life insurance policies on their employees to the extent that their 'human resources' are worth more to them dead than alive.

In addition to cases like these, Moore discusses the bailouts, unique work situations and how the people of Main Street are taking back their own power.

Moore states his case for the people Main Street in a cogent, compassionate, and entertaining fashion.  The film is well worth seeing.

3968111,5,B002QW7ALW,"Thank goodness there's a Michael Moore out there who will use the Mass Media for the correct and noble purpose of telling the American citizenry the awful truth.  How far we've fallen...

Capitalism: A Love Story is historically accurate and funny.  While the movie does tug on your emotions to watch families being evicted out of their houses, it's not a cheap shot.  Your seeing real life footage of what the consequences of unregulated capitalism (aka: greed on a mass scale) has done to the United States of America and to most of it's people.  You also get to see just how devious and manipulative the people WE elect to office have become.  Ronald Reagan, the Clintons, W., Senator Chris Dodd and many others should never have been allowed to hold public office in the first place... and for those still alive, they should be stripped of their titles and booted out onto the street at the nearest bus stop. They can pay for their own ticket!

While watching this movie I was angry, awed, surprised and inspired.  I was also concerned .... the way this country is going is how Germany after WWI started the Nazi movement.  We need a viable third party in this country badly.  I just hope that third entity doesn't turn into the Third Reich.

This is a really good documentary.  It is non-partisan -- -- no one is immune.  Michael Moore has done this country loads of good by standing up and shouting from the roof tops about how this country's greedy elite have used the everyday American as their personal ATM.  Enough is Enough.",1254528000,7,1535,4.6162361623616235
3968112,4,B002QW7ALW,"Just as thought-provoking, clever, and humorous as his previous documentaries, Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story turns its disapproving eye to the title economic system and its disastrous effects on people across America. As the film progresses and we're shown numerous examples of families thrown out of their houses, factory workers laid off without warning, and taxpayers shelling out billions to bail out banks, it becomes apparent that capitalism itself isn't to blame, but rather the avaricious few who abuse the policies and corrupt those in power. As it exposes the guilty further lining their pockets, it also offers plenty of hope, emphasizing the minor and major rebellions that prove that change is just around the corner. And for many frightened CEO's, so is Michael Moore, with his intimidating microphone and a demand for answers.

No stranger to tackling the big issues, documentarian Michael Moore takes on capitalism and the reasons behind America's recent economic ""meltdown"". Beginning in Rome and bringing us up to date with the recession, the purported evils of capitalism are compared to everything from vultures to Vegas casinos, and its negative impact blamed for death profiteering, predatorial bank lending, and the eventual downfall of democracy. But with the depressing realizations of a good system gone wrong, Moore invokes his trademark brand of clever humor, creative editing, and a little grandstanding pizzazz.

Michael Moore has reached a point of notoriousness that unfortunately prevents his opposition from ever seeing his material. Sadly, only those who admire his political viewpoints are likely to see Capitalism: A Love Story, and those who despise his ostentatious methods will avoid it outright. While his style of documenting facts is slanted at best, the way he edits his films is fascinating and highly entertaining. Instilled with plenty of humor, the largely depressing topics become resoundingly more absorbable, and are unquestionably important. Grand, thundering music highlights his focal points, frequently increasing the hilarity or aiding in the finger-pointing. At times it's thrilling, tear-jerking, comedic, and thought-provoking, but always educational.

Capitalism is essentially the pursuit of the American Dream and it didn't set out to be evil. It was a good intention that only spiraled downward when it started to negatively control democracy. The rich want to stay rich, so the poor have no choice but to stay poor. Too bad the rich control the government and getting a piece of the wealth pie requires deciphering the foreign language of Wall Street. Moore presents many stances on democracy, socialism, taking advantage of others' misfortunes, profit motives, free enterprise, employers profiting on the deaths of their workers, propaganda, the Senate Housing Committee's failure to police mortgage scams and other white collar crimes, and bail outs, but ultimately the real villain is self-indulgence, consumption and greed. And for that there is no cure.

3968113,1,B002QW7ALW,"Ok, so here's the lowdown, before jumping to dry conclusion:

1) In this picture, Michael Moore is REALLY MAKING A FOOL OUT OF HIMSELF!

Putting yellow crime scene tape around NYSE and standing in front of AIG building with the money bag is plain stupid, no matter how you slice it. Yes, he is populist, not academic, however, even a media person must make constructive argument to generate interest from a normal thinking human being.

Moreover, by acting this way he is actually alienating his would be supporters. NY Times and New Yorker magazine - not exactly bastions of conservative power - are not generous in their reviews of the film.

2) For the love of God, when will we ever learn to take things seriously?
This means NOT fast tracking through mortgage applications, before signing your name for a hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt.
Or actually going to the library or Google to learn SPECIFIC things about financial instruments, interest rates, economic bubbles and so on, as opposed to getting your knowledge from dumbed down CNN reports.

There is a warning at the beginning.. Next scenes from bank robberies. Then a movie about ancient Rome. Is there a lesson for today here? Why did Rome decline? [Why do nations and corporations decline today? Bad decisions by management.] Police bang on the door to a house, three is a video-recording. One house is boarded up after the people are evicted. Are we divided into those who have it all and those who have nothing? One man buys foreclosed condominiums and resells them at a profit. [Who buys them?] Its part of the housing crash, where houses were sold to people who couldn't afford them. [The documentary Inside Job reveals how this swindle caused the current economic depression.] Free enterprise suggests an equal economy where consumers are free to chose, and there are no barriers to producers. Moore recalls the good old days before the 1970's when the US was the dominant power.

Did the election of Reagan cause the decline of America? Or was this election the result of the rise of corporate power? Household debt increased, wages were flat while productivity escalated. A GM spokesman explains they had to reduce their workers to stay out of bankruptcy; but they went bankrupt anyway. [What about declining sales?] The loss of jobs affected the local economy. In Germany workers have representatives on the Board of Directors and can influence policy. One GM plant was razed, an empty lot remains. In 2008 a company fired all its union workers just before Christmas. This was repeated all over the country. Does the free market system guarantee social justice and human dignity? PA Child Care is a privately owned prison for teenagers in Wilkes-Barre. Is this an example of corruption, payoffs for convictions?

Next a report on the oppression of airline pilots, whose pay was cut and their pensions terminated. [A recession affects all people.] Do pilots need food stamps to survive? Do pilots have high student debt and need a second job? Do cuts in the budget affect airline safety? Can a corporation take out an insurance policy on an employee? Does this create a vested interest in their deaths? [Do they get this money from lower pay to their employees?] Dead Peasants? Is capitalism a sin for religions? Moore interviews a bishop, who quotes the bible. Is Wall Street a holy place? Is America a place where the top 1% own more than the bottom 95%? Yes. Moore visits a factory where employees make three times the pay of an entry-level airline pilot. Moores asks about derivatives and credit-default swaps on Wall Street.

Professor Warren talks about the swindle of home owners by refinancing. They had to deregulate the laws to do this. But when interest rates went up people lost their homes. This is called predatory loans, loans to people who couldn't pay them back. [Bankruptcy protection?] An epidemic of mortgage fraud was noted in 2004. The collapse occurred in September 2008. Corporations went bankrupt, the stock market crashed. But a lot of people got very rich! The Treasury Department is a arm of Wall Street. There were threats of disaster unless Congress voted for the bailouts of Wall Street. They did! A financial coup detat? Where did the $700 billion go? Will Americans turn against the rich? Who does the government work for? An evicted family tried to take their home back. Squatters in their own homes? Moore tells how FDR and the Governor of Michigan supported the sit-down strike in Flint. Do people need an economic Bill of Rights? Why does society work to enrich the few at the expense of the many? How can it be changed?

This is a very interesting and informative documentary even if you don't believe in all of Moores comments. Should peoples tax money bail out Wall Street swindlers? Does this make the people the real owners of these firms?",1511222400,,3837,4.851908396946565

Moore is a really good propagandist. He tells a lot of truth which he bends to his purpose by mislabeling things. For example, he uses examples of government officials on the take as ""capitalism."" He interviews Catholic clergy who use Jesus quotes against the rich in condemnation of capitalism -- an economic system that wouldn't exist for a millennium plus centuries. The 2008 TARP bail-out is used as a condemnation of the free-market.

No Ron Paul talking about the Fed.

Totalitarian control of the economy. In other words, giving even more centralized corrupt power to the same people he's condemning,

Then he tops it off with a phony quote from Benjamin Franklin about everything you earn beyond your immediate needs belongs to the state.

PEOPLE came from all over and brought them food. Pizza places delivered gratis. They WON!  Also Learned something new - that FDR wrote a Second Bill of Rights for the American People with a strong slant for workers, as a result of the many things they'd experienced. Sadly, he died before they could be implemented, but it's still ready and waiting to be enacted into Law........and what a piece of work that would be for the average American.

3968256,3,B002QW7ALW,"Good, but flawed.  He takes on most of what has gone wrong in this country, but IOUSA (the book) does a
better job of exposing WalMart, and how that ten cent t-shirt cost you a billion dollars (because WalMart
employees have to go on assistance: food stamps, etc., which YOU pay for). The biggest flaw in this film is
his sweet but nave idolization of the church. The church has been the BIGGEST beneficiary of capitalism
historically, and what is now FEUDALISM, in this country. It's called the ""faith based initiative"" and it's TITHING,
and YOU pay for it. Churches get BILLIONS in grants, and don't even have to write tax forms to tell you how they
spent it, unlike legitimate charities. They harass the people they help, and harass women at abortion clinics,
who get abortions because they are poor - and they are poor, thanks to the money-laundering of churches.
Poor countries were crushed by the rich and powerful Catholic church - think of Spain until the 1970s and Italy
until pretty recent times, too. France as well. Only socialism saved these countries from being third world - the
church didn't.  Protestant countries fared a little better, because the churches were less wealthy and
powerful (didn't England rule the world because they crushed the church?). The US is a third world
country today not just because of Wall Street and the rich, and bribed politicians, but because of the
money and power in the church. You can thank Bush for that. And Moore doesn't utter a peep against the
church, which is not only disappointing, but an inaccurate portrayal of how the church has benefited from
the system - at your expense.",1456012800,,1637,4.76056338028169

3968371,5,B002QW7ALW,"Capitalism: A Love Story is a documentary that features Michael Moore,who wrote and directed the film. It centers on the late- 2000s financial crisis and the recovery stimulus, while putting forward an indictment of the current economic order in the United States and capitalism in general.

Topics covered include Wall Street's ""casino mentality"", for-profit prisons, Goldman Sachs' influence in Washington, D.C., the poverty-level wages of many workers, the large wave of home foreclosures, corporate-owned life insurance, and the consequences of ""runaway greed"".

With thousands of U.S. jobs lost every day and taxpayer money constantly being pumped into failing financial institutions, the question must be asked: how long can this go on before the entire system collapses? Is there really any hope for Americans who are losing their homes to foreclosure and seeing their savings get wiped out at an unprecedented rate? In order to seek out an answer to these questions, Moore takes a trip to our nation's capitol, engaging average Americans in conversations about the prospect of repairing America's failing, debt-ridden economy along the way.

Moore is always visually playful and subversive, and even when dealing with such serious and depressing topics entertaining; but he's also game enough to examine America's mythology of prosperity. Also,he is brave enough to discuss about the fall of The American Dream as he acts as our tour guide into what's wrong with the U.S.",1414886400,,1479,5.393939393939394

3968429,5,B002QW7ALW,"As a filmmaker, Michael Moore is hit and miss. When he's on, as in his award-winning 1989 breakthrough film ""Roger and Me,"" his righteous outrage produces brilliant social commentary. When he's off, as in ""Fahrenheit 911,"" he comes across with self-righteous anger that fails to find a coherent message. But he's always interesting and fun to watch when he doesn't diverge from the path of reason into ideological crankery. The 2009 film ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is one of his more restrained and hence better efforts. Tapping into popular outrage over the 2009 U.S. economic crash, Moore deftly elucidates and dispenses with the economic self-delusions that got us into the problem int he first place. In fact, this film may well be Moore's best, and could even be seen as a sequel to ""Roger and Me"" inasmuch as it revisits a lot of the same places (Flint, Michigan) and themes of his first major film, explicitly acknowledging it as its forefather. But Moore has gone further here, revealing more of himself than ever before, particularly his Catholic upbringing and conscience as instigators of his passion to fix our broken economic system. He assembles an impressive parade of priests and religious figures here to back up his social justice message, but he also shows his strengths as a grassroots filmmaker by telling the stories of hardworking American families who have lost homes to foreclosure due to the selfish overreaching of corporate power brokers that infects our current system from the top-down. His factual analysis of how the interest rate system preys on the simple and innocent through mathematical shell games is particularly inspired. This film is not to be missed if you want to understand more of the roots of our current U.S. economic woes -- and how a Catholic conscience inspires one to redress injustices.",1382140800,,1838,5.029508196721311

3968431,1,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore's purpose was to advocate revolution which would overthrow capitalism and replace it with socialism. The most frustrating aspect of the DVD was that he never defined either capitalism or socialism. Capitalism was accused of taking advantage of misfortune. Capitalists were called vultures and capitalism was labeled a radical evil. It was implied that socialism was the solution to the problem.

But rather than presenting a logical explanation of why capitalism was inherently evil and why socialism was inherently good, Moore focused on personal cases of individuals who were evicted from their homes. While he presented several scenarios which were designed to create sympathy for the victim, we never really were told what had transpired. I do not doubt that in at least some instances the banks or companies were wrong, but it does not logically follow that because of particular cases of abuse that the entire capitalistic system is the problem. Moore employed a technique called guilt by association. There was not necessary a logical connection between the specific cases he was presenting and the case he was attempting to make against capitalism.

It is interesting that the movie opened with an attempt to compare Rome to the U. S. However, the Roman empire was a dictatorship. As long as I have lived I have heard preachers talk about why Rome fell and use that as a warning that America, too, could fall. They gave such reasons as free bread and circuses, high taxation and immorality, but never before had I heard that it fell because it was capitalistic. In fact, it was not.

All of the ancient world empires were dictatorships in which the king, pharaoh, or caesar claimed to be god. They were wealthy at the expense of their subjects and there was not a middle class. At a later point in history kings appealed to divine authority for their legitimacy. This argument was called the divine right of kings, meaning that it is God's will for you to obey me. Finally, we had an atheistic world empire called communism in which the state was god.

However, we also see in history the magna carta and later the social contract. This concept is based on the biblical idea of covenants in which the subjects must agree to the terms under which they are governed. Thus the highest authority in the U. S. is the constitution. The point of a constitution is limited government. The government only has the right to exercise authority in areas where that is conceded by the people.

Moore's reference to our constitution was very disappointing. He asks a guard where in the constitution capitalism was prescribed and not getting a satisfactory answer implied that it is not in the constitution. He picks up three phrases, ""we the people,"" ""welfare,"" and ""union"" to imply that socialism is prescribed. This argument would not convince anyone who is beyond grade school. ""We the people"" actually refers to the consent of the governed to grant the government certain limited power. ""To promote the general welfare"" does not prescribe a welfare state, but actually means that individual citizens collectively surrender certain freedom for the common good. ""A more perfect union"" does not refer to labor unions, but to a collective agreement.

Here I have to digress to say that the use of the term ""more perfect"" is highly irregular. If something is perfect, how can it become more perfect? Actually we are still trying to perfect our union. That means our government is not perfect and we are still working at it. And so it is legitimate to have these kinds of civil discourses.

But before we continue we have to define some terms. So what is capitalism? Capitalism is a free market economy in which the government does not interfere with buying and selling. The old term was laissez faire, a French term which means literally ""let it be."" In practice it means that transactions between private parties are free from state intervention, including restrictive regulations, taxes, tariffs and enforced monopolies. It is the belief that the market forces of supply and demand will work things out.

In 2003 while in Nigeria there was unrest in the streets because petro was too high. A general strike was planned. And so the government stepped in an determined the price of petro. Did that solve the problem? No, although petro was reasonably priced you could not find a station which was open. The owners determined to close their stations rather than sell at a loss. And so the government backed down and the stations reopened.

The alternative is for a special interest group to appeal to the government for protection or privilege. When the government begins to interfere with market forces they tend to make things worse. If it sides with the workers against the owners, the owners will shut down because the playing field is not level. If it sides with business and banks against the workers, you have corporate greed.

And here is where I want to give Moore his due. The best part of the movie was his documentation of what happened with the recent bailout. Moore blamed both sides - a Republican president and a Democratic congress. However, his conclusion was wrong. This was not free-market capitalism at work - it was in fact socialism. Socialism is when the government takes charge of certain sectors of the economy.

Here I need to comment on a couple of coops that Moore featured. I like the coop model of ownership and management, but I would not regard it as socialism because it is not government control or manipulation of market forces. However, I find it interesting that Moore advocates the coop saying that it has proven itself to be lucrative. But that is an appeal to capitalism! In a sense when I buy stock in a company that also allows me a share in the profits. Profit sharing is not a unique concept. Even Walmart offers that to their employees.

It seems to me that when you come to the economy you either have to leave it alone or control it all. Socialism is kind of a half-way house to communism. Communism is where the government controls all aspects of life. There is no middle class in communism. Everyone shares the wealth - but there is no wealth unless you are a bureaucrat. In other words, everyone is equal but some of us are more equal than others.

Throughout history no attempt to implement communism has succeeded. You know enough about hippy communes to verify that. There is no incentive to work when you do not keep the rewards of you labor. Yes, I believe in helping the helpless but I believe that should be voluntary and not a compulsory redistribution of wealth under the authority of a government bureaucratic system. No one has my best interests at heart better than I do. All I ask from my government is to be left alone. My faith is in a big God, not big government.

And so capitalism provides freedom but there is also risk. Socialism provides security, but at the expense of freedom. I was interested that Moore was enamored with Roosevelt's second bill of rights. According to Roosevelt I have the right to a good paying job, a house, an education, and health care. But who will administer these ""rights""? Government interference has driven up the price of housing, education, and health care.

What if the government guarantees me a good paying job making widgets, but there is no longer any demand for widgets? The socialistic model says the government should subsidize our widget plant. But when you subsidize something for which there is no market you only compound the problem. Look at the recent example with the Volt car, a glorified golf cart. The Obama administration used our tax dollars to bail out GM and they created a car which no one wants. Under a capitalistic system it is no one's business what I drive. Under a socialistic government, they make Volts and under communism no one has a car unless they are a government leader.

In the olden days, when people lost their job they often found a different line of work. I would not even think of asking the government to guarantee my job. I believe in self-reliance and a work ethic. That coupled with a free market means that I just need to discover what there is a market for. No need to subsidize the making of buggy whips when you can get a job at the automobile factory.

I would assert that the U. S. has not operated on a truly free market economy since the days of Roosevelt. Roosevelt was influence by the economic theory of John Maynard Keynes. Keynes was a socialist who said you can stimulate the economy if the government will spend money fast enough. From the days of Roosevelt forward both parties have operated under Keynesian economics. The conservatives just did not spend it as fast. In 1971, Nixon - a Republican, said ""we are all Keynesians now."" In early American history some presidential campaigns were based on a ""hard currency,"" meaning that debt or credit was illegal. This would prohibit fractional reserve banking in which a bank only retains a small percentage of its assets.

The immorality of Keynesian economics is that it is based on easy credit. The recent banking scandals prove the bankruptcy of Keynesian economics in selling bad debt and getting to government to guarantee it. While Moore touted the superiority of the European socialism, what we are seeing right now, especially in Greece, is the collapse of their economy. The Obama administration recently used our tax money to bail out the European banks. When you have more takers than givers, any system will collapse. We may not be far behind.

And so I agree that we need a revolution. But I would advocate overthowing our existing socialism and returning to capitalism. I further would charge Moore with hypocrisy. He himself is a capitalist who is worth $50 million. But socialists always want to use my money to fix the problem. If he is so committed to socialism, he could start by distributing some of his wealth.

According to Moore, Jimmy Carter tried to warn us. But Carter was an inept president who got us into a recession. According to Moore, Ronald Reagan was the problem. I believe firmly that Reagan was the greatest president of my lifetime and that Roosevelt was the one who got us into the problem.

According to Moore, Obama was elected to effect change and his election is the beginning of a revolution. But Moore also said that Timothy Geithner had failed at everything he had attempted. But Obama appointed him as Secretary of the Treasury! I think Obama has been a disappointment even to his supporters. Now as he seeks re-election he is making high-dollar speeches to the wealthy 1% while the occupy wall-street movement is trying to implement Moore's vision for a revolution.

I was very disappointed when Bush bailed out the banks. Bush ran as a conservative, but remember we have not have a truly free market president for a hundred years. I think he should have let the banks deal with their own problem. If they are true capitalists, let them risk their own money without using taxpayers money as their safety net.

And I am not opposed to evicted homeowners moving back into their homes as squatters. I think that high interest is immoral and in the case that Moore documented, if they had paid their mortgage for 22 years they had probably paid the bank twice what the house was worth already.

I think Moore is misguided to encourage class warfare. I think everyone pays too much in taxes. I am not envious of anyone's wealth. I want everyone to prosper. I am not in favor of rationing the pieces of the pie, I am in favor of having a bigger pie. I think Moore is naive in his understand of socialism. Yet he ended the movie with L' Internationale, the anthem of international socialism.

Then he ended with Merle Haggard singing a song that implied that Jesus was killed for attacking capitalism or at least the establishment. Jesus died on the cross to atone for our sins, but I would agree that he did offend the establishment. Throughout the movie Moore appealed to Jesus in a very selective way. Essentially Moore employed liberation theology. When communism found it hard to make inroads into South America, because it was strongly Roman Catholic and they were atheistic, they developed liberation theology which basically said that Jesus was a revolutionary like all of the other Marxists. Of course this is just propaganda.

I think Moore's whole movie is basically a propaganda piece designed to create an uninformed reaction to capitalism and a revolution that will lead to something no one has really thought through. And how can we have a civil discourse if their leader is a sheepdog named Shelby?

Remember that all progress requires change, but not all change is progress. I share the occupy wall street frustration with the bank bailouts, but I just don't see that camping out in the city park will change what needs changing. We are going to have to educate ourselves about how the economy works and then hold our leaders accountable. We need less government interference. We are going to have to get out of debt, take charge of our own future, and not depend upon anyone else to take care of us. The price of cradle to grave security is the loss of freedom and I am unwilling to give it up. If we do they will end up using us to take care of themselves.

A much better approach to economics is John Wesley's sermon ""The Use of Money."" In it he advocates three points:

 Gain all you can - this is the principle of industry or capitalism
 Save all you can - this is the principle of economy or stewardship
 Give all you can - this is the principle of charity or compassionate capitalism",1381795200,14,13669,4.747155499367889

In the documentary film, Moore makes us see that other institutions have a vested interest in keeping the economy the way it is, because they are making money off of the system too, thus keeping ordinary working citizens chained to an unending cycle of endless debt and product consumerism.",1376697600,,623,5.088235294117647

3968464,4,B002QW7ALW,"This is vintage Michael Moore. Perhaps less focused than ""Roger & Me"", ""Farenheit 9/11"", or ""Sicko"", Moore, nonetheless, makes his point in this semi-documentary, a genre of which he is a master. Released in 2009, it opens with a disclaimer from an unsmiling narrator warning anyone with a heart condition or is easily upset, or is in the company of impressionable young children, to leave the theater immediately for one's own health and safety. It next cuts to a clip from an Encyclopaedia Britannica Films documentary entitled ""Life in Ancient Rome"", most likely produced in the mid to late 1940's, and intended as an audio-visual supplement in high schools of that period as a part of the then traditional instructional pedagogy. Anyone familiar with Edward Gibbon's six volume classic of the late eighteenth century entitled ""The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" with all of its attendant irony will enjoy the next several minutes of film as its intercuts between the rise and fall of Rome, and clips of the principals of the George W. Bush administration as they preside over the end of ""American Exceptionalism"". GM and G.W. have been previous targets of Mr. Moore, so he is on familiar ground when he returns to his native Flint, Michigan to show b&w film clips of the GM plant there in its glory days during the 1930's and '40's, and scenes of a crumbling community today after the departure of GM. During the opening titles of the film we see actural footage of a security camera in a bank as it records an armed robbery in progress while ""Louie, Louie"" plays in the background. Much of the remaining footage deals with the big banks, Wall Street and capitalism in general and what has resulted in recent years in, or to this country from an unbridled laissez faire (literally: ""let people do as they choose"") form of capitalism. Moore has used his form of story telling to make the same point as writers like Andrew J. Bacevich made in his book of 2008 entitled ""The Limits of Power"". The message: ""Beware of what you ask for!"" What you get is likely not going to be what you asked for. He reminds us, through interviews with three Catholic clerics, that Jesus did not advocate capitalism, though he clererly overdubs an old movie about Jesus where the latter appears, or sounds, like he is ardently advocating this economic nodel. There is the implied suggestion that the gospel message of the New Testament and the ""Gospel of Success"" that is preached in many venues today are neither synonymous nor compatible. Moore, it should be noted, is a practicing Catholic. He also makes a trip to the National Archives in a vain search for mention of the word ""capitalism"" in the U.S. Constitution. The film ends with with quotations from some of our founding fathers, e.g. ""I sincerely believe that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies"" ... Thomas Jefferson, 1816; or ""Property monopolized or in the possession of a few is a curse to mankind"" ... John Adams, 1765. As the quotes scroll by one hears the voice of Merle Haggard singing an old Woody Guthrie classic ""Jesus Christ.""  If you are one who can be provoked into an excerise of the brain called ""independenty thought"", then this is a movie for you, but for the easily excitable, be sure and take your blood pressure medication before inserting the disk into your DVD player.",1371340800,,3383,4.782905982905983

  He also shows how creepy corporations can be. For instance they take out life insurance on employees -- not their executives -- regular hourly workers.  When the employee dies and the families are struggling just to pay funeral expenses the corporations cash in.  After this story Wal-Mart discontinued this policy.

3968523,1,B002QW7ALW,"As someone who has mildly enjoyed several of Mr. Moore's films in the last several years, particularly Fahrenheit 911, I was heartily disappointed by his failure to deliver when it came to ""Capitalism: A Love Story."" Given that there was so much potential for a serious, methodical, coherent documentary on all of the flaws of laissez-faire American capitalism as it has been practiced over the last thirty years, I was stunned that his overall product could be so childish and banal.

Mr. Moore opens and closes the film with scenes of a family in rural America being evicted from their home. According to the narration the home has been in the family for several generations. Why these people are being evicted, he does not say. We do not know if it failure to pay a mortgage (probably not, if it is a family property); failure to pay property taxes; or other indebtedness on the part of the homeowners. From the looks of them, they do not appear to be the most financially responsible people in the world. Mr. Moore would have us believe that whatever the reason these people are losing their home, it should somehow be perceived as a black mark against capitalism itself. He neglects to mention that millions of Americans buy homes and live in them for years or even decades while being financially responsible and no one ever shows up to repossess the property in question.

Mr. Moore goes on to address the frenzied building boom in Florida during the housing bubble, and the subsequent emergence of the 'vulture condo' industry where enterprising (and somewhat unscrupulous) investors purchase foreclosed properties at deep discounts to their original price, usually at the expense of the owner being forced into the sale. While the housing bubble of 2000-2007 will no doubt be remembered as one of the worst excesses in US financial history, the presence of thousands of blighted homes on the coast of Florida can hardly be considered the worst feature of modern capitalism. As the very presence of so called 'vulture capitalists' would imply, the current expectation is that eventually the housing market will recover and new buyers will scoop up these properties. Otherwise they would be owned by the bank at this point and not new, private investors. We might sympathize with the people who originally lost their homes (or investments, as they might be) but it is not like they would be the first people to go down in history as overzealous speculators who lost their shirts at the height of a financial bubble.

Mr. Moore also chooses to attack the private prison industry, which admittedly is one of the more horrifying features of America's prison-industrial complex and the privatization of state services in general, but not on general principle, but because a corrupt judge was receiving kickbacks from a private corrections company to whose facility he was sentencing juvenile delinquents. One corrupt judge invalidates the legitimacy of American capitalism? Give me a break. Then he goes on to denigrate the airline industry for paying low salaries to entry level pilots. As a pilot myself, I know just how little airline pilots at most airlines are paid. And yet the airlines continue to be inundated with applications whenever a hiring window opens up! Did Mr. Moore ever hear about supply and demand? Does he not know that when a plethora of people, for whatever reason, supply their labor to a given industry far in excess of what is demanded, that the price of their labor will fall? Are we supposed to excoriate the capitalist system over this immutable fact?

Mr. Moore's treatment of Wall Street is equally pedestrian and sophomoric. For anyone who actually wants to see a good documentary about the corruption inherent on Wall Street, and in particular the links between financiers and our lawmakers in Washington, check out ""Inside Job"" by Charles Ferguson. Whereas Mr. Moore had the opportunity to examine the deep wrongdoing of Wall Street in this film, he instead bores us to tears with theatrics showing him trying to force his way into the Goldman Sachs headquarters. When trying to expose the (unnecessary) complexity of the derivatives trade, he tries to prove his point by interviewing a succession of financial 'experts' who cannot explain in plain English what a derivative is. Anyone who wants to know what a derivative contract is can look it up on Wikipedia; if Mr. Moore is trying to make a point by interviewing a number of twerps who lack the acumen to successfully explain it themselves, he is making a hollow point.

About the only redeeming feature of this film is his commentary that a) during the last thirty years our best young minds have in fact gravitated towards Wall Street and not towards careers in science, engineering, medicine, education, the arts, or public service - although this point has already been made ad nauseam by plenty of other opinion makers; and b) bailout money made available to the major banks was hoarded instead of being put back into the economy, a point he makes by highlighting the plight of a Chicago window manufacturer that is shut down for lack of access to bank funds even though it's principal creditor, Bank of America, has just received a major TARP loan.

Altogether a very weak documentary, in fact I will take the gloves off and say that it is a total waste of time and money. Shame on Mr. Moore - this piece could have been so much better but it looks like he is finally succumbing to his own hubris.",1351814400,17,5496,4.8664529914529915
3968534,1,B002QW7ALW,"From the very beginning, people like Michael Moore always attempt to redefine capitalism. Adam Smith already defined it hundreds of years ago. One of the pillars of that definition is the notion that people on both sides of a contract enter into it freely because they both believe they are getting something out of it. People like Michael Moore are all over the map on that one issue. On one hand, they really don't believe you're smart enough to make decisions for yourselves. On the other hand, they don't want business owners to be able to make their own decisions either. When they critique capitalism, they almost always criticize things that contain a heavy dosage of coercion, meaning the thing they are critiquing doesn't meet the most basic definition of capitalism.

Michael Moore does not even really understand the thing he is attempting to criticize at the most basic level and it saddens me that people will view this movie without first understanding that when one side of a transaction is coerced, the transaction ceases to be capitalist in nature. For the sake of brevity, I will end my review there.",1351641600,8,1118,4.853403141361256

3968538,5,B002QW7ALW,"Capitalism: A Love Story is Michael Moore's best.  I kept applauding throughout  the film.  Moore's argument is less with capitalism than with capitalism's most egregious excesses in the U.S., mainly the greed of the banking industry and the gambling on Wall Street.  His ideal is not the end of private ownership, but more cooperatively owned businesses where everyone shares the wealth and makes collective decisions.  With clips from Ronald Reagan's old movies and days in office, Moore colorfully shows how Reagan's policies began our current economic decline.  The funniest moments are when Moore asks several bankers to explain what derivatives are.  All fumble and stumble.  Of course, derivatives themselves aren't funny.  For example, they  might involve bets placed on the expectation that folks will default on their mortgages  Perhaps the most horrifying account in the movie is of a judge who was paid for each  juvenile he sent to privately owned detention centers.  He happily  sent large numbers, many for trivial offenses.  Another horrifying moment is the segment on ""dead peasant"" insurance.  (Yes, that is what it is called.)  This is the insurance which companies (like WalMart) take out on their employees, making them more valuable  to the company dead than alive.  The heroine of the film is Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) who advised her constituents not to move if a bank foreclosed and to demand that the bank produce a copy of their mortgage.  In many cases, the banks can't.  The most encouraging moment is about the workers who protested Bank of America's refusal to pay wages earned.  The workers won.  My favorite image is of Moore using bright yellow police-crime-scene tape to block off the Stock Exchange.  I cheered!  The most inspiring moment is a clip of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, not long before his death,  proposing his Second Bill of Rights for Americans, calling for the right to homes, jobs, education, and health care.  What a tragedy that he did not live to carry out its passage!  But it is there for us to carry out.  And that is the challenge of Moore's wonderful film.",1348617600,,2115,5.014409221902017
3968539,4,B002QW7ALW,"Moore tackles another hard subject, the corruptness of our financial sector and how Wall Street owns our country.  Showing the lives of people who have been ruined by the very powerful to bring home the message, it's not a free-market, its a rigged market.  Definitely worth seeing!",1348012800,,282,4.9787234042553195
3968540,5,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story is quite a documentary! Although I don't agree with every last thing Moore believes, I have to admire his ability to make a documentary that is entertaining, poignant at times and informative (well, informative from his point of view). Moore's general premise, as you might know by now, is that capitalism stinks and he desperately tries to prove that all throughout the movie, stopping at practically nothing to make his point. For example, his interviews with priests are very well positioned in the film to influence his audience; and even if you don't agree with him I think the interviews with the priests are presented nicely. Moore also uses some pretty silly antics along the way; he wants to drive home his point in such a way that the audience won't forget his message anytime soon. Look for him to cordon off a bank building in downtown Manhattan as a crime scene!

There's so much in this film that I scarcely know where to begin. For one, after the financial crash of 2008 Moore interviewed Congressmen and women who had to vote on a huge government bailout of big business with practically no time or advance notice whatsoever to review the bailout terms before voting. We learn that Congress initially voted against the bailout at least partly because it was unpopular with many constituents; and then Moore explores why the Congress was pressured by both political parties to vote again just days later, this time in favor of the bailout.

One aspect of the film that definitely hit home for me was the topic of how greedy big banks routinely tricked people into taking out sub-prime mortgages on their homes without advising them of how the interest rates go dramatically skyrocket after an initial period of time; and the footage we get of the struggle one family in Miami, Florida goes through to keep their home was poignant. The segment about airline pilots being paid so little saddened me; and it was interesting and even slightly amusing to see Moore trying to understand how derivatives work on Wall Street. There's also time devoted to a Chicago factory worker's strike when they were laid off without pay or severance. We also learn how the federal government was changed possibly forever by the influence of big business and Wall Street; this process mostly started during the Reagan administration.

There's so much more; it may seem as if I've given it all away but I assure you that I haven't.

The DVD comes with several bonus features which expand on Moore's views in this film.

Overall, Capitalism: A Love Story was Michael Moore's way to call it as he sees it when the topic is capitalism. This is a film most people are going to either love or hate because Moore's opinions run all through the film and people will either agree with him or disagree with him. Of course, there will be a third group of people like myself who agree with most of what he says but not quite all of it.",1347840000,,2958,4.713733075435203

3968543,4,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore got his ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" all wrong. He had some good ideas, but in terms of his sections on the financial institutions he missed most of the causes and the depth of the miserable acts committed. It was far worse than he, and many others thought. And, at the same time, much of it wasn't done in all consciousness, at least for some.  Many people don't aim to drive their neighbors out of their homes on purpose. Much of it was done by executives given a little too much slack in the usual pressure cooker of the workplace, topped off with the usual personal ambition...and laziness. I can say this based on past experiences working at large financial institutions.

I enjoyed Capitalism: A Love Story, though I thought the film Inside Job was more focused on the Great Financial Crisis and showed more credibility by relying on interviews with recognized figures. Most recently, the film Four Horsemen took a similar, though perhaps lower budget, approach to Inside Job.

A Love Story was first and gets credit here, but in the end it was dramatized and simplistic. It was so simplistic at times it took away from the credibility of the message. Moore spent much time on the disenfranchised middle class factory worker. This was noble or sensationalist, depending on perspective. And the Wal-Mart insurance story regarding the so-called ""dead peasant policies"" was truly sad. Yet some of these stories proved distorted when reading the fine print.

Conceptually, the ""jobs moving overseas"" concept popular with many Americans and politicians is exactly why the middle class factory worker became a dinosaur - although ironically there have been signs of small revivals given the weaker dollar.

Corporations, unions and politicians speeded the problem up by making Americans less and less competitive while Americans became the world's consumer of last resort by policy design. Moore somehow assumes that the rest of the world should be unchanged. True, some of China's wages were lower than a ""true market price."" But not all pricing and labor costs from Japan to Thailand and many parts of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, etc were targeted at the US using unfair labor practices.

Americans were bred to feed on consumerism by design while the rest of the world got boosts in GDP growth, in some perverted overtime version of the post WWII Marshall Plan gone wild. I went to S Korea at first in the early 1980s. I recall meeting an insurance broker who quoted daily death statistics for shipyard workers. Korea was one big factory targeting catch up to Japan. When I went back in the 90s I was surprised to see how few American products were imported. Koreans were famous for having substitutes for everything, including chewing gum. There was no equality of products. Only protectionism. Which US policy makers did nothing about while the US trade deficit just grew out of control in the unspoken name of promoting economic development growth. Living in Taiwan in the mid-80s I saw pretty much the same thing, though on a lesser scale. The problem started with American policy.

Unfortunately, with movies like A Love Story many people can be influenced in the wrong - simplistic - direction. I am not singling out A Love Story. There were some other problem accounts and films. The worst job of all perhaps was Wall Street, Money Never Sleeps (2010; $100m production cost?). A Love Story simplified and over-dramatized what it could find, as opposed to trying to capture what it did not understand (ie, the real scope of the lapses of judgment at banker personal levels, the down and dirty dastardly deeds such as how can one value AIG paper at 100 cents on the dollar...), while Money Never Sleeps simply left out the concept of an investment bank altogether! There wasn't even a character that was close to an investment banker in Money Never Sleeps, and investment bankers were and are at the heart of banks.

At times also that movies like Boiler Room (2000; $26m production cost?) with Vin Diesel were far better than the big Hollywood productions. Margin Call (2011; $3.5m production cost?) and packed with good actors proved a better story than Money Never Sleeps by far, even if it only represented a slice of events during the financial crisis.

At the end of the day the book version of Too Big To Fail (2009) tells the story most clearly (I don't know what to make of the movie. It's worth watching...but it seems to catch only the really key big events). Even the book, which is great on the core of the Lehman-AIG weekends, misses the entire run up to the crisis and how bankers and officials moved into position to create the mess.

We need a History of American Capitalism, 1987 - 2007 (or something like that) to be written.",1343692800,,4773,4.83108935128519
3968554,3,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore is one of the most cynical individuals in one of the most cynical of businesses:  entertainment.  In ""Capitalism:  A Love Story,"" Moore self-righteously attacks the American kleptocracy, while doing the very best that he can (with his pot-belly, lackadaisical demeanor, and scruffy clothes) to help us ignore the fact that he's one of the world's most famous filmmakers, and thus a certified member of the 1%.

Moore does make some good points in the film, but there are many more times when his credibility is questioned.  I've done quite a bit of reading, and I've never once heard that the rich were taxed 90% during the gilded age (quite frankly, there was no income tax before World War I), and that this money was used to build up America's middle-class through public expenditures in education and health care.  I've never heard about FDR's second Bill of Rights, one that guaranteed economic security to America's middle-class (wouldn't that make America socialist?).

Of course, hypocrisy and credibility issues have always shadowed Moore's career.  Unfortunately, this film is also boring.  It's entirely predictable and monotonous, and it seems like a rushed product to take advantage of the Occupy Wall Street movement.",1343433600,,1245,5.185

3968559,4,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore does it again. He researched this one quite well, talking to people whose farms and homes have been foreclosed, walking with his father over the empty ground where his father's 33-year job in a factory had taken place. He tried to get a real answer to the question ""What is a derivative?"" from both traders and academic economists. He documented the door and window factory that was closed by Bank of America, occupied by its workers because they hadn't gotten the pay they were owed, and then opened again as a co-op by those same workers. He toured the bakery in California which is a very successful co-op, and in fact I remember their bread fondly. He also went to the big Wall Street banks and asked for our money back, wrapping the entire block in a ""crime scene"" yellow tape.

Sure, some of the things he does are stunts, done for the publicity rather than for any serious impact. But that publicity IS serious impact. And interestingly, a majority of the 700 billion bailout has indeed been payed back by now.

One important point that may not have been made as clearly as it needed to be was the war over words that is tied up in the financial crisis. For too long, we developed a duck-and-cover mentality at the very mention of the word Socialism, let alone Communism. It's time we developed a healthy skepticism about Capitalism, too. The fact is, any of these ""economic theories"" which are touted as THE solution or THE problem are dangerous in their distilled form.

What we need, really, is pragmatism. Perhaps if we started capitalizing it and writing scholarly journal articles about it, that would help. But we need to look at each proposed change for its intended and unintended consequences, what alternatives might work better, how compromise might be reached. If we can't really fix the health care system without a single payer plan like Medicare for all, as I believe to be the case, then let's not be put off by the label ""socialized medicine.""",1336780800,2,1982,4.689655172413793

 The problem with Mikey's beloved socialism is that the entrepeneurs and go-getters quit working hard because it's just going to be taken away.  Besides, they can make a good living just letting the government take it away from some other dummy who is stupid enough to work hard.  socialism/communism usually doesn't work too well because the incentive to work has been removed, examples, Greece, Russia, Cuba.

What I like most about Michael's documentaries is that he uncovers information on the topics which he chooses to focus that you just do not find anywhere but in his documentaries. His movies reach across the spectrum to all age categories. He digs in and gets out more information than main stream media ever can or will. I may not always agree with his conclusions about the subject that he chooses, but I can say unequivocally that, I will definitely learn more new information about that subject than I would have without his presentation. Michael has this unique ability to get into and uncover information that just would not otherwise be found. He is a master of uncovering hidden and buried information! In this documentary Michael shows the the real effects of crony-capitalism. He raises some really compelling moral questions, in my mind, about the implementation of crony-capitalism (fascism) and our current de facto governmental system.

In this masterpiece of a film, Michael Moore sheds light on big business and its quest for even greater wealth at the expense of working people. Moore traces the roots of capitalism back many decades, and how the door for deregulation was swung open by our 40th president (Ronald Reagan). Despite warnings by the 39th president (Jimmy Carter), the culture of corruption was cemented and appears here to stay. As usual, Moore tells a sad story in a humorous way, and goes as far as yellow-taping a building as a crime scene. He also interviews airline pilots who are receiving food stamps, and how people's dignity has been crushed as a result of huge pay cuts. Finally, he shows how sophisticated trading schemes allow the rich to make billions of dollars on Wall Street, and how the housing market collapsed, and the resulting taxpayer-funded bailout.

3968594,5,B002QW7ALW,"I bought this movie for my husband, but I didn't particularly look forward to watching it.  Turns out, I loved watching it.  Whether you agree or disagree with the content, Michael Moore is just a darn good documentary film maker.  He makes his point clear and entertaining.  I don't think anyone watching a Michael Moore film is expecting a non-biased look at the issue of capitalism (and its failures) or at least I hope they're not.

In this film, Moore looks at some of the failures of our government - or politicians and corporations in particular - and also at some of the successes of private enterprises - employee-owned enterprises.  Moore succeeds because his view is a personal one and he makes no effort to hide that.  Not only does he not hide his bias, he flaunts it, by once again returning to his home town and interviewing his own father.  For him it's a personal story and he succeeds in making it feel like a personal story for the viewer as well.  And if you live in the United States, it should be a personal story for you... you just may or may not have the same personal view as Michael Moore.  Keeping those thoughts in mind, I found this to be a very informative (though biased) and thought-provoking film, as well as an entertaining one.",1319068800,4,1263,4.524229074889868

In fact, on a level of sheer entertainment, I'd say it's definitely a contender for his best.  He's got his guerrilla invasions of corporate headquarters and institutions down to a science, and he's certainly adept at pressing emotional button.  Moore's main problem is in his journalism.  Many of his main points reek of spin and he is not objective at all.  I know that he's not technically a journalist, but I think that his films target very serious topics that require pristine fact checking.

I won't make it, though, because he has never promised to do this. He's an original, and his passion for his beliefs drives the film. I found his argument compelling, and I especially enjoyed his take on the disconnect between capitalism and Christianity. This should be food for thought for anti-Moore conservatives, who generally equate capitalism and Christianity as bedrocks of The American Way without apparent thought to the disconnects between the two.

3968624,5,B002QW7ALW,"This film showed what irreversible damage has been done to our society and its people  by the venal few, when allowed free reign and without regulation. There are some wonderful points made. Moore gives numerous and fascinating vignettes of the tragic consequences of the powerful and greedy on ordinary lives. He comes over as a believer in the original principles of the founding father's of America, and in the principles that guide christian belief. He quite rightly plays the innocent abroad,a man curious to find out the truth - only because it is an effective way to communicate without layering the whole film with a personal diatribe of 'his own views'. He lets us make up our minds based on evidence we might not have been aware of before.

His repeated call at the end of the  film for 'us' to ""DO SOMETHING"" was spot on. I particularly liked the point about the scientist, Salk,  who discovered the Polio vaccine and refused to patent it for his own self interest. He could have been hugely wealthy, but rightly, gave the vaccine to the State to serve the people and save lives.  He personified the kind of rare selflessness that humanity needs now and much more than we might recognise.

I have come to really appreciate Michael Moore.  His stuff is deadly serious delivered under the guise of the questioning buffoon. It is brave, well researched, and deeply moving. He knits together a story of corporate greed and Government simony, with the dreadful impacts on individuals lives-particularly the voiceless poor. He uses eclectic examples which at first you don't think can be relevant, but successfully shows how unchecked Capitalist greed reaches into all areas of society. For example -he highlights news stories that pass by so rapidly in today's fast news agenda, to pull together the most damning indictment of the system's failure and horrors. There is the young people's correctional institution which makes the point so well. Here we are introduced to an $8 million facility, leased to State authorities. Moore interviews four young people, stunned and damaged by their experiences. Many of them were locked up for three times as long as their sentence allowed for minor infringements for which they should have only received a telling off. We meet vulnerable young people who were locked up for smoking a joint, or the girl who created a website that criticised the deputy head teacher at her school. They were locked up by a corrupt judge who lengthened sentences at will. They were sent to this private, for-profit correctional institution because the Judge was paid. The judge got paid for sending them customers!!! This was child abuse. It was stunningly shocking. Then we had the life insurances taken out on workers' lives by companies. They benefited from workers' deaths.

There were a few stories of co-operative working which lifted the spirits -the co operative bakers and other workers facing unemplpyment, who showed how things could be done differently.

The spotlight turned to the banks and their relationship with Government. The behaviour of the democratic party in supporting the Republican led $70 billion bailout was exposed. Paulson, Goldman Sachs, and their control of the Executive in Government still leaves me speechless however many times I hear about it. The stream of foreclosures, through state after state- were spotlighted. We saw the despair of the sick, elderly small farmer , encouraged to refinance who finds his payments doubling then tripling. He is evicted with nowhere to go. We see how refinancing was packaged and sold by such companies as Countrywide. The former farmer and his wife earn their last dollars by empyting their own home for the finance company who had sold it to someone else. It was cheaper for the company if the evicted couple cleared the house than to hire a professional house clearance company. The couple desperately needed the small amount of money this brought. This was a lesson in the ultimate humiliation which rampant greedy Capital and its officials are prepared to deliver. Talk about putting the boot in. Truly heartbreaking.  These tragic stories are countered with stories of fighting back. (We see the homeless Miami family taking over an empty property backed by community support.) But the fighting back has not really begun in earnest yet.

People talk about Moore being wealthy now from making movies.  I am glad he is wealthy. He can use the money to make more movies. He is still of the people. Money can often divorce people from their roots, but that hasn't happened to Moore yet. He is still the only one making populist rather than elitist documentaries that successfully communicate with the many. That Michael Moore was able to make this movie in America gives hope. Made in 2009, it needs updating, particularly on Obama's hands being tied by Capital's lobbying powers.

Moore offers a more popular and accessible overview of derivatives. It is an everyman's guide,which is necessary. He does it very well. ( For a clearer focus on the causes of the financial crash and the individuals in banks and their links with Government, see 'Inside Job'. This is a very good fast-paced and detailed doc made in 2010 which looks at the causes of the failures and on the actions of bankers and their friends in Government. It takes a more detailed look at packaged derivatives, Credit Default Swaps, Credit Default Obligations and Ratings agencies).

Many Americans have been brainwashed into believing that Socialism equals Communism and that Stalin was a socialist. Socialism has always meant Capitalism with a social face. What is wrong with that? There were a lot of people in this programme who caused this crisis and who actually loathe socialism because it shares out profits. (There is one rich man who says on camera that he won;t give up a piece of his pie. ""I want all my pie"" he says. I hope it chokes him.  Socialism is not an economic system. Capitalism is. But Capitalism can only survive if it serves the interests of all people not a few as we are now seeing. Capitalism can't survive in a country that has ever increasing unemployment and low wages. Who buys the goods?

The sovereign debt crisis has not played out yet. That will be the next chapter in Capital's crisis. More Moore of this kind of vintage please.",1310860800,3,6336,4.929643527204503

He taps into the mistrust and hurt feelings that a large group of Americans feel when they fall behind on their mortgages or lose their jobs.  Moore never criticizes a borrower for borrowing more than they can afford or not knowing the terms of a mortgage.  Still, I agree the lenders were at fault too, with some glaring examples in sub prime lending.

He doesn't report that the TARP program actually made money for the government (this probably wasn't clear at the time this movie was made).  I thought the part about pilots being underpaid was common knowledge.  Who's to blame for this, Mr Moore?  Capitalism, I guess, but it doesn't seem realistic that this will change.  Simple supply and demand.  It's not like airlines are making tons of money.  They are constantly in and out of bankruptcy.  Moore seems to long for the days when the top tax rate was 90%.  If this were the case today, the rich would flee the nation in droves.

Moore idealizes unions, yet benefit-hungry unions and compliant management ground GM into the ground as health plans for workers became too rich.

It seemed exploitive to film a family mourning the loss of their mother/wife under the pretence that Walmart profited from her death by taking life insurance out on her.  The children miss their mom, yet it was portrayed as though they were stricken by Walmart's profiteering.  Still, that was an enlightening issue, that employers sometimes take life insurance on their employees.  Seems callous to me.

All-in-all a decent movie, but the real issues are nuanced, and Moore's arguments are not.  He's a populist and a propagandist, and that's fine, that's his shtick.

3968636,5,B002QW7ALW,"This may be one of the most important movies made in the last decade. For me, reviewing a Michael Moore movie positively represents almost a seismic shift in ideology. Just last year I was still a pro-life, pro-marriage conservative. I am still pro-life, I still believe marriage to be between a man and a woman, but I have absolutely come to reject the party that for so long I thought represented me. I watched this movie after this ideological trip, but it confirmed for me that the change in my thinking was correct, and that I had changed my mind for the right reasons.

Like Mr. Moore, I was aghast at the bail-out of Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. I found it abominable that enough tax payer dollars to pay off every mortgage in America were given away for free to our nation's richest, and most irresponsible, class: Wall Street Bankers.

I thought for awhile that radical conservatives, such as Ron Paul, had the correct solution. However, once I read more deeply and saw how anti-union, anti-worker, and even anti-civil rights these radical libertarian conservatives were I rejected them out of hand. I had studied Ayn Rand in graduate school, and I had long been of the mind that libertarianism was both flawed and evil. Social Darwinism is a repulsive concept.

So, where to turn? If union-busting free-traders who advocated the destruction of the American middle class (and therefore the traditional family) were to be rejected, and pro-death anti-traditional marriage Democrats were to be rejected, what was the answer?

I do not know. The only thing I do know is that Mr. Moore has made a compelling film, deeply rooted not just in social justice, but in the faith he and I both share (Catholicism). I am uncomfortable with Mr. Moore's social liberalism, and his inclusion of the disgraced Bishop Gumbleton in this documentary, but I am not in any way (like some of our conservative co-religionists are) compelled to reject this man or his work. He uses humor and satire to clearly communicate the weaknesses with the predominant culture. In this sense, his work for me bears a resemblance to G.K. Chesterton's. There is even a similarity in appearance between the two men which I find compelling!

I am grateful that Mr. Moore allows his faith to guide his work. He is an amazing film maker, and a deep thinker. Most importantly, he gets us to think. He approaches his work through the lens of faith; he goes to Mass, and tries to put his faith into the world.

What else could one possibly ask? Of course, that he becomes pro-life, and that he realizes that abortion is a big-business that benefits only the rich. Perhaps he will come to that realization someday. One can only hope. Until then, I think his work on economics, and his work on this film, is important and deeply rooted in truth.

Thank you Mr. Moore, for your outstanding work.

Addenda: (added April 1st)

While I refuse to delete this review, or run away from it, I heard a very disturbing interview this evening with Mr. Moore. He stance on abortion, and his view of pro-lifers in specific, is extreme in its lack of charity, and in its pro-death bias. This is so sad. Our country is falling apart, in no small measure, because people are afraid to speak truth and be prophetic, or are unable to be charitable towards those with whom they disagree. Elitists on the left (like Moore) and on the right (like George Weigel) are too arrogant to think critically about the whole of what Christ and the Church stand for.

Sad, sad sad. Mr. Moore's work will forever be flawed by his pro-death ideology. What is the use of our right to a job, or our right to a living wage, if we do not even enjoy the right to life?

Real Americans are getting desperate. We want leadership that is competent, both morally and fiscally. We, as a whole, REJECT the notion that babies should be slaughtered in the womb at any point during pregnancy. We REJECT the notion that marriage is just about adults and not children. However, the democratic party (and people like Mr. Moore) want to pretend that these reasonable and defensible positions are extreme or wrong.

Thus, the democratic party loses election after election. They are so enamored of the killing of infants (which is what abortion is) and degrading the institution of marriage that they do not care a whit for the reasonable positions of many Americans. People like me are almost forced to vote Republican, even though every stance the Republican party takes on issues like the environment, or workers rights, or foreign policy, trouble us deeply.

Mr. Moore: WAKE UP. Abortion is an industry! It is an industry that makes massive amounts of money taking advantage of (and often harming physically) poor women! Women deserve better! Put your faith into action completely, or many will simply not listen to the GOOD things you have to say!",1299888000,4,4882,4.729411764705882

Also he does not give options, just one where  a factory is own and worked by the owners, to make profit ( on what ever amount could be made, which is based on how well you serve your customers and not by greed as he intends to put it. And by the way is the original idea of capitalism( Make profit, any form of it, to go from a situation to a better situation, not mixing any emotions. This is human nature.) I would recommend this video  to learn about Mercantilism, and to Mr. Moore to read more about terms and words before making a video with such ""unknown words"". Also he does not give alternatives of systems, which is part of a good problem debate. The video is really entertaining and informative. You can add knowledge  to your whole concepts of the world.

- looks at why GM has failed compared to German and Japanese rivals,

- flashes back to the Financial Crisis of '08/'09 with footage of senators revolting in Congress about the bailout.

He also shows stirring footage of:
- widows and widowers who had policies taken out against their late spouses by their former employers
- families being evicted from their homes after 4 decades

3968641,2,B002QW7ALW,"I've just finished watching Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story, and have to admit that I found it to be a confusing and frustrating attempt to attack the notion of capitalism. Additionally, I found the filmmaking to be poor, as there really is no central narrative and Moore presents his case, which is difficult to actually piece together, in the form of semi-related instances with little to no background explanation.

My biggest problem with the film is that it is not about capitalism. In fact, the entire film can be viewed as an argument FOR capitalism, as every example that Moore reports on can be traced to the American government's intervention in the free market. Similarly, the social issues he bemoans usually come as results of free market inhibitions, NOT the markets themselves. For example, Moore's two biggest cases against ""capitalism"" are the absurdly low wages of airline pilots and the government bailout of Wall Street in 2008, but airlines are one of the most heavily regulated industries in America, and a government bailout of the private sector is the exact opposite of capitalism. In a capitalist system, the market itself would determine pilot wages, and the banks involved in the crash would have collapsed.

These are just a couple of examples, but that notion is present in almost everything Moore does. He uses shock value and popular examples of disparity to engender an emotional response, but these scenes usually allow for viewers to draw conclusions that are not only contradictory to Moore's central charge against capitalism, but are oftentimes contradictory to one another.

Moreover, he makes several absurd claims without any explanation or back-up. At one point, he actually says, ""capitalism is an evil,"" not long after he makes a claim supporting the post-WWII German government's prescription that, in times of need, the state can seize the means of production and command the economy. First of all, that would be a nightmare. Secondly, though, this heavy support for government intervention in the markets is directly at odds with his condemnation of the Wall St bailouts. It just doesn't make any sense.

In the end, he throws in some videos of Obama rallies, and closes with Hurricane Katrina. There doesn't seem to be any reason for the Katrina footage, other than to make the claim that ""it's never the Wall Street bankers that this happens to."" The movie just devolves into a cluttered mess, from which it is nearly impossible to draw any meaningful conclusion.

I gave it two stars for the humor value. Moore gets some laugh for parading around Wall St with a money sack like an idiot, demanding billions of dollars, and then cordoning off the area as a crime scene.

3968664,5,B002QW7ALW,"Basically everybody has given you the basic idea of this film so I will not.  But I do want to make one comment about those who claim Michael Moore is a liar.  We all know that in recent years the at Michael Moore has attacked the conservative movement and many claim he is a liar because of that.  And since that is the case boy am I glad to hear that he is a liar in this film to since he blames the entire situation on both parties.  That is right on this film Moore does not take a side.  And in all honesty my son did a similar film almost 3 years ago (Before the Bank Bailouts.)  Although his mostly did with the way the news media was approaching the subject of Illegal Immigration, he too discovered a link that Michael Moore also stated in this film (The corruption of business started when unknown forces started taking control of the White House towards the end of Jimmy Carter's Term, and the downfall started shortly after Reagan became president.",1295740800,2,960,4.335195530726257
3968665,1,B002QW7ALW,"What we have in American is NOT capitalism and certainly is NOT free markets. We have corporatism/fascism. It is the merging of corporations and the government. There are 50+ people in high ranking positions in our government that have either former employment/strong ties to Goldman Sachs. This is no secret. Obama, the puppet, has completely surrounded himself with nothing but Wall Street people. The Fed (a central bank) has raped the American people for trillions of dollars by creating money out of thin air and inflating the dollar. Moore attempts to bash capitalism and then pushes socialism/communism in a typical bait and switch fashion. Do NOT fall for it. This is pure propaganda meant to prop up Big Government and the to fascist state. This does not mean that the right is any better, but socialism and communism are the absolute worst forms of government.

Government is the most inefficient manager of money in world history. Examples in this country of socialism are Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, etc. All of these take money from all to benefits others. They are entirely bankrupt and dragging our economy down with it. Social Security is the largest Ponzi Scheme in world history. People that do not receive benefits are paying directly for the benefits of those that do receive them. It is NOT a retirement fund and it is NOT a trust. If you want some real truth about the government, capitalism, the Fed, etc., then read Ron Paul's books and avoid the Hollywood propaganda that supports an agenda that has amount to $14+ trillion in national debt. Every single dollar that you and I pay in federal income taxes goes directly to pay the INTEREST on the national debt. It does not go to ANY services that we would expect to receive for this $2 Trillion in taxation. People will say, ""How will we pay for roads and schools?"" Roads are paid for with the gasoline tax and schools are paid for with property taxes. Knowledge and the truth is key here. Do your research and learn what is REALLY going on...not what Hollywood tells you what is going on. Any truthful documentaries about the government will NEVER make it to the silver screen. This has already been proven when the government went after Mark Cuban for attmepting to bring a hard hitting documentary to theatres.",1295395200,30,2297,4.82994923857868

Before the film, the crowd sipped champagne and cocktails in the ""Morgan Stanley Lobby"" and then headed to their seats in the ""Citi Balcony."" Movie tickets were available at the ""Bank of New York Box Office"" and there's outdoor seating at the ""Credit Suisse

Moore's overall conclusion: ""Capitalism is an evil and you can't regulate evil. You have to replace it with something that is good for everyone."" And he suggests replacing the current system, not with socialism, but with a true democracy in which the masses vote out government officials who are in the pocket of the powerful and wealthy elite. Moore suggests that the big turnout in the 2008 election indicates that ""one man, one vote"" still means something.",1295136000,,1047,5.046242774566474

The question explored in the film, however, is a darn good one: Who gave the corporate/financial/political classes all the power and why don't we the people take it back?",1294012800,2,299,5.382978723404255
3968669,5,B002QW7ALW,"There really isn't much more to say once you see this film. You should be mad and actually downright on the verge of taking up arms and forming community 'groups' for lack of a better term to do something about some of this, but ...

you won't.

And that's the saddest reality and the most painful message in all of this. Add in that the folks that Michael Moore is talking about have successfully turned his name into a symbol of the ultimate pariah making this very clear message even harder to be acknowledged, injested and acted upon.

The infrastructure that Moore is reporting upon used to run in fear that this kind of information would be privvy to the mainstream media, but these days they've already figured where everybody stands, how much stomach most people have to fight and by keeping everyone hard at work, it'll make it harder for them to seek out the barest amount of respect in the world for themselves and their families. They know that - for you - the viewer, it's just more consumable media that you'll entertain yourselves with so that you can sleep in a numb haze at night and forget that this place is really in for darker times in the near short term.

I read most of the negative reviews of this film and it really is hard to nay-say the information or try to GOP coat-tail and uphold the 'dead peasant' insurance policies, the massive lay-off's during economic booms and the out-right unethical looting that took place by Wall Street ... unless of course you're Tucker Carlson or some other emotionally detached human being with a huge trust-fund or just grossly uneducated in common sense or basic ecomonics.

The fact that this film has been out for some time and a lot of people have never even seen it, or wanted to see it, should be an indication as to what's really going on around us. Yes, I finally included myself in this.

There's a scene where a little dog is jumping up and down at the dinner table hoping for some food scraps from their owner to fall their way and Moore equates those folks struggling for their vision of the American Dream to be that dog, and the bankers and corporations are the people looking at the dog and doing everything they can to keep the dog in its place. Quite fitting and quite simple.

It doesn't matter how you feel about Michale Moore, because you should put that aside and watch this film. You'll learn that he, too, is an American and his father worked in an American factory his whole life giving Michael and his siblings the ideal American life. Michael started his life in film-making by trying to document what went on in the Automobile industry during the Reagan years and which now, has come full circle and fully played itself out - and in the worst possible scenario imaginable.

This is a really difficult film to watch because Ronald Reagan isn't the hero, Jimmy Carter becomes the  voice of doom, the death of FDR becomes the turning point in American History for the worst, Bill Clinton sets up some of the pieces of the puzzle that makes the nightmare possible and George Bush just doubles down on all of it multiplying our troubles ad infinitum. This is not a happy film and you're left to just hate the situation and all those involved and there is no answer at the end. This whole thing goes down like Henry V, but with a horrible outcome where Scroop, Grey and Westmoreland actually succeed in selling out the country for loose coin.

The film is like the Chimes at Midnight. Some say ""Well, then why watch it?"" Because you must.

Despite the liberal bias, what stands out in this movie, and his others, is his obvious concern for the average American.  He portrays just how the average worker is being forced to work more and more while their corporate bosses feed off of them with their large bonuses, etc.  He calls our society not a democracy but a plutocracy.  He uses humor to make this enjoyable, but it skewers those he makes fun of which I thoroughly enjoyed.  This is a must see.",1293580800,5,613,4.4375

While no one is claiming that what he is saying is 100% right, however, it certainly is though-provoking and concerning the well being of human kind. Just like Fehreneit 9/11, this documentary is based on facts, and brings about things are generally are hidden (on purpose) from ordinary people.

3968684,5,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore poses the question : Why are capitalism and democracy so intertwined that mentioning one without the other is heresy and that even fiddling with or fine tuning capitalism is un-American . The answer seems to be that the very wealthy want it that way . The hard work ethic is a nice little piece of Americana  ,but the fact is people who work the hardest make the least amount of money . Hard work doesn't make money ....money makes money . The American dream .. life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness seems to have been high jacked by banks and corporations .
This movie is an equal opportunity offender . Both dems and the GOP get ripped to shreds . Christopher Dodd is made mince meat of . Reagan is presented as a corporate spokesperson  , Pelosi is portrayed as an aider and abettor and Bush is quite accurately portrayed as a moron . The people that get hit hardest are bankers - Schkeevatsos like Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson  ...in fact the only person that comes out looking good in all of this is good old FDR .
It's a fun look at our economic system and how we accept ideologies and principles we've had drummed into our heads from the time we're 5 years old .

A scene from Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus Of Nazareth .

There are many valuable things this documentary teaches you. From Citibank's prospectus to it's clients to the overtaking of public households, the film is a great study of America's journey through yesteryears.

Watching a Michael Moore is always like learning the most valuable lesson about America noone will ever tell you. In Capitalism, Michael reigns supreme and brings forward in his trademark style a remarkable description of the way forward for this country and the impact of Capitalism on America.

Its stunning how accurate the film is despite being based on a vast topic, it is very well emphasized. I became a fan of Moore after Sicko which remains his best work.

He questions everything we've ever been taught about capitalism and clearly points out how capitalism has run amok in this country. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the banks and big-business corporations are making tremendous profits off the backs of the tax-payers. There may be nothing we can do about it (yet), but at least Mr. Moore has made us aware of what's happened to our economy, who started our downhill slide, why they started it, and the convoluted political ploys that were used to accelerate it.

THE MILITARY.  WHAT'S THE STAT?  NOW THERE'S MORE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS LIKE BLACKHAWK HAVING MORE MILITARY FOR HIRE than we have soldiers  and they're killing civilians and running their little private prositution rings, all at taxpapers expense...and now that we've found out that Iraq was manufactured to help elect the worst president in U.S. history his job, it's amazing that there are still many on the right at all...except that we have a black president...and that may trump everything.
The big money that has been being funnelled into the tea party people is ironic since it is a very tiny per cent of Americans who make over $200,000. a year so MOST of those tea party people don't even know which side their bread's buttered on, because that big money is behind the tea partiers.
Moore helps anyone see....who wants to  that yes, government could get smaller...and certainly taxes could do.......but the most important thing is where does our money go?  I don't want my money going to help the rich...they're doing pretty ok in this country...I don't want welfare for the haves, something that George Bush actually said in another one of Moore's films..  When GW was at a big bash in D.C. he said ""you're my people.  There are the haves and the have nots and we're the haves"".  Well, the Republicans and the turn coat blue dog white guys have given up America to the haves.... Those with money say they don't like welfare but their tax breaks are government welfare...when they commit crimes and get off easy, their dough is buying them a type of protective welfare.  When they DON'T SEND THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS off to fight in wars we don't need to be in because THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS GET JOBS A WHOLE BUNCH EASIER cause of who their daddies or daddies and mommies are, that's a kind of prejudicial welfare...
Those who hate the unions don't know how extremely necessary those unions were for so long.  If you trust management more than the union, you're foolish.

3968689,5,B002QW7ALW,"A superlative documentary and probably the best Michael Moore has produced so far which should be compulsory material in school and university curriculi not only in the States but also in Europe; alas the major media owned by Murdoch and his fellow oligarchs in the US and Europe continue to ignore this outrageous master piece! Capitalism  describes vividly and funnily at times through eloquent images of decent hardworking Americans and authoritative testimonies by academic, political and church representatives how predatory and immoral financial capitalism has replaced productive capitalism , ruining millions of families in the process and the real economy.

All this happened  whilst scores of Wall Street crooks and criminals became rich beyond belief thanks to the banking/financial deregulation they and their accomplices in Washington pushed through the White House particularly under Clinton's presidency. The same people who orchestrated and benefited from this financial looting have been appointed by Obama to resolve the problem they created!! So much for a President who promised change but is obviously in the service of his oligarch friends/supporters instead of serving the interests of the American people including the millions who trusted him! Except for Madoff no criminal prosecution has been initiated by Obama's Justice Department against any of the dishonest banksters and regulators who benefited from this latest financial bubble.

Particularly compelling are the testimonies (Special features of the DVD) of Harvard Prof. E.Warren, Prof. W. Black  and Journalist/Writer C. Hedges  3 honourable and distinguished Americans who dare to condemn in no uncertain terms the arrogant and criminal nature of this parasitic type of capitalism which robs with impunity the wealth created by others .

Capitalism a Love story is an ideal and intelligent gift to make and  should be shown on all the oligarch controlled mainstream media (wishful thinking of course) in order to hopefully  stop and punish the criminal oligarch parasites who are responsible for the economic devastation and financial misery we are witnessing today in the US and Europe.",1287705600,4,2173,5.5606060606060606
3968690,4,B002QW7ALW,"One problem with Capitalism is the misapprehensions people have about it.
Firstly, its not a 'system' (something Moore makes the mistake of calling it). All it is is letting people behave without restriction in an economy (just as Free speech is letting people speak without restriction.)
Second is that, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Churchill/dp/1405006579/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Churchill</a>&nbsp;said about democracy, it is the ""worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried from time to time.""

And these are two issues that prevent me giving this film the full 5 stars. Yes - it is a compelling critique and makes a number of good points (e.g. about Pilots being paid less that $20,000 a year & Dead Peasants insurance), but Moore really fails in some of his thinking.

Several examples, the first being foreclosures. Though foreclosures have become far too commonplace in the US, Moore does not make this clear in his film, but instead goes on the offensive against the very idea that people can be turned out of their homes for not paying their bills. Yes - it is cruel to throw people out at short notice, but not throwing non-payers out *ever* is also bad. Surely there is a balance, but this is nowhere made clear.
Second, Moore makes out that socialism is an alternative system, rather than just being an adaptation of what is already there. Systems that go for pure socialism tend to have little ability to generate Wealth and so fail (even Fidel Castro has begun admitting this recently). Again, its a balancing act, and not one system vs another.
Third, Moore has big issues with lay-offs and even makes the false correlation that General Motor's lay-offs in the 80's lead to bankrupcy in the 2000's. Truth is that big companies have to lay-off people to stay competitive and, even if fat-cat bonuses could be trimmed, that wouldn't mean that you should good money after bad and keep loss-making plants open.

Anyways, aside from those issues, I really enjoyed this film and found it refreshing to see someone stand up for the principles of Roosevelt and Liberal democracy.
In an ideal World, all of Moore's ideas would be implementable and Heaven might dawn on Earth. As things are, there are only a few ideas of his that hit home, but these all have great potency.

For instance, Why does America not have more workers cooperatives? Why not tax the 1% richest more? And, most importantly, how dare the rich claim that their accumulation of wealth is in line with the teachings of Christ?

And since few others are offering alternative arguments like Moore's (with the exception of the slightly crazy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zeitgeist/dp/3940845647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zeitgeist</a>, the sadly overlooked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Corporation/dp/B000P1KTEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Corporation</a>&nbsp;and the immortal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bill-Hicks/dp/B003A4GBJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bill Hicks</a>), then I do recommend all and sundry to watch this film.

His expose' on the often quite ugly underbelly of our winner-takes-all approach to wealth accumulation has some truly eye-opening segments, such as exposing the practice by some corporations of taking out insurance policies on lower-rung employees that provide them the benefits when employees die.

Going in, you have to realize that Moore has an agenda and his goal is to persuade you to see his vision. He does this primarily with his creative use of the camera, dramatic music, and showing heart wrenching scenes of despair. What makes him a good filmmaker is that he also digs deeper into the issues. While some of these issues are well known (1% of the world having most of the wealth, record corporate earnings partly achieved by massive layoffs, stagnation of wages), further issues such as the poor wages of airline pilots, credit default swaps, and company insurance policies on their employees while listing themselves as the beneficiary are far more disturbing. Moore plays both the political card and morality card to the hilt throughout, especially with his anti-George Bush stance. The examples of justice such as the Chicago factory workers fighting to get the money owed to them when their company closed provide a nice touch and show what can happen when you unite and fight for what's right.

By examining the details and real-life consequences of Capitalism, this movie puts a spotlight on how utterly ridiculous, unfair and unsustainable this doctrine is.

3968711,5,B002QW7ALW,"I had previously considered ""Bowling For Columbine"" to be Michael Moore's masterpiece; but after watching ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" I must relegate that earlier work to second place.  ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is a truly exceptional piece of work, superbly crafted and outstandingly effective; it strips the mask off Capitalism so leisurely and non-chalantly, yet so completely, that only the most die-hard proponents of that monstrously overrated economic system can still claim to accept it at face value or see it as anything other than the most insidious and pervasive system of exploitation of the poor by the rich ever devised.  Above all else, it lays bare once and for all the simple-minded notion of ""Free Market.""  As Mr Moore shows, this ""Free Market"" is bought and paid for lock-stock-and-barrel by the super rich; the ""market"" is no more ""free"" than the gold bars languishing in a bank vault.
It is, in fact, precisely the banks that Mr Moore uses as his wedge to pry open the capitalistic bag of tricks being foisted continually on an unsuspecting and uninformed public.  While he presents the ""Bank Bailout"" as the enormous fraud it actually was, he goes beyond that to present the entire spectrum of capitalistic activities as one big fraud after another.  He makes perfectly clear what the public once understood then quickly forgot as they became more affluent; namely, that it was the labor movement and not the largesse of the rich that created the middle class.  Now that the labor movement is all but dead, the real nature of the American people's relationship to the capitalistic paradigm is beginning to reveal itself once again. And it isn't pretty.
Mr Moore's ""Achilles Heel"" as a filmmaker has always been a tendency to overplay the pathos inherent in the anecdotal stories of people who have been stripped of their livelihood, their homes and their dignity by the system.  I credit him, this time, with knowing when to stop short of languishing too long on the pathos, focusing instead on the larger picture of thousands, even millions, of people getting stuck permanently with the short end of the big ""trickle down"" stick because of their foolish but carefully sublimated belief that they, too, can become as rich as the super rich.
This documentary achieves one other, ironic if unintended, goal: it gives the lie to documentarian Alex Jones' spurious contention that Michael Moore is a dupe of the bankers.  Jones contends that, because Moore did not suscribe to the idea that ""911"" was an inside job in his ""Farenheit 911,"" he is ipso facto a pawn of the bankers.  Far from being a pawn, though, Michael Moore, in his ""Capitalism: A Love Story,"" deals more expeditiously with the bankers than all of Alex Jones' films put together - and does so without straying into the realm of pure conjecture.  Which is precisely why Moore has managed to preserve his credibility, whereas Jones - an equally gifted documentarian - has all but squandered his.",1283644800,3,2980,4.930139720558882

Citigroup (a major financial services company based in New York) declared in 2005 and 2006 that:

""The U.S. was no longer really a democracy but had become a plutonomy, a society controlled exclusively by and for the benefit of the top 1% of the population who now have more financial wealth than the bottom 95% combined.""

(Democracy is a political form of government where governing power is derived FROM THE PEOPLE.)

The above fact is found in this eye-opening documentary written by, directed by, produced by, and starring Michael Moore.  Moore is an American film maker, author, and liberal political commentator.

This film focuses on the financial crisis of (2007 to 2010) and the recovery stimulus.  It examines the current economic order in the United States and capitalism in general.

(Capitalism is an economic system where the means of production and distribution are privately owned and operated for profit.)

General topics covered in this film include:

(1) Wall Street's ""casino mentality""
(2) for-profit prisons
(3) Goldman Sachs' influences in Washington, DC.  (Goldman Sachs is a very financially successful global investment banking and securities firm)
(4) the poverty level wages of many workers.  (Example: why do we have an economic system ""that allows a pilot to be paid less than a manger at Taco Bell?"")
(5) the large number of home foreclosures. (A foreclosure is a legal procedure that may require forced sale of property.)
(6) the consequences of ""runaway greed.""

There is even a religious component to this documentary.  Here, Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a sin and if Jesus would be a capitalist!!

Yes, this film has Moore's sometimes corny humour but I feel this film will leave viewers with much to ponder and debate.

Be sure to watch the end credits.  Interspersed between them are facts and quotes.  My two favourite quotes are:

(1) ""I sincerely believe...that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.""  (Thomas Jefferson, 1816)

(2) ""It's class warfare, my class is winning but they shouldn't be."" (Warren Buffet, world's richest person, 2007)

This documentary has grossed over sixteen million dollars as of the date of this review.

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2010) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has several interesting extras.

In conclusion, this is an unforgettable and sometimes shocking documentary.  Moore concludes at its end that ""Capitalism is evil.""  I DISAGREE.  If you're a member of the top 1% of the population who are filthy rich, capitalism is a ""blessing.""

Michael Moore is good at getting to the truth behind the lies and i thank him for that, We are the other 98% and i think it's our turn to be heard!!!",1281312000,2,311,3.9523809523809526
3968734,3,B002QW7ALW,"Let me take the moment to give you TWO THINGS about this movie that made me take TWO STARS away from the five-star review it could of received...but first, let me make a disclaimer about Mr. Moore:

The last time I considered myself a ""liberal"" was for about a semester in college when I was interning under a ""liberal"" professor.  Prior to that I was always conservative-minded...and pretty much still am, every college student goes through some sort of liberal phase.  That being said, I think Michael Moore has always made great movies.  Even though I don't agree with gun control, universal health care, or socialism, I still feel his films have provided an education on government and corporate corruption that a mass audience can enjoy while being enlightened.  Moore's solutions are always a little too idealistic for my tastes, but I'm glad he has been there for 20+ years to be an agent of critical thinking to the general public.

That being said, here is what I DISLIKED about ""Capitalism: A Love Story"".  (I am not going to talk about what I liked or agreed with in the film, because that was pretty much everything except for what I am about to mention).

First, I take a star away because this film seems to try to be anti-capitalism when it's real target is NOT capitalism but corruption WITHIN capitalism.  Wal-Mart taking out life insurance policies on employees, privatized penal systems, and job-loss due to outsourcing are not default results of capitalism.  These are examples of the greed and violation that occurs when capitalism leads to single entities having too much power.  However, if it were not for capitalism, well, lets just say Michael Moore might have to show his movies after midnight in very private places to very select audiences.

Next, and this is the BIGGEST flaw of ""Capitalism"", I take a star away because of the severe [...]that Barrack Obama gets in the last third of this movie.  I am not sure what the future holds for President Obama's legacy, but I do know that it is absolutely ludicrous to call a guy a saint before he has done a single thing.  Also, take a look at guys like Paulson and Geitner...they still have jobs under Obama, don't they?  In fact, aren't they more powerful under Obama?  Read the news, day after day you'll see that Mr. Obama is putting more and more power in the hands of Wall Street cronies and the Federal Reserve.

I feel that Michael Moore is terribly mistaken in putting so much trust into the man who would be president.  The reality is that Barrack Obama and the Democratic party are a different face to the same beast that employed George Bush and Bill Clinton.  Powerful bankers, corrupt judges, lobbyists, greedy globalists...the presidents have carried out the bidding of these schmuck's since Kennedy was assassinated.  Obama is no savior to the ailments of capitalism, he is just another sap who sold his soul to the evil machine.",1281225600,92,2919,4.753968253968254
3968735,1,B002QW7ALW,"Say this about Michael Moore: He's consistent.

In his latest offering ""Capitalism: A Love Story"", Mr. Moore takes us on a journey into pure emotionalism and sensationalism only to arrive at the obvious conclusion: European socialism rules.

Some key points:

He spends quite a bit of time on the major banks (or big monster mega banks as Clark Howard refers to them as) and their complicity in the financial meltdown, including the mortgage crises.  He shows us images of people being kicked out of their homes that the bank has foreclosed on.  Very emotional, yet we are given very little detail as to what circumstances led to these individuals losing their home. The banks were wrong for issuing home loans to unqualified borrowers, however equal blame must be assessed to the people that signed the contract for a loan on a house they obviously couldn't afford and a federal government that guaranteed these loans in the guise of ""Everyone has the right to own a home"".

Newsflash: You do not have the right to own a home if you can't afford it.

He rightfully demonstrates examples of low life individuals who take advantage of the system.  One such example shows 2 judges that were taking money from a private company that actually runs the local junvenille hall.  The ""incarceration rate"" went up as a result of this, even for relatively minor offenses.  Yes this is disgusting, however how is the representative of all capitalism?

And so it is with this ""documentary"".  Moore shows us one off examples of obvious greed and complete disregard for humanity and then expects us to conclude that these examples are the norm for all capitalists.  His solution?  We should switch to the European socialist model.  Yes that will solve everything.  Because Europe is doing so well with this system, well except for Greece and Spain, but don't worry yourself with those countries, it's just a temporary glitch until the TRUE socialism can take root.

Finally his display of Obama winning the election as some sort of populist victory is laughable at best.  Obama has surrounded himself with some of the same Wall Street people that helped get us into this mess.  Obama is a crony capitalist, not an idealogical socialist as so many have painted him as on the right.

The bottom line with this film is that if you are looking for a serious examination of the financial meltdown and it's causes and possible solutions, you won't find it here.  If you are interesting in an emotional one sided ""power to the people"" 2 hour extravaganza, this movie will fit that bill perfectly.",1280707200,49,2575,4.82004555808656
3968736,4,B002QW7ALW,"I gave this 4 stars because it is entertaining but, once again, Moore condemns something he benefits from.  Not only would he be banned from criticizing the government in a Marxist state but he would be in prison.  I wish people would think critically when watching his films.",1280448000,,276,4.729166666666667
3968737,4,B002QW7ALW,"First, although this documentary was just released last year it already has a dated feel to it, as governmental regimes have changed but not the greedy profit motive that drives the capitalist economy and which the twin governmental parties of capitalism, Republican and Democratic, each in their way, serve. Moore's main object at the time, I assume, was to take advantage, easy advantage as the case turned out, of the villainous characters that ran the capitalist government under President Bush, under whose regime all economic hell broke loose. That was then, and this is now though. The easily interchangeable cast of characters now look remarkable the same, the wars the same, unemployment still at modern day highs, Wall Street bonuses obscene, Congress still  under the thumb (as Moore, in his great film-making capacity, really captures)  under new ""go to"" guy Obama. Sure, plenty of people had (and still have) plenty of illusions in Obama so Brother Moore was not alone, although some of the others had enough sense not to film their glee for the world to see and  thus have to shield their faces from public view  when the inevitable shoe fell.

Second, one of the central motifs here is Moore's notion that this country can turn itself around by going back to some form of Rooseveltian ""New Deal (his Second Bill Of Rights). But his big push is for social and political action by the ""little people."" (Called by Moore, and others, the middle class, although it is really called the working class, brother, at least from the film footage interviews from such towns as Detroit and Cleveland. There is nothing wrong with calling a thing by its right name, okay?) Moore makes several plugs (including at the end) for people to ""do something.""  Unfortunately, such a vague statement in politics can be turned on you. In a racist-tinged, anti-immigrant, starve public services (part of which is directed at those same two groups) ""Age of the Tea Party"", political action by the ""little people"" is not always without a program, a socialist program, the kind of clarion call to action that he was looking for. So political programmatic clarity, always in short supply with Moore, is a must.

Finally, although I didn't notice it as much on the first viewing Moore's worldview is informed by an almost Catholic Workers movement-like (formed in the old Great Depression days by  Dorothy Day and others, and later included followers like the Berrigan brothers and many ex-priests and ex-nuns) sensibility. Now, as I, perhaps, have mentioned before Dorothy Day was revered in my childhood home, especially by my devout, pious poor mother. So I can thus sense, as that spark also drove part of my own social education, the origins of  the quest for justice in Moore's work, if not for his conclusions. But Brother Moore that was long ago, and I was just I kid. Grownups fight, and fight hard, under a more progressive banner than the Democrats offer, or ever offered.",1279670400,,2968,4.908183632734531
3968738,4,B002QW7ALW,"This documentary is Mr. Moore's latest commentary on the American business community.  Made in the wake of the real estate bubble burst and the onset of the ""Great Recession"", this movie feels like a sequel to Mr. Moore's previous hit ""Roger and Me"".  This time, he focuses on Wall Street and the major US banks.  He zooms in on the TARP bailout, and highlights some of the abuses of the money.  There is also a great section on how corporations often buy life insurance on their employees, betting that these employees would then die.  The movie ends on a high note with a look at the Obama administration and on specific instances, it has went against big business.  My only beef with this movie is its lack of citations of major laws passed with regards to corporate regulation.",1279152000,,781,4.6231884057971016
3968739,4,B002QW7ALW,"""Capitalism"" is interesting, but no longer as thought-provoking as his previous works.  In some sense, ""Capitalism"" shows Michael Moore's allegiance to a country he loves.  Generally, Moore (and his work) is one you will either love or hate... there is no middle ground.  This movie is not his best work, but it is still stirring and somewhat informative.  Some might say it is one-sided, and others will agree.  The examples presented are extreme and engaging, but maybe it is what we need to motivate ourselves to do what we can to get out of the hole we are in right now.  Capitalism works, and it works for the many, but capitalism works well only for the few.  I probably will not recommend this movie as a ""must-see.""  But it can be entertaining if you have an open mind.",1279152000,,777,4.579710144927536
3968740,4,B002QW7ALW,"I liked this movie. I've watched all Michael Moore movies and, by now, I was gettin a little tired with his one-dimension remarks. He was extremely radical in denouncing other radicals, if you knwo what I mean. One side only.

In this one, he's a little bit more moderate, although still going for the jugular. In the end, what I perceive is that capitalism is not an evil; but to let capitalism live without ANY form of regulation by the government is suicide.",1279152000,,461,4.554216867469879
3968741,2,B002QW7ALW,"This is Michael Moore's template for making a documentary: show some unfortunate end results of some kind of system, then dismiss the whole system outright.

What people like Moore don't take into account is human nature. He brings up the example of Jonas Salk, who selflessly worked to create a polio vaccine. Wonderful. If everyone was so unselfish and dedicated, maybe we could be communists.

He also brings up examples of companies who operate more like a co-op. I love the idea. Are there many entrepeneurs who would risk their fortunes to start a company, in which there isn't the promise of gargantuan return? I doubt it. I wish that weren't the case, but it is.

People look out for themselves and their families. Is that good or bad? I don't know. But it's reality. It's the result of eons of evolution.

Why would I take a huge risk to start a business that could fail and potentially cost me tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars? Is it because I'm like Jonas Salk, and will work tirelessly and without thought of myself, because I believe so strongly in my widget? No, it's because having more personal wealth is a good thing. It means I can travel more. I can give my kids a better education. I can retire without worrying about whether I live long enough to outlast my money.

And as a byproduct, others would benefit from my wealth. That's right, economics isn't about one pie that stays the same size, and being wealthy means I take a bigger piece of the pie, leaving others with less. Wealthy people make the pie bigger, so that everyone gets more.

I don't dismiss the examples shown in the movie...they are the unfortunate results of selfishness gone bad. Would those exact stories be replicated in another economic system, like communism? No. But if we were communists, there would be another Michael Moore making documentaries about all the unfortunate hard luck stories created by communism. I'm guessing the stories would be much worse.

If there is an economic system in which a boatload of people don't get the shaft, I'd love to hear it.",1278720000,5,2067,4.693370165745856
3968742,1,B002QW7ALW,"Is the irony that Mr. Moore 'capitalized' on the shortcomings of capitalism to make a for-profit movie lost on anyone?

Featuring the story about PA Child Care as an accurate representation of capitalism is like featuring Michael Vick as an accurate representation of the NFL. It's insulting to people who go about their business in an honest manner.

Mr. Moore focuses solely on the despicable, bottom feeders of our capitalistic system. He bleaches out the good, and fails to include compelling, competing views of our capitalistic system by quoting the likes of the owner of Condo Vultures, an obvious scumbag.

I run a small business, and this is what I tell my liberal, statist friends who worship at Mr. Moore's altar. Were I to try to trick my customers, cut corners, hide profits, and do any sort of shenanigan that Mr. Moore espouses as being universally practiced, I'd be out of business in less than a year. Intangibles like reputation count for a lot, and people do have the choice not to use my services. In fact, I've been able to start a business and provide for myself and my family precisely because we have free market capitalism. Were we living in Cuba, I doubt I'd be allowed, just as Mr. Moore's movie-making career would not have led to obesity and awards were he making films critical of Castro there.

This is not to say there weren't some eye-opening segments in the movie. The practice of major companies cashing in on ""Dead Peasants"" was new to me and is loathsome. However, so is the government's use of Fannie/Freddie to indirectly entice people to buy homes they couldn't afford. Mr. Moore is silent on anything that doesn't fit his narrow world view.

In sum, Mr. Moore is unfortunately part of the contemporary ""American problem,"" (as I like to call it): our media is dominated by the far left and the far right, to the exclusion of the middle. Mr. Moore's failure to even acknowledge that there is a middle ground is all the more ironic given his apparent love of the 'middle' class. With all its faults and flaws, free market capitalism in a democratic society is good, and those of you reading this on a fancy pc drinking Starbucks coffee ought to agree.",1278720000,48,2189,4.704960835509138

His concerns that BIg Finance and corporatism have hijacked our democracy are well founded, (especially considering the Supreme Court's recent ruling allowing corporations with deep pockets to anonymously finance political campaigns without limits) Most Moore fans have probably already seen the flick and those who already hate him will never view it. Pity that, as this is a film for all americans who believe in and love democracy. For most viewers, the extras will be the reason to pick up this DVD.

3968744,2,B002QW7ALW,"I have been a big Michael Moore fan in the past and have seen most of his movies as well as most, if not all, of TV Nation and The Awful Truth. In most all of these efforts it was really refreshing to see Moore as a fearless scrapper trying desperately to speak truth to power; of particular merit was Roger & Me, where Moore presented in blistering clarity the disparity between GM's upper management and its work force. Other notable efforts include Fahrenheit 911 and Sicko (you can kinda take or leave Bowling for Columbine and The Big One.) It's important that we have people willing to do this and I generally applaud his efforts, even in the areas that I do not necessarily agree.

However, the whole point is that it must be TRUTH that is spoken and that is where this effort goes off the rails. I saw Capitalism: A Love Story last night and was really taken aback by how far Mr. Moore went beyond advocacy documentary into outright distortion.

A couple of notes on this:

(i) A huge segment of the film is spent on TARP and what is called repeatedly the ""Bank Bailout"". However, in none of this coverage was it disclosed or mentioned: (a) TARP to financial institutions was a loan, not a gift, which required payment with substantial interest; (b) most major FIs did not want the TARP funds and many took it over objection; (c) TARP recipients were required to post collateral (convertible warrants) against the TARP funds; (d) all major TARP financial institutions (other than AIG and Regions) have, in fact, paid back the TARP funds; and (e) the government made a profit on TARP to FIs.

(ii) Who has the government not recouped TARP funds from? You guessed it - the auto industry (Chrysler, GM, and GMAC). It kind of ruins Mr. Moore's thesis that the pension obligations of all those salt-of-the-earth folks back in Flint were a major contributor to TARP non-repayment.

(iii) Throughout the film, foreclosures are blamed exclusively on banks and FIs; Mr. Moore makes a show of making ""citizen's arrests"" and covering banks in crime scene tape. However, the reality is really a lot more complicated than that banks tricked or otherwise defrauded people out of their homes. There is a little segment regarding how some banks induced homeowners into leveraging equity in their homes, but beyond that not a whole lot of analysis. In reality, home prices actually did rise throughout the 2000's, due in no small part to historically low interest rates. Homeowners acted perfectly rationally in leveraging the excess equity in their homes, as long as home prices continued to rise or even to stabilize at the higher levels. It was the collapse of the real estate bubble that hammered so many homeowners, not fraudulent loans. One could make the argument that banks should have advised more caution than they did, but again that's not what Mr. Moore is arguing. To say that banks defrauded homeowners on a large scale is just incorrect.

(iv) The section on Dead Peasant insurance seemed pretty dishonest to me. The whole idea about companies taking out life insurance on its employees is that a company is materially affected when key employees die and needs to have some kind of risk mitigant against this. An analogy would be if in days past, a business has a key piece of equipment or capital (say a factory); if the company loses that factory unexpectedly, it will need immediate money to get back on track after the loss. Today, human capital (especially at higher levels) is really the key investments of modern corporations. If a company loses a key employee, it will (a) lose all of the resources that it invested in developing the employee; (b) lose all of the specific knowledge, plans, strategies, etc. that person had; and (c) have to find and develop someone new quickly. It is not fraudulent at all to want to plan ahead for this kind of expense and buying insurance on an employee really does not implicate a fraud at all (there is no trickery or detrimental reliance). However, Mr. Moore depicts this practice (quite strongly) as fraud on the employee's family and as attempts by companies to profit off the deaths of their employees.

(v) There is a strong implication that the crash of an airline flight causing 50 deaths (I think it was Comair Flight 191, but am not sure) was a result of financial hardships put on its pilots. This naked assertion is back up only by the fact that the pilot and co-pilot had discussed financial matters earlier in the flight and that the co-pilot had a second job in a restaurant. This was a pretty weak thread to hang the whole argument that pilots are paid too little on.  Even if one agrees with that pilots should be paid more (and I find some merit to the argument), this seems like a pretty weaselly way to frame the question.

(vi) The Black-Shoals Formula is shown on the screen with Mr. Moore explaining that the formula was specifically designed to be too complicated for everyday investors to understand. Absolutely factually inaccurate. BSF was created to model (imperfectly) the pricing of fairly simple concepts (rights to buy and sell as specific prices in the future called put and call options). It was created by academics to approximate the best way to price existing instruments, not to confuse or mislead anyone.

Also, not really an inaccuracy, but.... While complex derivatives are pretty hard to explain, calls and puts are not. Mr. Moore presents these basic ideas like they are so complex not even experts can explain them.

Conclusion
So, at the end of the day, would I recommend this movie? Probably not. If you are already pretty knowledgeable about TARP and the financial crisis, the lapses in fact and analysis will probably be too striking for you to enjoy the film. If not, you will need to go in understanding that you should beware that you will be mislead in some areas and that you should probably consult a counter-point to balance out some of the misperceptions presented.",1278374400,9,5972,4.749276759884282
3968745,3,B002QW7ALW,"Economics. Who in their right mind would try and make a feature length film about that subject? Michael Moore's previous work that included subjects about guns, General Motors, and George W. Bush, to the audience these were clear points for us to identify with, or in most cases, against.

In his new film, Capitalism: A Love Story, Moore attempts demystify what economics and capitalism really mean to the vast majority of Americans. This is no easy feat. I must admit the first quarter of the film had me doubting if he would secede. I am not going to sit by and say that people who took out adjustable rate mortgages and then were foreclosed are not at all to blame. They bear a good share of personal responsibility. But so do the lenders who were drooling to make a profit via the art of deception.

Soon afterwards we are presented with an example of capitalism gone awry. A judge in a US town was locking up juvenile offenders, for ""crimes"" such as throwing meat or criticizing a vice-principal online. The prison was a privately run corporation that was sending financial kickbacks to the very judge who was locking these kids up on absurd charges. Granted this was just one example, but a shocking one that could make you question just what are American values. This is where the film really started to get interesting. Are capitalism and Christianity compatible? What becomes of capitalism when you strip out regulation? Who actually controls the government of The United States of America, the top 1% or the bottom 95%? When the markets crashed last fall and the banks cried uncle, where was the oversight by our elected officials regarding the bailout funds?

These are questions, and some answers, that make Moore's documentary effective and engaging. While he is reflecting upon the past he is also asking us, what are we going to do about it in the future?",1277942400,,1871,4.75076923076923

3968750,4,B002QW7ALW,"The premise of Capitalism is that the economic system we thought was an integral and benign part of the American culture of our youth has mutated into something which that is actually preying on us rather than serving or working with us.  Moore looks at a number of different  brought on by American ""industry"" including the creation of a virtual ghosttown out of Moore's hometown, Flint, Michigan; the exploitation of employee deaths through the use of ""dead peasant"" insurance policies; and finally the near economic collapse brought about the the banksters.  Moore closes the film by asserting that we all must take action if we want to rein in American capitalism so that it once more serves the common good rather than the wealthy oligarchy.

Occasionally, Moore goes a bit over the top with teary-eyed testimony by some of the victims and his ""theater"" of attempting to retrieve the taxpayer's bailout money from the banksters is a bit silly.  However, on the whole it is an interesting and thoughtful piece that makes its argument without being overly strident; I tend to get turned off with the hard-sell that some advocates use to advance their position but this fell below my threshold (YMMV).  If you aren't a die-hard supporter of an unfettered free market then this film may cause you to think a bit about our current economic system; if you are a true-believer in the way things currently work then the film will provide an incredible wealth of material to use in your future fulminations.",1277164800,,1503,4.874509803921568
3968751,5,B002QW7ALW,"First of all, I have to say that whatever you feel about his ideology, Michael Moore knows how to make good documentaries. Every frame offers a perfect conjunction of text and accompanying image. The documentary is as engaging as a good mystery film. This is simply very high-quality film-making.

Most of the things Moore narrates are sadly familiar to all of us: foreclosures, businesses failing, unemployment, economically devastated areas that look worse than anything you can find in many third-world countries, the useless and horribly unfair bailouts, the back room deals by Paulson, Geithner, Bush and Co, Obama getting bought out by the same crowd of vile criminals the second he gets close to presidency. We have seen all this unfold, and it's impossible not to recognize that everything Moore shows is true. Many instances in the movie are touching and sad, while many others are hilarious (For example, Moore says after rereading the US Constitution: ""The Constitution doesn't mention capitalism. But it does talk about 'welfare' and 'union'. Wait, welfare and union? That sound like a very different -ism!"")

Now, after all I have said in praise of Capitalism: A Love Story, I have to say that I disagree with Moore's central premise, which is capitalism is bad and it should be substituted by something better, namely democracy. I'm sure Moore understands extremely well that you can't substitute one with another since democracy is a political system and capitalism is an economic one. He uses the word ""democracy"" in order to avoid saying the word that scares the regular movie-going people, namely ""socialism.""

To support his view that socialism is better, Moore tells a story of a business owned by all its workers together. Every decision is made jointly by the workers in a democratic-style voting process. I'm glad this system works for the company Moore describes in the movie. However, this could never work on a larger scale. If anything, a smooth running of his business is a huge exception. I, for one, do not want to run my place of work. It's not my job and I don't want it to be my job. Some people are good at being managers, organizers, and the leaders of people. Other people are not. Working collectively on a shared project is an impossible burden for some people. There is no doubt in my mind that not having one actual owner will bankrupt an absolute majority of businesses very soon.

The reality that Moore doesn't address is that the current economic system in the US is not really capitalist. In many ways, it is eerily similar to the Soviet economy. In the Soviet Union, huge amounts of government money would go to bail out companies that could not survive on their own. If there were a real capitalism in the US, Goldman Sachs would have gone bankrupt a long time ago. The way capitalism works is that if you are inept enough to bankrupt your company, you are pushed off the market by more capable competitors. Goldman Sachs has long been completely incapable of an honest win over anybody else. They are kept in place by a complex system of Soviet-style handouts. This is as contrary to capitalism as anything can possibly be.

In spite of disagreeing with Moore's ideas, I'm giving the movie five stars simply because nobody makes documentaries of such a high quality as he does.",1276992000,4,3325,4.846830985915493
3968752,4,B002QW7ALW,"In his film _Tough Guise:  Violence, Media, and the Crisis in Masculinity_, Jackson Katz, anti-violence educator and activist, says at one point that when you ""kill the messenger, you don't need to face squarely the implications of the message.""  I open with this quote since it reminds me so much of the reaction to Michael Moore's films:  so often reviews of his films open with an ad hominem attack on Moore himself.  (I've frequently seen this happen first-hand; I've taught _Bowling for Columbine_ in my college classes so that we can talk about issues of school violence, and my students want to attack Moore before they have even watched the film.) He is one of those filmmakers who polarizes his viewers, and his detractors want to shoot him down, without giving his ideas a fair listen.

If you're open to Moore's messages, his newest film is worth a listen.  This documentary is about our capitalist society, but it's also an expose about the criminal activity that our corporations have engaged in, and towards which our government has turned a blind eye.  Most compelling, though, are the accounts and interviews of the average families who have been so affected by the last few years of recession.  Seeing these families lose their homes is hard to watch, and the connections that Moore makes between the Wall Street fat cats and the very real consequences that their actions have had on the average American family is distressing.

If you're open to the message, this film is worth seeing.",1276732800,2,1503,4.862745098039215

If we could only get people like Mr. Moore elected to serve in Washington then maybe, just maybe, we (and the nation) would stand a chance of surviving the current turmoil intact. Everyone alive in the U.S.A. today should watch this (agree with the politics or not) and see just how the corporate powers-that-be are really running our country.

3968768,5,B002QW7ALW,"I'll say at the outset that I'm a fan of Mr. Moore's work and that my views tend to coincide with his.  But, even if you're a libertarian-leaning conservative, I suspect that you'll tend to agree with Moore's analysis and you'll not find Mr. Moore's presentation too partisan to listen to.  This documentary tends toward Mr. Moore's less sarcastic side: like ""Sicko,"" it's very focused, very thoughtful (conservative Fox News critics praised ""Sicko"").  If you had never seen Moore's work before, you might think that a more traditional libertarian-conservative had done ""Capitalism, A Love Story.""  I rate it five stars.  There's some of Michael Moore's characteristic humor, but, on the whole, it's very matter of fact.

I don't think this film caught on with the public as it should have: local theaters censored it (it was not played in my locale at all, even though this metro area contains about 150,000 people).  Local theater managers blocked Bill Maher's excellent ""Religulous"" film, also.  I guess that the secret of conservative success in America is just to block out competing ideas.  I hope this review doesn't get censored, too (sometimes, Amazon won't post them).",1275177600,3,1178,5.09375
3968769,2,B002QW7ALW,"CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY

STARRING: Michael Moron... I mean Moore

WRITTEN BY: Michael Moore

DIRECTED BY: Michael Moore

Rated: R
Genre: Documentary
Release Date: 02 October 2009

There is perhaps nothing that helps sustain the value of your own personal opinion more, than hearing an opposing one; or better yet an ignorant opposing one. This was exactly the case for me, after watching my first Michael Moore film ever; Capitalism: A Love Story.

I very much love the saying `keep your friends close and your enemies closer.' I'm not saying Moore is my enemy, but as we have vastly different views from one another, I will from here-out see all of his films. I enjoy learning and understanding the opposing side's opinion in any conflict every bit as much as I do hearing others that share the same beliefs as me.

I thought this film was decent as a documentary, but that does not mean that I agreed with Moore's ridiculous message. He's a brilliant filmmaker, and he goes to great lengths to get his point across and puts a lot of time and effort into his project. I respect that. There are far too many people that complain about an issue to the point of mental and physical exhaustion, and yet do nothing about it. At least Moore is making movies with hopes of evoking a change. Even if you don't agree with him, you can still appreciate his passion to be heard and at times his intentions seem to come from a good place.

Michael Moore is a funny and somewhat intelligent guy. I particularly liked the joke he made in reference to the receding hair line of a rich executive. His film was well narrated with interesting and innovative dialogue voiced by Moore himself. It was also filled with probably the most impressive collection of archive footage I have ever seen. It was not a cheap film to make in the least bit. Which the thought of, led me to some pretty interesting discoveries about him on google.

I don't like that Moore wants to change America, but I do like that the reason (he claims) for wanting to, is for the benefit of others; not himself. Personal benefit is Moore's biggest objection to capitalism and I can see why. Where his film fails to sell his objection to me, are in two huge conflicts with the film itself. The first of which being what I mentioned in the previous paragraph, in regards to my google discoveries; they completely contradict his self righteous claims. Moore is a huge capitalist himself!

According to google, he lives in a million-dollar apartment in New York and keeps another million-dollar beachfront house in Michigan for vacations. Oh, and he sends his child to a private school! Here are a couple fun quotes from Moore, ""I'm a millionaire, I'm a multi-millionaire. I'm filthy rich. You know why I'm a multi-millionaire? `Cause multi-millions like what I do. That's pretty good, isn't it?"" And there is also, ""I'm a hypocrite. I admit it. I'm not 100% consistent."" - all on google.

The second gaping flaw in Moore's philosophy of capitalism is found in his interpretation of the word. Along with several others interviewed by Moore in the documentary, he believes that capitalism is evil, wrong and should be eliminated from our country's lifestyle.

At one point, a man being interviewed actually believed and tried to convince us that capitalism is unjust in an ice cream scenario. He basically said that if one man is selling ice cream, and a man in competition with him is also selling ice cream, and if that second man's ice cream happens to be better that the first guy's - then the first guy will go out of business. Well no kidding! What are we supposed to buy a bad product from someone just to keep them in business? Give me a break! Where is the logic in this thinking?

Capitalism is not evil or wrong. Much like many other things in life, its taken advantage of by evil and or selfish people. Saying that capitalism is evil and wrong, is no different than saying the same thing about our traffic laws. People speed and run red lights in this country everyday, causing death and serious bodily harm to others. Does this mean we need to eliminate traffic laws because certain individuals choose to disobey them? Of course not. Or you can take it a step further and say that Catholicism is evil and wrong because priests have taken advantage of the sacred trust the religion has granted them, by molesting children who confide in them. Just because there are individuals who screw it up for everyone else, does not mean that it's the system that's flawed.

Despite what Moore believes or depicts in his film, capitalism is one of the things our great nation was founded on, and is one of many freedoms that make it the best country on the planet. Let's take a trip back to high school for a moment, and I'll refresh you with the word's definition according to [...]: Capitalism - an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.

Should the rich give to the poor? Yes. But should they be forced to? No; that would be socialism. Is our country perfect? No; but what country is? And we are still the best. I've said it more than once already, but I'll say it again - we are the best! Would it be nice if everyone had healthcare across the nation? Absolutely. But where are all of these trillions of dollars going to come from? And should we force Americans to have healthcare when the vast majority are against this plan? Should we threaten them with jail time if they fail to adhere to the government policy regarding healthcare? No; this is called communism. The government has more than enough control, as it is.

One topic Moore takes the time to point out in the film is that airline pilots make less than $20,000 a year. Um, I thought this sounded absurd, and it is absurd. Go ahead and google what pilots make. While some may start out at a low wage, the majority are sittin' pretty to say the least. Moore is a liar. None of the things he depicts in this film are backed up by any substantial evidence other than his word, and sarcastic voice-over. He's a child with a giant microphone, and a lot of idiots are holding onto his every word as if it were the word of Christ and its scary.

At one point, Moore actually tires to justify a pilot killing a plane full of people in an accidental crash-landing, because he was stressed out due to his low wage, thus being unable to focus. What? So are people working at fast food chains supposed to be let off the hook if they kill hundreds of people via food poisoning due to their pitiful hourly wages? No! No one is forcing them, or the pilots for that matter, into this line of work. This is America; the land of opportunity for God's sake! Come on Moore!

Rather than focus on the facts, Moore is pre-determined with shoving propaganda down our throats. The root-word of documentary is document right? Thought so. Watch how he refers to Germany and Japan in reference to World War II. Where was he going with this?  Did he forget Pearl Harbor? The Holocaust? Much like ignorant people who live in a country, but fly the flag of another country and parade it around downtown, slamming the country they currently reside in; Moore is equally offensively moronic. If these other countries are so great - why don't these people live there? Hello?

However, as upsetting as these people make proud Americans, in a strange way it's a beautiful compliment to our nation; because it is more than fair that Moore and his league of morons can deface her. It's their God given right to express their opinions, as is it for Moore to make this film.

This is America after all, and we are the good guys. In one of several other countries that he has yet to move to after bashing his own, Moore would have been slaughtered for what he's done here. Isn't America great Moore?",1275004800,6,7991,4.5897615708274895
3968770,4,B002QW7ALW,"I appreciated the extras on this DVD - there was nearly another film's worth of material with all the extra interviews with people that appeared relatively briefly in the main film. Keep in mind, the interviews are about as slanted as the main film content, but it's still nice to be able to hear people talk at length on their subject of interest instead of being limited to 30 seconds here or there.

I approached this film with an open mind. The further I went into this film, the more disinterested I got because it was just one accusation formed on opinion after another without any solid evidence presented to prove the previous accusation (your employer wants you to die). At the end, I felt the movie had made you muddle through all those theories and left you floating midair in the middle of nowhere without any valid facts to anchor you down. Not exactly my cup of tea, but entertaining in its own way to see people's viewpoints, agendas, etc.

Basically the film is to capitalize on the anger people feel towards the bank bailouts of 2009 and presents you with reasons various corporations blow. I wouldn't really blame capitalism itself, however, on all that is wrong with the system. Capitalism can be what the people make of it, but a few (well, more than a few) corrupt individuals does not capitalism make.

This is a good film to give you somewhere to focus your anger at corporations, but I recommend you take it all in with a grain of salt.",1274659200,,1460,4.564885496183206

3968794,5,B002QW7ALW,"Based on what people think they know about him Michael Moore begets strong reactions.  ""Conservatives"" berate and detest him.  ""Progressives"" love him.  Wherever you are on that spectrum, if you care enough to view this film in the first place don't overlook the extras!  The film itself is somewhat less overwrought than Moore's usual fare.  It is still pungent but rather less adolescently shrill.  But the extras, a series of interviews and vignettes, provide food for thought.  You need perhaps to view them in a second sitting since they run about as long as the film itself.  But viewed in conjunction with the film they do validly raise a number of elemental questions.  Is ""capitalism"" fundamentally good or evil?  Are there better ways (Moore seems big on cooperatives)?  Are we in for a civilizational clash between ""capitalist"" special-interest dollars buying pioliticans' votes, versus ""democracy's"" populist one-person-one-vote?  The film and the extras have their point of view but taken together fairly put it to the viewer really to think about and consider things judiciously.  In that sense, unlike Moore's more polemical earlier works this film (with its extras) does provide food for thought.",1274400000,,1212,5.25
3968795,1,B002QW7ALW,"When ""Roger and Me"" was released two decades ago, I thought it was one of the best documentaries I had seen in years.  Sure, there were points where Michale Moore overplayed things a bit, but the way much of big industry treated American workers was in need of some overplay.  At that point, although I did not exactly agree with his politics, I thought Moore was a promising film maker who would contribute much to the political discussion.

While Moore's bottom line (and waistline) has grown considerably, the merits of his work have been on a sharp decline.  Where once he was challenging, now he is a mere caricature of his former self.  At this point, he is appealing to the political left and attacking the political right and his concern for the ""little guy"" - a big part of his early work - is more how their pain may be used for policial capital than their problems.

""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is little more than ""CAPITALISM BOO!! SOCIALISM HOORAY!!""  Instances of the one-sided treatment and manipulation of the suffering of others abounds and one would think the lessons of the last few decades never happened.  Wall Street certainly is guilty of a lot in the past few years but let us not forget that government was their partner in this mess.  So how does giving all the chips in the game to the other culprit solve things?

Moore never really deals with that issue because he can't.  He somehow wishes to give the country back to the people but confuses ""the people"" with ""the state.""  They are not the same and never have been.  In the meantime, Moore will continue to make dreck like this because it is what Hollywood wants him to make.  But isn't Hollywood big business?  Moore is just another hypocrite who wants us to ""do as I say - not as I do.""",1274227200,35,1768,4.515723270440252
3968796,5,B002QW7ALW,This is definitely Michael Moore's best video to date.  It is intriguing and completely professional.  Even the shorts at the end are worth viewing.,1273622400,2,148,5.125
3968797,3,B002QW7ALW,"This film is entertaining and engaging but is far too slanted to the left and has too much content that is separated from reality for me to want to call it a documentary. There are a lot of comments from laid-off auto workers who are upset that they aren't getting the deal they expected from the auto companies. Welcome to life my friends. Things have changed over the last 50 years.

After spending some time watching people being upset with not getting their house paid for or their retirement reinstated, the film just got to be too irritating for me and I turned it off. I'm a registered Democrat and I support much of the left wing agenda. This though has nothing to do with a liberal viewpoint as it does with what I can only imagine is Michael Moore's still bruised ego over having lost his job years ago.",1273536000,6,813,4.42
3968798,2,B002QW7ALW,"I put off watching this DVD until last weekend because I wanted to wait for it to come out on DVD.

As far as documentary making goes this film it is an incoherent mess.  To be fair, Moore has never been a top drawer documentary film maker -he never claimed to be one.  I cut him a lot of slack most of the time because some of his stuff is entertaining, but this one is especially sloppy.  I think his hate for the America we now have resulted in some poor decision making.  While I agree with his dislike of the America we have become, my discomfort comes from a very different place.  Most annoying is the silly charge upon GM head quarters and the cartoonish antics like the crime tape stuff.  Enough already.

Ultimately Moore's unsupported thesis is that socialism provides a more democratic and fair economic system and that the European model of a government controlled economic, medical, and social security system should be adopted in the US.

Oddly enough, as if to present balance, he has his actor friend Wallace Shawn at the beginning the film describe why a classic economic reading of free market capitalism is superior (not a panacea mind you) to socialism.  In short, a free capitalist market is the most efficient and democratic way to determine demand for goods and services --not a government bureaucracy which leads to waste, corruption, inequity, and in many cases throughout history, genocide.  I appreciated that concise few minutes of the film even if it was only offered as a nod to fair documentary journalism.  Unfortunately Moore never returns to the theory and its clear validation through the American experience.

All Moore proceeds to do for the next ninety minutes is claim capitalism is evil by illustrating the seemingly endless collusion of corrupt government officials and corporate CEOs.  The basic tenant of Moore's argument (and all pro-socialists) is that free market capitalism is a zero sum game i.e. for every winner there is a loser.  That is simply not true and a great myth perpetrated by all socialists in an effort to support their beliefs.  All of Moore's ""zero sum"" examples illustrated problems associated with big government, political corruption, and theft among the elite.  He offered ZERO proof that capitalism or free markets are the problem.  It becomes painfully clear very early on in the film that Michael Moore (as many reviews on this thread also demonstrate just reading their reviews) has no idea what free market capitalism IS!

In a cloud of ignorance so thick you can smell the stink, Michael Moore spends most of the film telling us all what we already know: that big government programs like the trillion dollar TARP bailout of big corporations was evil...Gee Michael, NO KIDDING!!  But the corrupt tentacles that connect the US Treasury to Goldman Sachs and all over Congress have nothing to do with capitalism or free markets.  It is called cronyism and corruption -things birthed naturally from big government!

In the end, Michael Moore fails to produce one single piece of evidence to prove that free market capitalism is the evil he wants it to be.  If Moore had refocused his effort on the real evil (big government) and re-titled his documentary then he would have been taken more seriously.  Unfortunately all Moore can do in the end is prop up a dusty old socialist democrat Bernie Sanders and extol him as the man with the answers to all of our problems.  Moore goes further down the rabbit hole and laments the death of high paying union jobs and benefits.  He then puts the cherry on top of the socialist soda with the ""hero of the stupid,"" FDR, as his proof that democratic socialism works.  Are you kidding me?  FDR and LBJ created the welfare state.  Social Security and Medicare are massive Ponzi failures for everyone except a few early recipients who paid little and are getting great returns.  Future generations will get NOTHING.  We are now paying severely for these and other welfare policies by way of misinterpretation of Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution, AKA the General welfare clause.  BTW, just for the record, every modern Republican president has failed to address these issues as well -proving that all politicians are just one party united by corruption driven to steal from you and me in an effort to eliminate rights and liberties and enrich themselves.

Like any high school dropout filmmaker, Moore lacks the critical thinking skills necessary to put together a truly interesting documentary.  He offers only false cause and effect fallacies and one side of the low hanging fruit known as emotional arguments.  He provides absolutely no analysis of the killing machine he so wants to emulate --the massive unemployment and unsustainable debt in socialist Europe, the inhumane living conditions, practices, and policies of communist Cuba and Venezuela, and of course the natural extension of Soviet and Chinese communism that produced mass genocide.  At one point Moore limply holds up Japan as an example of a well oiled government/private symbiosis.  Oooppps, wrong again Michael.  Japan has been in a massive recession since the late nineties and their government pension system is failing faster than ours.

Sorry Michael, free market capitalism may have a few problems and may need a little tweaking here and there, but it is by far the most advancing, egalitarian, and humane economic system ever tried.  Lastly, let's just look at the facts: the countries with the freest markets are the most advanced.  Countries with the least free markets are third world countries.

Bottom line: Michael Moore has failed to make a documentary that any thinking person can take seriously.  Moore offers no new model or new ideas, just a retread of old silly socialist myths.  This film is an obtuse mosaic that fails to make any real point other than government corruption is everywhere.  For that you need only to read the newspaper every day.  Two stars only for the kernel of truth Moore stumbled upon but didn't develop.  Skip this one.",1273449600,10,6073,4.9204322200392925
3968799,4,B002QW7ALW,"It was the abuses of 19th Century-style Capitalism - excessively long hours at low pay, violent strike-breaking, child-labor and the like - that helped give Communism its initial appeal.  As a cure, however, Communism was worse than the disease, yet some of the worst capitalistic ills were still removed.  The corruption that often comes with big wealth has never gone away, but, as Michael Moore contends in his documentary, Capitalism:  A Love Story, it is more ruinous now than ever.

The problems (as Moore presents them) are linked to the excessive ties between business and government, particularly (but not solely) under Reagan and Bush, Jr.  This resulted in a number of financial disasters, most significantly in 2008 when economic collapse seemed imminent.  But was there really the danger of collapse, or was it just another scheme by Goldman, Sachs, et al?

For those familiar with Moore's narrative style, this movie will fit right in with other works such as Sicko and Farenheit 911.  Much as Moore is good at illustrating his points (often with humor), he has his flaws too.  For one thing, he meanders a lot and some of his most compelling issues - like companies taking life insurance policies out on employees and children being sent to institutions by a judge more interested in kickbacks than justice - are not followed through on very thoroughly.  Moore also tends to hold ""the people"" completely innocent (if a bit naive), ignoring the fact that many of them were spending money they shouldn't have.

The movie presents Obama as the President who may turn things around, a promise that seems still up in the air right now.  Of course, Obama would have just been starting his presidency when this film was completed.  It's often a very slapdash movie, but Capitalism:  A Love Story also will make you angry at a system that offers a lot but often delivers only a little.",1273449600,,1892,4.871875
3968800,4,B002QW7ALW,"I will be the first to admit that I do not like a lot of Michael Moore's politics and disagree with him on a number of things.  Having said that, I would strongly recommend that people watch Capitalism: A Love Story.  This film is ideally suited for times such as these. For once, Moore abandons the smug self-righteous persona that makes it so hard to enjoy or be informed by his other films. For the first time since Roger and Me he seems genuinely concerned for the lives of those around him.

His most telling argument is when he shows major banks foreclosing on small families and offering the argument that in America, we have capitalism and that is the best system ever.

And he has conned millions into paying money to watch it. Then he claims he is not a Capitalist. Can you spell hypocrite?

Mr. Moore's solution to all of our problems seems to be some kind of populist democracy. Not sure where the financial system fits into his imaginary world? He is not very clear on that point. But, we will all have good jobs, lots of money and a great life when his new world appears. I can hardly wait. Maybe we can use Cuba or

This film captures the pathos of our economic crisis and fearlessly questions the assumption that capitalism is what made America great. As a former economist, I already knew the lyrics to this song, but Moore played the tune that revealed the story's heart and soul, in the lives of the people who are living it. Of course there is exaggeration, there is dramatic posturing - this is a movie, isn't it? We use drama and various forms of verbal and visual rhetoric to tell a story, to inject it straight into our hearts and minds, if possible, and this film succeeds. From Flint, Michigan, the place of Mr. Moore's roots, to the rooftops of a drowned New Orleans, to the skyscrapers of Wall Street, we all bear witness to the history of rapacious greed and of deep despair. Then he takes us past the despair into hope and activism. At the end, he tells us, ""Do something!""

While Moore has had a sharper focus in his other films -- gun control, the Bush administration, the plight of laid-off autoworkers -- this film looks at the big picture.

Let's be frank. If you're right of center, you're not going to like this movie. Moore is left wing all the way, and that's fine with me. He stacks the deck in his films (and this one is no exception), but not unfairly. You're seeing the unadulterated truth about capitalism here, and it sure isn't pretty. There are winners and there are losers -- lots of them -- and this film consists primarily of their stories. I have to confess that it makes me feel guilty to own holdings in some of the companies that are rightfully chastised here, and I did make some changes in my portfolio as a result. So I guess Moore is having some effect, with me anyway.

3968833,5,B002QW7ALW,"There are so mny reviews of this movie it makes no sense to add to them.  But I was so moved by this the urge to add my thoughts was undeniable.

When I first became interested in America and its history I thought very little of the country.  Then my attitude changed and I became a flag waver.  No I would like to wave the flag, but my view is clouded by what I've seen wrong with the country and the ignorance, stupidity and hyporacy of the elected officials and the voters who put them where they can do the most harm.  My fear is we will get the result we vote for.  Why should I care?  My time on this earth is growing very short, but there are people who are important to me and I don't want them to suffer because of the idiots who seem to have all the energy and wealth needed to rule our government.

I believe in the inevitability of revolution.  No group of people will support a government which neglects their human needs forever.  What I fear is who will lead and begin this revolution.  It looks very much like it will be the extreme right wing who demand the return to the good days of the past when America was great and the dhining city on the hill offering a beacon to the rest of the world.  Sounds great if you know nothing of the ""good old days of moral values and the benefits of capitalism.""  Does communism work? No. For the same reason that Christianity does not work.  It is against human nature.  No one is willing to support the common good if it will cost him.  This is the same reason capitalism doesn't work.  It is a religion that recognizes and uses the basic flaws in human nature that keep us from being as human as we shouid be.  A newspaper columnist once said, ""The trouble with the beautiful people is they are neither.""  This is the problem with the cpoitalist:  he is neither beautiful nor human.

I normally don't look at tthis type of show because it depresses me to realize there are many problems that I can do nothing about.  There are many error of judgement that I cannot ecducate about.  When the radical right ""leaders"" advocate secession I say ""let them go.""  Then I remember another movie where a two bit dictator declares war on the U. S. so he can get foreign aid from us.

3968838,1,B002QW7ALW,"I have seen other Michael Moore films that subvert the truth to support his opinion.  He is a most dishonest man making very dishonest movies.  In this movie, capitalism is a name of a system that causes unfair things to happen to people.  These unfair things are not a result of capitalism but rather because life in general is not fair.  Capitalism is a method of allocating resources based upon their best economic value and return.  Another way of saying this is that capitalism places money where it is most efficiently and beneficially used.  It is not perfect because nature is not perfect, nor is man.  Capitalism and its market based system of resource allocation is indifferent to whether an individual is wealthy or poor.  It is economically blind as it relates to you or me.  However, capitalism, as a free market system, does need to be regulated to assure that it is generally performing reasonably well as a system.  Our capitalist system requires continued monitoring to assure its viability.  Without regulation it does not work in everyone's best interest and with over-regulation, the same unfavorable result can occur.

All societies require laws to protect one person from another.  Such laws are generally very clear when they deal with physical harms caused by a person to another.  But our laws are not clear when dealing with economic equality because they cannot alter the charater or talents of an individual when compared to another.  Some people are going to be richer and some poorer.  There is no way to guarantee equality, nor should there be, unless we will be satisfied with no competition, no growth, no new ideas, no technolgical advancement or no improvements in medical care, among many other advancements that are caused by people who are smarter or work harder than others.  Our tax laws compensate substantially for economic differences among people and their ability or willingness to improve our overall well being, but there can never be an assurance of economic equality so long as one person is smarter or works harder than another.  Our tax laws actually limit the proclivity of such virtues.  It seems that Michael Moore would like to criminalize differences among people.  How can you say to a young person that he or she better not be too smart or work too hard becaused it may result in another person having less, or feeling inferior to you.  Mr. Moore's films are very critical but never suggest answers to what he says are problems.  If you are critical but have no alternatives to offer, then you are part of the problem.

What Michael Moore is suggesting is that our system is bad because it does not confer the same level of economic security to all people.  I do not know how much Mr. Moore makes from his films taking advantage of our inequality, but I suspect his message of inequality does not apply to him.  Mr. Moore makes his money by making others disatisfied with their lives and gives them an excuse to be disatisfied.  For this, I believe his film making does a tremendous disservice to our society.  If I had to choose a word to describe him, it would be ""liar"" for not telling the whole truth.  His films are lies for the same reason.",1271808000,30,3204,4.755434782608695

options, actually own part of it.  A democratic (small d) company.

To an extent he gets in the way in this movie, which starts off well and has an incredibly powerful message. We see families being made homeless because of a combination of their greed and naivete abetted by lenders who went out of their way to cover-up possible fees and problems with the loans. We also see Wall Street people at a loss to explain credit default swaps, and see government people talking about how horribly run the bailouts were (which, to be fair, do seem to have largely prevented the economy from totally dying). We also see a worker's uprising at Republic Windows and Doors (and, oddly, don't see anything of Blagojevich's appearance at said uprising), and generally we get a message that, ""these rich people will screw you and will keep screwing you until you force them to stop.""

This is a good, valid and powerful message, as well as being 100% accurate. They have the money, but we have the vote and can put a stop to this nonsense any time we choose. We just have to choose to do so.

We also hear about other countries, most notably Germany and Japan, where the workers and government control a great deal of what business does. These are countries that have routinely beat us in the marketplace and do so while having a great many more restrictions on them than companies here do.

But where the movie fails is towards the end, when Moore feels the need to do one of the cute little stunts his movies are so famous for. In ""Sicko"" he took 9/11 rescue workers to get medical care in Cuba. In this movie he goes to Wall Street and plays ""innocent schlub number 114"", as he tries to get money back from the investment banks and puts crime scene tape all over the place.

This adds an extra fifteen minutes or so to the movie and really doesn't serve much of a purpose. It also gets in the way of the central message of the film.

Moore is right that unfettered capitalism is a horribly evil system, and one that we're totally in love with as a concept. We go out of our way to remove regulations as much as possible and then act surprised when bad things happen. Capitalism is a great, wonderful system when it's very, VERY heavily regulated. With that regulation you get the economies of places like Germany and Japan. Without it, you get what we've had for the last couple years.

And sadly, I learned about ""dead peasant"" insurance policies taken out by corporations (like Wal Mart) on their lower echelon employees.  It looks like the company was hoping that the employees died as insurance payoffs would go to the company, not the families of the deceased.  How gruesome.

3968858,5,B002QW7ALW,"It can be difficult even reviewing a Michael Moore film, because people tend to have a strong reaction to the man's very name, let alone his work. Objectivity can be difficult, because Moore is not exactly subtle with his political and social stances, or really with much of anything else. In that regard Capitalism is much like his other works, in that he employs a mixture of historical footage, personal interviews, grandstanding publicity stunts and loaded voice-overs to make his points. I suspect much of how one responds to Moore's work greatly depends upon how close one's politics are to the filmmaker's. Fortunately for me, mine line up almost a hundred per cent.

Moore's target this time is to attempt to answer the question, ""what the hell went wrong with America?"" And the answer is, to distill a two-hour movie down to a single word, greed. He traces the unleashing of the greed culture (spurred on by guess which president, and no, it's not Nixon?) through its development in the last three decades, all culminating with the damage it's doing the country now. As with all Moore pieces, he also shows some small pockets of brave citizens doing their part to resist the tide of corporate greed and inhumanity, and like his other works his most effective scenes are where he interviews the victims (a family who is paid a thousand dollars to clean out their own foreclosed home make especially troublesome watching).

There's little I can add in the way of an actual review - most people are aware of how Michael Moore makes films and what his agenda is, save that here (like in his book Dude, Where's My Country?) he's trying to wake people up into action. How successful that will be, I don't know; we are after all largely a nation of dead-eyed suburbanites who, to quote 1776, would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor. And no doubt there are (predominantly) conservatives who are pooh-poohing this film and waving their Tea Party signs while they scream about encroaching socialism; but if your brain isn't completely closed to logic and reason and you wondered why America's in such a dismal state, well, this movie will explain it to you simply and clearly. Rarely have I seen such a direct distillation of what is wrong with this nation so straightforwardly expressed; if I had any say, I'd make this film required viewing. That might expose some people to ideas that don't conform to their belief system, I guess, but if even one person has his mind opened by watching this film, then Moore has done his job.

The questions it brings up are not new, or shocking to anyone, honestly. For the most part, it doesn't provoke as much thought/controversy as his typical movies. Most regular Americans feel that the bailout with our tax dollars was a scam, and how the companies to be helped were hand picked by the government/multinationals themselves. So regardless of your political leaning (unless you are a very well to do person whose friends or family haven't been faced with all the challenges of this collapse) you will find yourself nodding throughout the film - again, for the most part - . He poses what I believe is a good question for a Christian nation, when talking about Jesus and Capitalism.

Obviously Moore takes it a step further and brings out the demise of capitalism, comparing the collapse to the fall of other empires, and things of that nature. And in his typical fashion goes and puts on a show about doing citizens arrests on the corporations and what not (I don't find this particularly entertaining, nor am I sure why he does this at all)

The best parts in my opinion were pointing out the strong connections between corporate business leaders and presidential advisors, especially in the Reagan and Clinton administrations, and also their ties to congressional leadership.  Most everything about this movie has already been said in these reviews.  My criticisms are these:

1) There is not suggestion on what might be a better system.  Europe and Japan are mentioned but not investigated.  There is only condemnation of what America has done in the past 30 years.  What's the solution?

2) There is a huge cognitive disconnect regarding Barack Obama.  Only positive things are said about him and his election is portrayed as some kind of people's revolution.  I understand Moore does not like the Reagan or Bush people.  That's understandable. But Moore pretty much savaged some Clinton advisors like Robert Rubin and Larry Summers and their complicity in the financial meltdown.  OK, Summers in an economic advisor in the Obama administration and Geithner is advised by Rubin.  It seems to me the good ol' boy system is intact under Obama.  If you're going to point out how Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Tim Geithner, Larry Summers, et al all work to enrich the banks, then how can Obama be a manifestation of change? He has basically continued the Clinton economic policies.",1271030400,3,1456,5.03347280334728

3968867,5,B002QW7ALW,"This is Moore's best, I think. In his signature way, he documents the general principles, the relevant policies, the major players, etc. But he makes the general phenomena come alive by showing their effect on specific families and individuals. What's especially good this time is that he doesn't concentrate only on the negative. He also shows both major figures and ordinary individuals who are fighting for what's right and just, sometimes with notable success.

Some of the most memorable ""factoids"" that stay with you are the ironies: like the sign-making shop that stays in business mostly by making foreclosure signs; the fact that 60% of the foreclosure notices are processed through Moore's hometown and major disaster area Flint, MI; that a foreclosing bank hires a family to destroy their own furniture and household goods before leaving.

The outrages Moore reveals are intended to galvanize liberals to resist the greed and cruelty of American-style capitalism. But they are the very same outrages that provide the energy one sees among Tea-Baggers. Perhaps the greatest irony of all: among the Tea-Baggers that energy has been co-opted by capitalists like Dick Armey, Fox News, commodity traders, and even CNN now. In other words, the Tea-Baggers' energy is being used to support the very persons and policies that created the crisis in the first place.

What it comes down to is that liberals will love this movie (unless they just don't like Moore's periodic confrontations), and perhaps they'll be moved to act. As it stands, however, conservatives will hate the movie. Nevertheless, if the very same material were re-edited and disociated from Moore, Tea-Bagger conservatives would love it as much as liberals do now.",1270857600,2,1735,5.211469534050179

Buying or renting the DVD is actually preferable to seeing the film in a theater (although I imagine there would be some pleasure joining in a lusty chorus of BOO's when Cheney's evil, sneering puss appears on the big screen).  That's because the disc includes a number of additional features that ponder the effects of capitalism on our ecology -- and show a few enlightened companies where workers actually share equally in the profits and decisions.

I have to say, I wonder what sort of world we're leaving our children -- and I don't even want to think about the grim fate awaiting our grandchildren.

Unless of course your children wind up among the fortunate few in the top one percent -- and then they'll probably be living behind locked, electrified gates in heavily fortified McMansions far from the poor and middle classes from whom they have profited.

3968916,2,B002QW7ALW,"""Irony"" is too tame a word to describe the experience of hearing a really rich filmmaker narrating in soft, soothing tones as he describes why the ""rich"" are bad.  Making a lot of money by getting childish leftists to hate their own culture seems to be what Moore does best, and here he almost becomes a parody of himself, if anyone is paying attention.

But for those who weren't paying attention, here are some observations.

First, Moore never really defines ""capitalism"" in this movie.  He just teaches why it is bad.  Why didn't he define it first?  I'm guessing that he is counting on the childish leftists to bring their own definition to the film.  They know capitalism is bad, and they just need to know why.

So, what better way then to narrate them through a number of stories of ""bad thing"" happening, with little context or back story or history, and in each case purr in the chidrens' ears about how bad the big mean capitalist is.  Ooooh look children, these people got hurt.  Ooooh look children, there's the capitalist.  He's bad, isn't he children.

Anyway, without wasting too much time on this example of transparently obvious propaganda, here are a few counterpoints.

First, Moore did enlighten me to some bad stuff I didn't know about.  The corporations taking out life insurance policies on their employees being the worst to me, but I hardly think that this is motivated by ""capitalism"" but rather by greed and laws that allow it to happen.  The laws need to be changed, that's all.

Second, Nobody is forcing pilots to fly passenger planes for $20,000 a year (or whatever).  Anyone bright enough to fly an airplane can get a job doing something else for more money.  So, they need to quit and go do something else.

Third, Jesus said things that sound ""capitalist"" too, such as when He said that to him who has, more shall be given, and to he that has not, even what he thinks he has shall be taken from him.  Ooooh children, Jesus sounds ""capitalist"" there.  That wasn't in the movie!  Shocked I am!

Cherry picking Jesus' words to make Him sound like He's on your side is as old as it is wrong, but it never ends.  There is no special place in Hell for ""the rich"".  Paul commanded the rich to be generous, not to become poor.  I do wonder if there might be a special place for those who twist Jesus' words for financial gain.  Hmmmmm.

Fourth, do you know why the AIG bigwigs weren't on the tops of their roofs screaming for help after Hurricane Katrina?  Do you?  Well, like myself, and I'm guessing you, they didn't buy houses below sea level next to an ocean where it was known for many years that the area could not withstand a major hurricane. But the hurricane happened!  Just another reason to hate the capitalist!  Anyone thinking out there?

Anyway, I could go on but I've wasted enough time already.  Time to leave my private property and drive to the privately owned company I work for.  Woe is me.",1270166400,6,2937,4.540076335877862
3968917,4,B002QW7ALW,"The picture Michael Moore paints with this movie will already be quite familiar to anyone who's really been paying attention to what's been happening in the US and looking at the evidence objectively.

As Moore notes, our current US version of capitalism has become severely compromised because people in certain domains (finance, health care, defense, media, very large corporations, etc.) have been able to implement schemes which rob the public wealth, and they've used their resulting concentrated wealth to powerfully manipulate our government in ways that enable perputation or expansion of those schemes.

If the public was able to regain control of the government, these schemes could be shut down and our society could become much more equitable and even prosperous, but the question is how to break the hegemony.  Moore urges rebellion by the masses, but I have to admit that I'm not too optimistic about the prospects for that happening or being effective, though I don't really have any better ideas to offer myself.

Where Moore somewhat errs is that he oversimplifies things.  The problem isn't the broad and diverse category of socioeconomic systems called ""capitalism"" but rather the particular corrupted version of capitalism which we currently have.  And indeed, Adam Smith himself was well aware of the dangers of corruption and pointed them out clearly in his writings.

A related problem is the format of the movie.  Moore does succeed in putting a human face on economic suffering, and thereby elicits emotions which can stir us to action.  But he also paints with a broad brush which leaves out important details and reveals bias.  As a result, while this movie can effectively preach to the choir, I'm not sure that it will be convincing to people who are new to Moore's viewpoint (or opposed to it), so that may ironically undermine Moore's aim of stirring action on a mass scale.

But in the end, Moore is mostly correct in his assertions, this story needs to be told, and it's OK for the story to be told from different angles (such as this movie), so I recommend this movie to anyone who cares about the future of our country.  Just keep in mind that this movie is only an introductory expos on the topic, so you'll need to delve deeper and more rigorously to really understand the nuts and bolts of what's going on.",1270166400,,2344,4.891414141414141
3968918,5,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore has made one of his best documentaries so far, showing how the criminal Wall Street bankers performed their ""financial coup d'tat"" in 2008.

To begin with, under Reagan, they pushed the deregulation process.  One of the best scenes of this movie is the chairman of Merrill Lynch saying to Reagan while he was actually delivering a speech : ""you have to speed it up"".  It is one of those very rare instants when you actually see who is acting and who is in control !  After the Wall Street boys got their deregulation, they invented all kind of new ways to make money in their insane casino, one of them being called ""derivatives"".  Moore asked some Wall Street gurus, including a Harvard professor, to have us explained what a ""derivative"" is, and neither of them succeeded.  And that's exactly the point.  Make it complicated, and project high returns, and no questions will be asked.

The banks made a home run.  They got in trouble, but taxpayers were invited to pay for it.  In 2008, Bush used the old trick of 9/11 again, and used *fear* to orchestrate what Moore calls a ""financial coup d'tat"".  Two months before election, we were told by the mass media that ""the economy would collapse"" if banks were not saved.  That was a major fraud.  Through a backdoor agreement involving the president and the president-to-be, an agreement was reached to inject $700 billion of tax money in the criminal banks.

In the meantime, people have lost their houses, and are still losing them, at a flabbergasting rate of every 7.5 seconds !  Moore makes an important point when showing how the middle class lived 30 to 40 years ago : one wage-earner was enough to support a whole family, own a house, have a car, take yearly vacations, have health care, could rely on a pension, etc.  This model looks from a distant past, although it was part... of our childhood !  Wages have been in steady decline since the 80's, and pensions and health care have been privatized.  In the process, the middle class is virtually ruined.

Citibank calls what's left of the US democracy a ""plutonomy"".  Following their definition this is an economy ""powered by and for the benefit of the wealthy"".  Following the same memo, the top 1 % of the American households has more wealth than the bottom 95% combined.  Moore also highlights the fact that this memo considers ""the most potent and mayor threat is societies demanding a more ""equitable"" share of the wealth"".

If the economic system fails and if the democracy is not working at all, then maybe it's time to go back to the essence of honest business and real democracy.  One of the solutions highlighted by Michael Moore are cooperatives, where the pay is fairly distributed, and decisions are made together.  As complementary reading, I would recommend John Abram's<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Companies-We-Keep-Revised-Expanded-Employee-Ownership-and-the-Business-of-Community-and-Place/dp/160358000X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Companies We Keep (Revised & Expanded): Employee Ownership and the Business of Community and Place</a>.

Obama, aka: Barry Soetoro, someone very familar with the Constitution has never even provided acceptable proof of US citizenship, such a certified copy of his birth certificate with doctor's signature like every other person has to provide. There is good reason to believe that he was not even legally eligible to be a US Senator, much less the US President.  How much help will he be when/if proved to be a complete fraud and puppet?

I urge Michael Moore to get away from the old left/right paradigm and look at the facts regardless of political party.  We need people in office who still defend the US Constitution and will work to comply with it, not abuse it over and over again.

If you have watched HBO's ""ROME"", you can see what the USA is becoming with tyrants cloaking their actions in the name of the ""republic"" with all sorts of political games, propaganda, martial law, wars, circuses, parades, and murder. Some playing to the ""noblemen"" and others to the common ""plebs"" in order to maintain their power. It is looking far too familar.

It's not just about Republicans or Democrats, it's about crooks on both sides of the issue. All are accountable in this current and ongoing financial mess.

From Hannity's God-Ronald Regan himself, to Clinton and W, this was a never ending cycle not so much of capitalism, but of greed overall.

Banks, Corporations, and money running this country. The Treasury department full of AIG people allowing fellow competition to fail while fattening their own pockets and that of their friends.

All are accountable. This movie really hits home when you see every day people being jived by the very people designed to take care of them. People loosing their homes and being thrown into the streets, one Congress-woman fired up with all the shenanigans going on while at the same time, leading Democrats are making back door deals with Bush and the Republican parties not for the betterment of the country, but for their own re-election.

The outcry became, do nothing, jobs are lost, economy collapses. So in their own personal survival greed, the Congress reached across the board and bailed the very banks who brought us to the brink of economic armageddon, only to see those banks payout their own bonuses before anything else.

In the true world of Capitalism, if you fail, you fail. Nobody bails out homeowners who lose their homes and are thrown into the street. Capitalism in reality is survival of the fittest, and yet here, when the Banks and mortgage companies failed, the Congress, not the people, bailed them out.

3968942,1,B002QW7ALW,"I must start this review by stating that I generally find Michael Moore's films to be quite entertaining. I don't know how many people he has capturing this footage, but it's uncanny how he is able to bring such raw emotion to bear, telling a story that, on the surface is quite compelling. But while Mr. Moore's movies tend to be entertaining, they prove but one certainty: This man knows much more about making movies than he does about basic economics.

Capitalism begins with a look at the effects of the housing crisis. Mr. Moore shows clips of families being tossed, violently in some cases, from their homes, but what he fails to mention is why. Yes, it's terribly sad to watch someone lose everything, but a little back story would be nice. Is it implausible that these people were acting negligent? Really, must we assume that that they were ALL doing everything right? Mr. Moore, you used to act like you thought I was intelligent.

Part of how Mr. Moore attempts to evoke anger in the viewer is when he visits Miami, Florida, and the firm ""Condo Vultures."" The owner is essentially picking up the pieces of the Miami housing market, looking for condos at rock-bottom prices. The lack of narrative is, I guess, a reflection the director's view that we should all see this guy as some sort of criminal. But what Mr. Moore fails to understand is that the Condo Vultures are doing an absolutely essential task -they are PRICING TOXIC ASSETS. Without a price (even a low one), these things will remain vacant and unkept forever. The government, try as they may, cannot simply wave a wand and fix this problem. Even in a socialist society, there would be prices assigned to condos. Know a high-powered politician? You get the condo by the beach. Are you a family of peasants? You're in the slums. No matter what you do or how hard you work, your class is your class and there's virtually no way to change that. At least in this society, people like Michelle Obama can work hard and control their own destiny. People will always desire, you cannot remove that characteristic, but in a society based on ""fair"" distribution, prices are reflected in the amount of time one must wait in line to get bread, or the lengths one must go to get close to a powerful head of state, not the amount of studying one is welling to do, or the rigor in which one is willing to save.

One disturbing part of this documentary is the part where Mr. Moore visits a former Wal-Mart employee whose wife died suddenly from an asthma attack. Now, please to not mistake this critique for a lack of sympathy, because it is not, and I feel horrible for their loss. But had Mr. Moore even taken a second to think this simple concept through, he would have realized that it is complete nonsense.  To understand why, must first understand why life insurance exists: to protect survivors in the case of unexpected loss of a financial contributor. When you purchase life insurance, you are paying MORE than the cost of the actual risk associated with death. Suppose an actuary finds that 1:1000 people dies every year. So to get a $1000 life insurance policy may cost the policy holder $2/year. When that 1 person dies, the insurance company just collected $2000 from every 1000 people they insure and will wind up with $1000 profit and pay out $1000. So when applied to the Wal-Mart case, it's impossible that Wal-Mart made a profit as the movie states, because the more people they take out life insurance policies on, the more money they are giving to the insurance company. In our little insurance example, insuring 1000 employees would cost $2000, and return $1000 to the policy holder of the 1 employee that died. If Wal-Mart insured every employee, it would cost them a huge sum of money! And suppose Wal-Mart was actually making money (in the aggregate) insuring their employees. Do you really think that any sane insurance company would let this go on for long? Now way! Insurance companies want to make a profit too, and they are under no legal obligation to insure anybody.

Mr. Moore's critique of the situation in the airline industry is particularly troubling, and shows his very limited understanding of the very simple concept of supply and demand. He makes the argument that pilots, for no other reason than the fact that he doesn't want them ""counting change in the cockpit,"" should make more money. But to understand this, one must ask themselves why they make so little in the first place? It seems like a relatively challenging job, one which forces a person to spend vast amounts of time away from their families. Moore's answer: pilots fly because they love to, no matter the cost (meaning opportunity cost, or the cost of not doing a job that makes more money like, as he stated in the film, working as a manager at a fast-food restaurant). Well, unfortunately there are a lot of jobs that people love to do, but if the economy has no need for them, then they must look for other work. If pilots are only making $19,000/year, then maybe the economy is telling future pilots (like the young man from the film that wants to grow up and become a pilot) to look for other lines of work. Get a plane, fly it in your spare time, but do it for leisure because we need more ______s! Even if we were to live in Moore's utopia, there would still be too many pilots, but there, the pilots that did it for the love of it (better know as those making $19,000/year) wouldn't even be able to have the job they so desired. This society would assign jobs to people, and if you wanted to be a pilot (or a moviemaker) and didn't get lucky or have an ""in"" in government, tough, you're the trashman, and you don't even get the proper compensation which is afforded trashmen (or women) in capitalism.

The great irony of this flop is the paradoxical thinking exhibited by Mr. Moore. On one hand, he chastises politicians for acting like humans have always and will always act, but on the other he advocates bestowing more power in them. At least Karl Marx's argument hinged on the phony notion that a new ""socialist man"" would rise, inspired by the new socialist society. Mr. Moore doesn't pay credence to the fact that a bigger bureaucracy means bigger corruption and more of the same problems. If his desire was merely to expose the fact that politicians are in bed with corporations, he succeeded, but if he wanted any sane person to think that a heavier hand of state was the answer, his attempt was abysmal.

History has proven time and time again that socialism is a failed experiment. Capitalism may mean uneven prosperity, but socialism ultimately means shared destitution. The apple of socialism will always hang low provided people like Mr. Moore are able to make it sound so sweet, but one need look no further than Hitler's German, Stalin's Russia, or more recently, Chavez's Venezuela to see that socialism merely causes the problems that it promises to solve.

Mr. Moore ends this documentary with a call-to-arms to all of the socialists watching. And in a way, he's right; we should stand up for the people. Now is the time that we should look to government to get out of the way and allow capitalism to work its magic and continue doing what it has done for humanity thus far -bring people out of poverty.",1268179200,51,7294,4.622685185185185

3968947,1,B002QW7ALW,"It's that time of year again when the world freshens up, spring is in the air and the world comes alive. Well with the exception of the release of a new film by Michael Moore. Talk about a downer. Nothing fresh here but rather more Moore ranting about how terrible a country is that pays him millions of dollars to make movies that fewer and fewer people are going to see.

CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY is anything but. What it basically boils down to is Moore's view that capitalism is an evil idea that should be abolished and replaced by socialism. So instead of a system that uses incentive to get people to work harder to make something of themselves, Moore would be happier if we all just tossed what we made into a pot and dispersed it equally to everyone. An easy thing to believe while being paid the amounts of money he gets.

Moore uses several tactics that have worked for him before. The first is making fun of the stereotypical American family with mom, dad and the kids all living idyllic lives. He treats this as if it is a thing of the past, the good old days ruined now by corporate America.

His next tactic is to label a bad guy, which in Moore's world are corporate big wigs. Their only concern seems to be making money for the company that they are in charge of, which is actually what they are paid to do. In Moore's eyes this should be about making money for the workers instead of the stockholders who invested money in the company to begin with.

Then again he never notes that there are more pieces to the puzzle than he lists. Not mentioned are unions that got their employees more money/benefits that the company has to pay resulting in less money to go towards employees resulting in cut jobs or the state of the economy which would raise or lower the costs of goods, etc. But these aren't important to Moore who has an axe to grind, facts be damned!

Moore pulls out his best trick several times: tugging at the heartstrings of the viewer. He does so here using his own father, walking with him down a broken sidewalk where the plant his father once worked in now stands demolished. When he asks his father what he remembers most, what his best memories of working there were he responds ""The people"".

He also takes us to meet people who have been evicted from their homes. I have a great sympathy for anyone in this position. But Moore uses them, making them look like poor innocents who have been mistreated. With the exception of one family who fell on hard times, he never explains why they were forced into this position or even if the bank tried to work with them. Cue violins, pass the tissues.

I will grant that documentaries are supposed to come with the film maker's point of view. But Moore has done such a shoddy job of avoiding numerous facts while using outlandish ones to support his ideas that it's become hard to take him seriously. He also tends to attempt to advance his ideas using emotions rather than facts. Toss in the fact that he's biting the hand that feeds him and you have to wonder why he continues or why those companies would give him money.

Your politics and beliefs will skew the way you look at this film. At one time I was a big Moore fan, loved ROGER & ME (before I found out about the short cuts and alterations of truth contained in it), loved his TV series and thought Moore stood for something. The more I look deeper into the man and his films, the more I discover that he's less for telling the truth, for getting to the bottom of things and more about pushing an agenda. I was taught that documentaries were to promote and objective look at a topic with perhaps a slight tilt towards the beliefs of the film maker. In Moore's case we get all the film maker's beliefs and little objectivity.

With several web sites taking the time to point out the twisting of facts and outright lies told in Moore's past films, one has to wonder just how much he's done so on this one. In this film he avoids the fact that greed, not capitalism, is the heart of the problem. And there is greed on both sides of the issue.

Perhaps the only thing different about this film than others Moore has done is who he attacks. This time around he doesn't limit those to Republicans but goes after both sides. Chances are this will result in fewer people taking him seriously. Then again with the box office returns on this film, I think that's been demonstrated already.

For a fair and objective observation on the topic, pass this one by. If you think capitalism is terrible though, you'll love it. And if you are a die hard Moore fan, you'll get what you are looking for.",1268092800,21,4622,4.394152046783626

3968950,5,B002QW7ALW,"You either love or hate Michael Moore. There is - as far as I can tell - no in-between. I happen to love the man, because he is a filmmaker that goes after the bad guys with no sympathy or compromise - the way it should be. You can't be nice or make deals with people whose policies kill human beings. Moore has gone after them over and over with, for example, ""Bowling for Columbine ""(2002), ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" (2004), ""Sicko"" (2007), and he does it again with the fascinating and powerful ""Capitalism: A Love Story.""

The film is really a compendium of many stories put together, all of them providing evidence of the destructive nature of the capitalist system. Moore immediately makes the connection and establishes similarities between the rise and fall of ancient Rome with the United States under George Bush II. From then on, Moore visits some folks that have been evicted from their homes due to the current mortgage crisis created by Wall Street, showcasing one fellow -- a vulture -- that sells homes from evicted people, and who says that he ""got the desire to get advantage of other misfortunes,"" claiming that ""this is straight capitalism."" Moore traces back the crisis to 1980, when Wall Street and corporate U.S.A. got in sync thanks to the Ronald Reagan administration, laying the foundations for the culture of short-term profits and massive lay-offs.  He goes on to use examples in the airline and insurance industries, where these practices are actually costing lives. At one point, Moore says that if Jesus comes back, he will say, ""Sorry, I can not heal your pre-existing condition.""  The film takes us to current times, showing how government financial deregulation created the current financial catastrophe, and how this situation let us to September 15, 2008, when the meltdown of our financial system occurred. Moore also connects these problems to all the Goldman-Sachs executives that have had influence in the White house. But Moore also gives hope, providing us with examples of people fighting back, like the companies in which the employees are the owners, and how people can affect Washington lawmakers with their votes.

""Capitalism: A Love Story"" hits you in the gut. There is a lot of information here to think about, and to maybe take action. This is what Michael Moore asks, and this is really all we can do. The DVD is loaded with extras, such as ""The Omnivore's Dilemma? It's Capitalism,"" ""How to run the place where you work,"" ""NY Times Pulitzer Prize Winner Chris Hedges on the Killing Machine Known as Capitalism,"" ""The Banks Kick them Out, Max kicks them back in,"" and much, much more.

3968962,1,B002QW7ALW,"A friend invited me to a private screening of this film. The invite, not surprisingly, leaned in a certain direction:

""Moore takes us into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have been turned upside down; and he goes looking for explanations in Washington, DC and elsewhere. What he finds are the all-too-familiar symptoms of a love affair gone astray: lies, abuse, betrayal and 14,000 jobs being lost every day. Capitalism: A Love Story is Michael Moore's ultimate quest to answer the question he's posed throughout his illustrious filmmaking career: Who are we and why do we behave the way that we do?""

Considering Moore was going to be there for a Q&A after (moderated by Arianna Huffington), I quickly signed on. Now before painting a picture of Moore's new film, let me be honest: my belief set is essentially libertarian (""Government out of my bedroom and my pocketbook""). Not only do government solutions not excite me, they scare the living blank out of me. Remember when George Bush declared, ""I've abandoned free-market principles to save the free-market system to make sure the economy doesn't collapse""? He might as well of said, ""Hide your money, kids -- 'cause I'm coming to take it!""

Oh sure, in theory I would like to see everyone with their own homestead, money in their pocket for regular shopping frenzies, and no health worries despite eating at Burger King 24/7, but arriving at those goals is not exactly doable unless government robs Peter to pay Paul and/or starts up the printing press.

And that view of course puts me in opposition to Moore since he has no problem with government as his and our father figure. That is his utopia. He truly believes that warehouses of federal workers, in Washington, D.C., remotely running our lives is the optimal plan. He is an unapologetic socialist who really doesn't care why the poor are poor or the rich are rich, he just wants it fixed. So not surprisingly -- and with some generalization as I proffer this -- Democrats like Moore and Republicans don't.

However, I was excited to see a ""mainstream"" film that was backed by big Hollywood bucks conclude capitalism is ""evil."" Arguably the most successful documentarian ever -- a man who has made untold millions of dollars -- was going to legitimately make the case that there was an alternative to capitalism. I sat down in a packed Mann's Bruin Theatre in Westwood, California, eager to see how his vision could possibly flesh out.

Moore is a rather simple guy. He is likable. He sees the world as good guys (people with no money) and bad guys (people with money). His Flint, Michigan, union-worker upbringing is his worldview. If you did not have that upbringing or if your life started less severe than his, you are an evil capitalist. If, on the other hand, you are a laid-off factory worker with a sixth-grade education, you are a true hero.

I don't care one way or the other that he has that view and I am not knocking union workers, but Moore sees the world through a class-warfare lens resulting in a certain agenda: force wealth to be spread amongst everyone regardless of effort.

Within minutes it was clear where Capitalism: A Love Story was headed.

We listen to heartbreaking stories of foreclosed families across America -- but we don't learn why the foreclosures happened. Did these people treat their homes as piggy banks? Was there refinancing on top of refinancing just to keep buying mall trinkets and other goodies with no respect to risk or logic? We don't find out.

We meet one family that is so desperate for money that they were willing to accept $1,000 for cleaning out the house that they were just evicted from. Was it sad? Yes. But should we end capitalism due to this one family in Peoria, IL?

We are introduced to a guy whose company, called Condo Vultures, is buying and selling foreclosed properties. Since he acted like a used car salesman, the implication was that he was an evil capitalist. However, Moore doesn't tell us if his buyers were ""working-class"" people making smart buying decisions after prices had dropped.

We listen to Catholic priests who denounce capitalism as an evil to be eradicated. What would they put in its place and how would the new system work? The priests don't tell us.

We learn that Wal-Mart bought life insurance policies on many workers. We are then told to feel outrage when Wal-Mart receives a large payout from an employee death while the family still struggles with bills. I saw where Moore was heading here, but is this a reason to end capitalism?

We hear a story from a commercial pilot so low on money that he has to use food stamps. Moore points out that many pilots are making less than Taco Bell managers and then attributes a recent plane crash in Buffalo to underpaid pilots. This one crash is extrapolated as yet another reason to end capitalism.

I was pleasantly surprised at Moore's attempt at balance. For example, he included a carpenter who, while boarding up a foreclosed home, says, ""If people pay their bills, they don't get thrown out.""

There is also a dressing-down of Senator Chris Dodd (D) by name. Moore called out a top Democrat? He sure did. He nailed him.

There is a lengthy dissertation on the evils of Goldman Sachs. He rips Robert Rubin and Hank Paulson big time, and I agree with him. In fact, I said to myself, ""Moore, you should have done your whole film on Goldman Sachs!""

Throughout the various stories and interviews he also weaves a conspiracy theory (all Moore films do this). The plot goes something like this: America won World War II and quickly dominated because there was no competition (Germany and Japan were destroyed). We had great postwar success where everyone lived in union-like equality. Jobs were plentiful and families were happy. However, things started to go bad in the 1970s -- here Moore uses a snippet of President Carter preaching about greed. This clip was predictably building to Moore's big reason for all of today's problems: the Reagan Revolution.

Moore sees Reagan entering the scene as a shill for corporate-banking interests. However, everyone is happy as the good times roll all the way through into Clinton era. Moore does take subtle shots at President Clinton, but nails his right-hand economic man, Larry Summers, directly as a primary reason for the banking collapse. While Moore sees Japan and Germany today as socialistic winners where corporations benefit workers more than shareholders, he sees America sinking fast.

So is that it? That was the proof that capitalism is an evil to eliminate? Essentially, yes, that's Moore's proof.

What is his solution? Tugging on your idealistic heartstrings of course! Moore ends his film with recently uncovered video of FDR talking to America on January 11, 1944. Looking into the camera, a weary FDR proposed what he called a second Bill of Rights -- an economic Bill of Rights for all -- regardless of station, race, or creed -- that included:

* the right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;
* the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;
* the right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;
* the right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;
* the right of every family to a decent home;
* the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;
* the right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;
* and the right to a good education.

As FDR concluded and the film ended, I was shocked at the reaction. The theater of 400-plus spectators stood and cheered wildly at FDR's 1944 proposal. The questions running through my head were immediate: how does one legislate words like useful, enough, recreation, adequate, decent, and good? Who decides all of this and to what degree?

Interestingly, during the Q&A, Huffington and Moore discussed bank-failure fears during the fall of 2008. They asked for a show of hands of how many people moved money around or attempted to protect against a bank failure. I had the only hand that went up.

FDR's plan, hauled out by Moore six decades after it was forgotten, reminded me of another interchange -- this one from the 1970s. Then talk-show master -- the Oprah of his day -- Phil Donahue was interviewing free-market economist Milton Friedman and wanted to know if Friedman had ever had a moment of doubt about ""capitalism and whether greed's a good idea to run on?""

Friedman was quick in response:

""Is there some society you know that doesn't run on greed? You think Russia doesn't run on greed? You think China doesn't run on greed? ... The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn't construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn't revolutionize the automobile industry that way. In the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty you're talking about, the only cases in recorded history are where they have had capitalism and largely free trade. If you want to know where the masses are worst off, it's exactly in the kinds of societies that depart from that. So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear: that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system.""

Donahue (and the video of this on YouTube is classic) then countered saying that capitalism doesn't reward virtue, but instead rewards the ability to manipulate the system. Friedman was having none of it:

""And what does reward virtue? You think the communist commissar rewards virtue? ... Do you think American presidents reward virtue? Do they choose their appointees on the basis of the virtue of the people appointed or on the basis of their political clout? Is it really true that political self-interest is nobler somehow than economic self-interest? ... Just tell me where in the world you find these angels who are going to organize society for us?""

Friedman's logic was what I was remembering as a theater full of people cheered wildly for a second Bill of Rights. How did this film crowd actually think FDR's 1944 vision could be executed? Frankly, it was clear to me at that moment that capitalism is on shaky ground. From Bush ""abandoning"" capitalism to bailouts for everyone, to Obama gifting away the future, we seriously might be past the point of no return toward a socialization of America.

Figuring someone else must see the problems with this film, I started poking around the net for other views. One critic declared that the value of Capitalism: A Love Story was not in the moviemaking, but in its message that hits you in the gut and makes you angry. This film did not make me angry, but it did punch me in the gut. The people in that theater with me, including Moore, were not bad people. They just seem to all have consumed a lethal dose of Kool-Aid.

At the end of his Q&A, Moore pushed the audience to understand that while they don't have the money, they do have the vote. He implored them to use their vote to take money from one group to give it to another group. Did he really say that openly with no ambiguity? Yes, sadly.",1267833600,53,11573,4.768115942028985

One of the most interesting things to look at is the ""Human Development Index"" which you can look at on Wikipedia. The United States does not rank in the top 10 while 7 european countries do. Wikipedia also has a ""list of countries by income equality"" which is interesting to note because all of the countries that ranked in the top 10 on the Human Development Index have a smaller ""wealth gap"" than the United States. This certainly isn't conclusive but interesting to learn about.

It seems that one of the most important factors regarding global economic equality is organized labor(Unions). But in order for unions to be truly effective, they have to be GLOBAL. The reason for this is that business owners will just move production from a unionized country to a non-unionized country in order to increase profit margins.",1267315200,13,1034,4.942528735632184
3968966,1,B002QW7ALW,"This documentary has evaded the law of identity. What Michael Moore is criticising is corruption, not capitalism. There are negatives and disadvantages to all economic systems, but Moore does not focus upon the bad aspects of capitalism, but instead the unethical practices which people have exploited others, within the current American economic system. Most economist would agree that America is not currently a pure capitalist economic system, it is a mixxed economy. Moore is part of an agenda which is encouraging the shift towards, higher taxes, bigger government, less free market practices. This is to the determent of all Americans. I would urge anyone to gain a comphrensive understanding of laissez faire capitalism from an unbiased point of view, rather than be manipulated by Moore's dramatised depiction of victims who were manipulated by predators to believe that the housing bubble would not crash. Moore's portrayal of 'the bankers' as capitalist has personally made me lose respect for him. Those people are not capitalist, they are common criminals who have violated the princicple of capitalism and the free market, a representation of political corruption, cronyism and outright robbery, all civilizations have had the misfortune of having such parasites, whether capitalist, communist or feudal. Moore knows this, I hope his audience do too.",1267228800,35,1363,5.464454976303317
3968967,5,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore's parting words in this documentary serve as a great summary of what he was trying to convey in his film:

""We live in the RICHEST country in the world. We all deserve a decent job, health care, a good education, a home to call our own. We all deserve FDR's dream. And it is a CRIME that we don't have it. And we never will, as long as we have a system that enriches the few at the expense of the many. Capitalism is an evil and you cannot regulate evil. You have to eliminate it and replace it with something that is good for ALL people. And that something is called DEMOCRACY.""

Side Note: FDR's dream was the following (from his January 11, 1944 message to Congress on the State of the Union) -

It is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy for the winning of a lasting peace and the establishment of an American standard of living higher than ever before known. We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people--whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth--is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure.
[...]
A new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all--regardless of station, race, or creed.
Among these are:
* The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;
* The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;
* The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;
* The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;
* The right of every family to a decent home;
* The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;
* The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;
*The right to a good education.
All of these rights spell security.
[...]
America's own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens.
[...]
FOR UNLESS THERE IS SECURITY HERE AT HOME, THERE CANNOT BE LASTING PEACE IN THE WORLD.",1267228800,29,2286,4.530266343825666
3968968,2,B002QW7ALW,"Once again we go on a familiar journey as Roger Moore finds outrageous situations to provoke thought. A lot of the stuff is biased and one sided. For instance, we see a foreclosed family getting evicted but there has to be more to the story. What did they do with the money they got from the bank using their home as collateral? He seems to pick out the worst of society and then blames it on the government. For instance, the closed factories of Flint Michigan are shown. Who told GM to build Hummers and gargantuan beasts of steel that fall apart and nobody wants to buy? He should visit a Toyota factory in Tennessee or a Honda factory in Ohio where they are building quality cars that people actually want to buy and have no regrets about. This DVD is entirely one sided but it has a lot of Roger Moore humor to get a point across. It's obvious he hates George Bush and Ronald Reagan but doesn't mention that it was Bill Clinton who deregulated the banks so they can essentially do Casino gambling with our money. I'm no fan of big business or the banks but both sides of the story needs to be portrayed for fairness. In Roger Moore's world he makes up our mind for us and then spends the whole film justifying his position.

It is very unfortunate that this movie did not get the acclaim that it should have.  More people should see it. It opens our minds and our hearts to the fact that capitalism is at the bottom of all this.  Right in front of our eyes ""capitalism"" says that profit is more important than human need.  How could this be?  Is it more important for someone to make a profit or to give a needed operation to a sick child?  Moore's attention to fundamental Judaic-Christian-Islamic values ultimately, that emphasize duties to one another and to ""do things to the least of these"" is noteworthy and refreshing.  It is as if such fundamental spiritual wisdom has become lost.  How unfortunate!  It is a very moving film, especially toward the end when he has President Roosevelt give his famous Four Freedoms speech.  In the mid 20th century, the US was such a moral leader.  What happened?  The movie could have been enhanced if Mr. Moore then spoke about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which to a large degree is a legacy of Roosevelt's Four Freedoms.  The Universal Declaration, which includes rights to worship, rights to work, health care, adequate shelter, and security in old age, is now increasingly referred to as customary international law, which all nations must abide.

He has turned into a Ralph Nader type character--the right message, but an ""ego-gone-wild"" messenger which hurts what the director is hoping to accomplish.",1265932800,3,577,5.260869565217392
3968971,5,B002QW7ALW,"This fantastic and emotional film is yet another masterpiece by the great film maker Michael Moore.  It is a scathing indictment of how our increasingly flawed Capitalist system is often used to line the pockets of special interests (including large banks), and how real Americans suffer as a by-product of this.  Lobbyists and special interests have hijacked Washington, and whored themselves to large corporations, and the twin political parties of Capitalism have blurred the lines and differences between them.  It seems that true Democracy is dying in America, and that it doesn't matter whether one votes for 'tweedledee' or 'tweedledum' (Repubs or Dems).  The rich are getting richer, job security (if you have a job to begin with) has fallen by the wayside, and our unsustainable healthcare system is derailing, with millions precluded from getting the care they need.  It seems like America's better years are behind us, and we need to do something about this before the quiet desperation of our middle classes becomes as apparent as that of our poor and forgotten in this country!",1265760000,12,1090,5.135593220338983

Even if you are aware of the current state of our country to some degree, this movie will shed much more light on the history behind it. It is an absolute travesty. I'm currently taking a college class called social stratification and so much of what is in Moore's movie is in my textbook. Moore sticks to the facts; there is no need to lie or embellish when the facts are bad enough. Every single American should see this movie. If you are moved by it, then share it with others.

3968973,5,B002QW7ALW,"The short list of what can be considered documentary film classics has yet another wonderful addition by legendary filmmaker Michael Moore. It is a visual spanning of the history of corporate influence over our political leaders and how this has poisoned the entire establishment nearly beyond repair. I will never forget the segment of a presidential speech, showed roughly around the beginning of this film, of a man standing behind president Reagan who leans in and says angrily in his ear: ""HURRY IT UP; WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY!"" The camera then freezes on Reagan's shocked face as the narrator simply asks, ""Who speaks to the president like this?"" It graphically shows you how much influence is measured by the corporations over our political leaders. This film in particular strikes higher notes than Moore's previous films in that it takes you back to the roots of earlier documentaries and brings out more ample and articulate forms of evidence in support of the general thesis. Capitalism: A Love Story seeks to expose the corruption of our varied form of greedy Capitalism, and to replace it with a more democratized base system, typically referred to as Leftist-Libertarianism or Libertarian-Socialism.

People in the United States generally speak of Socialism as something awful, pointing to Russia and China as examples of the dangers of far leftist thought. But if they would simply take the time to read into some of their literature of political theory, they would realize that there are branches within the movement which are infinitely distinct from those totalitarian nations. It is a category mistake to assume that socialism entails totalitarianism, as if what you see in Russia and China were totally across the board.

3968975,4,B002QW7ALW,"One hundred percent Michael Moore, no doubt what-so-ever. Emotional to the utmost. Founded on undeniable facts and truths, note the plural of these truths. He oscillates between the good old Christian truth, the good old socialist truth, the good old founding fathers' truth, and even the good old Framers' truth, without forgetting even the truth of F.D. Roosevelt. Only one is missing, Abraham Lincoln. The point is that the Founding Fathers and the Framers were building a constitution  that excluded the majority of the population  of the first United States and were to exclude that majority for quite a while (Blacks, women, Indians, non-propertied and non-taxable residents). The Constitution is of course something that can be perfected but the meaning of the quotations from and by them Framers and Founding Fathers has to be taken in their context if we want to capture their truths. And that's the main problem with Michael Moore: he builds a patchwork of quotations, references and facts that has an emotional meaning and impact but that does not stand any serious reflection. Instead of building an argumentation that would be homogeneous in time and place, absolutely impregnable in logic, he overkills his single targeted bird with a dozen of stones and a few bullets, and even here and there a rocket. That overkilling alas neutralizes the argument and sterilizes the demonstration because of the anachronistic nature of many of the arguments and the non articulated nature of the accumulative train of his thought, or rather thinking. Of course capitalism is greed, and it is all the horrors that lead to the worst crimes and wars. But the market economy is not capitalism. The market economy is here to stay because the economy, that exists since the beginning because the homo sapiens is an economic species, can only bring us the future and more means and more justice, but capitalism is only one way of managing that market economy and it is the worst way possible nowadays. And alas the film leads us to some vague democratic ideal in the workplace. What is it? A cooperative form of management? Or a more important and decisive role for the unions and the workers' representatives? Or plain state socialism? The film is in fact exploded in all these directions and brings no clear perspective, not even a direction that could have several slightly different lanes or roads. And we cannot forget that his antics in Wall Street are only possible because everyone in Wall Street accepts him to do it, including the bankers, the traders, the financiers and the police. That sounds and looks very well negotiated and produced. An interesting message but too emotional to lead very far on the highway to the future.

3968976,4,B002QW7ALW,"Unlike Michael Moore's scathing 2004 critique ""Farenheit 911,"" this film looks primarily at the last two to four years, and how the Bush Administration, with some serious help from the Democrat-controlled congress, has pushed America's middle class to the brink of financial catastrophe.

Some might say that Moore is a pessimist who manufactures dissent. But this time around, he takes his aim at both political parties, and the two party system in general, and claims that it makes no difference which party is in power - they are all corrupt and all we have left is the illusion of choice. By doing this, Moore is presenting a very unpleasant view of the state of the nation's finances.....but he is also more even-handed about his criticisms. He skews both Democrats and Republicans as he looks at the bailouts of Wall Street, and how current leaders from both parties have appointed Wall Street and corporate gurus to high positions in the US Treasury department, and they have all but stripped away the regulations put into place following the great depression. Then, when things got bad on Wall Street, Bush and the Democratic Senators used taxpayer funds to bail themselves out. Corruption at the highest levels.

One point where I disagree with Moore is that he also favors Socialism over a capitalist system, and he has no qualms about saying that on many occasions. He almost sets a tone of calling for citizens to revolt against the corporations, and he stops just short of doing so. Whether you approve of his antics or not, everyone can agree that our political leaders are corrupt and that the two party system is, as of right now, shaky at best. Simply getting mad, however, will not restore confidence. His one great suggestion that we should all adhere to is his demanding that more products be made in America by American workers. Love him or hate him, he does identify several trends that we as a country have let go the wrong direction for far too long.",1262736000,8,1974,4.802941176470588
3968977,4,B002QW7ALW,"Controversial documentarian Michael Moore has taken on some important news topics over the past two decades but perhaps none has affected every American more than the financial meltdown of Wall Street in 2008 as depicted in Capitalism: A Love Story.  Done in his customary style of news clips, interviews, and enactments, he has fashioned a convincing indictment of greedy bank executives while being engaging and at times enlightening.

He points out a startling fact: We used to be one income family, Wall Street and corporate profits were guided by sound principles, and our country had no business competition.  It's a kind of history lesson courtesy of Moore as he also notes parallels between the demise of Wall Street and that of the Roman Empire, a comparison not without merit.

His thesis is that since President Ronald Reagan came into office, the influence of Wall Street has increased to the point that, while Congress and the U.S. Treasury have promoted financial deregulation, many of them have direct links to financial giants such as Goldman Sachs.  It would seem on surface to be a major conflict of interest, and that is the point.  A handful of CEO's have benefited from running the country as a corporation and costing millions of jobs and livelihoods.

Moore ties news stories to an increasing pattern of corporate greed.  There is a juvenile facility in Pennsylvania financed by taxpayer money and corrupt public officials.  There are college students beholden to banks with student loans, and we witness news reports of a recent plane crash in Buffalo, New York, for what appears to be the lack of funds for safety issues.  Then there is the surprising practice of businesses like Wal-Mart that take out life insurance policies on its employees and collecting on the benefits.  By contrast, he does show examples of companies owned by workers that operate efficiently and at a profit.  His point is there can be win-win situations.

As Wall Street sold `derivatives', a risky form of corporate gambling, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that Americans tap the equity in their homes, and thus came the refinance boom for banks and a new found wealth for the masses-or was it?  Using a home like a bank was a formula for financial disaster as the housing industry collapsed with foreclosures and the banking industry fell too.  Moore makes his point with footage of actual foreclosures as sheriffs evict homeowners, and the cruelty is not only losing a home but in the cottage industry that has taken advantage of this agonizing process.  Added to this is the preferential treatment that CEO's gave to each other and many lawmakers regarding mortgage approvals.  The question that keeps being asked by Moore and others is `where were the regulators' in all this?

As Congress debated on how to repair the economy with a bailout of as much as $700 billion of taxpayer money, Wall Street used media abetted fear to manipulate lawmakers.  It was a politics of fear.  But not everyone was buying into the fear.  Some members of Congress were brave enough to tell a sobering tale of a lack of oversight versus corporate bonuses being fed by the bailout.

Moore shows that some people are fighting back.  A new President (Obama) ushers in the potential for change.  People are fighting foreclosures and forcing banks to prove chain of title.  The laid off workers at Republic Doors refused to exit the factory, and with media coverage and a supportive President, Bank of America caves in and agrees to pay the workers what is owed to them.  This event is not without precedent as Moore points out in 1936, workers at a GM Flint, Michigan plant also fought back.  In an ironic, fascinating piece of history of what might have been, President Franklin Roosevelt proposed but never lived to see a second Bill of Rights which would address virtually every important concern for Americans including health care, education, and financial security.

Then Moore makes this observation based on a private corporate memo that says 1% of the population in this country has 95% of the wealth but that the other 99% have an equal vote and the power to make changes (yet still hope to be part of the rich).  It is this equal vote that scares the corporate powers.  His conclusion is that the only hope for this country is for democracy to work.

Some things don't come off well in the film; Moore appears to be grandstanding when he rents an armored car to make a citizen's arrest of the CEOs of Wall Street and get back the public's money.  He even takes crime scene tape to cordon off bank doors.  Also, an interview with actor Wallace Shawn seems a bit out of place. Wouldn't an interview with an industry insider have worked better?  You may not agree with everything Moore espouses, but some of the information should cause anyone to research the facts and draw their own conclusions.  If you are a fan of his previous films Sicko or Fahrenheit 9/11, then you will appreciate Capitalism: A Love Story.",1258156800,9,5025,4.851113716295428
3968978,5,B002QW7ALW,"I am not sure I agree it is Michael Moore's best film. However, it is very thought provoking. I will get it as soon as it comes out on DVD. The film needs to be seen several times to get the whole story.

The reason I am not sure it is Michael's best is I do not think the story is told as straight forward as Sicko was, for example. He does make great use of old film clips to compare the current United States to the Roman Empire and to the Great Depression of the Thirties.

As usual he specializes in over the top stunts. Driving around New York in an armored car demanding our money back and stringing crime scene tape around the Stock Exchange are priceless.

The most moving part of the movie is his telling the story of what happened to his hometown, Flint MI. The scene of him and his father visiting the site of the no longer existing plant where he worked for 30 years was heart breaking.",1257724800,6,899,4.155172413793103

3968981,5,B002QW7ALW,"I enjoyed this movie. I think I know what Micheal Moore is trying to say. I was very impressed by the video of FDR explaining to the American people his additions to the current bill of rights. Michael is responsible for finding this ""lost"" video and good for him. Why has it never been shown before? Why was it hidden away? How could such a statement by such a great president ever get ""lost""? Why do so few Americans know the labor history of America? If it is not possible for workers, owners and consumers all to profit in a socially beneficial way, then all our dreams are impossible.

Surely FDR's second bill of rights is the direction in which our government should have been heading. These goals expressed by FDR are the American dream.  Instead of pursuing this American dream we got more war, hot and cold, and a bloated military industrial complex. What we have been experiencing since the end of World War II isn't even close to FDR's vision or Micheal's or mine.

Greed does not work and crime should not pay. As capitalist we all love entrepreneurship, private property,individualism and the opportunity to become wealthy but not at the expense or exploitation of other human beings - here in our home country or abroad. These capitalist benefits that we all respect can be achieved along with decency and a moral code. These capitalist ideals do not have to encourage selfishness, exclusion, ghettos and poverty nor do they have to promote destructive competition or monopolization. Adam Smith did not teach that unscrupulous, criminals pursuing their criminal goals would be guided by God's invisible hand. Adam Smith was a moralist speaking out against monopolization and power. Today he would be challenging the same lack of business morals by the controllers and international monopolization, I have no doubt.

Globalism is fine but not at the expense of our own people. Our nation's first obligation is to its people. Trading goods to the profit of a few Americans while sacrificing the livelihood of tens of thousands of Americans is pure insanity. It is self destructive no matter how cleaver it is explained.

3968982,3,B002QW7ALW,"Once again, Michael Moore has made a film which entertains and moves us, while making us think about important issues. And he deserves praise for highlighting the perversions and inequities in our system.  Unfortunately, his scapegoating of the entire free enterprise system and his proposed solution of ""Democracy"" do not rise above the level of demagoguery.

Like his other movies, ""Capitalism"" is not so much a documentary as it is a propaganda piece masquerading as a documentary.  In its zeal to make a point, the film rambles through a series of emotional anecdotes and provocative scenes.  It is at best incomplete and at worst incorrect in its analysis and conclusions.  Moore clearly knows little about what true capitalism is or should be, but it makes a convenient scapegoat for things he doesn't like in our society.

While watching the film, I kept thinking of the commonly misquoted expression ""Money is the root of all evil"".  But the true quote is ""The LOVE of money is the root of all evil.""  It's a distinction that many, including Mr. Moore miss.  The thesis of this film is that Capitalism equates to Greed which leads to the repression of the poor by the rich and is therefore Evil.  But the examples the film gives us are actually the result of the corruption of the system rather than the system itself.

The ideal of capitalism is not greed, but rather enlightened self-interest.  Greed is the perversion of that self-interest and it often leads to corruption.  And it is the results of that corruption that Moore rails against and that we should be justifiably angry about.  For example, it's hard to disagree with Moore that it is unconscionable that banks that receive billions in taxpayer bailouts should be foreclosing on homes that they sold toxic loans to.  But this is not the fault of capitalism, but rather the result of the system derailed through excessive corporate greed, power and government corruption.

In a true capitalist system, government's role is to ensure fair competition and open markets where individuals and firms acting freely and in their own self-interest lead to results that produce the most efficient allocation of resources, or ""the greatest good for the greatest number"".  And indeed capitalist systems have produced societies with unsurpassed standards of living.  The problem is that the system tends to get corrupted, in one of two ways.

In the first way, the one so well illustrated in this film, ""winners"" amass enough wealth and power to be able to control and corrupt the system designed to keep them in check.  This can lead to lead a backlash, which this film advocates, and the second type of corruption of the capitalist system, the seizing of resources from the rich and redistribution of wealth.  Moore euphemistically refers to this ""solution"" as ""Democracy"", but it is really his version of socialism.

For me, the biggest irony of the film is that while the atrocities it details are not really examples of capitalism so much as it's corruption, the film itself is a wonderful example of the benefits of capitalism.  Moore, a man from humble origins, has been able to apply his talents and hard work to create a film which others choose to produce and distribute, and we choose to pay to see.  To the extent the film succeeds, the marketplace rewards Moore, giving him the resources to produce more films and distribute them more widely.  As a society we are better off as a result.  And in that sense, the film's success is the best argument against it's anti-capitalist message.",1256688000,24,3557,4.896494156928214
3968983,5,B002QW7ALW,"Cut away the pro-union, pro-New Deal mushiness and Michael Moore's ""Capitalism, A Love Story"" has a vital core worth considering. Twenty years after ""Roger and Me,"" Moore shows he still has pop on his filmmaking fastball. At every point where I was ready to write off ""Capitalism"" as a fruitcake leftist screed, the writer/director/actor dug up a fresh angle I couldn't ignore. Unless you're on the board of Goldman Sachs, director of the George W. Bush Presidential Library, or both you'll likely conclude that ""Capitalism, A Love Story"" is a balanced movie.
 The film is testament to Kevin Spacey's 2009 comment about the arts being a necessity during a time of economic crisis. Hundreds of newscasts don't register on the mind and soul the way Moore's art does in minutes.
 Moore succeeds for the opposite reason that Tim Geithner fails up (fellow followers of the Mises/Austrian School see our exposition of the state and its purchased intellectuals affirmed by Moore in his take on Obama's Treasury secretary). Moore refuses to tell us what we want to hear or see. His brand of social criticism reminds me of one of Hillel's dictums in Judaism's Ethics of the Fathers (2:6) - ""...A person excessively involved in business cannot become a scholar and where there are no leaders strive to become a leader.""
 The artist is trying to put his finger on a big problem. While the moral poverty of the wealthy is a major issue it's far from the whole story. Moore's viewpoint is a blue-collar critic animated by Roman Catholic sentiment. After slogging through the beastly jungle to give us a new vantage point, the filmmaker ends his production with an appeal. This made me think that Moore wants ""Capitalism, A Love Story"" to fire people up and get them talking. If so, kudos to Moore.
 Yet anecdotes and a rich-vs.-poor mindset will take us only so far. These things are emotionally compelling yet they can mislead. For example, Moore opines that one of the main reasons that Americans suffer the inequities of capitalism is because most want some day to be in that top 1 percent income bracket. This is a thought I've long harbored and I'm glad an artist of Moore's stature has put it out for public reflection. But this is far from a sufficient explanation and the film points toward that. When the Countrywide mortgage executive says ""If I didn't do it someone else would have"" we glimpse something of the enormity - people aren't just morally lax; they desire to keep their jobs because of fears of letting their families down and losing the wealth that they have. This is not lost on Moore because elsewhere in the movie, in commenting on the 2008 pre-election bank bailout, he well surmises the power of fear.
 Moore's shorthand in labeling economic and social injustice ""capitalism"" is likewise too simplistic. To call people losing their homes to foreclosure ""capitalism"" is like calling the mass murders under Hitler, Mao, and Stalin ""socialism."" The terminology is imprecise. These situations are social crises.
 The filmmaker is right to see that business has gotten too big and impersonal. Although he's somewhat critical of government, Moore implies that big government (through more regulations and FDR-style proclamations of additional rights) will arrest the march of crony capitalism. His interviews with Roman Catholic clerics imply that big church might stop the raging bull of Wall Street. Funny that Moore begins his film comparing ancient Rome to modern America and leaves us with the impression that the form of Christianity bequeathed to us by the old empire is going to stop the slide of the United States. I'd like to say stranger things have happened but I can't think of anything stranger than this prospect.
 Moore will come much closer to the truth by reviewing his movie and realizing that bigness is inherently corrupting. America's Protestant culture and heritage must also be taken proper account of. What will right America is a block-by-block revolution in thinking and action that prizes communal mindedness (to use a term from a teacher of mine, Rabbi Mayer Schiller), humility, and brims with an ethos of ""small is beautiful."" May this come soon in our days. If and when it does Michael Moore's ""Capitalism, A Love Story"" will be regarded as an important road sign on our journey there.",1256169600,11,4325,4.940852819807428
3968984,2,B002QW7ALW,"I've seen several of Mike's films, found them interesting or amusing though sometimes deceptive.  This one I found below par, not because I totally disagree but because he didn't seem to know the subject well enough.

I can surely sympathize with people losing their homes, jobs, etc.  But it's sort of a quantum leap to go from that to Capitalism Is Evil.  He interviews his local priests, people being evicted, a Socialist, etc. to back himself up.  Fine, now what about the other side?  Well, we get comical shots of Bush, hints of a Great Evil behind the bank bailout, and people having trouble explaining a financial term to Moore.  To his credit, he at one point suggests that democracy is the most important standard to maintain in seeking solutions.  But you can have democracy (or corruption, even totalitarianism) in either capitalist or socialist societies.  Also, you can have socialist-type institutions in a capitalist society (fire dept., public library, etc.), as well as private business to different degrees in socialist countries.  In this film, unfortunately, any deeper consideration of capitalism falls victim to Moore's stunts, emotionalism, and intrusive music.

I went to see this film out of curiosity, because I'd seen others by him on serious subjects, but I now think Moore should leave these subjects to serious makers of documentaries.

I should add that I found the footage from Mike's childhood rather amusing, and the part on FDR's ""Second Bill of Rights"" was worth seeing.  So there is some wheat among the chaff.",1256083200,8,1548,5.047244094488189
3968985,5,B002QW7ALW,"Throughout his entire career as both an author of very left-leaning missives and a writer/director of subversive documentaries, Michael Moore has been a friend to many, and an enemy to just as many.  Whether it was with ROGER AND ME, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, or SICKO, Moore has shown that he has the power to enlighten or enrage.  And the same holds true for his latest missive, CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY.

In CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY, he goes a step further by putting the argument out there that our system of Capitalism is intrinsically evil.  If he is at all wrong in his assumption, the huge financial storms that rocked both America and the world at large in 2007 and 2008 prove that it isn't by much.  And he offers mountains of evidence to prove his point: a family loses a Peoria, Illinois farmhouse that has been in their possession for forty years due to unforeseen financial circumstances; workers at a Chicago construction firm are out of a job because Bank of America has foreclosed on them.  And this is really the tip of the iceberg.  During the 128 minute running time of CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY, Moore dissects how that economic concept that has held America's economy in place for so long got out of control, and how the warnings about greed overtaking the system were ignored for the love of money, thanks to the ascension of Ronald Reagan to the presidency, and the beginnings of a trend where there was collusion between our elected representatives and big, faceless, indifferent mega-corporations.  Regulatory rules were tossed out the window in the belief, swallowed whole by the American people during the Reagan and Bush Sr. eras, that wealth would trickle down from the top, a theory known then, as now, as ""trickle down economics.""  Of course, we know now, all too late it would seem, that this was largely smoke and mirrors, for while the richest 5% of Americans got wildly inappropriate tax cuts or tax breaks, the poor and middle class got The Shaft.

In a unique twist, Moore, left-leaning though he is, even goes to expose the people within the Clinton Administration who either worked in the Wall Street world either prior to coming into, or after leaving, his administration.  This is more fair-and-balanced than one might anticipate from Moore, and far superior that anything that Fox News could ever conjure up on a good day.

But Moore, good as he is at raising the ire of Americans through his traditional populist rage, also shows us how people can get together and make it very difficult for the corporations to do business in the predatory way that they had been doing it for three decades.  The employees of the Chicago construction firm decide to barricade themselves in their place of employment until Bank of America caves in, which is what happens.  Displaced residents of a foreclosed home in Miami call the bluffs of both the foreclosure agent and their own police department; they too win.  And with all the hoopla that was thrown about by the McCain/Palin GOP presidential ticket and the backwater idiot named Joe The Plumber about how much Barack Obama was somehow a socialist, it shows how the American people at large won, by declaring that they wanted the era of unbridled greed to come to a permanent end, and declaring it where it does the most good--at the Ballot Box.

There are, of course, the usual publicity gags that Moore performs to make his points, the very ones that make him the Right's favorite whipping boy: confronting security guards at the most corrupt mega-banks by driving up to their corporate offices in a Brink's armored truck; surrounding the A.I.G. building in New York City with yellow crime scene tape.  But the points he makes are serious, and worthy of consideration.  The plain truth of the matter is that, under a government-and-business collusion, capitalism in America has gone so far off the rails and cost what was once the richest and most powerful nation in history its prestige, and cost millions of hard-working Americans their jobs, and even their lives.

I don't know that Capitalism should be dismantled altogether, nor do I think it can be, at least not so easily as Moore suggests.  But without resurrecting regulations that protect average people in the future from the kinds of predatory loan practices that caused the near-collapse of our economy, Capitalism may yet have to be put on the ash heap of history.",1255824000,5,4427,4.822985468956407
3968986,4,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore seems to have sixth sense ability when he makes each of his films. Each new movie hits the multiplexes in a timely fashion, tapping into the zeitgeist surrounding what the story is attempting to explore, what the filmmaker wants to make the public aware of. With ""Capitalism: A Love Story"", Moore releases a film about the financial collapse of the United States while the collapse is still going on, while everyone is still feeling the affects of the meltdown. This should surely attract more than a few curious filmgoers and will hopefully expand Moore's ardent and loyal fan base.

That said, I didn't love ""Capitalism"". It's a good film, an interesting story, but it fails to connect with the viewer in the same way his other films, ""Bowling for Columbine"", ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" or ""Sicko"" connect.

It is a mistake to call Moore a documentarian. He explores various aspects of an idea, usually political, presenting various 'human interest' stories to support his thesis. He can't get anyone with an opposing viewpoint to talk to him because his tactics are too well known. I really think he is more of a film essayist.

Given that his films follow more or less the same formula most broadcast news programs cover, it seems more than a little ironic when these same programs attack him for bending the truth. Can any news program be called ""fair and balanced""? Can any news program go into any significant depth when they are so concerned with presenting 'human interest' stories about little kids flying in runaway balloons or in showing video of cats flushing toilets.

If you have seen any previous Moore films, this film, which also marks the 20tth anniversary of the release of his first film ""Roger & Me"", will seem familiar. Moore interviews various common folk involved in the larger picture he is trying to portray. These folks are victims and their stories often tug at our heartstrings. He also tries to interview politicians, business executives, lawmakers, anyone who is involved at a higher level. He actually gets a couple of elected officials to talk to him on camera, but these people are sympathetic to the cause. These interviews are mixed in with archival footage, news footage, charts, graphics and more all designed to help bolster Moore's arguments. And because Moore can't get anyone at a higher level to talk to him (with the exception of Charlton Heston in ""Bowling for Columbine"") he usually includes a few 'stunts' designed to create laughter in the audience.

There are two things that really make the best Michael Moore films stand out. First, his interviews with the common folk involved usually are so heart wrenching we leave the theater infuriated and ready to act. These people have been dumped on, big time, by circumstances beyond their control. In ""Capitalism"", we watch as a couple have to deal with being evicted from the wife's family property. The husband and some family members hastily box their belongings and stuff them into a truck. They don't have anywhere to go, but they are leaving a property that has been in the wife's family for decades. Then the sheriff shows up to evict them. But the husband explains that they are supposed to have thirty days to pack up. The sheriff is confused and makes some calls.

We also watch as another family goes through the eviction process. Moore's cameras are inside their house as we hear them talk and watch multiple sheriffs' deputies pull up to the house. Then, the pounding on the doors begins. The man of the house calls the sheriff and tells him they will leave, but they have to come in and get them, there are also four people in the house. Soon, the doors come down.

These are powerful moments, but he doesn't really show anyone else or any other affect of this financial crisis on the common man, on the people of ""Main Street"".

Another thing Moore always does well is to introduce us to people we never knew existed. In ""Capitalism"", we meet a real estate agent who works in Florida. He owns a company called Condo Vultures and tells us about the people who are vultures, buying up foreclosure properties for pennies on the dollar to resell it later at a profit. As he talks about what he does, he seems to have slight scorn and contempt for the people he works for. We watch as he shows two different condos to the same guy. But as we watch, we can't help but realize that this guy is capitalizing off of the vultures, making money when they do. Yet, he doesn't seem to realize his affect on society.

Moore is also good at uncovering facts and little pieces of information that tend to make the viewer's blood boil. This is where ""Capitalism"" falters. As an avid ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" fan, most of the shocking material Moore 'uncovers' has already been covered by Jon Stewart and ""Saturday Night Live"". For instance, in the original TARP bill was making its way through Congress, then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson included a provision in his very short bill preventing anyone from reviewing his decisions and bringing criminal action against him. This bill, thankfully, did not pass.

""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is sure to get your blood boiling, by reiterating much of the information you probably already know. But because Moore doesn't provide anything new or startling, anything revealing or telling, the film doesn't seem as memorable as his previous works.

Also, the stunt moments seem both oddly placed and a little sophomoric. Moore drives an armored truck up to some of the banks that received bail out money and takes a large bag (marked with a huge dollar sign no less) and demands out money back. Since he can't get in the buildings, he interacts with security guards who are simply doing as they were told. Considering they probably make about $7 per hour, these people are not the criminals. So the joke seems a little lost. Yet, Moore tries to milk it, tries to get some sort of response out of them.

Later, he returns and starts to string crime scene tape across the whole of Wall Street. That is a better idea; a more telling statement, but it seems almost lost as the film is coming to an end.",1255824000,2,6149,4.741814780168382
3968987,5,B002QW7ALW,"Once upon a time people were ""taught"" to think the King spoke for GOD and that was that. Today we are ""taught"" Capitalism is the ""natural order of things"" and ""works better than any other system"". Both arguments  were used to uphold the divine right of Kings. Some things never change. People want leaders. Why,is beyond me. Even the Old Testament tells Israel you may have your King but it will not make you happy. Great movie, Mike. Your best yet. Problem is, people do not have a vision of how to live in a world without ""Leaders"". Without a vision of non-hierarchical power structures people are clueless to what replaces them. Democracy was started into play in America,in a small way--but became still born by the 1840's. Since then it has just been a tool of power for the wealthy to steal from the poor. I really wish Michael Moore had stayed with and backed Ralph Nader. President Obama is going to break his heart. You told a great story, Mr. Moore. A true story. If you make a wonderful romantic comedy in which everyone turns out HAPPY! HAPPY! HAPPY!!! in the end with great wealth due to the wonders of Freedom and the Free Market you would make a ton of money.  I bet the folks that ran the Colosseum in Rome made a ton of money also. Thanks for the effort. In your ""Love Story"" you told the truth. People want the pretty lie. I loved how you re-cased Jesus as Milton Friedman,genius. Give my love to the good Fathers in your film. I really mean that. I have lived so long that the Roman Catholic Church has become less hierarchical than my government. More just also. Will go back and see the movie again and buy the DVD as soon as possible. Hope we meet in the streets someday. Now that would be change!!!!",1255219200,92,1722,4.411949685534591
3968988,3,B002QW7ALW,"Michael Moore's unique blend of populist politics and satirical humor has produced some impressive results in the past. But I found ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" to be only a partial success. The first half lacks focus, as Moore's tells some ancedotal stories about people who have been screwed over. They are moderately interesting and you do feel bad for the victims. But as an indictment of the entire capitalist system they fall far short. I think some sharper editing could have produced a tighter and more effective film

The second half picks up steam as Moore discusses the bank bailout, unions and the way that Reagan and both Bushes managed to ""rig the game"" in favor of the wealthy and powerful. He does attempt to offer a vision of a more just and equitable America, particularly in his discussion of FDR's ""Second Bill Of Rights""(which was never passed by Congress). But I found his idea of replacing capitalism (an economic system) with democracy (a political system) entirely too vague to be useful. This is still a film worth seeing but not as good as Moore's best work.",1255132800,4,1083,4.791443850267379
3968989,4,B002QW7ALW,"Moore has the right ideas, but he dumbs things down a little too much. And in doing so, he sometimes makes sweeping generalizations of some very complex issues.

He offers 'democracy' as an alternative to 'capitalism'. But democracy is a political term and capitalism is an economic one. They do not lie along the same spectrum.

Another example; he keeps criticising greed and the profit motive. But then what is the alternative? The real truth is that most persons act in their own self interest. That is what drives most of us and rightly so. Each person should have the freedom to protect her or his own interest first. You cannot force people to be charitable (and here I am not saying public funding for education, healthcare, social security is charity). The role of government is merely to make sure that the strong don't overwhelm the weak or are taken unfair advantage of. That is the opposite of what has been happening in the last decade or so with the aggressive deregulation of the banking and insurance industries.

What Moore is actually critical of is free market capitalism (along the lines of the Chicago school). And what he is proposing is a liberal democracy. This is essentially Milton Friedman vs Keynes and by now I think the debate should be over and Keynes has won. Japan and Germany are fundamentally capitalist economies, but more regulated than the US.

But Moore doesn't make this distinction clear enough. He instead just keeps criticising capitalism as a whole.",1254787200,9,1494,4.847058823529411

8378018,3,B002QW7ALW,"I actually watched this movie for a class.  I guess that makes my Amazon rental tax-deductable.  So YAY for that!  Anyway... on to my review of the film....

Michael Moore does an excellent job weaving together a narrative to explain why rampant, unprincipled capitalism is detrimental to our democracy.  The best point he makes in the film is about plutocracy.  Moore explains how the American middle class is disappearing and American society is dividing into a small collection of citizens with money and power (the 1%), and the rest of us (the 99%), who lose our homes whenever the economy takes a dump.

This should concern all Americans.  It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican.  The ""money class"" of wealthy Americans are draining the savings of the middle-class, and getting away with it, too.

This film is convincing.  It's polished and professional, and it held my attention.  I understood all of Moore's arguments.

Here's where I have problem with Moore-- he neglects the other side of the story.  Now, I've seen other work by Moore, and this is pretty consistent of him.  He's very good at presenting one side of an issue, and ignoring anything that doesn't fit into his narrative.

Here's what I mean... I believe that in this film, Moore is correctly describing unprincipled capitalism.  But he brands capitalism (as a whole) as a destructive force, and holds up socialism as a cure for greed and an economically unbalanced society.

BUT... BUT.... what Moore neglects to mention is that ANY economic system that's unprincipled, unethical, and unregulated will result in a few rich people controlling all of society's wealth.  The rest of us slobs will be laboring away in a factory while the uber-rich are kicking it on their yachts.  That can happen in a socialist economy just like in a capitalist economy if the government allows corruption and the concentration of wealth into a few hands.  And socialism is not without it's flaws.  Look around the world and there's plenty of examples of socialism gone wrong.  Italy... anyone?

Moore does a good job in this film of uncovering the ""scam"" of American capitalism and exposing how wealth was transferred from the middle-class to the banking class during the 2008 financial crisis.  But I disagree with Moore's diagnoses that the problem is capitalism on it's face.  That same scam is viable in any economic system.  The problem is a lack of ethics and principles, and no government regulation.  The US Government enabled this transfer of wealth.  That's the problem.  That can happen in any corrupt system.

Moore makes some really good points, and I think this film is worthwhile for every American to view, and it should wake people up to how political parties use social wedge issues to get the middle class to vote against their economic self-interest.  But Moore blames capitalism and holds socialism up as a cure.  I think a counter-argument is that the problem is corruption, and the cure is the enforcement of fiscal ethics through strict government oversight.  Of course that means that the middle class would have to provide oversight by voting for their own fiscal self-interest.  Which is another of Moore's points.

So my overall opinion on this movie:  It's pretty good, but debatable.",1528416000,,3285,4.950549450549451
