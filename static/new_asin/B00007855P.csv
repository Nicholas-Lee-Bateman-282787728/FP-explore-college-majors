7974404,2,B00007855P,"Based on the medical thriller by Robin Cook, this tv movie version has little of the suspense and careful plotting of its source.

Joanna Kerns stars as a recently widowed Chief of Staff whose patients are dying suddenly even though at their last physicals they were in fine shape.  Tobin Bell (the SAW movies villain) plays a brilliant research scientist who has been working with genetics and possibly an anti-aging process, but he joins the list of victims.  Gregory Harrison is the handsome financial-minded hospital administrator who falls for Kerns and Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger himself) is a shady fellow physician.  It all moves at a snail's pace and the who in the whodunit becomes obvious rather quickly.  Stick with COMA, one of the better adaptations of Cook's.",1150848000,3,778,5.046875
