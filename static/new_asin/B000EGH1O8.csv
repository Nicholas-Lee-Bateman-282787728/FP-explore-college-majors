2518544,4,B000EGH1O8,"This is a very good video that goes into great detail in covering all of the steps in building a water garden. The video continually calls it a ""water feature"", which is OK, but I have always called it a water garden for my purposes.

There is, again, much detail covered here, though I would have liked to see an overview at the beginning to help set the stage for diving right in. Th detail, though, is what really counts in these types of videos. So many that I have seen feature luscious shots of the finished product, but you almost never see anyone actually digging. Much less showing you the proper technique for getting a 300 pound rock (not as big as you would think) moved by yourself! That tip alone was worth the cost of the video in saving my back.

All in all, a very good video that I highly recommend for anyone who is thinking about doing more than just dreaming about a water garden - or just writing a check to someone else to do it.",1139702400,,952,4.254143646408839
2518545,5,B000EGH1O8,"This video is for those who really want to create a ""Professional"" Water Feature.

I have read several books on building a Water Feature for my backyard, but none seemed to be as definitive as I would have liked them to be. Most of the books I read glossed over the important ""How To"" details. And none directed me on how to achieve a really professional look and quality that I was trying to achieve.

This video ""How to Design & Build a Water Feature"" not only gave me truly ""professional tips"", but actually ""demonstrated"" the steps necessary to ensure a quality finished product.

While the video is 2 hours long, I got so involved with the building process; I watched the video straight through in one sitting. There were so many subtle hints throughout the video, I would recommend going back through each phase to thoroughly understand the many details that are presented.

The video was very effective in showing the before and after scenes. These scenes helped me to understand the importance of good design and layout before starting the project. It was interesting to see how good planning resulted in an outstanding finished product.",1139097600,,1145,4.7969543147208125
2518546,5,B000EGH1O8,"I have viewed quite a few DIY videos about landscape projects, most go just far enough to get you in trouble.  The ""How to Build a Water Feature"" DVD was a surprise.  It goes into great detail step by step and is laid out in a way that it is easy to jump from chapter to chapter to get the information you want.

Building a water feature is a big project and can easily get expensive.  This DVD truly makes the project easy.  I felt very confident after viewing it and could easily go back and find the information I wanted to review while in the middle of my project.

Build it yourself, but get this DVD, it was a great help!",1138924800,3,627,4.098360655737705
8109472,5,B000EGH1O8,This DVD shows all the steps from determining where to best locate your pond to how to landscape it after it's complete. Easy to follow instruction and explanation. Good tips on stone work and aquatic plants. Also shows how to do the plumbing. Recommended !,1336608000,,257,4.733333333333333
8109473,5,B000EGH1O8,"I am a consummate ""Do it yourself-er"" and feel confident doing most things without help.  When I considered a water feature with a pond I second guessed myself on what it would take to complete this type of project.
I am very excited and pleased with this DVD.  It gave me step by step instruction on the entire process.  The DVD built my confidence in what I can do on my own and gave me a reality check on what I will need help with on this project.
Without a doubt this DVD saved me ""time & money"" by coaching me ahead of time what I would need to look for while doing my project.  Overall this DVD is comprehensive with very creative ideas and how-to's.  Don't just slap your water feature in the middle of your yard, watch this DVD and get ideas of how to tie it into your landscape and home.  Excellent buy!!",1335657600,,814,4.185897435897436
8109474,5,B000EGH1O8,"This DVD was recommended to me by a friend and colleague who has visited my home in upstate NY.  Here I have many acres of land just begging for a water feature or two.

As a land and homeowner I have undertaken many indoor and outdoor projects.  I usually come to a quick conclusion  that I not only ill equiped, but I was also ill informed about how to competently complete a project on schedule and within budget.

Until now I had never been exposed to comprehensive instuctional DVD that REALLY explained how to get a project done.  This DVD takes us through every single step toward completeing a custom water feature of your very own.

I feel this DVD has properly prepared me to add a water feature to my home.  I feel as though I am armed with information that is realistic and will help me keep my contractor focused on the job.  I am also not feeling that sense of panic just before a project, like I am in over my head.  I feel prepared and informed!

I you like the sights and sounds of moving water, this DVD is for you.",1144108800,2,1033,4.246153846153846
8109475,4,B000EGH1O8,"This DVD ultimately delivers.  You get to see every step of how a backyard pond is built.  Having seen it done in such detail, I saw that I will never be able do it, but I would love to have these two designer/builders build one for me.  These were two honest dudes (Bill and his worker/friend), who not only really knew what they were doing, they seemed to love the subject.  I would trust them to build a pond in my backyard. One small point, it was hard to tell at first whether the ""worker"" was the homeowner, but after a while you realized, this was not the first pond he ever built.  He knew his way around a weir.  The final result was marvelous to see, and you realized how much detail went into it.  Strangely, I found the entire process very gripping and was entertained to the end, almost like an action film.  I even found myself listening attentively, as if I could fool the narrator (if he saw me) or myself, that I was actually trying to remember each step of the process, and might go to work on my pond the next morning.  I guess that showed that the presentation was so convincing that I began to believe that maybe I could do it.  Until my wife, sitting next to me, said with tongue in cheek, ""So, when are you going to build our pond?"" and I was brought right back to reality.",1142985600,,1296,4.2105263157894735
8109476,5,B000EGH1O8,"The DVD was recommended to me by a friend who knows that my yard is large enough to build a pond.  This DVD teaches every step in the process of building a pond.  In short, it is quite good.

Teaching videos can be very cheesy and almost embarrassing to watch.  Not this one.  When I first began the video, I was struck by the high production values.  The videography and editing are very professional and it maintains a crisp pace.

The video shows the complete installation of a pond in a homeowner's back yard.  It is hosted by Bill and Mark.  Bill is the ""teacher"" and Mark is the homeowner.  In reality, Mark does most of the work.  As the video progressed, I started to suspect that Mark has more experience in pond installation than the average homeowner.  This does not detract, however, from the educational value of the video.

The video starts in the back yard.  Bill gives advice on the best location to install the pond to optimize viewing from the yard as well as from different rooms in the house.  Bill also shows how the landscaping should be improved.  He runs through all the changes that should be made to the yard to make it aesthetically pleasing after the pond is installed.

Then, Bill teaches us about the different stones that can go in a pond as well as the different materials used to make the pond.  After that, Bill teaches Mark how to decide on a shape for the pond.  Then, for a long time, it's all Mark; digging holes, installing the waterfall and skimmer boxes, installing the plumbing, the pond liners, etc.  Next come the rocks, lots of them.  They look really heavy.  After the rocks come plants and stuff, the pond is done.

The completed pond is beautiful and my wife now wants to put one in our yard.  Although I now understand how a pond is created, I think that I would need some help with this project.  Mark seemed to have all the right tools and lots of tips that a novice would not normally have.

I would recommend this video for anybody who is considering adding a pond with a waterfall to their property.",1142899200,3,2053,4.436997319034853
8109477,5,B000EGH1O8,"Let's face it, most people  ~ including me ~ don't have the time or skills to build a fully functional garden waterfall, decorative pond, or do complex stonework.  I don't know about you, but I haven't a clue about the plumbing, electrical, mechanical and masony trades.  I'm not going to start learning these complex skills now.

To say I lack the craftsmanship to produce a gorgeous garden water feature is an understatement.  Like you, I need a contractor.

This wonderfully thought out, perfectly clear DVD walked me, and will walk you, too, through a detailed check list of what you and I need to know before we hand 20-, 30-, 40-grand to a landscaping designer and contractor.

In 40-odd chapters, the producers take us step-by-step through every phase of planning and building a water feature.  We can use their DVD to check that our designers and contractors have included in the design and construction plan  everything essential to success.

We can also use their great DVD as a check list of construction progress, and as a final punch list before we sign off on completion, hand over final payment and have the contractor ride off into the sunset leaving us with a dry hole in our tornup garden.

Further, I STRONGLY recommend that landscape designers and contractors give a copy of this DVD to their clients to help them understand the process and products they are paying top dollar for.  An educated client is a better client, and is likely to spend more money to get the benefits of better work.

One shortcoming of this DVD is that it doesn't contain enough information on how to maintain the garden water feature after it's designed, built and paid for.  I don't know about you, but after I spend all that money, I'm gonna want to protect and enhance my investment.

Finally, if you want proof that these guys have the credibility to produce and distribute their comprehensive DVD, visit their website ~ [...] ~ to see more samples of their work.  It's terrific!",1141862400,2,1980,4.745614035087719
8109478,5,B000EGH1O8,Better and any book on the subject because these guys not only tell you how that SHOW you how to build a water feature like the pros do.,1141689600,2,136,3.892857142857143
8109479,5,B000EGH1O8,"Wow, I have watched many ""how-to"" videos on water gardens, and I think that this video tops them all.  I really like how it's not trying to push a special product it focused on teaching you how to build an outstanding water feature. Especially the way this video goes into a lot of detail. For example, the way that you normaly would not think of the small water falls off to the side, how to pick perfect rocks, placment of the pond, lighting, and even plant everything you could possibly imagine.  Along with the extra steps to take to make your pond over the top. I have built many ponds that have been great, but now with what I have watched in this video, my ponds will be over the top.

Thanks",1141603200,,699,4.28030303030303

The video demonstrates how to incorporate your own design ideas into the overall landscape architecture of you home and garden.

Topics covered are concise and clear. Each topic is covered comprehensively so you can watch the video from start to finish or pick it up at any point without losing the instructional value.

8109481,5,B000EGH1O8,"I've been looking in to building a waterfall for years.  Hiring an expert to build one was out of our budget. Reading books on the subject and trying to get advice from mega home improvement store ""experts"" has been futile.  This thorough DVD gives you ideas and walks you through all the important stages in construction that you could never get or remember during the heat of construction.",1140825600,,391,4.735294117647059
