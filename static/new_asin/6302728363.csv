Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, Leon Ames, Rosemary DeCamp, Billy Gray and Mary Wickes.  Everything is still the same.  Same house.  The front door window has been fixed.  Gordon MacRae will be coming home from the war soon.  Doris thinks she is going to get married to him as soon as he is back in town, but what she does not realize is that the war has given Gordon a much more mature look at life.
  The cute romance is still there, but will these two ever get married?
  Look quick for a young Merv Griffin at the ice-skating pond.",1083888000,4,795,5.346774193548387
506258,5,6302728363,Marjorie Winfield (Doris Day) and William Sherman (Gordon MacRae) are back Bill has just gotten back from the war and Chester Finley (Russel Arms) Wesley's (Billy Gray) 's Piano Teacher has been dating Marjorie! Well when Marj and Bill are going to a big dance Bill shocks Marj by saying that he is going to wait a few years for the marriage so he can afford their Nest Egg without going into debt! Well They get into a big fight and Marj takes the car and leaves! Well they get over their fight and have a lot of fun with Wesley causing his usual problems! This movie ends with the whole family skating on the ice rink singing By The Light Of The Silvery Moon!,1083024000,5,661,4.296
506259,5,6302728363,"Though I loved the first movie ""On Moonlight Bay,""  I have to admit that I loved this sequel even more.  Gordon MacRae looks awfully handsome and his gorgeous voice just makes you fall in love with him.  Doris Day looks even prettier than in the first movie with her blond hair all done up. There's so much chemistry between MacRae and Day that their romance bursts with believability.
The musical numbers are adorable and fun, you literally feel like you've stepped right into their world and become part of the Winfield clan. Like the first movie, though, once you get to the end, you'll be sorry it's over!  Highly recommended!",1069977600,18,630,4.7
506260,4,6302728363,"THIS IS PURE CLEAN FUN, IT IS CUTE AND DORIS DAY AND GORDON MACRAE MAKE A CUTE PAIR. IT IS A GREAT FAMILY FILM THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD. WORTH OWNING.",1014595200,15,150,3.870967741935484
506261,3,6302728363,"My kids and I loved the original ""On Moonlight Bay"" so we thought that we would give this a try. It is not as good as the first - although it does have it's redeeming points - thanks to Wesley and Gregory ! The music is so-so, also not as good as the first.",1009756800,3,257,3.7777777777777777
506262,4,6302728363,"In the annual Quigley Poll of the top ten box-office attractions in America conducted at the end of 1952, Doris Day was determined to be the top money-making female star in films. ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"", released in 1953, was her first film release after achieving that honor. ""Moon"" was a deserved success and certainly worthy of Day's position within the industry at that time.
""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"" is the tuneful follow-up to the very popular 1951 hit for Warner Brothers, ""On Moonlight Bay"". Like its predecessor, it recalls another time and place in America, directly after World War I, bathing it in a nostalgic warmth and glow in stunning technicolor and reassembling most of the cast from the earlier film.
The characters and story are very loosely based on the ""Penrod"" series of stories written by Booth Tarkington.
Marjorie and Bill, the sweethearts of the piece, are played by Doris Day and Gordon MacRae, in their 5th and final on-screen pairing. They harmonize beautifully and play their scenes with genuine and totally unaffected warmth and believability. Watching Day, it's easy to see why see held the lofty position within the industry that she held for so long. Her natural likeability and never cloying manner are soothing and when she sings, as she does frequently, one is transported to a safe and comfortable haven.
The songs include the title tune, ""If You Were the Only Girl in the World"" and ""Ain't We Got Fun"" to name but a few.
The remaining members of Marjorie's family are back from the earlier effort and seem to be more a family than ever before.  Leon Ames is part bluster/part patriarch, while Rosemary DeCamp, as usual, is better than much of the material Hollywood generally gave her to work with.  Billy Gray is appropriately rowdy but skillfully avoiding the obnoxious elements as Wesley and Mary Wickes, as she is prone to do, shines in every scene she plays, a natural treasure as one of the most unique character actresses in film history.
If you look quickly in the beautifully staged skating sequence near the film's conclusion, you'll spot Merv Griffin talking through a megaphone and urging everyone to skate with their sweetheart. Doris Day was responsible for getting Griffin a contract at Warners, which launched his career.  In 1970, she made her first ever talk show appearance on his program.
""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"" is as substantial as a Hallmark Card brought to life but thanks to a fine cast headed by Day, who smoothly mixes the various facets of her character, some great tunes, a lightweight plot that never gets in the way of the music and some fine Warner Brothers production values, it works.
By the final credits you care so much about these characters that you almost wish Warner Brothers had done one more chapter to the story. The light in this moon certainly becomes everyone involved.",1009324800,44,2888,4.818548387096774
506263,5,6302728363,"This was a great movie!  Our whole family enjoyed watching it.  The antics of Doris's little brother were hilarious!  The scene where she fixes the car on their way home from a dance, and her fiance takes credit for it was  priceless.  I liked the story because it accurately portrayed the everyday  trials and tribulations of each of the characters, i.e., the mother,  father, daughter, son, beau, boyfriend...even the housekeeper. In spite of  all the miscommunications, misunderstandings, anger, etc., forgivness  reigns, and love wins out.  If you like traditional values and comedy,  you'll love this movie.",919468800,13,612,5.270833333333333

506572,5,6302728363,What a pleasure to see and hear Doris Day singing with Gordon McRae.  Two great singers and actors team up for a heart warming film that takes place in small town America after World War I.  Day and McRae who are engaged to be married serenade us with great songs while the movie is held together by a hilarious suspected affair between Day's father and a French actress.  Nothing but great family fun in this movie.  You'll be able to watch this one over and over again and never get tired of the acting or the music.,1402012800,3,518,4.309278350515464

506680,5,6302728363,"It's a family movie filled with fun; and a musical score you can't help but sing along with. I have always loved By the Light of the Silvery Moon; based loosely on the Penrod stories by Booth Tarkington. The songs and overall feel, give the viewer 101 minutes of days gone by; and escape from the headlines of today. I know there are those who prefer its predecessor ""On Moonlight Bay"", but not our house.
When growing up this was always shown over Thanksgiving weekend; it was a wonderful way to kick off the Christmas season.
By the Light of the Silvery Moon; doesn't have a deep plot; or scenes of intrigue unless you count whether or not Wesley will deliver the banks letter to Miss Renee LaRue and if Fearless Flanagan will track down Dangerous Dora and the bank crooks. Then theres Marjorie and Bill, will they see through the confusion surrounding the banks rental of the local Opera House clearing the way for them to finally get married. And last but by no means least, Mary Wicks as Stella the families Housekeeper who does her best to keep them all in line.
With Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, Mary Wicks and a musical score by Gus Edwards and Max Steiner, Moon is simply one of the best Feel good movies from the 1950s available on DVD. I highly recommend it everyone this holiday season.",1383523200,5,1295,4.514893617021277

I play it often just to enjoy the fun songs in the movie.  Of course, I'm a pushover for both these amazing actors/singers!  Also, Wesley, the younger brother, is played adoringly by Billy Gray.

506744,5,6302728363,"The star of this sequel is Billy Gray as Wesley Winfield (badge 79).  ""I'm never going to be a father, I hate fathers!""  His way of dealing with obstacles is alarming and fun.  And thank goodness, they also beefed up Mary Wickes' role as Stella, giving her more to do and say (no one does `snide' quite like she could).  Rosemary DeCamp is back as the patient and loving mother, Alice Winfield.  She's perfectly paired with Leon Ames as George Winfield, who manages to get himself mixed up with a visiting actress (through no fault of his own!).  Doris Day and Gordon MacRae return as the lovelorn pair who can't decide when to get married (or if to get married).  It's a bit drippy and contrived and makes for some pouting, followed by a full-fledged musical number done on a stage (King Chanticleer).  Otherwise, it's more of the same with these two.  She goes back to being a tomboy for awhile (instead of sports, this time she's a car mechanic).  He starts spouting drivel again (supposedly radical ideas for that time).  When they sing the same problem arises, songs are left half finished, interrupted, never completed.  It makes one wonder why they bothered including any songs in the first place.  And, their poor father (Leon Ames) is once again embroiled in a great misunderstanding.  Last time he was a drunken wife beater, this time he's a philandering husband.  It's as though they thought the only way to do a sequel was to repeat the same things that made the first movie good.  For me, it wasn't quite as wonderful as On Moonlight Bay.

506847,5,6302728363,"Not to be missed, this is an almost forgotten, but excellent piece of heart-warming Americana in stunning technicolor.  Who says only MGM could produce works like this?  Warner Brothers never produced a better musical of this genre.  Wonderful selection of nostalgic songs, authentic sets, and fitting performances by Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, Leon Ames and Rosemary DeCamp.  Day and MacRae are at the top of their game, and watching this film is the only way you will ever be able to hear them sing together (no recordings were ever made available to the public, probably because of conflicting recording contracts) -- so don't miss this for several reasons.  Billy Gray (""Bud"" of ""Father Knows Best"") gives a delightful performance, as well.  Leon Ames could have stepped right off the set of ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" or ""Life With Father"" and couldn't be more perfect.  Hard to believe that this was filmed some 60 years ago.  Note that Warner Brothers based the script on some of Booth Tarkington's ""Penrod"" stories, lending even more authenticity to its roots.  And, given that this was filmed a mere 35 years after the time of it's setting, you can observe the use of a lot of authentic props (telephones, victrolas, kitchen appliances, furnishings, etc.)  There's plenty here to enjoy, so gather all the family (except teenagers, perhaps) and ENJOY!",1306713600,,1354,4.977777777777778
506848,5,6302728363,"""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"" is truly a gem for the whole family!  Everyone is perfect in their parts and all the family problems are believable.  Whoever at Warner Brothers decided to put Gordon MacRae and Doris Day in movies together was really brilliant.  Their singing blended together beautifully and they seemed to have a good time working together!  If you want to be blessed with the singing and camaraderie, don't miss the pleasure you'll feel seeing this movie!!",1305417600,,478,4.864197530864198

506850,4,6302728363,"I bought this movie because I loved it when I was a kid.  I was sick of all the cold weather and snow and went on line to look specifically for this DVD.  I wasn't disappointed.  It's a great nostalgic type of movie with Doris Day as a tom boy and Gordon McRae as her love interest.  On their first date, Gordon's car breaks down and Doris fixes it!! He has some very strange ideas of marriage and he is attending college.  Her father assumes he is dating her and will marry her.  When he finds out that Gordon is not interested in Marriage, he is furious and tells Doris she cannot see him any more. Her parents are typical of its time period and the house keeper/cook is really part of the family.  Her brother is played by the boy from the TV show Father Knows Best.  Of course he gets into trouble and every time he is about to get punished by the father, someone comes along and reminds the father that he used to do the same kind of things.  It's a fun-loving kind of movie of yester year. No violence.  It also has a sequal called On Moonlite Bay. I bought both. Both movies are really cute.  Each movie has some singing in it, but not as much as a typical musical. Doris Day and Gordon McRae both have great voices.  As I said, it reminded me of happier times and I enjoyed watching it.  If you are into nostalgia, I think you will like it, too.  Can't beat the price.",1296518400,3,1376,4.143396226415095

I recommend this movie ""hands-down""...particularly during the Holidays!

506946,5,6302728363,"I love this film and the first of the two films On Moonlight Bay (1951) with one of my favourite actresses and singers Doris Day.

I remember as a child watching this and loving every minute of it. I am now 42 years old and was not even born when it was released but have seen it on TV many times and have copies of them on Video. My Mum got me into Doris Day with her music and films but this and its sequel are my favourites of hers and Mum's to.

It is a true family musical film about childhood, growing up, life in the early 19th Century USA and World War 2 and beyond.

I ordered my copy and the first film from Amazon USA as I could not wait for it to become available on Region 2 DVD. I can now at last retire my old worn out VHS Tapes and watch them on my DVD Player.",1180396800,,776,3.8074534161490683

506953,5,6302728363,"By The Light of the Silvery Moon is the sequel to On Moonlight Bay, and virtually as good.  Both movies are an effective blend of comedy, music, and nostalgia.  All the same characters are here, Doris Day as Marjorie Winfield, Leon Ames and Rosemary De Camp as her parents, Billy Gray her little brother Wesley -- the character based on Penrod Schofield of Booth Tarkington's books -- Mary Wickes as the cook, and of course Gordon MacRae as her fiancee just returned from fighting World War One.

This one involves Wesley in a scheme to rescue their thanksgiving turkey by substituting one stolen from his father's boss, and Wesley delivering what appears to be a love letter to an actress he imagines is some sort of spy trying to seduce his father.

Outstanding among the musical numbers is Gordon MacRae's rendition of ""Not My Girl,"" with a song & dance performance almost comparable to  Gene Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain.""  Of course MacRae's dancing isn't as perfect as Kelly's, but here he makes an impressive effort.  There's also an entertaining ice-skating finale.

In terms of comedy and music, I think this one is not quite as good as On Moonlight Bay, but it looks like they spent more on production, so overall it's virtually as good.  If the first movie's a '10' then this one's a '9.9' so they both get five stars here.",1118966400,7,1334,4.666666666666667
506954,5,6302728363,"Following the huge box office success of ON MOONLIGHT BAY, plans were immediately made for a sequel, reuniting all the key cast members and using the continuing 'Penrod' stories as the plotline.

Marjorie (Doris Day) is eagerly awaiting the return of Bill Sherman (Gordon MacRae) following the end of WWI, though their romance seems to have cooled.  Bill now partially regrets proposing so hurridly and now wants to wait until his financial situation is more stable.

All kinds of funny subplots occur throughout the film, the highlight being Wesley (Billy Gray) thinking his father (Leon Ames) is having an affair with a visiting French movie star (Maria Palmer)!  Also on hand are Rosemary DeCamp as the patient mother, and Mary Wickes as wisecracking housekeeper Stella.

Doris Day and Gordon MacRae sing the Title Song and  ""Ain't We Got Fun?"", whilst Day has a ball with the rousing ""King Chanticleer"".
