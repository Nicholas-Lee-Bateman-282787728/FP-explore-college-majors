2707558,5,B000LE16WG,"I normally do not ""review"" DVD's purchased, but I couldn't resist on for Max & Ruby's Easter....I read the other reviews that characterized this 2007 as a major disappointment because of the change in Ruby's voice, yada, yada, yada....

I completely disagree - my almost 4 year old who continues to enjoy Max and Ruby didn't even notice and has been glued to each episode of the entire DVD.  If you have a Max & Ruby fan in your household, buy this!  It's great to finally have new story lines for my preschooler to watch - and for me to listen to!",1174953600,16,548,4.352941176470588
2707559,1,B000LE16WG,"Forget about the voices, they out and out changed the Max and Ruby characters.  We are also a loyal Max and Ruby family, but this DVD is a major disappointment.  My kids hated it.",1174694400,7,179,4.235294117647059
2707560,4,B000LE16WG,"This is a cute show which always has a funny ending for learning! The only episode witch feature Ruby with a different voice was the first one on the DVD. It is not that different and didn't bother me at all, in fact it was cute! This dvd does have lots of episodes on it with the original voices, just the first one sounds a little different it's nothing that would keep me from buying it! This cartoon is so much better for children than a lot of the ones they show on cartoon network!",1174089600,11,487,4.136842105263158
2707561,1,B000LE16WG,"This was a giant disappointment! I have a 4 yr old and a 8 yr old and our whole family loves Max & Ruby.  We look forward to the new DVD's and we always make it family night when a new one comes out.  We popped this one in today and boy were we disappointed!  They've totally changed the voices on all the characters and the whole thing has a very cheap and thrown together look to it.  It's always sad when the almighty dollar take precedent over quality.  A big part of the charm of Max & Ruby is the voices and sounds and the sweet storylines.  Even the toys in these new episodes sound wrong.  If any of you has seen the previous episodes you'll know exactly what I mean.  For those of you who are new to Max & Ruby, skip this DVD and buy the ones that came out before this one!!!  Those are quality...this one it just crummy.  There are some older episodes on the ""b"" side but all of the new episodes look like they were thrown together just so they could get a DVD out before Easter.  How sad.",1173916800,19,999,4.045918367346939

2707681,4,B000LE16WG,"First off I will say I am not a big Max and Ruby fan, I feel like it is strange that their parents are never seen and Ruby does everything, with that though this is a cute DVD.  It includes 12 episodes featuring Max and Ruby, with Max always saving the day.  It is 1.5 hours of fun and mischief.  Cute show that is wholesome for young kids.  I like how Max is an outside the box thinker and always saving the day!  While these episodes have been previously aired on television, it has been nice to have them all on one DVD.

Episodes include:

Ruby's Easter Bonnet
Max's Easter Parade
Max and the Easter Bunny
Ruby's Loose Tooth
Ruby Scores!
Ruby's Sand Castle
Max's Work of Art
Max Meets Morris
Ruby's Scavenger Hunt
Max's Check-Up

2707690,5,B000LE16WG,Easter with Max & Ruby DVD features 12 great episodes of one of the most beloved animated series for kids.

The voice changes in the video are the same on television, it takes a dedicated viewer but eventually you will hear both sets of voices.  These are episodes which have aired on TV.

In the Easter set of episodes, the voices of Max and Ruby are slightly different, but I hardly noticed.  It wasn't until we watched it several times that I noticed a slight difference.  My daughter didn't notice at all.  All the episodes are super cute and we love watching them together.",1239580800,,372,4.492537313432836

My grandaughter's just love it..They have watched it almost every day since I gave it to them..even in the car.

2707708,5,B000LE16WG,"It's true that it took some adjustments to get used to the new voices of Max & Ruby, especially in the first few episodes.  I think the voice of Max stays the same except for when it was in the first story.  The last six episodes were of the original voices.  My 5 y.o. girl and 3 y.o. boy love it!!!  My son especially like the new voices of the toy robots.  He would laugh at the sounds everytime he watches it.  The new voice of Ruby grew on me, and I got used to it.  I do understand for those reviewers who love the original voices.  Roger actually speaks and say a few more words than ""Uh-Huh.""  I'm not sure if this is good or bad, but my kids again think it's funny.  They would say ""Roger speaks!""  I thought the quality of the video and artwork were good and I didn't feel that this video is cheaply put together.  My family especially enjoys the ""Ruby's Easter Bonnet, Ruby's Scores, and Max Meets Morris stories.""  Oh, the story about the Beach is good too.  Anyways, we're glad that more Max & Ruby videos are coming out, because I especially am tired of watching the same old ones.",1178323200,6,1095,4.201923076923077
