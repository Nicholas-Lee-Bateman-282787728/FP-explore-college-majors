8200879,5,B000RIWB1Q,"I found a Region 0 copy of this in an Orlando record store. This is the complete Buenos Aires show from 1992. The source is PRO #1a. If you know what that means, then you will know what to expect and you will be very happy to have a professionally-pressed DVD of this source. If you have no idea what I am talking about, then you will probably end up complaining about the quality.",1481932800,2,381,4.162162162162162

8200883,1,B000RIWB1Q,This was a very boaring movie. It was very difficult to get into it and I got to a point where I had to just turn it off,1398643200,,120,3.3214285714285716

8200886,1,B000RIWB1Q,"I agree this movie sucked. Was hoping for something great for my husband and I to watch. Very disappointed. Looks like an amateur made the movie, and the actors were completely unbelievable. Just a horribly, bad, crappy, can't say enough negative about this movie. I could have made a better one myself.",1332547200,4,303,4.846153846153846
8200887,1,B000RIWB1Q,"while i never expected Caligula, the description led me to believe some (simulated) sex would be taking place; i kept waiting, and waiting, but it never came (ALL puns intended). that might not have been the death blow, except the movie makes NO SENSE AT ALL, without any naked people, and dry humpin'.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! really, you would be better off picking your nose, while jerking off, to your grandmother's old Sears catalogues. seriously--i'm considering suicide, because i am not forgetting this nightmare quickly enough.",1312934400,36,536,5.090909090909091
