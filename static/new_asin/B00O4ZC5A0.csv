6710997,3,B00O4ZC5A0,"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No-Good, Very Bad Day is probably one of the most well-known children's books. I remember it fondly from my childhood and was pretty excited when I found out they were making it into a movie.

What I remember of the children's book is that it centers around Alexander, a child who is having THE WORST day, and a running theme where bad things continually happen and Alexander states that he wants to move to Australia. At the end of the book, his mom tells Alexander that everyone has bad days, even in Australia.

This movie has a relatively simple plot too, while ramping up the goofiness that seems to be required in family movies. Alexander has a terrible day while the rest of his family seems to have everything going for them.  Alexander feels that he is always having bad days and no one knows what it feels like, so he makes himself a birthday sundae and wishes that everyone else would know what it feels like to have a terrible day. His wish comes true the next day when his family all have horrible days with trouble and hijinks popping up everywhere. Ultimately everything comes together as you would expect in a feel-good family film.

The movie was cute and nicely tied in many bad things that happened to Alexander during the book, while adding many new problems or issues that happen to his family on THEIR bad day. Although Alexander doesn't continually wish to move to Australia in the movie, he IS obsessed with Australia and the outback, which is a nice nod to the book.  While the movie starts off showing Alexander's horrible day, most of the film detailed his family's bad day, after Alexander's birthday wish comes true. This was a relatively short film (about an hour and twenty minutes), which was refreshing to me. I feel like movies are becoming longer and longer lately, many of them unnecessarily so. For a family flick, I thought the length was just right to keep the attention of the younger audience. It didn't drag on and had enough action throughout to keep little ones engaged. Even the ""lesson"" and resolution of the problems was handled in a way that was still entertaining and fast-paced.

The movie was obviously cheesy at times and pretty unrealistic. All sorts of things happened that left me rolling my eyes and thinking, ""Oh, how convenient.."" and ""Of COURSE that would happen right then..""  However, for a family film, I thought it was cute, enjoyable, and funny. There were a lot of parts that I found humorous as an adult, and even more parts that kids were cracking up at. A cute adaptation of a great children's book.",1413676800,13,2605,4.662309368191721

6710999,4,B00O4ZC5A0,"The full name is ""Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"" but I doubt if that will fit on very many marquees.

Based on Judith Viorst's classic book by the same name, we see a wonderful cast bring these beloved characters to life:
  * Ed Oxenbould (""Julian"") is our hero Alexander, caught up in his own misery, but eventually he realizes having gum stuck in his hair isn't the worst thing that's happened, he soon notices that he isn't the only one having a bad day...
  * Dylan Minnette (""Prisoners"") is his brother Anthony Cooper, who... well... you'll have to see it. (They call him Wreck-it Ralph at school.) Small hint, he has a driver's test today.
  * Kerris Dorsey (Lots of TV) His sister Emily Cooper is scheduled to play Tinkerbell in the school production of Peter Pan today, but she woke up with a bad cold!
  * Jennifer Garner (""Draft Day"") is Kelly Cooper, his mother. You should see the typo in the children's book she is publishing!
  * Steve Carell (""The Way, Way Back"") is his dad Ben Cooper, who has cheerfully kept the home fires burning since he was downsized, but he has a job interview...and a baby to tend...and a birthday cake to bake... and a son in trouble at school...and a daughter in a play...and his wife may have lost her job.
  * Dick Van Dyke (""Night at the Museum"") makes us smile when he shows up ready and willing to read a brand new book to an eager audience... Oops!
  * Megan Mullally (Lots of TV) is Nina, the demanding dame in charge of the publishing house where Kelly works.
  * Jennifer Coolidge (""Austenland"") is the driver's license examiner. In my opinion, I think that's a dirty trick that she pulls on Anthony.
  * ...and then there's the alligator....

Well, you'd have to be there. We were in a theater full of little 'uns and not a peep was heard. There is enough silly mayhem on screen to keep them occupied and the adults laugh, too! (I like it when they kick the garbage cans.)

It's Disney, so the Super Coopers MUST prevail and a happy ending is enjoyed by all.",1413244800,,2040,4.444743935309973
6711000,4,B00O4ZC5A0,"Just when you think nothing else could go wrong, it does. (""It's never too late to screw up"" - word to live by.)

This amusing farce paces itself like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Alone/dp/B0031QNMKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Alone</a>&nbsp;- just one goofy mishap after another (mostly preventable, of course). Although more up to date, a lot of the humor will look familiar to fans of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stooges/dp/B006WN5W5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stooges</a>. I guess that ""thank gawd it's not happening to me"" feeling is timeless.

Then, it winds up on a happy note, all things working out well in the end, one big happy family.
This seemed a bit thin to me, considering the ordeals ahead of Anthony and Emily, but what's behind those curtains can stay there.

6711047,4,B00O4ZC5A0,"When something fresh and successful comes along, everyone wants a piece of it. Shortly following the films release, a number of copycats emerge and to be honest most of them are terrible. Maybe it's because we tend to compare it to the original or maybe it's because the scripts are rushed and just aren't that good. In any case, after the release of the Wimpy Kid series, we saw a lot of these family comedies, centering on the not so popular kids, and as expected, most of them were awful, with one notable exception. Alexander's bad day focuses on a young man whose birthday coincides with his first day of middle school, which doesn't go so well. After receiving no sympathy from his family, Alexander wishes that they all had their own bad day, and the results were hilarious. This isn't the typical PG family comedy you see from Disney, as it was quite raunchy for them and really pushes the boundary of that PG rating. Ed Oxenbould stars as Alexander and fits the role like a glove. Oxenbould looks and sounds kind of awkward, after all it is a strange age, but watching him gave the feeling that he's not all that unfamiliar with being unpopular. Possibly playing on real life experience, he rivals Alex Gordon with a performance that was not only believable, but it was also very funny. Another advantage this film has over the Wimpy Kid series is that the young cast has help from some of Hollywood's elite, as co-stars include Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner. The pair give a lot of support and the producers use them to break-up the middle school monotony that would has surely ensued. While not my usual genre, I loved the Wimpy kid series, but Alexander's bad day is more than an adequate alternative for those who are looking for something a little bit different.",1495238400,,1779,4.632911392405063

6711318,3,B00O4ZC5A0,This is not the best Disney movie I have ever seen. I think the price of this production should be dropped to seven dollars. The Walt Disney company has made better. Even if it did cost a lot of money to make I think the value is there. So please either rent the movie for around five dollars or wait till the movie drops to seven dollars before purchasing. I bought the movie because Ed Oxenbould was in it. I hope that he gets better scripts if he continues on being in movies. If you want to see a good movie with Ed Oxenbould then see Paper Planes. A great movie about making paper planes that fly.,1447372800,,602,4.153846153846154

It took me a while, but I must say it wasn't worth it at all. I didn't like it. The kids didn't like it. We kept watching hoping it would get funnier as the story went on, but it never did. Often the ending will redeem a movie; this one didn't. Predictably Disney -- ruining a perfectly good story.

Second, it demonstrates staying home and raising children is not entirely a woman's domain and going out, providing for the family is not entirely a man's domain.

6711376,4,B00O4ZC5A0,"Ever have a day so bad you wished that others shared your misfortune?  Well that's the problem little 11-year old Ed Oxenbould faces.  He has a terrible, horrible no good very bad day.  He trips and falls while getting out of bed, he gets picked on by his older brother and sister, he accidentally sets his school lab on fire while talking to/fantasizing about a girl he likes, he finds himself unable to cope with the fact that another person in his school is having a party even bigger than the one Ed's family planned for his birthday so his entire school is going to that party instead, and so on.  So what does he do?  He makes a wish the night before his birthday that his entire family has a bad day like the he just went through.

The next day comes and... uh oh!  His sister wakes up with a head cold making it difficult to think clearly and perform Peter Pan at her school play which results in a lot of cough syrup throughout the day!  The older brother develops a huge zit on his forehead on prom day making it challenging to ask an unappreciative high and mighty girl out to a date (and later fails a driving test in crazy fashion!)  Steve Carell (the father) has his hands full with the kids (especially the little baby who likes to decorate his lips with green magic marker) while attending a job interview  in the hopes of becoming a video gamer designer.  The mother (Jennifer Garner) has car trouble and her own issues that result in constantly rushing around and not thinking clearly (especially notable is the segment where a children's book she wrote got the word ""jump"" mixed up with ""dump"" which results in a hilarious and inappropriate mistake revealed in front of a group of children) .  And I'm only describing the tip of the iceberg!

Nothing but one problem after another for the entire family... except Ed Oxenbauld, who sits back and regretfully absorbs all the things that his family goes through knowing he's responsible.  That's what I call a terrible, horrible no good very day bad!  There's even MORE horrible things this family goes through, but I don't want to spoil every single one of them.  At least know Ed's obsession with Australia has a really good payoff at the end.  Let's just leave it at that.  I guess the biggest complaint is that the movie is basically one outrageous fast-moving segment directly into another without any breathing room, but I think the pace works wonderfully.  Plus there's a fair amount of comedy by all the characters since they all get an equal amount of attention.  One thing's for sure- I don't need to have a family of my own to realize there's a little bit of truth to this movie.  When you have four kids and a mother and father always on the go, several problems are bound to develop along the way and hurrying up is a constant thing.  I wouldn't be able to handle this kind of lifestyle.

I really wanted to give this movie 5 stars because it excels in all major categories.  It's constantly exciting with a zany edge, the writing is sharp and outrageous around every corner, and the characters are all really memorable.  For a kids movie this is really awesome.  However it's only 75 minutes long which makes it incredibly short.  Now for the entire 75 minutes there's never a dull moment, but I still feel the movie's too short overall and needed more content.  I highly recommend this movie though!  Even adults can enjoy it.",1438732800,,3407,4.530278232405892

6711388,5,B00O4ZC5A0,"This movie was hilarious, but it should have been rated PG13, in my opinion. I would not have taken my kids 9 and 7 to it had I known all the inappropriate humor that would be in it. I'm giving it 5 stars, because it is a great movie. It's funny, heart warming, and just fun. Just understand there are several things in the movie you might not want your little ones to see. In one part, a classmate/ fellow carpooler puts Alexander's face on the bodies of scantily clad women and sends it to everyone at school. Another boy then tells Alexander, ""Nice boobs."" The word butt thong is mentioned. Photos of women (with Alexander's face) in string bikinis with big boobs flash across the screen several times. There's another scene where the 13 year old girl gets drunk on cough syrup and makes a fool of herself and then vomits. In another scene the mother yells out that she's seen everyone's penis in the van. In another scene, the teenage boy tells his girlfriend that he likes that cute little butt of hers. It was all just stuff I felt was inappropriate for children. I personally loved the movie and am recommending it to my adult friends. I just don't think it's suitable for the younger crowd.",1437609600,,1198,4.474885844748859

6711425,5,B00O4ZC5A0,"These aimed at kids marketed films usually fall on the second side of the hit and miss scale as being enjoyable for adults as well, but this film based on a picture book, definitely is enjoyable for both adults and children to watch.  The first part reminded me of Diary of a Wimpy Kid or Malcolm's unfair life hurdles from Malcolm in the Middle.  Basically everything in Alexander's life is going wrong, when it comes to impressing the girl he has a crush on, getting to do an assignment on his desired topic, to being blatantly embarrassed by a photo bomb prank that went out to everyone in his school, he's not happy, and to make matters worse it seems no one will be coming to his birthday as a richer more popular kid has decided to have his party on the same night. Everything else in the lives of his other family members seems to be perfect.  So Alexander makes a birthday wish to basic cure his other family members to have the sort of day he's having.

The rest of the film is that day playing out.  Unlike say Diary of a Wimpy Kid this film also tells the story from each of the parent's points of view, in fact they both have a number of locations where Alexander isn't even around.  His brother and sister also have their own storylines too.  There's also a baby but he's obviously with other characters all the time.  Steve Carrell makes a very believable father, often in these younger character driven plots, the parents, especially the father doesn't always come across as believable.  He kind of reminded me of  Phil Dunphy from Modern Family, if you like that show you'll love this movie.

Jennifer Garner looked a bit young to have a teenage son old enough to drive, but perhaps she is in real life old enough and I'm just used to seeing her play much younger characters.  She still does a decent job and she does have to tackle being the most morally unlikeable at times character of the family, such as pressuring her son to overtake a truck into on coming traffic that he's not comfortable with, just because she slept in and doesn't want to be late for work. As well as simply bailing on the company she works for during a crisis at one stage (in real life I imagine she would have been fired).  In fact all the characters do make decisions that they probably wouldn't in real life, such as taking a baby to a job interview, when he should have just left him with the teenage son to look after, that gets them into some of these situations but you expect that from this sort of film, where no one is really taking the situations too seriously.

A very fun film, where the actions and jokes never stop, which is pretty rare these days.",1434844800,,2658,4.3979591836734695
6711426,5,B00O4ZC5A0,This was a very fun movie to watch with the family. Shows how everything can go well even in the toughest of times just by being together. But that family sure is very unlucky.,1434758400,,176,4.205882352941177
6711427,5,B00O4ZC5A0,"Very funny.  A whirlwind of comedy.  Great for kids, parents or people who used to be kids.",1434758400,,91,4.294117647058823
6711428,3,B00O4ZC5A0,"Alexander Cooper (Ed Oxenbould) is convinced that he is cursed to have nothing but bad days.  This morning, for example, he wakes up with gum in his hair and an invitation to a party from the most popular kid in school.  The problem?  The party is opposite his own twelfth birthday party.  Meanwhile, the rest of his family has amazing things happen to them constantly.  That night, he makes himself a birthday cake and a wish  that his family would see what it is like to have a bad day.

And boy do things do downhill quickly for the rest of them.  His older brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) wakes up to a pimple on prom day while sister Emily (Kerris Dorsey) has a cold on opening night of her class play.  The promising day his parents had also goes wrong as Ben (Steve Carell) has problems with a job interview and Kelly (Jennifer Garner) hits a major snag in a book launch at her job.  Meanwhile, Alexanders life is going right for once.  But will any of them survive the as the chaos builds?

As always when a picture book is turned into a feature film, the writers have to really expand on the premise.  Here, the similarities are there, but they could have changed a few names and made this movie without any reference to the book.  Still, there are a few nods to the book early on that fans will enjoy.

Which leaves us to look at this film on its own merits.  Its amusing at times, but I cringed at much of the embarrassment humor the film contained.  The two balanced each other out as the film progressed.

The film is fairly predictable, especially since it opens with a shot of the family near the end of the day.  Still, it is fast paced enough to keep us interested in seeing just how the family gets there.  The characters are developed just enough for us to care, although they are types weve seen before.  I did enjoy the ultimate message about the importance of family, however, and I found the acting good.

Ultimately, I think this is a film that kids will enjoy more than their parents.  Adults might find it amusing once, but they won't see a need to watch it more than that.",1434585600,,2100,4.355670103092783

6711451,2,B00O4ZC5A0,"Normally I wouldn't watch this film.  The ill-suggested title pretty much says it all.  My teenage son wanted to see it however, which itself is a head scratcher, but about 15 minutes into the film I figured out why.  A very cute actress (Bella Thorne, ""The Duff"") plays the high school sweetheart of Anthony Cooper (Dylan Minnette, ""Let Me In"") of the family having the bad day.

Every member of the Cooper family, Ben (Steve Carell), Kelly (Jennifer Garner), Alexander (Ed Oxenbould), Anthony, Emily (Kerris Dorsey) and baby Trevor (Vargas twins) have their problems.  The parents with their job, or in Ben's case, job interview after being ""downsized."" The kids have their own problems, revolving around school projects or romance.  And even Trevor has problems after losing his bumblebee pacifier, thanks to Alexander's carelessness.  And then there is Alexander's birthday.

There are a few laughs along the way, mostly from Emily and her attempt to play Peter Pan in the school play.  But there are just too many improbable, unlikely and maybe even impossible events that screws up the one day.  Or does it?  The one redeeming factor in the film is that it does show the family, for all of its screw-ups and divisions, remain committed to each other.  So while I didn't like the movie, it does send a good message that would be appropriate for many would be viewers.

While the film is problematic, the transfer to Blu ray is terrific.  Sticking with the original 2.39:1 aspect ratio, the movie is delivered with a 1080p video resolution.  Colors are strong and vibrant.  Skin tones are accurate and black levels are inky.  Detail is very good.  In short this is a beautiful, bright, nearly flawless looking film.  The disc uses a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is also very good.  Nothing particularly noteworthy, but excellent depth, easy to understand dialog and a decent soundtrack.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Extras include a 5 minute piece with the author of the children's book that inspired the film, some bloopers, a music video (""Hurricane""), a video diary, and a 7 minute short about shooting the Outback-based birthday party.",1433203200,,2183,4.9559228650137745

6711462,4,B00O4ZC5A0,"Any time a beloved book gets turned into a film, especially a book that is relatively short on material to suggest it could even be a film, I find myself wondering why there's a need for it.  However, Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day ends up being good fun for the whole family to enjoy.  Casting was brilliant to bring in the likes of Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner who both play to type more or less and manage to be great parents as well as hilariously inept ones at the same time.  Ed Oxenbould as Alexander, though, is the true star and rightly so.  The writers have kept the main character of Judith Viorst's book at the heart of the film's story and found someone who manages with the struggles boldly while still being just a kid.  There are plenty of moments of whimsy but there's a sense of balance, too, even when things take an obvious turn for the worse.  In the end, the Alexander's day may not be perfect for him or his family, but at least they've got each other and what a ride it is to the end of it at a crisp 80 minutes",1432512000,,1068,4.21078431372549

I love the book from which this was created and was hoping for ""more"".  The movie is basically ""okay"".  There were some great funny parts now and then and a lot of adult humor some of which I would not want to explain to kids and some of which I just didn't care to see.

6711553,2,B00O4ZC5A0,"I guess each family is different.  We did not like this.  And quite a few of our acquaintenaces found this movie offensive.

This is a funny movie but the subject, jokes and language crossed the lines on many fronts on what we would consider acceptable for our Kids. To be honest even as Adults we found the humor in bad taste. We don't find anything funny or normal in a movie where the comedy revolves around pictures of Kids in bikini, references to genitalia, striptease and making out in the back seat of a car.  And certainly we did not expect this in a Kids movie made by Disney.  Not that we have high hopes from Disney but we did not expect this.

We are not naive and don't buy that Disney is all about family values.  It might have been true during the days of Walter Disney.  But the Disney today is no different than any other corporate that values its cash register more than family values.

Can't we find anything funny today unless it borders on a sexual theme? Jokes & wise cracks are meant to be funny and so are sexual jokes.  But when all jokes and laughs are based on sex it gets too repetitive and annoying and after sometime it is no longer funny. You find it offensive and repulsive to even be around such folks who find this entertaining.

And no matter how much patience you have with such sexual & potty humor we don't think it has a place in a Kids movie.

We made the mistake of watching this movie with the Kids without checking it first. We went by the glowing reviews from folks who claimed this was a great family movie and ofcourse this was a Disney film.  We did not expect some of this crude humor from a Disney film. And from the 5 star reviews I can only guess that families have begun to accept and tolerate anything that Disney and Hollywood feeds them in the name of entertainment.  This maybe an ideal family and lifestyle from the perspective of a Hollywood or Disney film executive.  But this is not an acceptable lifestyle in the society I was raised and grew up in.

Our kids could not even relate to some of the jokes and found it odd & offensive. This was not a movie they enjoyed as some of this langauage and behaviour is not the norm in our family for Kids and Adults. The film was instantly forgotten unlike other Kid films they want to watch again and again.  Thankfully we rented this and did not purchase this movie.  I guess the Disney stamp on films does not mean the same thing any more as Disney has adopted the Hollywood standard where comedy has to be crude with sexual references.

This is not a Kids movie. It is a movie for older teenagers and adults.  Nothing new and special to make this standout among the hundreds of crude comedies from Hollywood you can see once and forget.",1430352000,,2743,4.330724070450098

My 9 yr old loved the commercials for this and I had heard it did not do great at the box office but thought it might be a fun family movie with at least some funny scenes.  Not one of us laughed at all.  My kids enjoy most movies and this was nothing they were interested in watching ever again.  It was not even close to the book.  Very disappointing.,1428624000,,399,4.0

Truly, I didn't expect to love the movie. I'd seen the trailers and was ready to shred on how it was a poor imitation. Except that it's not an imitation. And it's pretty fantastic. It borrows from the book, without being beholden to it and it added a twist of perspective to the story in a way that paid homage to the book. Everyone in the family laughed and everyone loved it--it's family-friendly AND it celebrates the special quirkiness and genuine love for each other that the luckiest of families have, even on their worst days.",1428019200,,810,4.5479452054794525

6711857,5,B00O4ZC5A0,"As you know, the movie known as Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day came to blu-ray in early February! This is an absolutely hysterical movie that I think is great for the whole family to watch together! While younger audiences may not understand all of the humor in it, it's still a really good and clean fun movie made for kids and adults alike. My husband and I watched it before our kids did. We laughed through most of it when we watched it the first day that I received it in the mail.

Alexander is the typical kid who has bad luck like some of us do at times, but he wished that his family could experience the extent of his bad day like he did, so he was not alone! Well, sure enough his wish came true and his family the next day had the worst day ever, especially his mom who was helping publish a book for a famous author and it worded incorrectly in the print out that the author received and he started to read it out loud to a big group of small children, and she was trying to warn him that was the wrong printed book and to stop reading it. Needless to say, no one was happy with her at all after that!",1426982400,3,1143,4.08

6711928,2,B00O4ZC5A0,"I was really looking forward to purchasing this movie, but I decided to rent it first with my son who's 8 years old. The movie wasn't exactly like the book. I mean even eventful things like gum getting stuck in his hair or a trip to the shoe store were no where to be seen. However, what really made me dislike the movie is the fact that the word ""penis"" was used not once but TWICE! Sometimes when I do an author study with my class, I like to show the movie as a culminating activity to end the unit. I was extremely happy that I watched this first, before letting a class view this. Generally I always watch the movie before I show it to a class, but when it's based on a children's book I assume the material would be appropriate. So this is why I give the two stars. Even my son, who loves to watch movies over and over again, said it was terrible.",1426377600,,853,4.083333333333333

6711933,5,B00O4ZC5A0,"Somehow this movie slipped under my radar when it was released at the theater, so much so that I didn't even recognize the title. When my son showed up with this from the Red Box, I was thinking, ""What is this garbage? Some direct to DVD animated silliness?"" I sat down to watch it with him, and was delightfully surprised. This movie is really, really funny (and I typically prefer the hard R stuff like ""Horrible Bosses"" and ""Team America""), and I was thrilled to see such big roles from some great actors, like Steve Carell. There is some stuff in here that will definitely embarrass and possibly enrage more squeamish or conservative parents, but all things considered (this is the age of the internet, people! Your kids have already seen horrible, horrible things!), this movie is pretty tame. Personally, I thought Dick Van Dyke's profanity in a book shop full of little kids and parents was classic stuff in the making. Ultimately, this is a Disney movie, so we have the requisite amount of sentimental, tear-jerking, manipulative plot points, but it all works well and makes you pull for this wacky family. Also, I have to say, the rendering of high school life, office life, and family life is pretty spot-on, though obviously told through the lens of exaggeration for the purposes of entertainment.

6712093,2,B00O4ZC5A0,"This was just my opinion on this movie, but when I watched this movie at school once, I HATED it. I don't understand why so many people were giving it positive reviews. The main reason why I disliked it so much was because there was a baby in it that kept crying its head off for SO many times because of it losing its 'bumblebee' pacifier, and it would not shut up. On the bright side, there actually were two parts I did find a bit good, and that was the baby learning his first word, 'Fommy', (father/mommy) and a scene where one of Alexander's older brothers knocked down a few trophy cases in a high school hallway and the teacher called him 'Wreck-It Ralph' when telling him to come back to class. I do have it to say, it shows a really good point of view of a family having a rough day. Because I'd feel the same way. Technically, I only saw half of the movie but I stopped because there was too much crying.
When I started watching this movie, I was expecting it to be good and humorous, like the 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' movies and books which are awesome. I totally prefer the original 1972 book on which this movie was based, which was a childhood favorite book of mine. Don't waste your money on this film unless you really want to see it and choose to ignore critical reviews, but in that case, maybe just watch it free online or rent it if it's at a video store near you, in case you don't like if because you wouldn't want to throw away your cash for a bad movie that you wouldn't want to watch anymore, if you know what I mean. For my advice, I recommend watching movies like 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid', 'The Three Stooges', 'Elf' starring Will Ferrell, or the Mr. Bean movies for GOOD humor. At least what I think is good.",1425686400,,1733,4.191616766467066

6712095,2,B00O4ZC5A0,"There were a few parts of this movie that I laughed out loud, but most of the movie was trying so hard for laughs it was ridiculous.  It's like an annoying, unfunny person trying to get constant attention.  Just about every scene had to have something ""funny"" happening.  The daughter barfing, the dad in his goofy pirate shirt, the goofy pirate shirt catching fire, the daughter drinking too much cough medicine and getting drunk then doing a play and knocking all the scenery down, and it goes on and on and on.",1425600000,,513,4.554347826086956

Alexander, the middle child, seemed to have bad luck because he was ignored, bullied, and treated like an outcast pretty much. But, his life changed when he wished that his family would also have a bad day too. His wish came true... But, everything turned out so much better when Alexander had his birthday party.

This movie would make you believe that bad days must happen so that you can have even better days ahead.",1425427200,,476,4.588235294117647

We have all had ""one of those days"" where nothing seems to go right, and that is depicted to the highest degree in this movie.  I watched this and hurt just because of some of the situations and ""bad luck"" that occurred, but it was all done with such hilarity it was a great combination.  My children (6 and 8) both LOVED this movie and it was appropriate for their ages.  We rented this on a 3 day rental and we plan on taking full advantage of that time frame by watching it multiple times.  One of my favorite scenes was the Dick Van Dyke children books reading!",1425254400,,696,4.203007518796992

6712324,4,B00O4ZC5A0,"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (Disney, PG, 81 min.). Looks like the filmmakers went for the world's longest title. The good news is the film is funny enough to sustain the title. thanks in great part to Steve Carell as the father, Ben Cooper, and all the physical things that go wrong throughout the day. This is a key day for the family as well: Ben, who has been unemployed for seven months after being laid off from the aerospace industry, has a job interview; daughter Emily (Kerris Dorsey) is debuting as Peter Pan in the school play; big brother Anthony (Dylan Minnette) is taking his driving test and then heading to Junior Prom with one of the hottest girls in school; and Alexander (Ed Oxenbould), who always seems to be having a horrible day, is turning 12 and is going to have a birthday party that no one is going to attend because classmate Philip Parker, whose birthday is not actually until next week, has moved his spectacular birthday party up to the same night.
After a day that included him accidentally setting a fire in chemistry class, a depressed Alexander makes a birthday sundae with a candle and, when he blows out the candle, wishes that his family will experience a horrible day like he does. When the family wakes up in a few hours, it seems like Alexander's wish has come true -- with a vengeance. Alexander's baby brother loses an encounter with a green marker; sister Peter Pan imbibes too much cough medicine; dad has his own fire issues while trying to impress potential bosses at a hibachi restaurant; mom trying to stop Dick Van Dyke from reading from a children's book with a bad misprint at a press event; and Anthony has the funniest driving test ever. What impresses is that the family's tight bond continues throughout the disastrous day, and ultimately triumphs.
Bonus features include book author Judith Viorst and her son, Alexander, reminiscing about the children's book (5 min.); director Miguel Arteta and cast discussing the Outback-themed birthday party (7 min.); Oxenbould's brief video diary (6 min.); bloopers (4 min.); and the ""Hurricane"" music video by The Vamps.

So, even with people bashing the ""penis"" word in the movie....the movie made me smile and laugh.

6712677,5,B00O4ZC5A0,"I CANT say anything bad about the movie. I loved the movie; enough to buy it on Blu Ray
The Blu Ray contained extras that were not on the DVD. I buy DVD's And Blu Rays because I love the extras. Frankly I wish that there would have been more.
HOWEVER,  there is one so called ""feature"" that turns out to be infinitely annoying. on the Blu Ray. Whenever you use the button to PAUSE, Reverse, or Fast Forward, there is a totally annoying ""pop up"" that shows up on the left side of the screen and extends to the middle.
I'm sure that everyone knows what its like to see pop ups annoying you on a computer screen. THIS thing is equally annoying. It blots out part of the left side of the picture and stays there until you return to normal play operation. Its exact purpose is pretty much unknown. It contains the chapter you are watching and the run time. Both are features that every player already has and can be accessed if needed. So WHY should it impose itself into the movie when you pause or navigate.
I like to pause sometimes and watch certain scenes frame by frame. Its fun to stop and see certain details that are lost in action shots. But this pop up has the potential to obscure things you might want to see. So WHY have it. I have never seen this before. Its actually NOT on the DVD. Just the Blu Ray. I have checked from someone who has the DVD.  Im sorry now that I didn't buy the combo pack withe Blu ray and DVD together. But who was to know in advance.
If having an unobscured  picture during pause or fast forward and reverse is important to you as it is to me, buy the DVD or the Combo pack. I hope the word will get out about this and reach the people who produce this material with unwanted and unneeded  obnoxious features. I hope we won't be seeing it in the future.",1424563200,,1787,4.171014492753623

6713161,2,B00O4ZC5A0,"Yes, the message at the end of the movie was very nice, and there were some great laughs in the film also.  What this family goes through in one dreadful day makes for a family fun movie, one would think.  Overall, the message and laughs were there.  I can't argue that.  What bothered me to no end (and also my child as well, who realized at her tender age that this one scene was highly uncalled for, unnecessary and inappropriate and did nothing to add to the movie at all) was the one scene where the mother puts her hand on the leg of her son who is driving the family car and when he shrinks back from her she asks if he's uncomfortable because she walked in on him in the bathroom that morning (which in itself was ok and was actually an amusing scene) because as she explains she's seen  his penis before, actually she's seen her brother's penises also, oh, and actually she's seen ALL the penises of everyone in the car.  Can you spell INAPPROPRIATE?  Yes, we all know mommies see their son's penises.  We (as adults) also know that mommies see daddies penis also.  Ok, that's fine....but what mother SAYS that sort of thing in front of her children and husband?  I can't think of an appropriate moment for that.

I got wondering what has happened to the Wonderful World of Disney!  Are they bending to popular culture?  Are they giving in because ""everyone thinks it's cool?""  I imagine during screenings no one complained (or at least not loudly enough) about this scene as it made it into the movie.  What does that say about society?  Yes, it was one small piece of the movie, but it was NOT expected in a Disney film and I was highly disappointed in a company that I have come to equate with morals and values.  Maybe my head is under the sand, but I was shocked and so glad that I didn't purchase the film, that it was just a rental I could forget in a few days.

As I mentioned, the child I watched this with even found it odd, and that's a 10 year old.  Seems she has more common sense than the Disney executives that produced this film.

Yes, we use the proper words for body parts in our home.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It was the delivery of the line, the nonchalant way it was delivered...and gosh, did she have to go on and on and use the word four times and keep going with it?  No, she didn't.

6713200,4,B00O4ZC5A0,"I did not expect to have the reaction I had to 'Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.' The trailer did nothing for me, and I'm not a fan of Steve Carell. Along with Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, and Ben Stiller, he is best in small doses for me.

But, I thought the kids might like it, so I decided to try it out.

Bottom line: I really liked it. I laughed a lot more than I was expecting to, and I ended up liking each of the family members more than the trailer led me to believe I would. The trailer made it look like Alexander's family was full of either jerks or clueless morons. It also made it look like the movie wanted me to laugh at others' misfortunes. I don't typically enjoy that kind of humor. Fortunately, none of those things were actually what the movie was about.

In this case, the trailer didn't give too much away, it painted the wrong picture. Which is a shame, because this was a really good movie.

I will not go into a scene by scene review. I'll just say this: his family was not full of jerks. It was full of real people. They were neither unrealistically perfect nor unrealistically bratty. They had flaws and made mistakes and said mean things, but -- like real life -- it was in the heat of the moment, when things seem to be spiraling out of control. Kind of like what happens to me on a semi-regular basis.

Just like can happen in real life (when we let it), adversity brought them together. Also, each had their own little moment of realization. I particularly liked the oldest son's light bulb moment. I won't spoil it, but it was perfect.

Ultimately, it was about family, and the importance of it.

And I cried. Holy cow, I cried. There was nothing sad in the movie, but it's one of those rare movies where the heartstrings moment is genuine and earned. I didn't feel manipulated (which usually just makes me grumpy).

Instead, I felt uplifted. How often can I actually say that?",1423872000,3,1937,4.361111111111111

His bad days are to the point that you cant help feeling sorry for him. Feeling a bit sorry for himself he celebrates his birthday by himself with the help of the classroom guinea pig; at the stroke of midnight. His wish is that the rest of the family can see what a very bad, horrible, no good, very bad day really feels like.

The familys very bad day starts first thing in the morning; with the family oversleeping. From there the rest of the day goes down hill. One phrase that Alexander says during the movie really touched my heart. Sometimes we have to experience the bad days, to enjoy the good ones. (paraphrased).

With the help of Steve Carell (Ben Cooper), Jennifer Garner ( Kelly Cooper), Anthony (Dylan Minnett), Emily (Kerris Dorsey), Alexander (Ed Oxenbould, and baby Trevor (played by Elise & Zoey Vargas); this day provides humor and laughs. Bella Thorne (Ceilia)  also plays the girlfriend of Anthony.

Something I like about this film is that although it's a comedy, at the same time, the directors have created a story so it doesn't feel as if it's just one big joke. In my estimation, it is just perfect.

This film has a bubble of unique comedy that sends the audience laughing out loud. And, it has a sprinkle of romance packaged with it which makes it a unique story.

The story starts out showing an eleven-(soon to be twelve)-year-old kid who always has bad days while everyone else in his entire family always has perfect days. On the very early morning of his 12th birthday he wishes that his family members would have a bad day. Well they do! And, phew, is it bad!

This film has comedy that isn't just little jokes or things that are commonly seen in lots of normal comedies but, unique and creative comedy that is really funny. The actors are all well suited to their roles and, something I love about this film is that the ending is not easily predictable. Also, the story is created in such a way that the comedy is just a part of the story. The creators managed to get a very important message through to the audience.

My favorite scene is when the sister is under the weather with a common cold but has a play that day. She decides to drink a whole bunch of cough medicine and gets drunk during the play. This part is absolutely hilarious. The entire audience, including me, could not stop laughing during this scene.

Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day is a young kid film but not too young. I would recommend for ages 9 to 18 and I give it 5 out of 5 stars for a great story, fantastic acting and unbelievable comedy!

With an open mind, I actually enjoyed it. It's good to see that Disney can still make movies with a good message balanced with fun. The story was entertaining, the actors were talented (of course Jennifer Garner and Steve Carell are the best from this movie), but the younger cast was also good.

6713229,4,B00O4ZC5A0,"I don't get to the movies very often.  I have three kids, a wife who doesnt share my love of cinema, and a lot of in home responsibilities, and so when I do  get to the movies it is usually to see either a cartoon or some big budget blockbuster I was able to convince my wife I needed a guy date for.  So far this year Ive been to the movies eleven times (seriously, thats it) and while I do enjoy some of the kids movies I take in, it would be nice if I could see a film for ME every once in a while.

So, my eldest daughter is trying to branch out into movies and television shows aimed more for her age group, and this has me anxious because I hate most of them.  Shes been watching those Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies and watching those awful Disney shows that pretty much paint adults as complete idiots and encourage obnoxious behavior.  I try and ban them from the house, but there is only so much Dora I can force on her before she literally wants to punch me in the face.  She saw the preview for Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day and begged and begged and then she got my youngest daughter to chime in with  Ive wanted to see it my whole life and then my son stared at me and I knew he wanted to see it too and my wife said lets go to the movies and there I was, sitting in a row of children slobbering over popcorn and anticipating Steve Carell getting kicked by a kangaroo while I was commiserating over my envy of the young couple I saw walking hand in hand into Gone Girl at the other side of the theater.

I didn't hate this.

No, in fact, I kind of liked this one a lot.  Where most films of this nature fail because they are so obnoxious in their attempt to appeal to a child, there is something almost reserved about the way in which this horrible day unfolds.  There is a restraint that you may not expect, and while there is lots of absurdity here, it never feels overtly absurd.  In fact, all of it feels rather plausible (like, on their own, all of these things could actually happen) and so watching it felt kind of refreshing.

Where most films like this focus strongly on the disconnect between adults and children and try and dramatize EVERY LITTLE THING, Alexander unifies its family in a swell of positivity so that, even with everything falling apart around them, you never get the feeling that this family is going to crumble.  Jobs are crumbling, markers are being eaten, shirts are caught on fire, pimples are popping, school property is exploding, girlfriends are dumping (lol, dumping) and cars are being WRECKED and yet, even in states of panic and disarray, you can feel the unified front to get on through.  Proof of this underlining feeling is found in a pivotal scene where Alexander confesses his blame for the atrocities of the day and his family erupts in consoling laughter as if to ask, why so serious?

This is a family that is determined to get through everything together because together is exactly where they want to be.

Critics have rallied against this film, singling it out as being nothing new or just a series of badly conceived segments or childish antics, and yet I completely disagree.  Some of the gags seem been there done that and yet the overall execution of the film and the character development here (and overwhelming push for family togetherness) makes this something very different from what were seeing as the norm for pre-teen entertainment.

With an ensemble who understands how to play off these gags well, and some very memorable laugh out loud moments (the whole Dick Van Dyke scene is brilliantly executed, and the Peter Pan fiasco, Jennifer Coolidge showing up and the constant glimpse of a green faced baby made for well-established gags) make for a family film that is fun for everyone, even a guy who longed to ditch for the movie playing across the hall.",1418169600,122,3857,4.413258110014104

Alexander has more terrible days than most, especially compared to the rest of his perfect family. Wishing on his birthday that they could experience the sort of day that he normally has, Liar Liar-style, they do.

What did I think?
Surprisingly amusing! This live-action Disney family film is loosely based on a popular childrens book, so my expectations were low  happily they were exceeded. While so many of these films feature idiot parents, bratty kids and a story aimed at selling Happy Meals, Alexander avoids all that, delivering a nice message about families sticking together.

The jokes were well spread over a typical family posse (9yo, 13yo and parents) and there were enough quality laughs for all for a pass mark. The cast, which include Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner, are dependable but not stretched. The film is good, single-view, inoffensive, forgettable family fun for 7 year olds and up.

6713233,5,B00O4ZC5A0,"The ""family comedy"" genre has been under-explored, and I think it's got so much potential.  Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day takes the basic premise (as well as Alexander's liking for Australia) from the beloved children's story and does really funny things with it.  After seeing it in the theater, I'm already looking forward to getting it on home entertainment (DVD/Blu-ray).  Whereas the children's book is a rant by Alexander which allows you to see the impact attitude has on making a day good or bad, the movie makes Alexander a more clear-headed character, more of a real victim.  Then he makes a birthday wish that the rest of his family could know what it's like to suffer like he is, and the next day, things go great for him and awfully for everyone else in his family.  Steve Carell, playing the dad, is so funny because he is literally NEVER in despair in the midst of extreme calamity in the movie.  He also does some fabulous shrimp-catching in his mouth, which is my favorite scene.  It's structured as a series of incidents affecting each family member, where things are going great for everyone except Alexander, things go great for Alexander and horribly for everyone else, and then they decide to look on the bright side and find solutions to their problems by sticking together.  It's refreshing (because it's so rare) to have a comedy made today with that carefree kind of attitude and a PG rating.  It'd be funny if the busted vehicle--it looks REALLY bad after a failed driver's license exam--was bought at an auction of movie props and put on display somewhere someday.  Also, there's a great cameo appearance by Dick Van Dyke, who must participate in the most embarrassing (in a funny way) joke of the movie.  :-)",1414800000,40,1767,4.741830065359477

This is a short film. This was a fun film to watch once, but I don't plan to sit through it a second time knowing what happens. A rental not a keeper.

The unbelievable part was that a teen boy chooses to be with his embarrassing family over Bella Thorne.",1414281600,3,596,4.3125
