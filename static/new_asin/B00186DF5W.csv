It IS a bunch of great games. but they are clipped down so tight that I feel critial parts of the games are removed.... Im giving it three stars not because  of the choice of games...but because of how the games were edited. Too much removed comentary and  clipped off comentary...  here's a blaring example of what I mean:
Chad Clifton gets hit by a cheap shot from somebody after a play, the Network got the cheapshot on film and showed it during the game, but they deleted that from  this offering....WHY? Worse, JOe Buck is blabing away about the cheap shot but you never get to see it....these games are Treasures...and it's a crying shame if these versions are all there is out there for US DIE HARD Packer Fans !!! Theyve removed so much of the game, between plays,  that's it's frustrating to watch (after the 3rd or 4th time) These games, the way they are edited, feel like a BEAR fan made them. or even a Dallas Fan.

3411828,4,B00186DF5W,"I love watching the old games and would have given this dvd-set five stars if not for an incredibly stupid decision by NFL Films.  On the menu page, they give you all the pertinent information: the date, the Packers' opponent, where the game's being played, and . . . THE FINAL SCORE!  Okay, granted, you know the Packers are going to win; maybe you can even remember if they won big or it was decided in the final minute; but knowing the final score takes all the fun out of watching the fourth quarter.  Will the other team score and force the Packers to make a last-second comeback?  Will they score a touchdown on a big play, settle for a field goal, or just run out the clock?  Well, thanks to some bonehead at NFL Films you already know. On two games so far I stopped watching after 3 quarters, because I knew nothing was going to happen the rest of the game.

If you agree this is a stupid policy, please say so below in a comment.  Perhaps if enough people express displeasure, someone at NFL Films will take notice and mend their ways on future releases.",1375660800,4,1063,4.338383838383838

3411839,5,B00186DF5W,"Born and Bred in southern California, don't ask me why I'm a Packer-fan, but I am, *lol*.

Overall, this is a wonderful set that comes in a plastic case with the front & back 'flip' holders all contained in one place. Nice.

Alas, whoever chose the game on Disk 5, (Packers vs Bengals-- Sept 20, 1992), was an idiot. It's quite possibly the most boring game of all-time. There are so many other, far-superior games that could have been chosen.

Alas, I guess they chose it because it was Brett Favre's first off-the-bench, full-game quarterbacking since the 'star' and starting QB, (Don Majkowski), was injured on the second play of the 1st quarter with a sprained/torn-ligament ankle. Be that as it may, (from an historical perspective), Brett didn't yet have his sea legs and couldn't make a pass to save his life. Literally, only the last 5-minutes of this game is worth watching.

Brett is so young in that game, (23-years-old)... a baby! *lol*. And, boy, did he come a long way from that so-long-ago beginning. But, still, for all the historical sentimentality, I want to see 'Clash of the Titans' football when purchasing game-series DVDs like this.

There is one other complaint I have, but not to do with the games. It has to do with the way the disks were organized. If you ask me, these disks should have been numbered chronologically by DATE.

Example: Disk 1 is the Jan 26-1997 XXXI Super Bowl... and it's fantastic!

However, Disk 4 is the Jan 12-1997 NFC Championship game that led to the XXXI Super Bowl two-weeks later! And I, for one, would have much rather viewed this game before the Super Bowl game on Disk 1.

The way they are, (stupidly, imho), ordered in the case:

1983-- Disk 8
1992-- Disk 5
1995-- Disk 9
1996-- Disk 10
1997-- Disk 4
1997-- Disk 1
1998-- Disk 7
2003-- Disk 3
2004-- Disk 6
2008-- Disk 2

As such, once we watched all these games, (making sure nothing was wrong with the disks), I used a Sharpie and re-numbered them myself; then placed them back in the case that way so I could watch them in order the next time.

All-in-All, I LOVE this set. No commercials, no half-time baloney, no 'cast of thousands' jawing their opinions in pre/post game coverage... just 1-complete game per disk, (about an hour-and-twenty-minutes viewing time for each).

And, perhaps the best part, they always win! So you're always happy to watch no matter what's going on, or how bleak it all looks during the game, *lol*.

This 'Green Bay Packers 10 Greatest NFL Games' series is well-worth the price of admission... go get one, *vbs*.",1309132800,,2555,4.638580931263858
3411840,3,B00186DF5W,"My boyfriend is a big Packers fan, so I bought him this set for his birthday.  Since he received them, he has watched them a number of times.  There is one MAJOR flaw in the set, though.  The set that we received is missing the disc with the 2003 Packers Vs. Raiders - (Favre Stars In Tribute To Father) game, and instead includes a duplicate disc of one of the games with the Seahawks!  This upsets me, because my boyfriend is a HUGE Brett Favre fan, and really wanted to see that game.  Unfortunately, he is unwilling to part with the rest of them long enough for me to exchange it.

2. Packers/Cardinals 1982 playoff game (41-16 Packers)
3. The ""Replay Game"" (C'mon, how you can you NOT have that??)
4. Favre ""closes"" County Stadium with a game winning run against the Falcons ('94)
5. Favre to Sharpe to beat the Lions in '94 playoffs
6. Packers whip the 49ers in the Division Playoffs ('95) 27-17 to show the Pack is Back
7. Freeman's Miracle Catch to beat the Vikings 26-20 in OT ('2000)

My only complaint I guess is the selection of games.  It's understandable that the 60s games aren't there because no one seemed to hold on to broadcast tapes back then.  The 70s were a wash.  I'm glad they included one from the Lynn Dickey era too, as it's fun to see the Dickey-Lofton-Jefferson combo again.
I would have liked to see at least one game from the ""Majik"" season of '89 though... particularly beating the Bears at the last second on the still-controversial ""after further review"" touchdown.
And the one missing Favre game that stands out to me is the wild card game against the Lions where we win at the last second on that bomb to Sterling Sharpe.
I guess it's just a personal preference though.  Still well worth getting!  I hope they release another set.",1235433600,,919,4.7421383647798745

3411856,3,B00186DF5W,"This DVD series would have been much better if it had contained games from the Lombardi era, such as Super Bowl II or the Ice Bowl.  The 1980's Monday Night game is excellent, with very little cuts, but the 1990's Bears game had a few plays cut, which was puzzling.  In the 1996 San Francisco game, there is a shot of the Packers coaches box, and Ted Thompson is visible.  Who would have thought that 12 years later he would have traded away the Packers' legendary quarterback for almost nothing out of spite and vindictiveness?

All the games pre-2007 are in standard format which is how they were broadcast.  But so is the January 2008 Seattle playoff game even though it was broadcast in widescreen format on digital broadcast channels.  My home recording in widescreen format is better than this standard format DVD, so I feel ripped off with this game's DVD.  The opening advertisements, which are the same on each DVD, are annoying.

This collection is a mixed bag with too many recent games.  But I enjoyed the older games, and would marginally recommend this product if you can buy it at a discounted price.",1222128000,3,1115,4.6479591836734695
3411857,5,B00186DF5W,"To those griping about the ""missing"" Ice Bowl and S.B. I & II,  they are part of another set (actually a combo of two 2-DVD sets) which costs about the same as this and contains a lot more historical info, so just buy it and stop whining.  It includes a painstaking reconstruction of the Ice Bowl using thousands of feet of film obtained from many sources, and it has lots of interviews and background stuff missing from this ten-game set.  No true Packer fan could do without both packages

These aren't necessarily the games I would have chosen.  For one thing, most Pack fans would really love to see the V**ings get creamed at least once, or maybe the V**ing game where Favre broke the all-time record for TD passes.  However, surely Set Two will be in the works soon, especially after what happened to the Vikings early in 2008 in Mister Rodgers' Neighborhood, which I nominate for the next collection as being a milestone worthy of Favre's first win on 9/20/92 vs the Bengals.

Despite the absence of purple bloodshed, however, these are all GREAT games, many of them with the Holmgren-coached mid-90's teams with Butler, White, Brown, Levens, Freeman, Brooks, Chmura, Howard, you know the gang, with SB XXXI as the centerpiece, of course.  Most have fine audio and video quality except for Favre's dissection of the Bengals on 9/20/92, and the 1983 Redskins game, but they are still worthy of inclusion and great to watch.

We have to skip a few tracks of noisy NFL blah-blah at the beginning of each disk. I would have also liked to see more background and follow-up on the games, and discussion & interviews with players and coaches.  We get just the bare essentials, with much excised between the plays, including a few entire plays.  This makes the flow a bit jerky and the transitions rather abrupt at times.  However, this is a minor quibble, and it probably helped keep the price down, and enabled the producers to get the set in our hands a few months sooner.

What a tremendous value!  Even the $50 list price in the Lambeau Store would be a bargain at five bucks a game, but nobody has any basis for complaining about this set at the price offered here, just over $2 per game, nice and compact, only about twice as thick as a single DVD package.  These are GREAT games, all but one from the Favre era, surely some of the most watchable years of football that any team ever put together.  The one pre-Favre game has the then-world champ Redskins with Riggins & co. getting the worst of the highest-scoring MNF contest ever with commentary by the tarnished MNF crew, unfortunately, minus Howard Cosell.

All in all, this is easily worth five stars.  Maybe if enough of us buy it, there'll be a sequel.  Not every team could say this, but for the Packers, finding ten more great games should be no problem!

Now what we need are the ten most embarrassing and humiliating losses by the Vikings, Bears, Cowboys, Patriots, and Dolphins.  Just think -- the NFL could sell each of those sets to fans of 31 teams instead of just one . . .

Added:  In the latter category, I remind fellow Razorback fans that Amazon has or had a DVD of the 2000 Cotton Bowl, where the Hawgs embarrassed and humiliated the highly favored UT Longhorns IN DALLAS . . . heh heh heh . . .

ADDED: Sorry, Favre-haters, but I understand how the current situation came to pass, without any evil intent on the part of anyone involved.  Favre was pretty beat-up and discouraged after missing out on another SB ring in Jan 2008, so he decided to hang it up.  GB bosses were correct to design the team around Rodgers, who had already shown what he could do when substituted for Favre in the Dallas game.  Favre has never known anything much except football, so when July rolled around, as he had responded all his life, he just could not resist the siren call of the practice field.  GB management made the right long-term decision to stick with Rodgers, so Favre had to go elsewhere.  The Jets' managers were just penalized for concealing his injuries last year -- would we have wanted another few years of an iron man turning rusty?

As much as I hate to admit it, the V**ings have the best ground game in the NFL, a good match as Favre sees it, (I hope he's wrong).  AP and Taylor will lighten the load on Favre, thus giving his 40ish body a chance at another SB ring (HE thinks, anyway), and letting him again hear his actions set tens of thousands of voices aroar, not always with joy, especially as we GB fans envision the coming season.  That is what Favre has always lived for, and is very hard to resist (not to mention $10-12 mil).  It was no longer available to Favre at GB -- who has a better QB for the next DVD set.  Just as with Favre, GB will need to back Rodgers up with strong protection, good defense, a decent running game, and receivers who get open and hang onto passes, all of which could be coming together now.

I still appreciate how Favre made football (and even the sidelines) so wonderfully watchable, and enjoy experiencing not just a unique player, but a unique team (whose other stars also went on to other teams, including a few to the V**ings), in a unique era.  That era has changed from the present to history, as all eras do.  This set of DVDs allows us to visit that era whenever we wish.",1220832000,8,5304,4.4875
3411858,4,B00186DF5W,"YES, THIS IS COMPLETE GAMES AND 10 DISCS!!!

I just got this in the mail last week and I have had a chance to start watching the games and it is great!  The video quality is surprizingly good so far (I haven't watched the game from 83 yet).  The only thing keeping this from a 5-star would have been some extras.
Also, if the NFL could ever package these with an alternate audio tracks, say, the official Packers radio broadcast it would be amazing, but that is kind of a wish list.  Commentary tracks would be welcome too.
Still, wish list aside, this set is amazing!  Complete NFL games at watch at your leasure!",1220313600,,614,4.350877192982456

If you are a packer fan this is something you must own for your collection. I had these on VHS already but to have them on dvd and look this great is a great surprise",1219968000,,362,3.84
3411861,5,B00186DF5W,"I just bought this set from Sam's club for 32.66. I could not believe it when I saw it. I started watching the Packers at the beginning of '92 and had not missed a game since. 9 of the 10 games that they show are in the Favre-era, which makes it very special for me. There are indeed 10 discs, with 1 full game per disc. I was happy to see that the games were not edited too much. They include every play, instant replays, penaltys and the occasional timeouts. They do cut out some time between plays to make it run smoother and I agree that it does. I would definitely buy this if you are a true Packer fan...unless you recorded these games when they aired, it is very difficult to buy them for this low price.",1219795200,,711,4.122302158273381

In response to the reviewer who asked what fans voted for these games. There where 20 games that fans could vote from. Unfortunately ""Super Bowl I"" and the ""Ice Bowl"" do not exist in complete game format thus they were not included in the 20 games to vote from. ""Super Bowl II"" was voted into the top 10, however, Warner Brothers (company producing the DVD set)found that ""Super Bowl II"" was incomplete as well and the next game with the most votes replaced ""Super Bowl II"". This will be a ""must have"" for all Green Bay Packer and/or Brett Favre fans.",1219536000,5,634,4.521739130434782

The quality of the product is five star.  It's just the contents of the DVDs that is only 'okay'.

I have seen a whole lot greater games than some of the ones that are included in this 10 DVD set.
