8316077,2,B00008G961,"I guess I was hoping for a bunch of early TV appearances and/or film inserts of the Kinks. Unfortunately, Kinks EP only contains 4 songs: Waterloo Sunset, Mr. Pleasant, Plastic Man, and Muswell Hillbilly, all apparently taped for the Beat Club TV show. At least Muswell Hillbilly has an actual live performance rather than featuring the band lipsynching, rather haphazardly, to the original recordings. Worse still, the sound quality is terrible. Why couldn't they at least overlay a remastered version of the original songs over the first three performances? None of the info provided in the 'pop-up' section was a revelation, and a majority of the DVD was used for advertisements for other collections.",1065657600,,704,5.184210526315789
