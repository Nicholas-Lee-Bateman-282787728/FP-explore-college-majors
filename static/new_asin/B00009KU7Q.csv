1883789,2,B00009KU7Q,"I am a huge Frida fan and probably seen every documentary ever made.  I'm sorry to say that ""A Ribbon Around A Bomb"" was a BOMB!  The interview's with Frida's students and people she knew were interesting - but the ""skits"" in between were awful.  The woman who played the part of Frida was a good actress, but if I wanted to see Frida's life acted out, I'd just rent FRIDA with Salma Hayek (greatest movie ever!).  Almost the entire documentary was ""skits"".  Very very dissapointing.",1101859200,,483,4.569767441860465
1883790,5,B00009KU7Q,Si eres un fan de Frida Kahlo o quieres aprender un poco mas de su vida y pintura realmente te recomiendo este DVD. Contiene videos nunca vistos. Es facil de entender y seguir. Realmente lo recomiendo.,1064102400,22,201,4.611111111111111
1883791,4,B00009KU7Q,"As the previous reviewer stated, the combination of the poetry/play/documentary is a bit too much. I personally think the play would be better off if it were on its own. It interrupts the rest of the video. As far as everything else, I'd recommend this video. I was really happy to see real (but short) film footage of Frida, and just for that I'd purchase the video.",1012521600,9,367,4.492537313432836
7991220,5,B00009KU7Q,"In ""La Cinta que Envuelve una Bomba"" we get a different (Mexican) prospective of the famous artist, Frida Kahlo, her life and those who influenced her painting.

This documentary truly does have never-before-seen footage, family interviews, and photographs. As for the photos that we may have scene before there is a new prospective. The presentation is in Spanish and we can tell that much of the perspective is lost in the translation so someone not comfortable with Spanish may need to watch once for the story and again to pick up the nuances.

If this is your only expose to Frida it is a tad curt and even though it covers her life and paintings in a unique way it still leaves out a lot of detail.

An added plus is among the interviewees we see Hayden Herrera the author of ""Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo"". Unfortunately she is relegated to sound bites.

Anyway this documentary is a must have to be a rounded view of Frida.",1507248000,4,936,4.553571428571429

7991223,4,B00009KU7Q,"This is a short and somewhat light documentary of Frida's life. I have several other Freda documentaries and books, so the information contained in this feature was mostly repetitive for me. However, it did contain a couple of paintings and short amateur 8mm movies I had never seen before. Well worth picking up if you are an avid Frida admirer.",1383264000,,346,4.783333333333333
7991224,4,B00009KU7Q,A great informational documentary on the work and life of Frida Kahlo.  Very informative and useful in my classroom to give my students a sense of Kahlo and her work.,1355702400,,166,4.533333333333333

7991226,3,B00009KU7Q,"This video spent too much time highlighting some of Frida's more disturbing paintings (the birthing paintings especially), making it an awkward fit for secondary students.",1302220800,2,171,5.88
7991227,3,B00009KU7Q,This is primarily a narration that could have been done in English rather than Spanish.  The screen consists mostly of Frida's art and photographs that you can't satisfactorily enjoy because you are busy reading the English subtitles while the narration is in Spanish.,1167264000,2,268,5.232558139534884
7991228,5,B00009KU7Q,"""La cinta que envuelve una bomba"" is a Mexican documentary of one of their finest artists, the great Frida Kahlo, who in her tumultuous but short life span of 47 years, added her unique and brilliant voice to the art history of Mexico, and the world. In an age when a woman artist was rarity, she gained fame for her work in the US and Europe, and this film shows many of her better known pieces, as well as some that are seldom seen.

Her tragic life, starting with polio as a child, her devastating accident with a tram, and what she would call her ""other accident,"" her life with Diego Rivera, are all well covered, with some marvelous still photographs, and film footage. Two moments I have never seen before tell significant stories in their body language: One is in color, with Frida and Diego sitting together. Frida is fixing her hair and kissing Diego, and in another segment, she is on a balcony with a shy and hesitant woman. In the first scene she is the subservient one, in the latter she makes a show of being the domineering one. It is two sides of Frida, captured by the camera for all time.

Directed by Jesus Muoz Delgado, with narration by Jose Lavat, the voice of Frida is done by Andrea Ferrari, and original music by Eugenio Tussaint. Among the people who are interviewed in this documentary are biographers Martha Zamora and Hayden Herrera, psychologist Anando Almazan, historians Teresa del Conde, and Olivier Debroise, journalist Ana Cecilia Trevino, and painter (and former Khalo student) Arturo Garcia Bustos.

In Spanish with subtitles (with the exception of the excerpts with Herrera, who speaks in English), total running time for this excellent documentary is 60 minutes.",1120780800,14,1702,4.762711864406779
7991229,5,B00009KU7Q,"I have seen a few movies about Frida Kahlo in my time, but this short documentary has been the best so far. It gets down to the facts about her life quickly. It reveals more about her life, growing up in the midst of the Mexican Revolution, her terrible bus accident in 1925 that nearly chopped her in half. At age 21 she joins the Communist party and meets the famous muralist Diego Rivera. It talks about her affairs with women and Leon Trotsky. How her love for Diego was special and went beyond infidelity since they divorced and remarried (although kept separate quarters). She was willing to accept that he was a womanizer, and he just cared for her too much so they learned to make the best out of their unusual relationship/marriage.
What I found interesting was that she mentions in the documentary that she did not think she was painting art intentionally, but only what she was feeling. As her pain (emotional and physical) progressed her art became better. Salvador Dali was the one that told her she was a ""surrealist"", and gave her a special set of earrings of some little hands.
Eventually she begins to drink to curb her pain, and they amputate the leg that was affected with polio as a child. When she expired at the age of 47 in 1954, they claimed it was a form of pulmonary disease, but others say it was most likely an overdose of painkillers.
I recommend this documentary if you are a Frida fan, because so far it seems to be the most accurate. I have been avoiding the new Hollywood production with Selma Hayek, since it got bad reviews and there is supposed to be too much unnecessary nudity.

This dvd is in Spanish with English subtitles, and it did loose some during the translation as I was listening and trying to read at the same time.",1107734400,13,1764,4.478260869565218
