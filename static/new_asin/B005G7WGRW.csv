4689690,3,B005G7WGRW,Death Bell Blood Camp is the sequel to Death Bell. They upped the death count for this sequel and the scenes are more bloodier. But the problem I had with the film was the pacing. It seemed kind of off to me.,1353628800,,208,3.9761904761904763

8471333,2,B005G7WGRW,"After a swim meet, a girl meets a black ink/mist entity in the swimming pool and is spooked out. The kids at school study for exams as we are introduced to a new teacher.

Their exam takes a twist as the students are locked in. They are being killed off one by one. In order to survive they must figure out who and why.

As a slasher film , it had enough blood, but as a ghost film, it wasn't that scary. The film poorly combined slasher and supernatural elements with flashbacks that didn't seem to mean much. I couldn't get into the film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Attempted rape.",1401408000,,599,4.283185840707965
8471334,1,B005G7WGRW,I've watched both the Death Bell movies and I favor the first one over this one. This one disappointed me.,1396051200,,106,4.35
8471335,5,B005G7WGRW,"This movie series is always a little bit funny, I like this movie quite a bit but I don't think it's very scary. There are parts of this movie where you wonder about what your watching. It's interesting as long as your friend watching with you actually pays attention to the movie but that's neither here nor there. This movie could use a bit of a change when it actually shows people dying because those scenes aren't that believable but I enjoy the movie anyway.",1395446400,2,464,4.470588235294118
8471336,5,B005G7WGRW,"I saw the first Death Bell movie I was living for that movie. When I saw there was a sequal, I had to have it. This movie is bloody perfect.",1393545600,,140,3.7
8471337,3,B005G7WGRW,"Death Bell: Bloody Camp (actually Death Bell 2) has an interesting idea.  Thirty students are trapped in a school, and tasked with figuring out who among them is a killer.  The death scenes are interesting, well staged, and fairly nasty.  The actual plot, when pieced together is pretty interesting, and the acting isn't all that bad.

The problem is that so much of the story has to be told in flashbacks that hault the dramatic tension and dread that the scenes in the present are working towards creating. The other problem with the film is that there are THIRTY characters.  It's hard to keep track of everyone, and while the acting isn't bad, no one stands out enough for you to really remember who is who, why they are involved, and why you should care if they live or die.  Once everything does come together, and the real story is revealed, the film gains some focus, and becomes more entertaining, but it takes to long to get to that point.

Death Bell 2 could have been good.  It has some fun moments, but the script is a mess.  Black Rat, The Whishing Stairs, and several other films have told similar stories, and handled the material much better.  For that, I really can't recommend Death Bell 2.  While it is a good looking film, with a few creative deaths, the over all film is a muddled mish mash of random plot threads that never really amount to much.",1360540800,,1369,4.502024291497976
