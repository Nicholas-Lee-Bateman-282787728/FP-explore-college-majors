8181149,5,B000NSHXMW,"Excellent behind the scenes on the making of the movie 300, fascinating facts in historical context as well. A good addition to my collector's set to 300 also! Even though it may repeat itself from the collector's set, there was enough differences it made it worth getting !",1312761600,,274,4.729166666666667
8181150,5,B000NSHXMW,Joe Mac Guy gives nothing but bad reviews and therefore I'm going to counteract this troll with a very positive review.,1218931200,6,119,4.714285714285714
8181151,3,B000NSHXMW,". . .but if you're looking to see what all the hype is all about with the movie '300', this dvd will certainly whet your appetite.  There are interviews, clips and much more, and well worth the investment for any fan of 300, Frank Miller, and/or Gerald Butler (and not necesarily in that order), who is collecting such things.

If you've already seen the movie, and just don't have the storage space for a dvd of stuff that is already on the issued dvd, and considering that it was free with a product purchase from retailers earlier this year (AND the fact that the ticket would only be of collectible value but expired quite a number of months ago), you're better off to save your money and get the other 300 related items, such as the dvd, or the book, or the action figures.",1193875200,2,778,4.395833333333333
