8492315,5,B002FB66SC,"For those trying to understand the ""flawed values and decision-making"" that led the US to disaster in Vietnam, these 2 interviews with Robert McNamara are excellent.

The ""good"" of Robert McNamara is his belated recognition that the US was not fighting international communism in Vietnam, but rather, a centuries-old effort of Vietnamese (in both North Vietnam and South Vietnam) to run their own nation and determine their own destiny.  Because this centuries-old drive for freedom permeated the core of the North Vietnamese people and military (as well as the core of South Vietnamese VC and urban leftists), the US was fought to a stalemate despite its overwhelming military superiority.

The ""bad"" of Robert McNamara is: (i) his failure to recognize that it was wrong to destroy a third world nation (and ancient culture) with massive bombing as he  struggled to understand the nature of the conflict, (ii) his failure to understand that charts and numbers cannot measure the potential for ""victory"" as can human drive, and love of country and culture, and (iii) his failure to apologize to US servicemen and women (and families of MIAs and KIAs), many who still suffer today.",1376697600,,1180,5.098445595854923
