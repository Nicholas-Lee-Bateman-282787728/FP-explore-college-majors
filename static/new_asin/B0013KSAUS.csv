3115708,5,B0013KSAUS,"I purchased a used Fender student model S-10 about 25 years ago and learned to play a few chords but that's all. If this video had been available at the time, I would have made much better progress on the pedal steel guitar. Rob Haines does a superb job of explaining everything a beginner needs to know about the pedal steel and shows how simple it is to get that classic sound heard on so many country tunes. The video shots are excellent; showing both hands (you can even see the strings being picked) with an inset showing what his feet are doing as well. This guy is a great teacher who makes you feel like you really can play like a pro. All it takes is practice, practice, practice. This video was worth every penny and there is enough material here to keep me learning for many months.",1283558400,4,793,4.328859060402684
3115709,5,B0013KSAUS,This is an excellent DVD course. It starts at the very beginning but the information is all rock solid and the instructor shows how but leaves it to you to go ahead and take what he has taught. I am only part way through it now but it is all very helpful. I am a musician but have no background in steel guitar and this video is the catlayst that has got me started and to the point where music is coming out. I wish that there were one on the C6 neck like this too.,1268352000,4,466,3.8645833333333335
3115710,5,B0013KSAUS,"I've played other stringed instruments for about 40 years and just started pedal steel. I own both this DVD (Anyone can play E9) and the Bruce Bouton DVD (Learn to play pedal steel guitar). Anyone can play E9 pedal steel by Rob Haines is excellent. It does cover all of the basic details a true beginner will need, such as how to wear finger picks, how to hold the bar and tuning your guitar. He also makes some useful suggestions on which equipment to use. The lesson itself covers basic scales, harmony scales, pedals, knee levers and a multitude of useful licks. The biggest difference between this DVD and Bruce Bouton's, is that this one uses a split screen to clearly show what your hands need to do and what your feet need to do. The other DVD does not use split screens and can be a little confusing for someone who hasn't played any other stringed instruments.  But if you're a true beginner and need to choose only one, get Anyone can play E9 pedal steel. It goes into greater detail on the basics. The pedal exercises and scale drills are excellent and Haines shows you how to combine them to sound like a song.",1262822400,21,1122,4.446601941747573
3115711,5,B0013KSAUS,"I just started playing PSG and this is the best of several DVDs that I have seen. Very clear, good camera work, good diagrams and the instructor makes it look very easy because he explains it so well. This is truley a beginners DVD but a very well done production.",1247616000,2,264,4.3

8251582,4,B0013KSAUS,"Excellent DVD but to get 5 stars they would have needed to include tab files or at least some written instruction  The instructor talks you thru what he is playing but it is difficult to catch and I had to keep backing up the video trying  to write down the instructions, I finally gave up on the DVD.  Maybe later after I get a bit further along with learning the steel I will give this DVD another try.
If you are fast play along with the instructor or write down the instructions it is a great DVD, if not you will get lost",1456790400,,526,4.087378640776699

8251585,5,B0013KSAUS,"Out of all the books and information on the pedal steel guitar that I've read in recent years, this DVD is without question the best source of immediate information available to the beginning pedal steel player. The con is that I wish there was an accompanying book to illustrate those areas of tuning, exercises etc. versus having to rewind the DVD each time.",1390348800,,360,4.73015873015873
8251586,3,B0013KSAUS,I'm just learning to play and have no music background so I'm have allot to learn. I'm sure it will help once I learn the chords and fret changes with pedals and knee levers. Learning to play pedal steel takes allot of time but its also fun as you learn. Enjoy yourself it does take time. You will enjoy it and you will be able to play your heart out.,1370822400,2,351,4.0285714285714285
