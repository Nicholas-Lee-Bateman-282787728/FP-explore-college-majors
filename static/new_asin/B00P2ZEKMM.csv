8686322,5,B00P2ZEKMM,"Fans of Hanna-Barbera's 60s-era ""The Impossibles"" cartoons should be interested in obtaining this set as the Super Globies seem to have acquired the earlier hero team's powers (Nate Branch as Fluid Man, Geese Ausbie as Multi Man, and Curly Neal and Twiggy Sanders splitting Coil Man's powers as bouncy Super Sphere and springy Spaghetti Man respectively plus Sweet Lou Dunbar taking a cue from Pockets of the Ant Hill Mob in ""The Perils of Penelope Pitstop"" as Gizmo Man with various gadgets hidden on his person...inside his huge Afro hairstyle).  Mix this in with the typical cartoon Globetrotters clever basketball stunts versus teams of cheating bad guys bent on world domination and behold this bizarre but fun series is born.  Silly but memorable.

Hopefully the original ""Harlem Globetrotters"" cartoon series might see a DVD release soon with Stu Gilliam and Johnny Williams originating Curly and Geese and Scatman Crothers voicing Meadowlark Lemon the charismatic Globies leader (and played Nate Branch/FluidMan's voice in ""Super Globetrotters"") and short and excitable Pablo, slow talking Gip, and burly Bobby Joe.",1423094400,4,1123,5.369318181818182
