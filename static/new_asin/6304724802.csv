7878890,3,6304724802,Ted Raimi fans will love this movie because there is so much of Ted in it. He did an excellent acting job in this. It was much better than I thought it would be.,1366675200,,161,3.764705882352941
7878891,2,6304724802,"Worth watching once to see the movie it might have been. An amazing performance from Raimi, who slides deftly among the layers of the psychopathic title character without once overplaying his hand in a truly chilling performance. Ricki Lake is also subtle and effective as the unhappy landlady with a slowly growing attraction for her strange boarder. Unfortuately, the high-caliber performances are wasted on a meandering script and unfocused direction -- and a fatally slow pace which destroys any interest we might have in what's going on. As for the gore, it isn't that it's too much, it's that it's not enough. Too little and too late, it's almost half-an-hour before we know anything more about the movie than what we read on the box, and by then we're no longer interested. A shame, and most of the people involved deserved better.",990057600,6,838,4.908450704225352
7878892,1,6304724802,"This movie is really a dog.  If any of you Ted Raimi fans out there ever watch this one and then later meet Ted, don't let him know you watched it.  He'll make fun of you!  Now that's the sign of a really bad movie!  No redeeming factors here that I can see at all.  Now, if you'll all excuse me, I think I'll go watch some paint dry.",977961600,,334,3.782608695652174
7878893,2,6304724802,"I only bought this dvd because ted raimi was in it, don't get me wrong seeing him semi naked was fanastic but the quality of  this disc is  terrible as after three plays it is jumps and pausing when it feels like  it. Very disappointed about the quality, but I am still happy as the  overall movie is interesting.",966384000,3,313,4.254237288135593
7878894,1,6304724802,"The DVD is the EDITED R-rated version and is missing all the intense gore effects in the original ""unrated"" VHS release.  It's also an awful transfer so avoid at all costs.  The uncut VHS version is definitely  worth a look, though....even if just for the excellent grue.",952560000,12,271,4.723404255319149
7878895,2,6304724802,"Ted Raimi is this movie's only saving grace, and the only reason I bought it.  Here's a question for you: If Traci Lord's vengeful character Heidi is so ashamed of the way she looks, then why does she spend the whole movie  dressed in nothing but lingerie and a trench coat?  And did you notice that  Dennis carves up that chicken with a dirty knife?  Yuck!  This movie was  obviously the brain child of a male mind.  Don't bother unless you are a  big Ted Raimi fan.",950745600,4,467,4.275862068965517
7878896,3,6304724802,"i only ordered skinner only because it is a hard to find title and after seeing a interview in a issue of fangoria on ted raimi it looked like it  could of been a graet horror flick. After viewing simitar's transfer to  disc all i can say is that it is a terrible transfer the sound echos and  even a bad jump in the picture that is obvisiously from the master tape  used in the transfer. the only thing keeping this this low budget shocker  afloat is ted raimi fine performance that makes me still gives this film 3  stars. there is one thing that was not explained in the film ""what is  skinners obsessession with running water?"" Overall it was an  interesting low budget flick that also gets my thumbs up to KNB for the fx.",941241600,,726,4.248175182481752
