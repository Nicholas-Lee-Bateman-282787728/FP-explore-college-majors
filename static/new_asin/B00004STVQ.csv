7922115,5,B00004STVQ,I think you might be better of just buying the whole show season 1 all the way to 5 that is what I did and I got weeding in Las Vegas and Hawaii style fo 49.00 that is what I think you should do,1424217600,,194,3.4318181818181817
7922116,5,B00004STVQ,I bought this for someone else so I can't really elaborate on how good this video is.  My sister said it was good though!,1385424000,,121,4.041666666666667

I mean it when I say that even after 10 years (and after hundreds of viewings) this show NEVER gets old. Although I regret that episodes are no longer in production, (I'm still trying to figure that one out), the edisodes remain timely, fresh, thought-provoking. No one succeeds at the art of serio-comic realism quite like the folks at SBTB. I bust up at the antics of Screech (Dustin ""Move over Carrot Top"" Diamond) every time! The rest of the kids are great, and who doesn't love Principal ""Bustin' Chops"" Belding?! Scraping the bottom of the barrel, my only criticism to this boxed set is I don't know HOW on God's Green Earth they could have omitted the totally harrowing ""uppers"" edisode, in which Jesse becomes a teenage speed freak in order to cope with her full academic and extra-curricular plate at Bayside High (played emphatically by Liz Berkley). I was a high school honor student and drum majorette, so can I relate or can I RELATE?! Liz only topped this performance once, and that was for the hit movie ""Showgirls,"" in which the dame strikes every human emotion imaginable, rivaled only by the strike of an economy-sized Gong. (see also my review on ""Showgirls"")
Move over ""My So-Called Life"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"", Saved by the Bell will never die!

7922118,5,B00004STVQ,"Very rarely does a half hour teen show climb such heights of artistic achievement. I dare you to fine a better portrayal of teen angst, just try to find it pokie, you can't, so just give it up. As any informed viewer would know, Saved by the bell was the training ground for the wonderful Liz Berkley...you can see all the promise that would be fulfilled in the woefully underrated ""show girls"". And if Screech is not the prototype for the sensitive young male, than who is...I could go on and on, but just watching this wonderful collection is the best way to say hello to excellence... I salute you Mr. Belding!!!",1019260800,3,615,4.5
7922119,5,B00004STVQ,"Saved By the Bell is the best teen show ever made. Thank god a show this cool and funny has a best of hits on video, I just hope they can make it on dvd soon.",997228800,6,158,3.4166666666666665
7922120,1,B00004STVQ,"People who dismissed the acting, scriptwriting and teleplay of 90210 for being manufactured and unrealistic have obviously not seen this wretched series.
Although (once again) we have a group of ""popular"" teens attending a wealthy California high school,the set looks like somebody shot the series in their garage (ie it actually looks cheap and like a TV set!)with cardboard everything. It's also worth nothing that the driver's ed ""car"" that is occasionally driven through the hallways in the school(!) is actually a golf car with a cardboard box cutout attached to it(!!)and no school with that wealth would have actually used that as a drivers ed training module.
The only reason why I have to give it one star, both on the realities of the rating system and in my heart is because the show suggests through the reccuring character of Jessie Spano that young women can be dedicated feminists/activists, be popular, attractive and still get the hot guy of their dreams. Sure, Elizabeth Berkley was just as talentless as the rest of them and trashed her career with Showgirls, but her Saved By the Bell character was a HUGE departure from the conventional scriptwriting for teen targeted drama which 90210 never really got to other than Brenda's obvious ""take no garbage"" attitude and Andrea's activism at a general purpose teen line. I am certain in the hands of a better show production team and actress, Saved By the Bell could have been a very memorable show and a serious contender for ratings.
Unfortunately, it was not",986515200,,1527,4.945525291828794
7922121,5,B00004STVQ,"... I loved this video. The back of the tape only lists three episode, but four were on the tape, three of those from ""The College Years.""
The episodes included are: ""Graduation,"" ""Pilot"" (of ""The College Years), ""Marry Me,"" and ""Wedding Plans.""
These are great episodes! They are not definitive of the show in general, but if you are a fan of the show, you will not want to miss this video. If you were a fan of the original series, but did not watch ""The College Years,"" here's your chance to see how and why Zack and Kelly decided to get married. :-)
The ""Graduation"" episode is classic ""Saved by the Bell"" hijinx and silliness, with a little bit of sentimental mush, which I loved. This is from the original series and is the last episode with Jessie and Kelly.
The ""Pilot"" episode showed Zack, Screech, and Slater maturing and finding their way in college where they weren't the ""top dogs"" any more. This is the very first episode of ""The College Years."" Kelly is not in this episode.
""Marry Me"" shows Zack proposing to Kelly. It's a great scene. Our whole family always laughs out loud during the scene where Dean McMann is showing the slides. Zack's dream is also hilarious. This is the 2nd-to-last episode of ""The College Years.""
""Wedding Plans"" is very funny, but with a great semi-serious scene between Zack and Kelly near the end. We love Zack and Kelly's fantasy about their apartment and their future life, and then the contrasting reality of it. :-) If you've wondered why Zack and Kelly decided to get married in Las Vegas, here's your chance to find out! I don't want to give too much away if you haven't seen this episode, but one of the ""missing"" members of the old gang shows up in this last episode of ""The College Years.""
One other thing to note...entire scenes or parts of scenes were cut from most of these episodes when they were put into syndication. This tape contains the full versions which you won't see on TV now. :-)",977961600,20,1947,4.534090909090909
7922122,5,B00004STVQ,"Anyone who followed the show at all will love this video of episodes. You will remember the good ol days with zach, lisa ,slater,kelly,Jessie, even screech heaven forbid. I would strongly reccomend this to any saved by the  bell fan.",963100800,11,233,4.825
