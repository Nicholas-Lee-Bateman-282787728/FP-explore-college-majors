8711736,5,B00VYL4OV0,"This movie is something special. Take one blue collar Chuck Norris wannabe, add an evil karate master with a hot temper and a ridiculous mustache who runs a white slavery ring specializing in 80's chicks with gigantic hair, mix in loads of backyard karate, hilarious dialogue, and a gooey 80's synthesizer soundtrack...and you have the makings of an extremely entertaining movie. Like the DVD says...it kicks ass from start to finish. B-movie Legend Joel D. Wynkoop wrote, produced, and directed this early 90's shot-on-video classic deep in the swamps of Florida, and it is easily the best movie he has ever done. Highly recommended for anyone who loves b-movies, 80's Cannon/Chuck Norris/Charles Bronson movies.

I also have to recommend this disc for the tons of bonus features it contains. Two commentary tracks, a feature length documentary on the making of the movie (from the early 90's), a lost intro that features Wynkoop singing a hilariously cheesy song about a ""Photogenic Woman"", and it also has a lost 8mm karate movie Wynkoop did when he was a teenager. Tons of bang for the buck here. Nice packaging. Great cover art. Definitely a keeper. This is the kind of release collector's want from an independent DVD label. And, Cult Movie Mania knocked this one out of the park. It's right up there with their release of Marcus Koch's ROT...which also stars Wynkoop.",1442016000,,1374,4.973913043478261
