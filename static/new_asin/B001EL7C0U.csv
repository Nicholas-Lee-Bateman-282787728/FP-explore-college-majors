8298597,1,B001EL7C0U,"While I found several of his other DVDs to be somewhat helpful, this one stops short of anything I could recommend. I also have taken a workshop in this type of healing and frankly I feel Shamanism relies not a bit on actual energy. But rather more about your willingness to 'believe' it is actually a method of clearing! Whether it be healing past lives, or negative situations that occurred in a current lifetime, that is its basis. A mindset.

Shamanic healing! Soul retrieval; new age money making phrases. So many books and such out there now!  Beware of the number of people claiming to be healers with these methods. Funny how one never finds Native American Indians writing these books or making DVDs about Shamanism.  They are the rightful inheritors of this school of healing.

I also found this particular DVD to be redundant. The redundancies being within itself and also in along with the flow of his other  DVDs.  In other words, purchasing his Remove Psychic Debris or Reiki Attunement DVDs are all you need to give yourself a boost. Also hypnotherapists bank their money upon you believing in something and visualizing the outcome you desire. So one or two of his DVDs will help you visualize in that way.

But as with all his DVDs, the music and visuals are very soothing and pleasant!",1422489600,,1302,4.709251101321586
8298598,5,B001EL7C0U,"I have been acquiring and using Steve Murray's books, CDs, and DVDs for Reiki and other healing techniques for over a year now.  Every time, his attunements have proven effective (I've had friends mention the increase in my abilities).  Right now, I only Reiki friends and family; by the end of summer, I hope to have my own business started.  If you are a healer or want to be a healer/Reiki healer, I highly recommend any of Steve's products.  Thank you, Steve!",1363046400,2,463,4.609756097560975
8298599,5,B001EL7C0U,"Steve's set of books and the two DVD's that go along with his Reiki Master program are invaluable for the Reiki Practitioner. The Reiki Master Attunement DVD gave me a true attunement, enhancing my healing abilities. Steve's books, Reiki the Ultimate Guide, Ultimate Guide Vol 2, Ultimate Guide Vol 3, Ultimate Guide Vol 4, and Reiki Beliefs Exposed For All are fabulous and filled with a wealth of information. His DVD, A Reiki 1st, Aura and Chakra Attunement Preformed, is an excellent companion to the books demonstrating the actual processes of performing attunements. I will use this set again and again as reference along my path of Reiki healing.",1258329600,3,653,5.0
8298600,5,B001EL7C0U,I am working on my master's in mental health counseling. I will be using methods like meditation and Reiki in my practice. In the past people marketed Transcendental Meditation (TM) to make large sums of money. The concept of meditation was good but using it to bilk large sums of money from others was just wrong. Reiki is at a crossroads. People must decide if it is to be used just as a money making scheme or for the betterment of mankind. The concept of Reiki works. It has helped many people. But like TM some see Reiki as a way to make large sums of money off others. Steve Murray has taken Reiki and made it available to everyone at a fair price. His books and tapes work. Bravo Steve!,1240531200,4,693,4.297709923664122
8298601,5,B001EL7C0U,"I watched this video this morning 3/29/09, and experienced a healing.  Earlier in the week I had fallen down three steep steps and my left knee was very painful.  It improved to some extent during the week but following a very long shift at my job on Saturday I had trouble walking.  It did not improve overnight and I had trouble sleeping with the pain that extended into the hip area and lower back. I wondered how I would be able to go to my work on Monday, much less prune the fruit trees and do after winter clean up in the garden that I had planned for today.  Well I watched the video and at the end there was a release from pain segment.  During this time I felt the need to stretch and turn as I sat on my chair.  When I got up at the end of the video I was able to walk normally without any pain at all in my left knee, hip or lower back. I had a wonderful long day in the garden, pruning and clearing up winter debris. (Some of my psychic debris had been cleaned up and pain released.)
So do I recommend this video and the work of Steve Murray?  Absolutely.
I am most thankful to Steve Murray, an excellent and very generous teacher and healer.",1238284800,14,1155,4.084070796460177
8298602,5,B001EL7C0U,"This whole series is really very informative! I have a lot of Steve's Reiki books so when this new subject came out I thought I would explore it.

I was very surprised and the ton of information given throughout the set. I usually stick with the reiki books and this series can be incorporated with or without reiki. As a practicing Reiki person myself, all this information will be quite helpful in my sessions with my clients! Thank you Steve!",1238025600,6,445,4.5625
8298603,5,B001EL7C0U,"I have most of Steve Murray's Books and DVDs and they are wonderful. I just received the DVDs in his Remove Psychic Debris and Heal series, and this might be his best work yet. I highly recommend them if you feel you or somebody in your life might have Psychic Debris, or if you have an interest in Past Lives, Soul Retrieval, and removing negative Psychic Cords.",1237939200,8,363,4.432835820895522
8298604,5,B001EL7C0U,"I have all of Steve Murray's books and DVDs and left a few reviews. But this DVD trilogy did not disappoint me, all three are excellent. What's notable about the DVDs is Steve teaches you how to perform a Past Life, a Soul Retrieval and a Negative Psychic Cord session for yourself, and he also shows you how to guide another person through a session. If you are into this genre of healing, then I recommend all three DVDs.",1236556800,4,423,4.367088607594937
