Besides the suspense you will also be treated to some get humor and fun.  That is the strong suit to these movies.  These are just pure fun to watch.

2542983,5,B000EXDSAW,"As the author of two Charlie Chan books and one of the many persons interviewed for the documentary features, I want to thank Fox Home Entertainment for listening to the fans and going ahead to produce what I hope will be the first of their complete set of known Charlie Chan films to be released on DVD.

From some of those who have already gotten their copies, the comments so far have been excellent and Fox should be commendend for doing a great job, spending good money on the restorations, new art work, liner notes, hiring John Cork) and his production company (who did most of the James Bond documentaries on DVD) to do the documentaries for the Charlie Chan DVD Vol 1.

Because there is a Volume ""1"", I strongly hope that Volumes 2, 3, etc., will follow in quick order to round out Fox's archive of Chan films that will be eagerly awaited by all his fans.

Being also a Mr. Moto fan (having also writen a Mr. Moto book), I will also be eagerly awaiting the August 1, 2006 release date for the first of two volumes of the Mr. Moto DVDs, all staring Peter Lorre, with his trademarked moon-shaped eyes.",1150761600,19,1108,4.421568627450981
2542984,5,B000EXDSAW,"AMEN THE GREAT CHARLIE CHAN IN A DVD BOX SET

Charlie Chan has always been a mystery hero of mine. This box set has  four of the best Charlie Chan in a box.  Included in the collection is Charlie Chan In London (1934), Charlie Chan In Paris (1935), Charlie Chan In Egypt(1935) and Charlie Chan in Shanghai (1935).  Eran Trece, a only Spanish Language Charlie Chan film made (1931) is a bonus to this collection.

I bought some of the loose Chans that MGM released a few years ago. Films titles like Meeting at Midnight, Jade Mask, and Chinese Cat were good, but the masters transfers to DVD didn't seen clean enough copies.

My history with Charlie Chan began about thirty years ago. I remember seeing all the Chan in late 1970's on WDCA channel 20 on sundays. They would run an marathon afternoon of entertainment which started with a  Chan film , then a Blondie movie (which are not a DVD yet), and then finally either a Ma and Pa Kettle or a Francis the Talking Mule or a Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes.

From those sundays, I was hooked on the Hawaii detective with his children-especially his number one or two sons. The mysteries were classic whodunits, the audience were playing along with the Amazing Chan

So Charlie, welcome to DVD-so when is the other 38 films to be released on DVD in a box sets

  the good thing about thse movies is you can watch them with the kids in the room and not worry about them seeing or hearing anything bad. my boys watch them sometimes(my 8 year old doesn't like them as much,but my 6 year old is very much into watching them,he likes to see if he can see who did it) and besides they are a great way to unwind and relax and have a good time.",1146096000,29,691,4.141791044776119
2542986,5,B000EXDSAW,"The Charlie Chan series was one of the most successful in Hollywood history and remains very popular today.

Several years ago, Fox spent over $2 million restoring all of their Chan and Mr. Moto films.  Based on the limited TV airings they received, these films look and sound the best they have in years.  Given Fox's stellar reputation for high quality transfers and their recent conversion to using original poster art for covers, these DVDs will be a wonderful addition to a classic film library.

Although all the Fox Chans benefited from strong writing and high production values, these early films were clearly ""A"" level productions with elaborate sets and strong supporting casts including Ray Milland and (in an early role) Rita Hayworth.

Kudos to Fox to recognizing the high demand for these films.  Let's hope the remaining Chans and Motos will be fast tracked.

Urgent plea to Amazon - please remove the numerous listings of bootleg Chans.  If this set is to succeed, consumers can't be confused by illegal wannabees.",1142640000,201,1030,4.982456140350878

2543003,4,B000EXDSAW,"Bottom Line First: Charlie Chan, Vol 1 brings together 4 early Charlie Chan, Warner Orland movies and a re-make of a fifth in Spanish, with a Spanish caste. All filmed in the first half of the 1930s and all decidedly from the B grade part of the old Fox film lot. Never mind the B Grade. Recommendation: this is classic rainy day, family night black and white detective movie entertainment.  I am a Warner Orland fan and believe this collection will charm and entertain you and yours for many showings.

Someone seemed to think that every disk needed to contain the same trailer for Charlie Chan in London. That person may want to re consider.

The rest of the 4 short Charlie Chan documentaries were interesting. The first seemed like little more than a pep talk to end the modern day worries about Chan as a stereotype Movie China-man. To some degree his character may have been but a little insight. In one of these movies, the respected international detective is confronted by an obviously out of line Englishman who uses exaggerated piddgin English. The very polite Chan, replies in what the documentary tells us is the deliberate speech of a person carefully translating his words from one language to another. OOn the other hand, Charlie Chan in Egypt gives us Lincoln Theodore Monroe Andrew Perry, AKA  Stepin Fetchit (Snowshoes in the movie). I can respect the man for having played white prejudice into regular money making work. I have problems with how degraded was the on screen characters shtick.

The last of the four documentaries was my favorite. I had known that there had been a real Chinese Lawman in the Hawaii PD, Charlie Apana.  He was a roughneck officer who carried a bullwhip, of his own making and who did speak pidgin English. He was also respected. In other words he may have been an inspiration for the writer Earl Biggers to create the Chan books, but the living man was not at all like the fictional one.

I had not expected to like Eran Trace, the 1931 re make of Charlie Chan Carries on, but for a change having to follow subtitles did not leave me feeling impatient. I missed Orland, but the flow of the story kept me watching.

This leads me to my final point. Chan rarely solves the mysteries by some kind of impossible concentration of mental powers. He is more inclined to let the murders over extend themselves. This makes some of the resolution happen fast, (the movies rarely run more than 80 minutes) and avoid the classic cheating of hidden clues and last minutes reveals.

The B movie was intended to be fairly direct. For all of his manners and self  depreciation the Orland/Fox Charlie Chan movies happen fast enough that they cannot drag.",1490400000,2,2687,4.673728813559322

2543006,4,B000EXDSAW,"Charlie Chan Collection Vol 1

Earl Derr Biggers was born in Warren Ohio in 1884. In high school he founded a monthly magazine and went to Harvard. After graduating he became a newspaper reporter, then turned to writing novels. While on vacation in Honolulu he learned about the exploits of Chang Apana, a Chines detective on the Honolulu police force. Biggers wrote six Charlie Chan novels that were successful. His death from a stroke in 1933 ended his career. Five movies were produced before his death. Over forty movies featured Charlie Chan. They were popular in areas with ethnic Chinese populations. Movies that portrayed Chinese in a negative manner were banned in China, such as the Fu Manchu movies. Werner Olands Chan movies were popular in China.

In recent times the popularity of detective stories has waned, unless they are on a police force instead of a owner-operated business. How many movies show a private investigator who clears the innocent and reveals the guilty? Warner Oland was the first actor to star in this popular series. This volume contains five movies plus background information. For more information read Ken Hankes book Charlie Chan at the Movies and Yunte Huangs book Charlie Chan. The Charlie Chan movies used to be shown on local television stations decades ago. TV prefers films in color instead of the monochrome common to many films before the 1960's. You should enjoy these as examples of mystery movies. See the individual reviews for more details.

Disk 1: Charlie Chan in London (1934) - find stolen military secrets and a murderer.
Disk 2: Charlie Chan in Paris (1935) - solve swindles by the use of forged bonds.
Disk 3: Charlie Chan in Egypt (1935) - solve the case of stolen archeological treasures.
Disk 4: Charlie Chan in Shanghai (1935) - investigates opium smuggling.

This set with Warner Oland as the most serious Charlie Chan is as different from Sidney Toler's version as Dean was from Jerry.  Oland was the first successful Chan role, produced by 20th Century-Fox, after two Japanese and one Korean actor prior to him appeared in three different box office flops  Both Orland and Toler's versions are good and the story lines similar.  The Chan films, all very successful at the box office, were said to have kept the studio in business through the Great Depression.

Technophiles may notice a difference in the production values due to different studios, budgets, or producers.  But for just entertainment all of the Chan actors are good including the third, Roland Winter who played the detective in the last six films, which were all produced by Monogram Studios.",1452211200,,856,4.951048951048951

2543225,5,B000EXDSAW,"I think I have almost all of the Charlie Chan movies by Warner Oland and Sidney Toler.  There always neat twist and turns involved in solving the mysteries, and who better to solve them but, Charlie Chan.  He is portrayed as being a patient, all-observing sleuth who has the knack of being able to use the slightest of clues to help guide the direction of his investigation.  I recommend all of the Charlie Chan movies, many of which are found in five volumes.  I also recommend the Sherlock Holmes mysteries with Basil Rathbone playing the part of Holmes.  Recently, I saw a couple of Mr. Wong"" mysteries with Boris Karloff playing the part of Mr. Wong, the sleuth.

2543242,5,B000EXDSAW,"I have updated this review and changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  I just got re-interested in Charlie Chan films.  I watched them on TV in the 1950s and 60s.  If a Chan film was on I would not miss it, there is something about them that attracts me, even the ones with mediocre plots and bad supporting casts.  Some of the films are great and others were mediocre but I would watch them all.  I was not fond of the comic relief by either the ""number"" sons (and daughters), Stepin Fetchit, Mantan Moreland or Willie Best but they were tolerated.  I did enjoy Keye Luke when he was not used for comic relief, he is a good actor.  I do not feel that these films needed the comic relief especially since they are only 60 - 70 minutes long but studios may have felt different.  They probably cast Mantan Moreland to bring in more African American audiences members but I think his talent was misused as most of the time his parts called for him to be scared and yell ""Mr. Chan, Mr. Chan"".
I am a late comer to these Fox sets and I have to say they are very good and enjoyable.  I can watch an entire film without commercials and the ever present splices and noise on the old TV prints.  The restorations are not perfect but they did a really nice job.  These are general restorations that help clean up the pictures and sound and I have not seen a CC film in this good a condition on TV or other DVDs.  Some reviewers complain that the restorations could have been better...YES, but these restorations have eliminated the POPS, clicks, tears, waves (from warped film)and the annoying ""bounce"" or ""shimmy"" caused by worn sprocket holes.  A GOOD deal in my book.
With the Warner's release of 4 Chan films coming we are still waiting for 3 Chan pictures to be ""Officially"" released on DVD and we may never see them unless some studio thinks it is worth their while to clean them up and release them.  Warner's may do it depending on how the new set of Chan films being released August 2013 does in pre-orders.",1372982400,,2004,4.337801608579088

2543247,4,B000EXDSAW,"There's no such thing as a ""Charlie Chan fan"". There are fans of Warner Oland and there are fans of Sidney Toler. No one that I know of is a fan of both. Me? I'm a Warner Oland fan from way back. This Cinema Clasics collection is superb! It's classic Charlie Chan. Yes, the production values are limited by today's standards, the scripts are corny and no one, save Charlie himself, ever knows ""who-done-it"" until the very end. Nope, not Sherlock Homes - this is Charlie Chan.

The collection I purchased includes the basics: London, Paris, Egypt and Shanghai. Want to see the greats before they were even pretty good? ""London"" has Ray Milland. ""Egypt""  has Stephin Fetchit (Note: For the Politically Correct, Stephin Fetchit was mocking the White stereotype of Blacks, not participating in it. Grow up for Heaven's sake!). ""Shanghai"" co-stars Keye Luke as ""Number 2 son"". Yes, I too would have liked to see a Han play Charlie but, given the times, we have to take what we could get.

All in all, this collection is not only worth having, it is a elegant piece of early American film making at its ""very good"" if not its ""best"". Buy a set and enjoy how life was when folks had a sense of humor and not everything had to have a political message.",1363564800,5,1244,4.52

2543274,5,B000EXDSAW,"This four-movie collection shows the first four Charlie Chan films starring Warner Oland.  According to the blurb with the disks, these were the first four made beyond what Earl Derr Biggers, Charlie Chan's creator, had done.  The additions on these disks tell the story of the REAL Charlie Chan who was actually a policeman in Honolulu back at the turn of the twentieth century.  They even tell you his real name, Chang Apana,even though he eventually earned the nickname Charlie Chan.
In reality, he didn't look anything like Warner Oland's characterization.  Still, though, Warner Oland and Mr. Biggers were the best of friends and it's said that Oland and Biggers looked a lot alike.  Some people, hiding behind the facade of ""political Correctness,"" object to what they say is the pidgin English used by Chan.  If these people would extract their heads from their rectums, they would realize that English was not Charlie's native tongue, and that what he was doing was translating his thoughts in Chinese into their English equivalents, as best as he could.
I have always liked the character Charlie Chan and when I was a kid back in the forties, me and my friends would play at being him, complete with Chan-like aphorisms and his well-know tag line, ""Thank you, so much.""  To be perfectly honest, I still love these old, very politically incorrect films very much.  I do highly recommend these sets to anyone who does, as well.  And to those of you who have read this review to this point, I say, ""Thank you, so much!""",1356998400,2,1525,4.790076335877862

2543277,5,B000EXDSAW,"Once Fox's biggest guaranteed moneymakers, many of the studio's Charlie Chan films are now lost, while those that survive have been hard to find since political correctness has kept them off TV. The latter charge is particularly curious because, while the series typically used Western actors for its Chinese detective, the almost apologetic Chan is consistently the smartest guy in the room and regularly outwits the Westerners who consistently underestimate him.

""Front seldom tell truth. To know occupants of house, always look in backyard.""

The first in Fox's expensively restored series of classic Warner Oland Charlie Chan films to be released on DVD, 1934's Charlie Chan in London spends little of its running time in London, quickly shifting the action to a country house where Chan has three days to prove the innocence of a condemned man by finding the real killer. Luckily they're all assembled for the last fox hunt of the season and it's not long before suspects are found dead and someone's trying to arrange for Chan to join them. It's slick production line fare that hits all the expected notes satisfactorily, benefiting from a decent supporting cast including Alan Mowbray as the lord of the manor and a young Raymond Milland as the condemned man's lawyer who rather mucks up his engagement to his sister by letting it slip he actually thinks he's guilty. Few surprises, but done well enough for it not to matter a bit and a partial inspiration for Gosford Park, which even gives it and Mowbray a namecheck in the script.

The featurette included on the DVD, The Legacy of Charlie Chan, does address the way the Chan films were interpreted in later years, pointing out that at the time they helped slowly chip away at some racial barriers even while creating something of a stereotype in the process. The original theatrical trailer is also included.

""Many strange crimes committed in sewers of Paris.""

Charlie Chan in Paris sees the Honolulu detective stopping over in the city of lights having solved the Stable Murder Case in his previous adventure, and it's next to no time before the bodies are piling up. But it's not a murder investigation that takes him to France or even the vacation he pretends but a bank bond scandal that needs to be investigated on the quiet, and this time his number one son (Keye Luke) is also in town to help him. Unlike Charlie Chan in London, Chan actually spends the whole running time in the capital city, though he avoids most of the usual tourist haunts for its banks and its sewers, with only a brief stop off in a nightclub for a violent dance number with a rather more violent climax than was intended by the lady's dance partner. It's a thoroughly entertaining number, with the usual aphorisms - ""Optimist see only donut: pessimist see hole,"" ""Joy in heart more desirable than bullet"" - false accusations, attempts on his life and dastardly deeds delivered in a snappy 71 minutes, as well as a polite rejoinder to one character's use of pidgin English when meeting Chan for the first time.

Also included is documentary featurette In Search of Charlie Chan and the trailer for Charlie Chan in London.

""Cannot believe that piece of carved stone contain evil - unless dropped on foot.""

Despite being directed with surprising visual flair by Louis King and boasting a plot built around the opening of a tomb and the disposal of some of its treasures that adds a bit of supernatural spice to proceedings for the first time, Charlie Chan in Egypt never quite hits the highs. It's a perfectly decent mystery that benefits from what looks like much higher production values, though it also flirts much more with casual xenophobia and racial stereotyping, be it the duplicitous local guides or Stepin Fetchit's shtick as the lazy and cowardly black servant `Snowshoes.' On the plus side, the supporting cast also includes Rita Cansino in the days before she changed her name to Rita Hayworth in a thankless role as a native servant girl, but you'd never guess from the scant evidence here that she'd blossom into a major beauty and a major star. The credits have obviously been remade for DVD, presumably because of the limited material available on all the early Chan films, though the disc does include a fascinating documentary about Chang Apana, the real Chinese detective in Honolulu who was the model for Chan - a svelte, two-fisted type who carried the sickle and knife scars from the many fights he never walked away from!

""Beauty of poppy contains sting of death.""

Charlie Chan in Shanghai sees a noticeable increase in production values for the series, with the detective and his Number One son finding themselves mixed up with secret agents, kidnappers and opium rings a bit closer to their ancestral home. It's a fairly lavish picture, with a much wider scope than previous entries. The murder of one of Chan's old friends almost seems less important than smashing the drug smugglers here, the investigation initially seeming more of a trigger for the plot than its focus, and daring escapes, assassination attempts and even a shootout assume as much prominence as detection. There's also some surprising violence, not least from an America intelligence man who gets his confessions with his fists

Thankfully the racial stereotyping that makes parts of his previous adventure in Egypt so uncomfortable to watch today is not an issue here. True, Charlie does sing a cheerful song about Fu Manchu to some children and the positions of authority are all represented by British or Americans, but nonetheless the Chinese characters are never belittled - though Key Luke's Number One son is on the receiving end of several rebukes for running up a hefty bill on his father's hotel telephone. All in all it's a rather nifty and enjoyable 70 minutes that manages to throw in a couple of minor surprises along the way.

The film which really kicked off Fox's Charlie Chan series and introduced Warner Oland in the role, Charlie Chan Carries On, is now lost, but a Spanish-language version filmed at the same time on the same sets with a different cast in the days before dubbing still survives. Eran Trece aka They Were Thirteen has a decent hook: a series of murders among a group of well-off tourists touring the world where the police know the name of the murderer - or at least his real name - but don't know what he looks like. Unfortunately it takes almost as long to get going as it does for Chan to make his appearance, the first half of the film entrusted to the capable hands of Rafael Calvo's Inspector Duff, who constantly talks about his friend Charlie Chan while he's faced with the usual assortment of suspects and potential victims - a theatrical impresario, a pompous doctor, a compulsive liar, a Chicago gangster with a penchant for musical impersonations and his wife, an elderly man with a heart condition and his young companion, a rich young heiress, a spinster and a lumber merchant among them. Although it's decently staged the film spends far too long introducing the suspects in their London hotel after the first killing and, if not quite creaks, certainly threatens to lose your interest.

Things pick up when the film starts to follow the tourists rather than the detective - at least it gets them out of the hotel - but it's not until the halfway point that the Inspector finds himself on the wrong end of the killer's gun and Charlie Chan takes over the case. It's almost a pity to see the Inspector go, because Manuel Arbo's Chan isn't terribly impressive, giving the kind of performance that would usually be relegated to minor comic relief and really overplaying the epigrams (""Every `maybe' has a wife called `maybe not,'"" ""A big head is no more than a place for a big headache""), though Raoul Roulien's gangster does get a good retort when Chan tells him he doesn't drink: ""Okay, you can listen to the cork pop and imagine you're chasing bandit."" Included on the Region 1 NTSC DVD of Charlie Chan in Shanghai as an extra, it's an okay studio mystery that at least offers a tantalising glimpse of what its lost American big brother was like.",1345507200,2,8141,4.8064285714285715

2543294,5,B000EXDSAW,"Warner Oland (1879-1938) is best known for his 16 films as Charlie Chan, starting in 1931 following his success in ""The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu"" (1929) and the two sequels. Interestingly enough he was Swedish (and claimed to have Russian and a ""dollop"" of Asian blood). He first appeared as an oriental villain in 1919 with sights on Peal White in ""The Lightning Raider"". He also played an Oriental villain in ""Shanghai Express"" (1932) opposite Marlene Dietrich, and an Oriental botanist in ""Werewolf in London"" (1935), but he wasn't limited to Orientals and played Al Jolson's Jewish father in ""The Jazz Singer"" (1927).

FWIW - If you think a Swedish Catholic playing a Jewish rabbi (much less an Oriental detective) is strange, remember that in ""The Jazz Singer"" a Jewish comedian plays a black singer. Prior to the 30s (and even after that) most ethnics were played by whites (e.g., ""Birth of a Nation"", ""Last of the Mohicans"").

The Charlie Chan character was invented in 1923 by novelist Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933), who adapted him from a real life Hawaiian detective Chang Apana (Interested fans should read Yunte Huang 2010 book ""Charlie Chan"" for a full discussion). Diggers wrote 6 novels between 1923 and 1932, and they were all best sellers. As a result, films about Charlie Chan appeared as early as 1926 (""The House Without a Key"" - his first book), but the first few films (which featured Japanese and Korean actors playing the Chinese Chan) were not successful.

When Oland died in 1938 while making ""Charlie Chan at the Ringside"" his character was replaced by Peter Lorre and the footage turned into ""Mr. Moto's Gamble"", part of another oriental detective series about the fictional Japanese detective featured in the Saturday Evening Post. Lorre made 8 ""Mr. Moto"" films between 1937 and 1939 when WW 2 made Japanese heroes anathema.

With Oland dead, Fox hired another Caucasian, Sidney Toler, to play Chan, and they made 11 more films from 1938 to 1942. Fox sold their rights to the character and Monogram produced 11 more Chan films from 1944 to 1946 when he died.

Charlie Chan's #1 son was played by Chinese actor Keye Luke (1904-1991) in 6 of the Oland films. We know Luke best from the TV series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-5) in which he played Master Po (the blind Priest). Luke did more than 100 films and as many TV shows. But Luke declined to continue with the Chan series after Oland died, so this gave birth to Chan's #2 son, Sen Yung (1915-80), who played in all the 11 Sidney Toler films. Yung continued with the next Chan (Roland Winters) for 5 more films, but changed his name from Jimmy to Tommy. In addition to the Chan films, Sen Yung is probably best remembered as the cook Hop Sing, from the TV series ""Bonanza""  (1959-73).

In all, there were 47 Charlie Chan films between 1926 and 1949, not counting the foreign language versions. All this from 6 novels because in 1934, following Biggers death, his wife sold the rights to the character to Fox. In 1956-7 there was a TV series starring J. Carrol Naish and in the 1970s Hanna-Barbera produced an animated series ""The Amazing Chan"" and Keye Luke provided the voice of Chan.

This Fox collection has the 5th through 8th of the Oland Chan series, produced in 1934-5. Instead of keeping Chan in his native Hawaii, Fox has Chan travelling the world. In the mid 30s, audiences were very interested in international events. After all, in 1933 Hitler was elected in Germany and the Reichstag caught fire, Japan and Germany left the League of Nations, Mohandas Gandhi was on a much publicized hunger strike in India and then jailed, and Wiley Post became the first person to fly solo around the world. In 1934 when the first of these films appeared, there was an attempted coup in France, the Austrian Civil War began, Belgium got a new king, the Prince of Sweden lost his throne, Russia joined the League of Nations, natural disasters killed thousands in Japan, Mao's ""long march"" began in China, Stalin begins his purges, and Ethiopian and Italians exchange gunfire in Abyssinia.

Films reflected the international arena. 1933 saw ""King Kong"", ""Queen Christina"", ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"", ""Sons of the Desert"", and ""Flying Down to Rio"".  1934 saw ""Viva Villa"", ""Cleopatra"" and ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"".

All these Warner Chan films in this collection were original screenplays based on the Chan character. Only Fox's first Chan film, ""The Black Camel"" (1929) was based on a Biggers novel. Two of the 4 films (London, Paris) were written by Philip MacDonald (1900-80) who is better known for his work on ""The Lost Patrol"" (1934) and ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935). All four films have different directors. The LA Times noted ""Being of a simple story structure and dealing with elemental emotions, the films are quickly made, shot into the market, and generally are well received at the box office.""

Of the 4 films, ""Egypt"" is probably the most interesting (and controversial). It has a young Rita Haworth and filmdom's first major black actor, Stepin Fetchit (1902-1985). This was Fetchit's only Chan film. Mantan Moreland (1902-73) joined the series in 1944 and continued until 1949.

2543311,5,B000EXDSAW,"You could almost feel the gentle trade winds of Hawaii during the 1920's in the first Charlie Chan novel by Earl Derr Biggers. Romantic and full of atmosphere, Biggers was always a great romance writer who simply incorporated mystery into his books to propel the story forward. His detective was wise and humorous, his take on American life sometimes a riot. Nothing got by Chan, however, and it was his intelligence which always brought about justice in the end.

The adaptations to film lost some of the more romantic aspects of the early Chan novels, centering more on Chan as a detective, which was to be expected. Enough humor and atmosphere remained, however, to propel Chan into the top tier of film detectives. Warner Oland's Chan was more refined and subtle, Sidney Toler's more outgoing and amused. Both were excellent. This first set features Warner Oland in the role with which he will most likely be forever identified.

Fox liked to put Chan in exotic locations and settings. Charlie was in London, or Paris, or maybe somewhere more exotic, such as Egypt or Shanghai. One of his many offspring would often gum up the works in their energetic attempts to play detective and help out their Pop. These first entries are excellent, Oland's portrayal very dignified yet with a charm and humor just beneath the surface.

CHARLIE CHAN IN EGYPT

This potpourri of Egypt, ancient excavations with curses attached, murder and Charlie Chan has an aroma of fun that never wavers for the entire seventy-two minute running time. For film buffs, it is a chance to see lovely Pat Paterson onscreen also. Louis King directed the screenplay of Robert Ellis and Helen Logan. Rita Hayworth fans will enjoy her small early role as Nayda. The pace is perfect, the mystery and romance blended nicely by King.

Though Toler is probably my favorite of the two Chans, taking over the role in 1938 when Oland fell ill and succumbed to pneumonia in his country of birth, Sweden, Oland was excellent, lending class and an air of distinction to Chan. Charlie Chan in Egypt is one of Oland's most fun turns as the famous sleuth. It starts off with a bang, in something resembling a scene from The Mummy; a man dropping dead during the unearthing of an ancient Egyptian room full of artifacts. A figure watching over the room may be bringing a curse upon those who've disturbed the site. Chan is sent by the French Museum to discover why various artifacts excavated are finding their way into private hands instead of theirs.

More is amiss than just the missing artifacts, however, as Charlie soon discovers. Archeologist Tom Evans (Thomas Beck) proves to be his ally with many mysteries. Evans is sweet on Carol Arnold (Pat Paterson), the daughter of the expedition leader, now missing. It isn't long until Charlie discovers his body in an Egyptian sarcophagus, and knows there is a murderer about, helping the curse come true. Tom and Carol have romantic feelings for one another, of course, and Chan is disturbed by her bouts of illness which he suspects also have a very earthly cause. A second death soon transpires, and Chan's reputation is in doubt for a short time.

Thanks to our favorite Hawaiian detective, Carol is no longer under the spell of the poison she was being given, which proves handy when Tom is shot helping Charlie find a killer's secret. Chan appears to be defeated but, of course, is only setting a trap. There is a bit of misdirection which will have the viewer suspecting everyone except the scared Snowshoes (Stepinfetchit) who wants nothing to do with curses and murder. A very nice ending wraps up both the mystery and the romance in this one. Fox gave this one a big boost with some fine sets, lending a fun atmosphere to a tight little mystery with just the right amount of romance.

The romance between Beck and Paterson is quite nice, Beck making a solid romantic hero. Paterson is lovely here, and a big plus for film buffs. She married Charles Boyer on Valentine's Day in 1934, and when she died in 1978, Boyer took his own two days later, unable and unwilling to live without her. A fun film and excellent Charlie Chan entry with a sweet reminder of love the way it is supposed to be for those who know the story.

CHARLIE CHAN IN LONDON

""Not great detective. Just lucky old Chinaman."" -- Charlie Chan

Charlie mingles with the fox hunting crowd in this enjoyable entry in the Chan franchise. A good story from Philip Macdonald keeps us guessing in this one, making up for a somewhat languid pace. Warner Oland's quiet and dignified portrayel of Earl Derr Bigger's famous detective works nicely here. A nice cast which includes Alan Mowbray, Drue Leyton, Mona Barrie, and a young Ray Milland surround the Hawaiian sleuth but, as always, the most fun is derived from watching Chan spout famous words of wisdom while solving the mystery.

Charlie is about to leave London and head back to his large family in Honolulu when pretty Pamela Gray (Drue Leyton), distraught and desperate for help, convinces him to find a real murderer before her brother is hung for a crime he did not commit. Even her fiance who defended him in court, Neil Howard (Ray Milland), isn't convinced he's innocent, but Charlie heads to the country and soon suspects all is not right. Alan Mowbray and Mona Barrie hang around as Geoffrey Richmond and his fiancee, Mary Bristol, while Chan reconstructs the original crime, which prompts a second deadly encounter.

Someone makes an attempt on Charle's life that nearly succeeds, and a third murder almost occurs when Mary realizes she may have seen something which will help our favorite detective. He's soon on the trail of stolen war plans and sets a trap for the murderer, a few surprises from the rest of the household finding their way to the surface at the same time. A fun epilog as Charlie turns his attention to solving romantic troubles rather than crime end this one on a high note, making it worth the trip.

CHARLIE CHAN IN PARIS

""Kindness in heart better than gold in bank."" -- Charlie Chan

Mystery writer Philip Macdonald penned some nifty little stories for the screen during the 1930's and our favorite sleuth from Honolulu is the center of this one. Warner Oland brought a sense of dignity and just a touch of humor to the detective created by Earl Derr Biggers in these early Charlie Chan features. Charlie is in Paris this time, attempting to discreetly discover who has been forging bank bonds and avoid a public scandal. Nardi (Dorothy Appleby) is the lovely chanteuse who has been assisting him. Before Charlie can hook up with her and get vital information on the case, however, she takes a knife and a saddened Charlie works overtime to find her killer.

Mary Brian has a nice role as Yvette, endeavoring to get letters written most foolishly away from a blackmailer and ending up charged with murder. Charlie and her fiance hook up in the seamy side of Paris to hunt down a disguised killer and clear her. There is a lot of atmosphere in this tight little mystery from Philip Macdonald, the search through the Paris sewers near the conclusion especially fun. A trick by Charlie catches not one killer, but two, with Keye Luke's first appearance as Lee Chan coming in quite handy.

There are some nice sets in this one, and a cast which also includes Thomas Beck and Erik Rhodes lend nice support to Brian and Appleby. Oland is particularly good in this entry. While I might prefer the Toland years as Chan, I very much like what Oland first brought to the role, and Charlie Chan in Paris is a splendid example of what a good mystery story can be in the right hands. A lot of fun for fans.

CHARLIE CHAN IN SHANGHAI

This entry in the Charlie Chan franchise boasts an attractive cast and  nice settings, in addition to a good story. Swedish born Warner Oland is right at home now as Earl Derr Biggers' detective, with young Keye Luke establishing with charm the continuing efforts of his offspring to help ""pop"" and play detective too. Number one son Lee (Keye Luke) has plenty of opportunity to do just that with Charlie on the heels of an opium smuggling ring in 1930's Shanghai. The accent is a bit more on the action side in some moments, the humor derived from Charlie's reigning in of young Lee's love life via his phone.

Charlie no sooner arrives by boat when a man named Woodland with important information for him is cleverly slain. His niece Diana (Irene Hervey) has romantic thoughts for young Philip Nash (Charles Locher) who quickly finds himself the chief suspect when a second attempt is made on Chan's life. It seems Woodland was a British Agent who had discovered too much. His American counterpart arrives but things get no clearer when Charlie and Lee are briefly kidnapped. Charlie takes nothing at face value, of course, and enlists two innocents in order to ferret out the ringleader.

Charm, an exotic atmosphere, and the fine cast of players surrounding Warner Oland and Keye Luke Fox put together elevate this entry to a most excellent status. Like Biggers, his literary creation, Charlie Chan, could be quite the romantic where youthful love was concerned. The detective from Hawaii had many children of his own, and nearly always helped the struggling young couple find true love at the end of the mystery. Charlie Chan in Shanghai is no exception. A very nice time at the movies.

Charlie Chan was bright and funny, and audiences loved him. If anything, his character helped elevate and give distinction to the perspective at the time of Chan's race in general. These were fun mysteries with great appeal; so much so, that we are still watching and talking about them today.

2543321,4,B000EXDSAW,"In my youth when local TV used to show these pictures on ""Charlie Chan Theater"" they would jump around in the series' timeline.  Watching these now in order, it's suprising to see how sturdy the early productions were as some of the later are pretty threadbare.  The London entry here is especially lavish for the series.  (By the time we get to Shanghai though, there's little effort expended to suggest local color and it's the least atmospheric.)  The London picture also highlights Chan's race more than the others.  By giving that film a non-American setting the filmmakers are able to lampoon racist treatment of the detective without ever suggesting these attitudes might be abroad among the audience itself.  (Also, the silly drunk character in London is actually pretty funny.)

I prefer the straightforward whodunits more than the stories where Charlie is a kind of secret agent at large.  The main drawback to the series is that Warner Orland is such a benign, nonthreatening figure that he's almost a cipher.  It's always startling to see the large line of his kids as he's such a tame asexual presence.

In some ways the best picture here is the crazy Spanish language feature that doesn't introduce Chan 'til the final third and where all the clues introduced are red herrings that in no way relate to how the crime is solved.  Instead, we get a riotous party atmosphere with the suspects on a world tour played by a very energetic cast that is highly entertaining.

Given the number of academics and critics who were interviewed, I can't see why the documentaries on the set are so short, agreeable and informative as they are.",1220054400,,1642,4.825
2543322,5,B000EXDSAW,Good quality DVD's.  If you like Charlie Chan you must have the entire set.  Would recommend to a friend.,1207353600,,105,4.473684210526316
2543323,4,B000EXDSAW,"Charlie Chan in London is one my favorite movies in the series. The opening grips you when you discover that a young man is about to be executed for a murder he claims he didn't commit. Only his sister believes in his innocence, and all avenues of escape seem closed after the Home Secretary turns down her appeal. But she begs Charlie Chan to see what can be done in the remaining three days.

Charlie is about to leave London but changes his plans to help the young people. Arriving at an English country manor, Charlie must examine the setting to find out what really happened. Only by finding the real killer can the young man be saved.

It all looks pretty bleak until Charlie re-creates the crime and begins to pick up clues. A rattled murderer soon begins making mistakes.

The mystery is a hard one to solve, and you won't identify the killer much before Charlie does. The continual tolling of time adds real suspense and drama to the investigation.

One of the strengths of this movie is that excellent character actors are allowed to steal scenes, in the best tradition of 30's movies: A supercilious and suspicious butler wants to keep Charlie out of the house; a drunk and his wife provide humorous by plays making fun of English pretentiousness; and a not-too-bright police detective has trouble with Charlie's name and following what Charlie tells him.

Drue Leyton is solid in the role of Pamela Gray, sister of the accused man. Her leading man, Ray Milland, is somewhat weak in his role . . . not yet having developed into the suave, assured actor he later became. But it's fun to see Milland as a young actor.

The setting is well done. With one exception (driving in a car with the steering wheel on the left), all the settings ring true for being in England. Especially good for local color is a fox hunt complete with full kit, dogs, and a fox.

If you watched this movie as a youngster as I did, I'm sure it will also provide some nostalgia by helping you remember how you reacted to the movie the first time you saw it.

Charlie Chan movies are an acquired taste. I'm assuming that you have that taste or you wouldn't be looking at this review of the video of Charlie Chan in Paris.

I hadn't seen this movie in over 30 years, and I was curious to see if my obsession with Charlie Chan had survived. I must report that I'm still hooked.

Why? The plot is extremely compact, complex, and well developed. Even knowing who did what to whom, I was fascinated to see the story unfold.

I expected to be bothered by the treatment of Charlie as a Chinese American, but that was handled with reasonable aplomb. Charlie is obviously the smartest guy in the room, and everyone figures that out pretty quickly. Once they know him, they all love Charlie. There's one scene early on where Charlie is patronized by a new acquaintance, but he handles it all with grace. The rest of the time, Charlie receives the kind of treatment that a detective king might command. Warner Oland graciously takes it all as his due.

Those who love Keye Luke who played Lee Chan in the series will be pleased to see that he has a good sized role in Charlie Chan in Paris.

Those who love Apache dancing will enjoy that scene.

What really shocked me was how poorly the film represented Paris. Aside from some French names and a pair of Apache dancers, no one in the film seems to be French. The effort is most amateurish except for an interesting trip through the Paris sewers which is rigged with an unexpected gag.

Charlie Chan in Egypt is based on an original screen play so don't look back into any of the Earl Derr Biggers' novels for insights into this plot. This film is one of the last ones done by Warner Oland, the original actor who portrayed Charlie Chan. In this movie, the studio was obviously trying to tell a good story without spending much money. The result is surprisingly good.

Having not seen this movie for many years, I was concerned when I saw that Stepin Fetchit was in the cast. Although the role certainly plays on stereotypes about African-Americans (laziness, fearfulness, and drunkenness), the effect wasn't nearly as bad as I feared from some of the other movies in the series where Chinese stereotypes are much too deeply reinforced. Stepin Fetchit comes across more like a reasonable man who is put upon by foolish employers than as an ex-slave who cringes at the sight of a white man.

The strength of the movie comes in the excellent atmosphere created by visiting an Egyptian crypt and a professor's laboratory inside a darkness-shrouded house. There's a heavy mood of danger and dread that infects the actors and the story. You'll get hints of curses, crooks, and obsession. The atmosphere is superbly set in context by having Charlie arrive by plane and taking a barn-storming tour over the Sphinx and major pyramids.

Like the best of the Charlie Chan stories, this film has some excellent science involved to help explain the mysteries and murders.

An unexpected treat is to have the young Rita Hayworth (playing under the name of Rita Cansino) decoratively walking across the rooms in an attractive native costume. Although no one will mistake her for an Egyptian, she certainly adds to the scenery.

The film's main weakness is that the identity of the murderer is pretty easy to figure out.

The DVD also has a short feature on an exemplary Chinese-Hawaiian detective in Honolulu who was operating there when Earl Derr Biggers visited the islands. Biggers probably got the idea for having a Chinese detective from this man, but little else seems to have been based on the real detective who mostly worked on drug and gambling cases in the Chinese community and was famous for carrying a bull whip to enforce the law.

Charlie Chan in Shanghai has one of my favorite opening scenes in the series. A group of young children are playing leapfrog on a liner deck. The camera slow pans back to reveal that Charlie Chan is folded over on the deck waiting for the youngsters to leap over him.

From that playful interlude, the mood soon darkens as a stranger slips a note into Charlie's pocket warning him not to get off the ship in Shanghai. Naturally, Charlie isn't perturbed . . . until threatened by the thought of having to make a speech at a welcoming dinner in his honor that night.

At the dinner, his local contact leans over to tell Charlie that he has important news to share. They agree to meet after the event. But death intrudes. Charlie doesn't know where to go next because his contact had not alerted him to what the issue was that summon Charlie to Shanghai.

Charlie begins investigating the murder on his own and seems to have ruffled more feathers. With quick wits he escapes from a kidnapping.

Much humor is supplied by the presence of eldest son, Lee Chan, played by Keye Luke, who repeatedly slows down progress by hogging the telephone with his girl friend. The other gags involve Lee dressing as a beggar and conducting surveillance on Charlie's behalf.

Eventually, Charlie realizes that he's up against an opium-smuggling ring and starts to track the ring down through the men who kidnapped him.

The ending is full of suspense and action.

Part of the fun of this story is that Charlie gets a chance to speak Chinese and to be on home turf compared to the Europeans and Americans who are doing business in China. It would be great fun to see a remake of this movie, updated for today's China. Presumably, the smuggling would involve pirated copies of Microsoft programs instead of opium.

The plot is a little on the light side, and the mystery isn't quite mysterious enough to be completely satisfying. But all Charlie Chan buffs will be glad to see this movie.",1206921600,4,7722,4.619430241051862

2543340,4,B000EXDSAW,"After watching these movies,you will be coming up with alot of Chan aphorisms like that one...but probably much,much better!
This box set includes:
CHARLIE CHAN IN LONDON,CHARLIE CHAN IN PARIS,CHARLIE CHAN IN EGYPT,CHARLIE CHAN IN SHANGHAI and ERAN TRECE(Spanish w/ English subtitles)/""Charlie Chan Carries On"").The latter film does not include Warner Oland in the lead but it is an interesting look at what might have been. Unfortunately the original English version has been lost,along with three other Oland Chans.
I haven't seen any of these films in at least 50 years but they have lost none of their charm and heart and that is in BIG part to Warner Oland himself. I have seen Oland,Toler and Winters each playing the famous detective. In my oppinion the latter two just tried hard to imitate Oland but fell far short of the mark. They didn't have the dignity,heart,warmth nor  comportment the way Oland did. In fact I have seen very few actors immerse themselves in their characters as much as he did. I would even dare say that after a time the two almost became inseperable. I know relatively little of Warner Oland's career except that I know he had played Oriental parts in previous years and that there was at one stage a walk off of a film set by the actor and then his eventual return to Sweden. He was having personal problems,alot of it brought on by alcohol. By today's standards one might say he was burned out. In the end he never returned and died in his homeland. Tragic,for his family and the public,as we lost a very talented man that day in 1938.
I recall reading but never finishing a Derr Biggers Charlie Chan novel. The reason? I had watched a couple of Oland Chan's before hand. Big mistake. I found the character in the books to be different than the on screen character fleshed out with such panache by Oland. It is one of the few times I have committed the literary sin of preferring the movie over the book. That is the impact Oland had on me and that impact has only been heightened considerably with the release of this and the other Oland Chan
films by Fox.
Each film has been transferred over to DVD using the best available source material on hand at Fox. There is a definite difference in the quality from one film to the next but the age of one particular film compared to another matters little. As I said it's the quality of the material on hand which makes it or breaks it. Some are very clean and crisp while others are quite grainy. However ALL are visually quite clear.
Fox seems to have done the best they can with what they have. Also,as I mentioned earlier, four versions are seemingly lost so we should be thankful to at least have these films.
Finally all these sets come with many featurettes that are sure to delight even the most casual Chan fan. As is my practice I have not seen them yet but I am looking forward to viewing them all at a later time.
In conclusion I highly recommmend these Warner Oland Charlie Chan box sets to one and all. They are a must have for all Charlie Chan fans and for those who have never seen them I will tell you that you are in for a special treat. And for those curious enough to want to see the later Chan actors to compare I would advise you to rent if you can. If not possible just buy one or two and see how you like them. But I think it will become apparent very quickly that THESE Chans with the magnificent and talented Warner Oland will become,like me,your favourites too!",1201478400,9,3467,4.468454258675079

I found it interesting that several of the movies managed to work in some of the cutting edge technology of the day.  i.e. The photocell timing at the race track, the FAX-like transmission of pictures.

2543359,4,B000EXDSAW,"Earl Derr Bigger's Charlie Chan was finally successfully brought to the screen by Warner Oland.  This box set has Oland's 5th - 8th appearances as the detective.  This set could be called Charlie Chan's world tour as he visits London, Paris, Cairo and Shanghai.

Like all detective serial movies, the plots are all different but they are all the same.  Its just that Charlie has a classy way of doing things.  He always does things with intelligence and style.  Whether solving a case at an English country house, finding who has been forging bank bonds in Paris, who has been stealing the treasure from the tomb in Egypt or the murderer in Shanghai, Charlie / Warner always got his man.

But what makes this set special is are the special features.  Three of the movies have featurettes about the origins of Charlie Chan and each is very interesting and gives great insight into the character.

The forth has a spanish language version of Charlie Chan Carries On.  In the 30's the studios would make duplicate versions of movies for the foriegn markets, usually South America.  These were made using the same sets as the English versions but with a Spanish cast.  In this film they use a photo of Charlie's family but Oland is in the picture not the Spanish actor! (If you get Garbo's Anna Christie, it has the German version with Garbo but the rest of the cast replaced by German actors.)

FOX could have put Vol 1 and 2 into one set perhaps with a lesser expensive packaging considering none of these movies run more than a little more than 70 minutes each. FOX did include some featurettes and trailers but the packaging offers little details into the movies (though each come in their own case). These short movies are intricately plotted and very easy to get hooked on and must be carefully watched for the subtle clues, otherwise you'll never solve the case watching these great flix. Charlie Chan was one of the most famous fictional non-caucasion sleuths and very popular during an era of distrust for the occidental ethnic group. Yet the movies always treated him very respectively (although there are a few ethic slaps here and there). The price is well worth it for the fan, but I found it far too expensive. I suppose with the money that FOX put out to restore these classic who-done-its, had to make up their costs. Vol I. is a companion set and CHANTHOLOGY is not the best of the WWII films with Sidney Toler.

However, when the films first ran on cable, there was a storm of protest from Asian groups.  They protested the fact that Charlie Chan was not portrayed by a Chinese actor (although other Chan family members were played by Asians)and that some of his mannerisms might be viewed as stereotypical.

In defense of these films, Charlie Chan was always the good guy and he always outsmarted his opponents.  The films must be viewed in the context of the era in which they were produced.  They were good clean fun.  No bloody violence on the screen!

I am happy that Fox had the courage to release these films on DVD.  The interest in them has been extraordinary.

There were two problems then, the reception was sporatic and the number of commercials runied any flow in the movies. It is truly a treat to watch these classics un-interupted for the first time. The actors are more theatrical then we find today, and the amount of drinking and smoking in those days as depicted in these movies makes one wonder how anything got done. This particular series has stories that are complex enough to keeps ones interest to the end and each character is fun to watch.

I would say overall the sound and print quality is quite good however I may be a bit biased as my only comparison is the TV as described above. My wife enjoys these movies on our MAC laptop on the bed some evenings when we are tired from long days at work. They aren't as long as a typical modern movie so we don't have to stay up too late.

He succeeds in creating a warm and admirable character whose unfailing elaborate politeness conceals a steeltrap mind and readiness to take action. One of the best attempts of a caucasian actor to portray a Chinese on the screen. Certainly the acting of few of the others that share the screen with Oland are on a par with his.

The films date from a time when the attitudes toward racial issues were vastly different from what they are today, which may make it difficult for them to be viewed with pleasure by everyone. It is wise to remember that at the time of their release the Charlie Chan films represented one the first attempts to bring a non-white hero before mainstream movie audiences.

2543385,5,B000EXDSAW,"Confucius Meets Sherlock Holmes

One of the cultural icons of the 1930s, in print and on screen, was Charlie Chan. As is well known, Chan's  creator, Earl Derr Biggers, based the figure upon a real Hawaiian detective,Chang Apana. But underneath the disguise we have no difficulty in detecting the features of Sherlock Holmes.  At a moment when Asian characters  frequently appeared in Western novels or stage plays as kowtowing houseboys or opium smoking fiends, Biggers showed real audacity  in coming up with his sleuth.

But he was tapping into another stereotype, that of China as a land of ancient wisdom populated by oracular mandarins, from whose golden tongues aphorisms from Confucius or Lao Tzu flew like plum blossoms in the spring wind. Charlie Chan is Sherlock Holmes as an Eastern sage. Chan is a man of impeccable dignity and aplomb, who has no bottles hidden in his desk drawers and no blondes lurking in his closet, and who solves crimes by superior skull skills, in the words of Churchy La Femme.

There had been a couple of attempts at transferring Chan to celluloid in the 1920s, but the series really geared up when Fox cast Warner Oland in the role in 1931. Oland, who had previously played Jackie Robin's father in The Jazz Singer and the sinister Dr. Fu Manchu in some early sound pictures at Paramount, was no great actor, but he made the role of Chan incontestably his own. It is just as impossible for anyone who has ever seen Oland as Chan to imagine another actor in the role as it is to imagine anyone other than Basil Rathbone playing Sherlock Holmes.

A number of the Oland-Chan pictures have been previously available in VHS format, but this DVD set is an absolute treat, indispensable for Chan fans and for devotees of studio filmmaking in the heyday of Hollywood. The set consists of four pictures starring Oland made from 1934-35, along with Eran Trece (They Were Thirteen), the 1931 Spanish language version of the no longer extant Charlie Chan Carries On. In addition, there are three quite informative and well-made short documentaries dealing with the origin of the Chan figure and its development, the production of the films, etc.

One mystery that might have baffled Chan himself is the omission of The Black Camel (1931) from the set. Photographed partly on location at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel and its environs, the movie boasts a cast that includes Bela Lugosi, Robert Young--in his first screen appearance--and Dwight Frye, albeit uncredited. I appreciate the inclusion of EranTrece, but it is mainly a curiosity, and inferior to The Black Camel. Fortunately, the latter film is not lost, and converts to the Chan cult can obtain an acceptable DVD copy of it from Sinister Cinema, which they will want to add to their collections.

All of the pictures in the set are quite entertaining if conventional thrillers set in foreign locales, Eran  Trece being the weakest of the lot, mainly owing to Oland's absence. Eran Trece uses a global cruise as background for a murder mystery, while Charlie Chan in London--with a very young Ray Milland--recounts Chan's efforts to free an innocent man facing execution. In Charlie Chan in Paris, the detective visits the City of Lights to clear up a bank fraud, and supplies one of the series' more memorable lines, when he says to a companion, ""Many strange crimes committed in the sewers of Paris,"" while gazing into some impenetrably murky subterranean waters.

Charlie Chan in Egypt centers upon the theft of relics from an Egyptian tomb, and Charlie Chan in Shanghai shows Chan breaking up a ring of opium dealers. Although these are all B productions, usually lacking well-known performers apart from Oland, Fox was a major studio, and the cinematography--honor to your memory, Joseph August, Ernest Palmer, Daniel Clark, and Barney McGill!--and set design are generally outstanding. The opening of the tomb at the beginning of Charlie Chan in Egypt, to cite one example, utterly puts to shame a comparable scene in The Mummy, when archaeologists unearth the tomb of Princess Anck-es-en-Amon.

Serious critics at the time would have dismissed the Chan movies as escapism; present day partisans of political correctness would have far harsher things to say. More than anything else, they are relics of a pre-World War II, pre-Cold War America that viewed the outside world with suspicion, if not necessarily hostility. They are not racist but outdated, so outdated that they have acquired the etiolated charm of a once stylish table lamp found moldering in the shadows of an antique store. To use a felicitous phrase of James Joyce's from Finnegan's Wake, they are ""Only the fadograph of a yestern scene,""

Most importantly, one of the motives that first brought paying customers into movie theaters burns brightly in all of these films: to transport viewers to hitherto unrevealed lands of excitement and mystery. In the old days, the dimming of the house lights and the opening of the curtains was always the promise of a revelation. For this reason, my favorite of the set is Charlie Chan in Egypt which plunged me into an Egypt of the 1930s hardly less fabulous than that of the pharaohs, mesmerized me with its luminous procession of black and white images, and entrapped me in a silver nitrate labyrinth cleverly fabricated by the Fox studio. On the veranda, I sipped a gin and tonic, while an overpowering odor of ancient incense filled my nostrils.

2543413,5,B000EXDSAW,"Honorable ancestors can rejoice-- two detective series from the inscrutable east have been preserved on DVD for our delight and delectation. Honorable Charlie Chan, the Chinese detective, and wily Mr. Moto, the Japanese detective, two of the stalwarts of the Fox film series, stand up surprisingly well after nearly 70 years.

Addressing the issue of inherent racism and stereotyping first, yes, these films present Asians as outsiders, very different and strange, but gifted with near superhuman powers of observation.  However, it must be admitted that these characters are a far cry from the black Stepin Fetchits and gay Franklin Pangborns of the same period. Asians would suffer greatly at the hands of Hollywood before, during and after the Second World War, but these products of the '30s are considerably more benign, than, say, the Fu Manchu series, presenting an Asian as an arch demon.

Twentieth Century Fox has released four of the earliest films from each of the series, and while they are, frankly, B-movies, they are surprisingly well-made and entertaining.  We follow Chan through London in the first, Paris in the second, Egypt in the third, and finally Shanghai, where the sleuth solves a variety of killings with patient observations and little interaction.  On the other hand, Mr. Moto, who must think fast, take a chance, be simply mysterious, and then allow a thank you, seems something more of a hands-on secret agent than just a detective. Moto actually kills people, usually in self defense, and uses a bundle of disguises and subterfuges to solve his cases, which usually point more to international conspiracies than merely murder.

It's interesting than Chan was played by Warner Oland, a Swedish actor, and Moto by Peter Lorre, a German actor. As vehicles, the Chans seem a little weaker; the Motos not only seem more tightly conceived and cast, but also have the good fortune to be all directed by the same man, Norman Foster, who was one of Orson Welles' directors. In both series, the usual suspects of Hollywood's stock character performers pop up with alarming regularity, and Fox's B-unit, churned out by Sol Wurtzel at the rate of twice a month for over a decade, seems somehow a cut above the similar units at Warners and Metro. While none of these films can be called examples of cinematic greatness, they each run roughly a very fast 70 minutes, are engaging and unpretentious.  To perhaps snag a bit of the dialogue from either series, we should bow slightly at the waist in the direction of Twentieth Century Fox and say, ""Thank you so much.""",1158105600,6,2584,4.967592592592593
2543414,5,B000EXDSAW,"Loosely basing the character the legendary police officer Chang Apana (1887-1933), author Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933) wrote the first Charlie Chan novel in 1925.  His novels, six in all, were immensely popular--and Hollywood soon bought the rights.  At least two silent films, which do not survive made; a third film, BEYOND THAT CURTAIN, reduced the character of Chan to a minor role.  In 1931, however, Fox studios hit the right mixture of mystery and comedy with CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON, and the result was an immensely popular series of forty-five films made over the course of two decades.  These films were staples of afternoon and late night television well into the 1970s, but as time passed pressure groups that considered them politically incorrect forced them from public view.

Even so, the Chan films commanded a large cult following, and the films gradually became widely available in various bootleg editions--so popular, in fact, that 20th Century Fox eventually saw the commercial possibilities.  THE CHARLIE CHAN COLLECTION VOLUME 1 is the result, and although it can be faulted in several ways, it is pretty much what Chan fans have dreamed of for the past decade.

The single greatest fault of the collection is its failure to include THE BLACK CAMEL, the earliest surviving Chan film to star Warner Oland, and one of the few Chan films directly based on an Earl Derr Biggers novel.  Although the films have been digitally remastered, and they are easily the best prints to come along in many, many years, the remaster is not ""full;"" it merely smooths away the worst of the scratches and artifacts.  And although the bonuses included are excellent, they are very scant.

Even so, this is Charlie Chan, and he hasn't looked this good in close to five decades.  All four films star Warner Oland--and some viewers may be surprised to find that Chan films were a breeding ground for talent, for a number of future stars cut their teeth in Chan films.  IN LONDON (1934) finds Chan investigating a murder among the horsey set--and co-stars a very young Ray Milland.  IN PARIS (1935; long thought to be a lost film in the series) concerns a bank scandal--and introduces Keye Luke as Chan's ""Number One Son.""  IN EGYPT (1935) finds Chan investing a series of murders amidst archeological digs--and features both a very young Rita Hayworth and the notorious Stepin Fetchit.  IN SHANGHAI (1935) finds Chan doing battle with smugglers--and returns Keye Luke to the mix.  The scripts are witty, the plots are flyweight but entertaining, and the casts always give a good performance.

Critics of the series complain that white actors played Chinese in ""yellowface"" make-up; that Chan speaks in pidgen English; that he is a stereotypical ""stupid Chinaman"" and that he is the butt of racial jokes.  These complaints, however, really have little basis in the films themselves.  Although he was European, Warner Oland had an Asian heritage and used very little make up for the role--and all supporting Asian characters were played by Asian actors, with Keye Luke a case in point.  Chan does not speak pidgen English; in both novels and films he speaks English as a second language and, quite naturally occasionally struggles with it.  Although he occasionally adopts the poise of a ""stupid Chinaman,"" he does so to mislead the suspects around him, and when a character repeatedly makes Chan the butt of racial jokes you can be pretty sure he will turn out to be the killer.

Hollywood films of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s had a very clear tendency to adopt a ""Fu Manchu"" mentality: although there was an occasionally sympathetic portrayal, most Chinese characters were either servile or evil.  Chan, however, interacts with the ""white world"" as an equal--and outsmarts them at the end.  As such, the films were remarkably advanced for their time and were in fact immensely popular with Asian-American audiences of the day.

All of this said, it is quite true that Charlie Chan films are very innocent in their outlook--but it is this innocence that gives them their charm.  Love them or hate them, they are period peices that reflect the niave failings of their day, but which do so without malice and often with considerably appeal.  In addition to a trailer for CHARLIE CHAN IN LONDON and three short but interesting ""featurettes,"" the set includes ERAN TRECE, the Hollywood-produced Spanish language version of the lost 1931 Charlie Chan Carries On, available here in a reasonable print for the first time.  Recommended for Chan fans everywhere.

I am a WWII baby. My first taste of ""Orientals"" was the anti Japanese propaganda and extreme hatred of ""The Yellow Peril.""  By the time I was  a youngster aware of what I was watching at the movies in our small town theater, Charlie Chan was dispelling ALL of the dislike of Asians.  I grew up loving and collecting Chan on tape and stayed up all night watching Chan movies on cable. I bought the Toler Chan set on LASER DISC and again on DVD.  I will buy every volume available.

I note that I have now travelled extensively in Asia and hope to return soon to see the many friends I made. Probably because of the Chan movies.  If you are Asian and think Chan was bad, remember this small town boy who admires and respects Asians!

When Fox Movie Channel sort of gave in and aired the same four films with commentary from a segment of the Asian-American community, we were short changed. Fox aired a one sided veiw from people-or groups of people-who had never watched the films and knew nothing about them. For example, had they aired the films in this collection, they would have seen how Chan dealt with other people's racism and stupid beleifs concerning Asians.

The reason these films are still popular today is because they are essentially mysteries. It isn't about-or shouldn't be about-a person's race. Chan was intelligent and intuitive. And it was demonstrated in these films.

Special footnote, actor Warner Oland was not the first actor to portray Charlie Chan on the silver screen. The Oriental detective was originally played by George Kuwa in ""The House Without a Key"" (1925) and Kamiyama Sojin in ""The Chinese Parrot"" (1927), both silent Pathe serials, and later by E.L. Park in a Fox Pictures talking feature, ""Behind That Curtain""(1929)...but for the fans of Charlie Chan it was Warner Oland who first brought to life the fictional character whose exploits have now thrilled several generations....it was in 1931 that Charlie Chan portrayed by Swedish stage actor Warner Oland with the Fox Pictures release of ""Charlie Chan Carries On""....Oland went on to make a total of 17 Chan films over a period of seven years for Fox studios.

Want to thank 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment for taking us back to those classic murder, mystery, mayhem with our ace detective...watching this legendary actor and his professional team of directors, writers as creator Earl Derr Biggers served up the best of the best during those early films of our favorite detective...wonderful character actors of the cinema brought back so many wonderful memories of the times when film makers cared about you who purchased a ticket and came back for more.

2543432,5,B000EXDSAW,"At last the early Charlie Chans, starring Warner Oland as Chan, are being released on DVD - what a treat! Sidney Toler had always been my favorite of the two actors, but I am revising my opinion. I like the loving father/son relationship between Warner Oland and Keye Luke, rather than the comic put-downs of the later Chans. Another strength is Oland's unflappable ability to float past prejudicial statements from other characters while solving the case and proving who is truly intelligent in the bargain. I think showing up prejudiced behavior for what it really is may be a better way of fighting it than sweeping it under the carpet as we do now.

  My favorites in this set are 'London' and 'Shanghai' - good mysteries and strong characters. 'Egypt' is a bit harder to take because of Steppin Fetchit whose whiny voice and stereotyped behavior grates, but has a young Rita Hayworth as an attraction. 'Paris' has long been out on key video so is an old favorite with me. There are interesting features on these DVD's as well, highlighting Earl Derr Biggers, the author of the Charlie Chan books, as well as the 'real Charlie Chan' who was a legendary policeman in Hawaii. I hope this is just the beginning of releasing these wonderful old mysteries.

2543447,5,B000EXDSAW,"In Fox's defense, I must say that the four Oland films included in this set are lucky to have survived today at all.  Four of the early Oland films no longer exist, due to accidental destruction of the negatives.  The same happened to at least 3 of these 4 films.  These existing versions have been presented from archive prints (in some cases, foreign release prints), as the negatives are gone.  Fox did the best they could to ""clean"" these up, but expected age- and wear- related blemishes remain.

PARIS was only rediscovered in the late 1980s.  EGYPT no longer has the original English titles (hence the strange looking titles on the current print, and use of stock music with some underlying sound effects present).

Based on presentations a few years ago on Fox Movie Channel, print quality should improve with the next set.  The negatives or fine grain masters exist for the remainder of the titles. Note that ERAN TRECE(1931) looks better than any of these English titles....for some reason Fox still had access to an early generation copy.

Because of this problem with the source prints, I really hated to see Fox release these 4 titles first.  I was afraid that the response would be negative, and my fears are confirmed by some of the reviews here.

Please don't give up on this series yet!  There are better films and better quality prints to come!",1152748800,18,1362,4.72457627118644
2543448,4,B000EXDSAW,"I definitely liked the movies.  Charlie Chan is enjoyable, and the supporting characters are interesting and well played.  In the current world of three-hour features, movies of one hour and fifteen minutes make for a nice change of pace, and my mother who hates long movies enjoyed them.  I was glad to have the Spanish-language movie included since it's the only one of the five based on an actual story by the books' author.  Oland obviously loves the character and takes the role very seriously indeed.

But I've got to take off a star for value.  The features are interesting and informative, but all utilize clips from these 4 films only (in addition to talking heads, locations, etc.) and all have the same commentators--this makes them seem more like commercials for the set instead of real documentaries.  I probably wouldn't have gotten that impression if they'd just made an hour-long feature by combining them.  To repeat--they are GREAT features, but breaking them up made no sense.  This should be a three disc set for less money:  one movie plus all the documentaries combined; 2 movies; last movie plus the Spanish-language movie.  Sure, four cases mean all four posters for covers--but this is a selling point for the most serious of Chan collectors only.  I'm happy that I bought this set--I'll rewatch these movies for sure--but be warned Fox:  I'll buy no future sets unless there's more material on each disc and the price comes down a bit.

Check you p.c. sensibilities at the door (I did), and enjoy some old fashioned mysteries from the '30s.

I suggest watching the extras together as one feature before watching any of the films--they provide wonderful context.  I like the fact that Chan faced some racism in each film, but more people knew of him and respected him--Chan's the hero, which is refreshing, but racism isn't glossed over either.  Stepin Fetchit in Egypt is an unfortuanate stereotype of a southern African American of the time--but it made me want to find out more about the man himself and his career.  The films are great for history buffs.  Egypt is the worst print, some missing frames and other problems--but I loved the sets, and I loved the stock footage of the Egyptian sights at that time.

The mysteries aren't too bad, the films give a very interesting glimpse into the 1930s, and Charlie Chan is definitely a hero of Asian descent--great stuff, interesting, enjoyable, entertaining.  They don't make stuff like this anymore--that's a good thing, enjoy the nostalgia.

This is the first time that I've ever seen a Charlie Chan film, and I'm eagerly awaiting future releases.",1152662400,10,2626,4.893665158371041

Perhaps we are so grateful that the studios are releasing these long-awaited classics, that we give them a pass when the pressings are not up to par.

2543453,5,B000EXDSAW,"Rather than repeat the previous reviewers' comments, let me point out that Fox has done an inspired job of issuing these films in the original order they were made. The first of this set, IN LONDON, which was actually the sixth film in the series, has the most human interest story with an innocent man condemned to hang in three days - only his sister believing in him.  Even Chan hesitates to take on this case! I can't think of a better film in the series to introduce the neophyte to Charlie Chan. Personally, I enjoy the later films where Fox ""jazzed up"" the proceedings a bit such as AT THE RACE TRACK, AT THE OLYMPICS, ON BROADWAY, and of course the very best of the series, AT THE OPERA that co-stared Boris Karloff.  But those are delights presumably to come in future volumes - and I hope Fox throws in THE BLACK CAMEL from 1931, the second film in the series and the earliest surviving Oland Chan.

Like other Chan fans, I first watched them on TV when I was a kid (before they became politically incorrect) - a quiet, insecure, tongue-tied awkward kid. And here was this wonderful character, Charlie Chan, who was also quiet, polite, and spoke slowly.  And he had his detractors too but Charlie always showed how they underestimated him badly. I could really identify with that!

Unlike Sherlock Holmes, who has proven to be a great role for many actors through the decades, Charlie Chan seems to be a one-actor role and that actor is Warner Oland (no offense to any Sidney Toler or Roland Winters fans). As Leonard Maltin has noted elsewhere, Mr. Oland seemed to be born to play Chan although the two men could not have been more different. Charlie was a teetotler, non-smoker, and family man with 11 or is it 12 children.  Oland was a heavy drinker, a smoker, and childless.  Yet Oland is said to have admired Chan and indeed eventually submerged his own personality to literally become Chan in real life.

So the Chan films can be viewed on several different levels and not merely as nostalgic and contrived murder mysteries. Ironically, I have never become a detective or murder mystery fan but I continue to make an exception for Oland's Charlie Chan films. With the current TV ""ban"" on these films, these dvds will help introduce a new public to Mr. Chan. Also, the bonus documentaries help to place into perspective the issue of a Caucasian actor playing an Asian, and I agree that if the films were made today they should star an Asian or Asian-American actor. But to censor these films from the airwaves in the 21st century is just plain wrong.  Thank heaven for dvds!

Finally, there's an extra Bonus that Fox doesn't even seem to know about! At the end of CHARLIE CHAN IN LONDON after the cast repeat, is about two minutes of ""exit music."" In the past, TV prints invarabily cut this tuneful selection so this may be something of a dvd premiere.",1151366400,17,2867,4.571150097465887
2543454,4,B000EXDSAW,"The supplemental features are definitely a plus for this set and I enjoyed them very much.  They give a lot of background on the character and the films, and the restoration efforts.  The film restoration is good, but not great; don't expect the picture restoration on the level of that done for Citizen Kane or Casablanca:  you can still see scratches and flicker, but not so much as to bother your viewing.  I'm happy with this set and hope it will lead to another release of Chan films soon.",1151107200,6,494,4.51685393258427
2543455,5,B000EXDSAW,"I had fond childhood memories of one or two Charlie Chan movies starring Sidney Toler, particularly a 16mm print of a very scary ""Charlie Chan in Black Magic"" watched at summer camp in the early 1960's.  However, my father always told me the old Warner Oland Charlie Chan movies were the best.  And, halfway through this wonderful collection of beautifully restored films, I would have to agree.

Oland's characterization is a joy to behold.

I also, and this is a real inside baseball type of recommendation, particularly enjoyed watching the terrific set decoration, costumes, and period technology in these films.

I also found the accompanying Chan documentary features very enjoyable and quite interesting.

I would very highly recommend this collector set to your attention.",1151107200,15,780,5.25
8115367,5,B000EXDSAW,"Three of the four movies here are with Warner Oland, with the final one being the first one starring Roland Winters, and as a bonus has Eren Trece, which is the Spanish version of Charlie Chan Carries On. I don't speak Spanish, but it is sub-titled. I'm not a fan of having to read a movie rather than watch it, which is the case here. Still and all, this is an ok movie, however Chan is not seen or heard of until quite late in the movie! As for the other four, the first one is the first one that still exists with Oland(the actual first movie with him in it was Charlie Chan Carries On, of which there doesn't appear to be any existing copies of) sees the sister of a man who's been convicted of murder approaching Chan to help her prove her brother's innocent! I gave this an A. The next movie, Charlie Chan In Paris, has Charlie going to Paris to meet up with a dancer, and things don't go really well here! Another A for Warner! Then we have Charlie Chan In Egypt, in which Charlie is on the hunt for a missing archaeologist which has many twists and turns. This one would have also garnered an A, except there's a character, Snowshoes, that is quite annoying, and honestly, a real insult to the black community! I gave this a B. The last movie, starring Warner Oland, is Charlie Chan In Shanghai, which is about a friend of Charlie's that says he has important information, but before Charlie can find out what, his friend is killed and Charlie himself finds himself a target. This is again quite entertaining! All-in-all, very worth the purchase price! The only issue with this release is that they stacked the disks on one spindle which is the worst way to pack a DVD set!
