366520,5,6301800982,Love her and this newest addition to my collection continues to prove my love of her and her acting....not to mention having a very young Robert Wagner in it....well done Amazon...keep the Bette movies coming :),1396310400,3,211,4.888888888888889
366521,3,6301800982,"This is one of Bette Davis' later movies made for television. She actually has a secondary role with Robert Wagner playing the main character. It's a sort of espionage/sci-fi mix. Bette's character is a Bond villain wannabe. Not to be taken seriously, it requires a great deal of suspension of belief. Davis and Wagner were probably both in it mainly for the paycheck. A guilty pleasure for fans of these two stars.",1395446400,3,415,4.777777777777778
366522,5,6301800982,"I have been dying for the day that i could finally get my hands on this movie. I have been a bette Davis fan for many years and I have seen photos of her in costume of Madame sin but never saw the movie. Well I noticed it was released on DVD this month and immediately ordered it. Though I am not a fan of movies done in the 60's or 70's, I am thrilled with this movie. It was fun and interesting and Bette Davis truly gave her character a look all on its own. If you are a Bette Davis fan, you may want to ad this to your collection. I was thrilled I did.",1392508800,2,556,3.7606837606837606
366523,4,6301800982,"This is a very unusual roll for Bette Davis. She play's a very evil woman who wants to run the world. And she doesn't care who she has killed to do it. She kidnappes important people then brain washes them to do what she wants them to do to help her get what she wants. She kidnapp's Robert Wagner to help her steal a submarine that she wants. She get's him to help kidnap a Navy offical who is in charge of moving the sub & gets him to stear the sub to where she wants it.

It is a good movie. I was surprised that it was any good at all. I only bought it because Bette was in it but I was very glad I did. Was interesting to watch.",1311379200,6,633,3.7954545454545454
366524,3,6301800982,"This was a rather strange movie. But, with both Bette Davis and Robert Wagner in it, it held my attention. Bette Davis plays an interesting part. Like always, she puts everything into it. I'd watch anything with Bette Davis, however, I would recommend this one to anyone. It is a spy/suspense movie. I believe it was made as a pilot to a TV series but ended up being shown as a TV movie. Bette Davis is superb at becoming whatever it is she needs to be at the time. In this movie, she is rather bizarre but as always captivating.",1195171200,15,529,4.3

7815485,5,6301800982,"With Robert Wagner and Bette Davis , how could it miss! Good story, although you must take into account when the movie was made. Surprise ending takes you by surprise. If you appreciate the lead actors, you'll like the movie.",1501372800,,225,4.65
7815486,5,6301800982,"As a die-hard Bette Davis fan, her first TV movie brings back memories.",1464307200,,71,4.538461538461538
7815487,4,6301800982,Hilarious fun with Bette Davis as a female Fu Manchu. Shock ending.,1462320000,,67,4.666666666666667
7815488,2,6301800982,Yes we love Bette but I'm not such an addict that I will praise every film she made just because she's in it.  It is very much of it's time and British to boot. Noisy and limp. Clown shoes.,1436313600,,189,3.8461538461538463
7815489,5,6301800982,EXCELLENT!!!!,1436140800,,13,13.0
7815490,5,6301800982,Happy to have this TV movie on DVD. I remember when I saw it in the seventies.,1413158400,2,78,3.6470588235294117
7815491,5,6301800982,I enjoyed the movie.  It was as good as I remembered it when I saw it as a kid growing up.,1406332800,2,90,3.2857142857142856
7815492,5,6301800982,"What a treat.  Miss Davis channels Gale Sondergaard from her classic ""The Letter"".  Great fun!  Now will someone release her other great TV movies from the 70's on DVD PLEASE!!!!",1399248000,3,178,4.866666666666666
7815493,3,6301800982,"So here we have complete camp from Bette Davis playing Madame Sin and having a ball doing it too. She is terrific.  The story, however, drags big time. Madame Sin needs a Polaris Sub for one of her nefarious clients and she enlists ex-God only knows what agent (since the untimely death of his wife he doesn't care) and by enlists I mean she kidnaps him. he refuses, he changes his mind, he learns the truth...blah, blah. Robert Wagner as the agent, is awful, Denholm Elliot as Madame Sin's main hatchet guy is unconvincing, the story...who cares. the only reason to watch this is Bette Davis. So if you want to just go into a vegetative state to have some fun...try it but realize what you are getting into.",1397433600,4,708,4.488372093023256
