7481441,4,B016Z8K9ME,"I just finished watching this DVD. I like the musical selections included. I spent a lot of time singing along. I did enjoy the program, but I have to nitpick a bit

I am a great fan of Panrod, but this does not do justice to his typical performance. I do not know if the technical crew was off that night or if he was not on top of his game. With 25+ years of TV production experience, I do look and listen to video differently than most people.

The audio started out a bit off. Penrod didn't sound smooth--that did get better during the concert. I also had difficulty hearing his backup singers and the choir. The instruments generally were balanced with his voice.

Exposure was mostly close on the video. Seldom was it too dark or light. Sometimes the roving spots washed out the video, but mostly was OK. I do complain about the times when the director switched between two cameras over and over. A B A B A B, etc. Also while a wide shot is helpful to give the viewer an overview of the setting, there were waaaay too many wide shots. I wish to clearly see closeup video of Penrod, his backup singers, band members, singers in the choir. Even, on occasion individual (or small groups) of the audience--not the entire stage and half of the audience.

So, I deducted a star. No I am not giving up this DVD. I do hope we can see another Guy Penrod DVD sometime before 10+ more years have passed. I also hope it will give me less opportunity to pick nits.",1454284800,4,1457,4.287272727272727

7481447,5,B016Z8K9ME,I had the CD and really enjoyed it but decided to buy the DVD.  I had no idea what I was missing.  The camera caught the enthusiasm of the choir as they sang to accompany Guy.

7481451,3,B016Z8K9ME,I love Guy Penrod and I love the selections of music on this DVD.  However the production quality is the worst I have ever seen on a supposedly professional album.  It seems the only microphone that was recording was Guy's.  The excellent musicians and backup singers can hardly be heard.  By any chance is this bootlegged copy?,1473638400,,328,4.701754385964913

7481465,4,B016Z8K9ME,"It kind of breaks my heart to give this only four stars because the music and Guy Penrod's performance are absolutely five star.  However, I agree with another reviewer who said the video is lacking.  The lighting is really bad.  Sometimes there is too much light and everything looks washed out, while other times there is not enough light.  The camera work is below average, with not enough close ups.  The camera shots did seem to get better as the concert went along.  I still very much like the concert, but I hope Guy Penrod uses a different crew for his next video.  Part way through the concert the video breaks away to show us Guy and his family.  He introduces his family and tells the viewer how old each child is.  That was fun.  I'm not sorry I bought this, and I do think it would make a good gift for any Southern Gospel / Gaither fan.  Just know that the quality of the video work is not up to Gaither standards.
