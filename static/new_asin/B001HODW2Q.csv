Both series are in Danish with English subtitles just as this film is. Actors seem to rotate between the two series, however in Springet (The Leap) only Mikael Birkkjr is recognisable from either series.
This time his character Tobias Jacobsen is told he has cancer. Unlike his Borgen character who seems to wear his vest often, Tobias is seen in bed with no vest or anything else for that matter. The Guardian newspaper seems to have become an admirer of the lamps featured in Borgen. Well they wouldn't be too happy to see Tobias's frustation when he goes crazy and smashes up his kitchen including a lampshade or two.
Made in 2005, the film features Tobias at age 42 and then in some well-timed flashbacks, we see him at 13. There's some pretty decent jazz music too. The storyline shows how Tobias deals with the fact that he has cancer and he then sets on a course of trying to prove wrong the doctor who diagnosed it.
Extras on the DVD include a Director's note in Danish which translates to English as - ""Tobias Jacobsen is 42. When the doctors tell him he is fatally ill, the earth opens beneath him and he finds himself plunging into the abyss. It makes him think of the time he was 13 and his girlfriend got him to jump off the balcony of her father's house with a sun umbrella for a parachute. Two stories separated by 29 years are told in parallel, but gradually intertwine into one drama. Both stories have moments of joy and tragedy, as fates wondrously separate and are brought back together again. It is a story about daring to take a leap of faith, about trusting yourself -- and that, ultimately, life is no good without humour, even of the darker kind.""
There's also an extensive set of Behind the Scenes Stills from the making of the film. These can be found under Diasshow on the Ekstramateriale section of the DVD.
Enjoy.

And if you'd like to see more of Mikael, Aftermath is a film made in 2004 just before Springet in which he plays the husband of a character played by The Killing's Sofie Grbl in which they deal with the death of their young daughter.",1332720000,,2702,5.25462962962963
