3871567,5,B00282GZPW,"I watched this story on 16MM film many times in the 1980s.  The gunsmith made many items to barter for the supplies he did not make himself. The DVD version was edited, and this facet of the gunsmith's work was sadly omitted. The DVD is still a nice source of information for individuals as well as a teaching aid for elementary, middle and high school teachers.",1283212800,,362,4.484848484848484
3871568,5,B00282GZPW,"Excellent DVD describing and showing actual gunsmithing tecniques used during the 1800s. If you ever wondered how gun barrels were made, this shows not only the tecniques but allso the tools of the trade in fair detail.
Nothing is left out as they take it from barrel to stock and even shows how the locks were made.
There are other items of history on the DVD I found interesting as a bonus.
Well done documentary if you are a longrifle muzzleloader fan or a blacksmithing fan, this is highly recommended for your library.",1278806400,9,523,4.634408602150538
3871569,5,B00282GZPW,"I think I have watch this documentary on VHS at least 25 times over a 30 year period. Wallace Gusler/Colonial Williamsburg do a superb job of breaking the riflesmith trade down for interested viewers. This is the best video presentation of how all of the parts for a flintlock are made and how the rifle is brought together and finished out to a unique American firearm. I highly recommend this to an individual studying the american longrifle or those interested in seeing a talented craftsman in action. You will enjoy this. If you don't like the information, maybe you will enjoy David Brinkley's voice as he speaks/describes the building steps as Gusler works.",1260144000,12,664,4.884955752212389
3871570,5,B00282GZPW,"This craftsman is amazing.  I love documentaries of this type, and this one is fascinating in its attention to detail and authenticity.  This is what is was like in Colonial Williamsburg.",1464393600,,187,5.0
3871571,5,B00282GZPW,"I first saw this 30+ years ago as a volunteer with the U S Park Service. This along with #5 of the FoxFire book series which featured Wallace Gusler and Hershel House building flintlock rifles inspired me to build longrifles myself. Gusler's long career with Colonial Williamsburg is a subject worthy of a documentary itself.  Now in his 70's, Gusler has produced rifles in the $100,000 price range. Everyone interested in early American history should see this film which features David Brinkley (American newscaster for NBC and ABC in a career lasting from 1943 to 1997) as the narrator and actor William Devane as the voice of Wallace Gusler...",1460160000,3,647,4.935779816513762

3871578,5,B00282GZPW,"I picked this DVD up during my most recent trip to Colonial Williamsburg and couldn't wait to watch it when I got home.

That being said, this DVD is simply the most fascinating documentary about craftsmen that I have ever seen.

A documentary from 1969, this DVD features renowned gunsmith Wallace Gusler, who was the master gunsmith at Colonial Williamsburg. Showing the entire process from forming an iron bar into a barrel, shaping, boring, and cutting rifling into it to hand shaping every part of the lock, to casting brass parts such as the buttplate and trigger guard, to forming the stock.

Simply put, the level of craftsmanship exhibited in this DVD is astounding. Wallace Gusler is a true artist and it shows in this DVD, as he demonstrates mastered skills of a blacksmith, foundryman, machinist, woodworker, and engraver. If you have any interest in old-school worksmanship or firearms, this DVD is for you.",1441756800,,920,4.961038961038961
3871579,5,B00282GZPW,This is an excellent example of craftsmanship that is rapidly being lost in the world. It absolutely amazes me the amount of talent this man had at an early age. I highly recommend this video for anyone interested in a time gone by or are looking for a source of informational material for trade schools.,1441756800,,304,4.545454545454546

3871584,5,B00282GZPW,"I'm not much into flintlock type firearms but the is video was captivating! It takes you through the entire process from beginning to end of making a vintage rifle. He cuts and shapes the wood for the stock. Hammers out the barrel using a forge, anvil and hammer. Melts the brass for the decorative features and pours the molten metal into sand molds.
A must see for sure!",1436400000,,372,4.485294117647059

3871586,5,B00282GZPW,"I first purchased this in VHS format when I visited Colonial Williamsburg several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed watching it many times since.
I now have DVD players and flat screen television sets in three rooms so I am in the process of upgrading my VHS films to DVD format.
This story was among my first of those upgrades.
I was additionally pleased with the added short features which were not on the VHS tape.
The quality of the DVD version was very good and I am looking forward to many more viewings from now on.",1427241600,2,521,4.4375
3871587,5,B00282GZPW,"This film was made about 1969, I remember seeing it back when I was in grade school about this same time. I loved it then and love it now. I still marvel at the skill and artistry that went to old works like this.",1425772800,,213,3.8636363636363638

3871589,5,B00282GZPW,"I had seen this presentation twice before, once when it was originally broadcast and once while attending gunsmithing school.  The history reinactors of Colonial Williamsburg take the viewer step-by-step through the process of building a replica of a fine American muzzle loading rifle of the 18th century.  Although the rifle was a necessary tool for living on the American frontier, it required the intricate blending of the skills of a blacksmith, a machinist, a woodworker and an artist.  From the ""lock, stock and barrel"" to the finely engraved patchbox and relief carving, the creation of this complex and beautiful machine inspires respect for the skill and ingenuity of our American forefathers.  For an hour the viewer time travels to an early American gunsmith's shop to learn about life in American history.",1416614400,2,818,5.221374045801527

3871591,5,B00282GZPW,"Watched this in a history class in college and have been fascinated by it ever since.  Finally decided I needed my own copy.  A great DVD of the variety of steps and skills that go into making a rifle.

One humorous note: seems that the young man in the show is the 'Master' and the older man is his 'journeyman'.",1409875200,,313,4.183333333333334

3871593,4,B00282GZPW,Was an entertaining DVD and showed a lot of what it was like to make a gun in the 1600s and 1700s.. I would have liked a bit more detail but then most folks are not as detail minded as this old machinehead.,1409356800,,206,3.813953488372093

3871597,5,B00282GZPW,"This is a video that was made in 1969, it was transferred to disc much later, so it shows it's age, but, don't let that stop you from buying it because it is a great little video! At 58 minutes, it's tv documentary length and it is paired up with a 1952 feature titled "" The Colonial Printer""(25 minutes). Both films are part of the extensive Archive Series the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation has created. If you're a history and/or firearms buff, this disc is a must have.",1392595200,2,475,4.471264367816092
3871598,5,B00282GZPW,Probably one of the best DVDs I have ever seen. I only have it 7 days and have already watched it 4 times. Unbelievable craftsmanship. I only wish there was more. The quality of the recording was poor in areas but this is only to be expected from a recoring which was made in 1960s. It was more than compensated for by the content.,1390348800,,331,4.1875
3871599,5,B00282GZPW,"I bought this a week ago and have already viewed it 4 times. The gunsmith, Walace Gusler, had
a personal story almost as interesting as the DVD - Google him - he retired as Master gunsmith in 2004
The American long rifle was a work of art and the most sought after antique firearm
I can almost guarantee that you'll love this documentary - narrated by David Brinkley.
This shows exactly how they made these rifles back then - everything , including the screws and springs, made
from scratch. Amazing.",1387238400,2,500,4.566666666666666
3871600,5,B00282GZPW,"A genuine portrayal of a period gunsmith with no hollywood hype and an informative narrative.
The fact that its a 1969 production shot on film not video just adds to its authenticity.
Absolutely gives credibility to the Gunsmith being an Artist and his skills being many.

3871601,5,B00282GZPW,"""the best"" of all of the Williamsburg Videos. I have probably watched it over one hundred times over the years I have had it. I love this video.",1362614400,5,144,4.178571428571429
3871602,4,B00282GZPW,"Love this video.  It shows the process of hand-building a flintlock rifle from start to finish in fairly complete detail.  The video was done back in 1969 so the video quality isn't what we have today but the content is what can be categorized as a lost (or nearly so) art.  It is worth more than the asking price and anyone even remotely interested in this kind of information should have it in their library.  I was in Colonial Williamsburg a number of years ago and spent some time in this very gun shop.  The equipment is still there and in usable condition.  While there I bought the VHS version and have enjoyed it for nearly 10 years now.  I recently added this CD to my library, as well.  This is how they made rifles back in the 1700's and 1800's.  Makes me wish I had a forge, tools and equipment to do this myself.",1358726400,3,825,4.2709677419354835
3871603,4,B00282GZPW,"I've previously had this in VHS form of some years back. The transfer to DVD is quite good. It's 58 minutes of excellent detail on the building of a Kentucky rifle. The craftsman in the film became an important part of Colonial Williamsburg, and has since retired. His hand-crafted firearms are in great demand. As an extra feature, there is a 25 minute docudrama on the Colonial Printer. Very nice addition.

Overall, very well done. I recommend it. Four-and-a-half stars out of 5.

Cheers,

3871604,5,B00282GZPW,Even with the 1960's production values this DVD is a great watch!  A master of his craft operating at the top of his game.  Not a how-to but a historical education in our early American craft industry.,1335484800,,201,4.405405405405405
3871605,5,B00282GZPW,"This is an amazing dvd showing old technology in creating a whole rifle from scratch. I don't know if people could this today. You will be amazed by each process, simple but refined and of course narrated by the great David Brinkley. Anyone that loves guns should own this dvd.",1324598400,,277,4.56

3871607,5,B00282GZPW,"For all who savor the rare opportunity to watch and learn from one of the few remaining true craftman/artists, this timeless video will leave you with a life-alerting image of what it takes to earn the title of ""Master Craftman"". This in-depth, historically-significant, educational presentation should be mandatory viewing for all those who would seek to create with their head and hands. Wallace Gusler, ""The Gunsmith of Williamsburg"", has set the bar for all those who wish to emulate the highest skill levels and artisanship across so many disciplines... not to mention his concise introduction to and visual demonstration of technical terminologies associated with metal crafting, metallurgy, wood crafting, and the history of their impact on the history and development of our Nation. Absolutely spellbinding for folks like me!
Five Stars... at least!",1310947200,3,857,5.451127819548872
3871608,5,B00282GZPW,This video shows you the way that flint lock rifles were made during the 1700's and 1800's.  All parts of the rifle are hand made.  It blew me away.  A true work of art.  I highly recommend this video.,1304985600,,201,4.076923076923077
3871609,5,B00282GZPW,"I have no particular interest in firearms, but I enjoyed the video very much for the outstanding craftmanship and knowledge it demonstrates. The Colonial gunsmith had to combine a wide range of skills working with metals and wood.  The video shows Wallace Gusler working his way through steps including forge-welding the barrel, shaping and inletting the stock, casting, forging and engraving metal parts, and much more. It's amazing that someone looking so young can master all the skills involved.

If you expect a how-to video, you might be a bit disappointed for it covers all the steps, but not always in great detail.

I will watch this video many times over, it was money well spent.

The DVD also includes a short 1950's film about the colonial printer. It has modest historic value overall, but it's charming in a vintage, moralizing and kitschy sort of way.",1291161600,10,867,4.917808219178082

8355513,4,B00282GZPW,As a hunter/shooter of flintlock rifles I really enjoyed the video. If you are looking for an instructional video on how to build a flintlock then this is not your video. If you want a peek at how the flintlock was made during colonial times and the importance of the printing press then you will love this video.

In retrospect I can say that I was looking for techniques relative to low relief carving and as such was disappointed in the contents of the CD. In parallel with the CD I also took a hands on carving class and can say very frankly that I found this instruction also disappointing.  Anyone who wants to pursue low relief carving should first, get a good set of basic carving tools; second, get your hands on several samples of various woods to practice on; third, make sure you have a stable work surface and adequate lighting; fourth, start chipping / in letting and experimenting to your hearts content and do not tackle the project/s you have in mind until you are sure of your skills. Keep in mind that this is a skill that, while your brain may have the desire, your hands may not ever possess the skill. A man has to know his limitations.
