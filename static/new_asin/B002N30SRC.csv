8374554,5,B002N30SRC,"I love the playful episode titles from ""Good Eats,"" and this DVD has its share of salad related puns. I like most salads and found the episodes on Caesar salad and slaw to be classic Alton Brown, and the accompanying small cookbook to be useful in attempting to recreate these recipes: try particularly ""Hail Caesar Salad,"" ""Veni Vidi Vinaigrette,"" ""Asian Slaw,"" and ""Beet Slaw,"" which the beet-phobic may find fear inducing, but which is actually great. I have to admit not caring for potato salad, so the recipes from ""This Spud's For You"" have gone unprepared in my house, though the episode itself is as informative and entertaining as always.

""Good Eats"" is still the premier educational food show, and this is a great DVD for Alton Brown fans who are also into salads of all shapes, sizes, and compositions.",1429228800,2,814,4.814285714285714
8374555,3,B002N30SRC,"So, three stars is not for the quality of the content - the quality is excellent, it is Alton Brown after all - you can be entertained with no intention of ever cooking a thing.  And, salads is an often overlooked subject.

Three stars is for the quantity and value.  You get 3 shows of <30 minutes each at a price that works out to just under 7 bucks a pop (at the time of writing the product was 20USD).  Before you buy this, see if you can get ""volumes"" or ""Seasons"".  They contain a minimum of 9 episodes.  Once you have exhausted those options (like I finally did), then look here and test your Alton addiction.  AT half the price I would call it a deal - and who knows, maybe by then it will be.",1351209600,4,701,4.072992700729927
