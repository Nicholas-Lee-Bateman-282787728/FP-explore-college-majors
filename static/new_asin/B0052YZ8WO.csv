This one is digitally perfect and I really enjoyed it.  Thanks to Warner's and their Archive Collection, these are all collected for us to sit back and enjoy.",1316995200,10,313,4.672727272727273
4533077,5,B0052YZ8WO,"I'm not ashamed to admit that this series is one of my favorites. While the production values for this series is pure Warner Brothers ca. 1940 (aka backlot grandeur), it is high on the melodrama but also charming in a folksy sort of way. The films follow a pat formula ----- the trials and tribulations of a widowed father, his sister, and his four daughters and their assorted boy friends/husbands. The only exception to this formula is Daughters Courageous which messes with the core characters. I'll get to this issue later on.
The casting is really quite good given that almost all of the cast were stock WB contract players. Claude Rains (one of my favorite actors of any film era) is cast as the father. Crotchety but sweet May Robson plays the aunt. The Lane sisters (Lola, Rosemary, and Priscilla) play three of the daughters and Gale Page plays the fourth. The men in their lives are played by John Garfield, Jefrey Lynn, Eddie Albert, Dick Foran, and Frank McHugh. Tossed into the mix is peculiar old bag neighbor Mrs. Ridgefield (Vera Lewis) who's role isn't more than a cameo in any of the pictures, but serves as a point of reference to indicate that while everything is changing some things never do.
The original entry in this series FOUR DAUGHTERS introduced John Garfield to the screen after his initial success on the stage. While it was actually his second film (his first being BLACKWELLS ISLAND), this was the film going public's first glimpse of Garfield. Unfortunately, WB didn't realize that he'd cause such a sensation and leave the audience clamoring for more because they killed his character off in this film. However, knowing they had a good thing in Garfield he made a subsequent appearance in the series as the ghost of his character Mickey Borden. DAUGHTERS COURAGEOUS was cooked up to bring back Garfield as a living character with basically the same casting with some minor changes such as Rains. The plot involved a long missing father (Rains) attempting to get back into the good graces of his wife and daughters.
What I find sort of enchanting about this series is that they reflect a time of innocence that was soon to be replaced by WWII and a grittier type of film from the major studios in Hollywood. Claude Rains was really cast against type in these films but he deftly pulled off this role as a much milder and sympathetic sort of man. Garfield gave a glimmer of his angry young man persona which he would refine and redefine in later films. The charming and often underrated Jeffrey Lynn is cool and madly handsome. I still can't completely figure out why he didn't go over bigger with the film audience of the time. Of the three Lane sisters, Priscilla was the only one whose career thrived in the '40's yet she left films by 1950. Crazy scene stealer May Robson would die in 1942. Other than Rains and Garfield, Eddie Albert was the only other actor in this ensemble that had a thriving career 10 years later.
My advice is that if you are a fan of this series or have only seen FOUR DAUGHTERS, you'll probably enjoy this set. While it is really pure soap opera it is interesting and illustrates how movie studios parlayed their more successful movies into veritable franchises. It took a world war and lack of story to bring this series down.",1313366400,38,3289,4.662650602409639

4533110,5,B0052YZ8WO,"Such a great series of movies with great actors like the Lane sisters,
Claude Rains and of course John Garfield. Raines did a good job in this film. Although it was rather weird to see him in such a role outside of his norm, I found it rather interesting in seeing him in a different character. John Garfield was brilliant in the way he portrayed the characters. Such a great interpetation of emotion and feeling.",1383436800,,413,4.52
4533111,3,B0052YZ8WO,"I liked all four of these movies -- and for one very special reason. Priscilla Lane is a delight throughout, and I cannot take my eyes off her whenever she is on the screen. Her prettiness and cute facial mannerisms make this set worth the money. She is funny, sweet, and at times quite athletic (running, sliding down the banister, doing her own modest stunts, etc.). Unfortunately, I find little else in these films to capture my attention. The other three sisters are interchangeable and forgettable, and I find the wonderful Claude Rains to be miscast here in the role of their father. Still, buy this set for the lovely Priscilla!",1372550400,,635,4.72972972972973
4533112,5,B0052YZ8WO,"A fabulous collection about the four musical daughters (the talented Lane sisters and Gale Page) and their father (Claude Rains), a musical professor, who live with his sister/housekeeper, May Robson, and the lives and loves of these vivacious young women.  Three of these four films show the progression of their intertwining lives; the fourth DVD features the same actors in a different story line, equally as enchanting.  This is a wonderful collection of love and family and talent.",1365465600,3,486,5.217948717948718

4533114,5,B0052YZ8WO,"Four Daughters is the first in a series of four films starring the same actors, but this is easily the best (ain't that usually da way!) This was based on a novel by Fannie Hurst and was later remade as a musical with Doris Day and Frank Sinatra, and renamed Young at Heart. The four Lemp sisters, Ann, Kay, Thea, and Emma, are part of a musical family, headed by their pop, Adam, and their crusty Aunt Etta. Pop brings home a tenant, a handsome young composer, Felix, and all four sisters fall in love with him, jeopardizing the romantic relationships with their current beaus. Trouble ensues when a friend of Felix, a feisty and exceedingly angry young man, Mickey, manages to fall in love with the same sister as Felix. Three of the sisters were portrayed the Lane sisters, Priscilla, Rosemary, and Lola, along with Gale Page, adding a sense of realism (as well as a terrific publicity gimmick). The supporting cast in this one helps elevate this film into the terrific category, especially May Robson and Claude Rains as Etta and Adam Lemp. Jeffrey Lynn is okay as Felix, although he hardly displays the sort of charisma that would seem to incite a rivalry between sisters. The standout of the cast, however, is the incomparable John Garfield in his film debut as Mickey. He is utterly compelling and riveting, stealing the film, even from the wonderful Claude Rains. One of the things that appeals about this film is the shimmering cinematography and unique camera angles. The film was so popular that it spawned two more films about the same characters, Four Wives and Four Mothers, which were also directed by Michael Curtiz. Four Wives was almost as good as the original and continued the story from its conclusion in Four Daughters, but Four Mothers is a sad ending to a solid series. (Prior to filming the rest of the series, Curtiz directed the same cast in Daughters Courageous, although the story involved different people; in some ways that is a superior film to this one. That one is grittier and more realistic, featuring terrific chemistry between Rains and Garfield.)",1347148800,,2085,4.778393351800554
4533115,4,B0052YZ8WO,"The four ""Four Daughters"" movies produced by Warner Brothers from 1938-1941 are an interesting mix of mild comedy and soap opera drama.

Claude Rains plays the crusty, but lovable father of four grown, beautiful daughters who are all still living at home. Rains' older sister ""Aunt Emma"" is played by the wonderful May Robson, who died shortly after the last of these four movies was made. Rains makes his living providing music lessons in his home and being the head of a local music foundation.  Aside from his family, he lives for classical music, and frowns upon loud ""swing"" music that's all the rage.

The kind, wholesome daughters are played by three real-life sisters: Priscilla, Rosemary, and Lola Lane; and the fourth is Gale Page, the tall sister with the husky voice.

These films are nostalgic, romanticized movie slices of small town American life in the years just before Pearl Harbor, courtesy of the Warner Brothers backlot. Few towns may have been like the home town where the ""Four Daughters"" lived and loved, but it's nice to think that at least some were.

Here's the order in which this series was made and released to theaters: 1. Four Daughters (1938); 2. Daughters Courageous (1939); 3. Four Wives (1939); and 4. Four Mothers (1941).

Daughter Courageous is the odd film in the series. It was rushed into release to capitalize on the rising stardom of John Garfield. He was the ""troubled"" young man who was killed in Four Daughters, the first film of the series.

In order to bring him back to life, so to speak, Warner Brothers devised a plan to use the same Four Daughters cast, but changed all the names, professions, etc., and also messed around with other formula elements that were established in the first film.

By making all these changes, Daughters Courageous became a stand-alone film that does not fit into the chronological order of the other three films in the series.

Here's the order that I would recommend watching these films, so that one film logically leads into the next one: 1. Four Daughters (1938); 2. Four Wives (1939); 3. Four Mothers (1941); and then 4. Daughters Courageous (1939).

Reviews of each film can be found by other reviewers or under the individual titles of each film. Also, it is more economical to buy all four films together in this collection.  The Four Daughters Collection costs about half the price of buying each title on an individual basis. Chances are, if you like this sort of movie (or know someone who does), you will want to see them all.",1342569600,13,2519,4.78110599078341
4533116,3,B0052YZ8WO,"These movies are good; I'd seen them before, and they have very good casts and production values.  I was disappointed, however, that I couldn't play them in my main DVD player!  I decided not to return them, since I was able to play them on a small TV/DVD combo player that I have.  I don't understand why the incompatibility; my main player isn't an ""off"" brand.",1325462400,2,363,4.46969696969697
4533117,5,B0052YZ8WO,"I've never encountered this problem before.  When I inserted the first DVD into my computer (for reason related to variuod disabilities I watch all DVDs on my computer) it took many attempts rto get it to play properly.  The second DVD played  only intermittently and the third and fourth DVDs did not play at all.  Only after a good amount of struggles did I notice that the DVD box explained that the discs were designed to play in DVD players and might not play on computers.  Of course, I could not find such a warning on Amazon's website.  It might be there, but it's well hidden.

Despite these problems and the hassle I will now have to go through to get prperly playing copies of the movies, this series is a wonder.  Claude Rains steals the show and May Robson, as his sister, is almost his equal.  John Garfield  played his ""loser"" part to perfection.  The series has melodrama and soap opera written all over it, but who cares.  This is fun.  Forget that no family such as this ever existed.  It's fun to pretend.",1320105600,9,1024,4.464864864864865
