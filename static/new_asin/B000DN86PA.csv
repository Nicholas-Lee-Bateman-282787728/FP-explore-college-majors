8304677,2,B000DN86PA,"Second of the three movies based on the ""Fibber McGee & Molly"" radio comedy.  This one isn't quite as funny as the first film, but has some amusing bits for those who know the characters from radio.  There are some rather surreal bits with Charlie McCarthy prancing around on his own without Edgar Bergen, and a politically-incorrect visit to an Indian reservation.

Mildly amusing and probably a great hit in its day when everyone in America would have known all the characters intimately.",1238716800,,490,4.879518072289157
