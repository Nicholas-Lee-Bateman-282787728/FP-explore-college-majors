4650203,5,B005BYBZKY,"Absolutely fantastic news for us L&H fans! my first exposure to Stan & Ollie in the now dim and distant pre-home video Stone Age Era was via my uncle's Super 8  Blackhawk film collection when I was a kid--I was immediately enchanted with their comic timing and genius...and burdened with the fairly certain knowledge that by the end of any given film, dire calamity would befall Ollie's only pair of trousers!
If anyone out there has access to the complete listing of films and extras included in this set I would appreciate the posting...",1311206400,7,539,4.73404255319149
4650204,5,B005BYBZKY,"Finally!!!  I have been waiting years for a full release of Laurel and Hardy.  All I have are badly worn VHS, taped off of TV from the old WWOR days when they were played on Sunday morning.  This is great news!",1311120000,22,210,4.073170731707317
4650205,5,B005BYBZKY,and it comes out three days before my birthday! I'e been waiting for this since DVD's started hitting the market. I grew up watching these with my family and still enjoy them today. Can't wait!,1311120000,9,193,4.542857142857143
4650206,5,B005BYBZKY,"For two decades, most of the famous films of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy have been off the video market, thanks to apathetic handling by the company then holding the rights. Now, finally, the rights have reverted to knowledgeable hands, and that means the boys are back.

This 10-disc set includes most of Laurel & Hardy's talkie shorts and features produced by Hal Roach between 1929 and 1940. These are among the funniest comedies ever made, as many vintage-film buffs will agree. Laurel & Hardy were often capable of carrying the action almost entirely by themselves: BRATS has Stan and Ollie as themselves and their own sons (with giant sets and trick photography); THE MUSIC BOX is the Oscar-winning featurette with the boys as the world's worst piano movers; HELPMATES has Stan helping Ollie to clean house after a wild party; THEIR FIRST MISTAKE has our heroes adopting a baby; TOWED IN A HOLE has them rehabbing a boat; BUSY BODIES turns them loose in a carpentry shop. You'll see dozens of examples of how inventive they were with pantomime and dialogue. Their short subjects were so successful that they branched out into full-length features, including their famous hits WAY OUT WEST and SONS OF THE DESERT, the prison comedy PARDON US, the ""gypsy"" comedy THE BOHEMIAN GIRL, the hour-of-sight-gags BLOCK-HEADS and SAPS AT SEA, and several others, including both versions of A CHUMP AT OXFORD (the standard 63-minute print of 1940, and the 42-minute, differently edited ""streamliner"" released in 1943). The supporting casts read like a who's-who of familiar faces: Edgar Kennedy, Billy Gilbert, Charlie Hall, James Finlayson, Mae Busch, Anita Garvin, Walter Long, Harry Bernard, Eddie Dunn, Daphne Pollard, and a host of others. You'll be laughing through 58 L & H comedies.

The wonderful news about this set is that the DVDs are presented in high definition, from the original surviving 35mm film elements. They are NOT taken from RHI's tape transfers that aired on AMC in the 1990s, or the broadcast masters prepared in 1986 for TV's ""Laurel & Hardy Show"" (some of which are still playing on TCM, and often in shortened form). The DVD producers went back to the source materials, meaning that the vintage Laurel & Hardy comedies have never looked or sounded better on video. The DVD producers have taken some pains with the restoration: picture and sound have been cleaned up digitally; most of the subjects feature the attractive, seldom-seen original titles; and even individual shots cut short in current prints have been restored to their original lengths.

In the early days of sound films, before the advent of voice dubbing, some American producers made international versions of their films, with the actors speaking each foreign language phonetically. Laurel & Hardy made several of these multilingual versions, and seven of them are included in this set. These versions offer some surprises, with many of the ""American"" gags extended, and even some entirely new scenes unique to the continental prints.

This set differs from the European 21-disc set in that the silent films and the colorized TV editions have been omitted, which cuts the disc space down to a manageable and economical 10 discs. The total running time averages out to a little over three hours per disc, perhaps not the ideal compression rate but about par for the ""double-feature"" DVDs on the market today.

The set also includes some two hours of bonus features, of special interest to Laurel & Hardy admirers. THE TREE IN A TEST TUBE is gorgeous, in excellent color, and appears to be a first-generation video copy from the U. S. Government source (except for the main title, the source print appears to be uncirculated). The team makes cameo appearances in ON THE LOOSE, ON THE WRONG TREK, and WILD POSES, and all three shorts are included in their entirety.

Print quality on the titles I've seen is superior to any previous video release. For a sample, I went straight to the traditionally battered and bruised titles to check the quality. COME CLEAN, which is usually seen in murky, contrasty prints, is here in much-improved condition, from 35mm with the original main titles. PARDON US, the boys' first feature, is the longer, pre-release preview print, with original main titles and in much better shape than usual (the song ""Lazy Moon"" has none of the patchwork repairs we're used to seeing). THEIR FIRST MISTAKE is seen at last with the full, original title sequence intact. HOG WILD has usually been seen in slightly soft focus; the video version is an improvement. Keep in mind that some of these 58 comedies won't look like they were photographed yesterday because the negatives have been consulted far more often than is customary. Theatrical reissues, TV revivals, and home-movie reprints have caused the 35mm materials to be run through printing machines again and again over the years, with wear and tear showing in the copies. It is a tribute to the DVD producers that they found and used superior archival materials for this set, and many of the ""shopworn"" subjects have been upgraded.

Collectors will appreciate many new versions of old favorites. PERFECT DAY is seen in its familiar 1936 form, and (surprise!) in its original 1929 form without the music track. BRATS is also seen with alternate music tracks (but curiously, the ""1930"" version has vintage-1937 reissue titles, even though the original titles are known to exist). PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES is the longer, original-release print; it includes some unpleasant domestic-abuse scenes that were removed for reissue, but it also includes a longer version of the ""Three Bears"" bedtime-story sequence.

Bottom line: this long-awaited release is the best boxed set of comedies offered in years. Ideal for family viewing, and these timeless classics can be enjoyed over and over again. Laurel & Hardy are true masters, and you won't be disappointed.

It would be a great gift for any occasion.",1501027200,,374,4.420289855072464
4650299,5,B005BYBZKY,"I used to watch Laurel & Hardy when I was a kid in the early 80s in my home country. This is an excellent box set that contains all of their films. Some reviewers criticize the packaging. I personallly love the packaging. I wish all of the box sets were packaged this way. These reviewers complain about the ability to take the CDs out of the sleeves; I have no problem with that. You can easily grab the edge of the DVD and slide it right out. I actually prefer these types of paper sleeves to plastic holders. I remember reading negative reviews about Pink Floyd's box set DISCOVERY for the same reason. I disagree that the plastic cases are better. When you place the DVD in a plastic case, the DVD touches the base of the plasric case, that's not a better situation that the DVD touching the high-quality paper sleeve. I have owned this set for 3 years now and DVDs are still the same quality without any scratches. But enough of the packaging. The films are great, and just as funny as I remember them. OK, there are some repetitive physical humor where people fall, or the doors get slammed in their face, and Hardy's signature sigh ""Ohhhhhh""  seem to become too formulaic but despise these minor flaws, I think the quality of all the films are excellent. One other flaw is that there are no subtitles. I guess that's because these films are almost 100 years old and back then there was no subtitles/closed captioning. Although I think they could be digitally added for this production. My next dream is for this collection to become Bluray. I can't wait for that to happen.",1500076800,,1580,4.505226480836237

4650335,5,B005BYBZKY,"I absolutely love this set, which I bought almost 4 years ago. Just the fact that loading a disc and seeing several scenes playing at once in the disc menu is quite enjoyable, and you get to hear their theme constantly during it. Another massive bit of value of this set, besides the picture greatness. is the availability of captioning! IIRC, there is no true captioning, but the foreign versions of some of the films have sub-text which is done excellently. Hard to believe sometimes when you see a foreign version, which is actually spoken in that language by the boys, just how almost mirror-like the performances are to the original English versions. Normally, I would never think to buy a non-English version of any film, but the boys show that it is possibly to get sub-text equating to getting captioning from films that have never had captioning. I am curious for those who absolutely need captioning, if they had ever thought this sort of thing through like that, that there may be an entire treasure trove of foreign sub-texted material out there? I just lost my Mom Saturday, and I only got into captioning interest because she was completely deaf. Too bad I hadn't figured this out earlier. Heck, hard to believe I had this four years and it is only now that I thought there might be an entire world of English spoken film, made for a foreign audience, then subtexted in English!",1492992000,,1392,4.685714285714286

4650340,5,B005BYBZKY,"Love these two slapstick comics.  All of my favorites are included in this set.  ""Way Out West"" is the best, especially the parts where they sing and dance.  The set is worth every penny.",1487894400,,187,4.4411764705882355
4650341,5,B005BYBZKY,"I've loved these guys since I was a little kid and recently treated myself to this collection for my 70th birthday. The restored versions of all of their essential films look and sound great and the boys are just as funny as they were sixty-plus years ago. Loved the liner notes in the disc sleeves, which inspired me to order Simon Louvish's bio, which I just finished last night.

4650430,5,B005BYBZKY,Laurel and Hardy films are always great. But what could have made this a superb DVD is if they would have added Closed Captions or Subtitles.

All of my other discs play great on the Oppo and I have well over 1,000 discs. I cant figure it out for the life of me. Does anyone have any idea what is wrong?

4650450,2,B005BYBZKY,"I cannot believe they can call this collection essential, because it is missing significant portions of every frame due to heavy cropping. I do not know if every short is cropped but for example, ""Towed in a Hole"" opens with a sign that reads ""Crabs a Specialty"" but in this release that sentence is cut off half way at the bottom. In the 21-DVD Universal Video release (Europe only), you can read the whole sign and even see the white space underneath it. When I compare both releases side-by-side, the cropping is so bad it is unforgivable. These release cannot be considered originals because of this severe cropping, and for that alone I could not recommend them.",1464393600,7,667,4.7094017094017095

4650455,5,B005BYBZKY,"I purchased this set because it contained the short ""The Live Ghost"". I have not seen this since I was growing up in the 1950's and found it to be just as funny as I remembered it. There have been many erudite commentaries about this set and the history of Hal Roach and various releases of the boys films. I don't really care about these factoids, only that films I grew up loving are finally available to own. One person wanted the set to contain colorized versions and was knocking the set for this reason. Really ? The originals were shot in B&W so why review or purchase a set that's not put out in the format you want ?

The packaging sucks. Obviously designed by some nurse-a-nickel pencil-neck dumb Kopf. I have plenty of CD Jewel cases I use for my video and audio productions so each disk will be getting a new home as it is removed from the Kludgey packaging.

While some have pointed out that not all the boy's films are represented here, I feel the set is a marvelous compendium of the majority of the boys films I remember watching years ago.

Bo Hunks - The boys join the foreign legion so Hardy can forget Geenie Weenie. After they get to their post, they tell the commandant they forgot what they came to forget and want to go home. Hilarious !

The Live Ghost - The boys get a Buck for each sailor they shanghai but the end up getting shanghaied on the same ship they shanghaied the sailors for. Then the fun begins. I bought this set just for this short.

Busy Bodies - Laurel and Hardy working as ""Millwrights "" . Sight gags and just flat out funny situations make this a comedy classic.

I have liked Laurel and Hardy since the first time I saw them in the early 1950's on our local kids program ""The Marshall J Show"". The Marshall introduced us to Laurel and Hardy, the Three Stooges and myriad Warner Brothers cartoons. Bugs, Daffy Elmer and Tweety. Owning this set is a real trip down memory lane and a reminder of how fortunate I was to grow up right after the end of WW II. It was a period of unprecedented  prosperity and a wonderful time to be a kid. It is easy to see how comics like Tim Conway and Dick Van Dyke learned their craft from watching the boys do their thing.

I haven't made a dent in viewing all the content but what I have seen so far is definitely good quality and very watchable. I will enjoy this set for a long time.",1456963200,2,2364,4.261160714285714

The shorts of Laurel & Hardy have been syndicated on TV since longer than anyone can remember.  Most fans of L&H have seen them many times but will appreciate the excellent job of mastering that has been done here.

To wit:  Every DVD has multiple selections of the L & H movies. You can pick and choose.  But what is missing is the ""play all"" feature standard on all DVD's!  It's the proverbial ""pita"" constantly having to select the next movie on a DVD,  One DVD has nine L & H movies.  Every time a selection ends you have to select another movie.  These movies should flow continuously without having to select a particular title nine times.  Quality and packaging (including notes and a beautiful album) are superb.  Someone wasn't thinking.

Only note is some of the films have a lesser picture quality than previous DVD releases, but not so much so that you would notice unless you were to closely compare.

Regarding all the concern in other reviews regarding packaging, I find the packaging to be completely satisfactory. If you have for some reason the inability to slip a disc out of a cardboard sleeve without touching the playing surface, I recommend simply using your thumb and finger to grip the edges and simply pull the disc out. I've retrieved all ten discs more than once each without ever being forced to touch the playing surface.

However, my DVD boxed set arrived as though it had actually been packed by Stan and Ollie themselves! It came in a cardboard box, not much bigger than the DVD set itself, with a single sheet of very thin bubble wrap placed on top of the DVD, and that was it.
There was nothing to stop the DVD moving around side to side and up and down in the box, needless to say, after its journey from the USA to Britain the outer DVD box was ""a bit damaged"" when I opened the parcel.
Thankfully though, the discs have so far played perfectly.

They are packed slightly tight so they do not fall out, all one has to do is to insert one's finger between the cardboard to widen the opening,  the disc comes right out.  I cannot believe some have complained about the sleeves being too tight.

Now to the review: Finally, after waiting many decades this set is available in America.  The picture quality is exceptional as is the sound.
Some of the shorts I have never seen before,  they were wonderful to watch.
The quality of the sound and video is remarkable considering how old they are.
They definitely set the stage for many comedians to follow who do slapstick and more, the most innovative duo ever.
I have watched all the dvd's in my set and love everyone of them, I am one happy camper, I love Laurel and Hardy.
You will be very happy with your set, and do not forget, the sleeves are not a problem at all.

The films in this collection are all talkies and all remastered as well as can be expected for films as old as they are.  This is a great collection and highly recommended.  Comedians today should study Laurel and Hardy's material.

Sure, this set does not contain any of their silent shorts nor anything after 1940, but to me it is Stan and Oliver at their peak.  It is the shorts I remember watching with my father.  The video and audio quality are as good as it can get for films of that time period.  I know reviews of this sort are subjective, but to me this is a wonderful collection.

4650582,4,B005BYBZKY,"...don't expect pristine quality. All the talking shorts (and most of the foreign language expanded versions with subtitles ) are included
,  but some of the Hal Roach features had to.be excluded for copyright reasons. The six earliest shorts had their pictures cropped from the left side in order to get the sound on film(a technical explanation is given by ZAP, review from January 26, 2014). There are also issues with sparkles, vertical lines and other imperfections. Those in the know say this is the best we can do sound and visual wise until the UCLA restoration project is completed, which could be a decade or more from
now. Other than the foreign versions, there are no captions. Comparisons to other remastering efforts such as the Three Stooges are unfair, since the L&H films(especially the shorts and their foreign counterparts), have been terribly abused over these many decades. The book style format with informative liner notes is rather nice. As far as complaints about the DVD sleeves, I've seen worse (e.g. The Beatles 2009 CD remasters).",1421366400,3,1059,5.017045454545454
4650583,5,B005BYBZKY,"For years..fans and buffs of L&H's best films..had to be content with inferior prints that were poorly transferred to VHS videocassettes or to dvd's..that didn't showcase the boys at their best.

  But?

  Finally Vinendi Films has been able to find top 35mm prints and make the best transfers of the boys' films
from their vintage years at The Hal Roach Studios and create a brand new collection of films..that allow everyone
to see Stan and Babe at their best.

  Along with the best visual quality..the collection also features commentary from film historians:Dick Bann and
Randy Skredvedt and film comedy performers:Chuck McCann and Mr. Tim Conway..who provide some insights
into the making of""Way Out West"",""Another Fine Mess"" and""Sons Of The Desert""..the collection also has a new
documentary about the team and a look at some of the locations..where the duo shot their films.

  The interviews in the documentary are informative and fun and so is the tour of the locations in Southern,
Cal. with commentary provided by Dick Bann and fellow members of the ""Way Out West""chapter of ""The Sons
Of The Desert""(A real life L&H film appreciation club that was founded 50 years ago by Dr. John McCabe,Al
Kilgore,Chuck McCann,John Municino and Orson Bean):Bob Satterfield and Jim Wiley,Jr and his son.

  This collection doesn't include""Hollywood Revue Of 1929"",""Hollywood Party of 1934"",""The Devil's Brother"",
""Babes In Toyland""/""March Of The Wooden Soldiers"",""Pick A Star""and""The Flying Deuces""(which can be found
in separate collections here at Amazon)..but for the L&H fans and buffs..who want to see the other shorts and
features of the team..this is the one dvd collection to have.",1421280000,3,1685,5.258426966292135

We have well over 100 DVDs, most purchased before this set and do not have this problem with any of the others. As for content I am a real fan and introduced my Grandson to the Laurel and Hardy comedy with this set. I will have to go back to older individual Laurel and Hardy DVDs in my collection. How disappointing.

Update: Just to experiment, I tried loading and playing these on an antique DVD player I have. They loaded and played fine. So I then tried a range of DVDs from new to really old in the Blu-Ray/DVD player and they all loaded and played just fine. So something happened to these disks over time that made them hard to read on the newer Blu-Ray/DVD player (at one time it read them just fine). Examining the disks there are no scratches or discoloration. Baffling. At least you now know a work-around if this happens to you.",1420243200,5,951,4.342696629213483

4650628,5,B005BYBZKY,"The quality of this set is excellent. The videos and sound are clear, the packaging is efficient and easy to use, and the extras really add to the collection.
The package looks like a board book, where each of the ""pages"" list and describe the short films and contain the corresponding CD inserted in them. There are ten such pages for ten CDs and a cover page inside the hardback book.
The extras include a Spanish version of ""Night Owls"" (21 minutes) called ""Landrones"" (36 minutes), where they took the original film, re-shot dialogue with Stan and Ollie speaking Spanish (phonetically), added more sight gags, and put it all back together into a new, Spanish movie. If you watch ""Night Owls"" first, you'll notice flaws (continuity errors and places where a scene wasn't, but should have been re-shot) in ""Landrones"", but I don't know if you'd see them as clearly if you just watch ""Landrones"". Similar things were done with ""Blotto"", ""Below Zero"", ""The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case"", ""Chickens Come Home"", and ""Be Big!"" combined with ""Laughing Gravy"" (in French and Spanish). All of which are worth watching because of the changes/improvements from the originals.
Other extras are ""A Tribute to Laurel & Hardy"", ""On Location with the Boys"", a ""Laurel & Hardy Guest Appearances"" collection, and small set ""Laurel & Hardy Trailers"" for three of their films, ""Pack Up Your Troubles"", :""A Chump at Oxford"", and ""Saps at Sea"".",1411171200,5,1421,4.949790794979079

4650647,3,B005BYBZKY,"Having most Laurel & Hardy film on VHS, I nevertheless purchased this boxset when it came on sale. Frankly, I was surprized that such key films as ""BONNIE SCOTLAND"" and ""THE DEVIL'S BROTHER"" were missing, and thus I have graded this boxset with a mere three stars. On the positive side, two L&H films I lacked in my VHS collection, ""BLOCKHEADS"" and ""UNACCUSTOMED AS WE ARE"", were included in this boxset, so all was not for naught! Also on the plus side of the ledger, the quality of the films in this boxset are very good. However, for most L&H fans the inclusion of foreign language renditions of their films in this boxset seems like a waste of space that could have been better utilized with films that were glaring omissions in this offering. On a related note, the appearance of the glamourous THELMA TODD in so many of the L&H films included in this boxset begs the question, WHEN IS A BOXSET OF THE THELMA TODD SHORT FILMS PRODUCED BY HAL ROACH GOING TO BE RELEASED?",1408060800,,974,4.508474576271187

it also included shorts they only did cameos in.  There was even a war effort short on all the products you have that are made of wood.
The cameos are great because you see a great short would never have even known existed if not for them.  Two young ladies whose dates always come up with the novel idea of going to Coney Island for the day.  Meet 2 gentlemen with novel idea of taking them to Coney Island for the day.

Many are in 2-3 versions - 1 straight and 1 or 2 with commentary.  I listened to 1 with commentary for 5 minutes and that's all I could take.  Restarted without commentary.  The commentary was at best so-so,  Distracted and interfered with the story line.  The commentary may give you something, it didn't me.

4650668,1,B005BYBZKY,"I am not giving this set a single star because of the films. I am a huge Laurel & Hardy fan, and would not have bought the set unless I already loved the films. But this set has some major problems.

First of all, lets go over the history of Laurel & Hardy on home video. They were the originals when it came to that. When Blackhawk Films began selling 16mm and 8mm films to the home market in 1952, Laurel & Hardy silents were in their first catalog. Between the 50s and 80s Blackhawk upgraded their catalog each time they were sold better preserved film prints from collectors, and this would occasionally include a better copy of a L&H film. Hal Roach himself lost or sold off most of his film library. In the 70s he began to re-acquire the rights to his studios films, including most of the L&H films, for television distribution. Having regained the rights to all the silent films, he entered a business arrangement with Richard Feiner to distribute them on a syndicated series called Laughtoons. Roach and Feiner had a falling out, and Feiner ended up walking away with the rights to the silent L&H films.

Roach had hired Michael Agee to restore his film library. Blackhawk relied on collectors selling them their libraries. Agee did detective work, located quality prints in various archives, and gradually restored the Roach library. After the fall out with Feiner, Agee restored the sound library for Roach, most of the results appearing on the syndicated Laurel & Hardy Show. At the same time the home video rights were acquired by Nostalgia Merchant. That company made their own video transfers from various archives including Nostalgia Merchant for a 9 volume VHS set of their shorts, and a handful of their feature films. Later Cabin Fever would release budget volumes of L&H films on VHS, mastered directly from the Roach collection. In the 90s Agee licenced the rights to the silents from Feiner and began releasing the silent films on Laserdisc and later DVD as ""The Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy"" for Image. These were silents that had been further restored since they had appeared on Laughtoons, and included a couple of silents that were previously considered lost.

In the early 2000s, Universal, who owned the distribution rights to all the L&H films in Europe, made a digital restoration of the entire existing L&H Roach catalog. The results were released in Germany in a box set of DVDs. At the same time Halmark acquired HRH ( Hal Roache's distribution company after his studio closed ) and along with it the rights to the L&H sound films. They began releasing them on DVD, but used the already existing Nostalgia Merchant masters instead of making new video transfers from the Roach library. North American L&H fans complained that they were not getting the European restoration, and many paid a small fortune to get the Universal discs imported.
This new set was the first North American DVD release of the Roach films mastered from film prints. But it can not be called a complete collection. There are many films Hal Roach did not have the rights to. Agee still holds the exclusive rights to release the silents on home video. Hal Roach had been contracted with Metro Goldwyn-Mayer as his distributor. When he wanted to switch to United Artists in the 40s, M.G.M. threatened to sue. To drop the suit, Roach agreed to give them the rights to some of his feature films. M.G.M. ended up owning the Laurel & Hardy features Bonnie Scotland, The Devil's Brother and Pick a Star ( a film L&H had an extended cameo in ). There were also five films L&H made for M.G.M. independent of Roach. Hollywood Review of 1929, The Rogue Song, Hollywood Party, Air Raid Wardens and Nothing But Trouble. Six more films were made for 20th Century Fox after L&H left Roach Studios. Atoll-K was made for European studios and released in this country as Utopia. And their most famous film ( because it has been shown on television so often ) the Flying Deuces, was made for R.K.O. Their second famous film ( due to repeated television broadcasts ), Babes In Toyland, is no longer owned by Roach. When he obtained the rights to do a film adaption of the play, those rights were to expire in the 1950s. A year before their expiration he sold the film to Lippert Pictures who, for legal reasons, renamed it March of the Wooden Soldiers. Lippert continued to release the film in the 50s and even sold it to television without getting sued, and from there the rights passed from company to company, eventually ending up owned by M.G.M.

Because these films are not on the DVD set, it can not be called ""complete"". But without their best silents The Second Hundred Years, Putting Pants On Phillip, Battle of the Century, Two Tars, Liberty, Double Whoopee and Big Business, and without Babes in Toyland, could it even be called their essentials? Not getting a full set of all the L&H films isn't really a big complaint. Most L&H fans already owned the silents via the ""Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy"" volumes. They already purchased The Devil's Brother and Bonnie Scotland from the TCM Laurel & Hardy collection. In fact, they had the opportunity to purchase every movie not included in this set from past release. Even those Fox films. Having those films in this set would have been redundant. Only those waiting for an ultimate set with every film, or at least every film made at Roach studios, would find this set disappointing for what is not included.

WHAT I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS SET

But I do have some real complaints. Lets begin with the cropping. When transferring these films to DVD, most of them were cropped. One of the worst is the first film, Unaccustomed As We Are. Characters walk out of frame, and other times are only half in frame. Too many times we see only half or less of the faces of Thelma Todd, Mae Busch and Edgar Kennedy. This is inexcusable. When Michael Agee included the same short on his ""Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy"" collection, the entire film was uncropped. So why was RHI unable to do the same? There have been some rumors that some or all of the films were cropped for HD television aspect ratio during the scanning process, and then re-cropped back to the original aspect ratio when RHI Entertainment discovered the mistake. While these are still rumors, it would explain the bad cropping on the films in this set.

The set includes seven foreign versions of their movies, including both the French and Spanish versions of Be Big! & Laughing Gravy. Some have complained about the inclusion of these movies in the set. But these were not just foreign language versions of these films. If that were the case then they could have just had the foreign language on a separate track. When the sound era began, studios were confused as to what to do about their foreign language markets. With the silents, all they needed to do was translate the title cards. Sound meant the actors would be speaking in English, and the films could not be distributed in countries where the population did not speak English. Dubbing the soundtrack in another language defeated the reason for sound film, which was hearing the original voice of the actors. Even if the original actors dubbed their own voices, since they were speaking a different language, the lip-sync would be off, just as dubbed Godzilla look strange in this country. The simple solution was to have the cast redo each scene in different languages. So technically, the foreign versions count as completely different L&H films. But aside from Laurel & Hardy speaking in a foreign tongue and having different co-stars, these films usually had another major difference. Since they were not subject to the Hays Code, the foreign films usually had gags and even scenes that were censored from the American version. My complaint was that the set should have had all the existing foreign language films. It does not make sense to have a lot but not all of these films. True, some are still missing, or may have never existed in the first place. But there are many I know aired on AMC that were not on this set. For those of us looking to complete out L&H library, the decision not to include all of the foreign films was a disappointment.

Which leads to another major disappointment. Pardon Us was the first official feature film made by L&H. The American version clocked in at 56 minutes. In 1986 3M tried to put the film on laserdisc, and discovered the print they had ran 64 minutes. It turned out to be a preview print still containing scenes Laurel had edited out of the American print. For the next decade the 64 minute version was considered the definitive version. But then the Spanish Language version was discovered, and it had the long lost fire scene that had been cut from the American print. Apparently it somehow violated the Hays Code, and a completely different ending was shot. The American version has L&H foiling a prison riot with a tommy gun. The Spanish, and possibly other foreign versions had a fire break out at the wardens house during the riot, and L&H rescuing the Warden's daughter. In both versions, L&H are given a pardon for their actions. A 70 minute version of the film using dubbed scenes from the Spanish version to replace gags missing from the American version. The prison riot now ends with the fire at the Warden's house, dubbed into English. This is the version used in the set. However, this version edits out some of the footage from the 64 minute version. Sure, some of that footage was redundant, such as the second time L&H end up in solitary confinement, but it still means that footage is missing. Another problem with the 70 minute version, it has the American ending where Laurel raspberries the Warden. The Spanish version ends differently. Laurel does not raspberry the Warden, and they both end up outside the prison gate for one last callback gag involving their prison photos. The set should have included the Spanish, 64 minute preview print, and the 70 minute restoration print. Limiting the set to only the 70 minute version means that footage of L&H that includes gags were needlessly not included. Not even as ""deleted scenes"" extras.

Of course I have some of the same complaints that others have. The casing the DVDs came in seems designed to scratch the discs. A lot of my discs came scratched. They still worked, but that could change the next time I remove the discs from the box. It is almost as if Stanley and Ollie were the design team for this set. And despite claims of these films being restored and the best prints available, only a few have been restored, and most are not the best prints available. The prints are worlds better than what Halmark had released on DVD, but nowhere as good as the Universal restorations. For all of these reasons I can not give this set more than a single star, even though I love the films of Laurel & Hardy. RHI Entertainment made too many mistakes on this set.",1406073600,35,10943,4.677570093457944

The Laurel and Hardy brand of humor is so sweet and innocent, sometimes silly, relying mostly on situational gags and genius comedic timing. My favorites are all in this set with the exception of the wonderful holiday film March of the Wooden Soldiers (Babes in Toyland), which also has been remastered and is available as a separate DVD.

Yes, Abbott and Costello are very good, great in terms of vaudeville--they sure lifted a lot of bits from those days, but they are earthbound. Laurel and Hardy's warmth and humanity belong to the universe. One of my favorite moments is at the end of Chumps of Oxford, I won't spoil it, but the affection between the two men deals with a reference to a double chin. It will emotionally blow you away!!!!

4650689,5,B005BYBZKY,"When I was a kid I use two watch these two goofs with my Dad on Channel 4 WCCO Sunday morning TV back in the early 70's. Course at the time I thought it was sorta stupid, but as I got older I really grew to appreciate L&H humor. Jump ahead to three years ago and I started catching them on the local cable company.  Antenna TV (Channel 247) would play the guys on Sunday mornings for an hour and half....THEN they took them off the air.  Thud.  I was just really getting back into them guys and they stripped it from me.  So I set out to find ""any"" Laurel and Hardy I could.  Wal Mart was a bust, Target, Best Buy...nothing. So I started to go to Pawn America's and I would sift through endless stacks of the worthless used DVD's and only found but a handful. Flying Deuces, Great Guns and Be Big ...my wife bought me for X-mas the box set Alone and Together, which is GREAT...some historic stuff on there, but 90% was silent film.  I wanted to relive my time with my Dad, watching it on Sunday morning TV. Then I found this ""The Essential Collection"".

4650704,5,B005BYBZKY,"For fans of L&H, I highly recommend this set.  It has nearly everything (talkie-wise) except one or two titles that get the $ on their own (i.e. March Of The Wooden Soldiers).  The re-do's for the spanish versions might be a little tedious for some, but watching those and their english counterparts back-to-back is worth it just to see the detailed physical work they were able to duplicate and the hysterical differences that pop up.
I admit I'm not a big fan of commentary, but the little I have listened to is full of stunning bits of information and lovely stories.
Highly recommend.",1392076800,,588,4.699029126213592
4650705,5,B005BYBZKY,"I grew up laughing at Laurel and Hardy, they are always welcome in my home.
I had several of their movies on VHS tape, and decided that it was time to get up to speed with an upgrade of my modest collection, and ""Laurel & Hardy: The Essential Collection"" was a good start in that direction. No matter how many times I have seen their films, they never fail to crack me up, therefore I would heartily recommend the Essential Collection to anyone interested in Stan and Ollie.",1391472000,,474,4.3977272727272725

4650708,5,B005BYBZKY,"There are a number of DVDs available with varying levels of quality in video and audio. These are for the most part excellent in quality and a great compilation of their movies over the years.

The included written materials are helpful, especially for newbies to L&H, to learn about background information, etc on each of the movies and of ""the boys"".

I had been trolling this set since it came out but really didn't want to pay the going price. Kept an eye on Amazon and fleaBay and had set a price point that I would push the button at. Right after Christmas the Amazon price suddenly dropped ten bucks below my price point...yay!",1390867200,,634,4.552631578947368

4650710,4,B005BYBZKY,"This is definitely the best L&H collection available so far, but some of their work is missing.  It only covers their work from 1929 to 1943.  However, there are none of their silent films from the 1920's and none of their files from the late 1940's and early 1950's.  The special features disc has an interview with actors that knew Stan in his golden years.  Would have liked to have heard more about Oliver's life.  It would have been nice if they had a feature that covered Stan and Oliver's lives.  Oh, well...it's a good collection of their best work none the less.",1390780800,,571,4.495145631067961
4650711,4,B005BYBZKY,"This release includes about all the Hal Roach Laurel and Hardy shorts and features. The material is somewhat battered in places but clearly comes from early-generation sources with resultant fine picture quality. There are a few commentary tracks, no subtitles. Even a few foreign-language versions, filmed in the language, are included. There are no subtitles.

Early in the transition from silent to sound films, the sound was recorded on disc and the picture filled the full picture area on the 35mm film. Later, the picture area was reduced to allow for a sound track on the film.
Here, the earliest L & H shorts have been processed through equipment with the smaller frame, resulting in cropping the image on the left side. This is quite noticeable but does not interfere with enjoyment of the fine classics.

The packaging is excellent. The ten discs are easily removed and replaced, each has good liner notes, and the full 10-disc package takes up just over one inch of shelf space.

This is a must for those who love Laurel and Hardy films, also for those not yet familiar with their classic form of comedy.",1390694400,,1115,4.827225130890052

4650713,4,B005BYBZKY,"They've done a good job in restoring such valuable vintage material and most of the Hal Roach shorts you remember from your childhood are here. The only slight problem is, they're not quite as funny as I remember them back then! But hey, we live in an age where we're bombarded with slick humor and these are pure slapstick from a more classic era, so it's just a matter of adjusting. What they undoubtedly are is a great study in history, especially the exterior scenes, the cars, etc. And the movie-making ambition cannot be faulted: for the episode involving them as kids they actually built giant rooms and a massive staircase so the stars appear child-sized: who needs CGI! Now that the price has crashed down this set is great value, with 10 discs in all. And I'm sure I'll be back in tune with the humor by the time I get to the end.",1390435200,,840,4.425806451612903

Timing is everything  as I found an after Christmas sale on Laurel and Hardy: The Essential Collection at one third the list price. That is 5 star number one. Five star number two is the unique 5 1/2 X 7 5/8 book like case with sleeves for each disk. Five star number three are the sound and visual quality of these disks, by far the best of any other L&H DVD's I have. Five star number four are the liner notes displayed neat and clean, along with  year and length of movie with cast members. Five star number five is disk number 10, the special features. That is 25 stars. WOW. This product is a MUST HAVE for any Laurel and Hardy fan. More than 33 hours of ""Classic Golden Age of Hollywood Comedy"". I have slowly watched these classics, 2 a day instead of a 2 or 3 day marathon
to replicate watching WPIX-TV in the 1950's anticipating the next days short or Saturday feature. Take time to see my review on The Beau Hunks play the Original Laurel and Hardy Music, Candy, Candy.",1390176000,,1122,4.312796208530806
4650716,5,B005BYBZKY,"I am so happy I bought this collection! For years I have looked for these films in a Laurel & Hardy package. These films are just as hilarious today as they were when they were made. All the items that I purchased prior had the least funny stuff done by them. When I was younger I used to watch ""Comedy Classics"" which would alternate each Friday and it would have ""The Three Stooges"" one week and the next would be ""Laurel & Hardy"". It showed some of the great stuff but later when Videos and DVD's came out you only had very small collections and they were the least funny of ""Laurel & Hardy"". Years later my kids loved ""The Three Stooges"" like me and I always told them how funny ""L & H"" were but until now I never as they say had the proof to back what I had been saying. But that all has changed now since I got this collection. My boys are teenagers and they ask me when we get time to watch ""L & H"" now. They laugh every bit as much as I do and did when I was younger. The quality of the picture, package and sound is great! One other thing I would like to mention is that it still amazes me how the classic comedians were able to provide side splitting laughter without having to use a bit of profanity. There isn't many that could accomplish this nowadays. THIS PACKAGE IS A MUST HAVE if you like ""Laurel & Hardy"" or just plain want to laugh good and hard!",1390089600,,1365,4.078066914498141

The first short on the first disc had distorted audio but all of the other selections were fine. That must have been the best version they could find of that film. This collection does NOT have any of their classic silent short films. Hopefully someday a set of these will be available in the U.S. The silent films are some of the best comedy ever committed to celluloid. That said, I had a wonderful holiday watching these hilarious L&H classics.",1389052800,,583,4.5

I watched the set in order and was enjoying one of my favorite short films (Blockheads) when it became unwatchable about 2/3 of the way in (kept stopping and starting)! I was pretty upset since I had been looking forward to this one in particular! I did remove the discs from the cardboard sleeves (to plastic cases) immediately after receiving them because of the reviews on here, but I guess this was just a bad disc to begin with. I haven't tried to watch the rest of the set, yet, but I'm going to have to find another copy of Blockheads someplace. I will keep the set because there are still some quality movies and shorts that I will enjoy watching over and over again!",1388361600,4,813,4.3907284768211925
4650722,5,B005BYBZKY,"This is a great set, and glad I bought it. It also includes the Spanish version of many shows, something the producer wanted to do to get a larger viewing audience, that being said, I don't see why they included these Spanish shows in the set, why not just produce another in Spanish? Anyway, for what ever reason, it is fun to watch all the characters actually speak Spanish, which they really do, not subtitled, really speaking the language, and is subtitled in English. But there is only one Spanish show per disc, and oddly, the Spanish version of the same English show is longer.

 I have only watched the first disk so far, and the quality is very good. I see no skipping, or film lines or any degradation like you would if you saw the original as is. After all, these are very old films, and they look like they were just made, only in black and white. If your a fan of Laurel & Hardy, this is a must have set.",1388275200,,917,4.264367816091954

4650730,5,B005BYBZKY,I've been after this set for some time but when it arrived unfortunately the contents were damaged (again). This is the second set that came with scratched and marred discs so obviously the manufacturer's own case (which is just ten cardboard slots) cannot protect the set  from damage.

It is actually a little book with each of the 10 DVDs getting 2 pages with the details of the films (one of which is the DVD slip case).

Today's so-called comedies are filthy (such as ""The Heat"" where two women try to be Lauren and Heidi and are truly tasteless and nasty).  Laurel and Hardy were comic masters and even children can safelty view their products.

The picture and sound quality are very good and some of the films that were re-released in the '30s with new sound tracks are featured with both tracks to choose from. There is some additional material, including an interesting tribute to L&H featuring Dick Van Dyke and Jerry Lewis. Lewis tells a ridiculously erroneous story of how L&H met, which set me to grinding my teeth, but I watched another film and my joy was restored before serious dental damage was incurred.",1379462400,2,512,4.764044943820225

The packaging is stylish with plenty of information and the remastering and sound quality is perfect. All I had to do was sit back, enjoy the show and laugh for the thousandth time at scenes I have seen over and over before. Timeless fun and to think they are still making people laugh over 80 years after plying their trade makes me wish I'd been around to experience them in the old time movie theatres.",1379462400,2,635,4.482758620689655
4650737,5,B005BYBZKY,"The boys are the greatest comedy team in history.  They have an affection for each other that is obvious on screen. Their gags go way beyond slapstick and into a different level of comedy for the time.  Even though they started silent, their transition to talkies was  seamless and was enhanced by dialogue.

Unfortunately, excepted for the ""foreign versions"" of their shorts (shot in Spanish or French), they forgot to add English subs. For the 21-discs British set, some years ago, it was even more stupid, they put English subs on ALL their movies shot in English and none for the foreign versions.

4650763,5,B005BYBZKY,"I agree with other reviewers about the quality of this set being excellent. I am glad to have it. It exceeds the fine quality of a more complete collection of Laurel and Hardy/Hal Roach shorts and feature movies I have on DVD from Nostalgia Family Video out of Baker City, OR. I picked those up years ago.

What is disappointing to me about this new ten disc set is that quite a few of the Laurel and Hardy feature films are missing. Some can be hard to find. Features such as the timeless Babes in Toyland (AKA, March Of The Wooden Soldiers), Flying Deuces, Bogus Bandits and Bonnie Scotland to name a few. If fitting everything to ten DVD's was important for marketing and pricing, I would have rather seen more of their feature films included instead of the French and Spanish language shorts. Just my opinion. Others may think otherwise. Thank goodness the wonderful feature Bohemian Girl is included in this set. It is my favorite. A real treasure among so many treasures Laurel and Hardy gave us.

Missing features or not, if you like them as I do, this Laurel and Hardy collection deserves a place on your DVD shelf. A must have.

Thank you Stan and Ollie for coming along when you did! And, you too Hal Roach for your vision!!",1365811200,2,1234,4.5

Actually, those are the ones that I've watched so far, and I have been very happy. At the end of the day, sometimes a not so good day, I have sat down in front of the TV and watched a few of the shorts, and my mood was changed completely.

Most of the videos have been restored and in many cases you have a choice of which soundtrack version would you prefer. The choice is usually the original release or the re-release. The only thing I didn't like was the mixing of English and Spanish versions on the same DVD. I would have preferred to have the Spanish version all on one set of disks.

4650789,5,B005BYBZKY,"I hadn't seen any Laurel and Hardy in at least 20 years, and I was never that familiar with them.  That being said, this collection is a tremendous set of 2 reel and longer works done for Hal Roach Studios.

Laurel and Hardy were just brilliant comedians.  Laurel was a genius, and Hardy's ability to engage the audience has never been matched. The shorts are my favorites with the Music Box (of course) and the Laurel and Hardy Murder case being on top.  Though, Sons of the Desert is just amazing as well.  The specials aren't too bad either.  I appreciated the impact that Stan Laurel had on the lives of Dick Van Dyke and Jerry Lewis.  Imagine finding a star like Stan Laurel in the phone book today!

My only complaint is the lack of subtitles, but I had very little issue with the dialogue.  Helps that a lot of the comedy is silent (going back to the silent movies).",1363478400,,873,4.372670807453416

I say this in the way that had this been a box set of something you love dearly, say like ""Arrested Development"", ""The Godfather"", ""The Complete Works of Edgar Allen Poe"" [insert your all-time favorite media subject] you'd say it was amazing,

You will read many of reviews that tell you all of its contents so I will save you that. But just to tell you what I think of this set: It is just beautiful in every way, from how the discs are laid out, to the film quality, to the summaries and added material,

So really, the only thing disappointing thing would be the lack of silent shorts. But one can only hope and pray that those will be out someday soon, and it's box set layout and quality be comparable to this set. And once those are out then you will have an amazing collection of one of the most historic and hilarious comedy teams in movie history.

If every box set was this beautiful, more people would probably download less.

The biggest is that I would like to learn more about the team, each actor, even if it's limited to the years at Hal Roach Studios.  When you look at many other box sets and commemorative releases, there's a real attention it seems toward giving the purchaser a more complete experience.  The few commentary tracks and a 40 minute tribute by Jerry Lewis, Dick V Dyke and Tim Conway are fine, but a lengthy documentary would be preferred.  Or else a book that gives more background on the history of the team either overall or at least during the period covered in the set: 1929-1940.  It just feels incomplete to me.

Also, a minor annoyance is that the book of DVDs, while very attractive, is difficult to remove from the outer cover.

Of course, my complaints are not with Amazon.  The content of the set is clearly written in their description.  I just feel that, for a $100 list price, there should be provided a more complete experience.  Still, highly recommended, especially if you can get it from Amazon at a good price (maybe $60 or less).  Thanks for reading.",1354752000,4,1329,4.495833333333334
4650825,5,B005BYBZKY,"I bought this last winter and was very pleased with it. This is a 10 DVD set that contains all of Laurel & Hardy's films during their Hal Roach years. It has Spanish versions of some films and audio commentaries as well. There is also a 'Then and now' featurette, which goes to various locations where movies were shot and shows you what it looks like now. Most notable was the long stairs in ""The Musci Box"" There is also a booklet that provides  a wealth of information about Laurel & Hardy. If you only purchase one set of Laurel & Hardy movies, this set would have to be it.

4650829,5,B005BYBZKY,"I have been carrying around some 15 VHS tapes with some 50 movies/shorts on them for 20 years.  Oh sure, I'd find a L&H movie or two on this DVD pack, or that, but it just wasn't worth it.
Now - just about every L&H movie I want (Except for full-lengths Utopia and Flying Deuces) are in one collection PLUS many ones I have never seen!

The case is a trophy in and of itself - filled with details about the movies and stars, and fun trivia.
Plus, you get to see different language versions of these movies - and when I say different, I don't mean dubbed. I mean L&H are speaking Spanish and French (better than I can, anyway) and these international counterparts have extended scenes!

The extras disc is also good, with a one hour documentary on L&H as told my comedians including Dick van Dyke, Jerry Lewis, Penn and Teller and more. And there are bonus movies such as The Little Rascals in which L&H make cameo (albeit very brief) appearances.

Plus, at least one (so far) movie - Laughing Gravy - had an alternate ending. Nice!

Suffice it to say that this is a nicely-packaged, 'book-style' collection of L&H sound era shorts and features (under the Hal Roach banner). The material is presented in chronological order, which takes the 'ummm, let's see where to start' out of the equation. The set also contains simultaneaously-shot foreign versions, with captions, that often use alternate takes and combine scenes from more than one short to pad the presentation - hidden gems there. One complaint has been about the 'tight' page slots that some claim damaged discs. Apparently the manufacturer heard your complaints and now the discs are in protective sleeves inside the slots.

I liked the commentary that Tim Conway did on the bonus disk.  If you watch some of the stuff he did on McHale's Navy you can see where he got his inspiration from for sure.

4650833,5,B005BYBZKY,"Well, I must say this is a fascinating product.  I have been a long time fan of Laurel and Hardy. So here is a 10 DVD set full of amazing Laurel and Hardy films. Almost all of the MGM and United Artist 'talkies' are here.

The good:
Most of the films are the best and sharpest I have ever seen!!!  Some of them are stunning!
When I was younger I used to collect old movies (16mm and 8mm) and the picture quality was never that great. Even the more recent releases on DVD were never that good.
I am projecting these in my home theater (panasonic pt ae 3000 projector) and the picture and sharpness look great (120"" screen!) (with a few exceptions).  Also, the sound quality is very good. It is obvious that these were original (or close to original) negatives that were carefully remastered.

The bad:
I like the packaging.  It is really clever.  But, it could drive an impatient person crazy.  I think of Laurel and Hardy having a good laugh when you are trying to pull out and replace a disc.
The movie SONS OF THE DESERT (one of my very favorites) seems to vary in picture quality from normal to soft contrast from scene to scene.  Its not that bad, but you can sure see it.  I remember seeing SONS OF THE DESERT on 16mm film and it had the same problem with the contrast.  I thought they might have fixed it by now.
And, (this will be debated forever...) is it right to just digitally copy the films with little or no clean up? I do admit the movies look very, very sharp, but there are some distracting moments of film damage (splices, glue residue, etc.)  that could be fixed digitally.
And... There are no subtitles (i.e. closed captioning, except on some of the spanish titles).

Summary:
If you love L&H you need to get this collection.  You have never seen these movies look and sound so good!",1349049600,4,1802,4.3562874251497
4650834,5,B005BYBZKY,"There is a lot going on in the world today. One look at the headlines on Drudge is enough to get me down. That's why Laurel and Hardy are needed now more than ever. We need a bit more innocent humor, and Stan and Ollie knew how to deliver. I'm not sure why it has taken so long for the Boys to make their way to DVD, but it was well worth the wait! Here, for the first time in the United States, is the majority of their Hal Roach material from the ""talking period"" (I hope their silent shorts come to DVD soon!).
There are some great ones in this set, including the hilarious, and maybe darn near perfect ""Helpmates."" The way Stan delivers some of his lines, and the facial expressions of Ollie, are hilarious in that one! The wonderful feature-length film ""Sons of the Desert"" is included, and in my opinion may be the funniest movie ever made. Even the less-than-great L&H shorts are worth watching, with enough laughs to keep you entertained. If you're a fan, then you've probably already picked up this set. If you are not familiar with Laurel and Hardy, do yourself a favor and get acquainted. It's almost impossible to have a bad day when hanging out with those two.",1348185600,3,1173,4.385321100917431

4650836,5,B005BYBZKY,"At last I was able to buy this 10 DVD set of at least 58 Laurel & Hardy shorts and feature films -- a compact book-album that replaces over a hundred of my worn-out video tapes.  (Besides, who still has a VCR today?  This collection is near-perfect in many ways with tributes from Dick Van Dyke, Jerry Lewis, Tim Conway and others, with location scenes as they are today, and with theatrical trailers.
  It could only be improved by printing the ""Foreword"" and ""Contents"" pages not with small white type over black background, but the easy legible way -- black type over a light tint background like the other pages.  And the ""protective"" envelopes are a nuisance; the discs will not be harmed by simply inserting them into the page pockets.  No need to struggle with the envelopes.  Trash them.
  This collection includes foreign language versions of some of their films -- hysterical in Spanish or French.  Thanks to Rob Birarelli (Past Glorious Sheik of Leave 'Em Laughing, the Greater Bridgeport Sons of the Desert Tent - Oasis 211) for recommending this purchase.  Funny, Historic, and Educational.  You can discover where the Three Stooges stole the ""eye poke"" and other ideas (from Way Out West, Towed In A Hole, and others).
  The DVD format allows a scene to be paused; and you can ""rewind"" to see in slo-mo their intricate gags and routines.  Each re-run is likely to reveal something you did not notice before.  Stan and Ollie have a personal meaning: my late father, who introduced me to The Boys when their shorts aired on WPIX-TV in the fifties and who looked like Ollie's twin brother, did perfect interpretations, especially as a painter and carpenter.###",1347840000,3,1671,4.79020979020979
4650837,5,B005BYBZKY,"Essential is the correct title here.  Not too many will dispute that Laurel & Hardy's best films were made during the Roach period.  Hardcore fans like myself have been frustrated for many, many years waiting for something other than a half-assed collection to be released. (...in the States, that is.)  Even though it's not every single film they ever made, it is definitely a complete collection from an era.  ALL of the sound shorts are here, as well as all of the features Roach still has the rights to.  This fact alone easily makes this the place to start when looking for a L&H collection- it's a no-brainer.

Although these movies have not been formally ""restored,"" (UCLA is working on that as I speak) they have been cleaned up nicely, and are the best quality prints (and in some cases, the ONLY prints) you can find in the U.S. at the moment.  Are they perfect?- No.  These films are 70-80 years old!  But they look great on my 52-inch TV.  Some films are better looking than others, but all are the best I've seen in years.  Proof of this is the fact that I am seeing background details in the films that I've never noticed before, and it feels like I'm re-discovering these films for the first time.  This is another great reason to buy this set, even if you've seen these films over and over through the years.

Even though the packaging isn't the ideal choice, I've had NO ISSUES with the DVDs acquiring scratches.  I have watched all ten of the discs numerous times, and not a scratch on any of them.  I think the bigger worry should be getting fingerprint smudges on the DVDs.  They can be a little hard to get out of the slips if you shove them way back in there, but as long as you're mindful of that, it's no big deal at all.  That being said, I really like the book-style packaging.  The first page tells you which films are on each DVD, like a quick reference- very nice.  The following pages are color-coded to each disc, and list the films on that particular DVD, complete with synopses and interesting facts about the movies.  The packaging is sturdy, with the look and feel of a book.  The artwork design also deserves to be mentioned.  I honestly think it's the first time I've seen a L&H package design that wasn't a complete embarrassment, now that I think about it!  Anyway, they really put a lot of care into the overall package, and it's built to last for years.

I also believe the foreign language versions are an essential part of this set.  I had never seen any of these before this was released.  I enjoyed the extra gags (and generally longer running times) that were cut from the English versions.  More for hardcore fans, but essential nonetheless.  They didn't leave anything important out of the set to put these foreign releases in, so worst-case scenario: no harm done.

The extras are also well justified.  Included on the last DVD are three shorts where L&H make a cameo appearance. (a Pitts/Todd film called ""On The Loose,"" a Rascals short called ""Wild Poses,"" and a Charlie Chase film called ""On The Wrong Trek."")  There is also a documentary, a sort of tribute, that is worth a watch or two. (Jerry Lewis kind of got on my nerves with some misinformation and being generally over-dramatic, but Dick Van Dyke is awesome.)  My favorite part, however, is a feature that shows you various scenes from L&H films, then shows you what that place looks like today.  My only gripe about it is that it could have been an hour or two longer!  Other than that, there are a few trailers, and a one-reel propaganda WWII film about... Wood?  It's a snoozer, but it's in color, so it's worth the ten-or-so minutes, at least once.

Amazon is asking $67 at the moment.  For 32 hours of entertainment, it's a steal.

I have waited for years and years (and YEARS) for someone to get the rights to these films that would actually put some effort into a decent release, and finally give these two geniuses the respect they deserve... It was worth the wait.

SIDE NOTE FOR COMPLETISTS:  If you want to fill in the gaps to complete your ""Roach Years"" collection, the missing movies are readily available.  TCM released a nice looking two-disc set with Fra Diavolo and Bonnie Scotland.  Included in this set are some real nice extras.  For example, a very interesting documentary about the whole short film era, (Not limited just to L&H) and more importantly, most (if not all?) of the cameos they've done in other movies that weren't included in the Essential box set. (Pick A Star & Rogue Song, etc., come to mind.)  There are also plenty of releases of March Of The Wooden Soldiers and Flying Deuces out there, so those aren't hard to find.  So if you buy...

The Essential Collection
Fra Diavolo/Bonnie Scotland (TCM)
March Of The Wooden Soldiers
Flying Deuces

...you will have every film they've made from their first talkie in 1929 through 1940 when they left Roach and went to Fox.

Speaking of, I'm pretty sure the Fox movies are also easy to find.

Atoll K (Utopia) has been out in crappy prints forever, since it's in the public domain. (I believe Flying Deuces is too..?)

This release was well worth the wait, and with so many positive reviews posted I wasn't about to chime in my two cents, except...

It would be nice to some day see the Laurel and Hardy silent shorts being given the same quality treatment. I know that I'm not the only one out there that wants the silent shorts as well.

Any of the shorts with Thelma Todd or Mae Bush are especially great.  And the ones where they play multiple roles (Twice Two, Our Relations, Brats)are hilarious.

4650847,5,B005BYBZKY,"Most people reading this likely have no need to read about the shorts themselves, so this review is a product review:

I haven't had time to watch all the shorts, but the ones I watched look pretty good, considering that they're anywhere from 70-80 years old.  Way Out West, the only feature I've watched so far, looks good.  Sound quality is decent.

I was fascinated by the foreign language versions, particularly when comparing the Spanish language audio to the subtitle translations, which are sometimes paraphrased significantly.  I'm glad they included the ones they did, as they are quite different from their counterparts.

The extra shorts and the trailers on the tenth disc were enjoyable.  A Tribute to Laurel and Hardy and On Location With The boys were good, though I doubt I'll ever watch them again.

I don't normally talk about things like packaging, particularly when there's controversy.  People see things differently.  But I had almost no trouble getting the DVDs out of the packaging and I have manual dexterity problems because I have Cerebral Palsy, which makes my hands shake.  The set I got has paper sleeves inserted in the cardboard sleeves, to further protect the discs.  For me, the packaging isn't a problem and it looks very nice, it looks like a book in a slipcase and the discs are in sleeves with the information about the contents printed on the sleeves.

Given that you get 10 discs and nice looking, good quality packaging, the price is decent.  Most recommended.",1339200000,3,1500,4.900793650793651

The only ones that  I don't have are the lost films and any  discovered in the past year  that have yet to appear on dvd. It is essential  for any L&H buff that they have the early silent shorts BEFORE they were a team . It is ludicrous  in having  their films  in your collection if you don't have the silents.

4650851,4,B005BYBZKY,"First the bad:  Before I purchased I read all of the reviews, and it appeared the problems with scratches were pretty much solved with the paper sleeves they started using.  Either they are shipping out dvd's that were previously sent back, or they still have a problem in quality control (mishandled during production or in packaging).  Also, some of the slots were incredibly tight, and the paper sleeves don't cover the tiny area you are obviously supposed to grab the dvd's at. Can't be that hard to fix the problem.  They should keep the dvd's separate from the booklet for starters, and house the dvd's more appropriately.  I read a review where someone said some people will complain about anything.  Great that their's came free of problems, however scratches that run from one side of the dvd to the other, are unacceptable.  Customers have to complain or the problem will never be solved.  I've never sent anything back to Amazon, but this I have asked for a replacement for.  I did buy 10 empty cases to put them in and they are cheap.  Bought 10 for $4.99 at a local store.

As for the comedy itself, these two men are the best.  Growing up during the 70's and early 80's I only saw a couple of L&H movies on tv.  Loved them and always wanted to see more rather than the Three Stooges, which were ok, but were on all the time.  Besides I much preferred L&H. Then while stationed overseas in the military on a lonely off day I decided to borrow a couple of comedies from the library on base.  Checked out two L&H movies and they totally changed my mood and outlook that affected me greatly, in a good way of course.  Since that time I've only seen a handful of their movies, some were ones I'd already seen.  So until I bought this set I probably saw at most six or seven of their shorts or features.  So as you can imagine I was very pleased to see The Essential Collection available, and for a good sale price of $50.49.

Received it yesterday and watched the first six on the first dvd.  Really great stuff.  Not having seen most of the early 'talking' shorts, I saw a dynamic I didn't expect.  Not only was Oliver striking and strangling Stanley, but Stanley striking and strangling back, then Oliver getting mad saying, ""Don't you hit me"", while hitting Stanley again.  Obviously, the blows were not big heavy ones, basically slapping.  But seeing the little guy putting his hands around the big guys neck was indeed hilarious, considering their comedic abilities.  Other things that were new to me was hearing Oliver refer to Stanley as ""Stany"", unless I heard wrong, and Oliver repeatedly asking Stanley, ""Why don't you don't something for me?"".  Most people who read these reviews are L&H 'experts' it seems, but for anyone who reads this review that hasn't seen alot of their films, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  No, I know you will.  Neat to see them younger than in most of the ones I've watched previously.

Picture quality seems fine to me, especially considering these were made as far back as the 1920's.  I'm thrilled these shorts and features were available still and assembled for the public to purchase.  Hate to give this less than five stars, but when five out of ten dvd's come with scratches on them, I have to deduct at least one star.  Nothing personal 'Boys'.",1337904000,4,3307,4.5809199318569

I am more than satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend Laurel & Hardy's ""Essential Collection"" to anyone interested in the timeless comedy of this enduring duo.",1337385600,3,683,4.973684210526316

4650855,5,B005BYBZKY,"Absolutely stunning video quality! After years of buying super 8 sound prints and then collecting stuff on dvd from tv, this collection is the ultimate treasure.  I am throwing away all my home recorded DVDs and selling my super 8 sound films.  I got a great price on it but it is worth any price.

Now about that documentary, A Tribute to Laurel and Hardy.  What was Jerry Lewis smoking just before they recorded his part?  He makes up a lovely dream that had about as much truth to it as there was comic restraint in the vast majority of his films.  The Bellboy is the only film of his I can stand to watch but then he made it as a tribute to the Stan.  Stan's prints are all over it.

Don't even hesitate, buy this collection.  There will never be anything better!",1336953600,,767,4.270833333333333

4650858,3,B005BYBZKY,"At long last the complete Laurel and Hardy Roach collection. First the good points. Every sound short as well as the several of the Roach features are included. All films contain the original release opening titles, and several of the foreign versions are included. Some long lost versions are available. A new complete print of ""Men O' War"" 1929 is restored to it's original version, and the long lost 1929 version of ""A Perfect Day"" is available. The 1931 film ""Come Clean"" is BEAUTIFUL. Every L & H buff have been waiting years for this collection, and it's worth every penny. Now for the bad stuff. The line ""Laurel & Hardy have never looked better."" is false. Take a look at some of the 16mm Blackhawk prints to see how these films should really look. True the films are ""Restored"" however, the Film Classic negatives are used with original opening titles added. The prints are somewhat ""dupey"" looking at times with titles like ""Oliver the Eighth"" downright horrible. The biggest disappointment however is the feature ""Pardon Us"". They used the pre-view version of this title which has been around since the 1980's. This version runs 70 minutes, and there is a reason why it was trimmed to 56 minutes. The 70 minute version is just not as good. The fire scene towards the end of the film was missing the sound element, and has been crudly dubbed, and the extra footage is meaningless. I don't mind seeing the ""extended"" version, but why not include the original release version as well? All in all, a good buy and we have been waiting so long to own a set like this, but it's far from perfect.",1333065600,9,1599,4.633802816901408
4650859,5,B005BYBZKY,"After waiting years for a package of these films to be made available in a restored  condition, it is finally here.  I was most interested in the L & H short films, sometimes called ""two reelers"" and they appear to be all here in this collection.  This is the only really good print of the legendary ""Music Box"" short I've yet seen on DVD.  Even the soundtrack that was always plagued with pops and  bumps has been cleaned up.  I don't have any complaints with any of the items I've auditioned thus far.  The earliest films (1929) appear to be in the roughest shape particularly in regards to the audio, which is understandable as that was the first year optical synchronized soundtracks came into general use.

Some reviewers noted small deposits of adhesive material on some discs of this set and I noted it on two or three of mine -- apparently it was the adhesive used to bond the pages of the book container that had migrated into the disc storage area.  These were easily removed using a facial tissue saturated with isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol.  Most adhesives are dissolved by IP alcohol but the discs will not  be damaged as the polycarbonate plastic used for all discs (CD, DVD and BD) is resistant to alcohol.  Normally I use ammonia-free Windex (which contains a small amount of alcohol ) to clean my discs when necessary and wipe them dry with a facial tissue.

Speaking of the book container, I like it very much.  The contents of each disc are listed on each page providing release dates, running times, cast and director plus details pertaining to the films.  Most of these discs each have a total running time of nearly three hours.  There are a total of fifty-eight films in this collection that were produced by the Hal Roach studio and released by MGM.  The listed running time for the  complete set is 32 hours and 17 minutes!  The films are arranged in the order of release dates.  Pulling the DVDs out of the pockets of the booklet with your fingertips is a little tricky to avoid finger smudges, but they are, after all, easily removed.

To see and hear the marvelous restoration of these great films (especially the hard to find shorts) was for me a very happy experience.  The set may be a bit pricey, but it is beautifully produced and worth every cent.",1332892800,,2280,4.5777777777777775
4650860,5,B005BYBZKY,"There has never been or will ever be anyone to outdo these two in the art of comedy. Stan Laurel was the brains of the team creating and writing most of the comedic situations they found themselves in. But,it was Oliver Hardy's timing that was paramount to it working on screen as he was usually the butt of the joke. They both worked so well off one another it was as if they were one.
This is an excellent DVD from Vivendi that has all of their sound shorts and some of their best movies. But it is the shorts that make this DVD.The movies are good, but,because of it's longer running time the gags are not as fast paced. Although the gags are just as funny and worth waiting for. My favourite is ""Sons of the Desert"".I consider this to be their best movie followed by ""Way out West"" and ""Block-Heads"".Although ""Sons of the Desert"" is a movie where the gags come thick and fast as in their short films.
I have seen all these shows before but they never stop me from laughing at them and that's it. No matter how many times you see them they still make you laugh. They never stop being funny.
While I was over in the States I happened to be travelling through, Harlem,Georgia birthplace of Oliver Hardy. I visited the Laurel and Hardy museum that is there. It's full of memorabilia to look at. We were escorted to a room at the back where they have screenings of their shows. I was with thirty other people. They say laughter is contagious. It certainly was. I came out of that museum in tears as I had been laughing so much. So did the people who viewed the show with me. Luckily it was one of the shorts they played as if I had been there any longer I would have needed an oxygen mask to help me breathe. I was laughing so much.
Extra's on this DVD include commentaries from Laurel and Hardy film historians. If you like behind the scenes info about films and shows like I do,you will appreciate these. There are trailers for some of their films and an interactive map on where the films were shot. Also tributes from Jerry Lewis and Dick Van Dyke.
There are foreign language shorts here of Laurel and Hardy as well. These weren't sub-titled when originally shot but were re-shot in Spanish or French with the actors speaking in that language. These were actually extended in length with new gags added. On this DVD we have the option of sub-titles so we can follow along.
Also a special mention must be added here about James Finlayson. He appears in some of these shows and he is just as funny. Just looking at his face makes me laugh.
Usually, when writing a review I try to keep it short and concise so as to not  bore the reader. I failed here as there is so much to say. Also when I write these reviews I hope the people who read them agree with my opinion because it is only, my opinion. But on this occasion I guarantee that you will love this DVD and will be glad you bought it.
The world is a little bit poorer that these two gentlemanly gentleman are no longer with us. But it is also a little bit richer for the legacy of comedy they left behind for us to enjoy.
God Bless them wherever they are.",1332115200,5,3111,4.272881355932204
4650861,5,B005BYBZKY,"For years, the only Laurel and Hardy films in my DVD library were the two Hallmark Home Entertainment collections ""Laurel & Hardy"" and ""Laurel & Hardy 2"" (both now out of print). That problem has been solved with ""The Essential Collection."" Now, on ten discs, I own all of the classic talkies from the Hal Roach Studios.

I pre-ordered this in July and so far have only watched the first two discs, and I couldn't be happier with this collection. I even got my college-age daughter (who is minoring in Spanish) to watch ""Ladrones"" with me. (I learned that ""tonto"" means ""stupid."" Makes me wonder about the Lone Ranger!) It was also a history lesson for me to discover that Laurel and Hardy would reshoot entire films (sometimes nearly doubling the original length) for their foreign language audience AND actually do their own dialogue!

I developed a love of old comedies when I was in high school, when on the weekends local stations would show Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields and Laurel and Hardy films. Now these, along with the Three Stooges, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Hope & Crosby, Abbott & Costello, make up the bulk of my DVD collection. Why? Because nobody in the last fifty years have been funnier than any of them. I'm looking forward to hours of laughs watching the next eight discs. If you enjoy classic comedies, this is the mother lode for Laurel & Hardy fans. ESSENTIAL",1330905600,6,1401,4.737704918032787

We would rather that the Spanish versions were not in this set, but a few more of their works, but it is still great.  We share these also with our grandchildren who have come to know the likes of Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, and the Marx Brothers as well as the Three Stooges!

4650863,5,B005BYBZKY,"When i first heard about this set being made i was exstatic. But upon viewing the shorts and movies i don't really believe the best source material was used.
Example: The short ""Me and my Pal"" i personally own a vhs copy of this short and it looks 10 times better than the one that was used in creating this set. It is a Sp mode vhs tape. The one used in this set had streaky lines throughout and a weird twirly one on the bottom right. My vhs copy of this short has none of those things. My vhs copy looks more HD than what the one used claimed to be. I'm not saying i don't appreciate that this caliber of Laurel and Hardy material was given to us in bulk form. I'm just saying if they are gonna claim it is DIGITALLY REMASTERED AND DIGITALLY RESTORED.Live up to what you claim is all.
Example: when They released The original Psycho on DVD  and Bluray and claimed it was cleaned up and restored and HD at least what they claimed is true. The cleaned up Psycho looks like it was Filmed in HD yesterday. Surely There is authentic Totally clean and dirt,streak free prints of all this material in private hands out there.",1330041600,2,1121,4.238317757009346
4650864,5,B005BYBZKY,"I was thrilled to see this nearly complete collection finally offered for purchase.  However, I almost didn't purchase it due to a few bad reviews complaining about the packaging and ""scratches"" and glue spots on the DVDs caused by it.

I decided to take a chance and order it anyway and boy am I glad that I did!  I don't know what those clowns were talking about.  While they are correct that the DVDs are contained within a cardboard ""book"" with each cardboard ""page"" being a sleeve that holds each disk, my set has an internal plastic sleeve inside each ""page"" that protects the disk and allows you to slide the disk in and out without scratching or damaging it.  A few of the plastic sleeves were a little hard to get in and out, but I just spread the cardboard page open slightly more and now each plastic sleeve slides in and out quite nicely.

As for scratches or glue spots, I have seen none and after watching over half the collection have had no issues with playback.  Those complainers must be anal retentive types who are using a microscope to find these ""scratches"".

I'm glad I didn't listen to them and you'll be glad too if you you order this collection.  Since this is the ""Essential Collection"" and not the ""Complete"" collection, there are a couple of good detailed reviews on the website by Scott MacGillivray and Eric Perlin that give you lots of facts and also will tell you how to round out your collection.

4650865,4,B005BYBZKY,"Finally a collection of L&H videos all in one.  For quite some time I've had trouble searching databases at sources such as Blockbuster.  If I ordered something, I wouldn't know what I would get.  And it always seemed the most available item was ""Utopia.""

But the ""Essential Collection"" has L&H shorts that I haven't seen since I was a kid.  And of the shorts or full-features that I have seen more recently, I'll certainly be glad to watch them again.

There's a lot to look forward to in the 9-disc ""Collection.""  Plus, theres a 10th ""Special Features"" disc.

The reason that I didn't give the ""Collection"" a 5 star rating is that only the 'talking' videos are included.  Over a couple years or so in the late 1920s, L&H had filmed some silent productions.  And I know there's at least one silent video that I really want to get my hands on.

4650872,5,B005BYBZKY,"This set is amazing!  I purchased this set at the beginning of December and finished watching it in its entirety today.  I must say if you love Laurel and Hardy you owe it to yourself to pick this set up! No doubt I will repeat some things which have already been said but it is unlikely that everyone reads each and every review so a periodic repetition of some points may be helpful to someone who does not care to dig deep within the review pile.

Pros:

1. Outstanding quality for the most part. A few are not as good as old videos I have but again most are outstanding and as good as we may ever see.
2. Shorts and features are in sequential order. Nice to watch this way.
3. Includes all talking shorts and most features up to 1940.
4. 2 commentaries each on Hog Wild, Another Fine Mess, Sons of the Desert, and Way Out West.  Interesting comments to be heard here.
5. Spanish versions which are not dubbed and actually longer of Night Owls, Blotto, Below Zero, Berth Marks, Chickens Come Home, Be Big and Laughing Gravy.  These last two also come in French Versions!
6. Nice presentation in book format with summaries on each page for that disc.
7. The 10th disc has some nice extras.

Cons:
1. Really the only con I can think of and it has been discussed at length here in reviews is the storage for the discs.  Unfortunately it lends itself to fingerprints and scratches. They are not easily removed folks. Since I purchased the set they have now added paper sleeves. This helps somewhat but discs can still get scratched even in paper sleeves. I simply did as many here suggested and took the discs out carefully and placed all in slimline plastic holders.  They are all scratchfree and all played perfectly.

So there you have it.  Considering this set? Do it, get it now.  :)",1326240000,10,1787,4.414634146341464

Regarding the restoration - I'm no film expert and I've not seen every version of these films for comparison, however, as a serious classic movie fan, the films look great!  Especially considering their age.  Old films are gems and sometimes they contain a rough spot or two or three, but I think the quality of these films is far more than adequate - the films look great!

Three key features are missing fom this set: FRA DIAVALO (THE DEVIL'S BROTHER), BABES IN TOYLAND and BONNIE SCOTLAND. The reason is that in the early 1940's M-G-M bought back these three features from Roach and now owns the negatives and distribution rights.  FRA DIAVALO and TOYLAND were costume operettas, and it seems M-G-M goofed and what they really wanted was a 3rd such comic opera, THE BOHEMIAN GIRL but somehow ended up with BONNIE SCOTLAND instead.

4650884,5,B005BYBZKY,"I have been a Laurel and Hardy fan since I was a young boy. There were frequent showing of some of their shorts and films on television and of course ""March Of The Wooden Soldiers"" every Christmas. And I have loved them from the first time I saw them, how could anyone not?. The love these two men had for each other, on and off the screen were always well known. It was inevitable that Hal Roach, their producer, would eventually team them up, although Leo McCarey, another fine director, also gets credit for putting the boys together. They both started out very early, Stan working with Charley Chaplin's company, and ""Babe"" Hardy, as he was known working as an extra, usually in the bad guy roles very early on. The were teamed up first in ""The Lucky Dog"" in 1919, which came and went quickly. You could see in this early silent, that there was chemistry with them, with their scenes together. It would take 7 years before they were together again, and in 1927, they made their official first movie together. ""Putting Pants On Phillip"" which was Stans favorite film with Babe of all the films they made. They made some very good silent films like ""Liberty"" where they are high on a scaffolding overlooking Los Angeles. And make no mistake, they were really high up there, similar to Harold Lloyd climbing that building in ""Safety Last"". No digital effects back in those days. Of course everyone knows ""Big Business"" another great where the boys try to sell Christmas trees in the summer, although this film was made in mid late December of 1928. But the silents were fading and in early 1929, the boys filmed their first sound film ""Unaccustomed As We Are"", and they never looked back. They made a perfect transition from silents to sounds because their personalities and their voices fit perfectly for sound, unlike some other actors and actresses who couldn't fit with the conversion to sound. And from 1929 till 1954/55, the boys stayed and worked together, either in films, or live tours and shows. Their final appearance in public was in 1954, when they appeared on the TV show ""This Is Your Life"" when they were surprised by host Ralph Edwards. Stan was a little nervous and ill at ease, but Babe enjoyed it. It was a touching final appearance, and it marked the final time that boys put on their trademark bowler hats. As soon as they put them on, you saw Laurel and Hardy as we all know and loved them, it was a fitting finale. The boys were even preparing to do television, they were lined up with Hal Roach Jr. to do some TV shows, in color, but shortly before filming started, Stan suffered a stroke, and then shortly after that Babe also suffered a stroke. Stan's stoke was minor, and he recovered, but Babes stroke was more serious, he lost a lot of weight, but it didn't help. Babe died in 1957. Stan never made another film or movie again for respect to his partner. Stan lived long enough to see the fans admiration for himself and for Babe. Stan died in 1965. For years the boys films have been long neglected and handled improperly. They have been treated better in Europe, where they have also been loved and respected for years. There was a wonderful box set released in the UK several years back which contained all their silents and most of their sound films. It has fairly good prints, although the silents look a little rough. And it also has 'uuuuuuuggggggggghhhhhhhh' colorized versions of the films which look terrible. However to play the dvds in America you would need a region free player, and the set was fairly expensive, so this was a costly venture. However, the boys now get the attention to detail they deserve. This new collection contains all of their ""Hal Roach"" sounds and shorts. There were several they made for other companies, but they are not included here. They are however easily available else where.""March Of The Wooden Soldiers, Fra Diavolo, Bonnie Scotland, and The Flying Deuces"" are missing from this collection. Also none of their silent shorts are included. However you get all of the sound shorts and all of their features in chronological order, with excellent prints, many of them restored as close as possible to the original theatrical releases. This collection also contains a few of the European versions of some of their shorts and features. They feature Stan and Babe speaking phonetically in either French or Spanish. These are fun to watch, especially watching Stan and Babe speaking in their own voices. These European versions contain footage not found in their American versions. I have seen many versions of these shorts and features on other collections, I have the UK box set also, and I can positively confirm that these shorts and films in this brand new collection, look and sound the best I have seen or heard. They have been newly transferred in high definition, so there is much more clarity and sharpness than ever before. Of course they are not perfect, still scratches, and sound distortions remain, but they are kept to a minimum. They have been updated as much as possible to today's video standards, and can be enjoyed by everyone. Some have complained about the packaging. I have had no problems so far. The package is in a book format, and I find that I can remove discs without a problem. I found no scratches on the discs, when I opened my collection. Unless a complete restoration occurs for a slightly possible future blu-ray release, these are the best that Stan and the Babe Hardy will look and sound. There are some good bonuses also here. A few commentaries for some of the films, a short tribute to the boys from Dick Van Dyke, Jerry Lewis and others, a interactive tour, some shorts where the boys made guest or cameo appearances. And the book contains some good info on each short and film. So rejoice L+H fans, we finally have a proper release to enjoy. And hopefully their silents will be released properly also in the future. If you are a fan, this is definitely the upgrade you have been waiting for. A big thumbs up.",1325203200,14,6022,4.660714285714286

No, it doesn't include the earlier silent pics before 1929
(But I don't care for those anyway).

No, it doesn't include the later movies after 1940
(But there were only a couple that were good after that time and they're cheaply obtainable).

No, the special features aren't at all outstanding
(But I'd rather just see The Boys in action anyway).

No, it doesn't have subtitles
(But thankfully, my hearing is good however, subtitles would've been a plus).

No, the dvd housing is certainly not ideal, is probably too tight and could've been put together better
(But if you simply stretch the sides of the holder while removing your dvd, there should be no problem and no scratches. I have seen all of the disks several times already and they play perfectly).

Yes, the picture/sound quality was obviously improved upon.

Yes, all of the short talkie films are included from the superior Roach Studios.

Yes, some of the short films that were physically reworked and reshot in different languages are included and are hilarious.

So overall, I am very satisfied with this set that should make any big L&H fan very fulfilled. There is currently no better disk collection of L&H in the States and I am very glad this one exists and belongs to me. I highly recommend this item!",1325030400,14,1350,4.7844827586206895

4650891,4,B005BYBZKY,"After years of purchasing prints and videos (does anyone remember Blackhawk Films and Nostalgia Merchant?), here are the vast majority of films that Laurel and Hardy made for Hal Roach Studios between 1929 and 1940, altogether in one box.  It starts with ""Unaccustomed As We Are,""  their first sound short, in which Ollie brings Stan home for dinner, and his wife (Mae Busch) walks out on him.  When Mrs. Kennedy (Thelma Todd) offers to help, her dress catches fire, and she's forced to hide from husband Edgar in a trunk.  It's an idea worked out more completely in the feature ""Blockheads"" (1938).  Unlike many actors, it appears that Stan and Ollie had little difficulty making the transition to sound.  Most fans have seen the shorts and features many times, so I needn't describe them, but I am looking forward to seeing the French and Spanish versions of a few shorts, which I understand are not exactly like the English ones.  And I was delighted to see trailers for Pack Up Your Troubles, Saps At Sea, and A Chump At Oxford, which I'm sure are pretty rare items.  I must say a word, however, about ""Swiss Miss"" (1938).  The only thing wrong with it is there is too much Walter Woolf King and Della Lind (a little of them goes a long way) and not enough Laurel and Hardy.  But the scene where Stan tries to get the Saint Bernard to give him some whiskey, while contrived, is brilliantly done.  Then of course, there is the pair's love/hate relationship with pianos (see ""The Music Box"").  While trying to move a piano across a bridge, Stan and Ollie meet a gorilla, which naturally are abundant in Switzerland!  According to some sources I have read, Stan wanted the jealous cook to plant a bomb inside the piano, set to go off when a certain note is struck.  As Ollie and Stan race around the piano avoiding the gorilla, they strike notes at random, which don't mean anything.  However, if one of those notes were attached to a bomb...  Stan's contract allowed him to demand that the studio spare no expense on this production, but perhaps Roach felt that this would just cost too much and rejected the idea.  Please note that ""Fra Diavolo,"" (The Devil's Brother) (1932) and ""Bonnie Scotland"" (1935) are missing from this set, but are available elsewhere.",1324857600,7,2263,4.659949622166247

As an avid admirer of "" the Boys"" a lot of what I may say should be considered prejudicial. However, as to this particular set of DVDs, I can honestly say the quality is very good especially when one considers that some of the original films are more than 80 years old. I have collected Laurel & Hardy movies whenever I could find them and have most of their work on VHS tapes and whatever I could find in DVD format. Prior to this set most of the quality has been from bad to so so. A few years ago I became aware of an excellent set of DVDs but they were only in European format. I considered buying a special player and buying that set but came to my senses and gave up that idea. When I saw this set available on Amazon and read the reviews, I was sold. If you like Laurel & Hardy you must have this set. I understand that many of the copies were taken from original prints and that all of them have the benefit of current technology which has rendered excellent results.
My final word is, buy this set. You will not be sorry.",1324684800,10,1225,4.805687203791469

4650894,5,B005BYBZKY,"I think the packaging is great.  If you are familiar with the 'Blu-Ray Book' format, then this is exactly that.  And it is the first time I have seen this format housing DVD's rather than the BluRay Discs.  This 10-Disc set opens up like any other book and, indeed, the set looks like a book.  Each of the DVD's are housed in their own cardboard sleeve and within that sleeve is a paper envelope which the DVD itself resides perfectly safe and scratch-free. The cardboard sleeves open up like pages in a book. I think this book format makes this a very collectible set.  You can leave the Book Set in the cardboard sleeve that you see on Amazons page or remove it and leave it on your shelf like that.  Your DVD's are better protected in this kind of set-up, I believe, than in some or most of the DVD cases on the market today.  This Book Format is strong, protective, has a sturdy feel to it and is very attractive.  They did a good job on this and is well worth the money.

Briefly, the picture quality is excellent and I haven't seen it better anywhere else.  I have had some of these same remastered movies for approximately 4 years from a set I obtained in Germany but this set has those and so much more and is a great value.",1324425600,12,1232,4.24892703862661
4650895,5,B005BYBZKY,"Aside from the no-brainer five star rating, I don't really have much to add to what has already been stated regarding the set's contents. My only issue is that I have seldom (if ever) heard so much carping about packaging as I have for this set! Yes, there were two discs in mine that required a bit of wiping. Apart from that, they play just fine, thank you! I actually rather like the packaging, as it doesn't take up a lot of space, and is environmentally friendly compared to other, ridiculously bulky packaging designs. As far as I am concerned, the real bane as far as DVDs and/or packaging go are the dreaded double-sided discs. Whoever thought that this relic from the golden age of vinyl belonged in the digital age ought to have their head examined! Dual layer makes that totally unnecessary! As far as conventional packaging is concerned, I have occasionally had DVDs arrive in the mail, only to find the disc shaking inside the case because the centerpiece holding the disc in place busted. At least with the packaging for the Laurel & Hardy set, that is definitely not a concern!

I regret taking up so much space discussing the packaging rather than the contents. It's just that there have been far more negative comments about it than it actually deserves, in my opinion!

I am very thankful that amazon.com has restocked Laurel & Hardy: The Essential Collection (though I ordered mine through amazon.ca). It had allegedly been pulled due to ""too many returns."" It seemed to me that based on comments by the loudest critics of the packaging that some returned their sets without even playing any of the discs! For Region 1 based Laurel & Hardy fans who have been waiting so long for a marvelous set like this, that don't want it to disappear, I implore you to at least try playing the discs first (at the very least, fast forward through all the titles!) before deciding whether a return shipment is warranted!

4650896,5,B005BYBZKY,"My sister got this for me for Christmas, and I love her for it. I've always been a big L&H fan, and this set is pretty close to perfect.

If you don't own this, you need to run out and get it. It is easily the best DVD release of a classic comedy team's work to date. It includes all of the L&H sound films in the Hal Roach library* - shorts, features, and surviving alternate-language versions, from the days before dubbing technology was perfected, resulting in Laurel and Hardy having to learn to speak Spanish, French, etc. phonetically through 1931).

""Another Fine Mess"", ""Tit for Tat"", ""Helpmates"", ""Sons of the Desert"", and ""Way Out West"", all in one box set? I couldn't believe it!

THe restorations all look and sound great. The packaging is well designed (the issue with the DVDs being in the page-sleeves doesn't bother me much - I just make sure I have clean hands and pull the disc out slowly). The only criticism I really have is that the four films with audio commentary (Hog Wild, Another Fine Mess, Way Out West, and Sons of the Desert) are not labeled in the packaging. But the first three of these four have _two_ audio commentaries, so I forgive RHI/Viviendi for that little slip-up.

*The L&H features not owned by RHI Entertainment - ""The Devil's Brother"", ""Bonnie Scotland"", ""Babes in Toyland"", ""The Flying Duesces"" the lesser films they made at Fox & MGM, and the infamous ""Atoll K"", do not appear here, but they are available elsewhere from their respective copyright holders (or, in the cases of the public domain ""Babes"", ""Deuces"", and ""Atoll K"", whoever wants to put them out).",1324252800,4,1606,4.644366197183099
4650897,3,B005BYBZKY,"No one makes us laugh more than Laurel and Hardy.
  Oh wait!
  There's Lucy and Ethel.
  But Stan and Ollie come in awfully close.
  We just got our greedy little hands on Laurel & Hardy: The Essential Collection, a 10-disc box set that's empty in a fuzzy kind of way.
  The set contains 58 shorts and features, produced by Hal Roach from 1929 through 1940. These are supposedly the best prints out there---RHI Entertainment and Vivendi Entertainment claim that the films have been ""transferred in high definition for the first time and digitally enhanced for home viewing in the finest quality available to date""---but we question that claim. Though it's reported that the ""high-definition transfers"" come from 35mm film transfers using materials borrowed Munich, they are still far from perfect. We have VHS copies of many of these shorts and films in cleaner, more pristine condition.
  What's interesting here, of course, is what's missing. The 20th-Century Fox features, as flaccid as they are, are not here. Neither is Babes in Toyland or any of the great silents. (Rumor has it that money speaks, and that RHI and Vivendi will release those in a second box set in 2012.) Where are the marvelous This is Your Life segments? And what about Pick a Star, Roach's short in which L&H make quite an extended appearance?
  We are not block heads. There are goodies. Laurel and Hardy filmed foreign versions of some of their shorts, reshooting scenes and phonetically learning the dialogue. (This is exactly how Connie Francis sang all those songs in Spanish and Italian and Hebrew and Japanese.) These foreign flicks are fun to watch, even if the extended scenes are mere filler.
  There are other treats, including the three-reel foreign version of Laughing Gravy (1931); an uncut 70-minute version of  Pardon Us (1931) and two takes on A Chum  at Oxford (1940)---a 63-minute feature version and a 42-minute streamlined version.
  More goodies abound with a selection of L&H's cameo appearances, including On the Loose (1931), starring Thelma Todd and ZaSu Pitts; the Our Gang short Wild Poses (1933); On the Wrong Trek (1936), starring Charley Chase and the 1942 public-domain short The Tree in a Test Tube, vital because it's the only surviving appearance of Laurel and Hardy in color.
  Alas, the two hours of ""special features"" include benign interviews with Dick Van Dyke, Tim Conway, Penn and Teller and Chuck McCann praising their idols, and a near-manic Jerry Lewis, who makes a huge ass of himself by telling stories about Ollie and Stan that are 100% inaccurate. What drugs was he on?
  Laurel & Hardy: The Essential Collection is packaged in a ""book,"" the pages of which served as holders. Not a great idea. What is a great idea is having the works presented chronologically, starting with L&H's first talkie, Unaccustomed as We Are (1929) and ending with Saps at Sea (1940).
  There are some commentaries by Laurel and Hardy aficionados, along with a virtual map that allows viewers to take an interactive tour of the iconic Southern California locations where Laurel and Hardy filmed. This feature could have, should have, been much, much more.
  Essential? Yes.
  Definitive? Hardly.

The quality of the movies is remarkable, considering their age.  Not only is the entertainment enjoyable, but their movies give us an insight into what the styles were then in dress, autos, buildings on the streets, houses, and home decor, in other words, a glimpse into history.  Los Angeles was not as crowded then.

I've waited a long time to be able to own and watch many of these films, and now I do - to enjoy by myself, with family, and to introduce to my granddaughter as soon as she is old enough.  Their talent should live on - genius comedy.

I met Stan Laurel in 1963 in two separate meetings and he was as nice as I had hoped - a gentleman and very friendly, smiling all the time.  These films keep my memories of those meetings alive. Wish I could have met Oliver.

I'm reviewing this set in December after receiving it in October for no better reason than that's how long it took me to watch the entire contents of this set, including commentaries.  In light of some of the one-star reviews that were posted so close to the day of release, complaining about defective discs due to the cardboard packaging, I would like to state that each of the ten discs contained in this set played flawlessly.  I know, because I have now played all ten of them.

I guess I have to wonder about these reviews from people who immediately claimed to have received damaged and defective discs when they barely had time to stick said discs into a DVD player, let alone watch the discs.  Why do I have a sneaking suspicion that those individuals were taking advantage of Amazon's rather liberal return policy?

Now, they are not and the price is more than double! I've heard rumors that too many people got defective copies that they ordered from Amazon. If this is so, shame on you, people at Vivendi for not exercising more ""quality control"" over your product before it gets out. I have a wife and child and am barely making enough to pay the bills. I REALLY wanted to get this Laurel and Hardy DVD set, and added even more to my credit card debt to buy it. So far, the discs I've played seem fine - but I haven't run them all on my disc player. If any of them are defective, you can be sure I'll send them back! In times like what we are living through now, your reputation should mean more than anything! Why shoot yourselves in the foot? You've got a product - despite the packaging - that a LOT of old movie fans want and you can do well with it. Why not make sure your product is good first?

Also, let me add a few things to clarify a reviewer;s question about Laurel and Hardy films NOT in this colection:

A gentleman by the name of Chris Belena wants to know why THE DEVIL'S BROTHER (a.k.a FRA DIAVALO), BABES IN TOYLAND (a.k.a. MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS) and THE FLYING DEUCES aren't in this particular collection. I'll add BONNIE SCOTLAND to it, 'cause I thnk Mr. Belena forgot to do so. I thnk I can answer his questions.

Whoever it is that now holds the license to the Hal Roach LAUREL AND HARDY sound movie library DOES NOT OWN THE RIGHTS to THE DEVIL'S BROTHER, BONNIE SCOTLAND, BABES IN TOYLAND and THE FLYING DEUCES. Hal Roach apparently needed cash to keep his studio running, and apparently sold MGM the rights to THE DEVIL'S BROTHER and BONNIE SCOTLAND around 1941. Both films have been restored by Ted Turner's company and are still out on DVD in a nice TCM set.

Laurel and Hardy historian Richard Bann stated some years ago that Hal Roach was given something like a ten-year lease to the rights to BABES IN TOYLAND by the Victor Herbert Estate, meaning that sometime in the 1940s, Roach no longer owned the rights to BABES IN TOYLAND and it went to various distributors over the years, now ironically back with MGM and restored.

THE FLYING DEUCES was produced for Boris Morros and released by RKO Radio Pictures in 1939. After a time, the rights went back to Mr. Morros and he let Astor Pictures re-release it later in theaters. It is now in the ""Public Domain, "" and a good version is out from Kino Video (but not from the original RKO negatives or prints) and on this version, you'll find a good, complete version of THE STOLEN JOOLS as an ""extra.""

Richard Feiner and Co. - which used to have rights to all of the Hal Roach-Laurel and Hardy films - still retains ownership of their silent comedies, and I have heard that UCLA is restoring them too, so sometime in the future, we may get the silent LAUREL AND HARDY shorts on DVD (or whatever format is around then). You still might be able to find the ten volume set of THE LOST FILMS OF LAUREL AND HARDY where film historian Micheel Agee did his best to restore these silent shorts as well. Some of them may still be in print from Image Entertainment.

I hope this helps! All things considered, this is a pretty darn good set. I could live without the cardboard sleeve cases for the DVDs - which others have been saying. It's a nice idea, but not practical for fans that want to see the films over again. Overall, it's terrrific and after all this time, well worth getting!",1323302400,10,3584,4.372372372372372

4650919,4,B005BYBZKY,"I felt that it was not necessary to rewrite many of the reviews for this set as it would just be overkill. This review (and the reason for the 4-out-of-5 stars) is based on some missing content and missing information from the professional reviews.

This set is considered ""Essential"" and not ""Complete"" for the time period for which it covers. My gripe is this: the foreign-language versions should have been left off of this set and sold separately for those who really care about them. Instead, three missing films, from the period covered, should have been included: The Flying Deuces, Babes in Toyland (AKA The March of the Wooden Soldiers), and The Devil's Brother. Even though this set is considered ""Essential"" and not ""Complete,"" it would have been had the three above-mentioned films been included. I have not yet found a reason why they were left off - possibly, they are owned by someone else(although ""Deuces"" is in the public domain and can be downloaded for free).

Another missing film, which should have been included on the last disc (Guest Appearances) is ""The Stolen Jools"" in which L&H make a cameo along with some of the major studios' A-list actors and actresses (including Fay Wray and Babara Stanwyck). This too is available for free download in the public domain but could have benefitted from the restoration.

4650924,5,B005BYBZKY,"I won't repeat all of the detail so generously provided here by others, but instead simply lavish praise on this wonderful set of DVDs. The set is nicely packaged and the liner notes were clearly written by people who really care about The Boys' legacy. A rare thing, these days, when even classic films are often slapped into boxes with little thought about why someone might be interested in owning them. We get something about each and every film, including cast, locations and trivia. In the films, we get alternate endings, alternate soundtracks, and of course the lengthened foreign-language versions of several shorts. The latter in particular were a real revelation to this life-long L&H fan. (Oliver's French pronunciation was much better than Stan's! Who knew?)

Be advised, even with the care that has been taken here, some of the films are still in a poor state, and we have to trust (unless we have reason to know better) that the best available prints were used in this digital transfer. Some day we might get real frame-by-frame restorations of these miniature comic masterpieces. But for now we have something more complete than most of us have ever seen before. I considered putting this set on my gift list in the hopes that someone in my family would give it to me for the holidays. I decided not to leave anything to chance, and bought it for myself.

There're great commentaries on several of the shorts and features. Even the little pictures on the top and bottom of the pages in the book make me laugh, and certainly entice you to put a disc in to play! There are enough movies and shorts here to keep you laughing for months, if not years.

My personal favorites that are all on this collection: Hog Wild (commentary mentioned other titles that were considered, like Hay Wire, that make more sense since it's mostly about Stan and Ollie putting up an antenna); The Music Box, which won an Academy Award in 1932 for Best Short Subject and was the first ever to be so honored. The hilarious and brilliant duo - Lenny Bruce once said L&H were brilliant comics, but Abbott and Costello were comedic actors - are here lugging a crated player-piano up the ridiculously long flights of stairs outside; County Hospital is hilarious too, and Brats, which I had never seen, is funny and fascinatingly surreal for all its excellent props. I'm not a huge fan of slapstick or ""physical comedy"", but you can't beat the clean, smart & slightly stylized approach L&H had. One has to slow down a little, their timing was not like ours, but I actually prefer their timing. The beginning of Another Fine Mess features the boys running very fast from a long distance down the sidewalk, right up to the camera. Can't help thinking the beginning of Hard Day's Night that copies this is an homage to L&H.

The original prints have been remastered from the Roach Studios' vault, which includes foreign & extended versions of their work.
I won't even go into an assessment of their work; to do so would be like writing a book on the boys' comic genius. The best thing to do is read the comments on each work included in the book.

4650932,5,B005BYBZKY,"l and h's film career can be broken down into three phrases. the first and best was the silent era. it is hard to find four greater comedies than habeus corpus, big business, from soup to nuts and two tars. hopefully all their silents will be released here soon.

the third and last were the fox films, the absolute pits! the boys were too old, oliver was too fat, their routines were stale, they just weren't happy at fox and they looked worn out. worst of all, much of the films were given over  to other characters.

the middle phase is here and is almost complete...and is fantastic! and, at amazon's price, is the perfect gift for yourself or anyone you know. if you hate someone and have to give a gift, give them any of the fox boxes. they'll definitely despise you for it.

there are dozens of films in the box, both shorts and features, some quite hard to find. and even the common ones are beautifully presented. best of all are the many early sound spanish versions which are very rare. not all of the films are classics  but all are fun. and they are l and h.

ten fully packed l and h discs at this low price is an absolute must. buy, see at your leisure and get that warm and wonderful feeling, a feeling almost impossible to find today.",1321833600,6,1251,4.302127659574468
4650933,5,B005BYBZKY,"For many years Laurel and Hardy fans in the U.S. have been frustrated by the lack of Laurel and Hardy sound shorts available on home video. I've been a fan of the beloved team since I was a kid in the 1960s, when their films were frequently shown on television. It's been disheartening to see them being slowly forgotten and discarded by newer generations. But for those who still appreciate the genius of Stan and Ollie, this set is a dream come true. It contains their entire sound era Hal Roach catalog - shorts and full-length features - with the exception of a few features that apparently belong to MGM (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Brother-Bonnie-Scotland/dp/B000E1MXTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Brother, Bonnie Scotland)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/March-of-the-Wooden-Soldiers/dp/B001BSBBI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">March of the Wooden Soldiers</a>) which have already been released on DVD. Besides the wonderful films that fans of the team are familiar with, also included are seven foreign language versions of Laurel and Hardy shorts completely remade for other markets with Laurel and Hardy speaking in Spanish or French, learning their lines phonetically. These are not only of historic interest, but also very entertaining. It is fascinating to watch L&H in performances that have been virtually unseen for over 60 years.

The image quality of most of the films is stunning, the result of using the original film elements, when available, and some loving restoration work which included reinstating all the original opening title cards. Even the packaging for this 10 disc set is a thing of beauty, both in appearance and functionality. Using a book-like format with cardboard sleeves and color-coded discs makes it super-easy to find any film you are looking for and place it back in the correct spot later.

The extras include interviews with comedians like Dick Van Dyke and Jerry Lewis paying tribute to the boys, a feature showing the various locations used in L&H films as they appear today, four bonus shorts featuring guest appearances by Laurel and Hardy and the trailers from some of their features.

As a longtime fan of the team, I couldn't be happier with LAUREL & HARDY: THE ESSENTIAL COLLECTION. It truly is an essential part of my DVD collection.",1321747200,21,2405,5.638121546961326
4650934,5,B005BYBZKY,"The previous Laurel & Hardy gold standard was the Blackhawk Films collection, which offered this same group of sound titles as well as the majority of extant silent titles--on film. There have sporadic attempts to offer the films on video tape and disc formats. The ""Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy"" is currently the definitive compilation of the silent shorts (with a few early sound subjects thrown in). ""Laurel & Hardy: The Collection,"" released in Britain, was notable for gathering practically everything that had been in the Blackhawk library, along with some of the foreign market variants and guest appearance shorts (and the original release print of ""Brats""). Unfortunately, the British release had to make do with much of the older source material, including Film Classics reissue prints and badly deteriorated prints for the silents. The ""Essential Collection"" represents a major improvement in the presentation of the bulk of the Laurel & Hardy canon.

It's a shame the silents couldn't be presented here, but the ""Lost Films"" dvds are still fairly easy to locate, and are the best way of studying and enjoying the team's formative years. The two items in the British package that will be missed most will be the original release of ""Brats"" and excerpts from the German variant of ""Pardon Us."" The treatment of ""Brats"" is possibly the only sore point in the ""Essential Collection,"" which uses the reissue print and provides an either/or soundtrack option. If this sort of economy was necessary, I wish they had layered the dual soundtracks on the original release, which has the original gag titles and seems, to me, to have superior pictorial quality.

Otherwise, this new collection beats all previous anthologies hands down. All the original Hal Roach Studios title cards are back in place, and the visual element has been collected and restored from superior quality prints. The ""bleached"" aspect of certain titles like ""Sons of the Desert"" and ""Them Thar Hills"" has been replaced by robust black and white tones that make watching these classics a new experience. The once lost track to ""Unaccustomed as We Are"" has been re-recorded for improved audibility. If you haven't seen any of the foreign release variants, start with the Spanish version of ""Below Zero"": ""Tiembla Y Titubea,"" and see how a comedy with somber undertones is almost transformed into a work of Expressionism in the extended cafe scene. Another revelation is the ""streamliner"" (42 min.) version of ""Chump at Oxford,"" previously available only on film from Blackhawk. The shorter version is composed of different shots and takes, and is actually better proportioned than the longer version, where the ""Lord Paddington"" sequence almost comes across as an extended gag rather than a turning point in the plot.

There are some wonderful bonus vocal tracks on a handful of the films providing insights from Rich Correll, Randy Skretvedt, and Hal Roach authority Richard W. Bann, as well as an easy-going bantering session between Tim Conway and Chuck McCann during ""Sons of the Desert."" The supplemental material on Disc 10 includes a retrospective of filming locations with an interactive map, and a documentary tribute featuring Dick Van Dyke, Penn & Teller, and Jerry Lewis, among others. The recollections from Van Dyke and Lewis are particularly poignant, since both men knew Stan Laurel in his later years, but greater editorial care might have been used in portions of the Lewis interview; his ""recounting"" of Laurel meeting Hardy is bizarre fiction, particularly in light of the fact that Laurel had met Hardy years earlier when both appeared in the silent comedy ""Lucky Dog.""

This set includes none of the colorizations that cluttered the British set. This is a blessing since those ""enhanced versions"" were not only freakishly bad (recalling the colorized versions released by Cabin Fever in the '90s), but also had trims and fade-outs for tv commercials. If you must see Laurel & Hardy in color, check out Legend's colorized&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/March-of-the-Wooden-Soldiers-Colorized-Black-White/dp/B001BSBBI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">March of the Wooden Soldiers (Colorized / Black & White)</a>, which like all the Legend colorizations I've seen, has been done with the sensibilities of costume/set/and pictorial composition. Or, just watch the short Kodachrome film ""Tree in a Test Tube"" on disc 10.

4650935,5,B005BYBZKY,"I have watched about half the films on this DVD set and all I have to say is ""WOW!""  For years, I have been waiting for a collection like this to be released.  The picture and sound quality is great.  This is among my prized possessions when it comes to DVDs.",1321315200,18,259,4.03921568627451
4650936,5,B005BYBZKY,"I've been viewing the new Laurel & Hardy discs at length, and comparing them to the laserdiscs and the UK set with an analytical eye. My verdict is a resounding ""thumbs up"" in all departments. The only real drawback is the already-mentioned absence of the silent classics. (These may well be on their way, in a future companion set.) I'm not exactly impartial in these matters. I guess I've derived more pleasure from Laurel & Hardy than from any other movie personalities in history. Their charm never seems to fade - for me, anyway.

The films themselves - all from the Hal Roach Library and long cherished by at least three generations of fans - surely need no further validation. Owning them in uncut, restored editions has been a lifelong dream for devotees all over the world. Some of the early shorts, particularly NIGHT OWLS, BRATS and ONE GOOD TURN, are only marginally improved. (Apparently the original elements are in pretty bad shape. As with the Chaplin Keystones and Essanays, the producers did the best restoration possible with the prints available.) But most are pristine, comparatively; it's like watching them for the first time.

In addition to ALL the talkie shorts and most of the features (more about that later), you also get some rare foreign language versions. These fascinating oddities often feature gags and business not seen in the more familiar domestic releases, and I STRONGLY encourage fans not to skip them. Who knew, for instance, that POLITIQUERIAS (CHICKENS COME HOME) included priceless footage of Hardy ballroom dancing, and singing in Spanish - as well as an extended magic act with a Spanish-speaking James Finlayson? Even better, statuesque Anita Garvin is even more smoking hot when she's speaking French (in LES CAROTTIERS)! More rarities: both LAUGHING GRAVY and PARDON US include ""lost"" outtake footage, deleted from the theatrical release and unseen for decades. (The former features a bonus alternate ending, and the latter adds a lengthy sequence where Stan and Ollie rescue June ""Miss Crabtree"" Marlowe from a burning building.) Wisely, the set does not waste valuable space by including ""colorized"" versions.

Due to vagaries of copyright ownership, some features in the canon are missing from the set: FRA DIAVOLO, BONNIE SCOTLAND, BABES IN TOYLAND, The FLYING DEUCES (not a Roach production) and HOLLYWOOD PARTY. However, ALL of these are readily available on DVD from other sources. There's a 10th disc with miscellaneous items, including the team's cameo appearances with Charley Chase, Our Gang and Thelma Todd/ZaSu Pitts - but it doesn't include The STOLEN JOOLS. An ""extras"" feature takes the viewer on a tour of L&H shooting locations around modern Los Angeles, including the iconic MUSIC BOX steps in Silver Lake. (All true L&H buffs have made at least one pilgrimage there!)

This last disc also features appreciative commentaries by Dick Van Dyke, Penn & Teller (the latter is characteristically silent), Tim Conway, Chuck McCann, Super Dave Osborne and - perhaps unfortunately - Jerry Lewis. One major quibble with the Lewis interview is his bizarre ""when Laurel met Hardy"" story which, as many fans have pointed out, is pure drivel. No one can dispute Lewis' megawatt talent, but he seems to have gone a bit dotty lately. Lewis loves Laurel but basically dismisses Hardy, claiming he was a ""construction worker"" on the lot when Stan saw him one day and asked Roach if he could ""use"" him. Of course, this is complete rubbish. Oliver Hardy had a long and versatile career in silent films prior to the teaming, appearing in literally hundreds of comedies - as heavies and/or comic foils, in ""character"" parts, etc. His film roles stretch back to 1914, even preceding Laurel's 1917 screen debut. (Hardy had even been teamed before - in a series of ""Plump and Runt"" comedies with Billy Ruge.) These films are not only documented, but many still survive. It may be news to Jerry Lewis, but Hardy was already an established comedy veteran by the time he arrived at Roach, as any film historian could easily attest.

In Jerry's defense, he MAY have been thinking of Charlie Hall - who actually DID do carpentry work on the Roach lot between supporting roles, to supplement his income. I'm guessing - I don't know this - but it's entirely possible that Stan ""discovered"" Hall, sensing some comic potential in his diminutive but feisty persona. (The L&H creative team, which once featured Leo McCarey and George Stevens, was always looking for fresh new foils, since Finlayson and Edgar Kennedy were in such high demand elsewhere on the lot.) Perhaps Laurel relayed the anecdote about Hall, and Jerry Lewis simply got confused. Like I said, I don't really know for sure. Charlie Hall is SO good that it's hard to believe he was just a day laborer who inadvertently happened to be effective onscreen.

L&H fans are understandably upset by Lewis' belittling implication that Oliver Hardy was some amateur that Stan trained, like a monkey. Make no mistake; Hardy is brilliant. No less an authority than John Cleese considers Hardy one of the best, if not THE best American screen comic, as does Ricky Gervais. Stan Laurel himself revered Hardy, listing him second only to Chaplin. Laurel was indisputably the creative genius behind the scenes, but Hardy was (arguably) a shade the more nuanced performer. (That's open to debate, of course. I agree with William K. Everson, who believed it was ultimately pointless to compare the two.) Jerry Lewis considers himself Stan's protege, and is fiercely loyal to him. That's entirely understandable, even commendable - but it doesn't give him the right to rewrite history.",1321228800,138,5668,5.024468085106383

Love the book feel and the way the discs are stored.  Like the fact the films are presented in chronological order not ""themed"" like the UK set. And you don't need a region free player!! Can't wait to fire up the projector and have my own L&H fest!",1320969600,6,412,4.493333333333333
4650939,5,B005BYBZKY,"I am from the UK, over the years I have purchased the UK 21 disc collection and even went and bought the superior German Kinowelt set.

Now I have splashed out once again and bought this set. I have to say, this blows the other two out of the water, unlike the UK set, all missing footage is retained. Unlike the German set this collection does not have sound sync problems. And finally and most importantly, the sound and image quality is as clear and as close to perfect as I have ever seen and I have been a die hard fan of Laurel & Hardy since I was 2, I am now 25.

If you are a fan of Laurel & Hardy or are new to Laurel & Hardy, then buy this set, it really is the essential collection and will be the best available release of their Hal Roach talkie era for a fair few years yet, especially if we wait for the UCLA to get their restorations finished.

If a re-release of Laurel & Hardy's silent films can be released with the same love and care that has been put into this set I will be the happiest fan around. I don't need to speak about the films, they speak for themselves. With regard to the packaging it is great, lovely liner notes and the discs slip in and out nicely. A MUST HAVE PURCHASE!",1320796800,34,1206,4.0588235294117645
4650940,4,B005BYBZKY,"This DVD set has several flaws, but it is still enjoyable to watch. This may be the most comprehensive collection of works from Laurel and Hardy. However, it is not full. There are some films that are not included for some reason, some from Hal Roach, and some not. For example, MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS (aka BABES IN TOYLAND), was not included and yet was from MGM and Hal Roach. Even though some of these films are not in this set, they are available separately including BONNIE SCOTLAND and THE DEVIL'S BROTHER. Another drawback to this set is that there are no subtitles or closed captions for the films. There are English subtitles for the Spanish and French versions of a few of their films, but nothing else. Despite these drawbacks, (I might even call them disappointments), the set is reasonably well assembled and still very enjoyable. Every film has a description and a little bit of trivia about each. There are many films I have not seen in ages and some I have never seen in my life. If you are a big fan of Laurel and Hardy, this would be a good set to have in your collection; however, it might be more worth it if it were under $60.",1320624000,6,1153,4.417840375586854

The only negative is the lack of subtitles for the English-language videos.  When TMC had its L&H marathon a year or so ago, every video was closed captioned so CC already exists for these videos and should have been included in this otherwise excellent collection.",1320537600,6,431,4.512820512820513
4650942,5,B005BYBZKY,"I have received this wonderful collection a week ago and already watched a good part of it.
The content is absolutely fabulous. A couple of extra small purchases will make your L&H collection complete.
As many have already said, the quality of the videos (and sound) is great. Format is also OK and nothing is cut from the screen.
I like the packaging as well, and disagree with the many reviewers who give packaging a low rate. The book format with rigid cardboard sleeves is compact and sturdy. This goes into (or comes out from) another box (the one you see in the photo). This double packaging provides sufficient protection for the discs.
Taking out the DVDs is not hard at all and with a little care one can avoid touching the data surface (if not for a tiny corner). If you're extremely worried about this, just make sure to have clean hands before taking a disc out. That's it!
I also appreciate very much the small written synopses for each film.
Finally, $62 for a 10 disc collection is not a bad price at all.
In conclusion, this is a great collection which will make all L&H fans (and newbies) very happy.",1320451200,12,1117,4.5073891625615765

Throw in some bonuses like celebrity tributes, a film site locations tour, L&H cameos in other Roach films, and audio commentaries by top L&H historians... and you have the top DVD box set of 2011.

4650944,5,B005BYBZKY,"The Hal Roach LAUREL & HARDY shorts are inarguably the greatest of all the film medium's short subjects released in sound. A vast improvement over the 21-Disc jigsaw puzzle released in the UK years ago, this is what you've been dreaming of. Almost all of the surviving sound shorts and features the boys did for Roach in chronological order. Even if they did no restoration work to them, it'd still be worth the ridiculously low price. 10 discs of restored prime material at $64.99? That's a joke I don't mind playing along with!

I'm utterly bamboozled by the fact that this set is only averaging four stars on Amazon. Perhaps others aren't as blindsided by the fact that this thing actually exists as I am. Most of the complaints are directed toward the packaging - not very bothered by this personally. I think it's quite handsome, and I've learned that no case is impervious to the dreaded scratch. Flaws in the restoration? Well, it's hard to fault RHI for the things not looking perfect, given the neglect they've received over the years, but even under those circumstances, most of them look amazing. The first short I watched was ""Going Bye-Bye"", and it was like seeing it for the first time all over again. They have also dug up elements, such as the original soundtracks to ""Perfect Day"" and ""Brats"", which have never been available before. The only thing that's unsettling, really, is properly seeing all those MGM lions and copyrights in the titles!

I'm still in a daze almost two weeks after receiving it. This has been the most vitally needed set of American films that had remained unreleased for years (just barely surpassing the Tex Avery MGM cartoon echelon), and they did it right the first time. That happens - never. Buy this before the powers that be come to their senses, put it out of print, and it becomes another ""geez, wish I got it when it came out"" release.",1320278400,12,1887,4.680722891566265
4650945,5,B005BYBZKY,"Ok let's get down o the nitty gritty.. :) The films are 5 star releases and there is no doubt about it.. some of the greatest and funniest movies ever to come out of hollywood's golden age. Having been an L&H fan since I was a kid I can honestly say that I've seen and had their work in many different guises over the years.. Home cinema (16mm and 8mm), video, laserdisc and most recently dvd.. I remember buying the uk 21 dvd set almost 10 years ago and collecting the Lost Films series to have superior copies of the silents.. then after much deliberating I took the plunge and bought this set also..
Firstly I have to say that I have no problems with the discs.. no scratching, no glue.. had a bit of trouble with the packaging as it was in a jiffy bag and 2 corners of the box were banged about reaching here but I can live with that!! :)
Onto the transfers themselves.. I'm happy for major improvements in Way Out West and Swiss Miss that are far superior to the same movies in the uk box set.. I was also thrilled to see (finally!!) the original titles for Me and My Pal, Come Clean, The Chimp, One Good Turn and Hog Wild that were absent from the uk set.. All the films are presented in their original aspect ratio (4:3) but strangely Hog Wild looks squashed in comparison to other versions I have seen and own.. still no problems there.. The MGM fanfares with Leo the Lion are great but I wonder how many of these just weren't tacked on to the existing films.. The NRA logo is strangely missing from Them Thar Hills when I can guarantee you it exists on the original copy..
These are only minor gripes.. To make the collection truely complete I wish they would have included the ORIGINAL release version of Pardon Us at 56 minutes instead of the one we have here and also the full original titles of BRATS which exists in the english and german releases..
That aside pick this up and enjoy superior (for the most part) prints of the greatest comedy team of all time.. Can't reccomend it enough.. :D<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laurel-Hardy-The-Essential-Collection/dp/B005BYBZKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laurel & Hardy:  The Essential Collection</a>",1320278400,7,2200,4.714285714285714
4650946,5,B005BYBZKY,It's so good to finally see all these again after waiting so long. However the packaging is a major problem. All my discs were scratched. They need to redesign the packaging after arresting the knuckle head who came up with this horrendous package.,1320192000,5,248,4.790697674418604
4650947,5,B005BYBZKY,"Let's get this out of the way first--these are not (for the most part) going to look as pristine as the L&H material released by Warner Bros or Fox.  The reason being that Hal Roach did not take good care of his film library, which subsequently changed hands multiple times, most recently to Hallmark which most famously attempted to destroy the film library in order to save money on storage costs.  The result is that many of these have been horribly abused over generations.  They only look as good as they are through preservation efforts from various institutions and enthusiasts of recent years.

And after viewing the whole set, I can safely say that these look better than they have ever looked on home video.  Most L&H collectors already purchased a L&H collection of the same titles from Europe, which also included their silent shorts (the silents are separately licensed in the North America, so no point complaining about their absence in this set).  Comparing the shorts from that collection, the vast majority of shorts and features look superior in this new collection.  Obviously, with the lack of existing original nitrate negatives for many of these, the picture quality is not going to look as flawless as Casablanca or Citizen Kane.  But the majority look pretty darn good given the circumstances.

The worst looking one is easily ""One Good Turn,"" which has a scratchy, dupey print.  Yet this is the best surviving element of that film, since it has never looked great on home video.  The best looking films in the set are the feature films of the mid 30s to 1940.  ""Swiss Miss"" and ""Way Out West"" in particular look outstanding compared to what was released overseas.  The few that don't stand out are still quite enjoyable.

Sound is quite clear on these shorts, though some of the earliest shorts show their age.  There are also different audio options for a select few shorts that were later reissued by MGM with new ""wall-to-wall"" background music.  The original music is usually preferable, but its nice to get the option.  There are also brand new, insightful commentaries on ""A Perfect Day"", ""Another Fine Mess"", ""Sons of the Desert"", and ""Way Out West.""
The best news about this set is that there HAS been some restoration to these films, at least in terms of original title cards and missing footage from previous collections.  Not a single Films Classics title card exists on this collection, nor any of the fake title reconstructions made previously.  Some of these restored title cards, such as those for ""The Chimp"" and ""Hog Wild"" are extremely rare, and are presented here for the first time ever on home video.  While the cuts in earlier collections were minor, this collection is entirely uncut.

There are minor downsides to the collection.  Like most non-studio DVDs, this collection does not contain subtitles of any sort on any of the English language shorts (however, they are provided for the foreign language shorts).  The feature ""Pardon Us"" is an extended re-release version--the original release version circulates, so its an odd exclusion.  And, while I did not get any scratches ore glue spots, the sleeve-style of packaging is still a bit worrisome.  Yet these are honestly nit-picks compared to how much this collection manages to do right in showcasing a legendary career of hilarious and timeless classics.

In closing, this is as ""essential"" as the product indicates.  However, considering the age and abuse the films underwent, it would be best to expect a release similar to Flicker Alley's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chaplin-At-Keystone-An-International-Collaboration-of-34-Original-Films/dp/B003YBNNMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chaplin At Keystone: An International Collaboration of 34 Original Films</a>--long neglected films that are presented as best as what is possible by a smaller company.",1320105600,23,3903,5.243156199677939
4650948,5,B005BYBZKY,"These prints are an improvement on Hallmark releases and TCM broadcast versions. The textures are clearer as is the contrast. You can see makeup lines and things like bottles are noticeably sharper. But if you're expecting pristine, crystal clear, absolutely clean prints you will be disappointed. But since this is the first complete collection of their great series of sound shorts and Hal Roach feature films and since the package comes to about $2 per hour and $6 per disc, this is definitely a bargain. Only one of my discs had any kind of blemish on it and I like the space-saving package design. Seeing these familiar old films in greater clarity just makes them seem more real, fresh and funny.
Strangely, Jerry Lewis in the tribute feature claims that Stan found Oliver working in the Hal Roach construction department, put him into show business and taught him everything he knows. All of which is untrue so why would Jerry's statements be included in this tribute? Oliver began acting in films in 1914, 12 years before his teaming up with Stan. If you're paying tribute to somebody they should get their facts straight and not just pass along some misremembered secondhand celebrity stories.",1320019200,7,1202,4.926108374384237

The picture on most of the shorts still shakes and moves.  Editing marks, splices, edits, dirt, etc are still there.  Actually, the prints from TCM are in better shape than this.  I love the films, but this collection will not replace what I taped off of TCM.  The same is true for the Little Rascals shorts.  If you want to see restored and not just remastered, compare these shorts and films to what SONY did with the Stooges shorts.  I was expecting Laurel and Hardy to come close to that restoration.

4650950,5,B005BYBZKY,"I just opened this set and took a look at each DVD to see if there was any glue or scratches and, firstly, each DVD was loose in the pouch, so no having to dig in to get it out, and, only 1 DVD had a tiny little glue piece on it which came off easy. When taking each DVD out, and looking at the play side, all I saw was either nothing or, some stray cardboard bits which you just blow off and then the DVD is perfect.

so, in my set, not one DVD appeared to have scuffs or scratches. Then of course on the last page of this set, that stupid security thing and as a few others had mentioned here, when you take it off, it rips off the paper and so, this was a stupid idea to place it there.

On each page of this set, it has nice photos of the boys, and it has a nice glossiness to each page, and the info for each film is really nice, and makes you all excited ,as if this is the first time you will be watching these films and, in a way we are because of the beautiful prints they used!!

And any oppertunity to quote from them was a cause for knowing laughter from your peers.  Lines such as ""here's another fine mess"", or Can't you understand We've only got 15 cents?', or ""Twas ever thus"".  In any event this beautiful package covers all the Hall Roach comedies including the 3 reelers with I think the single exception of Babes In Toyland.  Each short looks great!

If you grew up watching these guys in the late 50's on Saturday morning tv, intuitively knew they were kind, gentle men who were also funny and you continue to have an affection for their comedy, you will want to buy this collection. I think these dvds come as close as baby boomers will get to the experience of seeing Stan and Ollie films on the big screen in the 1930's.

Now...

Has anyone looked at the documentary on disc 10? What the hell is Dean Martin's former partner talking about??? Where the hell is Gerry Louis [libel laws] getting his information? Hal Roach went to London to see Fred Karno's troupe and was so impressed with Stan Laurel that he brought him to America to star in pictures? And when he got here he did a test for Roach and Roach said he wasn't that good? And then Stan was walking near the studio commissary when he noticed a fat guy walking by with a pipe slung over his shoulder? This fat guy turned out to be Ollie and Ollie was working in the studio maintenance department and Stan said ""Hey...how would you like to be in show business?""?

At first I thought he was on drugs...then I thought I was on drugs and that I was hallucinating because how could such a well done set allow an interview like this to go out (without a laugh track)? Thank Heavens we have Dick Van Dyke, Chuck McCann, Tim Conway, Penn & Teller & SUPER DAVE Osborne.

As a matter fact the documentary should be entitled ""THE DAY THE CLOWN LIED"".

Just to have the cach of a former Colgate Comedy Hour Co-Host listed in your press release should not out weigh factual authenticity. I am just so happy that Rosina Lawrence's last husband was not alive to see this.

Other than that, this set ROCKS!!! BUY IT!!!",1319846400,7,1561,4.47887323943662
4650954,4,B005BYBZKY,"This is the box set that I've been waiting for for years: the complete Laurel & Hardy talkie collection remastered on DVD.  The quality of the transfers are uniformly excellent, but they haven't been restored and are therefore consistent with the quality of the prints they're taken from meaning dirt and film damage is evident as you watch them.  However, this does nothing to lessen the enjoyment of watching, and it's still the best these films have looked in years.  Anybody who grew up watching the faded and edited-for-commercials television versions will find this box set a real delight.  Time has done nothing to diminish the joy of Laurel & Hardy, and my young children were in stitches watching Ollie and Stan go through their antics.

And this brings me to the primary reason I deducted one star from my score: apart from the few foreign language films in this set, none of the films have closed captioning or subtitles.  I find this particularly disappointing since one of my children is Deaf, and while he can still enjoy the physical comedy of the boys, the dialog is inaccessible to him.  I don't know if this was a cost-saving measure or an oversight, but it's unfortunate and disappointing.

With that caveat aside, I can't think of any reason why old and new fans of Stan and Ollie shouldn't buy this excellent collection of some of the best comedy films ever made.",1319846400,7,1384,4.7375
4650955,5,B005BYBZKY,"For some strange reason, I have no trouble taking the DVD's out of the sleeves, and for some strange reason I am able to do so without scratching them. Giving these great classics a 1 or 2 star rating because you don't like the way they came is preposterous and is just plain whining.

I think the packaging is just fine - and I love all the details on each page with information on each picture. If the packaging on this set was in plastic Jewell cases like some of these reviews want, they would then be complaining about the $200.00 price tag that the more expensive packaging would command.  Bottom line, I gave this set 5 stars because it is, without question, the BEST Laurel and Hardy collection I have ever seen, and the movies deserve 5 stars and they look better than they ever have before on DVD.

It has all their sound shorts in one collection (and don't tell me how much better the British version was. I don't live in England and the DVD's won't work on American players). Some people were complaining about this set before it was even released - so with some of these 1 star critics it didn't even stand a chance.  I remember buying L&H super 8mm sound films for about $34.00 each back in the 70s. I never thought in those days I could one day own all the sound shorts for under 70 bucks. You can now write back and defend your 1 star poor packaging reviews, but I won't be reading them - I've seen quite enough of those thank you.

At least you can get these out of the slots and once you do, put each one in one of those plastic sleeves before returning it to the cardboard slot and you'll be good to go. Laurel And Hardy fans have waited so long for something like this in the U.S., seems unfair to give it a 1 star rating just because of that. Sad fact is, in this day when people can download for free they have to have cheap packaging to pass the savings on to the consumer. If this had fancy packaging it would easily be 150 bucks or more for a 10 disc set. The die hard fans like me would pay more for a set with deluxe packaging, but most people wouldn't. Anyway, as for the material, I've never seen the shows look better. Everything you could ask for is here, even 2 versions of some shorts. I'm 40 and have been a fan of these guys since my dad showed me some of their shorts when I was 7 or 8 or so.

Laurel and Hardy have occupied a special place in my heart ever since I was about nine years old, so you can imagine my great elation with Vivendi Entertainment's Essential DVD collection of films from the greatest comedy team in cinema history.

With this superlative set we get all the remastered sound shorts - including a few alternately filmed Spanish and French versions - as well as the Hal Roach features (excluding the previously released THE DEVIL'S BROTHER (1933), MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS (1934), BONNIE SCOTLAND (1935), THE FLYING DEUCES (1939), UTOPIA (1951), and L&H's 20th Century Fox output from the '40's). Every short has its original opening and end titles restored. Arranged in chronological order on ten discs, these are by far the best quality versions we can presently ask for in the home video format.

The extras feature personal reminiscences from the likes of Dick Van Dyke, Jerry Lewis, and Tim Conway. Commentaries on select titles are by L&H experts including Richard Bann, Randy Skretvedt, and Rich Correll. There's also a tour of then and now locations where various films were shot. Rounding out the special features are some shorts in which the boys made cameo appearances, one of which is ON THE LOOSE (1931) with Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts that was transferred from the original camera negative!

For a compilation this extensive, the packaging is user friendly and comes with concise plot synopses and notes on each film.

This is an important, long awaited release that is sure to delight anyone who admires the genius of Laurel and Hardy, and I enthusiastically give it my highest recommendation.",1319760000,6,1691,4.964664310954063
4650961,5,B005BYBZKY,"Being a huge laurel and hardy fan since I was a little kid, I have been waiting for a decent DVD set of their sound films to be produced. As a kid 45 years ago I was able to collect legal for sale 16mm prints of their classics thru a company called Blackhawk Films. This company used the best pre-print material that was available at the time to produce beautiful sharp original prints. I still own many of these prints today. I am very happy to report that for the most part the material they used for this DVD pressing looks as good, if not better than some of my 16mm prints. It is a wonderful collection of their sound films along with some international versions which were filmed with laurel and hardy doing the voices along with different cast members and in some cases extra scenes not found in the united states releases. If your a big fan of laurel and hardy you will really enjoy watching these different releases. As far as the way the discs are packaged, you may want to use a bit of care sliding the discs in and out of their slots. If you do it with care I doubt you will hurt the disc to any degree. I mean how many times will you really be sliding them in and out of the slots over the next several years anyway?

4650963,5,B005BYBZKY,"As other Reviewers have pointed out here, the tight sleeves are not user friendly..and lend to scratching. I've been convinced to transfer all the discs to premium jewel cases for CDs.
That's a good point (though not enough to rate a *) - because the contents are so ""essential"" to a Stan and Ollie fan. Great transfers!
What left this lifetime fan of L & H flabbergasted was the inclusion of overseas versions, particularly the Spanish language versios of BELOW ZERO, BLOTTO, and CHICKENS COME HOME. Both stars do a fine job of speaking their own lines - no awkward overdubs.
It appears that Hal Roach insisted on quality and so the stars did special takes for this market (following the USA takes). In some cases, different actors are used. And in one case, the films' length is approximately doubled! This means that POLITIQUERIAS (1931) is essentially the very first Laurel and Hardy feature!
Disc #10 features many Stan and Ollie ""proteges"", Jerry Lewis, Dick van Dyke, Bob Einstein, Chuck McCann, Penn and Teller, Tim Conway. Lewis and Van Dykeare the most interesting, particularly Jerry, as he goes into greatv detail about his real *working* relationship with Stan, on the movie THE BELLBOY. This Reviewer was quite disappointed when JL did not go into any detail on the ""stanLaurel"" character in the movie! Was Stan offered t epart? There *is* a youtube clip of Jerry apparently seeking laurel's approval of this idea, on video!
Both Jerry and Dick offer an intriquing explanation about SL's reluctance to appear in public.
Special note: Disc Two has a great running commentary on the music of Leroy Shields as employed in ANOTHER FINE MESS - and for years thereafter.
This collection will endure, as the comedy of Laurel and Hardy will.",1319673600,8,1747,4.885521885521886
4650964,1,B005BYBZKY,"I am glad these films have finally been released in the U.S, and a lot of care went into producing quality transfers. It's a shame that similar care didn't go into the packaging. It takes a great deal of effort to extricate a disc from its envelope without marring the disc surface with fingerprints. In the set I received, three of the discs were adhering to the inside of the envelope, making them especially difficult to remove. Once they broke free, I saw that several spots of glue were cemented on the disc surfaces of the three discs, rendering them unplayable. I recommend purchasing empty disc cases to store your discs so that they don't get scratched by the rough envelopes, and so that they are easily accessible. But most of all check your discs. I imagine that playing a disc with glue might ruin a DVD player. Players get hot while playing, and conceivably some of the glue might soften with the heat and drip into the workings of the DVD player. This packaging is akin to an act of vandalism.",1319673600,43,1008,4.543956043956044
4650965,5,B005BYBZKY,"Well, finally Stan and Babe have their talking Roach pictures released in a comprehensive collection for folks in the U.S.  While the silent shorts are under different ownership and, thus, do not appear, this set is outstanding as every effort has been made to include original titles and complete footage.  For instance, THEIR FIRST MISTAKE finally restores the original MGM titles (from 16mm, but that's all there is until a UCLA restoration is done) AND the closeup of Stan's envelope showing his address (cut for the Film Classics reissue).  The balance of the print is from a 35mm Film Classics print, including the telltale scratch in the lower right hand corner we've all come to know and love!  All the later MGM features have their original scored roaring lion logos.  The soundtracks are, for the most part, outstanding without heavy EQ'ing.  The streamliner version of A CHUMP AT OXFORD seems a bit ""cupped"" in its sound, but only to a minor degree.  Bottom line is, for novices, this is an outstanding and affordable way to enjoy truly the very best of Laurel and Hardy.  For diehard fans, this is a long-awaited dream come true.",1319673600,6,1141,4.845360824742268
4650966,5,B005BYBZKY,"The packaging leaves a bit to be desired (it's hard to get disks out of sleeves without touching the play side of disk) but aside from that this is a real treasure, easily my most satisfactory DVD purchase of this year and one of the highlights of my 1500+ title DVD collection. You have all 40 two and three reeler sound shorts and 10 sound features from the Hal Roach library which are prime Laurel & Hardy, absolutely their best work. The great majority of these films have not been available on DVD in Region 1 up until now. High definition transfers were from 35mm film prints and although no true restoration work has been done, they look better than anything I've ever seen on video or film. With a couple of exceptions (Film Classic reissue titles) all have the original main and end titles and the roaring MGM lion at the beginning. No color ""RHI presents"" at the beginning either!

UCLA is apparently beginning extensive restoration work on all of this material and a time may come when these films as presented here will not look so stellar but this restoration work will take many years to complete and with the decline in DVD sales there is no guarantee we will ever see these films looking any better for the home video market. If you're a Laurel and Hardy fan this is a no brainer...buy it and ENJOY!

One more thing...this set is a real bargain! 40 short films & 10 features plus some extras on 10 DVD's for $65 (Amazon's current price at the time of this writing). That's only $6.50 per disc. Anybody remember when one 8mm. magnetic sound two reeler from Blackhawk Films would set you back $25 in mid 1960's dollars? Towards the end of the film collecting era the same film in Super 8 sound was about $40 as I recall. Those narrow gauge film prints didn't look or sound nearly as good as these films do here either. At the full list price of $100 this would still be an amazing package.",1319673600,5,1903,4.4498567335243555
4650967,1,B005BYBZKY,"On the one hand I am gratfull for finally having access to this wonderful collection; but on the other hand
the packaging of the 10 disques is thoroughly unacceptable.  Each disque is housed very very tightly between
cardboard sleeves (as in a book) meaning retrieving and inserting a disque is sure to scratch its delicate playing surface.

Yeah!  I know!  I can go buy plastic cases . . . and I will do just that!  But isn't it a darn shame that that is necessary?  I might have
guessed this would happen as the same outfit is responsible for the poor packaging of the Little Rascal set.

We fans deserve better . . . whether we buy the set on sale at $64.99 or $99.99
_______________________

After I wrote the above review I sat down to carefully retrieve (and inspect) each disque from the heavy cardboard sleeves.

I am sorry to report that four (4) of the 10 disques have major scratches and/or abrasions . . . thus necessitating I request a replacement set from Amazon.

A huge shame, as the material is much nicer than on the UK set and the extras look very good.  But without the ability to understand what is being said, half the fun in watching L&H in these talkies is missing no matter how good the picture looks.

As-is, I recommend those who need captioning/subtitles to seek elsewhere.  TCM recently ran all 40 of the talkie shorts caption and continue to run some on Saturday mornings.  Meanwhile, many of the films can be found captioned/subtitled in other sources (including occasional showings on TCM.

Having the set is nearly worth it for the foreign releases alone, but it is still a disappointment from a personal perspective.  Frustrating especially as so many other sources (including the UK boxset) actually bothered to caption these films.",1319587200,65,1022,4.935672514619883

4650970,5,B005BYBZKY,"I just received this set today, and I am very happy with it. I have the 20 disc set from Europe, and I can tell you that these 10 disc remasters are far and away the best prints of these films that I have ever seen. There are no reissue titles.  All have their original titles opening with Leo the MGM lion. Extras are fun and informative, especially the second commentary track on ""Hog Wild."" Picture quality is excellent and the sound is as good as mono can be. There was concern in one review that the image was cropped for widescreen. That is not the case. All of the films are in their original aspect ratios of 1.33:1. There is some concern about the packaging, which overall I find attractive. However, the discs do reside in sleeves that you need to slide out, and could cause minor scratches. I also had two discs that had tiny glue spots on them, that I was able to remove fairly easily, and the discs played fine.
Aside from that little caveat, I highly recommend this set. As a lifelong Laurel and Hardy fan, I couldn't be happier with the quality of these prints. Incidentally, I have purchased all of the available Laurel and Hardy films over the years, on every format from VHS to Laser Disc to DVD, and I can assure you, Laurel and Hardy have never looked better on home video.",1319500800,215,1293,4.365145228215767

4650972,1,B005BYBZKY,"Let's start by saying that this reviewer is one of THE biggest fans of the Boys. Without a doubt they are arguably THE best comedy film team of all time and I,like SO many other fans of the Boys here in North America,have waited patiently(ok,maybe not so patiently)for a respectable release of their Roach material for years and years onto DVD.Europe,of course,beat us to the punch by quite a number of years with their spectacular releases,doing the Boys VERY proudly by them. What we have had on this side of the Atlantic are dribs and drabs and none are worth even mentioning. All by companies whose main goal was just to make a buck and all the while none really understanding or appreciating the significance of the material in their possession. MGM and Fox have thankfully released all they have had and even the Boys silents have been released but ironically as their talkies finally come out,they are now out of print.
So RHI Entertainment grabbed up the rights to the Boys Roach films and released them. The general consensus from alot of quarters,when news first broke,was here was finally someone who really cared. Did they?...let's see.
There are ten discs here,including all of their Roach material,except of course that already released by MGM,which includes all their shorts and features and some other great items. It is a beautiful set....at least in theory. I will never know because I never got past the initial stage of checking them.
I liken to what RHI has done here to a football player intercepting the ball and running down the field at full speed only to be tackled at the one yard line. As Maxwell Smart might have said ""Missed it,by THAT much"".I might also paraphrase another TV icon in the form of Scotty from Star Trek who said""The more complicated it gets,the easier it is to stuff up the plumbing"".
RHI has made this 10 disc set into like a large,thick book. Each page contains little blurbs about each film and between each page is a disc,inserted into a ""pouch"".A tiny,tiny portion of the disc edge is visible through a little half moon shaped cut-out in the cardboard sleeve/page. If you try and grab it with your finger tips you will definitely touch the playing surface and we all know what happens then. Can you imagine trying to do this over and over again as you take them out to watch them repeatedly?(and what fan won't?).Somewhere down the line,somehow,that disc will gets scuffed and/or scratched and becomes unplayable.
In taking one of these discs out I used a scratch free cloth to grab the tiny edge(should one have to use such special measures?).However upon examination of the discs I found almost all discs had some form of scratching and scuffing on them;either light or heavy. With packaging like this it is inevitable this would happen. I recall shaking my head over this very thing,when I first saw the set up for pre-sale back in August and my worst fears have come to life.
There have been ALOT of fancy packaged DVD sets come up for sale(some I have reviewed)and most all have been disastrous. The concepts are neat and eye catching but in reality,they simply,well, suck...big time. And unfortunately no one at RHI had the foresight,savvy or plain common sense to see that packaging such as this would never work properly. Just a plain double sided slim case with an insert for the film blurbs would have sufficed just nicely thank you very much;just keep it simple. Sure,nothing is ever foolproof when it comes to DVD packaging,but if it was cost they were worried about I would gladly have paid the few extra bucks to get a set that wasn't scuffed or scratched from the get go,and one that would stand up over time.
Well,here's another nice mess they have gotten us into folks. Unfortunately this time,we're talking about a treasure trove of the great Laurel and Hardy and a company that some thought finally gave a rats about the Boys. But instead they have completely blown it by,of all things,the ridiculous packaging.
If RHI had any pride in themselves as a company or really cared about this collection of classic films,they would take this set out of circulation pronto,and re-release them into a more suitable and simple set. One that isn't screwed up from the start and/or,if one is fortunate enough to get one unscathed from the get go,one that will stand up over time;which this one certainly will NOT.But don't go holding your collective breaths my friends. I haven't seen it happen yet and my spider-sense tells me it's not going to happen here.
However,I certainly wish my fellow Laurel and Hardy fans the best of luck with their sets. Check your discs carefully guys and gals,and if they are not pristine,send them back. RHI has to be sent a BIG message.",1319500800,68,4728,4.753041362530413

4650974,5,B005BYBZKY,"""Resurrection"" implies death.  The Boys have never really gone away, but now they're back in hi-def and it is indeed glorious.

All over the world, every second of every day around the clock, someone is laughing out loud at a Laurel & Hardy comedy.  A living stream of laughter emanating into the cosmic void is not a bad legacy from two exceptional members of our erratic species that sometimes seems hell-bent on destroying our planet and ourselves.

Perhaps it is that crazy, self-destructive nature, the constant fighting, quibbling, misunderstandings, grandiose plans gone wrong and the epic, deranged, escalating acts of getting even that makes the films of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy so universally relatable.  Clearly, we see ourselves.  But what makes The Boys themselves so popular is that underneath it all, there's genuine love.  No matter how horrible the mess they create, or who is truly at fault, they are always back together again with high hopes for whatever new adventure lies ahead.  We intuitively understand they love each other even though they never hugged on screen or spoke of their mutual high regard; it was always crystal clear they were best friends no matter what.

But purest pleasure of the best films of L&H is that amidst all the anarchic antics, there's that unexpected feeling of affection that leaks off the screen into our hearts and souls.  Stan and Ollie are icons of the best and worst of our human traits.  Childlike and innocent, they give us permission - no, they force us -- to laugh at the unfair vicissitudes of life; yet, at the same time, give us hope that somehow, someday, all will finally be OK.

The mystery of why we laugh or even what makes something funny is illusive.  Even Stan Laurel said, ""I only know how to make people laugh, not why.""  There are reports that when Stan and his wife (he had five) went to a nightclub, he was sometimes asked to stand, take a bow and say something.  Stan would confidently step into the spotlight, slowly blink in otherworldly bewilderment, and then say and do nothing.  Soon, the place was roaring with laughter.  Stan Laurel understood that the dead center, the sweet spot, the bull's eye of comedy was a Zen stillness that says: ""Here I am, I didn't ask to be here and I have no idea what it all means.""  Isn't thatr our most fundamental philosophical dilemma?  That's why, in the end, there's nothing left but to release a cosmic laugh in the face of God.  Stan Laurel was a genius that ranks with Bach, Michelangelo, Tesla, Einstein, Twain and Hawking.  He was the comic mind behind the duo.  He tapped directly into our collective DNA that recognizes the inexplicably absurd inexactitudes yet persistently mystical paradoxes of life itself.

According to Jerry Lewis, who knew and idolized Stan Laurel, it was Stan who said he discovered Ollie. According to Lewis, one day on the Hal Roach lot, Stan, fresh from the UK and a US vaudeville tour, spotted a large man carrying a pipe with red flags on both ends.  Stan said to Lewis, ""I immediately wanted to do something to upset the worker carrying the pipe and asked to meet him.""  Stan invited Ollie to step in front of the camera.  Ollie said, ""Anything would be better than what I'm doing, but I don't know anything about filmmaking, acting or comedy.""  Stan said, ""That's perfect.""  Soon, Roach paired them on screen and there was magic.  Reel magic.  Even if Lewisi fabricated this tall tale, Ollie's bewilderment of -- and love for  -- Stan was genuine and the audience recognized it immediately.

Vivendi/RHI is releasing a 10-disc set of L&H's restored sound films, shorts and features.  Long overdue in clean digital editions, the explanations for the long delay of these beloved films is hard to understand but may have something to do with licensing - and a lack of motivation or interest by certain uninformed individuals I won't name.

This nice-looking DVD set in a compact book style case with sturdy card stock sleeves includes: (Disc 1) UNACUSTOMED S WE ARE, BERTH MARKS, MEN 0'WAR, PERFECT DAY, THEY GO BOOM, THE HOOSE GOW, NOGHT OWLS, LADRONES, BLOTTO; (Disc 2) LA VIDA NOCTURNA, BRATS, BELOW ZERO, TIEMBLA Y TITUBEA, HOG WILD, THE L&H MURDER CASE, NOCHE DE DUENDES, ANOTHER FINE MESS; (Disc 3) BE BIG !, CHICKENS COME HOME, PPOLITIQUERIAS, LAUGHING GRAVY, LES CAROTTIERS; (Disc 4) LOS CALAVARAS, OUR WIFE, PARDON US, COME CLEAN, ONE GOOD TURN, BEAU HUNKS; (Disc 5) HELPMATES, ANY OLD PORT, THE MUSIC BOX, THE CHIMP, COUNTY HOSPITAL, SCRAM!, PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES, THEIR FIRST MISTAKE; (Disc 6) TOWED IN A HOLE, TWICE TWO, ME AND MY PAL, THE MIDNIGHT PATROL, BUSY BODIES, DIRTY WORK, SONS OF THE DESERT, OLIVER THE EIGHTH, GOING BYE BYE !; (Disc 7) THEM THAR HILLS, THE LIVE GHOST, TIT FOR TAT, THE FIXER UPPERS, THICKER THAN WATER, THE BOHEMIAN GIRL; (Disc 8) OUR RELATIONS, WAY OUT WEST, SWISS MISS; (Disc 9) BLOCKHEADS, A CHUMP AT OXFORD, SAPS AT SEA; (Disc 10) A TRIBUTE TO L&H, ON LOCATION, L&H GUEST APPEARANCES and L&H TRAILERS.

Highlights: 1932's THE MUSIC BOX won an Oscar as Best Short Subject; PARDON US and CHUMP AT OXFORD are the rarely seen extended versions publicly previewed during the editing process; THE PERFECT DAY includes an optional Vitaphone disc track without incidental music and a faintly heard, but clear, expletive; POLITIQUERAS is the 56 minute Spanish version of CHICKENS COME HOME and features Hadjii Ali's truly astounding vaudeville act that must be seen to be believed; the TRIBUTE TO LAUREL AND HARDY, a too short 40 minute featurette on Disc 10, reveals the friendship, inspiration and love for Stan and Ollie in new interviews with Jerry Lewis, Dick Van Dyke among others.

Some of the films seem to be a continuation of the same story.  For instance TIT FOR TAT flows naturally into THEM THAR HILLS.  And HOG WILD can be seen as a prequel to COUNTY HOSPITAL.  BERTH MARKS can be understood as a lead up to BELOW ZERO.  There are more titles that work in the same way with wonderful results when paired back-to-back.  Equally fascinating are the foreign language titles that the boys filmed using phonetically written cue cards.

Missing from the collection is the truly disturbing and demented BABES IN TOYLAND (aka MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS available from Legend in a superbly colorized, pristine transfer the way Stan Laurel wished it had been filmed).

Finally, this core set of 57 of the 99 films The Boys made -- that's well over 30 hours of prime L&H! -- is now available for those of us who recognize that laughter is indeed the best medicine for our very human condition.

4650977,5,B005BYBZKY,"I find myself repeating this time and time again! Except for anamorphic and other widescreen processes that require special optics or equipment, every American theatrical film made after (and some during) 1953 was shot to be cropped for widescreen. Most non-anamorphic films during the early widescreen era were composed to be projected either widescreen or full frame to accommodate all theatres during the transition. There are a handful of films shot in 1952 and early 1953 that were released later with their credits configured for widescreen, where many shots were uncomfortably cropped because they were originally intended for 1.37:1. Such is the case with a handful of the Stooges films mentioned in other reviews, but the shorts from 1954 on were properly cropped as they would have been in theatres - and why shouldn't they be when our monitors today are all widescreen. To this day, that is how widescreen on 35mm is accomplished - so this is NOT ""fake"" widescreen. Take a look at [...] for a detailed education.

I don't believe for a second that these L&H shorts would be subjected to the heinous act of cropping when they were not intended for widescreen. What is heinous is how many people at home stretch these 1.37:1 frames to fill their HD monitors! Don't make assumptions based on the way posted still images were messed with.

Speaking of HD, why is there no Blu-Ray release of this collection when it was mastered in HD? I WILL be annoyed if we are expected to double-dip later.

I do like the company that put out the colorized version of March of the Wooden Soldiers with both the ORIGINAL TITLE-""Babes in Toyland""AND with the MGM Lion Logo original intro.  In regards to those who dislike colorization in whatever form, film or reason, I once met Lois Hall, Stan's daughter at a Sons of the Desert convention meeting in Mountain View a few years back.  I asked her about the colorized films and she told me flat out it was a dream of her fathers (Stan) to have several of their films FILMED in color- specifically ""Babes in Toyland"" and Stan's own produced ""Way Out West"".  Lois felt that had he been alive to see the colorization of their films, he would have been elated that this happened.  It should also be of note that even Leonard Maltin, for many years a hard critic of/against colorization publicly PRAISED the colorized version of ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" on many levels.

Laurel and Hardy made a number of silent films between 1927 and 1929, and most of these were released on DVD a number years ago in 9 volumes. These are now out of print, and a set of all 9 volumes is, as of right now, super-expensive. So, to obtain as complete a collection as possible, wait for these films to be re-released or buy them on VHS.

As for ""The Essential Collection"", each film is restored to the best condition possible, and many of the L&H films that exist in more than one version have both versions included. (European versions sometimes had more footage or alternate endings.)

Although colorized versions of several Laurel & Hardy films have been done, none are included here, which I think is good because including colorized versions along with the black & white originals would have resulted in a much larger, bulkier and pricier set.

There are approximately 50 films included in this collection. (Thank you, Scott MacGillivray, for listing the contents in your review!) While some are better than others, all of them are good. If you're not familiar with Laurel & Hardy's work, don't worry about deciding which film to watch first. You can pop in any disc in the set at random, and you're sure to see a great comedy.",1313107200,357,3786,7.180827886710239
4650982,4,B005BYBZKY,"Well, finally, the greatest comedians in history get their due respect by DVD manufacturers in the States. I want to be clear, this is a great and comprehensive set and any Laurel & Hardy fan will be well advised to pick up this treasure trove. I am sticking with the British box set  because A) it has all these films B) it has the silents and C) the packaging is better. Sure the awful colorized versions (is there any other kind, since colorization is, by definition, vandalism) mar that set, but overall, that set has everything I want. But I am happy about this set as a matter of principal. Laurel & Hardy brought laughter around the world and it's high time they got a respectable DVD release in the States. For all the fans in America, I am very happy, this set is a gem!",1312761600,12,779,4.335616438356165

Can't wait! I've already pre-ordered it. You have to wonder why they waited so long to bring these movie treasures to market. If Laurel & Hardy were to be RE-introduced to the general Movie-viewing public, it would immediately usher in a WORLDWIDE Laurel & Hardy renaissance! Today, more than ever before in our shaky economy, it goes without saying that laughter IS still the best medicine!",1312761600,13,418,4.819444444444445
4650984,5,B005BYBZKY,"I just wanted to say that I, for one, am very glad that none of these films will be colorized. Colorization is a form of vandalism. Restored, remaster, and preserve these wonderful films, but never colorize them.",1312502400,36,212,4.756756756756757
4650985,5,B005BYBZKY,"This is something I never thought I'd see and that's a box set of Laurel and Hardy and their talking shorts and movies. Plus,there's also the foreign shorts,too,which is worth the price for the box set alone! Even though I wished this was on blu-ray,I'm not complaining by any means because this is perfect for a big Laurel and Hardy fan like myself. Now,I hope they come out with their silent shorts next time around. Glad to hear they're re-mastered and not some cheap knock-off like you see on this site..",1312416000,11,508,4.593406593406593
4650986,5,B005BYBZKY,"Those of us living in the UK have had access to all these shorts on DVD for several years now, so what is the inspiration to splash out on them again?  Well, the quality of the prints for one thing.

So, just imagine, ""Towed in a hole"" won't have that slight jump in it where they removed the sequence in which you see Stan's mouth move but don't hear anything.

Best of all though, I can't wait to own a perfect print of ""The Chimp"" complete with original title cards.

There is also a couple of hours of extras which sound interesting.

So for those reasons alone, even if you do have the 21 DVD UK box set, buy this one.

Just one question, why isn't  ""The Stolen Jools"", ""On The Loose"",""On The Wrong Trek"" or ""Pick a Star"" included as I believe they are all Hal Roach titles.",1312329600,9,779,4.1879194630872485
4650987,2,B005BYBZKY,"This set is not worth buying unless it is COLORIZED!  I will only buy L&H and only watch L&H in their beautiful colorized versions.  To the b/w fanatics and loons out there, and you've clearly demonstrated just what low-lifes you are, I say, feh.  Bring out an all COLORIZED L&H set and I will gladly buy.  Insist on COLOR and ONLY COLOR.  This is an update to my wonderful first review below.  Enjoy it again, won't you?  I firmly stand behind every wise and wonderful word I wrote and urge all to re-read my every pearl of wisdom.  Then if you think about responding, don't, because I don't care what you think.

Yes, it is good that L&H sound shorts are finally being released, BUT what about the beautiful colorized versions of all of these??  I only watch L&H in their colorized format, it makes them seem more current instead of like watching ancient films.  I would have liked to have seen in addition to the drab b/w all of these shorts and films in magnificant colorized versions.  If they really wanted to improve things, they could have re-colorized all of the shorts and films using 2012 modern technology to colorize these films.  What is available now as colorized was done back in the late '80's and early '90's when colorization was in it's infancy, today colorizing can be done to make them seem and look like the films were originally shot in color.  Newly colorized L&H, that's my real dream.  I have the British L&H 21 DVD Box set it includes the old colorized versions & b/w's of all short and films.  This American set should have RE-colorized them all using modern technology methods, then this set would have been a real treat.",1312156800,18,1651,4.5646258503401365
4650988,5,B005BYBZKY,"At last a nearly complete set of Hal Roach's sound L & H comedies has been released on DVD. It appears to contain nearly everything but the feature-length films ""Babes in Toyland,"" ""Flying Deuces,"" ""Bonnie Scotland"" and ""Fra Diavolo,"" but all of those are already available on DVD (the last two in one box set by Turner Classic Movies). Thanks to Shout! Factory for filling the void.",1312070400,15,383,4.731343283582089
4650989,5,B005BYBZKY,"For many years the talkie shorts and features made by Laurel and Hardy have languished in limbo, due to copyright and neglect. Now Shout Factory!, in my opinion the best DVD company today, is releasing those shorts and features in a ten disc set, that will include foreign versons of some of the films, and bonus features, and a booklet describing the films. Shout Factory! releases have always been outstanding, so this should be a great set. Thank you Shout! for finally giving Stan and Ollie their due on DVD, and how about releasing Charley Chase's sound shorts.",1311811200,10,566,4.785714285714286
4650990,5,B005BYBZKY,"This set is great. They did a wonderful job on the restoration. But I could have done without the spanish versions. Other than that, these treasures are great, and they still make me laugh out loud! My ten year old niece loves them.",1311724800,,232,4.4186046511627906
4650991,5,B005BYBZKY,"Have been wondering why Laurel and Hardy's films have only had scant dvd releases whereas The Three Stooges were getting their due on dvd box sets. Now the time has finally arrived and I can hardly wait. I have seen most of their films at one time or another, but to have most of them in a huge boxset is such a treat. And digitally remastered to boot, wow!
My favorite has to be Blotto, and I just love when they are having their laughing jag and Stan says, ""Wait till my wife finds out we stole her liquor!""
Thet were the greatest comedy team ever and their comedy is timeless.
They say dvds do not wear out, but with this boxset I will put that theory to the test.
Just received the set yesterday and was so excited but...they place the discs inside of cardboard and are very difficult to get out. I decided to put them in a ten dvd case I have and to no surprise two were scratched up pretty bad. My replacement has already been placed. Check very carefully when you get this set and put in other dvd cases unless you love having your dvds scratched to kingdom come.",1311638400,15,1070,4.224390243902439
4650992,5,B005BYBZKY,Fantastic. I have been waiting years for this to come to the U.S. Towed in a Hole is my favorite short and I cant wait to see it again. Lost all my VHS tapes years ago and am waiting loke a little kid in front of a candy shop to open.,1311465600,7,234,3.607843137254902
4650993,5,B005BYBZKY,I am very happy they are finally hopefully get the treatment they deserve. I have the british box set and it sufficed for years. They were the best. Talk to me in 700 or 800 thousand years when we might see 10% of their genius resurface. The one and only. I hope the prints are as good as the stooges remastered volumes. They were excellent. Thank you.,1311379200,5,352,4.268656716417911
4650994,5,B005BYBZKY,"For years ive wondered why Laurel and Hardy comedies did not have a proper release in the US. Well on Oct 25th, my prayers and millions of Laurel and Hardy fans will be answered. I cannot wait for the set! I like the design of the set but im sure people will complain the dvds will be scratched when they take it out. It's easily fixed if you put them in cd cases but I prefer it as is. I cant wait for the set, it's going be a good day.",1311292800,9,437,3.8131868131868134

8464620,5,B005BYBZKY,Beautiful prints of tons of very funny stuff.  No silent films here.  I have another box of 5 DVDs and this one is clearly superior.  The production people did a lot of work finding good prints and cleaning up what could be cleaned up.  I am reminded of the shock of watching W.C. Fields in the Criterion disks after the crappy stuff that we often encounter.  What a surprise to discover that movies from the Twenties & Thirties don't HAVE to be dim and flickery. Give these folks a medal!,1528588800,,489,4.388888888888889

8464626,5,B005BYBZKY,For Laurel & Hardy fans this is a dream set. While the films vary widely as to how the prints survive this is a beautifully put together record of the best looking prints that there are. In the early days of sound there were version made in Spanish and other languages with L&H phonetically speaking their parts in versions that are sometimes much longer than the U.S. releases. This ten disc set allows true L&H fans to have access to the majority of the Hal Roach work. Some of the prints have comment tracks that give some interesting insights to where and how these classic were done. Only wish that their silent films were included.,1521936000,,637,4.547826086956522
