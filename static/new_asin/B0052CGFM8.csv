8453783,3,B0052CGFM8,"During the summer of 2011, TNA began moving towards pushing new talent into the main event, which culminated at Bound For Glory that year when James Storm and Robert Roode graduated to the Heavyweight Title scene. These two events were, in a way, the last gasps for Rob Van Dam and Ken Anderson as main event players, though each of them would still be included in title matches sporadically. Still, there was significant change coming, and these events reflected a need for new faces.

Sacrifice was one of the worst events of the year with very few--if any--memorable matches. The lone bright spot was a match between AJ Styles and Tommy Dreamer that was a wild, hardcore style brawl. Other matches like Abyss/Crimson, Kendrick/Robbie E and the Tag Team Titles match were outright awful, and the main event between Sting and RVD underwhelmed.

Slammiversary faired better with a strong undercard saving a spotty main event. The Tag Team Titles, Samoa Joe/Crimson and Bully Ray/Styles matches were highlights, showcasing a variety of wrestling styles. There were still some missteps; the Knock Outs failed to deliver and the Abyss vs. the X-Division story continued to embarrass the promotion. The main event featured Kurt Angle and Jeff Jarrett capping off their feud in a strong, mat-based match. The TNA Title match was the best Sting had participated in 2011, but it still underwhelmed and suffered from poor execution with its screw job finish.

What really hurt these events was the noticeably disinterested crowds that didn't sustain their enthusiasm for an entire match. I'm sure some of these matches would've come off better had the crowd been given reason to invest in the product. These two shows are worth watching but they're not even close to the best of the year.",1408924800,,1780,4.986531986531986
8453784,4,B0052CGFM8,"Sacrifice 2011:

This is a pretty good show. After a barrage of bad shows this one is actually pretty good. Great X-Division title match, very refreshing mix tag match with Chyna that becomes a ""feel good"" match (which this storyline sorely needed). Unlike the Slammiversary 2010 RVD/Sting match. this main event is much better. It's similar in places to the first match, but just done better and Anderson's commentary helps it. Much better show.

Also for some reason they decided to put 30-minutes total of post-match interviews in places throughout the ppv instead of saving it as an extra after the show, plus it also has a 10-minute opening. This was never done before or after this event. I don't know why they did it this way, but it doesn't hurt it.

Slammiversary 2011

Another very decent show. There isn't too much to say outside of the main events but the matches are actually pretty good. The Last Man Standing Match is the highlight of this event and is pretty good. The Anderson/Sting match isn't bad at all, good story and some arena brawling. And a decent match to end the Angle/Jarrett feud. Plus 30 minutes of Post-Match Interviews

Overall a much better TNA dvd to get your hands on. I recommend it.",1404432000,,1219,4.704225352112676
8453785,5,B0052CGFM8,"I've noticed a bogus one star review so I decided to negate that review by giving a 5 star review...

In all fairness...I've watched these PPV's and I would rate them 3 out of 5 much like the other reviewer has already done.  I just think it's unfair for some so-called ""reviewer"" to intentionally give a product a 1 star rating when it's apparent that he or she hasn't even watched these PPVs due to the lack of an actual review of these PPVs.",1313971200,2,444,4.273809523809524

8453787,3,B0052CGFM8,"his is the seventh ""Cross The Line"" set from TNA but continuing to follow the pattern of the previous sets in that this is a double pack of two PPV's. These events happened after the Lockdown PPV with the biggest changes coming in TNA repacking themselves under the name of ""Impact Wrestling: Where Wrestling Matters.""

Sacrifice '11
Ink Inc. vs. Mexican America - Ink Inc. had issues with some of the anti-American statements made by Mexican America in the past few weeks leading to this match there. The main story continuing to be the issues between Moore & Neal as Rosita & Serena kept distracting the referee throughout the match to give M.A. an advantage but when they got involved one time too many, they argued over how to handle the situation. This was a solid encounter that had non-stop action but look out for the finish as Jesse Neal lands directly on his face.

Brian Kendrick vs. Robbie E - Kendrick gave a ""Ultimate Warrior"" style promo before the match & kept freaking out Robbie in the beginning with him showcasing his ""yoga/zen"" attitude down to wrestling in his robe to the point where Robbie kept calling him a ""freak"" & Cookie was freaked out when Kendrick preached how ""God Has A Plan For You!"" Robbie tried to use Kendrick's robe to choke him & even caused his mouth to bleed in what turned out to be another solid contest but the ending was just comedic as the beginning with Kendrick trying to show sportsmanship only for Robbie to be so confused saying ""What Is Wrong With You Bro!?! Your A Freak!""

Knockouts Champion Mickie James vs. Madison Rayne - This was the final encounter against each other with the special stipulation that Tara would be free of her contractual obligations to Madison if Mickie won the match & knowing that, Tara came to ringside despite being told by Madison to stay backstage. This was a nice match between the two but this was all about ""What Is Tara Going To Do"" as Madison kept ordering Tara to help her only for her to be conflicted as she held back from hitting Mickie, taking the knockout glove away from Madison, and Tara being the deciding factor in the victory.

X Division Champion Kazarain vs. Max Buck - They started out trying to ground each other before starting to pick up the pace with both men starting to pull out all the stops. Max performed such moves as a running powerbomb into the corner & a twisting diamond cutter from the top rope & 450 splash while Kaz pulled off such moves as a springboard twisting legdrop & a leaping sunset flip onto the floor that resulted in Max's head hitting the concrete floor. This got the crowd really hot & screaming ""This Is Wrestling"" which was the truth, this was a excellent wrestling match.

Crimson vs. Abyss - Before the match, Abyss gave one of the best promos I've ever seen from him. This was your average ""big man"" match that was very slow & really nothing of note as Abyss is limited in non-hardcore matches while Crimson is still ""green"" but able to showcase his strength with moves like a strong spear & D'Lo Brown's old ""Sky High"" powerbomb.

Tag Team Champions Beer Money vs. Matt Hardy & Chris Harris - For those TNA fans who weren't around back then, Chris Harris is James Storm's old tag team partner in America's Most Wanted who were the dominate team in TNA during the first four & half years of the company which Harris showcased on the way to the ring as he came out with the old AMW ring gear & theme song. Knowing the history between these two, Harris kept avoiding Storm whenever possible only to come in whenever he had an advantage with even Taz mentioning how Harris is out of shape & the strategy of the team being for Hardy to be the workhorse of the team which included working over Roode's back with various bearhugs & elbow drops. Storm eventually got his hands on Harris & beat him down including executing the hanging DDT before finishing him off with a move that was the trademark of AMW. This was a nice match as Beer Money were good as they naturally were while Hardy carried his team as Harris was very limited here.

No Disqualification Match: A.J. Styles vs. Tommy Dreamer - Tommy was conflicted for weeks in regards to what he had to do for his career leading into this match with A.J. & it was shown in the early moments that Dreamer was heavily conflicted as he went to the ropes telling the referee to have A.J. break the hold only for the referee to remind him that it's a ""No DQ"" match so A.J. didn't have to break causing Styles to yell at Dreamer ""You Made This Match Famous Now Wrestle!"" Dreamer eventually got on his game with moves like a boot in the corner that dropped A.J. hard while hitting A.J.'s head on the ringside steps. Styles retaliated by dumping soda on Dreamer's head before executing a springboard clothesline from the guardrail when Dreamer was crotched on it. The fight ended up in the crowd with both men turning up the intensity such as Styles chopping Dreamer over a wall before he rammed A.J. into another wall. Weapons came into play once they got back in the ring such as trash cans & tables (which was used in a creative way by Styles) before a weapon was reintroduced to A.J. by Dreamer that played an important factor in their last PPV encounter. Bully Ray made an appearance along with Daniels but it was a very impactful piledriver that made the difference here. Tommy Dreamer is known as the ""Innovator Of Violence"" for a reason as he's at his best when it comes to these brawling types of matches which A.J. showed that he's no stranger to it either as this was a great brutal brawl from start to finish.

Kurt Angle & Chyna vs. Jeff & Karen Jarrett - Due to Karen's constant involvement in Kurt's matches against Jeff, Kurt hired a woman to take care of Karen for him in what was revealed to be Jarrett's old nemesis in Chyna. This was under mixed-tag rules meaning only the same sex can wrestle each other. This was a different match than the previous ones we've seen from both men as this revolved around Chyna getting her hands on Karen with the in-ring action coming secondary. Kurt & Jeff mixed it up for a bit before Kurt tagged in Chyna before revealing a loophole in the rules that allowed Karen to remain safe by Chyna only for Kurt to later try to carry Karen to Chyna before being cut off again before Chyna did eventually get her hands on Karen. Kurt & Jeff did alright in the ring but this was a match that was setup to revolve around the women & that's exactly what it did but I'll give it credit in that it was still entertaining.

TNA Champion Sting vs. Rob Van Dam - Mr. Anderson won the battle royal on the previous Impact to receive the title shot at Slammiversary so he came out & did commentary on this match. Both men started off slow in the ring but started to pick up the pace when they went to the floor after Sting ducked RVD's attempted running leg lariat in the corner that went him over the top the floor. Both men attempted moves on using the railing only to miss before taking the match into the crowd. Sting & RVD took some punishment as both men went into the wall at one point while RVD also delivered a standing forward dropkick to Sting that had him land hard on the floor himself. As both men were very exhausted & beat up by the time they got back to the ring, they still were able to counter & block each other's signature moves to the point where it took two back to back Scorpion Deathdrops to make sure RVD stayed down for Sting to retain his championship. This was a very solid main event as it really picked up with the brawl in the crowd & didn't stop from there.

Slammiversary IX
TNA Tag Team Champions James Storm & Alex Shelley vs. British Invasion - With Bobby Roode having a shoulder injury, Shelley stepped up to defend his championship for him in this match while Roode did commentary. Storm & Shelley showed very good chemistry with each other as a team doing some good double team moves including one comedic eye poke (just watch to see how they set that up). The Brits decided to single out Shelley & work over him for a bit building up to making the hot tag to Storm. Their was a moment of miscommunication between Storm & Shelley but all four men worked together to deliver a solid opening match that had good action from bell to bell.

Matt Morgan vs. Scott Steiner - ""The D.N.A. Of TNA"" vs. ""The Generic Freak"" had Morgan in control early on to the point where Steiner had to cheat in order to get an advantage before he worked over Morgan on the ground to take away his height advantage. Both men relied on power moves such as various slams & suplexes with both men pulling out moves that were unexpected such as how Morgan was able to power out of the Steiner Recliner only for Steiner to counter that into a victory roll. I'll give both guys credit in that both worked a style to put this over as a grudge match but it wasn't anything more than a nice watchable match.

X Division Champion Abyss vs. Brian Kendrick vs. Kazarian - With Abyss making it clear that he was out to destroy the X division, Brian Kendrick came out more focused than we've ever seen him in TNA as he wasn't in his robe wardrobe nor had his peaceful ""zen"" attitude. Kaz & Kendrick tried to take Abyss on individually only for both men to fail causing both men to work together causing both men to get some offense in such as Kendrick pulling off a tornado DDT while Kaz almost got a win with a victory roll. Abyss stuck to the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" as he would take one guy out of the ring & work over the other in the ring such as Kaz's back with his plan working as eventually Kaz & Kendrick did turn on each other leading to Abyss being able to pick up the pieces. This match told a good story between all three men & did it's job in having Abyss come off as a dominate monster for the first time in a long time.

Crimson vs. Samoa Joe - The man with a current month long winning steak in TNA against the man who has the most memorable winning streak in TNA history with this PPV making the 6 year anniversary of Joe's debut in TNA that started that streak. Joe targeted Crimson's leg with various moves such as the dragon screw legwhip, a knee buster, legbars & kicks, and even Terry Funk's spinning toe hold. Crimson was able to showcase some offense of his own such as getting an armbar with his legs & tossing Joe with a t-bone suplex before Joe retailed with a suplex of his own & again going to the legs with a single leg crab with Crimson coming back with his skyhigh powerbomb. Joe was on his game here as he was in control for a majority of the match & carried Crimson to the best match of his career so far along with us seeing signs of the old ""Samoan Submission Machine"" that we haven't seen in recent memory.

Knockouts Champion Mickie James vs. Angelina Love - I'll be blunt here in that these girls had an off night (including the botched finish) as nothing was really special here past putting over the story of Winter constantly being a distraction for Mickie by getting involved many times throughout the match.

Last Man Standing Match: A.J. Styles vs. Bully Ray - Both men started off exchanging fist before the fight was taken to the outside where weapons got involved as Ray dropped Styles across the steps that were setup on it's side. Back in the ring, Ray kept chopping Styles chest with A.J. getting up each time & daring Ray to hit him again leaving visible welts on his chest each time. Both men kept fighting to the point where Ray took out his infamous chain only for Styles to use it & bust Ray open followed by a springboard 450 splash into the ring & fight back outside the ring to the stage area. A.J. delivered one hell of a visual with his running flying forearm smash off the stage onto Ray who was on the floor at the time & then climbed up the stage truss to drop an elbow off the top of that onto Ray who was laid out on a table before Styles took one hell of an impactful hit into the stage wall. This was without a doubt the match of the night as it was physically brutal with telling the story of A.J. Styles being a fighting man by taking Ray's best shot & demanding more while dishing out just as much punishment himself.

TNA Champion Sting vs. Mr. Anderson - After Anderson's constant showing of disrespect towards Sting for weeks & losing his match on Impact earlier in the week, Sting completely snapped & even wore a new variation of his face paint which continued here as he jumped Anderson early & beat him up towards the ring. They went into the crowd brawling & throwing each other into walls to the point where a cameraman tripped & fell when they were fighting back to the ring. Anderson tried to work over Sting's wrist by slamming it into the steps & wrapping it around the ringpost before using moves such as a hammerlock & various armbars. Sting was able to fight back & had Anderson beat before Eric Bischoff made his presence known & screwed Sting in a way that looked good on paper but just didn't come off well when executed. This was a good match putting over the various stories coming in (Sting's snapping while Bischoff trying to take away the power Sting has a TNA Champion while also screwing ""The Network"" in the process) with the only real bad thing being how the ending came off.

Kurt Angle vs. Jeff Jarrett - This was setup to be their final battle with the bonus stipulations of this being to determine the #1 contender for the TNA Championship with Angle's Olympic Gold Medals while Karen Angle wasn't at ringside allowing Kurt to finally get his one on one match. Both men started off early with some wrestling before Kurt got tossed over the top rope & landed on his shoulder which Jeff took advantage off by throwing him into steps shoulder first. Both men went back & forth as they knew each other so well that they were able to keep reversing & countering each other's holds such as Jarrett constantly escaping the anklelock while Kurt turned Jarrett over from a powerbomb into that hold. Jeff got desperate & used his trademark guitar (and removed the evidence for the first time ever that I can recall) to no avail before he applied his own anklelock before it was reversed for the final tapout. This was very good as both men worked a different match than their previous ones in that this was a straight up wrestling match that had both men having some well performed back & forth sequences that stands strong on it's own but didn't top their previous performances.

Sacrifice was a very solid show from top to bottom as it did it's job in giving you matches that were entertaining for what it was (mixed tag & Kendrick/Robbie) & filled with good wrestling. Slammiversary started off slow with some people having a bad night (Knockouts) & the first half of the PPV having matches that were nice & average but didn't really get out of first gear before picking up the pace with the second half of the PPV. In the end, both events had their share of good entertaining wrestling & it's two shows for the price of one so this is something worth a viewing.",1308182400,4,15082,4.401577626389387
