3819975,1,B001V7YZAM,A travesty.  Two movies for the here-to-fore price of 4.  Can you spell RIP-OFF!,1244592000,13,80,4.642857142857143
3819976,2,B001V7YZAM,"I totally agree with the reviewer who implied Acorn Media is short-changing the public, who consistently wait for the new Poirot DVDs episodes.  This set is minus two episodes, already available in Britain.

If you want all four episodes, ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead"", ""Cat Among the Pigeons"", ""Third Girl"" and ""Appointment With Death"" you can order it as ""Agatha Christie's Poirot - Collection 7 [DVD] [2008]"" from the  Amazon.uk website.  It is produced with a Region 2 DVD format; so you will need a DVD all-region player or one that has been adapted to play both Region-coded DVD's.  You can probably get this cheaper too from overseas than Acorn Media, which has consistently been over-priced and always behind in putting out the episodes of this Poirot series and other mystery series.",1244246400,8,784,5.0
3819977,1,B001V7YZAM,"This is in true sense a ""criminal offense"". Are you serious? The last volume (#7) released in region 2 contains 4 movies, therefore we are eagerly waiting for the grand U.S. release of this season, and now we come to know there are only two movies instead of four? Truely speaking, only most important novel among those four is ""appointment with death"" and that is excluded from this set (probably kept aside for the U.S. set 5). Or, I am not sure that amazon put the correct product description in their site!!! because in Acron's latest re-releases of POIROT, all the other movie volumes include 3 movies at least. Only this volume 4 has two. So, dear AMAZON, you also make sure that you are showing the correct information. If that's not the case, then I would say - Acron media is at its best (in terms of their business) to cheat U.S. Poirot-fans.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Poirot-The-Movie-Collection-Set-4/dp/B001V7YZAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Movie Collection - Set 4</a>",1241481600,22,1073,5.509090909090909
3819978,1,B001V7YZAM,"I was just browsing on Amazon and ran across this set, and I am truly offended by how Acorn is treating the Poirot fans in the U.S.  For the record, the two movies included in this set were released on Region 2 DVD last year, along with the other two movies from season 11 - ""Third Girl"" and ""Appointment with Death.""  And when I bought that set last year, it still cost me less than what Acorn is charging for this half-set.

As for the movies, ""Mrs. Ginty's Dead"" is classic Poirot.  It's very faithful to the novel, and by far my favorite episode of season 11.  I didn't care for Zo Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver in ""Cards on the Table,"" but she really grew on me in this episode.  The scene where she's collaborating with Robin on her play is hilarious.  ""Cat Among the Pigeons"" takes a few more liberties with the story, probably because Poirot didn't even appear in the novel until the end.  It's still pretty well done, even though the focus definitely shifts from the schoolgirls in the novel to the teachers in the movie.  I do wish they had come up with a better excuse to get Poirot involved in the action, though, because the reasons (both the real reason and his cover story) are frankly kind of dumb.  But that's a minor quibble.

I can't judge the bonus DVD, of course, but even if it's wonderful, it still wouldn't justify the price for this set.  If you like Poirot and British TV in general, I would strongly advise that you check out region-free DVD players.  They're surprisingly cheap nowadays.  You can buy the complete season 11 on Amazon UK, probably for less than what you'd pay for this set.  (Fair warning, though: ""Appointment with Death"" is really, really terrible.  ""Third Girl"" is pretty decent.)",1241049600,63,1725,4.516129032258065

Agatha Christie's Poirot, The Movie Collection, Set 4 consists of three discs. Two of the discs are each 93 minutes long and each contains a mystery staring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. The mysteries are Cat Among the Pigeons and McGinty's Dead. A third disc, 47 minutes long, titled ""Super Sleuths: Poirot"", contains behind the scenes interviews with Christie's famous detective, Poirot, and the supporting cast, his secretary Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran), his side kick Captain Hastings (Hugh Fraser), and his inside contact at Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Japp. These supporting characters do not appear in the two mysteries included in this set. In Cat Among the Pigeons Poirot mentions that his apartment is being remodeled and he asks his butler George to send him a suitcase of clothes. This is also a later period in the development of Poirot's personality. He is noticeably more aggressive, demanding and crritical. Ariadne Oliver, a best selling writer of mystery novels and Poirot's friend appears in Mrs. McGinty's Dead. The discs are in color, have stereo sound and are in the 16 to 9 wide screen format.

Cat Among the Pigeons (1959). Ali Yusuf prince of Ramat a rich country in Middle East gave a fortune in rubies to his friend and pilot, Bob Rawlinson. Rawlinson concealed the jewels in the handle of a tennis racket in his sister's luggage. An uprising took place in Ramat. Both Yusuf and Rawlinson were killed when their sabotaged plane crashed. Back in England, Meadowbank, the top school for young ladies, was in the throws of reorganizing and asked Poirot to observe and give them some suggestions. Then Miss Springer was killed with a lance in the Sports Pavilion. Inspector Kelsey interviewed everyone, and secretly the British Secret Service took notice. The Tennis racket with its valuable hidden gems changed hands. The gems were discovered by one of the students, who showed them to Poirot. There was another murder, an attempted murder, and a kidnapping. The complex interaction between the students and the faculty became even more tense, scrambled and intriguing. Poirot gathered all of the principals in the lounge and recounted the high points. The perpetrator was identified. The management of the school resolved that they would rebuild their reputation and again become the top school for young ladies in England.

Mrs. McGinty's Dead (1952). Mrs. McGinty was found dead with the back of her head smashed in. Her unemployed tenant, James Bentley, was suspected of the crime. He was arrested, charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. Chief Inspector Spence of the Kilchester Police, a close friend of Poirot, was on the Bentley case and went into all of the evidence very thoroughly. He had the feeling that Bentley was innocent, and told Poirot ""I know a lot more about murders than the Jurors"". Poirot agreed to dig into the murder and took up residence in Broadhinny, a slovenly run boarding house in the area. Poirot came across Ariadne Oliver, a writer of mystery novels and an old friend who provided some useful intuitive reasoning about the case. He found that several of Mrs. McGinty's employers had reasons to have the case settled without an in depth investigation. When an unknown assailant made an attempt on Poirot's life, the investigation became even more serious. Poirot uncovered the real culprit, a miss-carriage of justice was averted and James Bentley was freed. Poirot saw to it that a female admirer of Bentley was present when he was released from prison.",1391558400,,3547,5.039182282793867
3820010,5,B001V7YZAM,"The two movies in this set are extremely well made.  David Suchet is the perfect Poirot.  ""I am the most famous detective in the world!""  In the first movie (Mrs. McGinty's Dead), Hercule has a lot of walking to do and puddles to contend with (not to mention fowls in a kitchen).  He's joined by Zoe Wanamaker (as the daffy writer Ariadne Oliver), whether he appreciates it or not.  .  My only complaint is there isn't enough of her in this mystery.  Her droll observations are hysterical.  Why didn't they give her a series of her own?  She might not be able to solve mysteries but it sure is fun watching her try.

Of the two movies, Cat Among the Pigeons is my favorite.  Things go horribly awry at an exclusive school for girls.  ""I didn't know she was going to get herself skewered, did I.""  There's diabolical doings that Hercule must solve when he finds himself a guest among too many girls.  Not everything is what it seems.",1391385600,,932,4.437869822485207
3820011,5,B001V7YZAM,"What new can I say about David Suchet??? No matter how expensive the DVD ,I buy it if he is there. There is no better Poirot !!!",1390867200,,128,3.7777777777777777
3820012,5,B001V7YZAM,"I chose this 5 Star rating because it deserves every one of them! It contains 2 of my favorite movies of all of them!
I love the ones that have Zoe Wanamaker in them. David Suchet and Zoe just have such chemistry in them as old friends, which makes them utterly believable! And in Mrs. McGinty's Dead, David Suchet is at his best and most keen and Zoe Wanamaker helps him along...sometimes to his chagrin! It's such fun to watch them together!
The plot and storyline are well written and carried out and it leaves you guessing right along with them who did what and WHY! Some of the characters are so unlikeable that you find yourself wishing...well, that they get it next! You know what I mean?!! Some do, too! Is that bad of me to say that? I wonder! But at any rate, it's fun to watch and the more you watch it, you seem to glean something that you missed before! Agatha Christie was such a perfectionist at hiding clues...right in front if you, wasn't she?! Guess that's why she's the the top ""Dame"" of mystery writers!
""Cat Among The Pigeons"" is a great one, too! It has mystery and intrigue on foreign ground that ends up sailing onto the sovereign soil of good old England herself! But they're all in for a fight to death when they realize that the infamous Hercule Poirot is their rival and NOT their ally! The battle is on and only one will win out...and as far as Hercule is concerned...they were the losers before they even began the fight! They just can't outwit HIS little grey cells!..and that of one little smart schoolgirl, too! Foolish to try, yes??!
I love the way the story weaves in and out with ""red herrings,"" so to speak! I love a good mystery and the ending of this one is so satisfying, too! Makes it a complete package all wrapped up by Mister P. himself! I recommend it highly!
You won't be disappointed!",1389916800,2,1831,4.404129793510324

3820026,5,B001V7YZAM,"The numbers of reviews submitted for the various packages of David Suchet's portrayal of Agatha Christie's beloved Belgian detective Hercules Poirot is testament enough as to its popularity, with many going into considerable detail about each episode covered.

I'm not about to clog up the reviews with more of the same. If you know who Poirot is there's no need, and if you don't, many of these other great reviews will fill you in nicely. I simply wish to say that each meticulously portrays the time period (1920s to 1940s before the series reaches its end) as only British productions can, and with actors who do not overplay their roles in sticking as closely as possible to Agatha Christie's books.

As some have noted, the original episodes have more of an Art Deco and often brighter and less-brooding look to them with the semi-regular characters of his aide, Captain Arthur Hastings (Hugh Fraser), his secretary Miss Felicity Lemon (Pauline Moran), and Scotland Yard Chief Inspector James Harold Japp (Philip Jackson), each of whom more or less faded from Christie's books after entering the mid- to late-1930s.

These later episodes, some of which were produced by the A&E Network but still stuck flawlessly to the period in appearance, began to take on a darker side in their storylines (as did her books), with the only recurring characters being George, his valet, and detective fiction writer Ariadne Oliver (played by the brilliant actress Zo Wannamaker).

The only episodes not yet available on DVD are those of the final season, which were filmed the past year - Elephants Can Remember, The Big Four, The Labours Of Hercules, Dead Man's Folly, and Curtain. The last, which brings our favourite detective, now wheelchair-ridden, back to Styles (now a retirement residence), but where it all began, also sees his death.

I have them all to date, and can't wait for these to be broadcast and then finally made available on DVD.",1364428800,3,1942,4.963076923076923
3820027,5,B001V7YZAM,"The acting, period sittings and cinematography are excellent.

But these two films are two of the best among all of the films, particularly ""Cat Among the Pigeons"". Great suspense, great casting and performances. I'm not really sure what I can add, but if you have never tried Poirot then these would be two good candidates to start with.

NOTE: I see a lot of negative reviews regarding the price of these Poirot Box Sets. I agree. I would never pay the list price that they want for these two movies, or another set with 3 movies, but that being said - you don't have to pay that. Amazon has thousands of other vendors here and I have never had a problem with any of the highly rated vendors. I don't always buy these products new. I have bought plenty of ""Like New"" and ""Very Good"" condition DVD's, Books, CD's and generally have never had a problem with these so called used products.

3820034,5,B001V7YZAM,"The majority of the less positive reviews (three or less stars) point to the fact that this set has only two movies, and I agree that this is a gyp. The extra on Super Sleuths: Poirot is interesting, but not only is it shorter than the movies but it is less entertaining (unless you like documentaries by a company/program promoting that company/program). I'm reviewing my impression on the product received.

I've previously seen the three in set 5 (two of which -- Appointment with Death and Third Girl -- are said to be part of this set in England), and if I ranked the five movies combined, my first and second favorite would be in this set. Could it be that I've read neither of the stories in this set while I either read or saw a previous movie adaptation of the set 5 group? Possibly.  But it could also be that they're better (or at least less dark).

I read one book on writing mysteries commenting that the days are gone where the detective is safe on a train with a dozen killers on board. It was nice to see Poirot in danger in Mrs. McGinty's Dead, and his reaction was a highlight. (Hope I haven't said enough to spoil it, but if I did, it doesn't spoil the mystery.) Additionally, there's a downplayed race-against-the-clock-to-save-an-innocent-man-from-the-noose storyline. As usual, the supporting cast is great and I was happy to see that the person I didn't want to be the killer wasn't. Nope, no hints who that is -- I don't want to spoil it!

While I enjoyed Mrs. McGinty's Dead, I loved Cat Among The Pigeons. While as a cat lover that shouldn't surprise me, again you had great acting and an effective story-line. One reviewer who read the book mentioned some variations from the book in this one such as Poirot showing up earlier (my hunch is that if Poirot doesn't show up to later in any story, the film version will find a way to get him there earlier so the star has a chance to be the star). So I'll probably read the book. But I really enjoyed the story.

The third DVD in this set is a less than an hour long documentary dealing with Agatha Christie, Poirot in books and the development of the series. Included is the info that they managed to work Japp, Hastings, and Miss Lemon more in the hour long episodes even if they weren't in the original story, but when it came to the movies they appeared only if they were in the original stories.

There is no plausible reason for this.  It seems to be some kind of game-playing price test.

Three first three collections are fine -- they contain the same programs I remember watching on television some years ago.  I suspect this collection is fine, too, but there's nothing special about it compared to the other three.  Therefore there's no legitimate reason to pay twice as much for it.

Like Joan Hickson, who is the definitive Miss Marple,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Marple-Set-1-Sleeping-Murder-A-Caribbean-Mystery-The-Mirror-Crack-d-from-Side-to-Side-4-50-from-Paddington/dp/B00005NKCL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Marple - Set 1 (Sleeping Murder / A Caribbean Mystery / The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side / 4:50 from Paddington)</a>, he seems to have captured not only the appearance of a character easily parodied but his very being as well. Though the movies have a breathtaking polish and are evocative of the eras of the 1920s and 1930s, I still find that the BBC/PBS TV series are my favorites for shear fun.  I miss the dearness of Captain Hastings and the precision and properness of Miss Lemon.  Their presence humanizes Hercule, and Hastings makes a perfect ""Watson.""  I have to admit, however, that some of Christies books are more dramatic than those produced for TV, and do not lend themselves well to a comic presentation. The two cinematized here are examples.

""Poirot Movie Collection Set Four"" is a superb pair of movies.  Both of Agatha Christies' stories, ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead"" and ""Cat Among the Pigeons,"" are very polished cinematic presentations, with an attention to detail that are the making both films.  Period clothing, makeup and hair styles subtly carry the ambiance of the 1930s such that the viewer knows this is a time gone by even without the antique automobiles.  The architecture and interior dcor are that wonderful blend of the ""old"" Art Nouveau and the ""new"" Art Deco that actually did faced off as one generation passed the torch to the next at that time.  The viewer senses the sentimentality of the old guard and the brusque sense of self-importance of the young without having to be told. Here the generation that fought WWI in their youth have grown up to take over during the 1920s and are starting to show their age during the 1930s as their own children grow up.  WWII is looming in the background, but with few exceptions the WWI generation is blissfully ignorant of it or trying very hard to pretend so.  The audience, aware of the events of the coming period, does know and will understand that these stories take place during a magical hiatus that is soon to come to an abrupt end.

Of the two my favorite film is the ""Cat Among the Pigeons.""  The girls' school setting, in fact even the music provided for the film, reminded me of Harry Potter's school time experiences, a magic blend of the sinister and the sweet.  The characters of the various staff members and of each of the girls are very well done.  My favorite is the Schoolmistress, Miss Bulstrode, played with such ability by Harriet Walter who made a wonderful Harriet Vane in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dorothy-L-Sayers-Mysteries-The-Lord-Peter-Wimsey-Harriet-Vane-Collection-Strong-Poison-Have-His-Carcass-Gaudy-Night/dp/B000062XDX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dorothy L.

The crime is carefully orchestrated with red herrings everywhere, and the dennoument is a surprise.

While ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead"" was not quite as powerful in its cinematic presentation or in its story appeal, it was definitely the better drama.  The concept of the eleventh hour reprieve of a man condemned to death for a murder he hadn't committed was captivating, and the story within a story of old crimes with present day repercussions was also intriguing.  I didn't care as much for the characters here as in the previous film, although the recurring Ariadne Oliver, played with zest by Zo Wanamaker who appeared as Rolanda Hooch the flying instructor and Quidich coach in Harry Potter,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerer-s-Stone-Ultimate-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B002GJT4XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>],  was quite endearing.

3820063,4,B001V7YZAM,"""There's nothing like boredom to make you write."" So said Agatha Christie, but I doubt many who attempt to write a novel do so for similar reasons. And asked about where she came up with her ideas, she responded once: ""They come suddenly, I even don't know how. Whenever: when I am listening to opera, walking on the street... they come from everywhere! Also, when a smart idea falls into your head, which you like, you have to build a believable story from it. Suddenly faces grow as well, one by one. And then comes this unpleasant day, when you have to sit down and everything what had beautifully grown put on paper. Yes, the first part is much more fun!""

Consider this exchange from the first film in this collection, Murder in the Mews:

Chief Inspector Japp: ""The important thing is, everyone seems agreed that Mrs. Allen was right-handed.""

Chief Inspector Japp: ""But it seems highly unlikely that a normally right-handed person would shoot themselves left-handed.""

Poirot: ""Yes. Of course, one must not jump to conclusions, mon ami.""

Chief Inspector Japp: ""Never mind about jumping to conclusions, Poirot.  This is a murder we're dealing with.""

But there was no murder.

I certainly enjoy Miss Christie's characters and her wordplay is expert at leading you to believe either what appears obvious when it is not or to dismiss the obvious much too quickly when she intends to confuse you.  Hercule Poirot, moreover, is a literary treasure brought to life by Miss Christie. He is an extraordinary character and ITV/A&E has done a superb job at providing wonderful art deco decor and visuals in which David Suchet plays Miss Christie's famed detective to perfection. (Albert Finney's Poirot, in the 1974 film ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" is accomplished, as well, & Peter Ustinov has given us some fine performances as Poirot, but Mr. Suchet has played the role with able consistency.) These films are simply just well crafted, well filmed, and acted with aplomb. These films are a feast of art deco sumptuousness and the plots and players live up to the decor.

3820070,3,B001V7YZAM,"I have loved Suchet's Poirot and that wonderful characterization is still to be found in these stories.
I also loved the art direction and cinematic style of the earlier stories in which Suchet appeared and that is not so evident in these films.

First the art direction. As others have noted, the ""deco"" feeling has been almost entirely lost, but I also find that the sense that the events being seen are taking place in a particular place at a particular time has also gone missing. The Poirot's I most love and repeatedly watch are the ones that are clearly taking place in England roughly ""between the wars"". I have noticed the decline in the sense of place and time in some of the films released shortly before these, but it is virtually absent in these two. I believe this is mostly a matter of changed art direction and set decoration.

As to cinematic style. This appears to be a matter of both editing and directoral choice. I find the editing abrupt and constantly jarring. In this way these two films are very similar to the Miss Marple films starring Geraldine McEwan, which I have never been able to sit through. It is not that find fault with Ms. McEwan's Miss Marple. She is fine. But the editing is too abrupt, to quick, too modern for the period in which the stories are set.

And then there is direction. These two films are so ""artificial"". Poirot is definitely an eccentric, almost fanciful, character, but Suchet has consistently managed to make Poirot seem ""real"". In these two films the director has made choices that conflict with that hard won sense of reality. In ""Mrs. McGinty"" it seems that they stuck a diffusion filter on the lens and never took it off. As a result, even the scenes in which evidence is being gathered or Poirot's ""little grey cells"" are working with greatest clarity, have this dreamy, other-worldly quality. I do, however, wonder, given that we are all a bit vain... Mr. Suchet is now one of the producers did his perfectly understandable desire to mask the effects of age have something to do with all this diffusion?

In addition, in many scenes there is also atmospheric diffusion (aka fog). You can even see it in one of the stills on Amazon's Set 4 page (unless they've changed the still since I wrote this), which shows fog inside a room. I realize this technique is often used to show distance outdoors or to provide a sense of early morning or late afternoon brightness indoors, but here it is overdone and in combination with the lens diffusion the vagueness of the images is quite intrusive and at odds with the clear thinking that is integral to a mystery. Only at the end, during the dnouement scene does the diffusion filter finally come off and then, you have been looking at diffusion so long that, its sudden disappearance is also jarring.

The other problem I have is with the secondary characters. They so often irritable, loud, and ill-mannered (same as in the McEwan Marples). I first noticed this change in a few of the younger characters in ""The Hollow"", but in these stories it is as if everyone has completely forgotten their Edwardian and Georgian upbringing. Their nurses and nanny's would be most displeased.

I really do miss Miss Lemon, Chief Inspector Japp, and, especially, Hastings. I cannot recall if any of them appear in these particular novels, so this observation may be off point, but in general the presence of these three characters tended to humanize Poirot. In their presence he stopped being merely a great detective. He was less eccentric and more human because they were his friend and he theirs. The absence of that mutual affection and the occasional friendly jibe that affection engendered cuts Poirot off from the rest of human-kind and thus from us.

I confess that much of my criticism results from a comparison of the previous Poirots with the present crop. If the early ones had not been so excellent and so satisfying, these would be quite good enough and well above the standard set by U.S. television productions.",1251417600,80,4018,4.715099715099715
3820071,4,B001V7YZAM,"First, I wanted to say that the episodes are great.  Any fan of the series will enjoy them immensely.  My only criticism is the same one I have for all the recent vintage ""Poirots"" -- I miss Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Inspector Japp.  The onscreen interplay between these characters and Suchet was always superb, often providing comic relief, and made it a much more balanced mystery and enjoyable viewing experience.

That said, if one doesn't want to wait for these, I would suggest buying the UK versions on Amazon.co.uk.  There almost always easily a third cheaper -- even accounting for the increased shipping cost.  The only thing you have to do is buy a ""Region Free"" DVD player.  If you look on e*ay, you can find brand new ones from reputable sellers for around $100.  BTW, I don't sell them, so I'm not doing this for any self interest.  If you watch much British TV, it will pay for itself pretty quickly.  For example, I watch MI-5 --  Spooks in the UK.  I bought the 6th season 7 months before it was for sale in the US for less than half of what the US version now sells for.  When first released in the US, they wanted $70 for it.  I paid less than $40 for the UK version, delivered.  I've already watched the first two seasons of the ""Life On Mars"" sequel, ""Ashes to Ashes"" and am awaiting the release of the third and final season.  The second season of ""Life On Mars"" won't even be released in the U.S. until November.  Who knows when the sequel will be released.  I saw season two of ""Inspector Lewis"" over two years ago and season 3 last year.  They won't be released in the US until the fall.  Needless to say, if you like British drama, this opens ""a whole new world"" to you of shows that never saw US release.

There's a chance you can even configure your current DVD player as region free if it plays both PAL (European standard) and NTSC (US Standard) DVDs.  In the past, most DVD players were made for the worldwide market, so it was cheaper for manufacturers to make a single model that was able to convert both formats.  Now the DVD player markets are so large that's not necessarily cost effective.  But there are still some out there.  Do an internet search on ""DVD Hacks"" and you will find out if your model will do it.  Bose 321 systems play both PAL and NTSC systems.  Pressing a sequence of 5 buttons on the remote makes that system region free.  Most others that are capable of being set up region free are about that easy to convert.  Some require a firmware update. That's not hard to do, but I personally would just get one that I can reconfigure with my remote.  That's what most of the retailers of region free DVD players do.  So you are paying something of a premium for them to spend less than 5 minutes pushing a few buttons on the remote.  As I said, I did buy one region free but when I got my 321 system, I figured for the volume Bose sells, it wouldn't be cost effective to make a PAL version and an NTSC version, and I was right.  But as I said, there are PLENTY of cheaper alternatives out there.

The cheapest way to do it is to search and find models that are being sold as region free, check and see if others have successfully done it, and then buy the DVD player from the cheapest source you can find.  As I said, if you buy it region free, you will pay more for that, but then you are absolutely certain of what you are getting.

Anyway, just some food for thought.",1250985600,5,3420,4.297339593114241
3820072,2,B001V7YZAM,"I have every Suchet-Poirot and every Hickson-Marple.  These, taken together, may be the best television mysteries ever made, but this most recent and (probably) final bit is way, way below the par of the series.  Here's why:

-  Screenplay far below the standards.  Just not a lot to it.  The writer clearly thought that mysteries without any mystery was fun.
-  Settings and scenery and photography below the standards.  Prior entries always provided a lot of beauty and atmosphere in the settings, which recreated the 1930-1950 era.  These two fall flat.
-  Even David Suchet seems a bit wornout by doing the same old stuff in the same old way.
-  $35 bucks for just TWO movies?  Who are you kidding?  We English mystery fans are CHEAPOS!  We want GREAT mysteries by the GROSS and we don't want to pay this much for them, even though we are likely to watch them over and over.",1250726400,7,878,4.580645161290323

3820074,4,B001V7YZAM,"""Agatha Christie:Poirot, Set 4"", a British mystery television series made by ITV Global Entertainment, has aired on ITV1 in the United Kingdom since 1989, and on A & E and PBS in the United States.  Set 4 comes to us as a three-DVD set, timed to coincide with its late June 2009 TV debut on the Masterpiece Mystery! Show, Public Broadcasting System stations: Poirot is PBS's Mystery!'s most watched detective series. These are newly-made feature-length adaptations of Christie's ever-popular stories, starring the remarkable David Suchet, Poirot for a generation of TV viewers. They run approximately 186 minutes, plus, we get, on a third DVD,  a 47-minute bonus program, ""Super Sleuths,"" that explores the wide appeal of Christie's internationally famous Belgian detective, he of the curled mustache and active little gray cells, Hercule Poirot.  This DVD gives us interviews with stars Suchet, Philip Jackson (Chief Inspector Japp), Hugh Fraser ( Captain Hastings), and Pauline Moran (Miss Lemon); as well as longtime producer Brian Eastman, director Ed Bennett, and notable writer Anthony Horowitz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Series-1-5-From-Dunkirk-to-VE-Day/dp/B0024OW1QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day</a>).  Other special features include subtitles. (Thank you Acorn Media, though I actually found that I could follow the shows quite well without them, as characters clearly speak Standard English.)

These entertaining shows bear the trademarks of British TV: accuracy as to pre-World War II detail, lavish productions, grand estates, lovely scenery.  The guest stars are plentiful:  Zoe Wanamaker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Family-Season-1/dp/B000GB5MHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Family - Season 1</a>); Paul Rhys (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vincent-Theo/dp/B0028O9ZRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vincent & Theo</a>); Amanda Root (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B00003JRCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>); Sian Phillips (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Claudius/dp/B00004U12X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Claudius</a>), Emma Amos (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Detective-Complete-Collection/dp/B001HZ4K80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Detective: Complete Collection</a>), Harriet Walter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atonement/dp/B0013XZ6X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atonement </a>), Natasha Little (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanity-Fair/dp/B0006FO8E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanity Fair </a>), Claire Skinner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridget-Jones-s-Diary/dp/B00003CXT7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>), Susan Wooldridge (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jewel-in-the-Crown/dp/B001AXL67W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jewel in the Crown </a>), Anton Lesser (Miss Potter); and Katie Leung (the Harry Potter movies).  The scripts are witty, complex, and sharply-focused. As always, wrongdoers tend to underestimate the deductive powers of Christie's vain little detective, to their detriment.  The episodes are:
 Mrs. McGinty's Dead.  Old friend/mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver (Wanamaker) helps Poirot try to save a young man from hanging for a murder that he might not have done.  Christie has fun satirizing herself with the character.
 Cat Among the Pigeons.  Murder comes to the fashionable and prestigious private girls' school, the Meadowbank, where staff is busy trying to treat young Princess Shaista of Ramat, a political refugee dogged by her country's revolutionaries, like everyone else.

Anyone can see that there, are, controversially, but two stories here.  The releasing company may have had its reasons; among other things, only these two episodes have so far been shown here.  It may be that it's just not done to release these things on DVD before their debuts; it might not be allowed contractually, for all I know.  Whereas this set was released a week after the debuts.  And, the two episodes that are here are just excellent.  So get over it, make up your mind, and get on with it, as you choose to do.",1248480000,2,4491,7.534351145038168
3820075,4,B001V7YZAM,"I agree-the price is way too high. Suchet is great,but
the photography is unappealing on older equipment. Fuzzy,
[like the lens was dusty/foggy] and dark. I'm surprised
more reviewers haven't mentioned this. I do miss Ms. Lemon,
Inspector Japp (it's misleading to have them mentioned
in the ""headlines""). I appreciate having the subtitles.",1248307200,,339,5.415094339622642
3820076,1,B001V7YZAM,"DVD producers are just as susceptible to greed as any politician or CEO.  Here is a prime example.  Owing to Acorn's unwholesome greed, Amazon has to charge $45 (FORTY-FIVE DOLLARS)for a 2-disc set.  That is outrageous.  My advice: don't buy this.  Wait for the inevitable 4-disc set that will come out once the other 2 films have been shown in the U.S.  Or, conversely, wait until the price drops on this one owing to lack of interest at that ridiculous price ... the resellers will certainly be offering much more reasonable prices.  I like Suchet's Poirot as well as anyone, but I'm willing to wait.",1248134400,24,602,4.6761904761904765
3820077,5,B001V7YZAM,"David Suchet reprises his role of Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot in Series 9 of ""Poirot"", which dramatizes two of Agatha Christie's later novels. ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead"", published in 1952, and ""Cat Among the Pigeons"", published 1959, have been moved to the interwar years, as is customary in this series. It's called Season 11 in Britain and comprises four films there. PBS is only showing the first two films in the US this year, so this DVD set contains two films and a bonus disc with a 47-minute documentary. These are David Suchet's 58th and 59th personifications of Hercule Poirot since he stepped into the role in 1989. Suchet is visibly older now, having moved closer to the correct age for the ageless Poirot over the past 20 years.

It could be conceded that Poirot is an irritating little man. He is in the novels. And the detective's solutions seem conjured out of thin air. But he's fantastic to watch. This long-running Poirot series never fails to be visually captivating. Credit is due the actors, costumers, production designers, and cinematographers that make Poirot and his world look so fascinating. Of course, the 1930s are exotic-looking now, and, just as I loved the modernist designs of the series' early episodes, I found these new episodes have their own striking style. The focus is a little soft -perhaps to combat the effects of HD. Interiors tend to be quite dark, and the camera work out-of-doors is sometimes surprising. Both films have the same distinct visual style, but I'm not sure who is owed the credit, as they have different directors. They do have the same camera operator, Paul Donachie.

Screenwriter Mark Gates increases Poirot's presence in his adaptation of ""Cat Among the Pigeons"". Poirot visits the prestigious Meadowbanks School for girls where his friend Miss Bulstrode (Harriet Walter) is headmistress. After his ceremonial duties are done, Miss Bulstrode asks Poirot to help her choose a successor, as she is planning retirement. But the school's sadistic games mistress Miss Springer (Elizabeth Berrington) is murdered, and there is no shortage of people with motive. Or perhaps it has something to do with their celebrity student, Princess Shaista (Amara Karan), whose homeland has just suffered a coup d'tat. This film's atmosphere and the detestable Miss Springer make it a big improvement over the book.

Agatha Christie vented a little frustration at decades of writing the Poirot character in ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead"". Ariadne Oliver (Zoe Wanamaker) is a mystery novelist frustrated with one of her popular characters as she tries to write a play. Poirot has been asked by Superintendent Spence (Richard Hope) to re-investigate a murder. A young man, James Bentley (Joe Absolom), is sentenced to hang for murder of an elderly charwoman with whom he lodged. Spence is unsure of his guilt. So Poirot is off to Broadhinny to find someone with a motive. He finds a lack of transport, his friend the novelist, as well as a cast of eccentric, agitated suspects. Zoe Wanamaker is a real scene-stealer as the outspoken Ariadne and reason enough to see the film.

The DVDs (Acorn 2009 3-disc set): The two 90-minute films have their own discs. The third disc contains a ""Super Sleuths"" documentary (47 min) about the series, from its debut in 1989 to its final episode, which has not yet been seen.  David Suchet, Philip Jackson (who played Chief Inspector Japp), Hugh Fraser (who played Captain Hastings), Pauline Moran (who played Miss Lemon), producer (1989-2001) Brian Eastman, writers Anthony Horowitz and Clive Exton, and others talk about the character Poirot, Agatha Christie's creation of her most popular detective, how Poirot developed in the books and TV series, and how the series has evolved. Worth watching if you're a fan of the series. Subtitles available in English SDH.",1246924800,9,3833,5.0585443037974684
3820078,5,B001V7YZAM,"Even though well into his 60's, David Suchet continues to prove that he IS Hercule Poirot.  Yes, the eyes look a little tired & the belly a little full, but even the great Hercule Poirot must age.

These 90 minute movies deserve multiple viewings as the mysteries are intricate and you could miss a clue if you turn your head. The stories, based on the full length novels MRS MCGINTY'S DEAD and CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS, are more flushed out than the older 60 minute episodes.  One felt like clues were left out of those shorter episodes that prevented the viewer from solving the murder with Poirot.  But here, all of the clues are there for you the viewer to pick up on, but are they what they seem?

I do miss the regular cast of characters in the old 60 minute series, Inspector Japp, Captain hastings & Miss Lemon are sadly missing from the 90 minute ""Movie"" versions of Poirot.  However, they are present in the third disc which includes interviews with the actors who brought those characters to life.  And you get to see David Suchet without his Poirot mustache.

While the production values are excellent, the wonderful 'Art Deco' style of the earlier shows is missing.  I do wish they had kept that style going.  'Art Deco' buildings & objects do appear in these movies, but the style is gone from the production.

The bottom line is that I do like the more flushed out stories, but I miss some of the elements from the earlier productions.  Still they are a 'MUST-BUY"".

While I wish PBS would air all 4 new Poirot Movies this year (I don't know if it is due to budget cuts or not), it is nice to get to see at least two of the new productions and look forward to two more later on.  PBS is a co-producer of the series & they decide what Acorn Media can release in the U.S..

I have an early review copy & can say that the anamorphic 16:9 widescreen picture has some grain to it (it looked the same on the PBS-Hi Defenition broadcast).  The sub-titles can help with unfamiliar British words.  Bonus material is mostly limited to the 47 minute ""Super Sleuths"" special on disc #3.  Discs 1 & 2 have very basic still frame biographies & filmographies.  Quite honestly, the ""Super Sleuths"" special could have easily fit on a second layer of either disc 1 or 2, but it looks better to make it a 3-disc set.  At least they are 'slim cases' and do not take up too much space for the extra disc.",1245542400,82,2395,4.375565610859729
