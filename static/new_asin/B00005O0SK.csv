4236563,4,B00005O0SK,"The perfomance by Randy Travis and Michael Dutikoff were very understated. They both did a great job. I was able to work on this movie and Randy Travis actually shoots me. The opening scene is the only thing that makes this an R rated movie. Otherwise it is great! If you are going to watch it with the kids, start it after the whipping scene or have it cued up so they don't have to see it.",1220832000,,391,4.090909090909091
4236564,5,B00005O0SK,no problem,1439251200,,10,4.5
4236565,1,B00005O0SK,Previewed the movie before 'movie night with Grandkids' and thank goodness I did! It went right to the trash can! It was not rated but it should have been R rated.,1430006400,,163,4.290322580645161
4236566,1,B00005O0SK,"I was really disappointed with this movie.  The story plot was thin; the dialogue was poor; and the film was full of old spaghetti western cliches.  The sex scene was totally gratuitous and seemed to be thrown in as an afterthought to make the mayor not only villainous by a pervert to boot.  The only saving grace for me was that Michael Dudikoff who I really like was in it, but for the life of me I can't figure out why.",1414972800,2,423,4.197530864197531

4236568,5,B00005O0SK,Ordered this movie for my husband cause he actually seen it on t.v. and really liked it so I ordered it for him,1402444800,2,111,3.869565217391304
4236569,5,B00005O0SK,"I'm not normally into western, but I liked this one. He is a soldier on his way home. He comes across this woman being whipped and he stops it. He kills all the men that is doing it. He then takes her into this town so that she will heal. He ends up with all the men trying to kill him, but the don't do it. The women that he saved, save him and helps him heal. He then goes for revenge and get it. In the end he then rides off with the woman into the sunset.",1402272000,7,459,3.693877551020408
4236570,5,B00005O0SK,"I saw part of this movie on my cable western channel, but never got to see it from beginning to end. So I ordered it from Amazon. Good western with a great ending.",1398211200,2,163,3.9696969696969697
4236571,3,B00005O0SK,Looks like one of those Lifetime Network movies. Some decent gun fights and action. Acting is pretty good. Randy Travis is as good as the rest. At least nobody broke out int song! Worth watching.,1392422400,3,195,4.6
4236572,5,B00005O0SK,"I had never seen Michael Dudikoff, but he was good in this movie.  I wish there was a sequel or more westerns with him starring in them.  I just wish there were more decent westerns to view for those of us who like them!",1389571200,,220,3.977272727272727
4236573,3,B00005O0SK,average western; don't waste money if more than a couple of bucks.  The Lonesome Doves; 3:10 To Yumas; Appaloosas; and all those westerns have got me spoiled.  The lesser type have acting and stories as pitiful as the old 1930-50 b/w westerns (which I would sooner watch).,1384473600,2,272,4.76595744680851
4236574,3,B00005O0SK,"Michael Dudikoff has never been know for his acting but he is very likable in this western.  A famous war hero in passing through kind of town who gets caught up in the locals problems.  Betrayed and thought dead again he comes back with a score to settle with an old enemy.  Randy Travis is excellent as the nice bad guy.  Michael saves a dance hall girl, the town, and himself.  Typical but worth watching.",1373587200,,408,4.386666666666667
4236575,4,B00005O0SK,"very good movie,part of the way through,movie stopped.
movie would not start,without reloading,and bye pasting bad area.
other than that,excellent western,would recommend.",1370217600,,171,6.818181818181818
4236576,5,B00005O0SK,Not much to say but your delivery from time of order to when I received it was GREAT !! As far as my movie rating (GREAT).,1358899200,,122,3.730769230769231
4236577,5,B00005O0SK,"I love this movie, Michael is definitely a good cowboy actor.  He is awesome in this show.  love this show.",1356652800,,107,4.3
4236578,5,B00005O0SK,My husband thought it was great--got away from the modern type of western that try to substitue sex and violence for morals and a real story.,1350000000,,141,4.461538461538462
4236579,5,B00005O0SK,The movie ( Deadly Shooter ) I recieved it pretty fast and great shape and I am real satified with there service. The Movie is a Western movie with Randy Travis which is a real  good movie.,1344556800,,189,4.108108108108108
4236580,1,B00005O0SK,"Michael, Kyle Wendy, Jacob, Paul and Pete. Your kid's buddies down at the mall? Nope, the names of the most unlikely bunch of Western characters you will ever meet. But even without the teenybopper names, this script must have been written by a 13-year-old over his lunch hour. Full of nonsensical plot turns, like a steamy encounter with a prostitute that inexplicably turns deadly, this movie is so howlingly bad that my wife, who was about to turn in, stayed up instead to watch one gaffe after another.

About the only cool thing in the movie is the hero's .45 cal. Schofield revolver. There's even a scene where he ejects the spent cartridges and reloads, showing off this gun's advantages in combat. But the baddie takes it away from him early on like Junior Frenger did to Hoke Moseley in ""Miami Blues"", and he has to do most of his dirty work with a more conventional  Colt.

Michael Dudikoff in the title role has only one facial expression, the one where the next word out of his mouth is going to be ""Duuuuh"". He's the best of an inept lot. Randy Travis is so fresh and clean-cut in contrast to the sweaty, unshaven heavies that he looks like a 'toon imported from Disney.

So to sum up, bad acting, lots of inconsistencies and lapses in continuity, moronic dialog, what's not to like?",1333238400,,1296,4.573275862068965
4236581,5,B00005O0SK,"I liked it, several plot twists similar to today's movies and television shows.  A few things that are a little unbelieveable but it's a movie after all.  BN & violence, not for kids.",1333152000,,183,4.515151515151516
4236582,3,B00005O0SK,"Michael Dudikoff is the only reason I bought this movie, after American Ninja, this movie gives a whole new meaning to ""B"" movies. and not in a good way.  the acting is bad to say the least. The men in this movie are ether bullies or chicken.  the scrip is so second rate it has a smell all of its own. I can see why it did not sell to well, SAVE YOUR MONEY , rent if you want to see how bad it is.",1308614400,7,398,3.6705882352941175
4236583,5,B00005O0SK,"I purchased this movie on DVD and I'm not trading it back.  It will stay in our collection for future reviewing.  It is diffinately worth buying for watching and rewatching. I'm glad some new Western movies are coming out, even if some are remakes of the older ones.",1308009600,11,266,4.520833333333333
8411213,4,B00005O0SK,"ok for what it is, which is a pretty good western.  script is a little trite, and sometimes pretty implausible, but well acted",1527379200,,126,4.478260869565218

8411221,1,B00005O0SK,"Randy Travis is the villain?  What?  Very stupid movie. The great gunfighter main character had one expression on his face the entire movie-- vapidity.  Amateurish acting, directing, casting, writing.  This was like a spoof of a western plot but it was supposed to be serious.",1461283200,,276,5.066666666666666
