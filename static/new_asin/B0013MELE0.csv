While giving choices, the guidelines are clear and concise.",1391126400,,131,5.285714285714286
8252257,5,B0013MELE0,"when pregnant we dove into the subject of vaccines and found this dvd quite helpful, since it breaks down vaccine by vaccine. tells you pro and cons. I recommend this dvd.",1356220800,,171,4.548387096774194
8252258,5,B0013MELE0,"This DVD program has just been updated and expanded to 105 minutes. It is now a streaming video webinar which can be found at the ChildcareMediaDotCom website. Dr. Gordon presents what he calls a ""Third Point of View"" and calls for a more balanced an open discussion on our national immunological philosophy. First and foremost, he is the leading advocate for his patients and encourages all parents and caregivers to advocate for their child as both an individual and as a member of our society. ""Vaccinations?  A Parent's Guide to Decision Making"" is an essential resource for the parents of all newborns, babies and toddlers.",1316217600,2,628,4.980952380952381
8252259,2,B0013MELE0,"i will save you the trouble of buying this, he says that your one child, in the midst of all vaccinated children, doesnt need shots. but i don't think he is 100% accurate, and i eventually decided on a very delayed schedule for school entrance reasons. i don't want to risk my kids getting measles, because i will never know the vax status of everyone around them or what they have been exposed to.  i don't like when a source is 100% pro or against vaccination, because neither side is right.  so, this is somewhat too one sided for me.",1306800000,,537,4.36
8252260,5,B0013MELE0,"First, I have to say that there is one ""1 star"" review claiming that this video is essentially worthless because Dr. Gordon is not a proponent of vaccinating across the board. If you actually watch the presentation and listen to what he says, you will find that Dr. Gordon is both very intelligent and a good communicator. He is helping the viewer understand the diseases, the risks and how he goes through analyzing these issues for his patients. This is someone with a substantial amount of experience in pediatrics who has been in practice for many many years. Even if you don't end up agreeing with his approach in making the decision to vaccinate an individual one, based on a particular child's risk factors and exposures, you at least walk away with a lot of interesting knowledge about vaccines and the respective diseases. I personally found it fascinating and I am relatively well informed in the area.

Also, to address a comment that he doesn't follow the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations, I would add that we should keep in mind that the AAP and every other medical organization changes its views on many issues, oftentimes spurred by people who step outside of the box and look at things differently. Dr. Gordon is a pioneer in this regard. Remember just because an official organization thought the world was flat doesn't make it true.",1297382400,2,1365,4.858369098712446
8252261,1,B0013MELE0,"If you're a parent looking for quality information on how best to protect your child from serious preventable diseases, Jay Gordon is a poor source.

As can be judged not only by this video but by articles on his website and elsewhere, Gordon ignores the vaccine recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics and other leaders in the field of child and public health, in favor of his own claimed experience and antivaccine prejudices.

Gordon acknowledges discouraging parents from taking advantage of vaccines and (as of August 2010) has a glowing tribute on his website to the disgraced researcher Andrew Wakefield, whose flawed research and scaremongering about the MMR vaccine led to a resurgence of measles in Great Britain.

Listening to Gordon will put your child at risk.",1284854400,5,787,5.1328125
8252262,5,B0013MELE0,"Made me convinced that we MUST breastfeed our baby for at least a year to keep him from getting a bad illness and keep him super-healthy, whether or not we choose to vaccinate. Also, we will NOT be doing the chickenpox vaccine. This DVD and other sources have made it clear that the chickenpox vaccine is dangerous because it only lasts 10-15 years, and chickenpox, while not a big deal as a child, is VERY dangerous as a teenager or adult. Just say no to the chickenpox vaccine!! Just say yes to breastfeeding!! THANK YOU Dr. Gordon!!",1278720000,,535,4.525773195876289
8252263,5,B0013MELE0,"I thought this movie (actually a recorded seminar) was very insightful. A great addition to books on the pros and cons of vaccinating your child. Dr. Gordon shows that medical research and statistics indicate that most vaccinations are not necessary and may be more harmful than good. His method is to weigh the costs and the benefits for each individual child and situation. If you are going to keep your child at home (not in daycare) and breastfeed for as long as possible (2 years is recommended), and not travel out of the country, then chances are you do not need to vaccinate your child. Polio has essentially been eradicated from the U.S., while Hepatitis B is a vaccine for high-risk adults and teenagers such as HIV positives and drug users. Rotavirus is a vaccine against diarrhea - children can die if they become too dehydrated and receive no medical attention...The list goes on. Do your own research and make your own decision. And watch this great film!",1275523200,4,969,4.773809523809524
8252264,5,B0013MELE0,Dr Gordon's opinions are not extreme and he really presents very good information and helps parents make an informed choice. This DVD really helped me make my decisions about whether to vaccinate my son.,1204761600,7,203,5.0
