8315586,4,B00000IBPW,"Not bad for older looking anime.  I love Escaflowne and The Record of Lodoss War, and didn't really think this would prove all that great.  I was very entertained!  The ending however is kind of pathetic.  It's still worth while...check it out.",978739200,,244,4.738095238095238
8315587,5,B00000IBPW,I literally enjoyed it. I have not watched an anime that brought back my original  excitement in watching japanese animation.the animation style is crisp with the thick outlines that give depth to animations. The story is  well within sci-fi intellect.and it had a good pace with the detailed  schematics that comes with technified art. I really enjoyed discovering  matsumoto agin!,934243200,2,382,5.316666666666666
