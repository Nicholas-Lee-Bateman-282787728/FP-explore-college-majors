This is an action cartoon about a race car driver, his parents, male & female mechanics, older distant brother, mischievous younger brother and his pet chimp.

It is fun, always about a car race and an additional adventure.  Pure cartoon fantasy with the best car ever!!  Wish I had a car with saw blades, could jump-jump-jump, and go underwater!

Clean language and no iffy topics, just driving and racing.

Still remember every episode every made!",1353024000,3,536,4.824175824175824
