7441738,5,B015IKSNNM,"I purchased all 5 new ""30th Anniversary"" DVDs directly from Gilad's website and I love all of them.  These are all recent workouts from his TV show and not old recycled ones.  Each is about 21 min long and there are 2 workouts on each DVD.  I try and do 2 for a 40 min workout (I skip the cool down in the middle).  All these workouts target different body parts and have cardio mixed in it.  The Hawaiian location is beautiful, as always, and the music is good. Good for beginners-intermediates. You can watch a clip for each DVD on Gilad's website:  bodiesinmotionwithgilad.com",1447200000,22,579,4.519230769230769

8733715,5,B015IKSNNM,"Bought it...now if I would just use it more. I have to take breaks after using this for 10 minutes.  I am no longer 30; it's amazing how if you don't do heavy exercise daily, you get breathless when you do heavy exertion, and this is heavy! If that's what you want, you will love these videos. he's been on the air for years and is like a modern day Jack LaLane.",1513555200,,362,4.027777777777778
