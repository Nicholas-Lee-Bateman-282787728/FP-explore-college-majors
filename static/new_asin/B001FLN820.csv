But hardware wars is still funny even still, and it was definitely worth the price of admission.",1482278400,,277,4.431372549019608

8302125,5,B001FLN820,"This video contains parodies of Star Wars, Close Encounters, Apocalypse Now. They were filmed on a low budget, with makeshift special effects. The films are all very creative, and funny. I received this as a Christmas gift in 1980, and I still have it 30 years later, and watch it occasionally. You can't miss with this one.",1296777600,4,324,4.701754385964913
