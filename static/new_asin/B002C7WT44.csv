3904930,5,B002C7WT44,"in my opinion, Kelly McCann is ""The Best in the Business"" when it comes to real-world combatives and personal self defense readiness. I own pretty much everything he has ever produced on DVD and this DVD ranks along side all the rest in being superbly produced and edited, smooth flow and transition of material covered, and as always the very best in combative instructions anywhere.

Kelly McCann in my opinion is still at the top of his combative game. This DVD has NO flashy moves, or fancy flow drills or tumbling. It is down and dirty, stripped down to the core what you need to survive a knife fight. Bottom line, GET IT! You want be disappointed!

3904931,5,B002C7WT44,"McCann's motto is that less is more.  He couldn't be more right.  When you are scared out of your wits and your stress response kicks in due to a massive adrenaline dump in your system you need something simple and direct.  A fancy, complex system will get you killed.  This is the real deal, taught by people who have seen the dark and nasty side of life.  It dispels numerous myths, and will help make you more street smart. Learning this is easy.  Training for it is the tough part. Perhaps most importantly, this DVD addresses some of the legal pitfalls of using a knife for self defense. I highly recommend it.",1326844800,10,615,4.446428571428571
3904932,5,B002C7WT44,"Having been fortunate to have studied numerous knife fighting systems, like Kelly McCann, I believe ""less is more"" when it comes to proficiency with a blade.  This is why I liked this DVD so much better than most of the other ones I have seen and reviewed.

 He emphasizes the importance of being able to articulate why you had to use a knife during a physical confrontation.  He also shows various types of knives and explains the advantages and disadvantages of them.  His system only has five (or six if you count the forward thrust move) basic angles and he prefers to use only the ""saber"" grip with the thumb on top when practicing.  He also does not like to use rubber knives in dynamic practice sessions.  He prefers wood or metal trainers and using various pieces of safety equipment during practice sessions.

In conclusion, if you are seeking some complex ten thousand moves knife system, this is not the DVD for you.  However, if you are seeking a simple and effective knife system and are willing to practice realistically, this is the DVD for you.  As someone who has studied several complex systems before designing my own 4 angle method, I highly recommend this fantastic DVD by Kelly McCann.

8363527,5,B002C7WT44,This DVD is a great compliment to my current training. It provides easy and practical drills as well as some key points regarding reality scenarios based on McCanns experience. I have several of products and recommend this one too.,1437782400,,231,4.948717948717949

8363529,4,B002C7WT44,"...is an excellent short course in using a knife for self-protection.  As another reviewer has pointed out, it's focused on folding knives primarily.  I carried a folder 18 years before I switched to a fixed blade.  Most people who carry a blade for self-protection do carry a folder  The skill of drawing & deploying a folder requires a slightly greater time frame than drawing and deploying a fixed blade.  Pure & simple, a fixed blade is faster! (A slight edge perhaps, but an edge none the less. Old age and treachery dictate my personal self-protection decisions.)  McCann makes it clear that fighting with a knife against someone else with a knife is a place you just don't want to be.  I concur.  Knife fighting is a secondary skill. (Not discounting its lethal potential, just clarifying that a handgun is usually your first, best option.)
  If you're looking for a basic knife carry course, this one's as good as any I've seen.",1366070400,4,936,4.75776397515528
8363530,2,B002C7WT44,"I didn't like this DVD. honestly,  I was expecting more.  Sure, it includes a few good tips but that's it. If you have some previous knowledge about self-defense, I don't think you'll learn much in here.",1354233600,,203,4.611111111111111
8363531,5,B002C7WT44,"Kelly McCann's videos are some of the best in terms of teaching simple yet effective self defense moves. This knife defense DVD doesn't disappoint. He teaches a series of uncomplicated moves that, with practice, can increase your chances of surviving a violent encounter. I highly recommend this DVD along with his unarmed combatives series.",1348531200,4,341,5.333333333333333

He has a no nonsense, staight forward approach to his teaching.
You will learn something from him.",1341792000,,171,4.733333333333333
8363533,5,B002C7WT44,"After buying many of Kelly McCann's dvd's, this is as good as any that I have seen-and they are all excellent.  He provides a simple to learn, yet very complete, curriculum for using a knife to defend yourself.  He shows his personal preferences of knives to own, how to deploy them, drills on how to defend against a knife and drills to use it to defend yourself.  I have seen several videos throughout the years by other so called ""experts"" on knives.  McCann's video is better than any of them.",1341619200,5,497,4.488888888888889
8363534,5,B002C7WT44,"This one hour instruction DVD is full of easy to remember, effective techniques. The only drawback for me was that it focuses mostly on folders when it comes to deployment, while I carry a fixed-blade knife. Not a huge deal though, just a minor quibble. Most of the techniques shown are 100% applicable to anything from a small folder to a bowie or a Kabar.",1339200000,,357,4.507692307692308
8363535,5,B002C7WT44,"I have been involved in martial arts and weapons training for more than 25 years and I was not one to purchase DVDs as a substitute for training.  Well, money and time constraints forced me to consider this as a training option when I was a LEO.  I had read previous articles on Kelly McCann and the Crucible and felt I would give this one a try.  I watched a couple of times and based on my previous knife training with multiple attack angles, this was ""caveman"" simple.  You fight as you train and I feel that Mr. McCann's candor and experience makes this a pretty good DVD for your self defense training library.",1339027200,8,615,4.368421052631579
