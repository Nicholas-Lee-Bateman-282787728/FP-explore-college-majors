3853991,5,B0026IQTS6,"The graphics in this documentary are lively. Two very interesting, diverse pairs of debaters are followed, which creates human interest in the documentary.  One of these pairs, black students from an urban school, pose the valid question of whether the contemporary debate technique of ""spreading,"" which arose in response to timed debate portions, is elitist because it allows students time to present many arguments, which in turn necessitates much research by debaters (whose after-school time may be consumed by paid employment)as well as access to on-line databases that poorer school districts may not provide for their students.",1315785600,4,635,5.546391752577319
3853992,5,B0026IQTS6,This video is an essential tool for all Urban Debate Leagues.  I consider it a must view for all new debate coaches and new debaters.,1294963200,,133,4.32
3853993,3,B0026IQTS6,"This was an alright documentary... well made and somewhat entertaining; but nothing beyond that.

Initially seeing how debate works and getting to witness some events is very interesting, but the novelty wore off pretty quick for me and the kids chronicled just couldn't sustain my interest like I would have hoped. Of course it doesn't help that for most of the movie they are speaking at an ungodly speed to the point where most of the time you can't understand what they're saying. There are bright spots here for sure, and moments of clarity that I really enjoyed; but as a whole film I simply 'liked it', and couldn't bring myself to enjoy it any more than a three star rating would suggest. Resolved, if you are looking for a great film about speech and debate go with 'Rocket Science' instead, even though it's a fictional film it has way more heart.",1294272000,2,857,4.6381578947368425
3853994,5,B0026IQTS6,"This is a great expose on the state of high school debate as it is currently experienced.  However, although it is really aimed at the classroom, the product I purchased is limited to private viewing so now I will have to purchase the E-DVD from the company.",1249603200,3,258,4.48936170212766
3853995,5,B0026IQTS6,"This documentary is fun, educational, and provides great inspiration for any kid.  It showed at the L.A. Film Festival and generated amazing buzz.  Everyone I talked to loved it.  Of course cable picked it up.  Now, not surprisingly, it gets two Emmy nominations.  I thought New York Doll was amazing.  Resolved--Wow!  One Potato Productions scores again.  As a lawyer, I recommend this to any aspiring law student (or otherwise) who plans on a career where he or she will have to think and speak on his or her feet. As a partent, I recommend this to everyone who wants to teach their kids about hard work, commitment, and being engaged in life.  The fact that a U.S. Supreme Court Justice participated and appeared in this production speaks volumes about the important lessons that can be learned from this film.  Kudos to Whitely and One Potato.",1247616000,12,847,4.779310344827586
3853996,5,B0026IQTS6,"""Resolved"" is riveting from beginning to end. I appreciated the educational benefits such as learning about the complexity of high school debate and what ""spread"" is.  I was totally caught up in the lives of Sam Iola, Matt Andrews, Richard Funches and Louis Blackwell, all high school debaters with very different backgrounds. I liked the way this documentary weaved a story of hard work, triumph, and failure. It absolutely deserves the two Emmy nominations. I think teenagers would especially enjoy this film.",1247616000,10,511,5.2317073170731705
8352762,1,B0026IQTS6,"Absolutely useless- the film starts off by introducing some genuinely unlikable students.  They come across as pompous, annoying, elitist, and self-unaware.  This is not a good combination.  In fairness, maybe the film gets significantly better after the first few minutes but good luck making it that far.  Bring caffeine and maybe some magical device that makes you impervious to annoying teens.",1527206400,,397,5.459016393442623

8352764,1,B0026IQTS6,This video is a bootleg copy.  It does not work with my updated and current model Dell laptop computer.  Very disappointed and will return the product.,1476057600,,151,4.769230769230769

8352766,5,B0026IQTS6,"Use this movie in high school English class and it's always a big hit. Students are moved by the story and are able to engage in reflective discussion about any number of topics. I also use it to encourage them to question the practices and policies in education, just as the debaters from Long Beach challenged this particular style of competitive debate. Sometimes, for fun, I'll tell them that we're going to debate and I'll play them a clip and tell them that's how they'll have to debate.

8352769,3,B0026IQTS6,I couldn't understand the dialog -- the students were speaking so fast. It was a bit alarming. I didn't finish watching the whole thing. Maybe I should try again.,1386720000,,162,4.620689655172414
8352770,5,B0026IQTS6,"This movie has something for everyone: people not really into debate, and just wondering what it's like, and hardcore debaters who want to learn about alternative theory arguments. It had me completely enthralled throughout, and left me with a more thorough understanding of current debate structure and policy. If you are looking for a good movie to show a debate team, a class of high-schoolers, or just an inquiring mind, Resolved is the movie for you!",1352764800,2,455,5.0
8352771,5,B0026IQTS6,"All debaters really should view this video. It's a great story in its own right, and it also addresses many shortcomings/weaknesses of our current system of high school level debate. I even show it to my ""speech"" classes as a recruiting tool for debate. Does contain profanity, so be forewarded.",1334016000,,295,4.92
