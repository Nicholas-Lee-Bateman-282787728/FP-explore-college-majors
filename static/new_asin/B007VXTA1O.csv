5111661,3,B007VXTA1O,"Massive earthquakes are devastating the world, and volcanic eruptions, and there's only a guy from a publishing company and a college archaeology professor that can save it!  The guy from the publishing company is sent to British Columbia to pick up a manuscript from a reclusive author/psychic, and the professor is lured there by him on other pretenses, but they both arrive at the same time, more or less, only to find the psychic deceased.  Now they have only a strange rod and a few clues (some on video) as to what they are supposed to do.  Of course, saving the world is not that easy when you're being pursued by laughably ""sinister"" government agents with perfect indestructible hairstyles and cleft chins...oh yeah, and driving Escalades.  And now our hero and heroine are labeled as fugitives, by the government, because they have something that the government wants, not because they actually did anything wrong.  (Did you know, by the way, that an Escalade can outrun an oncoming earthquake?  A big selling point, I guess, for those of you that may want one.)  Anyway, the storyline is OK when you can overlook the cliches & stereotypes, and if you're game for imagining there there are Moai heads (as on Easter Island) somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.  I guess this is fairly entertaining if you can shut your brain off, since it is pretty ridiculous at times.  A passable time-waster, but it's not something worth seeing more than once.  3 out of 5",1344556800,16,1466,4.804780876494024
5111662,4,B007VXTA1O,"I really enjoyed this movie.  The stars, while known, aren't top box office rated but the acting really was excellent.  If you aren't into doomsday movies, this one isn't going to pull you into it.  For those of us who love this sort of thing, it was a fun new take on it.  Loved the way they used the Easter Island Heads in the story.  I've always been fascinated by the scientific speculation and folk philosophy surrounding those monoliths.  Honestly, if you are a sci-fi fan, you'll probably figure its worth a couple bucks to watch this flick.",1343952000,,548,4.540816326530612
5111663,4,B007VXTA1O,"I bought this because of the recommendation of the first guy to review this SyFy film.
Your choices are:

a) $15 for the DVD.
b) $20 for the Blu-Ray.
c) Steal it from the video shelf.
d) Buy a boot-legged copy.

I picked ""a)"" because it looks just fine on a 55"" TV through a Blu-Ray player's upscaler.

If ""b)"" was picked, I'm pretty certain that any clearer picture would have spoiled the
movie by making a lower budgetted film' CGI just look worse.

The last two choices are, clearly, illegal.

The other reviewer said that he had the hots for --- the second-billed --- Jewel Staite.
I'll make a point and not tell the other (I think he's ""MadMacs"") reviewer that my wife
and I think that JEWEL STAITE looks a lot like our niece who's away at Lawyer College.

The actors --- I live in Europe, and don't see many movies anymore --- were all VERY good
in their roles, despite the lack of any ""big name"" stars.

I enjoyed the film.

The writer/directr did a very good job with this bit of escapism.

The special effects were acceptable. The SFX suffered only beause of the SIZE of my TV.
I am sure the fore-ground inadequacies were due to budget restraints, but most of the stuff
in the background was excellent.... but THAT may be because I was amazed by how much this
actress ""Jewel Staite"" looked like one of my relatives.

I say if you like a good story (PG-13) you can watch in the family room with a minimal amount
of bad guys gettin' shot, THIS is your DVD/BRD!

Like the General says in the MAKING OF ""Great movie... and NO Vampires""

Harmless, entertaining, fluff worthy of purchase/rental.",1343952000,4,1598,4.434931506849315

5111665,5,B007VXTA1O,"I first thought that this would be a low budget version of 2012, but it was not at all.  The acting was good and special effects were good too.  I agree with the other reviewer, not big budget movie effects but above a TV movie. This movie is worth seeing for Scifi and action fans.  One thing that I thought was funny (minor detail) for those of you that watch the movie, notice how the phones and computers all look like they were from 2003, not 2012 :)",1343001600,3,455,4.1477272727272725
5111666,3,B007VXTA1O,"Let's face it, people who enjoy disaster movies have a special gift for suspending all reality.  If you are one of those people, you should enjoy this movie.  If you understand the term ""unobtainium"" and are ok with a movie centered around that premise, then you should enjoy this movie.  If you are a fan of ""Firefly"" then you should enjoy this movie (because it has Jewel Staite in it of course).  If you can handle ""better than tv"" but worse than ""in the theater"" disaster movies, then you should enjoy this movie.  If you love epic scale destruction (believable or not), then you should enjoy this movie.  If you like to pick apart a movie that has attempted to tackle a huge topic (destruction of the earth) with moderate success on a small budget, then you should enjoy nitpicking this movie.

Tips for enjoying this movie:

1) Go into it with an open mind and no expectations
2) Suspend all reality and understand that it's ok that rebar can tell us our future
3) Keep your eyes on Jewel Staite (because she's awsome)
4) Stop being so nitpicky.",1342828800,89,1051,4.523809523809524
5111667,4,B007VXTA1O,"Said it many times before, just like scratching a semi-decent winning lotto ticket, once in a very long while SciFi's Disaster/Monster/Alien Weekends produces a decent flick.

Clearly we're not talking anything near a well-funded mainstream production with all the bells and whistles like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Los-Angeles/dp/B0051BVQFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle Los Angeles</a>'. These flicks are made on the cheap, with rendered sfx commonly generated from desktop computers. But as always, it's the story that carries the film, not bells or whistles.

The aforementioned 'Battle' was a craptacular failure. Why? Because the plot was a pitiful retread; a story that was clichd and uninventive. It lacked a proper foundation to build on those pricey special effects. And when you do that - you doom your project to mediocrity, or worse. So when a feebly funded project like 'Doomsday' is produced, but carries with it a decent plot that's charged with cogent energy - I'm appreciative. Even if it doesn't qualify as a hit, I suspect many of these films do well enough in the marketplace to make the producers money. And as aside, these flicks make for a fun popcorn distraction for cinephiles waiting in the lulls between so-called blockbusters and important films.

In 'Doomsday' the events of a prophesied day of destruction begins to unfold, the film's characters have been unknowingly cast into a cosmic play whose actions will either save humankind or become unwitting participants in its annihilation.

A.J. Buckley plays Fox, a junior book editor who has been handpicked by a reclusive writer who hasn't been heard from for decades. An infamous scribe whose last book became a huge worldwide bestseller then promptly disappeared. Fox been offered a chance at a his newest tome, one the author has worked on for the past twenty years, and all he has to do is show up. He's understandably a bit freaked out and suggests a more experienced senior editor take the meeting, but his boss tells him that he won't risk the loss of the publication rights by not following the instructions down to the last detail - he's going.

Simultaneously, a field anthropologist is given the same instructions. The author has promised an incredible endowment to her program - and all she has to do is meet him at a specific time and place. The offer comes on the heels of her university's funding crunch, so she reluctantly leaves her dig to receive the check.

Unfortunately, neither will ever collect anything - the author died the day before sending out his instructions. All that remains is a video recording he made at the moment of his death.

Thus begins a high-paced adventure to try and unlock the secrets of the past. A past that included visitors from another place who gave humankind a very special gift. Countering their efforts - a nihilistic military officer who has himself been hunting for both the author and the gift in order to facilitate the breeding of a new human race, one made in the image of himself. He wants to become God.

The battle of who will obtain the gift and use it properly will determine the fate of the planet.

I have to be honest and admit that a fair portion of my enjoyment comes from watching Jewel Staite, on whom I've carried a film crush for many years. It would be too obvious to throw in all the adjectives, suffice to say: As far as I'm concerned she's one of the most stunning actresses of her generation.

Personal drooling aside, 'Doomsday' really was a decent budget-conscious thriller that I enjoyed.

5111685,3,B007VXTA1O,"This is a SyFy movie, so you know that you should have certain expectations. You realize going in that the writing is going to be lacking in science and wit, the special effects will be lackluster, & the actors will be too good for the movie. On each of these points, the movie delivers.

Unfortunately, it's not low enough quality to achieve true bad-science-fiction-greatness. The writing, though predicable and bad, is still better than most movies produced by SyFy. The production quality is almost what you'd expect from a somewhat enjoyable indie film. It's edited well and the blocking of scenes is decent. For bad sci fi, that's not a good thing.

Not to worry, it manages to bring back some badness by having tropey/stock/stereotyped characters. With characters like the ""elderly indigenous dude has to be a medicine man"" and the reclusive psychic, it puts itself back into the running for mildly enjoyably bad science fiction. And manages to keep itself in that spot.

It isn't a movie I would buy or rent or otherwise spend money to see, but you can see it for free from time-to-time on its original channel.",1426464000,,1119,4.817708333333333

At the same time, a supposedly savvy New York publisher buys a book sight unseen/unread that doesn't exist and sends a nitwit proofreader (A.J. Buckley) to fetch it.  As if that wasn't enough, the author who doesn't have a book, calls a professor (Jewel Staite) who looks all of twelve, to pop in for a tete-a-tete.  Soon.  Time's a-wastin' it's the end of the world!

Beyond goofy, there's also a pack of bad guys willing to kill for the book that doesn't exist and baring that, a magic rod that induces visions (or drug-free hallucinations if you're of a suspicious nature who thinks all this gobbledygook is a crock).  Apparently, this addlepated author is the new Nostradamus and overuses the magic rod to cough up scary visions of a future no one will enjoy.  Naturally, in movies of this type, all government agents are trigger happy madmen who want to shoot first, seize the magic rod, then run like crazy before the earth opens up and swallows them whole..........if a Volcano doesn't get them first, or an earthquake doesn't topple a building on them.  Take a deep breath, there's also a dark star heading our way, gobbling up the universe.  Do not despair, half of British Columbia disappears quickly and no one notices.  One of the characters suggests this might all be preposterous.  Fortunately, the same people who decorated Easter Island also did the same in the Pacific Northwest but then they buried it.  Decorator's remorse?

The filmmakers called this a ""supernatural sci-fi thriller.""  They could call it a cosmic can of worms for all that mattered; it's still a daffy premise.

5111725,3,B007VXTA1O,"I say this as somebody who likes a vast majority of SyFy's movies. Doomsday Prophecy actually did seem interesting in its idea, but I also approached it in trepidation in fear that it would be another Titanic II, Quantum Apocalypse, Alien vs. Hunter, Almighty Thor or 2010: Moby Dick. In my opinion though, although it is far from perfect or even brilliant, Doomsday Prophecy is one of their more tolerable efforts.

There is some cheesy dialogue, some of the supporting characters could have been better developed and some of the effects like with the ground cracking are rather cheap. The story is also uneven for me. The film does start off promisingly and for a while unlike some SyFy movies actually feels as though there is a story and an original one at that plus it is paced reasonably, but it does meander with a silly subplot involving some shady characters and few scenes that feel like filler rather than serving purpose to the story and an ending that feels rather rushed and abrupt.

On the other hand, the scenery is quite good and the editing and photography are an improvement over most SyFy efforts, not looking as slipshod as something like Titanic II, Mega Piranha or Dinocroc vs Supergator. The music is adequate even if nothing stands out as such and the sound is more authentic than some of the bizarre or misplaced sound effects I've heard in past SyFy movies. While there are some underdeveloped support characters, the leads are somewhat likable especially the protagonist. The cameos are decent and AJ Buckley is solid, but the best thing about Doomsday Prophecy is easily Jewel Staite, she looks very natural and gives her character a lot of charm and wide-eyed innocence.

5111727,4,B007VXTA1O,"I'm a disaster film enthusiast so I enjoyed this one although it's not really a great movie. The presence of Jewel Staite was sufficient excuse to watch the movie all the way through. She charmed me in Firefly and Serenity so I'm inclined to smile when I see her in a role since then; she has an infectious smile.

The movie focuses on one of the lesser publicized ""disaster threats"" the passage of the earth through the galactic equator. One can check and discover a great deal of information on the galactic plane and the galactic equator. It appears we pass through the galactic equator twice each year but appearantly earth has never passed through the galactic plane. According to an article I've read earth is about 75 to 100 light years north of the galactic plane.

The movie doesn't let this sort of detail interfere with a good disaster story; there is plenty of 2012 style earthquakes and huge openings in the ground along with the destruction of several well known cites so there should be something there for everyone.

The ending, at least, is original in my experience and is something I would not have dreamed up so I have to give it credit there. This is one you should rent before buying as it may or may not be one you'll want to watch again.",1348963200,,1261,4.521929824561403

General Slate (Alan Dale) knows something we do not. What we do know is the world is coming to an end and we suspect that Eric Fox (AJ Buckley) a modern-day Nostradamus has a manuscript that will help us survive; he sends for a publisher to come and get it. Mean time he also send for an archeologist. The invitees may find more than they planned on.

The picked just the right actors for the particular characters. And we get some great shots of British Columbia.

The big question is will the mission succeed or be foiled at the last minute?

5111735,3,B007VXTA1O,"This movie is actually superior in terms of entertainment to some much larger budget end-of-the-world epics on the subject of Doomsday in 2012. The plot deals (vaguely) with this coincidence being predicted by the Mayans, ancient Polynesians of Easter Island . . . and some Canadian Indians. Odd since the last coincidence far predates any of those civilizations. No one explains why the plane of the solar system ""crossing the galactic equator"" wreaks such havoc on earth. No one explains why a prescient reclusive writer came into the possession of the one magical hematite rod (complete with handy carrying case) that allows the ""rightful"" owner to glimpse the future in visions. No one explains why a rogue DoD General knows about and is after said rod and why he insists our heroes be ""terminated with prejudice"". No one explains why there are seven Easter Island statues buried in Canada in a formation mimicing the constellation Canis Major, and why that's the magical defensive alignment for a secret weapon that echos ""The Fifth Element"", or why some roque object (dark star? brown dwarf? jupiter-like planet) is launched on a path of collision with the Earth by crossing the galactic equator.
Special effects are mostly a bit hokie and largely ""fractal"" earthquakes that erily seem to ""chase"" our heroes in their vehicle while running the length (practically) of half of North America.
The always-likeable Jewel Staite largely reprises a variant on the theme of her wonderful character from ""Firefly"", and few actresses project ""genuine empathy and well-intentioned pluck"" better that she did as Kayle (sp?) in ""Firefly"". The balance of the cast puts in a performance that at best is ""workmanlike"", which may reflect direction or writing as much as their talents. Yet Jewel somehow comes of as a person you'd love to have on your team if it was the ""end of the world"".
If you love ""geeky science fiction"" that you can enjoy with a few beers and a few friends, this will not challenge your intellect, but is fine light entertainment. Parts of it do call for the MSFT3000 treatment. It would have been good Saturday Matinee entertainment when I was a kid.
