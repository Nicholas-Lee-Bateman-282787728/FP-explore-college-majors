8446629,4,B004XC5LT6,"The Clone Returns Home is the type of foreign film you must get into vibe of to be able to appreciate. This is a quiet, existential film, a meditation on soul, self, and family. It is very pensive and a bit mysterious; it feels like reading a book and watching a nature show at the same time. The Clone Returns Home is definitely the type of film you have to be in the mood for, and if you are then it is a nice watch.",1444262400,,418,3.929411764705882

8446631,4,B004XC5LT6,"""The Clone Returns Home"" (2008 release from Japan; 110 min.) brings the story of a Japanese astronaut who, as the movie opens, we see in discussions with people at the Japanese Space Agency about possibly providing the necessary medical data so as to provide a back-up clone of himself. He hesitates about his decision. Meanwhile, in a parallel story, we also see him visiting with his ailing mom in the hospital. His mom keeps yearning for the life in the countryside. In a long flashback we learn that when he was a young boy (7 or 8 yrs. old) the astronaut actually had a twin brother but that in a terrible twist of fate, the twin brother died when he was trying to recue his brother from drowning in a swollen river, and drowned himself. Back in the main story, the austronaut goes ahead with the cloning project, and returns to work at the International Space Station. There he dies in an accident, and back on earth Japanese officials inform his widow about the back-up clone. She was unaware of it and is terribly confused. ""Don't play with him like he's a toy!"", she implores, but she gives in and the clone is brought to life. It is immediately clear that, while physically he looks exactly the same, spiritually and mentally things are not quite right. At this point we are about half-way into the movie and to tell you more of the plot surely would ruin your viewing experience.

Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is a science-fiction movie but is NOT an action movie, so if that is what you are looking for, stay away from this. Instead, ""The Clone Returns Home"" is a somber movie raising a lot of pointed questions about cloning and spirituality. This movie is slow-moving, and I mean that as a compliment. In quite a few scenes, the camera barely moves and there is no cutting awawy between different angles either. Instead, director Takeo Kimura simply lets the people talk and act, and it works great. Incidentally, this movie turned out to be the swan song for legendary Japanese director Kimura, who started making films in the 1940s and was deep into his 80s when he directed this.

Bottom line, if you are in the mood for truly something different, and don't mind getting some difficult issues posed to you as a viewer, you cannot go wrong with this. Needless to say this is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare. ""The Clone Returns Home"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1370476800,3,2404,4.640845070422535
8446632,3,B004XC5LT6,"This is the story of an astronaut who dies on a mission, and has his DNA cloned. Unfortunately, the resulting clone fixates on a tragic accident from his childhood and is unable to overcome this obsession.
  The Clone Returns Home is a film with a lot of promise that seems to lose it's way towards the end. The film is beautifully shot. I really enjoyed the cinematography, lighting, and overall visual presentation. I also thought the acting and direction was good. My biggest problem with this movie is that as it progresses, it all but abandons the interesting and philosophically rich plotline in favor of an artsy, but unfulfilling direction. I just felt, given the subject matter, there were so many questions about the soul and resonance, even the ethics of cloning, that could have been explored more. It felt like that's where they were heading and instead the last third of the movie devolves into not much more than some attractive shots of the clone walking through the countryside.
  There are a lot of things done well in this movie, and overall I enjoyed it. The pace is a little on the slow side, but I felt that was fine when the story was progressing, it's really the last third of the movie where it actually feels slow. Despite the inconsistencies, I still recommend this movie, especially to those more into the arthouse style.",1321574400,7,1349,4.727659574468085
