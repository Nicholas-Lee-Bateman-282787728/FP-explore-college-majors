8510783,5,B0076954MC,We bought this DVD For my sons birthday. He wasn't interested in the way the video was. He thought was going to more photos and not as much talking. But my husband watched it and found it to be very interesting.,1352160000,3,211,4.170731707317073
8510784,1,B0076954MC,"Where do I begin? From the terrible sound/video quality of what appears to be a home video camera... To the rambling, mumbling, incredibly boring lecturer... This movie is almost impossible to sit through. I am so mad I wasted my time and money on this. The first hour is just someone tape recording a man in a lecture hall recapping a story about removing a piece of metal from someone's arm. Ugh! Save yourself $15 and click NEXT. Otherwise don't act like you weren't warned.",1337644800,10,477,4.623529411764705
