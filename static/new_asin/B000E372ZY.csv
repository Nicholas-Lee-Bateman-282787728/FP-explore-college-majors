_________________________________________________

In a role not too different from years past, Dwayne Johnson stars in Brett Ratners Hercules. The movie follows Hercules as the son of Zeus, who after enduring 12 labors (tests), is haled as a god all over Athens. When Hercules and his half-brother Iolaus (Reese Ritchie) venture with their comrades to aide Lord Cotys in strengthening their army in return for gold, deception is sprung upon them. With a ruthless leader and a strengthened army, Hercules and his remaining fleet must fend for themselves and avenge the deaths of Hercules wife and kids.

Without question the movie is adventurous with great battle sequences and seeing the weaponry at hand. The charisma of Dwayne Johnson is awesome as you can tell he is comfortable in his role after doing similar roles in The Mummy Returns and The Scorpion King; among others. There is an element of fun as the film doesnt try to take itself too seriously. The pacing worked well considering the movie ran 97 minutes and kept moving without hitting any lulls along the way.

From the very first trailer you got the sense that there was hope for the film as it looked like a more serious take on the Hercules character. And with that, the signing of Dwayne Johnson brought more attention as he had the look for the part. Then as more trailers began sweeping the cinemas and the internet the more cheap looking it started to look like. The trailers were bombarded with special effects and almost came close to the Pompeii trailer a couple months back. After watching the film, as a whole, sadly their wasn't much to it as the plot was thin and didn't have much going for it.

There aren't any other stand-outs in the film other then Dwayne Johnson as he was the center piece of the entire movie. However, that in case is the problem since we don't really get a sense of desperation or feeling for any of the other characters. Receiving a PG-13 rating, the movie is directed more as a kids film with the set pieces and dialogue between characters. The pacing of the film was fine but without any character development to really connect with any or most of the characters they all became fillers. By the end of Hercules you feel like you won't remember the film after a week or so since it lacked any depth or from the simplification of the script.

Although the movie does have its flaws, the entertainment factor will help to overlook those issues in the end. What you get is a pure popcorn movie with a standout actor in Dwayne Johnson and all his glory.",1406505600,2,2615,4.676086956521739
2485212,4,B000E372ZY,"Nine Things about the Film ""Hercules"" [USA, 2014]

1. This is a very interesting version of the Hercules legend. But you need to know, the legend has been reinvented. The trailer for the movie is kind of misleading. This is not the Hercules you are used to..

2. The birth of Hercules, his childhood, and his legendary 12 labors are all pretty much done before the opening credits.

3. In this movie, Hercules is really just a human mercenary, with a team of warriors helping him out. His nephew has the sole job of making up the legends of Hercules and spreading them around to give Hercules a badass reputation.

4. It is set in a time when people are starting to doubt the existence of gods and magic, but still need something to believe in.

5. This movie has some really impressive, epic battle scenes.

6. Hercules's companions are a diverse and entertaining group. Ian McShane is especially good as Amphiaraus, who does drugs and gets ""visions from the gods"". Some of these visions come true, and some don't.

7. The movie does a good job of illustrating that some monsters you have to battle are psychological ones.

8. There are a few moments that contradict the movie's attempt to stay grounded in reality. That's annoying. But there aren't very many of them.

9. If you want a movie full of gods and monsters, you will leave the theater angry. If you like to see military battles, and a reflection on how heroes are made, you may appreciate it. This movie is certainly smarter and more layered than most movies of this type.",1406246400,388,1535,4.572992700729927
2485213,5,B000E372ZY,"Director, Producer and Script Writer Skills do matter and the results were fantastic.  Solid story line, great sets, outstanding special effects, actors delivered fine performances and Brett Ratner (director) and David Varod (Producer in Charge) teamed together to produce great entertainment.  Brett Ratner directed movies like Rush Hour and David Varod produced movies like the expendables.  Brett and David are my kind of dynamic duo and I hope they team up together in the future.  Many of the poor movies coming out of Hollywood are not the result of the actors;  given good directors, producers and script writers they can mold the actors to deliver highly entertaining films.  I'd like to see a director's/extended cut of this film on Blu Ray.  I will be buying the blu ray.",1406246400,10,781,5.0546875
2485214,5,B000E372ZY,I found this DVD excellent. As well as being entertained the viewer is taken through the life of Heracles with his adventures and pitfalls along the way. A viewer with no knowledge of the subject could easily follow the material.,1166745600,,229,4.75

2485634,4,B000E372ZY,"I was surprised that over 9,500 people reviewed a film with ""The Rock"" playing Hercules. I did not expect it to be good, but I was wrong. It is a good film, which has lots of action and lots of humor. We are told at the beginning that we will hear the true story of Hercules, and it is true that this version is truer that the myths. It tells us that all of the myths are lies or extreme exaggerations.
Hercules was not the son of the god Zeus. He did not do all the acts attributed to him alone; he had helpers and the labors were not as difficult as the myths claim. He did not kill his wife and children. This was part of his imagined post-traumatic syndrome; someone else killed his family. Furthermore, Hercules did not do what he did to help people, he was a mercenary who insisted on him and his friends being paid for what they did. In the most exciting part of the film, he needed an army of over a thousand soldiers that he and his companions had to train to do his job.
He had five companions: One was so disturbed by others that he sometimes acted like an animal and had to be chained. One was an amazon who was an excellent shot with her bow and arrow, and could even shoot several arrows at the same time. One was his nephew who made up stories about him, stories that became myths. The fourth was a friend since childhood who appeared to leave him near the films end. The fifth was a man who could foretell the future, sometimes.",1480464000,,1444,4.160714285714286

He doesn't take himself too seriously and appears to really enjoy the roles he plays.  The production is of high quality and while Dwayne's role seems to be the same in almost every movie, he is still fun to watch and laugh at.  The special effects aren't of George Lucas calibre but at least they aren't cheesy.",1479686400,,416,4.52
2485642,2,B000E372ZY,Bad acting,1479600000,,10,4.5
2485643,2,B000E372ZY,"Typical summer action movie I suppose. Very, very generic and average. The good things first- The Rock certainly looks the part and does a fine job even though I feel his character is a bit bland in this version. Ian McShane is awesome in everything and John Hurt is also a welcome sight. The action is solid but not incredible. The bad? Pretty much everything else. Most of the characters are generic and forgettable. There's too many of them and we don't get to know much about any of them. The plot isn't terrible but it never takes enough time to breathe and let the situation soak in. The ending is also rushed. The biggest problem I have with the movie is that it's yet another version of a mythological figure that tries to be all grounded and gritty. Hercules doesn't really fight any monsters here, instead it's just another generic war flick. They try with some humor to lighten it up but then things get real intense at the end. Somewhat of a clash with these tones, a better score would've helped also. The end credits feature a pop rock song, not exactly my style. Bottom line is this particular version lacks heart and a solid connection to the characters. Perhaps worth a watch, but don't expect much.",1479600000,,1216,4.557077625570776

2485890,3,B000E372ZY,For Hercules I was expecting more action scenes.,1477267200,,48,5.125
2485891,3,B000E372ZY,"This is an interesting take on the legend of Hercules. The idea mainly being ""What if Hercules legend was just that- a legend? What if Hercules was a real guy and really he just grew up on the streets later to become a mercenary?"" It's an interesting concept.
Unfortunately there is an over reliance on padding, montages, and meaningless back story in this. I'm not entirely surprised, though, as it was directed by Brett Ratner who is a director that takes on interesting ideas and fails to be very good at making them work well. For a little while he was successful with this because he was taking ideas that felt fresh so they held themselves by novelty. Now, he's mostly relegated to remaking old ideas. This can be fine, but Brett Ratner has very little talent (if any) so there's always going to be a problem. Especially with directing.
This movie is a cool idea, but I think where it really fails is that they decided to tell the story from the middle. When Hercules is already an established legend. I think this was done so they didn't have to own the idea whole heartedly. Maybe it failed as a story, but succeeded in other ways (and somehow they got to do a sequel) they could just take it all back and decide he is more legend than man after all. This is the type of half baked trash I expect from Brett Ratnet at this point, but it's still a real shame. Maybe if they wanted to start here that would be fine if they owned the concept entirely. Don't constantly go back to his past exploits for no reason. We get it. There is no magical creatures in your telling of Hercules. In reality the myths are more powerful than reality (as reality dictates this is always the case anyway). Don't constantly elude to the fact that magic really doesn't exist in this world, but then constantly go back and forth (""Maybe he is the son of Zues. Who could say?"").
Anyway, it's a great idea given to a terrible director so it doesn't live up to the potential of the concept.
I liked the casting choices here. Dwayne Johnson has become a skilled and likable action lead, and he fits Hercules fine (even though he's clearly Hawaiian, but don't worry I won't tell anybody ;) ). I liked all the actors cast as Hercules friends as well.
The story is inconsistent and full of padding. Whoever wrote it didn't really seem to know where to go with the story as they constantly show either montages, or long scenes of talking where nothing of importance is shared other than to express maybe Hercules is the son of a god, maybe he's not, but he certainly is famous. Oh, but really that wasn't a hydra. It was dudes with masks on.
Luckily the movie is fairly short, so you don't have to worry too much.
Also Ian Mcshane is in this so for me it's automatically fun at least for the 5 minutes he gets to be on screen. I especially liked his characters sensibility.
All in all I'd say this movie is fine as a rental. It's ok to see it once, but I wouldn't buy it. It's a great idea made by people with low IQs so it's maybe half of a good movie and half of a meandering drivel movie. Disney's Hercules is more consistently interesting, but this movie does have it's moments. Unfortunately they decided to make it ""realistic"" so none of the interesting stuff about Hercules shows up except when he throws a horse with a man riding it.",1477267200,2,3318,4.387987012987013

2485893,5,B000E372ZY,"The tale of Hercules has been done so many times this version with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was very good. A different version of the tale is worth watching if you are a fan of the Rock. Though at times it did not show the trials he had to endure but gave a short version so the viewer gets an idea as to how he was betrayed. Scenery was outstanding, plot not so much and characters were played fantastic by the actors given the dialogue they were given. Overall, I would watch any movie The Rock comes out in since I am a fan of his. Movie is worth watching to pass the day and to be amused for a couple of hours.",1477267200,,615,4.008130081300813

Seeing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson being cast as Hercules, and following all the training he put in to get his body (both upper and lower) to the size needed to respectably resemble the legend/myth proved he, for one, was all in on the project. Unfortunately, the 'writing' is just more lame Hollywood 'reimagining' of what the story is. I mean, the story is already written. Just get The Rock huge and beastly, have him perform the ""labors"" for Hera, and call it a wrap. Who doesn't want to see an actor that actually resembles what one might think of as Hercules take on crazy beast after insane monster?!? I for one did, and if your looking for that best look elsewhere.

The story here is just plain lame. It's a boring ride filled with all kinds of sidekick/team hijinks and jokes. And many of the actors playing his sidekicks are GREAT actors. Maybe they should have just named this ""Hercules and his merry minions?""",1475625600,,975,4.571428571428571

2487245,2,B000E372ZY,"To sum up the movie, without any spoilers: Incredibly typical action/war movie. Opens to show the obvious plot. The characters proceed along the expected plot line and, alas, the expected unexpected twist followed by the foreseeable setback. Then the slightly necessary rally cry (have to keep the movie somewhat interesting). And finally, the incredibly foreseeable conclusion. This is the extremely predictable and typical action/war movie. There is little done to veer from that plot line and it is obvious throughout the move. However, there is a reason that that plot line is so popular. (Make whatever you want of that.)
I found this movie hardly enjoyable, the acting was mediocre though the characters were well developed enough to have obvious motivation, which was also blatantly stated several times in the film. This was not the typical Hercules story, in fact it almost pick up where others leave off but wastes the name of Hercules. They could substitute any character in place of him and the story would lose nothing. He is just the name and face of a successful mercenary.
On a more positive note, this film is gracious to women, while they are still dressed provocatively and have unreasonable body standards, there is no woman in place as purely a love interest. Incredibly there is a woman among the most influential characters who is only sexualized by her appearance.  There are two somewhat dramatic fight scenes that are choreographed well on a budget. The visual effects are well done. You will be able to follow and predict the story line with little effort. That being said, there is a small chance that it will put you to sleep first.
I conclusion, I do not recommend this film and would suggest a classical war movie in its place. Even a spy movie would be better.",1470009600,,1792,4.8754098360655735

2487634,4,B000E372ZY,"If you are looking for an action/adventure film that puts a new spin on classic Greek mythology, then look no further. This movie will keep you engaged as well as entertained the entire time. The movie does a great job putting a realistic spin on the well known and often told Greek myth of Hercules. In the very beginning of the movie, it starts off as you would expect. They tell the narrative of Hercules' birth and his twelve labors. Then, without warning you begin to see that Hercules is nothing more than a mere mortal who has a band of warriors who help him decimate all that stands in front of them. The nephew of Hercules helps promote his myth along with his greatness in an effort to help them make their fortune as they work for one kingdom after the next. A nice twist is when the movie begins to revert back to the myth of Hercules and his greatness as a half mortal/half God.",1469232000,,891,4.341317365269461

2488348,4,B000E372ZY,"Fantastic take on the old tale of a guy just trying to do right by the people he was foisted upon to live with.  While it showed some of the myths to be a bit overblown in his case, it doesn't discount that all of the legends aren't as they are put out to be, and leaves room for some truly fantastic acts.  After all, an ordinary someone doesn't pull what Hercules did at the end and just walks it off.
One thing that really endears this to me is its symmetry to 2004's The Alamo, and Billy Bob Thornton's Davy Crockett.  In that movie Davy never claimed to do all the amazing things that tales said of him, but in the end still left a mark of legend about himself. It was really at that point that Santa Anna had lost the war. He just didn't realize it later until San Jacinto.",1466294400,,779,4.078431372549019

2488371,4,B000E372ZY,"Dwayne Johnson delivers a solid performance as a man who is also a myth, created by legend.  In this telling of the demi-god's tale, Hercules is the leader of a band of skilled mercenaries.  This mercenary team includes a story-teller who shamelessly markets the groups exploits as proof of Hercules' connection with the gods.  Though filled with well crafted action sequences, the heart of this film is a thoughtful exploration of how the Hercules legend developed and grew.  Is he the son of Zeus, or simply a very powerful and wise warrior?

This film could have become something truly special.  Unfortunately, as with many action films, great promise is offered in the first act, many fantastic and exciting problems are created in the second act, but then the third act solutions to these fantastic problems end up being a real stretch of credulity.  It's just difficult to believe Hercules and his handful of mercenaries can be trapped and then go head to head with thousands of soldiers.

Even with that fault, this film is a real hidden gem.  It had the misfortune to be released at the same time as Guardians of the Galaxy, so Hercules was completely overshadowed in its theatrical release.  Still, this is a good film, well worth your time.",1466294400,2,1250,4.826291079812207

In fact, I'd say if it weren't for him, the movie would probably have been a flop. That's because there wasn't anything really special about it; it feels like just another action ancient war film. There is an interesting plot twist at the end, but other than that, I didn't find anything overly special about the story. Another thing to keep in mind while watching this is that the writers seem to take a more practical reasoning to explain happenings in the film, and the spirituality in the film is reduced. This film is certainly no Clash of the Titans. Over all, I'd definitely recommend. There is not too much overtly sexual content, but a handful of innuendos are stated throughout the film. Violence is about what you'd expect for a PG-13 film. Thus, teenagers and mature children should be able to watch this.",1465084800,,920,4.685185185185185

As the story unfolded, I understood the ""real story"" of Hercules.  Still a question though.  Was he really the son of Zeus?  I think so, but that's just me.  I loved the story teller.  I thought he was funny at times (always ready to die in some dramatic way and then really glad he didn't)  He was almost right, but Hercules grabbed the lance/spear?, and threw it back.  Glad to see a female that could hold her own with the fellas.  I cried when the man that acted like an animal that Hercules saved died.  He spoke Hercules' name before he died.

2488649,3,B000E372ZY,"I'll start by saying that I totally expected this movie to be much more about the mythological figure than it was.  That's not to insinuate that this is a bad thing, mind you.

This movie is based on the comic book published by Radical Studios.  I was unfamiliar with the source material prior to watching the movie; that did not matter.  I found myself engaged with the tale told here from the beginning.  There were two things that held my attention most while watching this movie: the fact that Hercules seemed much more mortal than I expected (even in regard to his strength) and the fact that THIS Hercules didn't seem to be the hero that I have always associated with that name.

I won't spoil the story, but I WILL say this: the revelations told near the end of the movie shed quite a bit of light on why Hercules is the man that he is throughout.  I understood the nature of his personality and the journey that began in the back story before the movie begins.  Hercules seems to have found a bit more of his way by the end; I almost literally cheered for him by the movie's end.

The villains of the story were what you'd call ""classic' villains with a bit of a historic leaning to them.  How Herc and company get pulled into the conflict was handled quite well.

If you're looking for something that's more akin to ""Clash of the Titans"" style fare, you might find yourself disappointed.  However, if you're looking for an action film with some humor, this might be one that you can get into.",1464134400,,1501,4.418181818181818

2488932,5,B000E372ZY,"The reason this movie gets five starts is because Dwayne Johnson is the best.

If it wasn't for him this would be around a two star.

The problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what kind of movie it is.  It starts with a narration wich I find is a bad sign and goes from screw ball comedy, to serious To depressing to sci fi then back to comments like ""f%#^ing sentars"".

What's really confusing is that you don't know if he is actually a half God or a human.  They go back and forth with this for example his crew explains how they build up his story to make people believe his divinity(implying he isn't), then the next scene he throws a horse with a man in armor on it.

This happens several times and it's incredibly annoying.  He doesn't kill the hydra but three men wearing masks then in another scen hits a trailer with his hammer causing it to fly up and he kicks it twenty yards killing three bad guys.",1461715200,,920,4.193181818181818

2489185,5,B000E372ZY,"Dwayne Johnson is Hercules. Here stands a man of great strength, but with a broken soul. Perhaps not the legend that we know, but still a man who has done impossible things and not because he has Godly blood coursing through his veins or does he. Accused of a dastardly crime, chased from his Homeland, he is relegated to being a mercenary that sells to the highest bidder to ""help"" while relying on the words of his cousin Iolaus, played by Reece Ritchie, who stirs people, kingdoms and soldiers with his embellishment of Hercules' Labors. Ian McShane nearly steals this movie as the affably comical Amphiaraus, a seer who's visions from the Gods lead this band of merci-men plus one woman Atalanta, an Amazon, played by Ingrid Bols Berdal. John Hurt is well John Hurt and plays the character of Lord Cotys with great finesse. Rufus Sewell barely recognizable as Autolycus a childhood friend of Hercules has always stood with him even in the face of stupidity. Aksel Hennie  as
Tydeus and Joseph Fiennes as Eurystheus are terrificaliy tragic figures. This is a great cast, great writing and Ratner does a great job! The fighting sequences are tight and the story line like this legend is the story of a true Hero, of true Heroes.",1458345600,,1230,4.72093023255814

2489293,2,B000E372ZY,Sorry.  The Rock was cooking an egg with one.  He does great in the light comedy/big muscle movies like GI Joe and Fast and Furious.  But he doesn't seem like a Greek demi god.  Something about the tone of his voice and his behavior--just doesn't have the right presence.  Gerard Butler did it better in the 300.,1457654400,,312,4.4035087719298245

Both are fine entertainment movies, but this version with Dwayne Johnson incorporates a lot of liberties to up the ante over the traditional story.  So if you're fine with the loose interpretation and view this as a hero flick, you'll likely enjoy this.

And honestly, the kids can watch it too if you think you can handle moderate adult situations.  Oh and the was no sappy love story, which was nice because in most movies nowadays love is used as a horrid plot device to progress movies... but not this one, you could say Hercules ex machina.",1457222400,,560,4.254716981132075

But I think this is a great explanation of how all legends of gods are born - either someone's imagination/tales or embellishing something that likely happened on a small scale or normally and then exaggerated beyond belief... or maybe never even happened and it was all fiction. Kinda like stories about Thor or Jesus or Buddha or Krishna or Zeus or ... Hercules

2489765,4,B000E372ZY,It's not Oscar winning but the alternate story line is interestingly exciting.  Some great well known and respected actors and The Rocks performance was good.  He's not only an action hero.,1455062400,,189,5.064516129032258

2489767,2,B000E372ZY,"When I heard that Dwayne Johnson was doing a Hercules movie, I was really looking forward to it -- ""The Rock"" can be a decent actor in the right role, and with modern special effects, the mythical story could be done right.  I've had a love of Greek Mythology since I was a little kid.  Sadly, Johnson, the writer, director and producer decided to make a more ""realistic"" version, claiming that various Hercules ""stories"" were distortions of much more mundane adventures.  In effect, Hercules and his companions are con men who distort his accomplishments to build his reputation for profit.

This movie has pretty good action scenes, but most of the joy I expected from the movie was removed by making it realistic instead of mythical.  I would have rather seen something more like the original Greek Myths.",1455062400,,808,4.826086956521739

2489777,3,B000E372ZY,Hercules (2104) was a typical B movie.  A B movies represent a particular genre  like Greek and Roman stories about Gods and Goddess and their offsprings.  Hercules (2014) follows this tradition. The special effects were very good. The plot was slightly different other Hercules I watched.  While this movie was very predictable I found it relaxing because I didn't have to put a lot of thought into the story line.  I would watch it for free again.,1454976000,,449,4.779220779220779

2490199,5,B000E372ZY,"Greek mythology and comic books were about the only things I would read when I was a kid, and as an adult I still love them.  So when I saw this movie, I was pretty excited.  It's a modern take on the classic, finding the truth in the Hercules story but still being fantastical.  The action scenes are well worth watching for some mindless fun, and for those wanting an engaging story and characters, I think there is enough there for you too.  There is also a nice balance of humor to the serious, and the cast is quite eccentric in a good way.  It's a great movie to sit down and watch on the big screen or to have on in the background on a small screen while doing something else.",1453593600,,683,4.143939393939394

2490361,4,B000E372ZY,"This is quite a good version of the old Hercules tale, this version has Hercules as a mortal man (although still with far fetched strength and the ability to keep going after being mauled and stuff).  Hercules is basically a mercenary for hire who will join anyone in battle, for gold.  He has a pose  of warriors who go everywhere with him including Atalanta, a hot well toned Amazonian warrior (Ingrid Bols Berdal) who not only goes into deadly battles in pretty much a medieval bikini top and short skirt but has even more over the top fighting skills than Hercules, and can dispatch countless enemies with her archery skills.  He also has a cousin who voices Hercules battle action as a loud commentary behind a wall of soldiers and compares what he's doing to myths of battles against lions, serpents and other Greek mythological creatures that he wants the enemy to believe actually happened.

Hercules is a fun sort of tongue in cheek Greek medieval era battle movie that's overall plot is fairly predictable.  It's the type of movie where the main heroes miraculously avoid getting killed by arrows raining from the sky, who can fight multiple people at once and only look like could come to harm when their attacker will be killed from behind and another of the hero group will give them a smile that says, see I got your back.  Dwayne Johnson does a good job as Hercules, and if you get a DVD with extras you can see the wig and makeup transforming him from the bald headed ""The Rock"" into the Greek mythical legend.  Dwayne also talks about how he always wanted to play Hercules and how he got injured in a wrestling stunt show but was determined to recover and make the movie as he knew it got shelved for a year, it probably wouldn't ever be made.  I found the extras to be as interesting as the movie was entertaining.",1452643200,,1832,4.544072948328267

2490379,3,B000E372ZY,"Witty dialog saved this movie.  The interesting thing is that half the movie attempts to debunk the idea of Gods, then gives super powers to an entire squad supporting Hercules. The action is so over the top to ALMOST be comical, but you have no thrill watching the cartoonish action. The Road Runner has more realistic action than this movie. The acting is not exceptional but isn't going to destroy your faith in humanity either. The special effects are top notch. This could have been an awesome movie if it was not so hypocritical. The dialog could have been inspiring if the movie was not done with comic book type action.  Seriously, a guy throwing knives and taking out waves of enemy, a woman shooting multiple arrows hitting multiple targets and killing all instantly. Finally the last feat of Hercules goes against everything the movie tried to build, which completely destroyed the whole suspense of disbelief.  Even the sword fights among mere mortals were poorly choreographed and cartoonish. Luckily I was not disappointed as I had low expectations to start with. The humor in the movie makes it worth watching however.",1450828800,,1133,4.9214659685863875

But as the story developed, we began to appreciate that this was meant to be a more humanistic portrayal of the Hercules legend, leaving out direct actions by the gods.  It climaxed most gratifyingly at the end, where the film gave an alternative to the legend of how, why and by whom Hercules and his family were made to suffer.

2490683,4,B000E372ZY,"Really, this is a 4.5-star movie. For what it is. Which is, a fun movie. What made it a cut above other fun movies, and earned it the extra stars:

- It's not stupid. The movie doesn't assume the audience just wants cheap thrills. Yes, this is a good action movie, but it had something to say about perception, reputation, myth (and our desire to indulge in it) and even, if you think about it, PTSD. That it had anything to say at all was a huge, and welcome, surprise.

- It didn't follow the formula regarding its band of heroes. I won't say anything more about that.

- The female warrior was pretty cool.

- There weren't any unnecessary romances, again bucking the formulaic a bit.

- The formulaic parts worked really well. As someone else said, it has a nice touch of humor, and Hercules' right-hand man (Rufus Sewell) was really fun. I'd be interested in seeing him in other movies.

If you're already interested in seeing this movie, but worried it might be a bit dumb, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Enjoy!",1448150400,,1018,4.505434782608695

It has the right amount of fighting scenes, nothing too debonair (I mean if you're watching a Hercules movie you expect his fighting style to be one worth watching, yeah? A bit over the top but c'mon he's a demi-god.) No floofy main-character-falls-in-love-with-attractive-maiden-I-saw-that-from-a-mile-away kind of scene.

Compared to Game of Thrones (for example), I was anticipating more authenticity regarding some of the character development and aesthetics (i.e. ancient Roman or Greek accents, hygiene (body hair & teeth), and even temperament/mannerisms in some cases.  I was also hoping Johnson would do an unrecognizable transformation into the ""legendary"" Hercules, but to be fair, this movie was not about the legendary character.  Hercules was re-casted to being just a man with hero-like characteristics - essentially ""The Roc""... Despite all of that, I (still) enjoyed the movie.  The cinematography, costumes, and acting was all pretty good.  As touched on before, it portrayed Hercules from a completely different prospective (mortal vs. immortal) and in a different context than mostly all other films and books. I personally found appreciation in the different spin on the mythological character - and occasional comic relief experienced throughout the film as well.",1445904000,,1083,5.455089820359281

I give it 2 stars simply because the casting was excellent. Other than that everything else was terrible. Har har, hes not really the son of Zeus we just made all that up! May as well make a Passion of Christ movie where Jesus isn't the son of god, would be a the same thing. This movie is disrespectful of all things Greek. I would consider buying this piece of trash just so I could burn it and piss on its remains but I don't want to give the illusion that anyone is paying money to own a copy of it. Perhaps if I ever see it in a bargain bin at a flee market ill pick it up for 10 cents.

2496367,5,B000E372ZY,"Simply Awesome. intelligent take on the Legend of Hercules. Try to remember that the story of Hercules was a very very old oral tradition long before it was written. Long before there was writing. For instance, (and not to be a spoiler), part of the mythos the legend of Centaurs...is probably a very old memory (no telling how old), of a time when the art of horse riding was not widely known. People hunted horses for food - not taming and riding. Such would be the memory of any tribe or people who first encounter-----the shocking sight of a man on a horse. It had not been seen or even envisioned by any people for a very long time.before such a meeting.

Similarly, when the Spanish came to conquer the Americas, horse riders were viewed by Native Peoples as a two headed 6 legged monster..or even gods. Here too the Spanish capitalized on that shock, while Native Peoples gradually killed off the Conquestadors And their horses. When that happened the Original Peoples adopted the art of horse riding ---and they too have their ""Horse Legends"". The plains tribes became legendary Horse Warriors and Hunters. The blood lines of the original Spanish horses introduced in the Americas, and bread by the Original People l runs strong to this day in the west and southwest - to this day. And that is a ""True"" legend.

Remember that the tale of Hercules was written down in a time when writing was still novel, ""literate"" people were still very rare, even kings and queens likely could not read or write a word. Aaah scribes. What has come down to us are just scraps and pieces that has somehow survived time. That similarly the oral traditions - the racial memory - were already dimmed by immense time.when they were set to stone and vellum. We are no better than the scribes and historians of that ancient day - we can only catch a glimpse - and mourn what was lost for the telling of even more ancient days.and Not recorded.

In Ancient Greece (cradle of Democracy) many were the families that claimed direct lineage to Hercules. It was these people who commissioned the writing of the Oral story of Hercules. Even that version of the story that has come down to us,(and others like ir) still informs and in part directs our notion of Freedom and Democracy even as it did in days of old.

This is a thoughtful, intelligent, action packed story of Hercules. However it is told, the message is the same, Battle evil, find courage and strength in persistence, strive for better lives for you and your people, battle evil for in the end you choose your fate and like Hercules -become a Hero.

We are a civilized people, our best weapon of choice IS the written word, negotiation, petitions, even your vote.....The pen is mightier than the sword. These days the battles for good are no less fierce than the Labors of Hercules, but the lesson is still the same -for persistence in the face of insurmountable odds, persistence and courage fighting the good fight- Will Prevail. Be a Hero. Vote in this Democracy that was born in the days of Hercules.

The movie shows that strength comes with faith and in the fight for good course.
A little mix and eclectic inclusion of deeds of other mythical heroes (it was Samson, who destroyed the circus, filled by his enemies by destroying pillars), but, anyway, the movie is fascinating. If not for some scenes, which can cause nightmares, would recommend it for teens to encourage them to train rigorously to be able to fight evil.

The characters, including Hercules' had a lot more depth to their personalities and the interaction between Hercules and his team was fun.  I say team because Hercules had a female warrior among his group.  Hercules and his team members individually had depth of character which I think, together gave them the unity of standing strong.  It also made them a family having traveled and fought together for so many years.  The story and characters were different from all of the 'other' Hercules renditions I have seen.  It also had some good action and fight scenes.  Not up to standards of Gladiator w/Russell Crowe or 300, but not bad as a top 5.",1444176000,,690,4.652892561983471

Hercules was actually well made.  It made you think about the legend of Hercules and how it may have been based upon the reality of what Hercules actually did.  There is a nephew portrayed to tell the legend as he would exaggerate to help Hercules win over the masses he was fighting for.  This was a neat perspective for a movie.  It is full of action, feeling, love, tragedy, pathos.  A lot of Dwayne Johnson's movie seem to have this and this is what makes watching his movies enjoyable.

In reality their were some decent large scale action scenes and maneuvering. The only thing that played on the ""part god"" aspect of Hercules was dream type sequences. The ""legend"" part was explained by the braggadocios story telling of Hercules traveling companions and nephew. Hercules was just presented as an exceptional human.

This was just ok, it felt very ""small screen"" type production. Some flaws that I felt were for an army it seemed small and all they were good for was making a wall around the king while Hercules's small team fought an entire army. After taking down two entire armies seemingly single handed only to be caught by their own army of (fresh) basically trained men seemed oddly out of place. And out of nowhere comes Hercules clothing line for armour, helmet & shields, where was the production line to generate such fine quality fighting gear? But, with all the flaws, this movie is riddled with them, I still enjoy watching my MAN!",1442275200,,715,4.5

2498581,4,B000E372ZY,"I really love Greek mythology, heck I even have the Ten Plays by Euripides sitting on my computer desk. The whole time I watched this movie I really thought the title should of been ""A Man Called Hercules."" That is essentially what this movie is about, you get no epic Greek tale just a bastardized version of if Hercules was an average man how would he accomplish these so called ""feats"" and how his legend was embellished to advance him into ""godhood.""
For what its worth it's a pretty enjoyable movie once you get away from that wanting to see a Greek myth feeling. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is such a likable guy in pretty much any movie he's in, and damn those arm veins can just about pop out of your screen; no 3D needed.",1441929600,,728,4.360294117647059

Another nice touch is the lack of any ""gory"" violence and the ""adult"" is kept to the same level as the original ""Clash of the Titans"", with a quick shot of the south side of a naked and north bound Mrs. Hercules.  The supporting cast is fun to watch, with some truly talented actors chewing up the scenery.  Don't think too hard (just like Hamlin in Clash, why is ""The Rock"" is the only one not speaking the Queen's English?), some of the battles are long enough to go let the dog out and still make it back, but all in all good to go.",1441843200,,713,4.182481751824818

The motley collection of heroes seems to be taken from an assortment of Greek myths and legends most of which have very little to do with each other or with Hercules. This assortment of mercenaries more or less led by Hercules is hired to save a country. Saying more would spoil what little suspense there is in the story.

Each and every performance and dialogue was superb; wish all ""epic"" movies could be done like this but most myth/superheroe movies fall teribbly short on the most important elements- the dialoque, acting, moral message, bravery, emotion and drama. This movie hits the mark and then some. A total enjoyment from the very start to the very end. Not a single wasted word or wasted scene in this movie. Everyone of every age should see this film.

I was really surprised at the quality of the sets, the quality of the action and overall very good acting. The plot is good and keeps you interested from beginning to end. It also helped to have Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell as supporting actors to Dwayne Johnson. The movie is more about Hercules as a mercenary fighting for gold but then also for principles than about gods and monsters. I much prefer this version.

The best part of the film is the slow revelation that Hercules is not actually a god and that the world of the film does not feature real gods and monsters. He is just a regular man (though strong).

The Rock is the best part of this film, he comes off as neither cheesy or over-the-top (like the grown man who plays his childish nephew). Nobody important dies, and the ending is happy.",1441324800,,558,4.355769230769231

2498916,4,B000E372ZY,"I liked this more than I probably should have. A general description is a merger between Conan the Barbarian and the Hercules TV series from years back.

There have been many iterations of the Hercules story.  This time he's a jaded mercenary, fighting for cold hard cash with a band of equally profit-minded cohorts.  Hercules' calling card is his renown as the son of Zeus.  But here, even he isn't necessarily 100% sure of his divinity.  It's an effective twist to the Hercules mythos although one that has been used dozens of times in other stories.

Yes, the action scenes are fantastic and the treachery is laid on thick, as you'd expect.

Mostly I enjoyed this because Dwayne Johnson brings an undeniable charisma to the role, and because the predictable plot and characters are executed well.

In short, the movie sets itself on a well-traveled path, and arrives safely at its destination.",1441152000,,897,4.855263157894737

I anticipated a formulaic action flick with updated special effects repeating and renewing fun and campy old movies.  While there were definitely elements of that, this version of Hercules took a surprisingly fresh approach to the myth and I quite enjoyed the movie as a whole.  The only complaint I have, and it's very minor, is that there was a lot of exposition left out in the plot.  It felt like I missed parts, not unlike going to refill popcorn and coming back to wonder what happened and how we got from point A to point Q.

Most of the events recorded in ""Greek Mythology"" are scientifically true by location and person, however the things they have said to have done have been put in metaphors or over glorified.

The visual effects were great, and the acting as well as the action was equally really well done. I really enjoy the Hercules stories and it did a good job of encompassing it from the ancient sources.

I must admit I'm a Dwayne Johnson fan and I could sense the earnest effort he put into this role,but alas for the umpteenth time, the ""Olympian-size"" gravitas the subject requires was once again unrealized. I was pleasantly surprised at director Brett Ratner's job ""behind the camera"" especially in light of his lack of experience directing this genre of film. .Unfortunately this movie  is plagued by a mediocre script,rife with modern-day colloquialisms and expletives,and rather uninspiring pre-battle"" inspirational"" speeches and exhortations. This film's high points, for me at least, occurred within the first ten minutes of it's start and during the last twenty minutes or so of it's conclusion. I did find the very ""non-supernatural"" explanations regarding several mythological creatures very plausible,especially that of centaurs and Hades' Cerberus. I did constantly have to ""check"" my incredulity while viewing,and reminded myself that the film is based on a graphic novel and generally eschews mythical accuracy. I do extend kudos to Ian McShane,Rufus Sewell and Joseph Fiennes whose presence served to elevate the movie's acting,even though the dialogue was often ""wince-producing"".If,by chance,a sequel or even a prequel is being pondered,the first ten and last twenty minutes of Hercules should serve as the production's ""blueprint"".",1440806400,,1396,5.647619047619048

2499298,3,B000E372ZY,"OK. So, I liked this movie but it doesn't have a lot of depth. I'm sure you already figured that out. It's basically a special FX movie...and I liked it. But here's the thing......I fell asleep in the middle and it didn't matter! :-)  It was as if I didn't miss a thing. People were shouting, swords were swinging....monsters roaring....yadda yadda.  So funny. Any way, don't miss the end of the movie it was really good. So, if this is your kind of move then add a star.

Special FX: 5 out 5 - Awesome special FX

I'd say it falls in line with something like the ""Clash of The Titans"" and ""Mummy Movies"".  Decent cast and story.  Special effects aren't too over the top (which is a good thing).  Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson seems to be in his element as the mighty Hercules.  A solid addition to the current Prime streaming library.",1440720000,,416,4.554054054054054

In this rendition he is little better than a naive barbarian scum-bag mercenary, with a band of others that make him more than he is, versus the traditional stand alone hero who stands for something, ..but with the sidekick Eolis.

Always love Dwayne Johnson, but was certainly no Kevin Sorbo in this role.

That aside, it was still fun to watch.",1440547200,,403,4.728571428571429

2500821,4,B000E372ZY,Action with some comic relief.  I liked the realistic approach with Hercules character and enjoyed his nephew's character.  The inter-relationships were well played out among Hercules and his entourage.,1440288000,,202,5.931034482758621
2500822,4,B000E372ZY,We enjoyed this remake of Hercules.  The acting was much more credible and we like the Rock.,1440288000,,92,4.411764705882353
2500823,4,B000E372ZY,"The Rock is great - looks better than ever. I guess I'm a bit of a purist though. They took a few too many liberties with the story of Hercules. I'm afraid there are many people - who don't read the classics, or don't read at all -- that will be taking this for the real story. It is a BIT more believable from a modern-human standpoint, but we can't change the old stories just because we feel like they need to be changed to match the times. That's not why they survived all these many years. But that is Hollywood, I suppose. They've done the same with Noah, and Lincoln, and whomever catches their fancy on a particular day. I just wish they would be a bit more up front with a statement about ""this is fiction/fantasy BASED on the story of x."" I have actually talked to people who take a lot of these movies for true. But back to Hercules - it's pretty good.. enjoyable. Pretty people abound. Lots of fights for those who like that.",1440288000,,937,4.240223463687151

2500977,3,B000E372ZY,"Interesting from the standpoint of the action and a semi-interesting story plot.  Is this Hercules really a demi-god (son of Zeus) or just a really buff muscle man surrounded by myth??  The story tantalizes with the possibilities but is never conclusive.  Either way, he is impossibly strong and whips up on the bad guys in some really whoopee scenes.  His side kicks (comrades) contribute largely to his success in battle and they are no slouchs either.  Lots of action, but the storyline like Hercules' strength sometimes borders on the absurd.  Still, it's entertaining for the guys who like action.  Probably a little gory for the under 12 crowd.",1440288000,,650,4.962962962962963

Dwayne Johnson is a far superior actor even if he has had a few duds himself.  I expected a good cheesy action flick and got a much more realistic (by comparison) epic.  That is another thing that made it good in my book: the fact that there was very little in the way of mysticism and the supernatural.  I could easily say I enjoyed this at least as much as Troy, more than Alexander, and much more than the new Conan movie.  If anything negative is to be said for it, I'd say it left me wishing someone would make a worthy Conan movie (long overdue).",1440115200,,718,4.129496402877698

2502917,3,B000E372ZY,"For some reason, the creators of this movie thought that the myths surrounding the Labors of Hercules were too fantastic for modern audiences to accept so they had them become false PR for Hercules' band of mercenaries.  (The brief scenes depicting the myths are actually the best in the movie.)  In their place, they created what one supposes they thought were more realistic adventures for Hercules.  Unfortunately,  the story of the new Labors is quite predictable; and the supposedly realistic martial skills of Hercules and his companions are beyond believable, at times even ridiculous-- but they are in keeping with modern films' idea of action.  The filmmakers also get an F for their knowledge of Greek history.  Nonetheless, Dwayne Johnson is such a likable presence that, despite the negatives, the movie is enjoyable and well worth a view for those who love action films set in the ancient world.  This film is no worse that the old Steve Reeves movies and certainly more pleasant to look at.",1439856000,,1004,4.976047904191617

2504771,4,B000E372ZY,"Surprisingly intriguing story of deceit and payback, city leaders seeing Hercules as obviously strong but do not believe he is really the son of Zeus.  In this 2014 film, Hercules has a well-trained team having saved each life that stands by him from a former battle.  However, as the story continues, it is up to Hercules to give backing to the legend of his birth, leaving everyone wondering at the end ""it is real or is it Memorex"" a statement well understood by many who watched TV 35 years ago.

The special effects are well done while Dwayne Johnson gives his usual excellent performance.  What I love about these films with Johnson is that you can enjoy them with your kids without the progressive's firing F bombs every five minutes to try to pretend they control the media.  I think that rule might have been broken once in his San Andreas movie, my hoping in the next film Johnson tells his progressive director to stick it.",1439596800,,934,4.602409638554217

2504966,4,B000E372ZY,This movie was very different than any other Hercules movie or tv show that I've seen but great in its own right. The family of brothers(and one sister) that aids Hercules in all of his adventures makes the story more believable in my opinion. The action scenes were well done and exactly what is to be expected in a movie of this genre.  Don't expect amazing acting from this film but you will not be disappointed by the fight scenes.  And the biggest plus that I see is that they have Dwayne Johnson look a hell of a lot like Kevin sorbo from the TV show.

I liked the twist on the original story, but that's about it. I cannot wish the movie had been something else that it wasn't, but I feel like there was a major opportunity missed here. Not sure who's decision it was, but having seen Bretton Ratner's other movies, I'd say it's his magicless touch that did the trick.

The part where one of his trusted sidekicks takes the money a leaves has been done a number of times but an argument can be made for the justification for it. I was relieved when Hercules thru several cathartic adventures was finally able to finally lay to rest the emotional baggage he'd been carrying around since that tragic incident with his family. Did I jump up at the end of the movie and fist pump the air yelling ""Hooray for Hercules""? Not Really!  Did my eyes well up when his personal futurist gave him THE pep talk that allows him to finally become the man he always aspired to be and needed to be or all would be lost. Nope!  But did I enjoy the movie absolutely. Hell, I used to like the Steve Reeves movies when he played Hercules or someone akin to him and they were poorly dubbed.",1439510400,,958,4.401129943502825

I think I watched it twice just because I absolutely love the rock! Even though this storyline was not what I had grown up with, I still really liked it... it's kind of like watching the new remade Disney movies, except better.

2505604,1,B000E372ZY,"I found this movie unwatchable. The plot is hokey, the acting is okay or whatever, I guess... It's hard to praise acting in a film that's so dumb really. The battle scenes... I would be able to praise them if every movie that comes out didn't have ""epic battle scenes!"" (RAWR!) Even the Anchor man movies had well scripted brawls in them, even if they were meant to be 100% comedic. I wouldn't be surprised if they remade the ""Look who's talking"" series with an infant gladiatorial arena segment taking place in a nursery. So are the combat scenes done well? Of course they are. Like the Transformers movies though, a few well done action sequences doesn't save the whole product... which... like this one... is just boring and silly to me.

I see all the high star reviews, and I'm not saying that anyone is wrong in their opinions about the movie, I'm just saying this movie didn't do anything for me.",1439337600,,903,4.539877300613497

2506186,4,B000E372ZY,"There's something about a ""remake"" of older movies that makes me hesitate; some have been quite disappointing, with more emphasis on crazy stunts, or special effects, sometimes overshadowing the story line---or worse, lousy acting.  Well this film did NOT disappoint me.  In fact, it was different from a lot of movies that feature a ""super hero"" (main) character, such as that played by ""The Rock,"" Dwayne Johnson.  He didn't portray an out-of-control, invincible warrior, but more often exercised restraint, recognizing that war leaves deep scars on both sides.  This film moved along quickly, and I found the cinematography more colorful than the drab, almost tawny tones seen in other recent films featuring urban scenes, and scenes with non-stop action (excluding filming in diminished light which naturally reduces visible colors).

Frankly, this movie entertained me on several levels, and I intend to watch it again.  It was well-cast, had little if any gratuitous violence, good CGI (but not overwhelming), and a great surround soundtrack.  Also, for a ""combat"" action film, Hercules (2014) had far less offensive language (thus its PG-13 rating) than the majority of action movies I've seen the last few years.  Dwayne Johnson makes a believable action hero come to life once again!",1439164800,,1292,5.299019607843137
2506187,4,B000E372ZY,"The good, bad and the ugly rides again. This one is not the Clint Eastwood's western but predictable & the ""good"" rides into the sunset.  Yes the ""Rock"" Dewayne Johnson still got it although he is no young spring chicken might I add. He is huge again & trained hard to look the part. O' dang, the miracles of the ""supplements ""!  In my opinion he is a good actor & have always enjoyed his wrestling & acting careers. Yes the misfits of the Greek Gods must lend a helping hand to the oppressed & endure many heartaches as well as headaches. Violent & bloody, not for the little ones or the faint of heart. Many nice special effects with great costumes. If you enjoy Greek Mythology with a different spin to Hercules, then you may like this.",1439164800,,739,4.3478260869565215

2506364,3,B000E372ZY,"I didn't like the direction the story took. I understand it was based off a graphic novel, I guess I wouldn't have liked that either.
SPOILERS!
I'm a big mythology buff, so I didn't like the idea of Hercules being a regular guy who had help from friends and just a reputation of being a demigod. There was that time he said he didn't know his father, where I thought he really was and just didn't know it...but no.
The story had some flaws as well. These might be considered nitpicking, but they play an important part in my review. When Hercules is talking with Autolycus about their take--after battling the pirates--he mentions that they're almost to their goal. But just before that, he let half of them go. He mentions many times in the movie that they are mercenaries and they're in it for the money, so it makes no sense to default on half your potential profits.
I didn't like how crazy strong they made him either. He was knocking guys through walls, pushing over giant statues, pulling giant shackles from stone, and getting bit by huge wolves. Stuff that lots of completely normal men can do, right? The movie was quick to show that Cerberus, hydras, and centaurs weren't real and this really is just a normal world we live in, but then give him strength like that.
So to sum it up, I kept expecting the revelation of him being a demigod after all, but was let down when that never happened.",1438992000,,1402,4.48046875

2506612,4,B000E372ZY,"If they had done this right, there could well have been 12 movies; one for each of the fabled labors.

this much better than I expected it to be, but frankly if they could stretch out the Harry Potter series into a zillion sequels; the classics were already sitting there waiting to be brought to life without any (or minimal) artistic license and fabrication.

Fortunately this production is blessed with a star cast and a fairly decent script.
The production values are excellent.

I am getting tired of the archery thing; the whole Legolas (LOTR) elven archer par excellence, the exquisite Chinese martial arts film ""Hero"" with the ""sky blackened by the Qin armies"" routine. It's not offensive, but it's too obvious and it would have been more interesting to see the Amazon warrior engaging in more swordplay to underscore the legendary prowess of the Amazons.

The opening scenes are breathtakingly brilliant; thus my conclusion that a multitude of sequels could have been realized had the producers not gone for the fast and easy money.

The scary/crazy bug-eyed dude with a very bad case of neoclassic pan Hellenic PTSD is a very amusing and interesting character.
I suppose in those days; pre-Prozac Nation and all that, if you had PTSD, you just went around killing people; which seemed to be a very socially acceptable activity in those times; they certainly seemed to be a really blood thirsty lot back then.

Anyway, I gave it 4 stars just for the benefit of the doubt and it is more than just palatable entertainment, especially given such stellar performances by actors like John Hurt, who can deliver a solidly engaging performance in whatever role he's offered.

The plot is superficially but adequately intelligent; which is a God send, rather than subjecting the audience to a moronic simple minded good vs. evil topped with eye candy beefcake script.",1438819200,,1868,4.929936305732484

It has some great action and good acting and the Rock makes a fine Hercules...but the movie feels much more like a made for TV movie, with a short run time and not a lot of development for characters or story.

I know this is based on a comic series rather than being based primarily in Greek Myth, but it's kind of a let down we get so many movies based loosely on Greek Myth that really have very little Greek Myth involved.
The Labors of Hercules are just exaggerated tales glossed over early on (I'd have loved a movie actually dealing with those!) as is his history.
The gods may or may not be real, but they play very little part in the story other than mentions here and there.

Spoiler alert: This movie basically says that mythology and all of its glorious culture wasn't real, and that it didn't happen the way we all read about. The hydra was just a bunch of bandits wearing costumes. Centaurs are just men on horses that people saw at a weird angle that made them look half man half horse. It's sad. This movie is horrible.

Me: ""Wait, but didn't like 90% of every trailer I saw focus heavily on the fantasy elements, which are incidentally quintessential to the character? And then everything turned out to be a dream or just a simple misperception? What the actual heck?""
Movie: ""No, see, all that myth and legend stuff is totally lame. This is way more realistic and believable!""
Me: ""Believable? But there was literally no resemblance to any kind of actual historical realities at all. The Scorpion King was more accurate to real life events. And then there was the Legolas chick... and the bone... whip... and the CGI... and the... with the... and...""

To have him come to the aid of a place that is devoted to Hera and expect it to work out was more unbelievable than  whether he was a demigod.  In  Medieval Christendom, Heraules is a forerunner of Christ.
Battles were a bit.. fantastic.. and fun.  Wasn't sure if Hercules was African? or Italian? or both?

2506946,4,B000E372ZY,"For the reviews complaining that the Labors of Hercules were over sooner than they would have liked, had they Actually read ANY synopsis previous (say on a site like IMDb) they would have known that a lot of the story takes place AFTER the Labors were performed. Hey, it was publicized but as always, it seems, people see something and think it will be what they expect rather than taking time to do a little extra research. Anyway I thought everyone in the film played their roles well for the storyline given. The film in tone reminded me of the TV series Hercules The Legendary Journeys so if you ever watched that show the film is similar in tone and humor. I also liked how there was an up-in-the-air quality to one story point; watch the film and it becomes obvious. Any nitpicks I have are minor given certain elements in the Hercules myth that is primarily known. Beyond that I definitely liked this take better than the film that preceded this one's release in 2014.",1438646400,,975,4.545454545454546

2506984,3,B000E372ZY,"During the end credits, it was revealed that the characters were based on a comic book.  Had they shown those graphic novel type animations at the beginning of the movie, I think I would have liked Hercules much more than I did.  What I thought were deep flaws in the movie, may have been completely intentional.  For instance, Hercules would wack an enemy with his caveman club and the guy would fly twenty yard through the air.  A scene like that didn't seem to fit in with the overall feel that the director seemed to be going for.. unless you know it's based on a comic..

It was very disconcerting how the movie kept shifting from seriousness to camp.  I also didn't like Dwayne Johnson in this.  I thought he did a pretty awful job in his dramatic scenes, and simply giving him a beard didn't do enough to mask the wild eyed fake-serious wrestling persona underneath.  In the most serious of scenes, I always half expected him to turn to the camera and yell out, 'can you smell what The Rock is cooking!' What does that even mean?!?  But knowing now that it's based on a graphic novel, I would have given the movie more poetic license and I wouldn't really care how dramatically Dwayne Johnson can act.  And did you notice how white everyone's teeth was?  Everyone's teeth were so bright that I thought it was carelessness on the director's part, but again, perhaps even that was part of the artistry of the comic series.  My honest reaction to the movie was 3 stars, but had I seen it with the right mindset I may have given it 4.",1438473600,2,1537,4.430604982206406

There is some violence in the movie so parents should be aware of who's watching the movie.

2507046,5,B000E372ZY,"Was once again scared to rent because of the mixed reviews.  Glad I ignored them and watched the movie anyway.

I think people expected something going into the movie and therefore rated it down because it wasn't what they expected.

I honestly don't understand why people cared SO MUCH that Hercules wasn't doing the Labors.  Would it have been cool to watch him slaying monsters the entire time?  Maybe.  Does that mean the plot of the movie was bad because he wasn't?  Hell no.

Sure the story was predictable at times but it was a good one.  The casting was well done for Hercules as well as the supporting actors and the pacing of the movie was perfect.  There were never long periods of waiting for something exciting to happen.  Some movies like to throw in a ton of action at the start and some like to throw it all in at the end.  Hercules kept it going the whole time.

Well worth seeing at least one time.  Unless for some reason you might die in 2 hours and can only pick one movie.  Then you might make an exception.  Outside of that, give it a go, and don't let the haters or people who have unreasonable expectations turn you off like they almost did me.",1438473600,,1169,4.342592592592593

Acting is poor, fake accents, storyline and script are neither plausible or coherent in respect to Greek mythology.  HBO's worst is better than this.  Dwayne needs to retire somewhere that starts with an ""S"", someplace like Samoa, perhaps.  Ian needs to go back and play some sort of a pirate role for Disney and Ingrid needs to go back to being pretentious as an office clerk instead trying to act as her pretentious self in film.  One extra star for the canned heroic orchestra music and effects.  At least they didn't play Aerosmith or U2 throughout the movie, nor was there shaky camera effects.

2507067,4,B000E372ZY,"So, this movie was a lot better than I thought it would be.  It was FREE on Amazon Prime to boot. Most free movies are of mixed quality, especially the newer ones. But this one was pretty decent considering my lowered expectations.  The movie was probably better than Sam Worthington's version of Perseus.

In this version of Hercules, there is very little shown about the myth. The version presented here shows Hercules as a man of mythic proportions. The concept tries to make it more realistic. The visuals, costume, make up and music are all very high quality. The action sequences are beautiful and epic. The use of slow motion is done well here.

However, the parts that are lacking are that the script and dialogue lack humor and depth. It is pretty standard fare. If you enjoy a B grade popcorn flick, you may like this film.  It has some of the scenery of the Gladiator but the villains are not as scary.  A lot of standard, predictable movie tropes end up being played out.

It's a little predictable but half way decent because of the graphics.",1438387200,,1055,4.579787234042553

The thing I particularly like about this movie is that, although Hercules is portrayed as a hero to commoners, the movie watcher has insight to the true nature of Hercules. He is a mercenary who has gained acclaim as a hero by spreading rumors about himself in an attempt to scare foes into surrender before he even has to fight. The 12 trials are born out of embellished tasks for a mercenary (i.e. the hydra is really a group of bandits who wear snake masks to hide their identity).

This movie doesn't seem to have chosen either to retell the myth or to present Hercules as a mortal. It's a mess. Also it verges toward the overly dramatic pretty often.

The fight scenes really can't be interesting if Hercules and his mortal companions just slay everything using their incredible strength, speed, agility, and spiritual powers. Unfortunately that's pretty much what happens in about 1/3 of the footage.",1438387200,,642,4.935185185185185

It is an okay action flick with very brief moments of greatness. I got the impression that Johnson was putting in real effort to try and bring up the overall caliber. With co-star Ian McShane's character adding a bit of comedic relief, the film rises above 'forgettable' and gets pretty darn close to memorable in a few places.",1438300800,,445,4.373493975903615

2507224,4,B000E372ZY,"I liked it, was a new take on it hard to explain without getting all spoilery.

Some odd characterizations like an Amazon who looks more like a Valkyrie (no tan seriously?) but she's gorgeous and doesn't play a weak female role so that's cool.

Movie also has a few anarchronistic idiocies but luckily they're not very blatant (Oracle/spear-man Hero played awesomely by Al Swearengen has a spear that forks outwards with machinery that's unlikely to have been used and looks kind of dumb/unnecessary).  But at least there's no repeating crossbows firing bolts that split into spiraling death bullets of doom (Hansel & Gretel I'm looking at you).

Performances are fine, the plot is well done (a few things caught my eye and made me wonder but as it turned out they actually made sense in retrospect once certain plot developments became clear/unveiled to the Heroes) and even the odd take they use was left with enough of the mystery left in the old legends to make you wonder.",1438300800,,977,4.7976190476190474

He never talks to the Gods because he really is just a man.

If you take all the cool 'this type' movies from the past and take all the interesting stuff out, you're left with Hercules 2014.  My guess is some studio had a bunch of stuff left over from another movie, Dwayne owed a producer friend a favor, and they tossed this thing together in about 40 days.",1438214400,,506,4.142857142857143

2507297,4,B000E372ZY,"First, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson definitely looks and acts the part.  On the strength of this movie,he would also have portrayed a much better ""Conan the Barbarian"" than Jason Momoa.  I'm not familiar with the original comic book this version of Hercules is based on, but I find this movie an interesting departure from the way the titular character is usually portrayed.  Even though a lot of the creatures Hercules faced may have been ""fictionalized""(considering the context of mythology and ""tall tales""), he's still very much a ultra-competent superhero.  I think Hercules humanity comes across better than most other movies or books that have portrayed him, and ""The Rock"" does an admirable job of bringing this across.  Whereas he was somewhat stiff & stilted in ""The Scorpion King"", Johnson has since improved and it definitely shows in this movie.

Truthfully. both of the ""300"" movies (based on the Frank Miller graphic novel) are more stylish and a bit more graphically violent.  Also, I still prefer the first two Conan movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger as well as the Steve Reeves version of Hercules.  Having said this, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson does the ""sword & sandal"" genre proud and definitely stands head & shoulders above most other movies of this ilk, including the non-entity starring Kevin Lutz.  It was actually the second time I watched this movie, and I don't give movies a second chance if they don't impress me the first time.  This movie proves that one doesn't need a truckload of blood and gore to make a good action/fantasy movie.  I enjoy this movie as a ""one and done"" standalone tale; I wouldn't mind seeing ""The Rock"" reprise this role in a well-plotted sequel or, failing that, take up the helm of Conan.",1438214400,4,1741,4.907849829351536
2507298,4,B000E372ZY,Much better than I expected. Cool action and a simple story with a very small twist. Great mindless fantasy.,1438214400,,108,4.7368421052631575

It is sort of an interesting presentation of a Hercules story. I won't spoil it, but will say Johnson's Hecules offers a more grounded take on the legend.",1438214400,,325,4.701754385964913

2507375,4,B000E372ZY,"I only gave this 4 stars because the negative reviews tend to get buried. It's actually only worth a half a star.

Due to misleading ""trailers"", I watched this farce under the impression that this was a tale of the ""12 labors of Hercules""... hoping it might fall somewhere between ""300"" (original, not sequel ) and ""Clash of the Titans"" (original, not reboot)....wrong on all accounts.
This dog has fleas... and watching a dog covered with fleas scratching himself would be more satisfying. This ""retelling""/""reboot""... since that is the current Hollywood vernacular for plagiarism and the recycling of tired ideas culture was trying to forget... paints Hercules as some nice guy mercenary leading a ""mtley band of ragtag misfits""... that covers every clichd cookie archetype... caught up in the publics' popular perception; but all he really want is a quiet life as a farmer. However,  this being The Rock, when push comes to shove he shows no hesitation to rise to the call, and kill half the opposition single handedly.

Don't watch this; instead watch something more meaningful,  like Scooby-Doo reruns.",1438214400,,1107,5.099447513812155

The attempts to make mythical beasts look impressively real was not overdone like in some of the other movies in this genre over the past few years.  The dialogue in this movie, and the casting, was also better than several similar movies from the recent past as well.  Keep your expectations realistic and you probably will not be let down watching this.  The fact it was free with Amazon Prime was an added bonus, but I would have also been fine spending $1.61 to rent it from one of the local boxes.",1438214400,,679,4.435483870967742

Dwayne Johnson was a good pick as he besides having the physical presence does have the amount of acting ability to portray the hero. This movie is action packed with good characters. I would be interested in the before and after adventures.  No amount of reality in this legend so why pretend there needs to be any.

2507497,4,B000E372ZY,"There has been a seemingly infinite number of Hercules movies in the past, uniformly worthless as far as I can recall, and I didn't expect any more of this movie than to watch it for a few minutes and then watch something else.  However, I found myself watching it through to the end, and think it is not only the best Hercules movie ever made, but perhaps (off the top of my head, without researching it a lot) the best mythologically-based movie ever made in English.

What follows has some semi-spoilers, so if you actually intend to watch the movie, you might want to stop here.

What makes it the best is not the acting, which is okay but doesn't live up the the generally very-high caliber of some of the actors involved, nor the special effects, which are certainly good enough, but that the movie is not mythological at all.  No gods and goddesses or mythological creatures appear.  Yes, there's a story that Hercules is the son of Zeus, but he doesn't seem to believe it personally.  Yes, he has done the ""twelve labors"", but as he keeps saying, they are greatly exaggerated.  Yes, he is immensely, amazingly strong, but not of godlike proportions.  He and his companions seem to think that he is merely a very strong human being, although at times they are so taken aback that they clearly wonder; mostly, they seem to think that they are just mercenaries about whom tall-tales have been spread.  This seems to me to a novel enough idea to carry the movie.",1438214400,,1466,4.564885496183206

He was buff, but otherwise didn't seem to have the gravitas to portray Hercules in a believable way. He looked more like Conan the Barbarian with Jesus hair (but sloppier and greasy looking) . Other casting decisions probably needed to be revisited as well. The costumes looked like they were purchased at the dollar store. For example, Hercules' breast plate did not even contour his body, e.g. tiny pecks on a cheap looking breast plate. Finally, the question of whether or not Hercules was man or half god, was clumsily portrayed. There was a desire to portray Hercules with freakish superhuman strength, but at the same time he would start bleeding with the slightest scratch. I found the portrayal of ""he's a demi-god... kind of / sort of"" to be a little quirky.",1438214400,,907,4.934640522875817

This could be another movie Dwayne Johnson has done throughout his career, with any other title.

You can easily dismiss each member of his dispiriting band of men (and woman) as hackneyed token archetypes. Johnson is the reluctant antihero with the heart of gold, whose moral ambiguity and human imperfections veer toward the path of holy righteousness in about 30 seconds. We can't leave out the wisecracking senior with the ""take it or leave it"" attitude towards death, because you know, he's been there, done that. The token female warrior with the character depth of a paper plate and the annoying sidekick who allegedly proves he is not the weakest link by offing ONE guy in the last 15 minutes of the movie round out the team.

This was not a famous Hercules legend movie, but a movie after the legend with more realistic human touch with band of courageous friends or companies. Very enjoyable great entertainment movie. I loved this movie with truly realistic battle scenes and nice, beautiful exotic sceneries. (I don't know where this movie was located. Is this true Greece?) Hercules' friends also helped this movie very enjoyable. Visual effects of battle scenes were amazing and very realistic. Major characters were also played well.

2507608,3,B000E372ZY,"While I found this to be a moderately entertaining movie and useful for killing some time, by no means did I think it was a good or great movie.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, the premise appears to be the man behind the legend.  Unlike many other reviewers, however, I cannot agree that this is supposed to be a more ""realistic"" version of the legend of Hercules.  First, by the protagonist's own admission, his father is an unknown.  Second, the feats of superhuman strength Hercules performs on multiple occasions over the course of the film defy both human limitations and the laws of physics.  Whether or not Hercules is the son of Zeus is left to the viewer's interpretation of these fantastical acts.  The ""big twist"" is pathetically obvious, and the ending felt rushed.  On a positive note, I can say with certainty that this is the best performance I have ever seen from Dwayne Johnson.  The other characters, while shallow and underdeveloped, are generally likable.  I won't say this movie isn't worth seeing, its just not worth going out of your way to see.",1438041600,,1078,4.752688172043011

dull, weak, fighting.

Truth is I wasn't too impressed.... it had the same characteristics of movies I have seen before, in other words, it was pretty predictable. The dark melodramatic feel is overrated and in this case overdone, The Hercules that came out earlier this year was a little more fun only because of the special 300 effects they applied to their film, and the guy playing Hercules was way better looking, sorry Dwayne, no offense!!. I think this movie could of stood out more if they included more of the God's in this film and displayed there abilities as well, the could of introduced Pegasus which would of made the movie more interesting and they could of included more mythical characters like medusa and the minatore, I know they wanted a more realistic feel to the movie but by going this route they took away the most interesting aspects of his legacy. That's like taking away the Joker, robin and jim gordan away from a batman storyline, it just doesn't work properly.  o well that's my take on this film hopefully one day someone will do this better",1437868800,,1283,4.530172413793103

Johnson plays the titular Hercules, a legend in the making.  The film follows a particular exploit in his legendary journeys that seems sure to doom him and his band of merry men (if that remark reminds you of Robin Hood then good, you've been warned that Herc has a band of merry men who help create and aggrandize his legend).  In the end does he really discover that he is a demigod after all?  Watch and see.

Or don't.  If you like action/ adventure flicks with large pitched battles you might come out of this going ""okay, not great but not that bad"".  If you want more fantasy and more of the Rock's charisma you're going to be a bit disappointed.

2507712,5,B000E372ZY,"After a certain age, certain movies just don't have the same appeal. You know, when you're 21 and seeing a movie on opening night is just what you do, or ordering tickets in advance "" just in case"" (in case of what, i don't know, but we rationalized). One you hit 30 you only do it for special movies, but i gotta say, mid 30's and up, you're like "" omg, cant wait to see it"" and when you do, its always on video (so aging myself saying video) because getting to a movie theater has too many variables to actually execute. Well i watched this in the comfort of my own home, playing hooky from work, laying around with some wine and cheese ( yep, wine and cheese!) I have to say, didn't expect much, i mean, The Rock?? Great to look at, a somewhat entertaining actor, but i thought, this role may be too big for him. Well, very well done, Mr Ratner, Mr Johnson! This was just such a fun movie. It didn't play out too seriously and diverted a bit from the legend that we knew to make it more plausible ( as much as could be) with the right amount of humor, action, story telling, cinematography and graphics  that just made this a great movie. I'm using the word great loosely here, because you have to somewhat realize what you're getting into before watching it. I did see the other Hercules with Kellen Lutz and while that was not on the Pompeii oh-my-god-so-bad level, it was not great...like really not great, mostly because of Kellen Lutz. Just bad casting. But this cast was fun, they had chemistry, and again, this was just a man realizing his potential and eventually living up to it. Go into this with low expectations and you will be greatly pleased.",1429228800,,1659,4.351612903225806

2507830,4,B000E372ZY,"Okay, as a old guy who grew up watching Steve Reeve's version of Hercules from the 1960s, I was never moved much by later renditions of the hero; even the Marvel comic's Hercules was modeled on that version. But.....Dwayne Johnson does a great job in this role, and is entirely believable as the hero. While the slant of the movie is different from other versions, including the Kevin Sorbo tv series, I was very surprised by the film. By the movie's end, it's fairly apparent that you are watching the Hercules. This Hercules is, at least, a good basis for the legend that books and legends are based on, and as such, is more believable than a lot of other versions. Would I watch a sequel? Yes. Especially if it has as much action as the first one. It's an entertaining film, and its well done, with just enough humor and drama to make it work. I think the big problem for the film was the timing of its release, as a different Herc film came out just before this one, and did awful box office. So this film, had a hard slog toward success, but should do well on dvd and cable.",1425254400,,1079,4.320197044334975

2507846,5,B000E372ZY,"This is a much better film than most of the movie critics rated it to be. It takes the myth of Hercules and grounds it in reality. Dwayne Johnson once again proves that he has flashes of depth in his acting that a lot of action movie stars do not, and he leads a very nice ensemble cast of characters. While Johnson and Ian McShane get to go a bit further with their characters than the rest, all are very good. And the main point of a movie like this is the action, which there is plenty of. But what a lot of the critics overlooked was the message the movie makes about heroes, how heroes are created, how they are perceived, and the potential in anyone to be one. This is an action sword and sandal that goes a little bit deeper. It is a fuller story than the old Steve Reeves movies. And, in a way, reminded me of the original ""Magnificent Seven"".
On the technical side, the costumes and sets are beautiful, and the battle scenes are very well staged. The script has a few twists,but nothing that is overly surprising. But I found it a very enjoyable film, and so am writing one of the very few reviews I have written on Amazon.
Would love to see this cast reunite for a sequel.",1424995200,4,1182,4.211453744493392

2507870,4,B000E372ZY,"Incredible action, fabulous acting, and an interesting take on the character of Hercules are tainted by bad writing, which produces this year's biggest mediocrity worth watching.  Corny dialogue and infuriatingly stupid Braveheart speeches.  Armies that follow whoever is leading them like poor A.I. in a video game.  Unexplained and unlikely visions of centaurs.  Stuff like that interjects itself as soon as you you get comfortable with the film.  But these annoyances cannot ruin the host of fun action scenes, funny interactions between the heroes, and reasonable plot twists.

Basically, Hercules' team is an ancient version of the Avengers.  Each member has an incredible skill set, a unique personality, and an interesting (if vague) backstory.  They roam around righting wrongs for coin, exterminating and exposing ""monsters"" and various bad guys.  All the while propagating the legend of Hercules, the son of a god.  Using this legend to bring in more coin and make their battles easier is ingenious and often funny.

Hercules (the movie) reveals THREE phenomenal actors who need a lot more screen time: Ingrid Bols Berdal, Aksel Hennie, and Reece Ritchie!  These three SHINE alongside greats like Ian McShane and Joseph Fiennes.  Ingrid is the most believable, beautiful Amazon warrior I have seen in film.  Tough, articulate, expressive, and an action star.  Hennie says more with his facial expressions than the Rock said the entire movie.  And he can bring it in a fight like a mad viking on crack.  Really nice.  Ritchie is charismatic and believable, complimenting his costars perfectly.  I was really impressed by these three.  You never expect a movie like this to contain such high quality performances!

Speaking of acting, the Rock is at his best in this movie.  Still kind of stiff and unbelievable, he has trouble showing emotion on film, but he did very well.

So, while I cannot say you should buy this, I CAN DEFINITELY say you gotta see this.  If you love action, fantasy, or mythology, this film delivers.  Again, if you liked the Avengers, you'll like Hercules.",1424390400,,2089,5.109467455621302

2507872,4,B000E372ZY,"HERCULES

As a fan of the Rock and of this legend in particular I was all about this flick. This film was released around the same time as the other one called The Legend of Hercules so I had to check them both out. Now as I am sure others have pointed out this is not the Hercules you all know. This film is not really about the myths although they are touched upon. This is a more realistic take on the man with new things added but it is an entertaining movie.

Here Hercules leads a band of mercenaries who are hired by a man who wants to see his enemies crushed. So Hercules and his crew go out onto their mission and many a battle ensues. But things are not all of what they seem. Friends become enemies and vice versa as the myth become legend. I have to say that I liked the way the mythical things were used and explained as the film went along. It was a cool new take on Hercules that while not perfect was an entertaining watch.

The acting was really good here particularly that of Hercules and gang as the actors all had great chemistry with one another. Of course Dwayne Johnson was perfect for his role but I don't think this film would have been half as good without the supporting cast they got for his click in the flick.

Director Brett Ratner who is probably best known for the Rush Hour films I think did a good job with this flick that was based on a graphic novel. The action is excellent here with some really cool battles and fight scenes. Like I said this is a more realistic Hercules film so expect the battles to be so, although of course there are still some over the top moments.

This was a good movie and while I did like it I still think I like it just about as much as the other one. it may be because this film was marketed as following the myth and legend so I went in expecting something else. Still its a good movie and the Blu-Ray comes with some great special features. You get behind the scenes stuff, deleted scenes and a great commentary. Also did I mention the ladies in this film are great, especially the merc.",1424304000,,2056,4.181818181818182

2507943,1,B000E372ZY,this movie destroys the original idea of Hercules and that is what watching Hercules movies attracted people.,1422057600,,109,5.470588235294118
2507944,4,B000E372ZY,"I wasn't extremely excited about the refresh to the original story, but the movie as a whole was good. Solid acting, impressive cinematics, and when you think about it, the direction they went with revamping Heracles's origin fits nicely with the recurring theme of deception and politics associated with the historical era as a whole.",1422057600,,335,5.109090909090909
2507945,2,B000E372ZY,"The movie isn't all bad. You get to see Hercules fight all the mythological critters he is supposed to have beaten. You see the birth and origin as told in the legends.
The problem is that the movie goes out of it's way to give a logical explanation as to why the mythical parts of the story became legend; for instance, what was thought to be a multi headed hydra was actually men in disguise. There's nothing wrong with that, I guess. Maybe there are some people in the real who believe Hercules actually existed, who need a logical explanation for the fantastical parts of his legend. Fair enough, I suppose.
Unfortunately the whole point is lost because Hercules still does things that, unless your name was Samson and the power of God was upon you, were not only  beyond the abilities of an ordinary human but definitely reached demi-god status. Not to mention the fact that the statue of the goddess who supposedly never existed, plays a pivotal part in the outcome. Clearly this was meant for irony but along with the seer's ability to see the future, you still get the vibe that maybe the gods of mythology actually were instrumental in shaping the legends of Hercules' life.
Personally I was turned off by the attempt to remove the mythological aspects of the story, but if you are going to go that way, at least be consistent.",1422057600,,1336,4.589958158995816

2507951,3,B000E372ZY,"Happily, the disarming script doesn't take its theme, mythical background and central character too seriously, and--ironically--that casual ""hey, he's just a guy"" attitude helps us take this movie much more seriously than we otherwise would; funny how that works!  It's ""epic"" without the pretense.

Johnson looks the part (no kidding) and based on stories about his preparation for the picture, hats off to him...he knew what it took and he went out and did it.  He's a passably good actor--and not at all like the wooden Steve Reeves of yesteryear (I can hear anyone under 30--the target market here--asking, ""Who?"")  At least two very legitimate ""name"" performers--John Hurt and Joseph Fiennes--get an opportunity to overact and do so with gusto, especially Fiennes as the treacherous King of Athens. More good fun.

The film's most obvious weakness is its failure to incorporate Rheseus in the story much past his defeat and imprisonment. ""Hey, what's happened to him?"" I wondered. I had to look hard to find him.

The picture looks great; the effects and visuals are quite stunning. Even better, it moves well. Two scenes are standouts; the major battle between King Cotyes' army and the forces of the usurper, Rheseus. Whoever was responsible for the scenes of massed military manoeuvers did a great job. I haven't seen this calibrer of hand-to-hand since Braveheart.  The second notable scene--happily--is the very satisfying climax; shades of the old Cecil B. Demille Sampson and Delilah--much more believable, of course. There's some real artistry going on behind the tech tools here, and that's the big difference.  So, yeah--surprisingly--three stars!",1421884800,,1662,5.268939393939394

I do enjoy Dwayne Johnson, especially when he is sporting hair, and outside of having rented this, it was the only reason I kept going.  SPOILER... To remove the mythology from the myth and turn it into some kind of realistic morality play just proved more upsetting than anything else.  The director really needed to step back and let the actors go for it, as much of their acting was stilted and had very little to do with the blah dialogue.  This may have looked good on paper but something went terribly wrong in the translation.  Don't bother unless you truly have nothing else to do.

It's how the plot unfolds and what happens in the movie that make it a great movie or a flop.  It's for this reason that the twists and turns that the movie took to reach the final climax was refreshing.  The characters were developed just enough to make them plausible.  The reason for the many quests that Hercules embarqs upon (money and fame) ring true to someone who may have really existed.  It had some ""same old stuff"" twists like his friend coming back to deliver the daring blow to save the boy-king and start the melee, but these were forgiveable when taken all in as a whole.

2508088,4,B000E372ZY,"Dwayne Johnson plays Hercules in an action-packed film directed by Brett Ratner of Rush Hour fame. Well, I wrote Hercules because  (possible spoiler)  it is not exactly that Johnson plays Hercules, one of the most famous characters in the mythology; he plays a mercenary who claims that he is Hercules, leading a group of seasoned soldiers.

So is he really the Greek demigod? Watch the film and you decide. The point is, based on the comic series by Steve Moore, the new film is an attempt to present a more humanized Hercules in an entertaining way.

And the story is something like this. After the rescue mission of his nephew, Hercules and his band are hired by Lord Cotys (John Hurt), who wants him to train the ordinary citizens for the possible war. Of course, the task turns out more difficult than Hercules expected. Well, the story is a typical one. Not bad, not great.

Now, if you want Hercules from the myths, maybe you shouldnt watch this one. If you want an enjoyable popcorn movie with big-budget action set-pieces and charismatic Dwayne Johnson impressive as the titular hero, this is for you.",1420070400,,1110,4.730569948186528

Perhaps because the cast was well above the B movie level and the script and story lines were enhanced rather than detracted by the special effects. The result was an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. Dwayne Johnson shows he can match his star power with the likes of well seasoned actors such as Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, and John Hurt. The humor was an added spice and the pacing was dead on, for the most part. Top notch stunt work, well coached secondary actors and extras and believable settings fleshed out the story in and unexpected and compelling way. Humanizing Hercules and yet honoring the myth puts this version of the famous tale well above the host of other comic book cardboard versions of Hercules that came before.
Ian McShane was particularly delicious in his running commentary and sardonic humor. Good flick.",1419897600,,950,4.906832298136646

2508127,2,B000E372ZY,"It would be convenient to pin the disappointments on the director (Brett Ratner), but the direction was not the issue and was actually remarkable considering the unexciting story. Any episode of Xena: Warrior Princess is more interesting than this movie; it performed more like a high budget TV series but with obviously no hope of revealing anything else in the world created. The production was near Gladiator proportions and quality but the story was barely a dribble of the same recipe. There is absolutely no romance evident or implied, no goosebumps moments, and 80s era combat routines. The most thrilling moments were all shown in the trailer and are minimized by the ""Hercules was actually just a dude"" theme that beats you over the head throughout. Embarrassment for the cast participating was the only strong emotion felt aside from boredom. Though a better story could have utilized the cast effectively, the entire lot of them would be well suited for a Sons of Anarchy spin off series. While it would have been completely bonkers and unfounded, the addition of motorcycles would have improved the experience of the film at least 1 and a half stars.",1419811200,,1162,4.964102564102564

2508182,4,B000E372ZY,"Like some people have said I too wasn't expecting much from this movie and was pleasantly surprised to find it is quite entertaining, its not the greatest epic ever made but its good fun all the way, the story is pretty simple and straight forward to get into, Hercules is a legendary character in history who has tales of him being that he is half human half god the son of Zeus and has defeated creatures and undergone impossible trials, he takes these stories with him as he and his mercenary friends dispatch of enemies for gold, his name and legendary stature lead him into a trap and betrayal, the story plays out well with plenty of action and fight scenes with Dwayne flexing his shiny muscles like he does best! The movie does have a touch of humour to it which is not necessary but is not too over the top, the cast is pretty good and Dwayne of course plays a perfect lead, the effects are good too, its a tad cheesy in places of course but no matter its a big dumb yet fun movie that's easy to watch, worth going back to a couple of times I think, so check it out especially if your a big Dwayne (the rock) Johnson fan!",1419379200,,1130,4.236111111111111

2508190,3,B000E372ZY,"I've always been fond of the story of Hercules, the son of Zeus and a human woman.  In search of the  quintessential version, I decided to check out this newest movie, directed by Brett Ratner (""X-Men: The Last Stand"").  The main draw is Dwayne Johnson, who seems perfect for the role, especially in his bulked up state in this film.  He doesn't disappoint although the film is a paint-by-numbers affair.

I knew what I was going to get going in and that's what I got, although I thought the final scenes were actually pretty well done.  The film opens with sort of a backstory about how Herc had to perform 12 dangerous missions insisted upon by Zeus's wife Hera as payback for hubby's affair.  Most of these are shown in part in the numerous trailers that preceded the film's release in the summer of '14.

Over the years Herc grew into a family man and warrior, serving King Eurystheus (Joseph Fiennes having a good time).  One night Hercules awakens to find his wife and children slain.  He has no memory of what happened but is presumed to have committed the killings and is banished from the kingdom.  As the years pass, Hercules assembles a nefarious cast of associates played by Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, Aksel Hennie, Reece Ritchie and Ingrid Boso Berdal.  The later plays Atalanta, a short in stature and skirt Amazon archer.  This band of mercenaries are asked by Lord Cotys (John Hurt) to help him defeat an army of baddies led by Rhesus (Tobias Santelmann).  But all is not what it appears to be.

The film runs its course with bits of humor, bits of Ms. Boso Berhal, and bits of dislodged PG-13 body parts.  In short, the film is what you would expect with perhaps a hint of credibility due to the casting.  Still, don't look for any Oscars.

If there are awards due, it should go to the look and feel of the Blu ray transfer.  It's a doozy.  The video is 1080p resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  In a word it looks spectacular.  Robust colors, excellent detail shows off the fine work of the film's craftsmen (armor, shields, makeup, and clothing).  There are no abnormalities or defects in the picture.  Likewise the killer DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 (hello!) soundtrack really stands out.  The sound effects which range from stampeding horses and chariots to swamp creatures are mixed to perfection.  The perfect musical score resonates throughout the speakers.  The dialog is clear and perfectly placed.  This is demo quality stuff.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French and Spanish.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: 2014 seems to be saturated with sword and sandal films, and most of them are about Hercules himself for some reason. I was mildly (emphasis on the world mildly) entertained by The Legend of Hercules, but was really intrigued when I saw that The Rock was planning his own whirl at the famous demigod. Who else besides the Rock could play him well? As Hercules he is supposed to be a man of gigantic proportions and with incredible charisma. Check box one, and check box two seem to be complete, and with the trailer showing Hercules crushing a giant house sized boar with an oversized club, I was immediately in line for tickets to the cinema. Ironically much of whats in the film is ALL in first 10 minutes of the film, with the rest of the 88 minute runtime dealing with a completely different plot device.

Derived from the graphic novel, The Thracian Wars, the tale is about Hercules and his band of mercenary misfits taking on a mission to get the Thracian people up to speed against a legendary enemy. This band of misfits includes older and wiser soldier/prophet Amphiaraus [Ian McShane], Amazonian warrior Atalanta [Ingrid Berdal], Smart mouthed swordsman Autolycus [Rufus Sewell], mute savage Tydeus [Aksel Hennie], and of course the man with the gift of gab, Hercules younger nephew Iolaus [Reece Ritchi]. Set after Hercules has concluded his 12 trials, and after the death of his wife and son, the motley crew are taking money from the highest bidder, and unfortunately for them, this bidder turns out to be more than they bargained for. Originally just a simple job of training the Thracian military to fight against a ruthless enemy, the game changes quickly as friend becomes foe, and the enemy is not who they appear to be. Hercules has to not only defeat this legendary enemy, but the demons haunting his soul over the death of his wife and child, transforming him from a man behind the legend, into the legend itself.

Hercules runs a fine line with the demigod attribute of the legend, making it seem like Hercules is just a man at times. A man with incredible power and utilising trickery to puff himself up in to a legend of overblown proportions. Then you look at some of the moves he pulls off and Brett Ratner teases with the idea that maybe Hercules really IS born of godhood? Even at the very end that carrot is still dangling in front of the viewer, having them double check the film to see just where that turning point is where you actually know if he is or not. At first I was a bit frustrated by it, but as the story goes on it really allows the viewer to decide for themselves whether he has some supernatural power or not. It never comes out and tells you, but gives you just enough to make the decision for yourself, and have neither sides opinion be wrong.

Now the plotline itself is nothing new, its your classic double cross tale set in ancient Greece. Nothing new is there and nothing new is taken away, as you're really there for only one thing. To see Hercules smash things with a huge club and that we have in spades. The action sequences are quick and neatly paced, with much less quick cuts than I would have expected in this era of film making. The sidekicks are just as fun as Hercules himself, as Ian McShane subtly adds some dry humour to the story and Rufus Sewells smart mouthed warrior comes off as a lot of fun. The rest of the cast is fairly throwaway in nature, but John Hurt is so deliciously evil and sociopathic that you just cant wait until he has his much due comeuppance.

For some strange reason, the huge bushy beard The Rock was sporting kind of weird me out. It wasn't so much that he HAD facial hair, as Ive seen it before, but the full bushy beard was kind of strange on his face. I guess they wanted to differentiate from the Rock of old and give him a new look for a period piece. Interestingly enough Hes actually looking BIGGER than he did in Fast & Furious 6, where he was covered up in armour most of the time, and he literally towers head and shoulders over all the other actors, giving him a very herculean look. I was a bit disappointed by the I AM HERCULES yell, being that all the producers, directors and Dwayne Johnson himself had hyped up how legendary it was, but I have to say, the only reason you're going to be seeing this film is to watch The Rock smash things with a club and don't worry, you won't be at all disappointed.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Hercules 3D comes to us from Paramount Pictured with a fantastic 2.40:1 aspect ratio and awesome 1080p 3D encoded transfer. Colours lean towards very earthy browns and has that golden colour grading to it, giving the film a very period piece feel and texture to it. Still there are plenty of other colours to go around, from the green of the savage village peoples body paint, to the elaborate burnished reds of the Thracian army uniforms and the whites and purples of the royal robes. Detail is fantastic as you can see every crease and wrinkle on John Hurts face and even the stretch marks on the Rocks (I still cant call him Dwayne Johnson, in my mind hes still The Rock) upper shoulders and neck from his massive muscle gain over the years. Contrast is very nice, and never boosted or lacking in any scenes, and the black levels are nice and inky. I looked and couldn't notice any compression artefacts at all, whether it be simple macro blocking or digital manipulation by the studios. Except for some very minor soft spots in a couple of scenes, this entire transfer is reference from beginning to end. The 3D presentation is a very awesome pleasing experience for a converted 3D image, and did not much dimmer the presentation even with the addition of the 3D glasses. The foreground shows a lot of layering, with multiple layers going back to the background in descending sequence. Strangely enough the foreground characters look a little flat and 2 dimensional, even though they are popped straight into the viewers eyes at most times. What really stands out here is the inanimate objects that are turned 3D. The dust and debris kicked up from the battlefield looks awe inspiring and as it adds a huge layer of depth to the picture, and the weapons have some awesome pop out moments. Sadly some of the character actors themselves had shown a bit more three dimensionality acting ability, I would have given the film a bit more oomph, but with the 3D image, it helps makes the film more enjoyable.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  It was announced that Hercules 3D would come with a Dolby Atmos track via the original press release from Paramount Pictures, but it has arrived with a new press release that it is a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, and that is what we have on this Blu-ray disc. But Paramount Pictures has announced that Dolby Atmos will be coming out for other Blu-ray releases, but this one wasn't able to have it on the disc for an undisclosed reason. Still, for those of you who aren't banking on Dolby Atmos this is one incredible surround track, filled with raw throbbing power and kind of aggressive nature youve come to love with an action track. The surrounds blend seamlessly with the front sound stage, giving a 360 degree field of immersion makes the sound nerd in me giggle with pure joy. The dialogue is never drowned out by the aggressive sound mix, but comes through with crystal clarity, and is right there in the front row, pounding away mercilessly. Its never that overpowering, but its blended in with the track so seamlessly that there is no room for complain. Its a top notch sound track and despite the exclusion of Dolby Atmos that we may have been waiting for, it is not going to disappoint you one bit.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Only available on the 2D Blu-ray Extra disc.

Special Feature: An Introduction by Brett Ratner and Dwayne Johnson [1080p] [5:32] The director and actor discuss their long-time passion for the character, also Dwayne Johnson's injury and the resultant threat to the film, and pushing forward with the project.

Special Feature: Hercules and his Mercenaries [1080p] [11:07] A deeper look into several main characters and the actors who performed them. Also examined is the costuming and makeup, physical preparations, riding chariots, and the sense of family amongst the crew.

Special Feature: Weapons! [1080p] [5:24] Here we get a closer look at the weapons the main characters wield in the film.

Special Feature: The Bessi Battle [1080p] [11:54] This supplement gives the viewer a closer look into making one of the film's major action sequences, including shooting locales, makeup, actor preparation, and fight choreography.

Special Feature: The Effects of Hercules [1080p] [12:28] A look at the blend of practical and digital effects in the film, including digital landscapes and computerised arrows.

Finally, I had a brilliant fun time with Hercules 3D as it was leagues better than the poor pathetic Legend of Hercules and the Rock never fails to deliver when hes in full action mode. I mean, who doesnt want to see a highly muscular 6 6 character smash things with his bare hands or a club the size of most small trees? Its pure popcorn entertainment at the core and revels in the knowledge that it doesnt try to be more than it is. Theres lots of action, and John Hurt is magnificent at playing a creep of a villain. The audio and video will make home theatre buffs drool, so I definitely give it my recommendation for a watch if you can enjoy a nice check your brain at the door popcorn film. Highly Recommended!

Why was the 3-headed dog guarding Hades hunting Hercules? What really happened to his wife and children?  How did he accomplish his twelve golden tasks from his step-mother Hera the goddess to re-earn her favor?  So many questions to be answered and only 2-hours to do so.  I went in to see it with the hope of seeing Zeus and the other Gods.  Silly mortal was I.

Hint: The movie does explain all to its audiences, and does so very well, neither confirming the Gods or dispelling them; leaving that up to you to choose.  The movie did so well, in fact, it earned  a sixth star if it were mine to give.  Dwayne did real acting in this one, not just eye-candy.",1418688000,18,788,4.263513513513513

Much better then that crappy Noah or Exodus movies that don't even follow the Bible in anyway. But away from my rant on how s***y Hollywood has gotten.

2508302,3,B000E372ZY,"I actually enjoyed this film, much to my surprise, and the key to the enjoyment is to let it flow over you and not take it too seriously.
In places it is more `Monty Python` than Classic Mythology, for example it is strange how in ancient Thebes, most of the characters seem to speak with South London accents! John Hurt and Ian McShane seem to be `Avin, a larf`, and not taking the thing at all seriously, which is fun to watch. In a scene that we have all seen a million times before, and straight out of `The Magnificent Seven` Hurcules faced with an army of useless peasants that need whipping into shape, say`s, ""We will train them to become Warriors!""  to which Ian McShane replies, ""Oh, S***!"" (my feelings exactly).
The CGI is all over the place, the three headed dog Cerebus, done really well, and very cleverly explained, while the Nemean Lion is a enormous monster, but when Hercules has finished it off he uses it as headgear, did it shrink in the wash! But then again it could all have been an illusion.

2508307,4,B000E372ZY,"He is one of the most well known heroes in mythology, as well as in the history of pop culture. He is half man, half god, and all heart. When we hear the name Hercules, we think of the monsters, the challenges, the tragedies and the strength. So, does this latest film featuring the demi-god do him justice, or is it another misstep in the history books?

With action mega-star Dwayne The Rock Johnson taking up the mantle, you would think this movie would be in good hands. If you thought this, then you thought right. The film is actually based on the comic book Hercules, published by Radical Comics, and features a more intense, albeit different look at the legendary hero.

Directed by Brett Ratner, the film takes a very different look at the legend of Hercules. We see glimpses of the legendary 12 labors, as well as some of his more iconic foes, but from a different perspective, which I think works extremely well. Johnson fits the bill perfectly for Hercules, as the massive strongman can not only fight like nobodys business, but he can act as well. The story puts the hero in a situation to help a kingdom ward off a warlord. The story, though a little lacking in the plot and not as much action as one would hope, still serves its purpose in introducing a new audience into the mythical world of gods and heroes.

I wasn't completely blown away by the film, but I did enjoy it quite a bit. Johnson always delivers, and Hercules is no different. Perhaps next time, if there is another to be made, we can get the hero battling some of the gods of mythology: Herc vs Ares? I would be on board. If you like mythology, or maybe you are just looking for an enjoyable action flick, then you have found it with Hercules.",1418515200,,1725,4.435331230283912

They tell the story of Hercules from a different angle.  The world is presented as a conflict between legend and truth, and I found that to be refreshing.  Instead of the indestructible version of Hercules we have seen in past movies, this version is definitely more nuanced.  The supporting cast helps a lot too.

In general, this is a fast paced adventure story with swords and spears.  It just happens to have a guy named Hercules in it with some other Greek names you might recognize.",1418083200,,627,4.636363636363637

The Rock is the best actor in the world, IMO but even he couldn't save the garbage script and writing.  He's a god's son, maybe/not, super strong though.. lots of allusions to stuff from the past the din't bother to even montage.. horrible- not even a decent montage.

I have very low standards for action type flicks- rating total crap as 5 stars but this was just horrible.  I can't imagine what the extended cut would be but it has to, has to, has to be somehow worse than the original ""theatrical cut"".

Die Hollywood, die.  Wish I had just watched WWE wrestling while drinking turpentine.  I've heard at the right quantity, blindness would be almost immediate.",1417478400,,784,4.51063829787234

Not even filming it in 3D could bring to life the 2 dimensional characters
And i am being generous when i say 2 dimensional.
Well except Ian McShane who after giving  us the likes of Deadwood and Lovejoy
Can Do no wrong in my eyes.

2508582,3,B000E372ZY,"This is a mid-level entertaining film, nothing very special about it, but worth watching.

I quite liked Dwayne Johnson's acting in this movie, he was understated and calm except when violent action was called for. He looked the part, of course, which helps. He was backed up by a cast of experienced British actors including John Hurt, Rufus Sewell and most notably Ian McShane as a less-than-omniscient seer, whose one-liners (""Didn't see that coming"") were hilarious.

The plot was fairly minimal and consisted of Hercules being hired, with his team of mercenaries, to lead an army in a war with an opposing warlord. There weren't as many monstrous creatures as usual in Hercules movies, since the opening shots established that this was after the Labors, and most of the action scenes were battles of the 'bodies flying through the air' variety (this is becoming a film genre in its own right, don't you think?).

There is a doublecross and a suitably Herculean ending before the skin-and-sandal clad hero moves on to find his next task. All in all, a good few bucks' worth of entertainment.",1416873600,,1095,4.908108108108108

2508598,4,B000E372ZY,"Hercules is based on the comics by Steve Moore. The title character (Dwayne Johnson) is a sort of con man  a sword-for-hire hulk of a guy who uses his outsize reputation  son of Zeus, slayer of the Hydra  to draw crowds and inflate his price. He wears a costume: the invincible hide of the Nemean lion.

Johnson has always had more than his share of charm, which works well for him here, since Hercules is portrayed more as celebrity than as warrior. Personality counts more than brute strength to make a living. Director Brett Ratner has given the film a light tone, which fits Johnson like a glove. Ratner also delivers on the action, particularly about half-way through as Hercules proves that he can deliver when the going gets tough. Many movies about Hercules tend to be less than stellar and even silly, so the choice to present this Hercules with a knowing wink pays off.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include both theatrical and extended versions, 15 deleted/extended scenes, introduction by Brett Ratner and Dwayne Johnson, 4 making-of featurettes, and digital copy.",1416787200,,1090,4.870270270270271

Of course Dwayne actually showed some acting ability and I loved him in that Tooth Fairy movie. In Pain and Gain he had his shirt off more so it was worthwhile. All up it was a pretty contrived plot and the acting was mostly pedestrian. I thought that ""extended cut"" would mean more shirtless hotness but sadly it means we are treated to some scenes that should have stayed on the cutting room floor. The CGI stuff was ok but I've seen better in TV movies of the week.  I guess if there's nothing else to rent and you're drunk you could watch this. Or if they change the extended cut to actually include more shirtless Dwayne.  As an aside if you watch this with your boyfriend or husband you might get lucky afterwards. I think my comments about Dwayne's hotness made my fianc selfconscious enough that he put in an ""A"" grade effort in a post viewing coitus session.

The action is good.  The one liners made me laugh.  The story does an interesting take on the ""Legend"" of Hercules.  You get to know an interesting band of characters you really get to care about by the end of the film.

At one point I thought, ""Wow, I bet this battle scene is pretty awesome, but I can't really see it.""

I've seen just about every Hercules movie (and TV show) there is, and what I liked best about this particular story was that it's grounded in reality. It shows a real man behind the legend and myth. I've always said myths and legends held some truth to them. Besides, who doesn't want to watch the Rock in action? Loved the cast of characters and the actors portraying them.

I really wanted to believe it might be the thing for taking my mind off of a long week but the acting/plot was so laughable that it put me in a worse off state.

I think the mistake they made was assuming it was anything but an action flick.  There was an attempt at a plot and an attempt at acting.  Unfortunately for us it would have been better if it was just sword play and explosions.

I concede that I watched 'Hercules' as a lark, a perhaps cartoonish pasa tiempo, and after reading some other reviewers who impressed me with their intelligence, which I couldn't have anticipated because, yes, I've been a snotty hoity-toity about Dwayne Johnson movies.  But even given that, I've always intuited some quality about Mr Johnson which I just flat-footed like.  He emanates 'good guy' from the git.  And no man, or woman, can become the type of athlete Mr Johnson has become without paying a price, blood, sweat, tears, that most men just don't have the sand for, and many who do become weird, self-adoring jackasses.  I simply altogether like Dwayne Johnson, as a guy, but have never been taken with Dwayne Johnson movies.  That nasty little hoity-toity streak.  Not this time, friends, not at all.  'Hercules' is a delight.  From first to last.  Wondrously shot, cinematic technologies at their zenith and amazingly so.  Sexy without crudeness, militaristic without vainglory (hey, 'no warriors, no civilization').  And the classy Mr Johnson carries it with a generosity towards his co-stars which all the more speaks of his innate goodness.  Some of the old pros are here, the wondrous John Hurt who just classes up most anything he takes on, and that old asskicker/pro Ian McShane, as a loopy, herb-smoke snorting mystic is having a ball.  There's gore, yeah, and this might be a bit much for our younger warriors and warrior-esses out there, so, good parents be advised.  Concomitantly, I am going to pay much closer attention to the scripts Mr Johnson accepts from here on out.

2508640,3,B000E372ZY,"In this retelling of the age old legend, the makers of this movie are going for a more down to earth feel by premising that the actual legend of Hercules' deeds are less fantastic then the stories portray.  Or at least the roots of the legend are actions of a ""not so ordinary man"" but someone who is most definitely not a demigod.  As seems to be a trend in Hollywood, they are debasing the tales of supernatural heroism that we were all raised on  and making them more gritty and ""realistic"".  While I am not totally opposed to this approach I did find that in this instance it was more disappointing than entertaining.

It might be just me but when it comes to Mythological tales I want to actually see Legendary heroes and Mythological creatures.  But in this adaption of Hercules they took just about every aspect of the Myth and explained it away as exaggerated story telling or some sort of miss-perception. These stories  where made to be larger then life and other worldly but by dragging them back to earth, kicking and screaming, you are making them unimpressive and therefore defeating the purpose of the Myth in the first place.

But I was not totally disappointed by all of the movie. Dwayne Johnson never fails to be a likable character and was a great casting  choice for the ultra strong Hercules, even if the movie didn't have him live up to the legendary strength.  The addition of a motley crew of warriors who supports Hercules was also a fun touch.  The action during the movie was moderately entertaining but honestly could have used more of Dwayne Johnson skull cracking. The story line was typical, rushed, fell short of potential, but was not bereft of virtues.

In the end I felt that while the movie is a good watch, it is not something I would really recommend or ever watch a second time. Taking the Myth out of the Mythology removed all the magic and just made for a lackluster Greek period drama.",1416614400,,1928,4.556521739130435

2508655,4,B000E372ZY,"I am not a Dwayne Johnson fan but in this film he is much better than average.  Unfortunately the story picks up after the
supposed 12 labors the Gods demanded of him.  They show a bit of a couple of the  labors but the story that follows to the best
of my knowledge is totally made up; not from the tales of the GREAT ONE.  By the way, the name is wrong: in Greek his name
was Heracles; Hercules is the Roman name.  A minor point since most Americans are probably unaware lf this.  In this film the
battle scenes are quite good, the sets seem to be faithful for that period and  a pretty good cast surrounded Johnson.  The battle
styles seem to be relatively correct though the warriors swords were iron not steel.  Greeks used 30 foot spears in their Phalanx
military formations; sword fighting was secondary.  Romans perfected the sword dueling and that is why they ruled Europe so long.
The photography was fine, excellent scenery and some hot babes were the rule.  Johnsons acting was rather good; convincing
enough for a historical fuss budget like me to enjoy it.  Good musical score tops the film but I would like to have seen ol' Herc, get
the babe at the end.  He actually looked better than Steve Reeves, but then a bigger budget helped.  For those who like Greek
or Roman mythical stories abeit  somewhat off track from the classics, I think they will enjoy this.  This is not SPARTACUS or
TROY but it makes for enjoyable action entertainment in my opinion.  Four Stars I think it deserves.  I got my DVD from Amazon.

2508657,2,B000E372ZY,"""Hercules"" the ultimate legendary strongman played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" WWF strongman. got his butt whipped at the movie theater box office by the film ""Lucy"" played by actress Scarlet Johansson. Movie fans making ""Lucy"" number one over the film ""Hercules"" were stating in unison by their movie ticket sales ""I Love Lucy"" not so much for Dwayne Johnson's ""Hercules."" Actor Steve Reeves will always be the perfect example of what Hercules would look like and act like.

As Dwayne Johnson continues his unsuccessful frustrated quest to become the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnie had much more success with his ""Conan"" franchise, and with his ""Terminator"" franchise. Arnie had that nasty arrogant swagger that attracted audiences. Let's face it Dwayne, is just too much of a nice guy. Also Dwayne lacks the humor that Arnie displayed in his films.

 The battle scene in ""Hercules"" were impressive yet seemed recycled from the films; ""Gladiator"", ""Braveheart"" and ""Troy."" Another
negative, Dwayne lacked sex appeal for females. His hair (wig) look a shaggy mess, and with his scraggily beard, he looked like a homeless man on steroids. ""The Hercules legend was reputed to be quite the playboy lover fathering hundreds of offspring.  Dwayne's Hercules was sexless and quite one note acting, serious concentration all through the film.

Dwayne is great as a co-star helping other films like ""Fast and Furious"" and ""GI Joe."" Yet Dwayne has trouble opening a film himself and getting that big box office that Arnie always got.",1416441600,,1520,5.137651821862348

The biggest problem with this movie is that the trailers set the complete wrong expectation for it.  If you're looking to see a story about the legendary Hercules (or Heracles, depending on how you want to nitpick mythology) and his twelve labors, this isn't it.  Instead, it takes an alternate look at the man behind the legend to give a fresh take on how things might really have been for someone much closer to human than to god or demigod.  I can forgive various and minor plot issues in favor of calling it a fun ride.

Instead of being a retelling of the classic myth, which could have been very imaginative, it bypasses all of that and attempts to turn Hercules into a real person. The myth being just that, a myth.

I'm just glad I only wasted $4 on the rental and did not waste even more money seeing this when it was in the theater.

2508808,4,B000E372ZY,"Throughout the running time of Director Brett Ratner's 'HERCULES'-2014, we are constantly wondering if our hero is truly the son of Zeus or an incredibly strong human being.  That's what drives the force behind this wonderfully entertaining actioner.  It also is an incredible homage to the sword and sandal epics known as Pepla which emerged from Italy in the late fifties and faded or mutated into the Spaghetti Western.  Actor Dwayne Johnson is not to far off from actor Steve Reeves in the action scenes and venerable Brits John Hurt and Joseph Fiennes spew out their (is he or isn't he ) villainy right down to the last second of the films running time.  The feminine side of the coin is well represented by Ingrid Bolso Bedal as Hercules amazonian archeress and beautiful Rebecca Fergusen who was so impressive in her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth in the excellent mini series 'THE WHITE QUEEN'- 2013 shining as Lord Cotys's daughter ,Eugenia.  Actors Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell round out the mix expertly but sometimes make you feel that the whole thing is just a party.  The CGI effects never overwhelm the viewer as the two '300' films have attested to and the music score by Johannes Vogel and Fernando Velazquez harkens back to those golden days of Saturday matinee movie screenings .  The cinematography is by the great Dante Spinotti and Director Ratner utilizes his images brilliantly.  By the way, kudos to Director Brett Ratner who's only large scale epic was 'X-MEN-THE LAST STAND'-2006  never goes over the top and controls the production expertly including the incredibly impressive Bessi Battle sequence.  The 3D Blu-Ray is eye popping but the normal Blu-Ray can deliver the goods just as well in the battle sequences and the legend scenes featuring the mythical Lion, Hydra, and Cerebus beasts.  The special features and extended Directors cut are just contained on the Blu-Ray release with the regular DVD and Blu-Ray 3D emerging as no frills theatrical versions so the buyer can decide which way to go.  If you love epic battles and just down and out muscleman antics , click the add to cart button and prepare for a nice diversion that should have garnered a better reputation at the time of its release.",1416096000,,2229,4.883289124668435

2508837,4,B000E372ZY,Dwayne Johnson truly brings a warmth to this version of Hercules than none of the others who portrayed him have.  You get to see side kicks he has and each have their own personality and present excitement all through out the movie.  I even shed some tears as well so the characters do draw you in which I never got from the previous versions. For those who went to see this movie in 2D did not get the most out of the movie.  The 3D really knocks your socks off.  Definitely restricted for violence for the young adults but a fun ride.  I viewed it three times the day I got it and saw more each time I viewed it.  Have fun on this fantasy journey.  Dwayne Johnson can be proud of this movie - I am!,1416009600,,700,4.065693430656935

2508843,5,B000E372ZY,"I have always been a fan of the Hercules and Greek/Roman mythos.  Finally we see a convincing take on a great story, that approaches him in a bit more of a realistic way.  We see how the legends are built up, and enhanced, by populations that just want hope in uncertain times (and with a bit of planned propaganda).  Yet, the spirit of the legends are held true by a man that is a hero at heart.
As with many of Dwayne Johnson's roles and movies, the storyline is handled with plenty of fast paced action, good humor, and a sense of heroic but down to earth perspective.",1415923200,,571,4.268518518518518

I know that there are going to be people that are going to disagree with this but I say that the acting is great. I didn't have any problem with any of the characters & they way that they were portrayed, they way that they mingled in the story & they were very believable.
And this is not a movie that depends on the special effects or action to make it enjoyable. It is a movie that combines the 2 very well so that the you are drawn into it.
The action - I can't think of any other words that, Fantastic & Well Done. And it is really good to see the ""girl"" knock some of the characters around. But each of the characters are involved in the action. It all isn't depending on the Rock or his scenes to have you enjoy it. Each one has some action in it.

The acting wasn't particularly outstanding, but it wasn't a distraction.  It's still an over used story (Standoff-ish hero with a tragic past develops feelings... blah blah blah).

But he was duped and had to fight for his life again against an unscrupulous king.

The Rock is entertaining but the rest of his ensemble of heroes are just talking heads with little to do but perform their ""one individual thing"" during combat or to explain Hercules' background.

2509080,5,B000E372ZY,"They chose to take this movie in a different direction than I had expected. I thought with todays special effects it would be a golden opportunity to tell the classic Greek story of Hercules & his 12 labors which would have made the old classic a new classic & the safest & surest formula for a box office smash! Instead they took the classic tale in a new direction combining the classic tale with a new twist turning the Greek Demi God into a more mortal character who's legendary deeds were accomplished with the aid of Hercules's mercenary friends leaving you questioning his Demi god status throughout the film. Although I would have preferred a more traditional reprisal of the classic story I must say this version delivers! It is action packed & ends up promoting good moral values by the time the tale ends. It does contain enough of the original storyline to satisfy lovers of the Greek Mythology's even though it strays far beyond the original story.  I don't want to go into details & spoil the movie so the best advice I can give is the advice that was given to me by my daughter who saw this movie on the big screen, she said ""I think you will like it dad, if you don't expect to see the original story.""  This had mentally prepared me to be open & ready to see this film without presuppositions. And I enjoyed it a lot more then I would have if I had I not been forewarned. So I added this to my 5 other ""Hercules"" movies & am patiently waiting for some ambitious Hollywood director to breath new life into the ancient Greek story of Greek Mythology's mightiest hero!",1415577600,4,1582,4.43298969072165

2509083,5,B000E372ZY,"Four Hercules films came out in 2014 that I know about and I own three. This one is the best for several reasons:
1. The action sequences are plentiful and done with precision and flair
2. All the characters are extremely well cast and cause you to believe every word that they say
3. The storyline is the best of all even though the outcome is easy to figure out. It is has something for everyone in the family, there are jokes, romance and action of all sorts from beast to armies.
4. Another plus is that this movie is very family friendly for all ages. Perfect for a Saturday evening, so get your popcorn ready and enjoy yourself.

Finally, The Legend of Hercules is a very close second if you can get two but it is clearly for an older audience with less action and storyline details.",1415577600,6,789,4.331081081081081

It seems these days it's all about entertaining you through constant action sequences  without any real story to tell or having any real substance. There is no real connection to any of the clich sidekick characters - a bow wielding female, axe wielding maniac, knife throwing stealthy dude, etc. Yawn. They try their best to take the super out of supernatural affirming mythological creatures (you know, the cool stuff they can do in movies) as mere myth, including any obvious hints Hercules may actually be the son of Zeus, and force you to sit through most of the movie watching 'been there done that' mele battles between armies controlled by the clich (deceiving) evil king.

2509106,3,B000E372ZY,"""Hercules"" (2014) stars Dwayne Johnson in the title role where fantastical aspects of the legend are attributed to storytellers and the movie focuses on an exceptional man with great strength.

You have to be careful with humor with these kinds of sword & sandal flicks because too much of a tongue in cheek approach will spoil it. They had just the right amount in 1982's ""Conan the Barbarian"" that kept it from being too heavy without turning into a joke. They try to do the same with ""Hercules,"" but aren't as successful. I prefer the more serious approach of ""Troy"" and ""King Arthur.""

I always thought The Rock (Johnson) had the potential to be a great action star, like Schwarzenegger, and ""Hercules"" proves this. In fact, he's better, but Arnie had better movies. I'm hoping Johnson will get better films too, although ""Hercules"" isn't bad, it's just that the first half has a been-there-done-that feel, not to mention the we're-only-taking-this-so-seriously vibe. Thankfully, the second half gets better whereupon we find out not all is as it appears. I also like Hercules' likable band of misfits that become their own family.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Hercules"" is a well-done sword & sandal fantasy/action romp, highlighted by The Rock in the eponymous role, but it's too hackneyed and campy compared to its betters.

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Croatia and Hungary.

2509107,5,B000E372ZY,"Last summer saw a rebirth of the Hercules legend with its genesis in Hollywood with Mr. America/Pro. Universe, Steve Reeves (the muscle man who was featured in comic books that created a generation of bullied youths who took up the sport with the view of payback) which later featured Arnold Schwarzenegger's role model as an aspiring bodybuilder in Austria, the next major champion to defeat Steve Reeves as Mr. Pro. Universe, U.K.'s Reg Park (who was given first class travel arrangements and accommodations for his role),  which will later be played by Lou Ferrigno (who had the most successful run of Hercules movies and whom most cinema audiences associate with the Hercules franchise), a role which Arnold will later assume in the box office flop Hercules in New York; given the fact that the last Hercules movie featuring Arnold was in the seventies, Renny Harlin figured it was time to reboot the entire franchise with a box office flop entitled, The Legend of Hercules, in the same manner that Rupert Wyatt deemed necessary to reboot the critically acclaimed Planet of the Apes franchise that was based on Pierre Boulle's Ape Planet, which had a successful run in the seventies as a box office trilogy and was serialized for TV - given its unsuccessful reboot as a franchise by Tim Burton, resulting in a similar reboot to the Hercules franchise this summer in a phenomenal box office hit by Brett Ratner, featuring awesome CGI by Double Negative, and the most awesome physique since Arnold and Lou - with Dwayne Johnson, playing Hercules and the handsome Ingrid Bolso Berdal playing Atalanta, the only female heroine, with Hercules being commissioned by King Eurystheus to serve as protector of Rome to defeat twelve  mythical creatures that was threatening the empire, which was supposedly sent by his father, Zeus' wife, Hera, to task Hercules owing to jealousy over her husband having mated with a mortal woman, Hercules' mother, Alcmene, following which he butchered Hercules's family and spread rumors to the effect that Hercules had butchered his wife, Megara, and their children, and, having done so, banished Hercules from Rome, following which Hercules transforms into a mercenary for hire and finds himself being commissioned by Lord Coty to train an army of peasant to rise against Rhesus (which gave birth to Obama and John Kerry's strategy in Syria and Iraq) - who was the only one who rose in protest against Lord Cotys after he has poisoned Ergenia's husband to claim the throne, with Hercules, eventually, uncovering the truth from Ergenia and turning against Lord Cotys, who was colluding with King Eurystheus in an attempt at world conquest, and, having done so, discovering Hercules defying him, and unearthing the truth about what King Eurystheus did to his family, and, thereby, turning against the invincible army he had trained and successfully defeating them, defying the prediction of his oracle, Amphiaraus - who had prophesized Hercules' and his own death, thereby, claiming his rightful place as the legend of a true hero, which resides in each and everyone one of us as Mariah Carey implied in her song, Hero.",1415491200,5,3148,5.040307101727447

2509110,1,B000E372ZY,"If you feel like watching the movie because you are impressed by the trailer, you will be sorely disappointed.  The labors are a flash in the movie.  I couldn't get into the character, even though Dwayne Johnson is perfect for the role.  There was nothing wrong with him, it was the rest of the movie.  His cohorts were all small and puny, so I could not get into them at all. There wasn't anything impressive about the battles, and the plot was weak and boring...oh, and I can't stand when a movie with so much profound potential, has several wisecracks that were not clever and certainly would not be made by anyone in those times.  It felt more like a cartoon than a story of antiquity.  Very disappointing, boring...horrible really",1415491200,6,735,4.615384615384615
2509111,4,B000E372ZY,"In this retelling of Hercules, Hercules has endured his legendary twelve labors and become a sword-for-hire for the King of Thrace and his daughter seeking his aid in defeating of a rival warlord.

This is not the story of Hercules (Johnson) as it was originally told and after watching this I really didn't mind that so much.  Part of that reason was that the previous Legend of Hercules movie was so bad that the movie makers could only go up from there.

Johnson was a good choice as Hercules and certain played the role well, certainly much better than the actor in the Legend movie out this year.  In fact, I am surprised we haven't seen him in a Conan remake.  The supporting cast and his team of mercenaries are an eclectic set of characters and work well for the movie.

This is less of a fantasy movie focused on monsters and gods but more of a movie that portrays Hercules as a more realistic hero whose legend has developed by some fanciful story telling.  I really didn't mind that as it gave a sense of reality to the hero and I liked the way it was portrayed.  The battle scenes are immense and epic and very well done..there are so many extras (real and CG) that it really does give a sense of a huge battle.

One of the many things that fell flat with the previous Legend of Hercules movie was the spectacular failure of the cheap CG graphics.  This movies special effects was good and well done for the most part, although having just recently watched Malificient, the graphics were not quite up to that level but still good nonetheless.  Even the moments of humor fit in well and doesnt seem out of place.

For those who prefer the more mythical Hercules, then you may not like this.  But I prefer this more grounded version and thought it was well done.  4 stars..",1415491200,,1783,4.429447852760736
2509112,3,B000E372ZY,Forget the Kevin Sorbo Hercules from TV.  This is a totally different telling of the story.  This Hercules is the leader of a band of mercenaries that fights for whoever is paying the most money.  Hercules does have a personal code and when he finds out he's on the wrong side he walks away from the gold and switches sides.  On the plus side Dwayne Johnson seems to have figured this acting  thing out and I didn't once think of him as a wrestler.  The special effects are also well done.  There's plenty of blood and gore for fans of that.,1415491200,,541,4.297029702970297

The 3d did it's job of depth and even a few fun pop-out moments. The movie it self was a fun watch with plenty of action and some great battles,WITHOUT the vicious blood flying everywhere..

The ""man-behind-the-myth"" story-line was an interesting take on the material, and the addition of his ""crew"" was a welcome one. The female warrior with the bow was particularly impressive, with a fighting style that reminded me a great deal of Legolas from LOTR.

Johnson himself was a convincing and likable Hercules; bridging the divide between life and legend in the end. The production qualities were strong, as were the special effects.

I rented the movie first, then liked it enough that I bought it. My family will enjoy watching it over Thanksgiving.

For each successive he's been able to improve his range of emotions. and it can be both a pleasant surprise when he pulls off a scene and cringe inducing when you know he just can't pull it off.

Movie was funny and good Soundtrack also. Deleted scenes and Extended cut was massive, you basically get twice the movie i love this!!!
Also there are good portions of how the movie was filmed and made. It appears directors are going back to old-school camera shooting instead of all this Green room garbage.

First let me say that the reviewers that claimed this movie had no action or was boring are clearly children weaned on bloodbath video games and the attention spans of gnats.  It is a fun movie with plenty of action, absolutely no frontal nudity or sex scenes which is refreshing to be quite honest.  The blood and gore is minimized and Hercules' merry band of mercenaries are engaging and fun to watch.

Hercules is still very strong, but mortal and the way the story illustrates that legends are born from stories exaggerated and spread.  And probably liberal uses of hallucinogens that are hinted at.

Finally, you can't argue that watching Dwayne Johnson walking around in a loin cloth isn't an entertainment all on its own.",1415059200,,771,4.7593984962406015

When he is approached by a king to free his land from a warlord he takes it but soon he questions who he is fighting, and why. I have to admit that I was not looking forward to watching this at all. I'm not a huge fan of The Rock or mythology and the last Hercules movie they made was terrible. Going in with those expectations I have to say I was surprised. This is a movie that was much much better than I expected it to be. The action and acting were pretty much what I expected but this one had something that the Legend Of Hercules didn't...humor. That little change and the fact that it didn't take itself too serious made this a fun movie to watch. Overall, I really think fans of this genre will love this.

Also, let's face it, Duane Johnson is no Robert Deniro or even a Al Pacino.  The Rock is famous for that gorgeous body and I would of thought he'd show more of it.

2509294,5,B000E372ZY,"I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between extended cuts and their theatrical counterparts, so here are the differences between the two (NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW).

The extended cut runs approximately 3 minutes longer longer than the theatrical cut.  The new scenes are pretty minor, although there is significantly more CGI blood in the first battle.

1) The first battle against the Bessi is a lot bloodier in the Extended Cut.  Throats are slit, combatants are impaled, and people are stabbed in bloody manners by various bladed weapons.

2) General Sitacles makes unwanted romantic advances towards Atalanta.

3) General Sitacles threatens to execute Phineas for failing to detect the Bessi ambush, but Phineas is saved by Autolycus's intervention.

4) Hercules has a flashback to King Eurystheus condemning him for the alleged murder of his family.

Sure Hercules isn't going to win any Oscars anytime soon, but I found it an entertaining popcorn flick.  The Rock was fun to watch and I liked the script's tongue-in-cheek approach to general Greek mythology.  Definitely better than the Kellan Lutz version!",1414368000,8,1128,5.357954545454546

After the 'twist' (I guess), there is some good drama/action in the cave for maybe 10-15 minutes. then we go back outside and it gets odd again.

SO, 10-15 very well done minutes wrapped into 100 or so minutes of, well, something else. Always looks okay though. Probably a 2 1/2 star deal.

This was not the case at all, and in truth it reminded me of Scorpion King with the way they put in a couple of serious moments along with many attempts at humorous moments. I say ""attempts"" because the humor utterly failed for me.

It took everything I had to sit through the whole movie. It was a close call, I can tell you that, but now that I've seen it I can tell you that i'll never watch it again. Such a letdown!!

Then you have the people that just say ""Horrible"" and give it one star. Yeah that's real helpful. If you want to truth about this movie listen up because I'm going to keep it short.

The trailer makes it seem higher budget than it really is and it's a little cheesy. Don't expect a super serious take on the Hercules legend. The first clue is during the first action fight sequence when some really bad rock music with drums comes on that makes you think ""Oh boy, this is gonna be one of THOSE movies huh ..."" The next clue is the cheesy attempts at humor with goofy one-liners.

The action is ok, there are some decent fight scenes but the storyline is pretty mediocre ... without ruining it it's the typical one man on a mission for justice theme with a bunch of under-utilized sidekicks. The movie overall is pretty amateur. This isn't Spielberg or Christopher Nolan stuff... it's a passable flick if you're bored and half-watching while doing something else.

Starting from the beginning of this feature, Brett Ratner tries using snippets, starting with the twelve labours, the Lernaean Hydra, the Erymanthian Boar, and the Nemean Lion, in order to spark your mind into a mode of imagination. It is not always just about the special effects. But, the special effects you do get in the beginning sets the tone and the abilities of Hercules and allows time for your imagination to work along in concert. Now on with a good story that portrays him as a Hero and a Warrior in a B - Movie style of course. This movie was made to be fun, entertaining, with a big feel that makes you want to jump in and participate, and when it was over I still felt exhilarated. Great job Brett Ratner !

If you still haven't left yet, theres more.

It turns out that while Hercules is strong, his legend is infact just thata legend. It turns out that the Hydra was just a bunch of men in the masks of lizard monsters who were trying to scare people away from something, I cant remember what as I was face-palming myself to hard to hear anything else. And they wouldve gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids and their Hercules.

The Nemean Lions hide, which Hercules wears on his person like a cape, is said to be invulnerable to bladeswell guess what, that was a lie too. In fact, it seems like all of the legendary or magic things in this movie turn out to be lies made up to boost Hercules street-cred. Like right when I thought the movie was gonna get good, this band of con-artists discover that magic does exist as Centaurs come to battleNOPE, just a weird angle with the light to their back. Regular men on horseback.

They help him win the war he was loosing,
Find out hes bad,
Then decided theyll be good and stop him,
Ill be honest; Im not sure how the rest of the movie goes.

Most movies based on Greek Legends tend to aim for the ""classical"" feel. A larger than life hero, Gods themselves battling, Titans clashing and all of that. That's usually all well and good but it's... well... overplayed at this point. I think the film makers recognized this.

In this version of Hercules, the story is about the legendary Hercules being hired as a mercenary to fight a mythic army of centaurs. The story is somewhat straight forward with some twists here and there that are sometimes mildly expected.

All in all, it's enjoyable and entertaining. The production quality is very high and it's altogether well done. On the downside, it sometimes seems a little awkward in its pacing. (Also, much better than the other hercules movie)",1410566400,,840,4.8671328671328675

What did I think?

Despite a lackluster and seemingly cliched trailer, Hercules is actually a surprisingly fun action flick. It doesn't reach any real heights but what is there will keep you entertained. Ratners decision to start the movie AFTER the mythological labors really works especially considering the rather intelligent sub-plot of spin doctoring.

There is some characters' depth related to comradeship and hard working. Here, Hercules had to work very hard to achieve what he wanted even though he's very strong. That makes me feel connected to him. Another reason I love it is the black humor regarding fate.

What more could The Rock want to show how much he loves himself than being cast as the invincible Greek hero and demigod? Needless to say I went in with rock bottom expectations, thinking that the movie would bring me two hours of mindless action and sex appeal.

But the director and producers took a Christopher Nolan approach to this tale, bringing us the real man behind the impossible legend and showing his weaknesses and flaws. The legend of Hercules is spun by his nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie), a boy with a silver tongue who tells of the grand feats his uncle Hercules has accomplished, how he slayed the hydra and defeated the lion whose hide could not be pierced. The rest of his party, Tydeus (Askel Hennie), a tortured and mangled feral man who has lost the ability to speak, Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) a deadly accurate Amazon sniper, Amphiaraus (Ian McShane), a spear-wielding prophet who gains wisdom and foresight from the Gods and Autolycus (Rufus Sewell), a scoundrel with a quick wit and an eye for profit, all work together to ensure that the tall tales told about Hercules ring true.

At its worst, Hercules is another Dwayne Johnson movie, fast paced and rife with action that glorifies his own legend. At its best, it's witty, funny, well-written and isn't bogged down by other superstar talent. My only hope is that this movie helps boost the careers of its other actors, particularly Reece Ritchie and Tamina Snuka, as Johnson and John Hurt (who plays a king desperate enough to hire Hercules and his band to save his kingdom) already have all the fame and glory they could want.",1409270400,8,1726,4.711920529801325
2509347,3,B000E372ZY,"Hercules (2014)

***

Legend has it that Hercules was presented with twelve rites, obstacles or challenges, set by the god Hera, Zeus wife, because she was upset about her husbands infidelities with a human. The result of the tryst, a son, Hercules, was given these rites to earn his life. If he completed them, Hera would let him live.

Watching Hercules (2014), director Brett Rattners new film, you might begin to get an idea of what the Greek mythological hero had to go through. Not because the film attempts to be overly accurate, but because it feels like a trial to sit through any Brett Rattner film.

The horses of Diamedes

I don't like Brett Rattners films. All smack of commercialism and don't show the work of a director who is more interested in the artistic rather than the commercial aspects of any film he is working on. His resume consists of Rush Hour and the two sequels, a sequel to X-Men, and Tower Heist. He also contributed a couple of segments to compilation films. When you make a short film for a compilation, it is usually a pretty low-risk affair and an opportunity for the director and those involved to stretch themselves and create something different. Rattners contributions to these films are equally forgettable. His next project? Beverly Hills Cop 4. He also seems to be someone more interested in being famous. Look at his IMDB profile; it includes the price of his home. Now, look at the person who wrote the profile; Rattner himself. Why is it necessary to know how many millions he paid for his home? What connection does the price he paid for his home have on his work? It points to a frame of mind. It shows he may be more interested in the material than the artistic.

Watching Rattners films makes me feel like I am walking through horse stables that have never been cleaned. I wish I had the ability to divert two rivers to clear away the muck.

The boar of Erymanthus...

That rant aside, I liked Hercules more than I thought I would. Predictable? Yes. Corny? Of course. But the take on the story is interesting and that, along with pretty good special effects, helped to hold my interest. The film actually managed to get through my thick hide. But just a little bit.

The hydra of Lerna

The hydra is a snake-like creature that is supposed to have hundreds of heads. As soon as Hercules chops one off, it grows another. In the film, it looks like they brought that number down to three. The dog Cerberus, another rite, has three heads, but the filmmakers seem to want to avoid any mention of Hades, where the dog lives, so he isn't mentioned at all. Perhaps each of the Hydra's three heads represent the two writers and the director.

This battle is also, by far, the least convincing. The creature looks like he is created with Computer generated imagery (or CGI), which is more noticeable because all of the other creatures seem so real.

Written by Ryan Condal (his first feature) and Evan Spiliotopoulos (writer of many Disney direct-to-video sequels), the film begins with Iolaus (Reece Ritchie, The Prince of Persia, The Lovely Bones) telling the tale of Hercules (Dwayne Johnson) fighting some of the rites sent to him by Hera, the wife of Zeus, Hercules father. Hera isn't too happy that her husband had an affair with a mortal, so she is determined to kill the bastard child. But he proves to be strong, very strong, and the tales of his exploits begin to precede him, allowing him to become a well-paid for-hire mercenary. But Hercules travels with an entourage- Amphiaraus (Ian McShane) who can sometimes see the future and wields a mean sword, Autolycus (Rufus Sewell), Hercules right hand man, Tydeus (Aksel Hennie), a mute brute who wields his mean temper like a weapon, Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal), an Amazon who is good with arrows and Iolaus,his nephew who is a good storyteller, ready and willing to spread the legend of Hercules. They are hired by Lord Cotys (John Hurt), the king of Thrace, and General Sitacles (Peter Mullan) to lead a rag-tag army in a fight against Rhesus (Tobias Santelmann) who is advancing through the kingdom, threatening their way of life.

The hind of Ceryneia

The golden deer is an animal Hercules was tasked to trap, not kill. An animal that moved very fast, according to legend.

When you go to a film called Hercules, you might rightfully expect to see another rendition of the legend. But the filmmakers aren't so interested in remaining reverent to the legend; Iolaus tells us the tale in the opening minutes and we see all of the highlights, almost in a Cliff Notes fashion. Some of the highlights end before he even begins the battle, we simply see a creature advancing on him. It is an interesting way to approach the material, by casting doubt on it, making it a tall tale to the people hearing it in the film. These moments are handled well through the introduction of Iolaus and hearing him tell the tale.

These moments are fast-paced, but seem a little incomplete. When the film gets to the gamey meat of the story, the tale slows down. It no longer seems impossible to keep up, with the characters, with the rites, with any part of the film.

The Nemean Lion

This tale is presented, very briefly, in the beginning of the film. And Herc wears the lions head and fur throughout the film. Or does he wear any lions head and fur?

But this also presents a conundrum. If Hercules is the result of spreading tall tales, living on his reputation, who is this Hercules? Dwayne Johnson (he has apparently dropped The Rock from his name, I suspect in a bid for legitimacy) plays Herc as a hired mercenary, someone who knows how to fight, but doesnt necessarily have any super-human strength or powers. This makes him more human, more fallible, more of a mortal. And this also makes the idea of our heros background as a half-God less viable. Essentially, this Hercules is simply a really buff dude who may have had battles with some mythical beasts. But he can and will lead your army for some gold. While this is an interesting take on the story, it also makes the title character less special and less interesting.

The Cretan bull...

Johnson does what he can with the role, but it is a performance that we have seen many, many times before. There have been a number of films about a charismatic leader taking his rag-tag band of mercenaries into a situation that quickly becomes dangerous. Both modern and classic interpretations are virtually identical; a man, full of himself and riding the glory of past conquests, takes his loyal band of marauders into one last job which will give them enough money (gold, farthings, doubloons, cash) to allow them to retire. The last job always presents the most challenges and pits our heroes against the most dangerous foe, before they then realize they have two or three additional challenges to overcome before reaching safety.

Johnson makes Hercules an earnest leader, who cares for the band of warriors who follow him around. But he just isn't that interesting. He seems a bit timid, when what we really want from Dwayne Johnson playing Hercules is a bull running through the streets. I mean, come on, Johnson was literally made for the role.

The birds of Stymphalus...

Ian McShane does a nice job of injecting a moment or two of levity into the otherwise serious tale. Amphiaraus is quickly established as someone who can see the future and McShane wrings a few laughs out of this.

Rufus Sewell plays the business manager and voice of reason in the group. But Autolycus is loyal to Hercules and willing to fight to the death to protect his friend.

Aksel Hennie plays Tydeus, a mean brute who seems to be more animalistic than the others. He also doesnt speak, mentally damaged by events in his past. Because he doesnt speak, we don't learn or see a lot of his character, snippets of his life revealed by others, punctuated by his haunted eyes.

Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) is probably the least interesting because she is the most stereotypical to this type of story. A tough-as-nails female warrior (the filmmakers go the extra step and claim she is an Amazon) who has to prove she is as tough as the men she fights alongside.

John Hurt is good as Lord Cotys, the leader of Thrace and Peter Mullan adds the right level of skepticism and jealousy to his portrayal of General Siticles. Unfortunately, anyone who has seen a film like this, heck, any film, will be able to see the twist involving their characters coming a mile away.

All of these character actors, some with long, respected careers, might lead you to expect performances with more passion, something creating more noise to rattle us out of our movie theater seats. Instead, they all come off as rather timid. Barely enough to scare a pigeon out of its roost.

The apples of Hesperides...

Some may think I am expecting too much. But filmmaking is an art in both literal and figurative terms. Part of the art is asking the right people to be part of the project. Because Brett Rattner is involved, I would expect this version to be a little more tongue-in-cheek, especially with the involvement of The Rock. But both play it fairly straight.

As a straight-on rendition of the legend, ""Hercules"" never really achieves the level of suspense or gravitas to make it work.

A 'good' version of ""Hercules"" is what we have here. The 'great' version seems to be as hard found as the apples of Hesperides.",1408579200,4,9425,4.675528700906344

2509350,3,B000E372ZY,"One of the most interesting thing about mythology is considering: what people or events might have inspired legends of gods, heroes and monsters?

That question seems to have inspired ""Hercules,"" the second movie about the Grecian strongman in less than a year... and thankfully, it involves no bleached-haired ""Twilight"" actors. Instead, this simple and cheesy yet action-packed story depicts a ""realistic"" Hercules played by the charismatic Dwayne Johnson, who is one of the few men alive who actually LOOKS like Hercules.

In this movie, Hercules (Johnson) is the leader of a band of mercenaries -- including an Amazon warrior, a thief, a feral berserker and a seer who is waiting for his death to turn up -- who take on ridiculously difficult tasks. Hercules' nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) works PR for them, spreading stories of how Hercules is supposedly the offspring of Zeus, explaining his ridiculously awesome strength. The reality is a bit more tragic, as indicated in flashbacks to his pre-merc days to a wife and children who have just two days until retirement.

Then Hercules is approached by Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson), a Thracian princess whose dad Cotys (John Hurt) wants him to train his army to resist the warlord Rheseus (Tobias Santelmann). Hercules and his compatriots successfully fix up the rather pathetic army into a successful fighting force, and even lead them into battle... but soon Hercules begins to suspect that he and his followers have been tricked into being on the wrong side.

""Hercules"" is a pure popcorn movie -- it has no pretensions of being deep or artistic, and while it's not a great movie, it's not a bad one either. It's basically a movie devoted to big smashy-shooty battles full of fire and Hercules hitting things with a club. And it doesn't take itself seriously, giving the characters a lot of funny moments (""Excuse me, that was my fate!"") until things go dark at the climax.

And it is an interesting exercise in whatiffery: what if the legends of Hercules were based on a real man with abnormal strength? Fortunately,  Brett Ratner doesn't try to make it TOO realistic, mainly by giving everything an over-the-top atmosphere -- sort of a lighter, less stylized ""300"" feel. It's handled in a manner cheesy enough to make it amusing, but not so cheesy that it becomes ridiculous.

And Dwayne Johnson... well, is there any other actor better suited to playing Hercules? He's huge, he has big muscles, he's good at one-liners, and he has buckets of charisma that just make him darn likable. But he's also able to handle the tragedy of Hercules' past nicely, and conveys his grief despite us seeing almost nothing of Herc's wife and kids.

That said, Johnson is the only main character who gets a lot of development -- out of his whole posse, only McShane's character gets more than a single character trait (Autolycus = greedy, Tydeus = animalistic, Atalanta = female), and they have some nice bonding moments. The other actors are quite good, but not given much, though Ferguson has a decent role as a sorta-kinda-maybe love interest, whose young son adores Hercules.

As for the villains... well, they're so cartoonishly evil that it becomes ridiculous. Joseph Fiennes is almost comically bad here, campily snickering and smarming until you wish he had a Snidely Whiplash mustache just so he could twirl it. Not since the ""Twilight"" movies have I been so... AMUSED by a villain.

""Hercules"" isn't a great movie, but it's probably the best Hercules movie in decades -- wry, action-packed and with a clever meta-mythic twist. It's definitely worth a watch when you want some fiery, over-the-top action.",1407542400,6,3654,4.975409836065574

Worth seeing it again; my kids approved highly! Just got pissed that my theater's fan broke, therefore canceling our 3d showing. That was the only downside.",1407369600,2,306,4.482142857142857

2509353,5,B000E372ZY,"Great movie--lots of action and battle scenes.  Dwayne Johnson does a great job as Hercules, son of Zeus, a humble man who really only wants to spend time with his wife and children.  But, sinister forces of the corrupt and greedy, want to use Hercules' strength and reputation to satisfy their own desires for conquest and rule.  John Hurt, Ian McShane, Joseph Fiennes, Rufus Sewell, and others do a great job as you watch alliances between friends grow even stronger while tyranny reigns in places not always obvious.  Hercules endures his 12 labors in the beginning, showing you how the legend came about.

Great entertainment.",1407369600,2,630,4.961904761904762
2509354,2,B000E372ZY,"This movie was awful! I had high hopes and was very disappointed. I love mythology and this movie had the gall to suggest that Hercules may not be. I didn't like that. Besides, if your going to beat on animals your butt better be related to someone on Mt. Olympus!! Bad acting, really, Dwayne Johnson was more believable in The Rundown, "" Are you finished beating me up??"" I love that line. But I just couldn't buy his performance in this one. The other actors weren't any better except Rebecca Ferguson, in one particular scene as an outraged mother, I felt her pain. It was cool to see the Thracian army moving into position, but that's not nearly enough to justify the price of admission. Unless you really love an actor/actress in this, miss it. At least until it's cheaper to view. Got a dollar theater in your area??",1407369600,2,822,4.523489932885906
2509355,3,B000E372ZY,"I went in with low expectation, and it managed to barely meet them.  It's not so much that Dwayne Johnson had me worried.  Brett Ratner on the other hand is a bit of a hack.  He's made a specialty out of doing big dumb action movies, emphasis on the dumb.  Hercules doesn't really break from this legacy of sorts.  If you're looking for fidelity to Greek myth, skip this.  If you're looking for an interesting variation on the story with an almost passable theory on legend and myth making, then you might enjoy this.  I don't want to go too much into detail because it could spoil the actual premise of the movie.  It's fun, occasionally humorous, occasionally dripping in unearned pathos.  Johnson does a decent job as an action hero, though this is a performance he could have easily phoned in.  The script doesn't take much in the way of risks aside from the liberties it takes with the Hercules mythology, which makes the legitimacy of this as a ""Hercules"" movie questionable, and it doesn't really do much of anything surprising in terms of plot--most of the ""twists"" are broadcast so far enough in advance that if you're paying any attention at all, the only thing you're going to be shocked by is that someone in a writing room or a director's meeting thought there would be an element of surprise to it..  It's not going to be a winning choice for a mythology curriculum looking for a movie to fit into the schedule (unless the teacher has no idea what s/he's doing), but it gives you a chance to shut your brain off, eat some popcorn, and not have to think about it too much afterwards.  And that's probably the most commendable or damning thing about the movie, depending on your point of view--it occupies its moment, but leaves nothing to dwell on once the credits role.  Worth a rental if this is your kind of movie.  Not going to convert you to an action fan if you don't like them.  Fantasy/mythology fans may want to skip this because it takes quite a bit of the myth out of the mythology.",1406937600,,2006,4.487603305785124

2509357,4,B000E372ZY,"Wasn't there supposed to be a ""...happily ever after..."" when Hercules finished his twelve labors? Not according to the Greek goddess Hera and director Brett Ratner (""Tower Heist""). Nope. Things are just getting started. Our hero hires out as a mercenary, along with five other misbegotten souls, to a beleaguered King of Thrace and his daughter Ergenia. He tries to form an army out of farmers, but runs out of time.

We have:
  * Dwayne Johnson (""Fast & Furious 6"") as Hercules, son of Zeus (which makes him a demigod but only brings him misery), is now trying to examine how far he has fallen.
  * Ian McShane (""Cuban Fury"") Amphiaraus can forecast his own death...maybe.
  * Rufus Sewell (""The Pillars of the Earth"") Autolycus can't see why they don't just take the money and run.
  * Aksel Hennie (""Headhunters"") Tydeus is the ferocious fellow who was rescued from a battlefield as an infant. He has never spoken a word.
  * Ingrid Bols Berdal (""Chernobyl Diaries"") Atalanta isn't just a book store in Bisbee, Arizona. It is also the name of the cracker- jack archer who makes up the rest of the team.
  * Reese Ritchie (""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"") is Iolaus, our hero's nephew, a little too eager to fight, but a good story- teller, nonetheless.
  * John Hurt (""Snowpiercer"") Lord Cotys is my choice for a pragmatic politician.
  * Rebecca Ferguson (""The White Queen"") is Ergenia, his unhappy daughter.
  * Joseph Fiennes (""American Horror Story"") is King Eurystheus, the fellow who knows more than he admits.

This PG-13 adventure is loaded with fanged critters, lots of sword fights and military drilling. There is no blowie uppie stuff, but we see burning oil and a collapsing temple. There is only one ""F"" bomb in the whole thing and it is appropriately used. I really enjoyed the delicious bits of humor that are scattered throughout, particularly when delivered by McShane. He either got the best dialogue or made the best of what he was given.

The screening audience was delighted. To quote one happy fellow, ""Great fun for a B-level movie!"" Remember, movies are primarily Entertainment, and this one is entertaining. Oh! And the 3-D is better than usual: I dodged more than one spear, but not worth upgrading your DVD player from Amazon yet.",1406851200,6,2267,4.791237113402062
2509358,3,B000E372ZY,"Renny Harlin's ""Legend of Hercules"" that was released earlier this year wasn't very good. Maybe that's why Brett Ratner's ""Hercules"" is coming out now, in the middle of the summer when there's a fresh new audience of people that no longer remember ""Legend"". The two movies, while about the same thing, are like night and day. ""Legend"" was more mythological and true to the legend of the strongman and ""Hercules"" is more grounded in reality; focusing upon how legends are created and exaggerated.

I found this aspect of ""Herclues"" really rewarding because I like things grounded in reality. Even when things get ridiculous, I like when they play it off as ridiculous, rather than normalcy. Ratner took all the mythological aspects of Hercules and made them stories or possible exaggerations to be believed or not. On the surface, Hercules (Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock) is just a man with great size and strength, but his legend has spread and he is worshipped as something more than just a man.

""Hercules"" did a lot of things right but that depends upon what you're looking for. If you're looking for something along the lines of ""300"" or ""Clash of the Titans"", look elsewhere. As I said, this is Hercules grounded in reality. There will be nothing portrayed here that is beyond possibility. Ratner makes sure that you have a strong emotional contact with Hercules and his band of warriors; again, something I really like.

This was a role that Dwayne Johnson was seemingly born to play and it is probably one of his best movies to date. Surprisingly enough, along with the machismo, the movie is written with some pretty good comedy as well; which adds to the personal connection you feel with the characters. ""Hercules"" is a step up from ""Legend of Hercules"" due to its character development and story, but not a huge step up. It still lacks in importance and it still had a conclusion you could see a mile away. The outstanding 3D, fight sequences, character development and comedy saved the day though, making ""Hercules"" a passable summer movie that should have grand success on video.",1406851200,134,2090,4.832402234636872
2509359,3,B000E372ZY,"After I left the movie theater all I could think was ""There was so much potential there"". I was so excited for this movie when I saw the trailer, I mean I am infatuated with Greek mythology and all the tales that come with it. After a horrible version of Hercules staring Kellen Lutz, this movie had my attention and hopes that it would redeem Hercules' name. The acting was pretty solid, even the actors I have never heard of did a great job. Johnson is the perfect person to play this mythological character, I mean he has the body you would imagine a demi-god having. The issue lies in the plot. Instead of showing us the battles of all the horrifying creatures that Hercules ""supposedly"" killed, they throw him and his group of Mercs into the role as trainers for the Thracian army. It just seemed to me that it could have been more epic. There are some entertaining action scenes for sure, however they seemed too clich most of the time. I suppose it is worth a watch, but for me it does not stack up to other action flicks that have come out recently.",1406764800,3,1057,4.370558375634518

2509362,4,B000E372ZY,"This year of 2014, there have been two Hercules movies.  The first, The Legend of Hercules, was decent, though it offered nothing unique.  This one starring Dwayne Johnson has more development of the theme of courage and more unexpected plot twists.  I approach most movies without a lot of expectations, knowing Ill find a movie somewhat rewarding if the values, writing, and editing are good.  This one gave me more enjoyment than I expected.  Hercules is the natural choice for an ancient superhero.  When you add themes of justice and the rights of the people and make that Hercules cause to fight for, he becomes as relatable as Superman, Batman, or Spiderman.  One of the strengths of this superhero movie is that its not primarily about supernatural powers but about the meaning of courage.  Hercules does have superhuman strength in this, but his victory always depends on triumphing over internal struggles first.  His powers don't come very naturally, so hes easier to relate to.  Hercules in this movie is more like John Henry, the American railroad worker superhero, than like a demigod.  In fact, the movie goes to extra lengths to convince you hes just a man, not a god.  I feel like it developed the internal struggles of a superhero better than most superhero movies, and that made it more rewarding when he succeeds.

When Hercules is in action on this movie, it feels truly awesome because he has to work so hard to produce that superhuman strength.  The movie does a great job with the pitched battle scenes.  It is as rewarding to watch them as some of the great battles on the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The movies intensity level is a bit stronger than I like, but it really helps that the movie stays PG-13 instead of indulging in graphic gore.

I like the casting also, of John Hurt as the king who hires Hercules to fight his enemy, and Hercules several friends, and Hercules, played by Dwayne Johnson.  His personality is such that he doesn't need to express much in order to reveal his character's mood or attitude.  There are some touches of humor that add a lot, yet not so much that the movie gets silly.

The lasting satisfaction for me is how the Greek value of physique gets fused with the Biblical value of servant leadership, exerting courage to protect those who are weak.  Hercules has a strong moral code on this.  Sometimes it works well to have an antihero like Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Caribbean) be the center of a story, but that usually makes the movie more silly.  Theres no blurry gray line between good and evil in this movie, but thats not a weakness; its the natural way to present a character with such brute force as Hercules.

(The intensity is the only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.)",1406592000,105,2751,4.636363636363637
