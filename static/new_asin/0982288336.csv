7795747,5,0982288336,"This is an outstanding DVD on the topic of evaluating caregivers/parent.  Anyone who works in Child Welfare or who is called on to evaluate parents and families should get this DVD.  It's use of lecture, PowerPoint, and video clips of actual evaluation sessions make this an informative and highly useful DVD for mental health professionals.  Dr. Becker-Weidman presents detailed material about methodologies to evaluate parent's state of mind with respect to attachment, parent reflective abilities, insightfulness, commitment, and other important issues.  After watching this DVD I came away with a lot of practical and immediately useable material.
