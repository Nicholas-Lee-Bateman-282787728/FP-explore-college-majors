8356236,5,B0028G3PFG,"I first seen the 10 minute short of this documentary on GM Kosteniuk's website, and I ordered the full version. If a person reads her biography ""Diary of a Chess Queen"" in conjunction with this DVD, it will become even more of an emotional investment on behalf of the viewer as she makes her way to the Chess Olympus. I wish the 1978 World Chess Championship between Karpov and Korchnoi could have been captured the way this was done. Nevertheless, I think anyone interested in the history of the game should buy this DVD of her here or  from GM Kosteniuk directly.  It is important to support achievements like what she has done for the motivation of future female chess players. Not only this, it is important to purchase DVDs like this so that in the future other great rises in the Chess world may be put on film for the preservation of Chess history.  This was filmed well. Imagine watching a film being narrated by  Kasparov, Karpov or Spassky on their world chess championship victories. Now chess fans and players have a chance to own a DVD  narrated by a living World Chess Champion. While it is tempting to only be curious to see a beauty play chess this well, I think after watching her enough, a fan comes to really appreciate the work ethic involved and the exciting way she handles the game. If you like Tal or Shirov's games, you will enjoy GM Kosteniuk's style of play as well. If you own a copy of ""The Soviet School of Chess"" compare GM Kosteniuk's games in comparison to the way female players games went near the end of that book. Or even look at the Women's World Chess Championship games from 1984. GM Kosteniuk's play is enough to make that look like a skittles room blitz off between a couple of class A players.",1378425600,8,1736,4.481012658227848
