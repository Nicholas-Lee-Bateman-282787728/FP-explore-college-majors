8288289,4,B001CO1Z20,Information presented follows what one would expect from an In-Fisherman series.  Good information along with a pretty decent price.  This is the kind of video that reminds you how to target species that traditionally get overlooked as you 'graduate' to larger fish.  It can be helpful when grooming the next generation to become interested in fishing.,1327968000,,352,5.25
8288290,4,B001CO1Z20,Like all In-Fisherman video productions this one was educational and entertaining. A good overall view of panfishing as a general topic. I was hoping for a bit more detailed coverage of perch fishing but... The video delivers what it promises. I enjoyed it and will watch it again.,1291680000,,281,4.875
8288291,4,B001CO1Z20,Good video. I love to panfish. If you are like me then you enjoy panfisnin but I don't enjoy the snowy winter so I watch videos by the fire. Infisherman always makes a good quality video and this one is no exception. Takes a snowy day and makes it alittle brighter.,1289520000,,265,4.215686274509804
