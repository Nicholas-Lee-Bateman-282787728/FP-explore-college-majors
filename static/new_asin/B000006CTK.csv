I have never been so amazed, delighted, frightened, amused, surprised, love-struck and nostalgic (in that order) as I was when I saw ""Ice Cream Man."" Watching this little piece of cinematic gold is like watching real life. You feel like you're actually IN THE MOVIE! A must-see for anyone who has even half the sense to drink milk from a dairy goat.",1076544000,,404,4.625
7904260,5,B000006CTK,"This is by far the greatest movie of all time!!  Put Star Wars in the trash can.  Flush the Godfather down the toilet...If you want to see acting at its best, check out clint howards, unblemished performance in this brilliant masterpiece. Small Paul will not easily be forgotten, as will not his friends Tuna, Racer, and the other kid....So in conclusion, ""There are no bad days...only happy...happy days..."" Buy this or you are retarded.",975974400,3,438,4.905405405405405
7904261,5,B000006CTK,"The plot may not have had any depth to it, but it is well worth watching.  The acting IS bad, and the budget was as low as low gets (they had those  fake sunflowers that spin in the wind in place of real ones. even the  police cant tell the difference) but it all adds up to make a hilarious  movie, I swear!",969235200,2,308,3.8412698412698414
7904262,3,B000006CTK,"All righty, I admit, B-Movies are great. I love them. The reason I love  them is because they normaly have a thin plot and the concept is utterly  dumb unlike other 'mainstreem' movies who try to pass their movie as  'regular'.
However this movie, makes the B-Movie genere look passing.  The movie is about an ice cream man who goes on a killing spree for no  reason. OK, not to give the plot away {HA HA}, but in the start a young  pre-ice cream boy sees an elder ice cream man get shot in a drive by. There  is no thought put into why Clint Howards character kills people after the  senceless killing.
The acting by the children was horrible. The power  squad was so unneeded and the barrets they wore were stupid.
I love  B-Movies but if this was the first movie someone saw in the genere, well I  doubt they would like them. If you want to see a good B-Movie, see a movie  like Bug Buster or even the Police Academy Series.
Sorry if I am a little  hostile but, I went to my local movie store, I saw a Clint Howard film, I  though ""Ticks"", and I rented it.  I sort of wasted my money, but  atleast I could write a review and add more to my name.
Have A Nice  LiFE!
