8430911,4,B004IN20XK,"ZHONG WU YEN is a romantic drama that centers on the touchy issue of where beauty resides. The hero Xi Huan is an arrogant and conceited jerk who unabashedly divides all women into two categories--those that are beautiful whom he chases and those who are ugly whom he insults. This game of superficiality works well enough for years and he sees no need to change. Into his life steps Zhong Wu Yen, an otherwise attractive woman with a large red port wine birthmark spread across her face. Xi Huan mocks her mercilessly and she silently endures the taunts since she has loved him for years. There is a parallel subplot involving Ying Chun a drop dead gorgeous model who also loves him. In Ying Chun's case she had been an overweight totally unattractive teen who decided that extensive plastic surgery was the only way she could ever win his love. Much of the film revolves around melodramatic power plays that decide who gets to be the CEO of a large and powerful cosmetics firm. Several reviewers have complained that they were offended by the nastiness of Xi Huan during the first half of a thirty-one episode run. They further complained that Wu Yen refused to accept the courtship of another man who probably would have been a better match. The problem here is that viewers tend to judge the merit of a film by the character of one of the leads. Xi Xuan changes slowly during the course of the film as he has to learn that beauty is indeed only skin deep. He must hit rock bottom enduring numerous crises before he can admit that Wu Yen has a beauty all her own. Wu Yen's rival (Ying Chun) must travel the same tormented path of Xi Xuan only in her case her maniacal desire to transform herself surgically from an ugly duckling to Snow White glosses over the need to focus less on her own looks than on the hopes of Xi Xuan. Though ZHONG WU YEN suffers from excessive melodrama, the metamorphosis of the trio of leads causes all concerned to redefine not only what is beauty but also what is enduring love.
