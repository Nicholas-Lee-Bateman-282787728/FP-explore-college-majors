3894793,5,B002BIULPI,"We take Baby Noah and our daughters jumper everywhere we go. It's amazing how our 6 month old daughter responds to this DVD.  It makes her smile and giggle, and we love it!  It was given to her as a gift when she was 4 months old and we watch it at LEAST once a day!  Highly recommend getting it!",1298678400,3,296,3.9
3894794,5,B002BIULPI,"We got this for my daughter when she was about 5 months old.  She loved it then, and she loves it now, at 18 months.  The sequences aren't too long, so they keep her attention, and she loves dancing to the music.  She identifies most of the animals now, and even remembers which animals go with which music when we listen to the Einstein CDs.  We have given this as a gift several times as well, and the other parents and kids also seem to love it.",1297555200,,448,4.114942528735632
3894795,5,B002BIULPI,We bought this for my 7 month old son for Christmas and it has been awesome. He loves all the animals and babies in the movie. I am able to actually get several things done around the house while he watches (rare thing in our house). Normally I will start a video for him and be able to have five minutes before he is crawling away but he seems to love this movie and is mesmorized by everything about it. Definiately a keeper!,1295136000,,427,4.156626506024097
3894796,5,B002BIULPI,"I have twin 7 month olds and they have been watching this movie and baby Neptune since they were 3 months old!! I can play them over and over and over until they either get hungry or fall asleep or when the credits start up they start crying. It's amazing how much they love these 2 movies and they are great when I am trying to get chores done,,, they'll rock in their infant/toddler rockers just giggling and are totally content enjoying the show. Based on reviews I just purchased the Baby Mozart.  The boys don't ever seem to tire of the 2 we have, but Mom is ready for a change!!  ha ha",1284940800,6,591,4.175438596491228
3894797,5,B002BIULPI,"My daughter first saw baby noah about a week ago (she is 11 weeks old now) and she loves it! She laughs and coos and smiles throughout the whole movie and actually gets mad when it is over. Baby einstein movies are great for getting a little quiet time when you have a small child. They worked with my other daughter, who is now 10, when she was younger too.",1282867200,,358,4.128571428571429

3894799,5,B002BIULPI,"I love the Baby Einstein products, the DVDs for young children. They are exciting and so interesting. And they teach while holding a child's interest. I give them as presents. One of the young mothers wrote me a thank you note She said thanks for giving me a few minutes to be able to do something while my son watches in awe, captured by sounds, colors and the animals. Very entertaining while being very educational.",1270252800,,418,4.586666666666667
