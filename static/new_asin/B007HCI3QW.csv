5086072,1,B007HCI3QW,"Too old a movie for my taste.  Robert Goulet I never considered a very good actor.  As a singer, he could hold his own.",1416528000,,119,3.9166666666666665
5086073,4,B007HCI3QW,"Even if some of the acting is not the best, and some improbable situations were shown, this is a remarkably good movie that will grab your attention from the start to the end.  As the action progresses you realize that the plot is well developed and ingenious.  I suspect that many ideas for the storyline were taken from real life incidents and stories from the real underground which of course only makes perfect sense.

Also, the locations in this movie were very well chosen and interesting in themselves, as somebody commented.

Because it was also entertaining, I will give it four instead of three, in order to encourage others to ""give it a try"".",1415836800,4,654,4.7105263157894735

5086077,5,B007HCI3QW,Absolutely delighted with the service and the movie. It was made in my hometown and have been searching for it for years.,1399680000,,121,4.545454545454546
5086078,4,B007HCI3QW,"A movie starring Robert Goulet in the leading role, and a dramatic one, at that, deserves some attention.  Before this 1970 World War II actioner, Goulet had only appeared in ""Honeymoon Hotel"" and ""I'd Rather Be Rich,"" both light comedy.  And he did a lot of television like the Carol Burnett Show and his own series ""The Blue Light"" and most memorably sang ""If Ever Would I Leave You"" in the Broadway production of ""Camelot.""  I was really happy to discover this film recently as an MGM/UA Limited Edition DVD-R as I think Goulet deserved the exposure.  And it was good.  Cast opposite him is Daniele Gaubert the star of Radley Metzger's ""Camille 2000"" in which she was one of Metzger's most beautiful heroines.  Again she shows she has plenty of talent.  The screenplay by Ron Bishop and Andy Lewis isn't bad from a story by Marc L. Roberts and Ron Bishop, but at times becomes implausible in spite of itself.  A lot of the movie is filmed during nighttime scenes with bad lighting.  It begins hard to make out and ends crucially with it not totally clear what had happened, which to me was the biggest drawback and it was also rather poorly played by most of the cast due to the director, Arthur H. Nadel letting static takes get by him.  I think he could have gotten a better performance from Goulet which is a pity that he didn't.  I don't think Goulet turned up again in a movie until 1980.  He is at his prime here.  Produced by Jules Levy and Arthur Gardner, filmed in Color By Deluxe.  The DVD-R is presented in 16 x 9 Letterbox.  Film has a few blemishes, but as with most MGM/UA Limited Edition product, supposedly ""the best source material is used.""  Goulet and Gaubert have a good chemistry.  And there is the scene where a German officer makes a pass at him...",1339113600,7,1774,4.4766355140186915

5086080,5,B007HCI3QW,"personally - ANYTHING with Robert Goulet in it is a winner in my book.  So, yes, I was VERY happy to have this to add to my collection.  So sorry he's gone.",1443398400,,156,3.84375
5086081,4,B007HCI3QW,"Amazon's picture is misleading as this film is a 1970's release in colour (not b/w). I enjoy resistance/spy movies so gave it a go and was pleasently surprised. It is lower budget, no huge name stars, but it is very watchable, just get past the dodgy accents (bad French and the Priest was Irish, not surprising at was shot on location in Ireland), good use of locations considering it was not shot in France and it draws you in, if you stay with it.
Very good for what it is and a nice surprise to see Roger Delgado, for me the definitive ""Master"" from 1970's Doctor Who.",1442534400,,572,4.355140186915888
