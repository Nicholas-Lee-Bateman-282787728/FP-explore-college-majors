1731477,5,B000069DMN,"This amazing movie is a look at the ways that a man, the protagonist Jay (Mark Rylance) once-married, and a once fairly conventional husband and dad,  can utterly fall apart in divorce,  the heartbreaking ways he might try to put a life back together, and the ache for connection and communion that can't necessarily be soothed - within or without ""happy"" marriages.
By now the plot and the fact of its depiction of acts of sexual intercourse are well-known. There is a woman, Claire. She shows up at Jay's door, Wednesdays at 2 PM. We don't know anything about her at first - just that once she's in his apartment, her clothes (and his) come off.  The five to ten minutes of intense once-weekly sex on Jay's  apartment floor is no less important for being quick and wordless;  it is  a sort of a pact between the couple, and their shared illness, really.  But it can't, ultimately,  do the trick, and the film succeeds - unmoralistically - in showing us how and why. The urge to find either oblivion or ecstasy - whether via alcohol or sex or other means - fuels the couple. There are amazing surprises along the way, via a script that is utterly believable and natural.
In fact, every  aspect of the protagonist Jay's life is in fact shown  harshly, ""graphically,"" whether it is his hectic job tending bar, his messy, depressing apartment (further evidence that he has lost his moorings), his several  friends, or his frantic travels through London. (The camera chases him, and he is chasing her). We're by turns frustrated, confused, and focused. One's attention never wanders during this story.
Children (Jay's and Claire's) are used well in this film. They can tell the truth, and they do. They use the word ""love"" - and the adults in this movie really can't.  In several scenes Jay is at his ex-wife's apartment, bathing his beautiful little sons. He lies on what was the marriage bed and makes a sort of sad and frantic fetish of his ex-wife's underwear, and is interrupted by his son, who needs his help.  We are never asked to be voyeurs, but witnesses to a lot of sadness, distress - and the difficulty, really, of the attainment of happiness.
This is an astonishing film about broken hearts - and what people  might do to try to mend them.",1010188800,329,2250,4.6206030150753765
1731478,5,B000069DMN,"One of the years best films.  Chereau's ""Intimacy "" is deserving of admiration for it's gutsy and honest handling of an aspect of human behavior that is so sublime and personal, it often goes undiscussed.  Characters are well rounded and the acting goes unnoticed.  Men who are willing to take an honest look at themselves will view this film and see a self-portrait.  Like Allen's ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" this is a title i cannot wait to add to my DVD collection and i urge anyone who has a serious appetite for cinema to devour this one.",1008633600,6,541,4.546391752577319
1731479,1,B000069DMN,"As a writer who often deals with themes of desire and intimacy [The Wheel of Desire and Other Intimate Hauntings (Writers Club Press, 2000)], I had high hopes for Patrice Chereau's Intimacy. But I was sorely disappointed. I am a divorced man who lived through the miasma of dating before remarrying. I wanted to identify with Jay (Mark Rylance). After all, he is an average-looking Everyman trying to cope with loneliness in a cold world. The crude and cruel circumstances under which he chooses to live, however, make identification impossible. It is hard to identify with squalor. Yes, I know the squalor of his cold-water flat symbolizes the squalor of his soul, but if we are to identify with someone like him we must see him struggle against such deprivations. Jay seems to embrace the filth of his life and seeks to spread it to others, beginning with Claire (Kerry Fox), the woman who drops by each Wednesday to have quick anonymous sex, and continuing with her husband (Timothy Spall).
The film fails on several counts. First, it is far too long for its subject matter; my wife left the theater before the end, telling me she'd rather wait in our car (in Buffalo in December) than sit through the end. The 120 minute running time includes five sex scenes and WAY too much talk.  Second, there are too many extraneous characters. Jay's friend Victor shows us someone even worse off than Jay, and co-worker Ian philosophizes too much, but neither man adds texture to Jay's life or the film. Her friend Betty is too dim to brighten Claire's life. Only her husband Andy has anything pivotal to say to her, but in what is the film's best line, even he doesn't know her well enough to hurt her. Ironically, although Jay is the first man she wanted to be something with in a long time, she doesn't let him get to know her.
The sex scenes, while certainly explicit, are unerotic. The characters say little or nothing as they couple on the floor in Jay's dirty digs. Of course, all that is intended to show their lack of intimacy, but we get the point within five minutes. (It is an irony worth noting that while Rylance and Fox are acting the parts of uncomfortable casual lovers, they must have reached some level of their own intimacy to portray people unable to attain it.)
A better film would have told the same story in half the time with three principal characters and no sledge-hammer symbolism. His flat needn't have been such a stomach-churning mess, and even people who meet only for sex do engage in conversation. Ask any adult. Most of us have been there, in a casual relationship that one party eventually wanted to be more or in bed trying to overcome discomfort with small talk. Jay and Claire aren't even trying. Intimacy fails because it asks us to recall our own lost relationships and identify with characters and circumstances too far off the scope of our own personal radar. Despite wanting to say something, the film is surprisingly close-mouthed, the infamous fellatio scene notwithstanding.",1008547200,9,3014,4.730038022813688
1731480,2,B000069DMN,"The French have a very liberal and blase' attitude towards sex and love.  Check out ""Venus Beauty Institute"" or ""Blue"" to see what I mean. Both of these films are refreshing in their attitudes especially where love and relationships are concerned.  It was with this knowledge that I approached Patrice Chereau's ""Intimacy,"" what I had hoped would be a frenchman's take, set in England, on these subjects.  Imagine my surprise when what started out as a ""Last Tango in Paris"" type of film metamorphosed into ""Secrets and Lies."" Jay (Mark Rylance) and Claire (Kerry Fox) begin a very adult, very sexual, every Wednesday tryst that works for Claire but not for Jay at least for very long. Jay becomes obsessed with Claire's ""real life"" and sets upon a quest to find out all he can about her even to the point of insinuating himself with her husband,Andy (Timothy Spall) and her young son. Jay says ""She (Claire) understands something that I don't..."" What he means is that Claire can separate what she and Jay have together from what she has with her family. She is the more amoral and adult of the two and Jay, who prides himself on being sophisticated, turns out to be the immature jerk.  There's a horrendous scene with Claire's husband in which Jay, through innuendo and inference, reveals the affair that could have been snipped from Mike Newell's ""Secrets and Lies""  or ""Othello,"" for tht matter, with Jay as Iago and Andy as Othello. Ugly. Kerry Fox, Mark Rylance and Timothy Spall (who was actually in ""Secrets and Lies"") do excellent jobs but to what end?  ""Intimacy"" is a cheat: a morality tract masquerading as a contemporary, honest, adult film. Boo.",1003708800,6,1659,4.783216783216783
1731481,1,B000069DMN,"Realism is a tricky thing to pull off in cinema, and nothing is less realistic when it doesn't work, but 'Intimacy''s big claim is to Authenticity, particularly in the now notorious sex scene.  'Intimacy' - about a bar manager and an aspiring actress meeting once a week for anonymous sex - deliberately opposes the prevailing cinematic trend towards CGI effects devoid of human interaction by asserting the Real, the Raw.  this isn't play-acting, fake, something we can forget about and dismiss as just a film - The Actors Are Really Doing It.  The title doesn't refer to the characters, whose inability to achieve intimacy it snidely undercuts: it refers to the pact between the director, actors and the audience, the promise that we're going to achieve a new level of emotional intimacy never before revealed on film, one that breaks the cosy boundary between make-belief and real-life.
Ironically, this intimacy (for which we must take the filmmakers' word, as the scenes seem as simulated as any other film, the one nuzzling... scene rather coy compared to 'In the Realm of the Senses' or 'Romance') undercuts any attempt at realism or film-viewer empathy.  It is quite clear that we're not watching two characters, but two actors - their movements and grappling are stiff, stilted and self-conscious, as if aware that what they are doing is taboo-busting and, in a sweetly English way, are embarrassed about it.
This gaucheness can't be excused as the characters' - director Chereau gets all self-reflexive and has a scene where Claire, a drama teacher, criticises two actors who are trying out a love scene.  This intellectual bad faith reminds us that we are not watching an English film, but a French one - when we first meet Jay, he is listening to the Clash's 'London Calling'.  This may suggest how out of date or trapped in the past the character is, but imagine an English or American filmmaker showing a corresponding Frenchman listening to 'Je ne regrette rien'.
Too often the modes of French art cinema meet the content of British social realism and fail to gel - the unconvincing dialogue; the phoney mannerisms and delivery; the bogus idea that men will bare their emotional souls in macho English pubs; the 'party' scene like so many orgies from 60s European films.  The style is refried Wong Kar-Wai, Carine Adler and Dogme, with the abrupt editing, restless camerawork and close-ups spliced with the odd freeze-frame at 'pregnant' moments.
At one point Jay says he can never tell, when at the theatre, whether the acting is good or bad.  I had the same problem here.  Because I found the situations contrived and the dialogue untrue, I couldn't believe in the characters, I didn't recognise them, they didn't teach me anything new about myself or anyone else.  There was no joy in the body, or even exploration of the body: this was a typical French view of English 'love-making' - quick, grubby, brutal, joyless, tangles of wobbly, sickly-white flesh.  But they did it for Real, so it must be Great Acting.",1001030400,17,3029,4.896484375

Fox is one of my favorites and I'd probably like anything she's in, as long as she's speaking English. :-)  I think she's definitely one of the best as she always very believably transforms herself into her characters.

I don't really want to say to much about this movie, but when Kerry Fox went down, yes I said go down on that man. My eyes popped out. I have never seen that in a movie before.

1731487,5,B000069DMN,"I'd heard about this movie through word of mouth (Amanda Palmer recommended it highly, and I love her taste so there you go), and it was everything I thought it would be -- emotionally draining, beautifully filmed, and powerful on so many levels. Mark Rylance and Kerry Fox give us stellar turns as the once-a-week lovers who meet in a grotty flat for sex that somehow manages to be passionate and detached at the same time, and when Rylance starts wanting to know more about Fox (almost against his will), the movie becomes something amazing. Timothy Spall is absolutely marvelous as Fox's cuckolded husband, and the scene where he and Rylance play billiards and talk about cheating spouses cannot be missed.

Yes, there's nudity, and a fair amount of simulated sex, and kudos has to be given to Rylance for playing what must have been a physiologically challenging role. But the contrast of these two people, who are so physically open with each other and yet so emotionally cut off, is a beautiful essay on the problems of intimacy.

Such a true nature of human intimacy. Such a beautiful and a sad story at the same time. Completely symbolic movie, it has so much teaching, so many lessons...

There is the most beautiful moment of the movie and one of the most erotic moment in the history of cinematography - the moment of falling in love, gloating, being in the moment of beauty...

1731493,3,B000069DMN,"Can a midlife crisis be fulfilled with sex alone?  To save you time from watching this movie the short answer to that question is ""no"".  Protagonists are Jay, divorced father of two young boys who not so long ago simple walked out on his family for no other reason but the fact that he was unhappy.  Claire, his lover who he meets on Wednesday afternoons is married woman, an actress and a mother of a young boy.  We do not know how these two met, but we do know that they are pulled to each other.  Their sex is raw and immediate, there is not much foreplay.  Jay does not even strike me as a good lover, his hair is receding, his nails are too long, his apartment where he and his lover meet and make love is appauling much like Claire's own husband.  We see her husband who is a cab driver, well aware that his wife is ""uneven"" and quite tolerant of it becuase after all - he loves her.  Both Jay and Claire have their dreams crushed.  He is a failed musician, she is a failed actress.  Their relationships with their family is strained one and it is not due to faults of their long suffering spouses or children.  Both of them suffer from misery that is self imposed.  Worse of all, they have no direction, goal or ambition; they simply drift thru life and the only way they feel intense is when they make love.  But sex alone cannot sustain them and they both know it.  They will have to find a better way to define themselves if they wish to rid of emptiness, unhappiness without cause and silent rage directed towards people around them.

The female lead has chosen to stay on in a seemingly good marriage, and be eaten up emotionally inside, even though she eventually ended up sharing this affair.

1731500,4,B000069DMN,"A worthy movie for adults. The plot is a bit like ""Last Tango in Paris,"" with a man and woman accidentally meeting, then showing up one afternoon a week for some rabid sex, neither telling the other anything about themselves. The guy (Mark Rylance) decides to follow the woman (Kerry Fox), discovers she's married and works in a shabby theater, and is married to a not-overly-bright man who has too many chins and a puffy lower lip like Alfred Hitchcock's. Both of the men want her and she decides to stay with her husband and children. End of plot.

This is about as deglamorized a movie as has recently appeared. At first, both Rylance and Fox look like the kind of people who are right up there in the first rank of the third rate. He runs a bar. He's balding, skinny, always needs a shave, and lives alone in some seedy dump that looks like a Soviet-era zheloy dom. She first appears with her hair up, working-class style, glumly groomed. And the two of them are photographed -- dressed or otherwise -- in a way that makes their skin seem to emit a pale sickly blue. Your first thought is liable to be a red flag: This is going to be one depressing flick.

Then as the plot develops -- hard as it is to follow in its details -- we come to know them surprisingly well, the two of them. Rylance takes on a certain pathetic charm with his scarred eyebrow and occasional stutter. And Kerry Fox lets her hair down, literally, and we can see the self-knowledge and the desire in her big blue New Zealand eyes. They become likable.

In many ways the most admirable person important to the story is Timothy Spall as Kerry's husband, the Hitchcockian cab driver. He's not particularly bright and he trusts people a bit too much. And, man, he looks unprepossessing. But he's gregarious, generous, good-natured, and as harmless as a child. When he discovers that Rylance and Fox have been boffing each other, what does he do? Does he pick up a gun and spray lead. Does he do a plastic-surgery number on Rylance's face? Nope. He goes round to Rylance's bar, has a beer, and tells Rylance that he loves his wife. And that every day he loves her more. Later, when Fox prompts him to ventilate his anger over her affair, all he can come up with is something like, ""I don't care about that s***! What really bothers me is that you're a lousy actress and will never be anything else!"" When he's done shouting, she replies, ""You don't even know how to hurt me."" There are other characters in the story too -- children, an ex-wife, somebody named Victor with a Scots accent, and a gay French bartender who philosophizes a lot. (I wonder if the writers had a particular model in mind.) Next to Kerry's husband, the French guy is about the most articulate of the bunch.

But that's the problem with the movie. I was frankly lost at times. I honestly don't know how Spall's character found out about his wife's affair. Evidently she confirmed suspicions he already had, but since the scene doesn't appear on screen we have to guess. In fact, if the love scenes are speechless, the rest of the script isn't much better. More than once a character says to another, ""I can't understand a word you're saying."" Sometimes I couldn't either. ""We shouldn't be gay because someone died."" ""Nobody died."" ""I died once. It was the only day I could tell the whole truth."" I think we're in ""Last Year at Marienbad"" territory here. A shouting match between Rylance and Kerry in the basement theater made no sense to me at all. It reminded me of my marriage.

I recommend it though. It's a rare movie made for adults. It's a challenging drama about lives that are either half empty or half full, depending on how you look at them. The ending is sad, but we are at least left with the hope that these characters can mend their tattered lives and get on with things.",1173398400,11,3830,4.481375358166189

1731505,5,B000069DMN,"I thought that this comes out as a movie by a Muslim considering the ways of the West and finding them bitter sweet at best.  Women often try to take on an additional man to prove to themselves that the ennui that they feel at home is not their fault alone. What happens is that they need a theory of life in a religiously, socially or nationally approved set of rules and management details.  Without such a code we find out that the men get along better without the women around save that they are vile and know that something is missing.  The take on feminism is that British men can't bear the responsibilities that women regularly carry out in respecting the spouse's career.  A woman has to be talented but a man can be just himself.

My suggestion to the characters would be a bit of humility and less rage about what they have little ability to change.  They are both people of worth.  Perhaps back to music for Jay to perform, manage or teach and perhaps writing or directing would suit Claire.",1126051200,5,1003,4.418478260869565
1731506,3,B000069DMN,"""Intimacy"", a film about two middle-aged people, Jay and Claire,  who meet for sex every wednesday, is difficult to digest as a whole. It's as if the film needs to be divided into two distinct sections: the scripted melodrama and the graphic sex scenes.

Let's start with the scripted scenes. In terms of the script and story, ""Intimacy"" is pretty mediocre. The main characters, although confused, neurotic, trapped and lonely, are still really not all that interesting or believable, and the supporting characters are mostly irritating and often incoherent. It is interesting that the most believable, touching and tender scenes in the film don't involve the two main characters at all, but rather involve interactions between adults and children. One scene in particular is especially poignant; when Jay is at the theatre, confronting and chastising Claire, when suddenly her son appears and he's instantly transformed into a sincere and vulnerable father again.

As for the sex scenes ... with so many films filled with contrived, choreographed, robotic sexuality, it was interesting to see sex depicted so realistically in a film. At times visceral, awkward, vulnerable and sad, the brief sex scenes probably show more of the dynamics behind Jay and Claire's relationship than most of the rambling, pretentious dialogue in the rest of the film.",1119916800,32,1348,5.26046511627907
1731507,2,B000069DMN,"Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the ""desperate"", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore.",1111536000,28,694,5.318181818181818

What I then saw were two white bodies, moving together like Rodin's sculptures beautifully united in their dance of desire...There was no artificial smiles or styled muscles, natural true sex with sweating and sounds of exercise, and the relief afterwards, tenderness, not many words were exchanged ...

It was a film tremendously moving for the truth it showed, starting with the sex on the floor, pictures of the protagonist Jay smoking on the toilet in a bathroom filled with fungi (men usually do not clean up, that is so real)..

Reality without cosmetic everywhere: the brown, grey blocks of London suburbs, Jay's friend Victor, a sweating alcoholic wearing a moist but elegant jacket, wonderfully realistically played, too, Claire, in contrast to her type wearing once elegant black much too expensive underwear, which highlighted the image of her being a bad actress..(she played that role wonderfully, showing how good she really is..)..

Mark Rylance was superb in showing so much vulnerability, having had to leave the family, the boys he very much loved, the wife he still waited to show him something more than just detest(there is a rather naturalistic masturbation scene, after his wife had turned away from him in bed sleeping like their dead relationship..)...So much following, a great playing Marianne Faithful, Timothy Spall wonderful, all these naturalistic characters at the Pub or at the actors school...

1731511,4,B000069DMN,"Patrice Chereau is a unique director - he understands film as well as opera staging and goes for the edgy despite what the critics disclaim.  INTIMACY is a bizarre story that appears more like an extended dark dream than it does a study of people in their waking hours.  Note that most of the story takes place in shadows, and for very good reason.  Jay (Mark Rylance) is a divorced man who quite by mistake discovers Claire (Kerry Fox) when he happens into a raunchy little theater - Claire is playing in The Glass Menagerie and her real life seems nearly as crippled as her character's life.  Claire is married to a cheery fat Andy (Timothy Spall) who waits on her hand and foot, encouraging her minimal theatrical talents, while he unwittingly introduces his new found friend to his wife.  Jay and Claire quite without words begin a series of weekly trysts that are solely sexual releases.  When Jay begins to feel his emotions awakening, the story takes a turn and we are left watching how two people can meet, congeal, and taint their peripheral others.  The acting is first rate, including a fine gay character as portrayed by Phillipe Calvario, apparently drawing a parallel with the concept of one night stands encountered in the gay world with Jay and Claire's sex-for-sex-sake.  Yes, the film is dark, but that side of life deserves examination and for this viewer, the camera work, direction, music, and pacing by Chereau are  very apropos of the theme.  Worth watching as a sort of London version of Bertolucci's DREAMERS!",1091491200,17,1534,4.776515151515151
1731512,5,B000069DMN,"First off, this is not a movie for: 1. People with puritannical hangups about sex and nudity, 2. People with infantile and cliched notions of Romance and Relationships with capital R's, 3. People with kitschy expectations of what a ""pleasurable"" movie experience should be like, and 4. People with generally childlike, conformist perceptions of self and society.

 ""Intimacy"" is really about the LACK of real emotional intimacy, even in the midst of feverish physical intimacy between two randy strangers, not just in the all-too-familiar midst of the universal social theatre of conventional marriage with its elaborate playacting and mutually-agreed-upon delusions.

 It is above all about the emotional and cultural reality that all too many of us live in: abject isolation, emotional deadness, self-absorption and ego-glorification, raving desperation and desolation.

 The sex scenes are extremely realistic: instead of the usual cosmetized puppetry most often seen in film eroticism, we see two pale, flabby, clumsy and dysfunctional adults go at each other like mute rabbits, about 8 parts too-long-repressed libido and 2 parts actual skill.

 Yes, there is quite a bit of (gasp!) exposure of an (gasp!) uncircumsized (gasp!) male (gasp!) sex organ, including actual (gasp!) mouth-to-genital contact (to borrow the oh-so poetic language of the Starr Report) in (gasp!) both directions.

 There. Now if those stupendously mind-blowing, earth-shattering details do not knock you off of your rocking chair and leave you in a prolonged state of catatonia, you may well quite enjoy this film. True, the two main characters do not ever ride off into the sunset on a white horse with flower petals in their hair, but you probably guessed that one already.",1090627200,35,1755,5.395604395604396
1731513,3,B000069DMN,"Like other reviewers, I was disappointed in ""Intimacy"". I found that the film had very little to say in terms of why the two main characters (Mark Rylance and Kerry Fox) carried on such an unpleasant sexual relationship. Their weekly meetings in Rylance's grungy apartment for sex obviously indicated they each had deeper more emotional needs. But neither find what they are looking for. They are both frustrated, unhappy people with unfulfilling lives and blunt, crude sex grants them the temporary escape valve. However, it's obvious that the sex isn't really fulfilling either one of their needs. Rylance and Fox are good actors and Marianne Faithful is good as one of Fox's friends. But neither Fox nor Rylance is terribly attractive so their nude sex scenes aren't that interesting which makes the sadness and desperation of their acts even more downbeat. I agree the film is more explicit than most but without a good story and at least a positive note or two I can't really recommend it. If the film's intent is to show that an empty sexual relationship gets you nowhere, then it succeeds very well on that premise.",1086307200,19,1122,4.87958115183246
1731514,5,B000069DMN,"FOR MATURE ADULTS ONLY!
Some films from England, France, Italy and Germany are allowed to have such freedom and liberties to filming nude scenes whether they are in the natural state or erotic. Very few American actors in American films will allow themselves to be seen in the la natural state. Most American actors wear a ""willie"" stocking, an ""apron"" or ""clamshell"" or prefer a body double. However, those actors that agree in their contract to full frontal nudity know they will get more pay and a very handsome paycheck at that. Some have reached success very quickly. It could make a film successful too.
 Mark Rylance is not afraid to show his erotic side in this very adult film. This unrated DVD version pushes the red line of sex and nudity on screen as many scenes are NOT similated, in fact, INTIMACY (2001) is the first mainstream English language movie with unsimilated sex scenes to be passed uncut in Great Britain.
 The nudity is more shocking as the actor allows his uncut member to be seen in various stages. Only the oral act will be seen on the unrated, uncut version of this film. Definately on the Unrated (not an ""R"") DVD print.

1731515,3,B000069DMN,"Helmed by French auteur Patrice Chreau, who directed the vastly superior ""Queen Margot,"" the Birtish film ""Intimacy"" is a limp mess.  A man and woman carry on an illicit affair - they meet at his house Wednesday afternoons for sex.  They know nothing about each other, not even names.  Eventually, the man (Jay, played by Mark Rylance) finds himself wanting to know more about the woman (Claire, played by Kerry Fox), and he begins following her after their trysts.  What he finds out about her throws their relationship into question.
""Intimacy"" gained attention and notoriety for its explicit sex scenes (the R-rated version is also available, and these scenes are edited a great deal).  The sex scenes are among the most graphic ever seen in a mainstream movie, including a rather shocking scene where Fox fellates Rylance (everything is shown).  Ultimately, however, the sex scenes are quite un-sexy as the characters are so distant from each other.  A movie called ""Intimacy"" that lacks any intimacy whatsoever?  Sounds like an elaborate joke to me.
Aside from the explicitness of the sex scenes, the movie offers nothing new.  The characters are not well-delineated, and the conflicts are ill-defined.  On the plus side, Mark Rylance (""Angels & Insects"") and Kerry Fox (""Shallow Grave"") give good performances; however, it's rather disconcerting seeing such talented actors engaging in graphic sex scenes in a tepid movie.  Both actors have impressive backgrounds in the theater, and Rylance has acted extensively in Shakespearian productions at the Globe Theatre.  Shaking his spear indeed!
Extras: The DVD includes minimal extras: a photo gallery, brief bios of the actors, and the trailer.  A director commentary would be much appreciated, or even a commentary from the actors.  I'd love to hear what filming the explicit sex scenes was like!",1077753600,145,1851,5.188552188552189
1731516,2,B000069DMN,"For a while, this arty movie about sexual encounters between two strangers in London is actually quite intriging and unsettling. Unfortunately, after the first half hour the plot starts repeating its premise with little further development and moving at a slow, ungaging pace.
""Intimacy"" tries to deliver some food for thought about loneliness and despair in the modern world, focusing the relationship (or lack of it?) between a divorced man and a married woman that get intimate before they even manage to know each other properly. It`s an interesting idea, even if not completely original, but it could work better here.
The movie has some good elements: the acting is consistent (Mark Rylance is excellent), the soundtrack captivating, the photography well-crafted and the direction is moody and atmospheric enough. However, the character development isn`t that great, and the story loses its point halfway through, turning this project into a curious yet semi-failed picture. The sex scenes, which generated some controversy, aren`t really that strong or offensive, and director Patrice Chreau portrays those moments with a sense of style and cleverness (an harsher perspective was done in Catherine Breillat`s ridiculous ""Romance"").
""Intimacy"" has some guts and ideas, still it soon loses its strenght, approaching a bland and tepid development on its second half that fails to seduce.

For me, the revelation of this film was the SUPERB acting job of Marianne Faithfull. Granted, her character was the only truly innocent and interesting one in the film, but she found all the nuances of Betty...all the pathos and humanity.

Rylance delivers the goods (fnar,fnar) and Marion Faithfull does some acting too. Lurches from vulgar realism to melodrama and finally to some curious and somewhat unwarranted arthouse obtuseness. What was all that waffle about ""what was it like when you died?""
The explicitness rather defeats the whole point of acting. Cue boring anecdote about Olivier and Hoffman on the set of 'Marathon Man'? Nah, I'll let you off. Did we need the one for the road? Maybe it was a rare authentic moment but I questioned why the director wanted me to stand by the door watching. Five seconds of truth is still truth.

1731520,2,B000069DMN,"""Intimacy"" was awarded Golden Bear Prize at Berlin Film Festival in 2001, beating the contenders including ""Traffic.""  Considering the fact that this film festival previously gave this prestigious award to such films as ""Sense and Sensibility"" ""Thin Red Line"" ""Rainman"" ""Magnolia"" and this year ""Spirited Away,"" Hayao Miyazaki's critically acclaimed animated film, my expectation was naturally very high.
But they misjudged.  ""Intimacy"" simply doesn't deserve that.  Everyone talks about now much discussed graphic sex scenes, but the film doesn't give anything new or original beside that.  And as to sex, didn't the judges at Berlin see those films like ""Last Tango in Paris"" or ""Ai no Corrida (In the Realm of the Senses"")""?  The latter one is much more graphic, I tell you.
And some people rightly pointed out that ""Intimacy"" is actually about humans' loneliness.  Yes, but pointing out that is one thing; to really evaluate that is another.  For all its intention, the director only presented clithe-ridden characters.  Opening with a bleak sex scene, the film dives into bleakest relations between lovers, husband and wife, and friends, but what we see is painfully long dialogues that do not reveal anything to us at all.  Look at how Jay the protagonist keeps on talking to Andy in a bar; or Claire in  her acting class.  They indicate that they are lonely, certainly, but nothing else.  It's like a cypher or traffic sign -- ""THEY ARE LONELY.""  Yes, I know that.  Everyone knows that.  But HOW?
Here we have a saving grace: Timothy Spall, playing Andy, taxi-driver who is apparently content with his life, but somehow knows something is wrong with his life.  When we see him as Claire's self-satisfied husband, we feel she must be certainly craving something sexually in Jay or something else.  She might be frustrated with his smug attitude, and we feel that, especailly in the final fight scene in a cab.  But even skillful Spall cannot save this mess of the script, which indulges in its own pretentious ideas on sex and human relationships.  I wanna ask the writer and the director -- ""Do you really know what you are doing?""  I don't think so.
With the exception of Timothy Spall, the acting lacks subtle nuance that is required in this emotional kind of film.  Kerry Fox is not bad though slightly overacting, but less effective  is Mark Rylance, whose emotinal expression seems to rely on his twitching of his face.  I know he is an actor mainly working for stage, and his style tells it all; his acting, good-looking as it is, seems too one-noted for this subject matter.  His style  is suitable for the stage, but I doubt his casting here is really a good decision.
If you want to explore the loneliness of married life, or women-men relationship, read ""Madame Bovary"" or ""Anna Karenina.""  They are cheaper, but more profound.",1014681600,10,2844,4.897489539748954

7965421,1,B000069DMN,"Is it art? Maybe. Is it graphic? Yes. Is it obscene? No. Is it pornographic? Yes, in some scenes I think it is.

If my fictional pal Holden Caulfield saw this film I think he would likely comment, ""What a bunch of phonies."" In the past 20 years we have come to expect, even demand nudity in film and on TV. We didn't used to. It's hard to imagine Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in a nude bed scene. Or to watch Scarlett and Rhett race nude up the grand staircase of Tara to cement their love with a serious of magnified grunts. So we have learned to make excuses.

Somehow Ms. Fox and Mr. Rylance allowed their egos back in 2001 to propel them into this thing masquerading as art. I can not imagine why. The director and all the participants have held fast to the notion that all the sex was simulated with the sole exception of Ms. Fox's now well known close up taking his erect penis down her throat. Why they should have done this act for real and simulated all the others leaves me wondering.

Of course we are treated to the usual bare breasts (mostly hers) and bare rears (both, but male buttocks seem to be mandatory now). And we get several views of the middle aged Mr. Rylance with his bobbing erection. How any of this actually contributes to the story escapes me. I'm no prude, but there is ultimately the question of taste. Directors have an obligation to ask the question, ""Is this in good taste; do I absolutely need  to put my actors through this to tell my story."" In this case I think we could have gotten the message with the nudity, back sides, thrusting, grunting and open mouth gasping for orgasmic air already provided.

I must also ask why it fell to the woman to do the job, and not to Rylance. We have a terrible double standard in this regard. Rylance went right on with his career. Many see him as ""the man."" Ms. Fox suffered a 2 year downturn and while continuing to work has never become the major mainstream actor she might have been. But, of course, she is the woman who ""did him.""

And this was not without additional consequences. Ms. Fox's life partner and mother to his children, a noted journalist, has confessed on more than one occasion that this has all been at times a heavy cross for him to bear. To his credit, he said that if she wanted to do it he would go along and support her even with what it was doing to him. He even had to show up at screenings with her and watch his wife engaging in multiple acts in great detail on the big screen. And he has to do it sitting next to the man who's crotch she had consumed for history.

Of course, everyone agreed afterward that the director and his actors were all very professional, and considerate and just dived in to get the job done. That it was all very choreographed and that they stretched themselves (and their various parts I suppose) to see how far they could go. Then this was all validated with some awards to make everyone feel as though they had achieved something worthwhile.

Sex is not acting. Billions of people have been doing it for millions of years. What we have here is either a mediocre art film or bad porno. Take your pick. And there is NOTHING intimate about it. It is a voyeurs delight calculated to sell tickets and DVD's and in that it succeeds. At the end, Holden and I were waiting for Peggy Lee to break into a chorus of ""Is that all there is?"" But she never showed. The phoney.",1427155200,3,3396,4.30359937402191
