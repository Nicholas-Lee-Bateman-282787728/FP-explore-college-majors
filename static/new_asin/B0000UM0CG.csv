8003089,5,B0000UM0CG,"What really made this production special, was the fact
that LYN PAUL was in it. She effectively played a very
down-trodden woman, and sang the haunting
""Talk amongst yourselves"", which should have been
a huge hit record. Transforming into an ""Independent Woman"",
which was also a standout song sung by Lyn, in the production.
Taboo, was true to the Boy George and friends story, and it
was great to see it out on DVD, happy memories of The Venue
Theatre in London`s West End.",1506643200,,475,4.666666666666667

8003093,5,B0000UM0CG,"I saw this show nearly 30 times in the uk and even went to broadway in the end for a few perfomances - it is , for me , the best musical i have ever seen - the songs , the acting , the script - it can make you laugh so much and then cry so much as well but overall you leave the theatre amazed and needing to see it again - so buy the dvd and then you can - hopefully george will re lauch the musical in the uk when he gets a chance - wow !!!",1337126400,,442,3.386138613861386
8003094,4,B0000UM0CG,"i bought this for one particular actor, whose performance was, for me, the highlight of the show. it's a very odd movie, very popular for some audiences, the exact opposite for others, but highly evocative of a time and lifestyle that's pretty much changed now. the film is a combination of highs and lows, some of the dialog good, some terrible; some of the costuming excellent, some, well, not so excellent, in fact, strange; some of the acting good, some wooden; most of the plot murky. still, it does have an appeal.",1311120000,,520,4.663043478260869
