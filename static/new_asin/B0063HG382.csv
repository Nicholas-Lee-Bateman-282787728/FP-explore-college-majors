4938024,5,B0063HG382,"This is a fantastic and beautiful movie about love, loss, and survival during wartime. Tom Wlaschiha is absolutely phenomenal in this movie and really brings the emotion to the role. I thought the premise was really interesting but instead of focusing on a resistance movement like the title would suggest with tons of action, we see how the people left behind deal with living life without their loved ones and we see how tenuous alliances form between soldier and civilian. This movie does what other movies does not, it portrays people on all sides in a humane and multi-dimensional way.",1435276800,,590,4.91
4938025,5,B0063HG382,"YES, this is fiction. YES, you'll have to suspend all disbelief.
I bought this (the Blu-Ray is region free and plays on my US player just fine) because a couple favorites from Game of Thrones are in it, and O M G. I've been gut-punched in the feels by Tom Wlaschiha. His performance is beautiful and absolutely flawless, and had me crying my eyes out at the end, and I'm not a crier. Somebody please give this man more movies.",1433376000,4,426,4.3375
4938026,5,B0063HG382,"I bought this movie after reading the novel by Owen Sheers. Netfix didn't have it, and I love Michael Sheen, so I figured I would give it a try. I was very glad I did. Although I feel it was a bit over-edited, it is a quiet, beautiful movie that relies on the strength of the actors' abilities to express a deep range of emotion with limited dialogue.  This is a movie that trusts the viewer to get it on their own without a lot of narration or exposition. I also found the premise intruiging - what would have happened if Britain had been occupied by the Germans. It explores the relationships of people who are forced into proximity with one another and come to realize that it's not so easy to hate a person as it is a faceless enemy.  Sheen's screen time is brief and this movie really belongs to Wlaschiha, who I believe we can expect great things from in the future.",1368316800,5,872,4.278787878787878
4938027,3,B0063HG382,"I know, I bought one from AmazomUK. Interesting low budget film, which I enjoyed very much. My only complaint was that there are no subtitles for the English portion of the dialog. Shop around for the best price. The book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resistance/dp/0307385833/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resistance</a>&nbsp;is worth a read also.",1354060800,3,390,7.319148936170213
4938028,4,B0063HG382,"A lot of people gave flack about this movie being unrealistic or unfaithful to the truth. I felt like given the parameters set for this film, it was a great story. So if you have a bit of imagination and are able immerse yourself in the world the author and directors intended, I don't think you will be disappointed. They very clearly state that the story is set as though the Germans successfully invaded the UK after D-Day. Take that into consideration and enjoy the storytelling.",1338422400,6,483,4.627906976744186
4938039,5,B0063HG382,"I'm not sure why this flick got so many bad reviews. I could understand if the movie is only rated with one criteria, like script, story or acting, but if I take into account all of these collectively, including direction, I think this deserves more than one or two stars. I gave it five because I was impressed with acting, The pace is slow, but it allowed the story to breathe and feelings to be interpreted.
I highly recommend it to all Indy film buffs.",1493683200,,456,4.376470588235295

4938041,3,B0063HG382,"The film is beautifully shot.  Very slow moving.  I was very frustrated by the lack of translation for the German dialogue, of which there was quite a lot.  It left large chunks of the story unexplained.",1492905600,,203,4.583333333333333

4938044,5,B0063HG382,"Superb. The acting, minimalist editing, story, filming--all superb. Art film. Requires intelligence and familiarity with very good film-making to appreciate. Concerned with the human experience during occupation. Relish the beauty of both depiction and depth. If you need ""action"" and Hollywood narrative, don't bother.",1492473600,4,319,6.2727272727272725
4938045,1,B0063HG382,"I love WW II movies, but this was one of the most boring movies I have seen! Weak script, weak dialogue, in fact the only reason I am writing this review is to warn you not to waste your money on it!!!!",1491868800,,202,3.8333333333333335

4938071,1,B0063HG382,Absolutely Horrible! I love WW2 and history movies. This is awful.  Spoiler ahead:  The young man (i.e. hero shooter) only succeeds in killing an animal which devastates an old lady  who is placed in an awful situation to begin with.  He could have some guts and shoot the enemy.  The ending is open-ended and just completely unsatisfying.  Please do not waste your money on this.,1490486400,7,380,4.769230769230769
4938072,2,B0063HG382,"Slow moving and hard to believe.  D-Day was a failure, and thus, England was doomed?  What, they lost their army, fleet, American allies, and the splash from all the ships going down also drowned the Red Army?  You're going to produce alternative history, at least make it plausible.  This was not, and the plodding pace made it worse.  Not worth the price.",1490486400,6,357,4.693548387096774
4938073,1,B0063HG382,"I am totally into this era and I thought this movie would be an interesting scenario of the Germans winning WW II.  I love the two actors from the Game of thrones as well.  Unfortunately, the movie, in my opinion, was so disappointing.  One of the two actors had very little exposure in the movie. And talk about slooooooow. I cant believe I sat through the whole thing.  I would give it  star if I could.",1489968000,3,405,4.276315789473684

4938078,3,B0063HG382,"I enjoyed the movie very much except for the horrible direction. I hope Mr. Gupta will not direct any more. His pregnant pauses in the movie really seemed like a full nine months. But I had read the book so could follow the plot though more should have been invested in the symbiosis between the German soldiers and Welsh women (take time from the long, long pauses).  We did a showing for our Welsh society and no one who had not read the book could follow it.  My wife, a member of the Screen Actors' Guild (and a big fan of Owen Sheers) could not stand it. I guess you chalk part of it up to the low budget.",1460851200,,610,4.117647058823529

8492046,3,B0063HG382,I picked the book up because it was on a clearance sale and I couldn't put it down once I started reading. The movie follows the book but I gave it three stars because I hated the way it ended.,1495756800,,193,3.85
