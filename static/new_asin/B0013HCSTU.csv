8250988,5,B0013HCSTU,"I have looked for this title since 1995 under ""Alone, Unarmed, and Unafraid"".  This was the mission my unit (152 TRG) flew in Desert Shield/Storm.  This movie had been lent to me by a senior supervisor while I was in the ANG.  I wanted to show this to my children so they could understand what my mission in the AF was.  Now they do.  The extra footage was also great to watch even without narration.  I miss this old bird and was sad when it was removed from the U.S. arsenal in favor of drones, but understand.
