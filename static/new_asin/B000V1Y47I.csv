2928498,5,B000V1Y47I,I enjoyed this film very much. The young girl has such a natural talent that she makes the movie! I recommend watching this movie.,1220400000,,130,4.458333333333333
2928499,3,B000V1Y47I,"Nina Kervel-Bey, the young star of this movie, is a gifted actress who gives a marvelous performance.  She brings this movie to partial life, portraying the main character with a natural presence. The story is told through her eyes, and I could not help but feel sympathy for her. Her childhood is turned upside down by her parents infatuation with leftist politics, and she feels abandoned. Her parents have little time for her now that they have joined the revolution. We see the effects of that neglect, and we see her anger.

The nuns who run Anna's school never have a chance, portrayed as distant figures who tolerate no discussion about their authority, and waste no time in verbally reprimanding Anna for her youthful questions. Her catholic classmates eventually turn on her with cruelty because of her forced absence from bible study.  Her best friend spends the night at Anna's apartment, and gets a view of her father's naked body. This upsets the child, but only because she is a young reactionary.

The communist friends of her parents initially tease Anna for her counter-revolutionary beliefs, but eventually the movie shows them to be kindly and understanding friends. Anna learns to doubt everything, (even her parent's politics, to the filmmakers`s credit) and leaves catholic school of her own accord.

Reading the other reviews of this film, I was struck by how easily the Amazon reviewers slip into the Marxist vernacular. Words like bourgeoise, communist solidarity and fascistic conformity slip off the pen. The true believers still exist.

Although no one is demonized in the film, the filmmaker's leftist sympathies are never in doubt.  Other reviewers have noted that the viewer is never hit over the head with ""ham fisted polemics.""  This film is a very polished piece of propaganda. Fidel must be very proud. My own experience was a catharsis of all emotion, which befits the tragedy.",1219795200,8,1913,5.031645569620253
2928500,5,B000V1Y47I,"Little Anna is stuck in the middle between conservative bourgeoise grandparents, Catholic school friends and teachers, and her increasingly radicalized parents in 1970's Paris, and she doesn't like it one little bit.

Centered on an astonishing portrayal by young Nina Kervel-Bey, her defiant Anna with her pugnacious chin jutting-out fearlessly faces the various forces swirling around her with justifiable frustration and anger at the upset and turmoil created in her young life by neglectful parents caught up in their leftist political passions and the likewise estrangement from the conervative foundations of her previously privileged life. Her spirit is undiminished however as she faces them all down with wit and preternatural common sense, asking the difficult question and demanding attention and respect.  This little girl is wonderfully expressive and impressive and Gravas has elicited a marvelous performance from her.

While I assume Gravas sympathies probably lie with the politics of the parents, she is very even-handed in her depiction of all sides and is never polemical but instead finds the humanity in all.  Being the daughter of a famously political director herself, she must have brought great understanding to the confusion and anger of a young child who could care less about politics but experiences only absent and distracted parents and a comfortable life overthrown for passions and principles she does not understand and is very perceptive in pricking the pretensions of while revealing the confusion in the adults around her.

A very fine film, well acted by all, but little Nina is the whole show and for one so small and lovely to dominate and carry a film of this depth with such ferocious confidence and humor is a tribute to the wee actor and her director and is well worth anyone's time.",1219449600,8,1828,5.225255972696246
2928501,5,B000V1Y47I,"Set in Paris in 1970-71, this is a film about 9-year-old Anna, growing up in the home of leftist political activists. Directed by Julie Gavras, daughter herself of political filmmaker Costa-Gavras, the film represents the attempts of a child to make sense of the earnest turmoil that has upset her previously untroubled middle-class life, as well as concepts like solidarity. Her father, played by Italian actor Stefano Accorsi, has fled Franco's Spain and along with his wife (Julie Depardieu, daughter of Gerard Depardieu) becomes involved in the election of Chile's socialist president Allende. Chilean exiles begin filling their home, while Anna's mother embarks on a project to make abortion more freely available to French women.

Meanwhile, Anna and her young brother, are exposed to the anti-communist sentiments of a Cuban nanny and her wealthy grandparents. A conservative friend from Catholic school provides a further complication. Torn in a variety of directions, the young heroine soldiers on, with an independent spirit of her own, confronting both the certainties and uncertainties of her parents. Told from her point of view, the camera is often at a child's eye level, and amid all the unresolved confusion there are also moments of comedy, provided often by her diminutive little brother. The DVD includes a making-of featurette, deleted scenes, and other features, with an emphasis on the challenge of directing children.",1218931200,2,1441,5.376106194690266
2928502,5,B000V1Y47I,"I thought that the parents' ideology and the actual political sublot was less interesting than Anna's struggle to understand the discrepancies and immaturity of her parents. She clearly takes control when she innocently asks her Dad to explain the difference between solidarity and sheep behavior for which the father has no response. Another amazing show of her ability to set limitations to her father is when she runs out of her house with her brother to the library. When she decides to come back her father sees her in the eyes with fury, and she stands tall and shows her mother how to place limits on him. That was truly amazing.

Truthfully, the leftist and rightist characters and their respective cliches, as well as the bonus pro-choice advert, were in no way as relevant (or even as fairly portrayed) as how it was the reaction and analysis of a child and adults. The parents are living in an unrealistic dream believing that they are actually helping the Allende regime from Paris. The open their apartment to hairy smoking drinking and late night comunist ideologits and students that all they do is plan and converse on utopic comunism. Anna doesn't understand where her parents are going, but she reminds them that she and her brother are more important to them.

In the end, when she actually changes schools and joins in the circle with the other kids, it is Anna becoming a child again understanding her parents' limitations, forgiving, adapting and caring. What a great movie you should all see it!!!",1202342400,3,1520,4.842307692307692
2928503,5,B000V1Y47I,"This debut film by Julie Gavras, daughter of famed Greek-born director Costa-Gavras (e.g., Z, 1969), was nominated for the Grand Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007.  In addition to directing, Julie Gavras also collaborated with Arnaud Cathrine on the script which they adapted from a novel by Italian novelist Domitilla Calamai.  What is striking about the story is the way it reconstructs how girls become social, how they learn about their world, how they question it, and how they reconcile the contradictions, and how they grow up.

Doing the growing up is nine-year-old Anna de la Mesa, played with fidelity, wit, and skill beyond her years by Nina Kervel-Bey.  She is bourgeois to the core, following the lead of her maternal grandparents, who own a vineyard in Bordeaux, and her favorite nanny and housekeeper who lost everything to the Communists when Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba.  Her parents, however, are infatuated with the Left, especially with the rise of Allende to power in Chile.  The year is 1970-71.

Anna loves their house and garden and going to Catholic school.  She is proper and sensible.  When they lose their house, and have to let the nanny go, and end up renting an apartment in Paris, Anna is upset and demands to know why things have changed.  When it appears that they don't have as much money, Anna begins turning off the lights and turning down the heat to save money.  When they want her to transfer to the public school, she demurs and a compromise is made: she can continue to go to Catholic school but she is not allowed to take Bible studies.  So when that time of the day comes, she has to stand up and go outside the classroom door and wait.

But Anna is strong emotionally and intellectually.  She questions everything and is not self-conscious about being singled out.  The other girls may laugh, but when she gets into a fight with one of them, she manages to win her over afterwards so that they are friends, even though their parents are not.

There is in the background the political disputes between the Right and the Left, between parents who change the subject when the question how babies are made is brought up, and those who tell the truth, in short between the bourgeois and the bohemian.  One gets the sense that Gavras and Anna are wiser than the disputants, and that there is something to appreciate in both ways of life.

It is impossible not to identify with little Anna, partially because she herself is so fair, and partially because it is such a thrill to see the psychology of the socialization process displayed so well and true in a movie, but also because Nina Kervel-Bey is such a powerful little actress who was so wondrously directed by Julie Gavras.  This is one of the best performances by a preteen actor that I have ever seen.  Kervel-Bey simply dominates the film and commands the screen.

Will Anna shed her petite bourgeois ways and embrace the politics of her parents?  I highly recommend that you see this film and find out.",1198022400,3,3022,4.67296786389414
2928504,5,B000V1Y47I,"""Blame it on Fidel"" is the best kind of political film. Hardly ""objective"" it nevertheless completely avoids hitting the viewer over the head with hamfisted polemics. The ""leftist"" characters are all portrayed in a way that is sympathetic but never two-dimensional - while the ""rightist"" characters are all portrayed in a way that respects their humanity - while revealing the problems with their politics. Of course this is true most of all of the main character, little Anna - who charmingly prefers her previously privileged ""good life"" to the sacrifices that result from her parents embrace of radical political causes. Most amazingly of all, we watch as Director Gavras almost miraculously and seamlessly allows Anna to slowly (and completely convincingly) do a little radicalizing herself.

Both Anna and her little brother, Francois, are the cutest little red diaper babies to ever hit the big screen. Francois, by the way, takes up the red banner far more quickly and enthusiastically than his big sister. One of the key scenes is when Anna has invited a school friend over - the friend is horrified by the smallness of their apartment, the wierdness of their food, the strange people having endless meetings in the living room, etc. Little Francois has an answer for everything though (for example - he prefers sleeping in the same room with his sister to sleeping alone in his own room). Anna can't help but smile proudly at Francois as he defends their family against the bourgeois philistinism of Anna's school friend.

The film even manages to have very thoughtful subplots on abortion and comparative religion! Seriously - this is a true work of genius. Every single character is brilliantly acted, the writing is wonderful - the music is great, the cinematography is beautiful.",1196553600,14,1792,5.071186440677966
2928505,5,B000V1Y47I,"Young Anna (played by the remarkable Nina Kervel-Bey) has difficulty adapting to the changes in lifestyle forced upon her when her parents give up the comforts of a bourgeois life in order to struggle for women's rights in France and the Chilean revolution of Allende.  She demands explanations that the adults around her think she is too young to receive, and which she is then required to supply for herself by piecing together the elements of her experience.  This is a very fine film, that traces in both subtle and humorous ways the connections between familial ties and political convictions, and the impact of a parent's activism on the lives of children.

It is also, unlike many films that explore similar territory, at bottom a comedy -- both in the broad sense that the upheavals the film traces are thrown upon its characters by circumstance and result ultimately in things working themselves out, and in the more specific sense that it is filled with humorous moments rooted in the misconceptions of a precocious child about the nature of the convictions that dominate her parents lives.  The humor and ultimate resolution of the film, however, does not arrive without passing through the awareness of many tragic moments and serious issues.  Still, all of this is seen from the point of view of a child -- and the film's greatest strength lies in its rigorous adoption of the viewpoint of the child.  The camera work in particular is both remarkable and subtle, and gives the impression of a child's take on the world without resorting to the awkwardness of strict point of view shots -- what it lingers on, how it frames its attention, all suggest the very specific interests of the very precocious Anna.  This approach of sharing the child's questioning perspective on events allows the filmmakers to explore, without being didactic, many of the contradictions and confusions of politics and activism, and in particular of the activism that followed in France on the student riots of 1968: the conflict and overlap of communist solidarity and fascistic conformity, the tension between political struggles for liberation and women's struggles for reproductive freedom, the right to property and the pursuit of prosperity in opposition to the demand for equal access to resources, and religious versus political convicion.

While the film is unrated, there is very little in the way of actual violence or other objectionable material on screen -- though there is talk regarding sensitive subjects like abortion and political violence.  The film would be very appropriate for young people who finds themselves asking some of the same kinds of questions about the contradictions of politics and life as Anna asks in the film.",1194825600,34,2737,5.0509977827051
2928506,5,B000V1Y47I,"BLAME IT ON FIDEL! ('La Faute  Fidel!) is an enlightening film from France's fine director Julie Gavras, a story based on the novel 'Tutta colpa di Fidel' by Domitilla Calamai that addresses the effect of major political, philosophical, and activist effects on children. What makes this fine film unique is the child's stance on the adult politics: what may seem like exciting challenges for change of an existing corrupt system for the adults may indeed be an unwanted rearrangement of the wants and needs of children whose political acumen is less advanced than the need for order and consistency in everyday life.

The story takes place in Paris in 1970 - 1971.  9-year-old Anna de la Mesa (Nina Kervel-Bey) is a bright child who loves the divinity aspects of her Catholic school and enjoys the wealthy bourgeois elegance that surrounds her.  She and her little brother Franois (Benjamin Feuillet) are informed that their aunt, an anti-Franco activist from Spain, will be moving in with Anna and her parents Fernando (Stefano Accorsi) and Marie (Julie Depardieu). This critical move incites a change in philosophy for Anna's parents and soon they become enchanted with the rise of Allende in Chile and embrace the Socialist mindset and the promised feminist movement changes, moving from their elegant house into a small apartment and demanding that Anna give up her divinity studies 'because the are against Communist thought'.  As liaison in France for Chilean activists, Fernando holds strange and frequent meetings, disturbing further the life Anna loves. While little Franois is able to go along with the life changes, Anna rebels and refuses to alter her goals and needs merely for the 'fad' of her father's frequent trips to Chile while leaving behind her mother to continue writing articles for the ('bourgeois') French magazine Marie-Claire! As the political upheavals increase Anna is more pugnacious in demanding her rights and the finest moments of the story demonstrate how a child can respond to political change and still find her 'place' in the world that she chooses!

The pacing of the film is fast and captures the exhilaration of the foment 'round the world in the early 1970s.  The cast is excellent, especially the children who have not had prior exposure to acting.  The message is a potent one that deserves our attention both as informative of a political era and as a piece of veritas cinema from a fine director and crew.  In French and Spanish with English subtitles.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, November 07",1194393600,13,2544,5.047732696897374

8216223,4,B000V1Y47I,"As an individual who experienced both Franco's Spain and Allende's Chile, I found this film to be a trip down Revolution Road.
To read more into it than a comedic and affectionate portrayal of a generational backlash against fascism and all sorts of oppression is silly. It is charming and entertaining to say the least! Nobody changed the world but the world has changed thanks to those that dreamt of equality, justice and a new day.",1308182400,,435,4.7368421052631575
8216224,5,B000V1Y47I,"Great Movie! I've seen it at least 4 times. I personally can relate to this movie as my child hood has haunting similarities, but I wounder if some may not be able to relate as their experience growing up may have been very different. This movie is in French which I understand a little and I have been there so that adds to the enjoyment for me. If you do not like reading caption you will not make it through this movie. It is politically motivated and has heavy Marxist overtones, which I am not, but it was the world I grew up in. The young actress is great in this film. 5 stars",1276646400,,583,4.12280701754386
8216225,2,B000V1Y47I,"[...]. The Marxist radicals are portrayed sympathetically while the nuns at the girls private school are portrayed as cold and rigidly authoritarian, the usual stereotype of the Church representer of moral absolutes. Intended or not, the willingness of Annas mother to lie (about having had an abortion)to further her moral relativistic agenda highlights a fundamental flaw of collectivism/Marxism/progressivism/communitarianism, etc. And we are currently seeing that same willingness on the part of collectivist ""watermelons"" in advancing the AGW scam. The ends do not jusify the means. The ending scene of the movie is very telling: Anna goes to a new school, leaving the structured Catholic school she has attended. She enters the new school and all is chaos, kids shouting running and playing. Anna stands in confusion for a few moments, then joins the collective, playing with them. What are they learning? What is the point of the chaos and lack of structure? The true lesson of statist schooling: the lesson is to JOIN, to assimilate, to become part of the borg or be outcast. Anna is a human sacrifice to the state god, becoming herd animal rather than fully human.",1262390400,4,1173,5.178947368421053
8216226,5,B000V1Y47I,"I think the movie is all about the child protagonist. How she is forcefully weaned away from one ideology to another purely on the whims of her parents. young Nina is from a well to do family and her whole life of living in mansions and studying in catholic school is turned upside down because of her parents ideological shift. She protests at every stage and constantly keeps asking her parents what if they are wrong?
  But ultimately she seems to give in but as the last scene suggests, she becomes accommodating and open in her views and is now ready for the whole wide colored and multidimensional world without any prejudices. It is a beautiful evolution of the child.",1261612800,,675,4.616666666666666
8216227,5,B000V1Y47I,"This film shows just how smart and curious real children are as they try to make sense of a very complex world. Writing, performances, production values and directing all deserve kudos - mostly, it's a film that ought to be shown in schools it's so kid-aware and friendly!",1237680000,,272,4.6875
8216228,4,B000V1Y47I,"Set in the politically turbulent Paris of the 1970s, ""Blame it on Fidel"" tells of a sheltered young girl who has her comfortable bourgeois existence ripped away from her after her staid, conformist parents (Julie Depardieu, Stefano Accorsi) suddenly become born again leftist radicals.  Anna is forced to give up the home she loves and the nanny she adores when her father quits his job in order to dedicate himself full time to fighting for the proletariat against the repressive corporate powers of the world.  The family moves from their spacious home in the country to a cramped apartment in the city, which is often filled with bearded revolutionaries who utter strange catch-phrases in barely audible whispers.

Thanks to a thoughtful script and sensitive direction, ""Blame it on Fidel"" manages to provide a compelling child's-eye view of the adult world.  Incapable of grasping the ""big picture"" as her parents see it, Anna knows only that the family is now woefully short on cash (she runs around the house flipping off light switches and heaters to save electricity), and that her mother and father are so preoccupied with their ""cause"" that Anna and her little brother (the adorable, scene-stealing Benjamin Feuillet) seem to have been relegated to mere afterthoughts in their parents' tremendously busy lives.  In a performance rich in insight and wisdom and utterly un-self-conscious in tone, nine-year-old Nina Kervel-Bey brings to life a character who often doesn`t fully understand what`s going on in the world around her but who never gives up trying to figure it all out.  For a good part of the time, Anna is torn between childish curiosity and an indefinable sense of shame regarding her parents' newfound activities.  Yet, through keen observation and endless questioning, and the eventual piecing together of the many unfiltered fragments that come floating her way,  Anne is finally able to come to some kind of understanding, however imperfect, of the much larger world community of which she is only a very small but crucial part.

Despite the inherently ideological nature of the material, writer/director Julie Gavras, the daughter of famed filmmaker Costa-Gavras, keeps most of the political stuff in the background while she concentrates on the strain the grownups feel as they strive to juggle their save-the-world activities with their duties as parents.

Add to this some excellent performances by a talented cast and a rich, flavorful score by Armand Amar and ""Blame it on Fidel"" becomes a film well worth checking out.  In this her second venture as a director, Ms. Gavras has done her old man proud.",1227830400,,2633,5.1142191142191145
