8186544,3,1572524316,"This story was pretty good, but the acting was TERRIBLE!!! Except, of course for Micheal Gambon, who, as always, was excellent. Seriously, the rest of the cast was absolutely laughable. It kind of felt like watching ""actors"" in a jr high school play. If you told me that the casting directors actually went out looking for the worst actors they could find, I'd have no choice but to believe you...Dont get me wrong, overall, I did enjoy this, but the ONLY reason i did, was because of Mr. Gambon's performance. Anyway, to wrap up - good story, although it did seem to drag slowly at times, and a steller performance from Gambon. If you're a fan of his, this is worth seeing. Im glad I did. But if you're not a fan of his, or if you're not ok with only one character being watchable, then you might prefer to pass this one up, cause the rest of the performances could just ruin it for you.",1345680000,,888,4.355421686746988

I was really captivated by the flashbacks, and by the dining table servings.  I have watched it several times and will still continue to watch it.  Thank you very much for an excellent movie.",1014076800,11,365,5.033333333333333
