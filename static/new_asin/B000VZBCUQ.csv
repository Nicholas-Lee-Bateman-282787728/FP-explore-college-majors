8220563,5,B000VZBCUQ,"Refuge of Last Resort offered yet another look into the personal lives of the survivors of the most costliest natural disasters on record. This docu-drama showed personal struggles to carry on and endure what not only the local, state, but the federal government stood by and let become chaos and anarchy. Through the one-on-one's in this dvd, basic and natural instincts kick in order make it through and protect home and hearth, as the old saying goes. The things I could not understand at all was WHY split up families to be shipped to parts unknown and WHY not allow those who wanted to, to come back to rebuild their homes? In this and others, those were questions that never really go any straight up answers. I really did feel for all those people affected by this tragic situation. I wanted to help them than and I still want to help them today.",1369180800,4,853,4.5816993464052285
8220564,3,B000VZBCUQ,"I live in New Orleans.  But I was one of the lucky ones to evaluate before Hurricane Katrina. I know first hand about the destruction of the Lower Ninth Ward. I would have thought the movie would have gaven more information about the Lower Ninth Ward, Lakeview, Central City to name a few places. I also thought it would have gaven more information about the aftermath. This maybe the true story of Hurricane Katrina from director point of view but, it is not the whole story or part of the whole story.",1368835200,,503,4.467391304347826
8220565,5,B000VZBCUQ,"I was a rescuer during Katrina and Rita and I ordered several documentaries here several years later to get a look from the outside in.  This movie was the BEST raw look from someone that stayed and weathered the storm, including all of the chaos afterwards.  You will see a lot of things the main stream media overlooked and/or just didn't show during all this.  Through the view of someone surviving within the city limits, you view the frustrations and let downs of all the rescue efforts.  As a rescuer, I will say we did what we could with what we had, but I admit there were alot of people left out to dry by the whole process.  It's the first film I saw that really depicted the atmosphere of fear and what people really endured for their own survival.  Highly recommended.",1363219200,3,780,4.457746478873239
8220566,4,B000VZBCUQ,"Despite the fact that this is an hour long video filmed by an amateur, I found it to be quite interesting and well produced.  The corporate-owned networks never reveal the total spectrum of any major event.  Most people should realize by now that anything that doesn't match the official story format crafted by the damage-control specialists won't make it to primetime tv.  This film fills in some of the blanks.  Unfortunately it doesn't contain any footage of the door to door firearm confiscation that was implemented in the upper middle class neighborhoods.",1327276800,3,562,5.076086956521739
8220567,4,B000VZBCUQ,"Hurricane Katrina: Refuge of Last Resort is a very personal look at the chaos that ensued in New Orleans in the aftermath of the 2005 mega-storm.  It would certainly seem to accurately reflect the colossal failure of local, state, and federal governments to respond to the crisis in anything approaching an acceptable manner, offering many a poignant moment along the way.  It also shows how some New Orleans residents failed to take the hurricane seriously, as we see that Bourbon Street was not exactly closed for business even as the rain and wind of the storm arrived in the city.  James L. Bills was one of many people who did not evacuate the city (he says the mayor's warning came too late, as if you need a public official to tell you the mother of all storms is heading right for you).  Instead, he holed up with his family in one of the larger hotels in town.  What we see in this personal documentary is the state of affairs in New Orleans over the next few days, as he wandered around the city with video camera in hand.  This is all private footage that has not been seen elsewhere.

I was surprised at how little footage there was of the sights and sounds of the hurricane itself, but Bills' camera shows us scene after scene of devastation in the hours and days afterward.  We can see a noticeable police presence in the immediate aftermath that disappears long before the National Guard finally rolls in on Day 4.  By far the most powerful images, though, are those of hundreds if not thousands of people waiting in disorganized lines for hours and hours outside the trash-riddled Superdome and elsewhere - waiting for long-delayed buses that would take them who knows where for who knows how long.  Even as the rescue mission starts up in earnest, saving victims from rooftops and attics, untold numbers of people wait in dire conditions in and around the very airport serving as the staging ground for those rescue efforts.  Just in case anyone doubts the inefficiency and unprepared nature of government relief efforts, Bills films truckloads of portable toilets being delivered in and around the convention center - several hours after the place had finally been evacuated.

The images speak for themselves, but the video also includes a number of ordinary citizens recounting the ordeals they went through just to find food and water in the increasingly lawless days preceding the arrival of outside help, the suffering they endured standing in line for hours with little or no information after that help arrived, and the sights of human suffering and misery they witnessed, particularly among the young and elderly, in the unbearably hot and humid conditions.

As poignant a story as this video tells, though, one must keep in mind that it is not an objective look at the whole situation.  I'm not discounting the great toll of personal tragedy that ensued in New Orleans following Katrina, but I must say that a number of the comments from Bills as well as those interviewed are not necessarily true.  We hear a lot of the rumors and hearsay that fueled the media's shamefully sensationalistic coverage of the tragedy.  There is no denying, though, that Bills' film offers viewers a small taste of the misery the poor people of New Orleans needlessly suffered at the hands of FEMA and other ineptly run government agencies who clearly failed them and all of America.",1221436800,3,3390,4.789022298456261
8220568,4,B000VZBCUQ,"I'm going to make this very brief.  Everyone should see this film. It may open their eyes to what's going on in this country.  This film shows what the MAIN STREAM MEDIA doesn't want you to see. The nightmare that so many lived through was heartbreaking.  How can we be on the other side of the world in 2 days to help tidal wave victims, but can't do anything in our own country, for our own people until 5 days after the levees broke!  UNACCEPTABLE!!!  Many people stranded were sick, elderly, and poor who just did not have the means to get out or any place to go if they were to get out.  Read my words, they didn't have a choice!",1188432000,8,634,4.155737704918033
8220569,1,B000VZBCUQ,"I am a native of South Louisiana & I was really disappointed in the movie.  It only showed one small, small corner of New Orleans during this time. I do not agree with the way thing were portrayed in this film at all. Everyone had a choice, maybe not the money to evacuate but everyone knew what may be coming & what could happen. After the storm, there was mass hysteria. How could they just let everyone loose & not try to restore order. There was curfews in place, there had to be. If there was not police officers & National Guard trying to control the situation can you imagine how much worse things could have been? I was scared to death when they started bussing all of these people into my hometown. They were devastated, hysterical & had nothing. A great bit of these people believed that we owed them something & would loot homes, we heard of robberies. What were they supposed to do other than contain these people until they could get them back under control? I probably would have been just as hysterical if not worse, but I understand that when you have a situation like that there has got to be order. But I also have to say that no matter how many times it was a false alarm, or how much money it will cost, I still evacuate. I have been through Hurricane Andrew, then we had Bob Breck telling us for Lily & Rita that if you were where I lived & stayed you were going to die. It is a very bad feeling, you freak out. I refuse to stay for another storm, I do not care if the Governor orders a mandatory evacuation or not - I have a choice & a brain, I can make that call on my own, if I stay for a storm & this happens again then shame on me not blame everyone else. Nobody owes me anything, I have to take care of myself & not depend on others to tell me what to do.",1181260800,5,1782,4.091428571428572
8220570,4,B000VZBCUQ,"Stranded in a New Orleans hotel with a group of five adults and four children, film maker James Bills put his camera to good use in his native city. In this one-hour documentary, with no stock footage at all, he records the city before, during, and mainly after Hurricane Katrina hit on August 29, 2005. Even today, seeing his film, it is hard to comprehend the terrifying power, destructive force, and catastrophic flooding of the storm. Bills interviews a handful of citizens and with understated narration lets them tell their stories. The bald lies and gross incompetence of local, state, and especially the federal government loom large. ""It has changed me forever,"" reminisced one woman. ""I will never depend upon the government for anything. You're on your own."" A recent article in the New York Times suggested that 18 months later, New Orleans's population has probably topped out at less than half of its pre-hurricane size.",1169769600,11,934,4.993589743589744
