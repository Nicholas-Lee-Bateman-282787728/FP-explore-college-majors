7943497,4,B00005KI47,"This is one of the very few commercial videotapes on the planet that provides instruction in the 20's charleston, so if you want to learn how to dance to Chicago or New Orleans jazz, here's your chance.
However, the second half of the tape abandons the 20s charleston and jumps forward ten years in history to the 1930s to teach the charleston steps that are a part of the lindy hop, an entirely different dance done to swing jazz.
Marcus and barbl, the two instructors are top notch dancers and do an admirable job of trying to communicate a large number of fairly complicated and subtle steps on this tape. In fact, I'm glad that I had a couple of years of dance under my belt when I bought the tape, because were I a total beginner, I'm sure that I wouldn't have been able to mimic the moves presented on the tape.

I see this tape as being primarily targeted to people who already have some experience with the lindy hop and want to expand their repetoire of lindy charleston steps and get a foundation in the 20s charleston.
The production isn't the best and the picture is sometimes not as crisp as I would have liked, but the instructors are enthusiastic and playful and select good jazz music for the tape.",1059004800,6,1214,4.443946188340807
7943498,5,B00005KI47,"This video was great for learning steps and turns that can be used in charleston. The Instructors Marcus & Brbl were thorough and easy to follow. The dance steps are broken down for both, the guy and girl. We know Marcus & Brbl for a long time and we promise they have a lot of experience in teaching and competing.",997833600,2,315,4.266666666666667
