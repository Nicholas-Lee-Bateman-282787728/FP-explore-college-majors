1253771,4,B00002E24F,"As an H.L. Hunley / submarine buff, I thoroughly enjoyed this TNT orignal motion picture. I thought Armand Assante was a credible (if somewhat long in the tooth) Lt. Geo. Dixon. (The real Dixon was in his late 20s) Assante has an odd puckering facial expression that is a bit distracting and his southern accent is only fair. As always, Donald Sutherland was a joy to watch in his portrayal of the interesting and moody General P.T. Beauregard. The ending was a bit maudlin, due to the nature of what really happened, but it wasn't a big distraction for me.
The ""official"" review by Amazon is off base in saying that the sub was named after the captain of a previous vessel. In actuality, Horace Lawson Hunley was a wealthy cotton broker who helped finance the building of the Hunley. He drowned when he made a fatal error in operating the Hunley as did the other seven men on board the boat.
I have watched this film at least five times and will again soon. The soundtrack album is excellent as well!",974246400,7,1001,4.5054945054945055
1253772,5,B00002E24F,"The Hunley really did a good job in bringing that part of submarine history alive for me. The movie may be a bit crude, but that made it seem all the more realistic: the trouble finding a good crew, with every sailor knowing the boat's history; the perserverance of Lieutenant Dixon, who knew the Hunley had some redeeming value; the fears and danger that came with living in Charleston; the difficluties and problems with being stuck in a tiny iron prison that would make anyone claustrophobic with guys who really wished You weren't there; then, bonding with them, working with them, even dying with them.  The humor lines are good, the acting well done, and the story line is the best part because it was basically true. It's an excellent movie if I've ever seen one.",973814400,6,770,4.661764705882353
1253773,5,B00002E24F,This movie deserves to be released on DVD!,971395200,4,42,4.375
1253774,5,B00002E24F,"The performances given in this movie were some of the most moving I have witnessed. I felt as if I were there watching that crew train, fight one another, band together as a team and give everything they had to bring the  CSS Hunley to life.
The historical accuracy of this movie is merely  icing on the cake for me. Knowing it is accurate though also makes the  ending that much more gut-wrenching.
I have been waiting for this movie  to come out so I could see it again, I only wish it had been released on  DVD.
Only two words can describe this movie -
INCREDIBLE.  :>)",961372800,10,572,4.25
1253775,5,B00002E24F,"The Hunley was the name of a human-powered experimental submersible developed and employed by the Confederacy during the American Civil War (or ""War Between the States"").  This movie does an excellent job of  explaining the mechanics of the Hunley, but, more importantly, it delves  into the minds and souls of men like those who may have actually manned  her.  As another reviewer aptly pointed out, this movie not only did that,  but presented the southern sailors who manned the Hunley as brave men  rather than as some kind of villains.
The cast is headed by Armand  Assante, the captain of a crew that mans the Hunley, and Donald Sutherland  who is the general in overall command of the project.
Be prepared for a  look into the conflicted and tormented mind of Assante's character -- a  consequence of the loss of his beloved wife.  Assante works as a man  driven, and, at that same time, as one who has nothing to lose.  The  supporting cast does a great job in moving character and story-line  development along.
This is a far superior movie to another period  made-for-TV movie, ""Ironclads"".  ""The Hunley"" is better  in its story development, drama, and acting.  But, if you are a naval  history buff, you should also give ""Ironclads"" a look.
As for  ""The Hunley""...5 stars, an excellent offering, especially for a  made-for-TV movie.

1253776,4,B00002E24F,"Turner Network Television once again brings us a true story of the Civil  War, and like the previous efforts Gettysburg and Andersonville, this movie  is a winner. When the subject of Civil War naval exploits is examined the  battle between the Ironclads Merrimack and Monitor is the first thing that  comes to mind, this film brings us another no less revolutionary story.  Truth is indeed stranger (and more entertaining) than fiction, this is the  story of the Confederate effort to build and deploy a submersible weapon of  war to break the Union blockade of the South Carolina coast. The original  name of this vessel was The David (as in David and Goliath) but after the  training death of a young office named Hunley the sub was renamed. The  opening scene of the training accident will put the hook in you, this is  not a boring film. The special effects are very good, the studio built what  looks to be a realistic copy of the Hunley, if you are claustrophobic this  film will disturb you, even if you are not claustrophobic it will make you  squimish. The technical description of the subs operating procedures (and  it's torpedo) by Lt. Dixon are painfully easy to understand, the  explaination of Union Naval tactics are very clear as well. There is some  computer animation used in the special effects but most of what you see has  a very realistic flavor to it, the Union shelling of Ft. Sumter and  Charleston are good examples of that. Donald Sutherland portraying Gen.  Beauregard has a sinister air about him until he explains his wife's death  in childbirth ""now there is a test for you"" he says. Armand  Assante does a fine job, you may notice some folks complaining about the  accent, don't worry about it, it does not detract from the film, this may  be his best work to date. I would have given 5 stars except for the  ""Hollywoodization"" of the scene about the final plunge. Good  combat scenes, drunken fist fighting, no sex, this would be about a PG-13  film I'd say. Seeing southern soldiers being cast as the ""good  guys"" will remind sub movie affectionados of Das Boot. In this era of  PC where Confederate battle flags are removed, Confederate monuments are  vandalized and Southern heritage is viewed as akin to being a skinhead it  is refreshing that TNT brought us this truly facinating and entertaining  story. I would have bought it on DVD but it was only available on VHS  cassette, which is of fine quality. Top notch production quality. Take it  from me, I like historically accurate war films, this is one of them.",960249600,10,2553,4.701357466063349
1253777,4,B00002E24F,"This is a made for TV dramatization of a true event in history, specifically the story of the Confederate efforts to develop a submersible boat during the civil war. The story opens in Charleston S.C. during the  seize and naval blockade of that city by Federal forces. The Confederates  were attempting to develop a submarine with a torpedo to be used as a  weapon to break the blockade. This is the story of the successes and  failures of that effort and follows the efforts of the crew in the  development of the submarine (made from a converted boiler) and its  ultimate deployment into battle.
The story is a fascinating piece of  history; an event that clearly changed the course of naval warfare.  Director John Gray did a good job in his portrayal of civil war Charleston  during the seize, with citizens attempting to cope and go about the  business of day to day living despite the daily bombardment. The scenes  inside the boat were particularly well done, giving the viewer a good sense  of the claustrophobic quarters in which they had to  operate.
Unfortunately, the selection of Armand Assante for the lead  character, Lt. Dixon was a mistake. Assante, the consummate tough guy, can  be a powerful actor when placed in a suitable role for his skills like  `Gotti'. But he does not have much range outside that type. In this film he  was brittle in his portrayal, playing this role in typical tough guy  fashion when the character required more subtlety and complexity. Also, his  attempt at a southern accent was abysmal. No matter how he tried, he always  sounded like a New York gangster.
Donald Sutherland was good as General  Beauregard, but it was a minor role. The bright spot among the cast was  Sebastian Roche who played Collins, the tempestuous Irishman. His cockiness  and false bravado belied a vulnerable and frightened soul and he played it  perfectly. His portrayal of panic during an oxygen deprivation drill was  riveting.
I gave this film an 8/10, despite the miscasting of Assante. It  was an entertaining drama with plenty of meat to keep most viewers  interested and engaged.",955929600,10,2111,4.824022346368715
1253778,4,B00002E24F,Good movie! By coincidence this movie first aired the Sunday after a trip I took to Charleston S.C. I have always been a civil war buff but had never heard of the Hunley before my trip. I loved the historical accuracy of this  movie and the acting by Donald Sutherland. Armand Assante is accused of  overacting a little. I think he over acted a lot. I would say he hammed it  up even! If you like this movie you should check out the Sea Hunters by  Clive Cussler. He is the author/undersea archeologist that discovered the  wreck of the Hunley in 1995. This book tells about the work finding the  wreck.,948067200,3,603,4.387387387387387

I've not read any accounts of the events portrayed so I can't critique the authenticity but I liked the action, the story and what little character building there was. It was well directed and stayed away from the politics of the American Civil War and focused on the Hunley story as part of America submarine history. Well done.",1474070400,5,527,4.67741935483871

The submarine itself was just awesome, and you really feel the claustrophobic pressure the crew was under, when they took it down into the waters.

As others have said, for the most part, this movie is historically accurate - it's about as historically accurate as you can possibly be when all the principal figures involved with the Hunley drowned, leaving us only the perspectives of the crews and the men involved from those who observed them.

The effects are extremely well done, the filming is excellent, and you really get the claustrophobic feeling of what it must've been like to be in the hellish environment that was the Hunley.  The several sinking scenes are difficult to watch, as it's not easy watching well developed characters drown (several times) but it does once again put you into how desperately determined these men must've been to make this thing work regardless of the previous deaths involved and knowing it would likely kill them as well.

Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Beauregard is a little over-the-top, but, P.G.T. was a colorful character to begin with, so I can overlook a bit of dramatic license taken in that regard.  Bang-for-buck, this is so far the best Civil War nautical themed movie I've seen, so I highly recommend this one.

1253915,5,B00002E24F,"Historically accurate and intriguing film about the first submarine to sink a war ship. The characters are interestingly drawn and the story is well told. I am somewhat surprised that the film is not better known. Maybe it could have been given a better name like ""Death Beneath the Waves"" or ""The Sea is a Sailor's Grave"" or something that appeals to the adventurous side of men.

The submarine, the Hunley, is an old boiler which has been rigged to operate as a submarine. It killed two crews prior to the opening of this story and I personally felt my fear of claustrophobia rise up my backbone when these men got in the submarine--it is almost asking to be killed. They had raw courage and complete dedication to face such danger and suffering.

The Union fleet is off the coast blockading the ports of the Confederacy and it is vital that they break the blockade so they can receive supplies. The scenes of besieged Charleston are well done and communicate the horror of the war visited upon the civilians. I really enjoyed the scene of the bombed out theater when it comes under enemy fire and Assante's character saves the day when he rushes forward and has the band play the Bonnie Blue Flag which rallies the crowd. I like Armand Assante's acting; he did a splendid job. I especially liked his facial expressions. It is amazing what people can communicate with glances.

Donald Southerland did a good job as Beauregard, however I had the impression that he was playing a sophisticated Frenchman from Paris and not one from Louisiana. Maybe he could have studied his character a little bit more. For example, one of the crewmen is learning French because ""it is the language of love"" and he hesitatingly speaks to Beauregard in French and Southerland has a very atypical response. Beauregard being from New Orleans would have spoken to many people who could not speak French or not speak it fluently and he would probably have had a better response than that. It seems to be a typical problem with movies that the French of Louisiana get confused with the French of France.

Likewise the other crew members are presented as real human beings. There is an Irishman who likes to fight and he dislikes the Englishman on the crew. There is a newly-wed man who sends his wife a gift everyday and a 16 year old kid who is the essence of determination. Through time they ""gel"" together and become a team.

I like the fact that the usual anti-southern image of stupid, backward and inept people fighting against competent, reasonable American types is missing. Both sides believed in their causes--that's why the war was so bloody and lasted so long. It is a tribute to Americans that the wounds from the war have been healed to such an extent. Just compare it to the Islamic world where wounds never seem to get healed.

An intriguing story about creative people thinking outside the box and facing difficult challenges. I think it says something good about us as Americans.",1343001600,4,2975,4.700575815738963

George Dixon, played by Actor Armand Assante these men would literally dive into the pages of history when the submerged Hunley attached a torpedo to the U.S.S. Housatonic and blew it up on February 17, 1864. The 1240 ton  enemy ship the USS Housatonic that was on  duty in Charleston's outer harbor  to prevent food and supplies from reaching the new American Confederate Nation.  The film displays Dixon, so the story went, had a beautiful young sweetheart in Mobile, Alabama, named Queenie Bennett. She gave him a U.S. $20 gold piece, which Dixon had in his pocket at the bloody Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee in 1862.  A bullet that could have killed Dixon struck him in the thigh, but the gold coin stopped the slug. The legend said that Dixon had this lifesaving coin from his sweetheart with him the night he went into history with the Hunley.  After seeing this movie the first time I flew out to Charleston to see  the first successful submarine. With the exception of Dixon, however, the names of most of the crewmen who propelled the Hunley to glory were obscured by the mists of time.  This film brings them to life again.  A bent gold coin, inscribed ""Shiloh April 6, 1862 My life Preserver G.E.D"" was found in the Hunley near Dixon's remains.  That coin I saw on display in Charleston.  Great Movie for those who admire the brave American Confederate nation for standing up against the tyranny of the Federal government.  Armand Assante portrays Lt. George Dixon perfectly.

1253947,5,B00002E24F,"Actual research on the now-raised Hunley and its crew suggests some of the information in this historical drama may be incorrect, but its spirit is not flawed.  It shows well the diverse personalities that would come together in one of the landmark projects of Naval warfare in one of the great desperate attempts to turn the tide of the American Civil War toward southern Independence.

By 1864, the Federal blockade had choked the southern Nation dry of almost all imported goods that could not be carried over land afer arriving in Matamoros, Mexico.  The development of a truly practical underwater ""torpedo boat"" that could break the Union blockade was of necessity--blockade runners could not provide sufficient staples let alone war materiel.  It took an ingenious engineer H. L. Hunley and an intrepid group of men to follow a drowned crew to show that underwater stealth warfare on a ship-sinking scale was possible.  Unfortunately, it again yielded deadly results for the crew.

Viewers of the film will see excellent performances, absent the gore of parallel production ""Andersonville""--inspiring in a way that shows why combatants on opposite sides of many conflicts come together many years later in mutual respect and admiration.  Small wonder that tens of thousands attended the final military funeral of the remains of the Hunley crew in 2004, in Charleston, South Carolina, or that a German writer would ask:  ""Where's the DVD?""

While this is a genre of film that does not appeal to everyone, it will appeal to those who wish to understand what the conflict was like on the home front (Charleston), the types of personalities involved (from an apparently non-military crewman to the ambitious Pierre Toutaint Gustave Beauregard, eager to redeem himself after being shuffled off to South Carolina in the wake of failure at Manassas).  Armand Assante puts in a great performance as Lt. Dixon, a part he apparently was not cast for but sought.

All in all, this is much more than a costume drama, and if the viewer will also read the historically accurate accounts of what was found in the actual raised H.L. Hunley craft (e.g. by Mark Ragan), it is an even more worthwhile journey into the past.",1145059200,18,2211,4.997275204359673

1253967,4,B00002E24F,"I purchased and watched ""The Hunley"" to increase my knowledge of this Confederate submarine and her brave crew.  I have been following the actual excavation of the Hunley since it was recovered from the silt of Charleston Bay, and the remains of its crew, including Lt. George E Dixon, have now been found. Right where Dixon's pocket used to be, they found the gold coin given to him by his sweetheart, the coin that stopped a bullet and saved his life at Shiloh, a real event that is presented in the film.
The movie of the Hunley necessarily had to add dramatic and fictional elements, and for the most part, they were enjoyable.  The crew includes an angry Irishman who likes to fight, an Englishman who doesn't, and a groom who misses his wife.  As comic relief perhaps, a young Confederate soldier begs to join the crew and tries to impress Dixon and Beauregard by regularly jumping into the sea fully dressed and splashing about.  He is finally accepted.
Why would a third crew attempt to man the Hunley when two previous crews drowned?  The film answers that by showing the increasing desperation of the residents of Charleston as offshore Union battleships regularly bombard the blockaded city. The only hope of victory over the overwhelming opposing force is to strike an effective blow against the Yankee Navy, and the Hunley does it, sinking the USS Housatonic with a spear-mounted torpedo.  The sub, however, never returned to port, ending the hope for victory. The film speculates as to what might have happened following the Hunley's first and last mission.
Armand Assante is a fine actor, and does a credible job portraying the determined George E Dixon.  However, Lt. George E Dixon, was much younger (in his early 20s), was blonde and over six feet tall.  Knowing that fact did not help me to appreciate Assante's portrayal, as I like authenticity.
At the end of the film I felt both sadness and admiration for the lost crew of the Hunley.  Bravery and valor are not always rewarded with success or fame, but at last the crew has come home for burial.  God bless them.",999302400,40,2085,4.734806629834254

Dixon is haunting, and there is no finer scene chemistry than an emotional scene between this actor and Donald Sutherland, discussing deaths in their respective families.

Every crew who had been assigned to the ill fated sub had perished yet these brave few gave (to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln) their last full measure of courage and patriotism.
As another reviewer had commented, the acting at times is a little cheesy and overdone.  Nonetheless the story is compelling.  Donald Sutherland, as P.T. Beauregard, is fabulous.
For those who enjoy Civil War drama I highly recommend TNT's Andersonville directed by John Frankenheimer.
