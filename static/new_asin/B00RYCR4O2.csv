6936462,1,B00RYCR4O2,"Absolutely AWFUL!

I have been a fan of ""found footage"" films since Blair Witch. I don't really know why, but I like the (genre?)

Anyway, I've watched a number of them, and this is by far the worst. There's no real setup for the movie and no real background for the spooooky haunted house they're investigating. Oh, by the way.. It's not some dilapidated old spooky house (like the cover shows).... In fact, the outside shots make it look like a modular home. Modern interior, etc.. Not spooky whatsoever.

The characters are absolutely forgettable. There is no background and no character building whatsoever -- so you basically don't care what happens to any of the characters.  All the men are played by middle-aged guys whose characters act like they're 14 years old, and if I have to hear the word ""dude"" one more time... Ugh! It's like these actors are going through a midlife crisis and have decided they can still play 'young' characters.

There is no build up. No ""peak"" in the storyline. It just goes on and on.  At one point, there is one character running around with a camera all by himself -- for like 10 minutes -- and he sounds like he's auditioning for adult films, rather than sounding scared. And by the way.. How about running to the neighbors for help, rather than back into the haunted house?

Some of the cuts used for 'disappearing' were entirely laughable -- like the kind you made as a kid with a VHS camcorder. Speaking of VHS... This was supposed to be 2013, not 1998. It's filmed in low-resolution 4:3 aspect ratio. Honestly, most YT videos look better.

It was truly awful. However, some sadistic part of me is just now starting to watch Paranormal Retreat 2. Going to see if perhaps the director learned anything.",1494892800,,1745,4.642857142857143

6936489,1,B00RYCR4O2,"There should seriously be a law against false advertising - false describing movies, seeing that there is with businesses. Even the description that Amazon shows, is terribly written.

""This film footage was found by the Police. Based on actual events."" This movie is not true; it is not showing true events at the time when they happened; like they were trying to make it appear. Seriously, I think spirits wouldn't even associate themselves with this embarrassment. Recording this ""movie"" in a 6 by 8 square, just to make it appear as it were legitimate at the time of the events, wasn't proving anything other than the person filming, needs to update their equipment, seeing that this was shot in 2014. I had to watch (what I could) on my iPad so I could actually see it. The editing was just as terrible. I won't even speak of the ""acting"" because, apparently, there wasn't supposed to be any. . so therefore, there wasn't.

I can't stand the Paranormal Activity movies (2009 and up) and honestly, I would rather be forced to watch the entire set of those movies, be forced to eat liver without potatoes or any water, all the while, a rabid meerkat were in my lap trying to eat my face off. I also wouldn't mind it, if the one that came up with the idea of this, the one that wrote it, go back to school to learn how to write words in a sentence, that makes sense.

Movies that give misleading titles and descriptions, should be held accountable for the time that you've lost in your life, the space you've lost in your brain, the feeling of what you've lost for humanity and most importantly, the waste in space and time for the actual movies that could of been released in their place. I hope my pain and anguish was understood here; it's hard to explain exactly what I felt for this, in writing.

But if you're wanting to try it out, you were warned. Do not expect any laws, Gods or spirits to help you get anything back that you've lost, especially the feeling of guilt and regret for not listening to me on this.",1482192000,13,2021,4.468834688346884

6936498,1,B00RYCR4O2,"Rarely indeed does a movie come along that is so incompetently made, so poorly shot, so ill-thought-out, so ineptly acted, so amateurishly edited, and so embarrassingly awful on all levels that you know, in the midst of the awful suffering of actually watching it, that you're seeing something most people will never experience in their entire lives.  Paranormal Retreat is one such movie.  I have to believe that there must have been some kind of inhumanly dark and brilliant mind that created this because no film could actually be this bad accidentally.  You know how they say that a monkey with a typewriter might theoretically pound out the works of Shakespeare at some point over the course of infinity?  Well, theres even less of a chance that a movie this bad could just blossom into being randomly.

The setup for the film is more well-known than a one dollar hooker at a Shriners convention  paranormal research team investigates a haunted location.  Its supposed to be some old farmhouse, but the place looks pretty modern to me  I know the barn is certainly made of metal.  Anyway, lots of goofy, inane banter ensues as the team eventually finds the actual location.  Its never clear to me whether they are believers or debunkers, but that really doesnt matter.  Weird things start happening almost immediately  especially involving contact with locals (especially a grumpy farmer) who weren't supposed to be there.  Then the ghosts begin to make their presence known.  Its a funny thing about these ghosts  although the characters apparently cant see them, the viewer can plainly see people walking and crawling around doing things.  Maybe I was supposed to pretend that I couldn't see the people?  The filmmakers apparently thought that shooting these ghosts with low-quality cameras in poorly lit conditions make them seem invisible or something.  Who knows what these folks were thinking?  You literally cant see what is going on for at least half of the movie  no one could hold a camera steady.

I could go on and on bashing this film, but I think Ive made my point.  These guys didn't even edit out the parts where actors could be heard laughing off-camera at the end of a couple of scenes.  Lets be clear about one thing, though  this is not one of those so bad they're good bad movies.

It is so low budget, I'm surprised the cast even had the gas money to get wherever they were going. Or maybe they just went round the corner. Who knows or cares?

Sometimes you can hear it, usually not, and mostly you can't see it so who knows what to think? It's so ineptly filmed, if that is the right word, that you lose interest immediately, especially when you see the police notice at the start - filmed on or about March 2013. ON March? Not IN it? All the Keystone Kops had to do was look at the date stamp but everything is beyond everyone involved in this.

6936517,1,B00RYCR4O2,"I watched this movie!

Lately, I've been on a string of bad - no, not bad - HORRIBLE movies. First Witch Graveyard, then Spirit In The Woods, two nights ago it was Haunted - Extended Cut, and last night Paranormal Retreat - Extended Cut. Each time I thought I had found the worse movie possible, yet each subsequent film was somehow worse than the previous.

Paranormal Retreat - Extended Cut.has a very unique plot - a group of men and women who set out to debunk paranormal on-goings at a house in the middle of nowhere. But it turns out that these on-goings can't be explained away on natural conditions, but instead turns out to be real (to their detriment).

I hope this didn't spoil the movie for anyone, but I was so enthralled by the plot that I had to share my enthusiasm with others.

Now that I'm done lying through my teeth (or fingertips), I have to explain that I have nothing against low-budget movies. In fact, they hold a certain fascination for me (must to my wife's dismay). But low-budget movies should still have a coherent plot, charismatic actors and actresses, and some degree of professionalism in the sound and editing. Paranormal Retreat - Extended Cut has NONE of these elements!

The plot was a complete shambles - it was like a diverse group of stories were spliced together. I can't say ""blended"" because that implies an end result that could be considered a ""whole"", no matter how muddled that might be. The first ten minutes were snippets of various film clips with faces popping in and out. Then the main ""plot"", with no explanation as to ""why"" the entourage was there, other than another group of investigators had recently disappeared.

And the main plot drags and drags and drags.

Out of nowhere, two transients appear, trying to break into the house for some reason (food? shelter?), and they are killed (at least, I think so - the camera is always so far away this it's often hard to make out what is happening).

And then - you guessed it - they start being eliminated one by one.

I just realized how much I've typed - much more than this piece of excrement deserves. I'll just mention that the acting is typical of this type of movie, compounded with the characters being completely forgettable. As for the technical aspects, there are a couple of scenes where the camera is laying on the ground, pointing at someones' shins and feet, with the only sound being their breathing. AND THIS GOES ON FOR MINUTES AT A TIME!!!!

6936519,2,B00RYCR4O2,"Paranormal Retreat this is a no-budget, SD video, weekend-shoot by a group of buddies, who I think had a good time just making a weekend horror movie on their SD DVD camera, or maybe their smartphone. So, you'll be watching the video in just a small box on your screen (I snapped a pic to give you some idea of what you'll be watching).

The vid starts with about 10 minutes of bizarre grainy color and hazy black-and-white footage that makes no sense (I'm guessing that's the ""director's extended cut"" footage) - so don't quit before the plot portion of the movie actually starts.

The rest of the video is about some buddies on a very amateurish ghost hunt, checking out a reportedly haunted house. Much of the dialogue is improvised, which made it actually seem that at least the ""buddies"" were actually out on a ghost hunt, especially given how amateurish the camerwork is, etc... They did hire some terrible local actors (crazy local farmer, being the worst), which they actually didn't even need - had they just stuck to their small group, it might have been a slightly more fun experience to sit through.

All in all, it is what it is: a hard to watch (physically, given the SD/low resolution and the shaky camera) video with bad audio, no scares, no thrills... it's really, honestly, just a group of 30-something guys and gals shooting a no-budget horror film on a weekend off from work. It's not ""horrible"" when you know, going in, that it's gonna be an indie effort, shot in SD, and it's got mostly 1-star reviews. So, if you're really, really bored, and have $1.99, and you're looking for an excuse to put off doing the laundry or washing the dog, or you're a 420'er, or you dig these kinds of videos, meh, I've seen worse... and, honestly, it's not utterly, infuriatingly disasterous and doesn't take itself too seriously.
