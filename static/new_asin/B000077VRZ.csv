The movie is soo slow that you may get sleep... Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't see it on television...",1077148800,2,411,4.08641975308642

Fiorento has a good British accent but the story is to dumb and Spacey's friends and the cops are obnoxious, but Farrell was mute maybe for most his part. for Spacey or Farrell fans",1066262400,,416,4.2784810126582276
1801807,1,B000077VRZ,"I waited for over three years for this movie to show up in the United States. It never made it to US theaters, so that should give you a clue.  Miramax knew it was terrible, and made a wise choice to not release it here.
It has to be the worst movie Kevin Spacey ever made. His Irish accent was almost non existant. It looked like he didn't even try to sound Irish (My wife is from Ireland and I lived there for over a year and a half). We have over 30 Irish movies, and this is the worst, BY FAR!
The cover of the DVD says that it is based on a true story. If it was, it was VERY LOOSLY based on the life of Dublin gang leader Martin Cahill. I read the book The General, and also saw the wonderful movie with the same title, starring Brendon Gleeson and Jon Voight, and both were very realistic versions of Cahill's life, and I  highly recommend them!
This movie, however, is very far removed from what actually happened to Cahill and his gang.  Without giving away any of the plot, I will say that much of what takes place in this movie, never could have happened, in real-life Dublin. For one thing, the police (Garda) in this movie, all wore civilian clothing, which makes it hard to distinguish police from crooks or IRA members, who also wore civilian clothing. Very confusing, to say the least, as there were other gangs involved, in addition to The General's.
The crimes, which is where the title comes from, as Cahill (called Michael Lynch in this movie, but WHY?)tries to commit all the crimes, with as little violence as possible. However, some of them actually involved very tricky, well-thought-out plans, which would make him, something of a genius.  In Ordinary Decent Criminal, they are not adequately explained, or portrayed, at all.
Linda Fiorentino plays Lynch's wife, and does a fair job with the Dublin accent, and Colin Farrell, who IS Irish, doesn't have an accent problem, but his part is so small, you hardly notice him. His name and photo, does appear on the cover, but is only there for drawing power.
The only people who should buy this DVD, are die-hard Spacey fans, who will spend any amount of money to to see Kevin in ANYTHING, no matter how bad it is.",1059782400,,2184,4.438902743142145
1801808,1,B000077VRZ,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The original movie ""The General"" was a great movie. Which only make it more difficult to understand how Miramax could have made such a bad movie.
This is a ""Keystone Cops"" style of movie. Do not expect to see a believable or likable character in the movie, only slapstick comedians in laughably bad staged scenes. If you want to see the real version of this movie get ""The General"", not this appalling version.",1047600000,7,460,4.488095238095238
1801809,3,B000077VRZ,". . .more than a review.  This is a good movie.  To me, Kevin Spacey opens a film.  His performances make even a mediocre film worth watching (and owning on DVD).  The story is good, and not everything can be another ""Se7en"" or ""American Beauty.""  Nevertheless, if you are a Spacey fan, check it out.
But my real reason for posting a review was to give the head's up to any Colin Farrell fans out there . . . he's been getting a following lately, and the DVD tries to jump on that by putting him on its cover.  If that entices you to pick it up as you are fresh from seeing his stellar performance in ""The Recruit"" or want more of his hometown accent that was offered as Bullseye, you will be sorely displeased.

Mr. Spacey has been in more than one movie wearing shorts, and his legs didn't look skinny.

1801812,4,B000077VRZ,"Ordinary Decent Criminal was loosley adapted from John Boormans critically acclaimed, The General which told the story of real-life Irish criminal Martin Cahill. In a perfect piece of casting, Kevin Spacey plays Cahill (though is renamed Michael Lynch in the movie), a cocky but likeable Dublin gangster who spent his days robbing the rich, annoying the police and falling foul of the IRA. Spacey puts in a power-packed, beleavable performance though he plays the role as a loveable rogue in contrast to the real Martin Cahill. His Irish accent is a little dodgy at times but makes up for it with his performance. The film is well structured featuring moments of comedy, undertones of gritty realism and plenty of impressive action scenes that makes this well worth a look. Given Spacy amicable support is British T.V actress Helen Baxendale as Lisa in a small but effective role. Recommended.",1040169600,13,893,5.04054054054054

1801824,3,B000077VRZ,"This is a difficult movie to review fairly, because I have seen the vastly superior ""Source Material"" movie ""The General"" which is a fictionalized account of the true-life criminal Martin Cahill of Ireland.  While ""The General"" attempts to stay close to the facts of Martin Cahill's life (with varying degrees of success), this movie (Ordinary Decent Criminal) strays wildly into the fictional, even to the point of changing the character's and business's names.  The movie ""The General"" is a true work of art, and leaves the viewer in a state of emotional impact from what he/she has witnessed, while this movie cheapens and ruins that impact with a ""happy"" ending that lets down the viewer both emotionally as well as intellectually.  Why 3 stars then?  It's kind of hard to say... but i'll attempt it.

WARNING:  Spoilers follow.  If you have not yet seen this film, read no further.

When I started watching this movie, I could tell within the first 10 minutes or so that it was an attempt to re-make ""The General"", and capture the audience's attention and imagination like the original.  However, the beginning of this film is a MESS, with very little character development or emotional connection to the ""protagonist"".  The main character moons the public on the court building stairs, and in the process ""Moons"" the audience of this film at the same time.  Shock and in your face offensiveness replace the magnificent character development of the original, and the movie kind of goes ""sideways"" from there.  This is not to say that this is really a ""Bad"" movie, I did give it 3 stars after all... it's just that it falls SO short of what it could have been.

I found many parts of this film to be interesting and right on... I think that Kevin Spacey was very well cast as the master criminal.  I enjoyed very much seeing the ""Menage a Trois"" polyamorous relationship between the lead character, his wife, and her sister.  Other Amazon reviewers have commented at how much a turn off and unrealistic prospect this relationship is, but having lived in such relationships myself, I can tell you that the movie NAILED it and got the 3-way dynamic down perfectly... I just wish the movie had given this part of the story a little more screen time.

As for the main character's exploits, the movie did at least attempt to capture some of the ""Robin Hood"" essence of Martin Cahill and his gang's various nefarious deeds, and in some ways almost measures up to the original movie ""The General"".  However, in the end this movie REALLY fails the viewer by tacking on a completely ""out of character"" and untrue-to-real-life ending involving a COMPLETELY unrealistic and murderous bank robbery, and a ""happy"" ending that pretty much destroys the emotional impact that the rest of the film has been leading up to.

I guess that wraps it up... if you are a Martin Cahill enthusiast I'd say go ahead and watch this, but keep your expectations low.  If you want to see this for Colin Farrell, you should probably pass this one up... he has about 5 minutes of insignificant screen time.  Anyone else wanting to see this for Kevin Spacey and his (pretty good) role in it, go for it... but PLEASE don't get the idea that it is REALLY based on a ""True Story"" - it is nothing but the faintest shadow of the VASTLY superior account of events, as told in the far superior film ""The General"".",1450742400,,3376,4.699490662139219

1801828,3,B000077VRZ,"Viewers are no strangers to this kind of flick. The romanticizing of a clever heist man with the dogged detective who cannot quite seem to bring him in. Then there's the big job that might, or might not succeed that will either let our hero retire or send him to jail. This is not one of the better outings.

Here's the scoop. Kevin Spacey plays Michael Lynch, a Dubliner who is clever and kind. He pulls off his jobs and no one gets hurt. He's married (to Linda Fiorentino) with kids but also has a loving relationship with his sister in law. His wife is fine with that. Detective Noel Quigley (Stephen Dillane) has arrested Lynch and gotten him into court but Lynch always prevails. Now Lynch is after the big score involving a highly priced piece of art. Will he win the day or land in jail?

This is a fun enough romp. I like Spacey and he has a notable crew with veterans Peter Mullen, David Hayman and Colin Farrel. This must have been early in Farrel's career as he is little more than window dressing. I suppose it is curious that two of the main characters, Spacey and Fiorentino are from the states. I guess the Weinstein boys had their sights set across the pond. Anyway...this is just Okay. A bit diverting I suppose but it needed to be more clever and needed more tension. I never doubted the outcome. And since this has been done before that is something the writer/producers/director should have attended to. And something happens in the climax (that the outcome relies on 100 %) and so iffy I cringed that it was included at all.

Like I said. It's watchable and you like the characters well enough. Just don't get your hopes up.",1401753600,,1645,4.458471760797342

And if it's based on a real crook, of which I was not aware, it must be loosely based. When the film began, I actually thought I might become accustomed to the cute antics of the people involved but at the end, I decided they, especially Spacey, was too cute for my taste.",1385596800,,547,4.269230769230769

He makes the movie, hands down. I think the accents were all right but apparently they weren't Dublin, as the audiences on youtube have often proclaimed but a mix of American, Swedish, Scottish, and British.

1801847,4,B000077VRZ,"Thaddeus O'Sullivan who directed the Irish troubles movie ""Nothing Personal,"" ""December Bride"" & has ""Shadow Chaser"" with Samuel L. Jackson coming out next year guides ""Ordinary Decent Criminal"" with a light hand.  While the most memorable scene may be Kevin Spacey mooning the police, it would also be correct to say that O'Sullivan keeps the tone firmly ""tongue in cheek.""  This gangster film is a light romp filled with more witty banter than gunfire.  Spacey does an excellent job as the criminal iconoclast Michael Lynch who probably is smart enough to hold a regular job, but is just too original to put up with it.  He is married to Christine played by Linda Fiorentino.  She doesn't have a lot to do in the film, but she does love art and draws Lynch into the love of a particular Caravaggio.  Helen Boxendale who was on a number of ""Friends"" episodes plays sister ""Lisa"" who also is kind of ""married"" to Lynch.  They have their separate households and the sisters get along perfectly well sharing their man.  The gag culminates when the police think they've killed Lynch whose face has been blown off by bullets.  As they un-drape the corpse and reveal his private parts, knowing glances between the sisters let them know that it's not Lynch.  Peter Mullan who won a Best Actor award at Cannes for ""My Name Is Joe"" plays Stevie.  Stephen Dillane plays the Detective Sergeant Quigley who seems to routinely get stumped by Lynch.  Dillane became a favorite actor of mine in a romantic film called ""Firelight.""  Last but not least is the role of Alex played by Colin Farrell.  In what was his 2nd film before ""Tigerland"" broke him as a Hollywood commodity, he does a decent job with few lines of trying to rip off the painting.

The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!

The rating could have been PG-13, as there's no serious reason really for an R rating.

In short, it's a movie definitely worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might want to stop short of buying it.

1801850,4,B000077VRZ,"Robbers and Cops, September 5, 2005Reviewer: Grady Harp (Los Angeles, CA United States) - See all my reviews

ORDINARY DECENT CRIMINAL has to be one of the more tongue-in-cheek titles Hollywood has devised for a story apparently based on a real life infamous Irish gangster Martin Cahill whose claim to fame was robbing banks and getting away with it while posing as a preceptor of family values! Yet in this reincarnation the plot is suffused with comedy and typical capers and served up by a fine cast on a shaky platform.

Michael Lynch (Kevin Spacey, always terrific to watch even in uneven films) is a 'gentleman robber', married to two sisters (Linda Fiorentino and Helen Baxendale) whose latest criminal diversion involves the theft of a Caravaggio painting. How he utilizes his cohorts and evades the police headed by Noel Quigley (the extraordinarily gifted actor Stephen Dillane who played Stephen Woolf in 'The Hours'). The cast is good and makes the best of a confusing arc of storyline written by Gerard Stembridge. Director Thaddeus O'Sullivan keeps things moving along but slides into some boring and non-additive variances from the plot and character development that threaten to grind down the film. Tack on a corny ending not in keeping with the real character on whose life the story is based and the recipe for lack of success in the theaters is obvious.

But keep the expectations low and this film will entertain. Sad that for its distribution in the USA the cover of the DVD lists Colin Farrell as one of the stars (Spacey, Fiorentino, Farrell) which says a lot about PR grossness: Farrell is a VERY minor extra here and should any other actor be listed in top billing it is Stephen Dillane! Not a great heist film but it's always good to see more of Spacey. Grady Harp, September 05",1125878400,3,1806,4.819354838709677
