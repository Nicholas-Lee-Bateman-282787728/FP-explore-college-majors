The exercises do not require weights, so anyone can do them while sitting in a chair. This would be easy to incorporate into one's daily routine.",1388534400,,260,4.326530612244898
7924305,5,B00004W1AU,"I have trouble with my feet and with my health, so the title caught my attention.  It's perfect for helping me get the gentle ""workout"" I need.  It covers all muscle groups, and I really do feel better afterward.  Also, no music or hype, just 20 direct minutes of good motion.  Short enough that I can keep consistent with it.

Now that I know the routine, I can do the exercises watching with the sound off, while I listen to music or a program on the radio.  I recommend it to anyone who is challenged with mobility or their joints, and wants to keep fit enough to keep active, instead of becoming progressively less so!

I regret the ""smart-aleck"" comments I read on 2 or 3 other reviews.  Does harm to those who want honest feedback so they can find an activity customized for their capacity.",1373760000,4,796,4.404109589041096

7924307,1,B00004W1AU,"getting flabby like an intermediate care resident, I ordered a copy of ""Chair Fitness Volume #1"".

Since a new copy was $999.99, I went the cheap route, and bought a used copy for $999.99.

I was really excited when I learned ""Chair Fitness Volume #1"" was rated by Amazon as #344,116 in Movies & TV.

I popped it into my office VHS player, and was looking forward to 20 minutes of gentle, low key, fun and effective workouts including warm up, resistance training, cool down and stretch from my ergonomic chair. Blanche was going to become my personal trainer and perform each exercise along with me and add encouragement and guidance.

I was using my 375 pounds of body weight for resistance through simple joint application. Unfortunately, my joints were a soundtrack of ligaments snapping so fast and in such numbers, it was like setting off Chinese firecrackers in a bowl of Rice Krispies.

If you want a ""gentle, low key, fun and effective workout"" that inflicts ridiculous amounts of damage to your load-bearing joints, and includes a trip to the ER, buy this tape.",1343433600,9,1071,4.767567567567568
7924308,2,B00004W1AU,"I first got this tape as a belated Christmas present from my wonderful son, Joshua. It worked wonderfully for the first 10 years, but I must admit that in the last four, it's become so blurry and grainy that it's hard to see anymore. Luckily, I have most of it memorized so it's usually not a problem. There's one part where the tape got so worn out it broke, and I had to use clear sticky tape to put it back together. Sometimes, it gets stuck there, and it can take me a good 15 minutes to ease out of my chair and go pull the tape out to forward it manually and put it back in. I did notice that now my television seems to have that image on the screen even when it's off, maybe from being on there so long? It's a bit awkward because it's a shot of Mrs. Black doing outward leg lifts, but it's okay. I was really hoping to find Chair Fitness Volume 2 today to buy (my grandson Christopher just installed AOL internet for me last month, and do I love ordering from amazon! great prices on ensure) but I may just order a new copy of this tape if I have to.  If you have Volume 2 you would like to sell me, please email me BestGran3Flowers55@aol.com",1343433600,30,1150,4.088495575221239
7924309,1,B00004W1AU,"I purchased the video in the hopes of getting some good chair fitness as the cover so ominously promised, and was severely dissapointed: not even one of the chairs I tried it with got any fitter.  I even measured them before and after.  My hopes of being able to fit my chairs hidden behind the fridge for when my mother in law decides to visit are gone.

One more thing.  This ""VHS"" thing's plastic box is a pain to pry open, and once you do, the tape unrolls too easily, which in turn is a pain to fit inside my Blu Ray player.  I want to think this is a compatibility problem because of me using a PS3 to read the video instead of a regular Blu Ray player and not having been sold a defective product.",1343433600,52,704,4.109489051094891
