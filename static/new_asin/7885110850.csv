7900245,4,7885110850,"This is a very interesting survey of recent archaological discoveries of the great historical kilns of fabulous ancient Tang and Sung potteries and porcelain.
The two- disc DVD goes into great details on the various styles, colors, shapes, and  functions  of chinese ceramics.  The  findings across various sites  provide evidence of the vast richness and variety of products made for the royal families as well as for the general public.
These discoveries will provide much knowledge and bases for research to recover some of the lost artistic techniques in chinese ceramics.
 A museum goer will  gain extra appreciation knowing the background of the pieces displayed.
An art collector may  find the chronological archaological finds useful in evaluating the ""antique"" wares available for sale, where fakes and false claims abound.",1346976000,,832,5.395348837209302
