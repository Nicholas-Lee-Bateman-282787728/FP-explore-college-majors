2694234,3,B000KLQUMG,"Melissa Joan Hart could have done so much better than Sabrina the Teenage Witch. She stars opposite an animatronic cat. Maybe if I were younger, Sabrina would have been cool. Instead, the show was just kind of annoying. Especially Salem the cat. What teenager wants to watch a fake cat? Instead, I think the show was geared towards 10 year olds.",1168646400,,345,4.672131147540983
2694235,5,B000KLQUMG,"I cant believe they finally came out with the complete first season of Sabrina, i love this show and cant wait till all the seasons come out. i am going to be buying them all!!!!",1168473600,3,178,4.114285714285714
2694236,5,B000KLQUMG,"Sabrina, The Teenage Witch is the one of my favorite tv series I've ever watched. I'm remembering ""Clarissa"" character on nick, when Melissa Joan Hart was a teen girl.

Now, I'm not a teenage boy anymore, little grown up. But I'm still missing those days, teen pop music explosion age all around.

I've been waiting for this DVD release for a long time. Now finally thanks God , this day comes. I hope I'll get this DVD as soon as possible.

Thanks for this DVD once again, will impatiently waiting for next seasons on DVD releases. Great!!!!",1167782400,6,542,4.56701030927835
2694237,5,B000KLQUMG,"Unlike some on this board, I actually have watched this series from the beginning and unlike some on this board know of which I speak so I feel free to comment on this superb series.  Based on the Archie comic book character, Sabrina Spellman turns 16 and finds out she is a witch (ok, half witch, half mortal) and her life is turned upside down.  Warmly played by Melissa Joan Hart (who was meant to be Sabrina) the show is funny, charming, fast paced and timeless.  Quite an accomplishment but it stands up to time.  Supporting roles of Aunt Hilda (Caroline Rhea in great comic form) and Aunt Zelda (Beth Broderick at her loveliest) are on the mark.  And show-stealing feline Salem Saberhagen is delightfully witty.  Sabrina faces the challenges of living in a mortal world and juggling her secret witchcraft powers as well as just trying to be a 'normal' teenager.  There are some creative moments as well as many surprise guest stars that 'pop' in and out.  The supporting cast were well chosen and the storylines are perfect for the young (and us not-so-young) to enjoy over and over again.  Yes, it's a treat to finally have this on DVD.  I highly recommend this series to anyone.  Buy and enjoy!
And for a real treat - there are also 50+ paperback books based on the Sabrina the Teenage Witch tv series (and Salem Tales for us feline lovers) that are companions to the show.  A perfect compliment to the dvd and well worth reading.  I highly recommend.",1167436800,11,1459,4.586872586872587
2694238,5,B000KLQUMG,"I initially remember watching Melissa Joan Hart back in 1994 when she was in ""Clarissa Explains It All"" on Nick, and what a wonderful show it was! Then she starred as Sabrina in ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"", where she was on every TGIF on ABC, and eventually her show got moved to WB 20. The show brough meaning and comfort to my life. No matter what age you are, the show will bring out the magical moralistic lessons b/w right and wrong. I have been waiting 2 years for the dvd series (since the show ended in 2005). Finally the magical prayer is heard!!! Thanks amazon!!!",1167436800,5,574,4.4245283018867925
2694239,5,B000KLQUMG,"I'll just say that I'm a Melissa's fan since a few years now. So, as I was reading the series would come up on DVD, I couldn't wait to place my order...

It's just... almost like a dream come true! (Thanks to whoever made this possible).

2694265,3,B000KLQUMG,"Perfect example of a great concept ruined by Hollywoodism.
The movie that came before the series was a fairly lame and very typical 'Cinderella' story type thing with a little bit of magic thrown in as a gimmick, the TV series was actually a little bit livelier than the movie, but so 'schlocky' and 'schticky', it's actually a little hard to watch, or, more precisely, hard to listen to.
Which isn't the fault of the actors, they do a fine job (for the most part), the blame lies squarely with the script writers.
Supposedly, a reboot of the movie is in the works, but I fear they'll screw that up, too, and in the usual, very predictable ways.",1510963200,,645,4.47457627118644

The acting is solid for how silly the show is. It's funny that I can say the talking cat is a great actor! Ha! Melissa was always someone I liked when I was younger. Had that high school crush on her and she's just a delight to watch! If you haven't ever watched it before, it may seem a little dated.

2695162,4,B000KLQUMG,"This is the only season of this show that is worth watching, if you ask me!  The acting is presentational in nature, which can be really off-putting, but the writing is just so darn clever that it makes all the cheese worthwhile.  The jokes flew clear over my head when I was a kid and this show was new, but when I went to re-watch it as an adult (with my sister and largely for nostalgia value), I was blown away by the intelligence and originality of the one-liner zingers and jokes, which are always delivered with a perfectly straight face.  A primary writer apparently died during the season, which probably explains the severely sharp decline in quality from season 1 to season 2.",1449100800,,687,4.524193548387097

A teenage girl finding out she's extraordinary, a half witch, although she's part human and she will age, her aunts that are full blooded witches they look the same. They've lived thru the centuries. My favorite characters are Salem the cat and Harvey. Harvey was Sabrina's first love, he finds out that she's a witch at the end of season 4, that's how the officially broke up. Sorry for the spoilers. I'm just saying. And Salem the cat is hilarious. His role served to be the aunts familiar cat. But he was once in human form but later turned into cat due to his narcissistic persona. He wanted to take over the world. Anyways I hope y'all enjoy the show!",1447113600,,685,4.4015748031496065

After watching all the seasons, I wonder why they can't make these kind of shows anymore. I love how they used different sets and had witty dialogue and the witch thing allowed them to get very creative. I also like how there was always a moral lesson to be learned and it was not just about trying to shock you and impress you with fancy special effects. I also liked how they weren't trying to just use cleavage or crude humor to bump up their ratings. When will the cast return and continue this magnificent journey???!!!!!!!!",1437609600,8,652,4.396694214876033

Some of the content is questionable at times, I assume to appeal to a middle school crowd.  I was surprised two boys mentioned they were virgins in the second episode (during the truth sprinkles episode), but aside from that would rate it PG.

2695445,5,B000KLQUMG,"One of my favorite seasons of Sabrina The Teenage Witch is Season One. Here you are introduced to sixteen year old Sabrina Spellman who moves in with her aunts, Hilda and Zelda Spellman, who have a huge announcement for her on her birthday -- she's a witch! Like life isn't any harder for a teenager in a new hometown, she lives with a black cat named Salem who talks and has been turned into a witch's familiar for trying to take over the world. Everything about this season is magical from the celebrity cameos (i.e. Raquel Welch) to great music guests (i.e. Violent Femmes). What would have made the DVD even better would be the great musical sequences but due to copyright issues there are generic songs put in place. However, nothing can destroy the laughs and fun of this show!",1436918400,,783,4.560283687943262

However I cant in good conscience give this collection 5 stars considering the massive edits to the music and certain scenes.

Its ridiculous to say something is the complete series when its INCOMPLETE in the first place.

After discovering the amount of edits to this show I'm writing the  people who did this.

This is absolutely pathetic period.

Whatever you do people do NOT buy the complete series the amount of edits in this collection is beyond the pale and a true slap in the face to the fans.

2695704,5,B000KLQUMG,"I already own all the episodes and two movies on DVD, but so glad I can lazily switch between my favorite episodes on Amazon instead of having to switch discs! Sabrina is definitely my favorite childhood TV series along with Malcolm in the Middle. I will admit that Sabrina is super cheesy sometimes but I can't help but love this show. It's witty sarcasm and frequent use of puns and irony never get old to me. Every episode is centered around some theme and ends with a moral. While I love shows like Orange is the New Black or True Blood, it's always refreshing to go back and watch something that's super cute, funny and lighthearted. Something that makes you feel good instead of questioning your faith in humanity.",1420675200,,720,4.589147286821706

I stumbled upon this, late at night, while flipping the channels, on my remote. It was airing on Nicholodeon and the '-n- Channel', in re-runs. I immediately enjoyed. I nearly became a Melissa Joan Heart / Sabrina Groupie.

Ciao!  :)  Bella

It is great to see the first season with the pilot episode and to see how the characters and the situations evolved. We love all the additional characters, especially the somewhat sarcastic, talking cat ""Salem"". Looking forward to viewing the remainder of season 1 and all the episodes of the subsequent seasons--just in time for the 2014 Halloween season!",1412985600,,575,4.818181818181818

2695891,5,B000KLQUMG,"I loved this series when I first saw it in the later 1990's. As I recall, it ran from 1996 to 2003.

It is more than the adventures of a teenage witch in high school (four seasons) and college (three seasons), living with her two aunts because her witch father is stuck in a book of magic, and unable to live with her mother for the first two years of her training due to her mom's mortality interfering somehow with her blossoming, just discovered, powers.

The show is a commentary on how the gifted student often has trouble fitting in at school, the troubles he has getting along with his peers, getting teased by the jocks and cheerleaders, and not having outlets for average recreation with others.

Yes, many of the comedic situations have mainly to do with how people see the results of the witchcraft then try to explain it away. The principal especially provides some comic relief, especially when he dates one, then the other aunt for awhile.

With this review, I am reviewing all seven seasons of Sabrina. The first two seasons were better than the third and fourth, in my humble opinion, then when she got into college and moved into a house with several other students, the plots brightened back up again because there were new situations to be explored.

Seasons 1-2: Five Stars
Seasons 3-4: Four Stars
Season 5: Five Stars
Seasons 6-7: Four Stars

If you enjoy comedy, and you enjoy witchcraft that sometimes goes wrong, and you enjoy seeing different views of life, then get these sets. I wouldn't have paid for them, but I was delighted to get them ""free"" as a perk of my membership in Amazon Prime.",1405382400,,1617,4.597222222222222

2695924,4,B000KLQUMG,"Ok, a lot depends on how you define ""kids"".  This is probably targeted to 'tweens.  I'm sure most parents would allow kids 10 and over to watch and perhaps some as young as 8.

The show is about a sixteen year old girl, Sabrina, who finds out that she is a witch.  She lives with her two aunts and a talking cat.  She must learn about her powers while at the same time struggling through typical teen issues at school.  Her two aunts are witches that help her in both areas.  As a teen, Sabrina doesn't always make the best decisions but that provides the learning opportunities in the show much like they do in real life.  There's a moral lesson in each episode, which is a good thing.

While I didn't find the show all that funny, it was entertaining.  I watch television with my child to provide parental guidance so it's a big bonus if the show is actually entertaining.  Don't get me wrong, there are funny parts (especially to the younger generation, I guess), but I don't think it's the main driver of this show.  For an older show, I thought it was pretty good.",1401494400,,1069,4.343434343434343

Considering Amazon advertises over 40,000 movies and TV shows, I looked through them, found a few I wanted to watch only to find they took them off Prime before i got to watch them.

I don't know if this is because streaming through the wii, it is trying to upscale to HD, or what, but I am not at all happy about the video quality.

And yes, I know it is by now out-dated; however, I still hold this series in my top 5 TV sitcoms.  Salem, the talking, selfish cat who seeks world domination is my favorite ""character"".  His one liners and quick wit provide comic relief even when the show addresses more serious concerns.  Season 1 of Sabrina starts with Sabrina gaining her powers and learning that she is a witch.  Amid this revelation, she also has to deal with typical teen problems at home and at school.  This is a great show and many people (especially teen-aged individuals) would relate to Sabrina and the trials/troubles/joys she encounters.  I mean, who wouldn't want to use their ""special powers"" to turn the snobby girl at school into a pineapple?",1336089600,3,866,4.535483870967742

She is 18 now, going to college, hyper-intelligent, and someone who embraces all things odd, especially in dress, wild hair colors, occasional piercings and other counter-culture proclivities. Dark, dark poetry and depressing literature by crazy people are her thing. Not a bad kid by any means, just ""different"".

So, it warmed my heart when she asked me for this. She said that for 7 years of her youth, this was her favorite show. Simple, wholesome, fun. She got her wisdom teeth extracted a few days ago and while recuperating, she devoured this entire first-season set in a matter of days. She said it was still one of her favorites and that it held up really well. She laughed and giggled and felt like a kid again. It didn't have to be cool - it just had to be what it was.

Now I know Sabrina really does possess magic.

Buy this for your kids if they are too young to have caught it before.",1315267200,3,930,4.458823529411765
2696330,5,B000KLQUMG,"I have seen seasons 1,2, and 3 and four. The actors who play the characters are great, including Salem the cat who is voiced by Nick Bakay. Season 1 is about Sabrina Spellmen (Melissa Joan Hart) who doesn't realize that she is a now a witch. So, her two aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick) begin by having her live with them. As the 1st season goes on, every episode always has some interesting scene in it when it comes to magic spells. Harvey (Nate Richert) who happens to be Sabrina's new friend, is a neat character and also is charming and adorable. As season 1 ends, new characters and episodes came. Sabrina then gets another new friend Valerie (Lindsay Sloane) who is interesting and understands Sabrina. As the 2nd season moves on, a lot happens then in the 1st one. Season 1 is a starter because the episodes show a lot about a teenage witch meeting a friend and a neat guy to be friends with. S2 is a bit like S1, but it is twice as fun because there is always on episode to laugh at. Through the middle part of S2, a lot of things get funnier, I don't think that there are any dull moment in S2 because whenever something happens, Sabrina always wants to have fun with her magic. But also she has to learn that from her aunts that not everything can be her way when it comes to magic. Instead her aunts want her to listen to them when it comes to little choices and so forth. As S2 ends, Valerie gets close to Sabrina as a friend, and Harvey and Sabrina start a steady relationship dating.
Season 3 is very interesting and yet a real fun season with surprises. Sabrina gets to work in this season by going through quizes, tests and going on trips to the other realm to get her Witches license. Although, some of the episodes are not always to funny, still S3 is quite like the 1st two. Libby (Jenna Leigh Green) is a rival of Sabrina's who is in S1, S2 and S3 of the show itself. She is the popular girl, cheerleader, Libby on the other hand shows herself as an interesting figure in the show as someone who not only get as much attention as Sabrina does, but also she seems, but shows a little charm into not starting conflicts with Sabrina, instead deals with Sabrina's part of showing that she is more than the popular girl to. In fact Libby is in most of the episodes in the three seasons. In Season 2-3, Sabrina is encouraged to discover the family tree by having clues about each family secret there is for her to know. The end of S3 is pretty good, the episodes are basically when Sabrina reveals teh family secret, she tells Harvey that she loves him after he tells her that he loves her. The last few shows of season 3 are really funny.",1295913600,,2676,4.311507936507937

2696342,4,B000KLQUMG,"Sabrina Spellman's (Melissa Joan Hart) life is changing.  She's just moved in with her aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick) and is starting a new school.

But that's not all.  On her sixteenth birthday, Sabrina learns that she is a witch who is just starting to get her powers.  So not only does she need to fit in at school, but she needs to hide her powers for fear of being labeled a freak.  And there's the fact that their cat Salem talks (voiced by Nick Bakay).

On her first day of school, she quickly makes friends with idealistic Jenny (Michelle Beaudoin) and develops a crush on Harvey (Nate Richert).  Unfortunately, she also draws the distain of head cheerleader Libby (Jenna Leigh Green).  And she has to survive biology with Mr. Poole (Paul Feig).

This school year will be anything but easy as she turns Libby into a pineapple, learns that messing with her friends lives can cause terrible things to happen, makes a magician invisible, gets trapped in a mirror of her own bad mood, turns Harvey into a frog when they kiss, and faces her own worst fear when Libby accuses her of being a witch while on a field trip to Salem, Massachusetts.  Who ever said being a witch was easy?

I actually started watching this show with season two, but have caught season one multiple times in reruns.  Maybe it's because I started later, but I've never found this to be one of my favorite seasons.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of laughs.  But it just seems a bit like the show is still finding its feet.  Of course, that is pretty normal for many shows in their first year.

This show definitely falls into the fantasy category, and it creates its magical world well.  I do laugh quite a bit at the situations Sabrina gets into over the course of the season.  The acting is good.  Most of the special effects work, although a few are a little obvious, especially the puppet version of Salem in the early episodes.

This set contains all 24 episodes from the season on four discs.  There are no bonus features, although the full frame picture and stereo sound look and sound great.

There isn't anything serious about this show, but it isn't trying to be serious.  Instead, you'll get a funny show set in a creative fantasy world.",1217203200,,2256,4.543424317617866

2696347,4,B000KLQUMG,"I loved this show so much!  Developed from a high-rating Showtime Network telemovie, SABRINA: THE TEENAGE WITCH was one of the most popular sitcoms of the late-90's, starring Melissa Joan Hart in the title role.  Based around the Archie Comics spin-off, Sabrina Spellman lives with her two wacky aunts Hilda and Zelda in the tight-knit town of Westbridge.  Sixteen years old and about to start a new school, Sabrina's life is complicated enough, until Hilda and Zelda reveal that her father is a warlock and, as such, Sabrina too has magical powers.  Life as a half-mortal doesn't come easily (for most of the first episode, all Sabrina can conjure is pineapples!), but gradually she learns the ""tricks"" of her trade.

Melissa Joan Hart is a perky and appealing heroine; her performance as Sabrina glues the whole premise together and gives believability to even the most outlandish plot.  Co-starring as Sabrina's well-meaning aunts, Caroline Rhea (Hilda) and Beth Broderick (Zelda) are total scene-stealers with their comic ""odd couple"" dynamic.  Nate Richert plays Sabrina's faithful boyfriend Harvey, and Michelle Beaudoin is her best friend Jenny.  Jenna Leigh Green is snooty arch-rival Libby.  Nick Bakay provides the voice of Salem, the Spellman family cat, who is actually a warlock forced to spend 100 years as a feline after his attempt at global conquest!

The first season of SABRINA: THE TEENAGE WITCH was marked by top performances from a well-picked ensemble cast, witty scripts and imaginative scenarios.  Gradually, as with any top-rating show, the quality seemed to degrade over subsequent seasons (and died a slow death as Sabrina moved on to college 6 years later--without most of the main cast and completely devoid of charm).  Happily, now fans can relish this show when it was at it's freshest and most appealing, with this set of the complete first season.

VIDEO:

Woohoo! The vision is crystal clear and presented in full screen format just like on the TV but the quality is much better.

AUDIO:

Disappointing!!!! Most of the episodes have all audio in tact but due to copyrights and the likes there are SOME episodes where the music soundtrack has been changed. The audio is presented stereo sound so good quality for the audio options aswell.

EXTRAS:

NOT A SINGLE ONE!!! This is VERY disappointing as I feel that after making us wait so long for this on DVD they could of put SOMETHING on here even a five minute interview with Melissa Joan Hart, a behind-the-magic feature or SOMETHING!!!

SUMMARY:

Sabrina, the Teenage Witch is a great show. It's funny, light-hearted and the casting is spot on-- Melissa Joan Hart like MANY greats was MADE just to play the cute, dizzy and lovable Sabrina.

The boxset is fairly AVERAGE however. Yes it is packaged well (the front picture is golden magic looking, the discs are a light sparking silver and the single case is a great space-saver without effecting the discs what-so-ever) but the lack of extras is disappointing and I only hope with the realease of Season 2 around the corner they might even pop-on the made-for-TV movies.",1178496000,6,2821,4.797916666666667

It is Entertaining Watching Her Try To get Out Of The Situations She Gets Herself Into. Can't Wait For Future Seasons To Be Released,1175558400,4,479,4.161290322580645
2696361,5,B000KLQUMG,"I used to watch this show when I was younger and I remember being really into it, which is why I bought the first season. It was way better than I remembered. Each episode is so hilareous due to clevar writing and a witty cast. Libby, the mean popular girl, is by far one of the funniest characters and the things Sabrina does to get back at her are hugely entertaining. The Aunts are some of the best supporting characters in sitcom history. My family and I watched the whole sitting in three days. We became semi-addicted to it, plus it flys by so fast. Each episode is paced so well that it's not to fast, but it never gets boring. It's a perfect blend of everything you could want in a family friendly sitcom. This is not just for kids or teens, it's for everyone. I can't wait until Season 2 gets released in July and I hope Paramount eventually releases the entire series.

The worst thing about this release is that there are no bonus features. Not even a commentary or a cast retrospective. I still give it 5 stars because the complete series was what I bought it for, but it would have been nice to have Melissa Joan Hart come back and talk a little bit about the show. I mean, it was such a big part of her life. As other people have pointed out, some of the music isn't original due to copyright issues. I can't remember any of the original music from when I used to watch the show, but I didn't think any of the songs sounded out of place, so for the average viewer like me, it shouldn't distract from your enjoyment of the DVDs.

One of the best things about this season set besides the show itself is the case. I have run out of room for big season box sets. Even though this is a 4-disc set, it comes in a standard DVD case. The case is like your standard 2-disc case, but there is a DVD on each side of the physical case and a hinged plastic flap holds the other two discs very nicely. I shook it around and none of the discs flew off their hinges. Very nice packaging.

I highly reccomend this season to everyone. No matter who you are (guy, girl, old, young) you are sure to find something entertaining in ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch.""",1175126400,36,2152,4.231143552311435

2696363,5,B000KLQUMG,i must be the most insane sabrina fan there is...ever since i was little and there was TGIF on abc on friday nights i used to record sabrina on VHS and watch them over and over for years...then when tv shows started coming out on dvd i wondered why so many stupid shows were out in seasons and not sabrina...when i found out that sabrina repeats were on fox family and noggin i got t-vo and recorded and saved all the high school year episodes...for the past 2 years or more i would be checking on amazon and searching to maybe find out that sabrina was coming out on dvd...finally about 2 months ago i saw that it was coming out on march 6th...and i really couldn't believe it...i pre-ordered it and counted down the days until it was released...i cannot wait for the rest of the seasons to come out and i hope it doesn't take as long as this one did!,1173744000,3,852,4.233128834355829
2696364,4,B000KLQUMG,"Oh, man, I'd been hoping and hoping for this first season set to find its way to DVD for a while now, and it is finally here!

I know that my age group or gender probably was not the intended audience for this series, but it captured me after a few episodes in its original run on TV.  it works on the level it is supposed to work, but there are so many sly representations of golden age TV in this series that I just could not pull myself away--there is even an appearance by my generation's favorite kids' show host, Chuck McCann in a cameo on what is one of my favorite episodes of the first season, in which Sabrina's best friend, Jenny Kelly, stays with Sabrina for a weekend and curiously finds her way into that closet that sends her, a mortal, into the Other Realm where she meets up with the wonderfully smug and nasty Head of the Witches' Council, played with just the right amount of grease by Penn Gillette, and his secretary who, I believe, is actually played by Debra Harrie of Blondie!!

And this brings up how much I adored the character of Jenny Kelly, a nonconformist free spirit who stands out as a great supporting player in this first season and, if such things are truly important, a good role model to the intended audience!  If only Sabrina, herself, listened carefully to Jenny's philosophy, she'd have gotten through her realization that she is ""different"" so much easier.  Jenny is played so enjoyably by Michelle Beaudoin and helps make this first season well worth the money.

My only real complaint about the package, here, as it appears on DVD for the first time, is that all original pop songs have been removed from the key episodes, even though, thankfully enough, the appearance of the Violent Fems remains intact on yet another wonderful episode in which Aunts Hilda and Zelda become teen-agers again to escort Sabrina on a trip with an unlikely bunch of schoolmates to meet and greet their favorite band at a local record shop.  The impressions of the aunts as angst-ridden teens, having to go through the trials and tribulations, first hand all over again is utterly hilarious!  Don't overlook this series' first season as just kids' media.  Those writing the scripts were truly writing from memories of their own younger days, as evidenced in the afore-mentioned episode, and not only is Michelle Beaudoin as jenny (who only appeared in this season) a breath of fresh air here, but it is also fun to watch jenna Leigh Green as smarmy Libby Chessler; in fact, there are times when she is almost a bit lovable.  There is an episode in which Miss Green has to play Sabrina disguised as Libby as well as Libby herself and she comes close to stealing the spotlight away from Melissa Joan Hart who plays the title character.

But, again, why remove those pop songs?  usually, I'm screaming about how great musicians often see their good songs misused in bad TV sitcoms, but the songs used for this season were not intended to delegitimize the tune.  In an episode about a day when Sabrina's mood grew darker, it was fun to hear REM's ""Shiny, Happy People"" since I always thought that Michael Stipe was writing with his tongue somewhat in his cheek, or Liz Phair's song used on the Violent Fems episode as Sabrina takes off into the air on her first vehicle, a flying vacuum cleaner.  Since Ms. Phair writes with a spikey sense of humor, I would have thought that she would not have minded the inclusion of her song here!  The music substituted was okay, but I'm a stickler for keeping things the way they were when we first were introduced to the show in question, and the inclusion of the afore-mentioned tunes and others were what gave this season of this series a hint of real coolness above other shows aimed at the same core audience on those Friday nights.

But all the great scenes are here and I urge those of you, like me, who called this show their guilty pleasure to check this out.

next time, though, leave the music be, and please give us some great special features!  Didn't anybody connected with this series have the occasional fond memory to share?  Give yourselves a big hand, here.  It worked and this is the best representation of it all!!",1173571200,15,4193,4.587684069611781

It has circulated through the cable networks constantly since before the series finished its original network run, often on more than one cable oulet at a time. I hope this long exposure does not suppress DVD sales and discourage future releases. The show was great in the first season, but really hit its stride in season 2.

I always watched the show (yeah TGIF!) during its original airing, and I still catch a re-run now and again; I still love the it even though I'm not a teenager anymore. The first few seasons while Sabrina is in high school are definately the best; the later seasons while she's in college kinda fall apart as various cast memebers drop out of the picture.

The greatest thing about the early seasons of the show: what happens to Sabrina/her friends are exactly the things that most teenagers go through--well, with the exception of being witches--but it's really easy to connect with the issues such as feeling like an outsider, dealing with bullying, etc. The show is packed with humor and life lessons (even though sometimes they're reached in cheesy ways), and it's just a great production overall (except for the fact that robotic Salem looks really awful in the first season :P).

After i watched the entire 7 seasons--I watched it AGAIN! It's like that song you like so much you put on repeat and I think it's because of the nostalgia of the late 90s and early 00s. I didn't have a cookie cutter childhood but the cast did their job so well sometimes I thought I did have that great childhood. Lol!

I think the last part of season 6 and the first half of season 7 was a waste because--duh! Sabrina have always loved Harvey and  vice versa but I guess they wanted to add 'tense' in the storyline especially after Nate Richert was taken off the cast and they received backlash from fans.

8158130,5,B000KLQUMG,"I'm a fan of this show. This show, in my opinion, is a well written and cast comedy series.

Season One starts on Sabrinas ( Melissa Joan Hart) 16th birthday where she
finds out she is a half witch. Great season full of lots of well written
and cast comedy. It states teen audience
I recommend this series to a ALL ages. I am not a teen, live with one and we both like this series.

Season two starts on Sabrinas 17th birthday and continues to be full of
great story lines throughout the season.
The cooky aunt Hilda, brainy logical aunt Zelda and the fun droll Character
Salem the Cat continue to bring lots of fun and laughs while Sabrina continues
to try to balance a normal teenage life while being a witch.

Sabrina gets herself into jams both as a teen and a witch. Salem tends to hinder her with his form of helping her which is often self serving on his part. Quite entertaining.
Season two brings a few new characters, Valerie (Lindsey Stone)
new classmate, a Quiz Master(Alimi Ballard) is thrown in the mix to teach Sabrina more about her magical side and test her on
her witch knowledge.
There are many guest stars and cameos throughout season one and again in season two.
(Youll have to watch to see the who shows up in the second season. ;-) )

Very cleaver writing, well cast, hilarious show.

If you haven't seen it, give it a chance you might just find yourself like me,
laughing out load.

I like the show overall, I find the antics of Salem the Cat to be some of my favorite sub story lines. I enjoy the droll humor, this show is full of droll humor and funny story lines.
As I wrote in my review of season one, I will buy all the seasons as they come out of this television series.

I have rated this second season 5 Stars because I really like
this show. However, the second season has been edited which is disappointing
These cuts I assume have royalties involved.

I would love to see this series have some behind the scenes out takes,as well as actor and/or writer commentary in the DVD's... That is lacking in the two seasons so far, hope the future seasons will have some 'special features' added.",1518825600,,2122,4.368020304568528
