2480595,5,B000E1NWH8,"Whisky is a mystery - especially for those not familiar with South American culture.  Most will miss the mystery, much less see the very subtle clues.  At the top level this movie is about the contrast of romantic love versus something much more enduring; sacrificial love.  For those not familiar with machismo approach to love in South America its weakness is selfishness which makes men unreliable; many wives stash away money and jewels for when they will be deserted by their husbands.  This is why older brother is so unusual - he is extremely faithful.  His younger, flashier brother is all fun but no follow through whose personal life is a shambles.  So I'll point out some of the clues you may miss.

Marta character is based on the Biblical Martha who served - service is her love language, not physical touch.
- Her ""God willing"" affirms she's just like the Biblical Martha; a good Catholic
- She's uncomfortable touching during the photographing (the Whisky scene, it's the title of the movie for a reason).
- She flinches when the younger brother kisses her cheek (very unusual, this is a common greeting).
- She is a faithful (always early) employee very attentive to the needs of her boss.  She takes care of all the details and anticipates his needs.
- She is very surprised when her boss does something for her - because he's speaking her love language.

The younger brother is only successful in business and is a mess otherwise.
- He talks about his ""little girls"" who are grown up and off to college, he's very likely divorced.
- He states he travels a lot and never sees his family
- He did NOTHING for his dying mother
- He uses money to try and pay back his brother for his failing to help

The young newlyweds are provided to show the contrast between romantic love and sacrificial love.
- Their affection is all physical
- The wife complains he never listens to her, he responds he will today, but he already hasn't in his gambling
- The wife is the initiator, the man responds or not as he pleases

The older brother is a man of deep commitment and judgment
- He stood by his mother until the end, his whole apartment was given over to meeting her needs, to Marta it wasn't a mess, it was a billboard shouting his deep love of his mother in a language she understands.
- He is passionately committed, look at how he supports his soccer team in spite of their poor performance and shrugs off the ridicule of his acquaintances
- All of his business dealings are relational and based on personal trust
- His failing car is either a sign of his being an inept businessman or the personal price he pays to meet his commitments
- He cares for his employees as people; when he says no to turning on the radio he sees the hurt feelings and offers a compromise (very un-macho)
- He listens to everything Marta says and acts on it (compare to the young couple).

The Story arc is one of Marta becoming loved - but the language is service, not romance.
- Compare her first visit to the apartment (she follows) to her last visit (he's holding doors for her)
- He asks her for help while working on the blinds (lets her serve, same as accepting her affection)
- In the hotel she says she can't sleep without water by the bed.  He fills her glass first even though she's asleep (self-less act of service)
- She gets the bed, he takes the couch
- He repays her for the valet tip (she's always taken care of the details for him)
- He is very frugal - so is Marta (wouldn't tip for soap in the rest room), she likes this about him
- He won't let her ride a bus, but get's her a taxi, when a frugal man spends money on you it sends a message
- He gives her a small fortune - see my comment about hoarding wives above
- He's confident Marta will be back to work (no, she didn't run off with the money)

There's more, but I'll leave the rest to the viewer to discover.",1405123200,18,3875,4.356449375866852
2480596,5,B000E1NWH8,"Esta pelcula es una verdadera joya del arte cinematogrfico del Uruguay, la he visto ya tres veces y no me canso de verla.
Tiene un drama muy bonito y con mucho realismo de la realidad del pueblo uruguayo.

2480597,4,B000E1NWH8,"First thing to note is that Whisky is NOT a comedy, and if you must categorize, it is a low-key drama.  So often, box covers do get mislabeled.

Whisky takes place in Uraguay, where the main characters, a sock factory owner whose business and shop seem to bear the brunt of the economy.  Three employees occupy the rundown factory, and one is Marta, a dutiful matronly woman who almost runs the place throught default.  She knows and understands her boss, Jacobo; they speak very little to one another, but they perform their duties in a perfunctorily manner.  Everyday, they do the same things in the shop and their personal life appears to also be a lonely existence.

Jacobo's more successful brother arrives for the unveiling of their mother's headstone and Jacobo propositions Marta to come to the home for a few days.  He doesn't explain why, but Marta understands, and she is to pretend to be his wife.  She moves in, makes the necessary changes as she anticipates her role.  Jacobo and his brother have a strained relationship also, so Marta also fills in the communication void.  Upon arrival they take a vacation to a resort that also shows effects of the economy.  Here, Marta becomes a person of interest, she comes out of her shell, if anything, just a little.  She reveals herself away from her usual lonely, repetitious existence.

This is an excellent film, a little quirky and poignant.  Some viewers will not feel the same;  it is minimal at best.  Not much happens, it is about two brothers who must connect, but their feeling remains distant.  It is all about the mood, the feelings, the atmosphere.  Every scene tells us a great deal.  There isn't a need to speak; we, the viewer can feel it. The entire storyline is unique!

The DVD includes is a short interview with the directors, but not much is divulged.  Also, included is a computer link to a discussion about the film, although I could not get it to operate.  Acting and casting are brilliant.  The film leaves one with plenty of questions that have not been answered and provides excellent discussion afterwards.  Whisky is an award winner at the Cannes Film Festival 2004....Rizzo",1264032000,7,2161,4.747311827956989
2480598,4,B000E1NWH8,"This droll, deadpan comedy from Uruguay, clearly influenced by directors such as Jarmusch and Kaurismaki, is a real find. Directors Rebella (who killed himself shortly after this film was released) and Stoll, tells the story of two middle aged Jewish brothers. The elder brother has remained in Uruguay, running a decrepit sock factory, and acts taciturn and resentful, feeling life has cheated on him. The younger, more easy going brother, has moved to Brazil, where he has raised a family and runs a succesful textile factory in the Sao Paulo area. When their mother dies, the brother in Brazil returns to Uruguay for the funeral. So that his younger brother will not pity him, his older brethren asks a middle aged, somewhat plump employee to pretend to be his wife when his brother returns (this plot point is not really very believable, but in the cinema you sort of accept it). There is little else plotwise to the movie, as the brothers and the fake wife tour some of the deserted, sunless beaches of Uruguay to kill time and to get acquainted (or reacquainted) with each other as well as to settle past scores. To those that thing South America is everywhere a tropical and exotic place, they might be surprised to see a movie that is somewhat reminiscent of the old Eastern Bloc movies (Uruguay is well to the south of the tropics, its climate is temperate, and is the least typically south american of spanish speaking nations in the continent). In a way, this movie might be also be a metaphor of Uruguay, once a country that was called the Switzerland of South America for its democracy and progressivism, but that in the last few decades has seen a nasty military dictatorship, and some of its infrastructure and social capital run down. Worth seeing and quite moving.",1217980800,10,1781,4.766990291262136
2480599,5,B000E1NWH8,"This subtle Uruguayan gem gives new meaning to the term ""deadpan comedy"", but its nuanced humor, mixed with some very real human drama, makes a refreshing antidote to all the obvious, strained comedies which constantly inundate us. All three lead performances are blisteringly honest: the trio play off each other like seasoned Philharmonic musicians. A poignant, understated slice of life from directors Rebella and Stoll.",1185753600,7,423,5.523076923076923
2480600,5,B000E1NWH8,"Juan Pablo Rebella, the director of this movie, committed suicide on July 5th 2006, a couple of months after the big hit in Cannes. It seems to me, this movie was really his opera prima and terminal film at the same time. Extraordinary lethargic piece of art. Honest and simple, the two hardest thing to do in filmmaking. I only wish we could have enjoyed more of his work and talent. Descansa en Paz amigo Rebella.",1154995200,11,415,4.473684210526316
2480601,5,B000E1NWH8,"A quietly powerful and touching film.  Aside from giving North American viewers a rare and fascinating glimpse of a country (Uruguay) that has for so long languished in the shadow of bigger neighbors Argentina and Brazil, Whisky delivers an antidote to the photogenic violence and exoticized romance that in recent decades have tended to dominate both international distribution of Latin American cinema and (perhaps as a consequence) the North's perception of the region. At the same time, this impeccably acted and directed film offers a timely but low-key critique of the effects of the global economy on the kind of marginally poor--but not destitute or violent--people that comprise the majority of Latin America's inhabitants.  The film does so without caving in to the demands of the market, which explains its slow pace and also its failure get nominated for an Oscar--a nomination it most certainly deserved.",1146960000,22,917,5.273972602739726

2480646,5,B000E1NWH8,"The slowest film I have ever watched.
That might be a terrible thing for some, or a great thing for others.
The story is extremely simple but the characterization and superb acting provides us with the complexity that leads us to such a wonderful  and unique experience.
The acting is superb due to its subtlety, it's not dramatic in any way, all the opposite. The characters are aloof, sad, thoughtful, shy and seem to have reach a point in their life where they have conformed.

This is a slow movie! very very slow.....not much drama, not even laughs. That's the magic! I have never seen a movie where characters play
INDIFFERENCE to the maximum. Very sad movie too.... their indifference leads us to the drama that actually exists, a life full of wants, hopes
and desires - all contained.
The actress won several acting awards, not surprised.

8104033,3,B000E1NWH8,"The acting is really first-rate.  It's the story that becomes labored and burdensome. At first,  I was fascinated and amused by the totally deadpan expressions and the anhedonia maintained by 2 of the 3 protagonists, especially how the leads were able to pull that off.  As the story goes, Jacobo (Andres Pazos), a 60ish owner of a down-at-the-heels sock factory, is about to receive a visit from his estranged successful brother Herman (Jorge Bolani). Wanting to appear more together, he asks his assistant Marta (Mirella Pascual) to play his wife. How she transforms his environment is quite clever, even posing for a photo representing a happy seasoned married pair. The atmospheric setting reflecting the dilapidated sock factory with its outdated machines, sock forms, broken shades, is well executed; as is the before-and-after staging of Jacobo's apartment by Marta. Then, in spite of my giving it all my attention, expectancy, and sheer sitting power, I notice I'm watching essentially the quotidian routine of 3 folks : 1 chronically majorly depressed and antipatico, who has 1 moment of wild impulsivity; another seemingly mostly depressed by association, a sort of partner in a folie a deux, who later shows that she does have some capacity for pleasure, in the company of Herman;  he, the third, a rather jolly pleasing guy, who gives good karaoke. The pace is particularly slow; the bits of fine satirical humor seem to recede. One wants to muster compassion for Jacobo, but he appears so cold and unkind to the others. And one might say this is a subtle, nuanced study of these characters, but the flaw is that the film, early on, converts from interesting and attention-holding to boring. The theme is a good one: people's loneliness, difficulty connecting, denial of pleasure. The repetitiveness  and sameness of their daily lives do support their state of mind , but that is made clear from the start. Writers/Directors Rebella and Stoll are precise and astute in their representation of such lives. Maybe it's an impossible task to portray that dullness without the story's suffering the same fate.  I stayed till the end, but it was brutal.",1478822400,,2159,5.050561797752809

8104038,1,B000E1NWH8,"I'm American, let me say first off. But I'm not writing this as an American who expected a blockbuster and is therefore disappointed. I watch movies from all over the world, and I teach a class on Latin American culture. I show movies from each country; I've had a hard time finding something from Uruguay.

I can't say anything good about this bore fest. The movie is quite seriously an hour and 34 minutes of people standing and staring at each other, making coffee, smoking, standing in doorways, and repeating the same actions over and over again. I'm thinking maybe the humor is supposed to be in the repetitive ""groundhog day"" humdrum routines, but there are no laughs here. From the first minute of the movie, in which the protagonist is sitting in his car trying to start the engine, after which he drives to work as the credits roll (5 agonizing minutes) I had the feeling this would be a snoozer.

The comic premise revolves around a boss asking his employee to come to his house and stand in as his wife to fool his visiting brother. This happens, but without any measurable comedy. The conversations are often as mundane as ""Can I turn the radio on?"" (long pause) ""Yeah sure"" (I'm paraphrasing of course, but not exaggerating).

I'm absolutely fine with slice-of-life movies. I actually really liked the Uruguayan dramedy ""Tanta agua"", which is in that genre as well, but which is charged with more energy, better acting, better film quality, and a better overall paradigm. I know that a country like Uruguay doesn't have as much of a financial pool to draw from as the US or Europe; the fact is though, that if this is Uruguayan comedy, I really don't get it. The positive reviews tout this movie as ""dry,"" but I think there's a fine line between dry humor and simply missing any humor at all.

Look, I know comedy is extremely subjective; what the Brits laugh at makes me fall asleep, and vice versa (I know from experience). My idea of dry comedy is more like Bill Murray's work or The humor in ""MASH."" I'm sorry, this movie just didn't hold my attention at all. I watched it in fast forward and missed nothing.",1464825600,3,2126,4.586842105263158
