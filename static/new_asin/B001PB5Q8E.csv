3746724,5,B001PB5Q8E,"The first time I remember reading about this remarkable man was in a book called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Priest-Forever-Nine-Signs-of-Renewal-and-Hope/dp/0867169540/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Priest Forever: Nine Signs of Renewal and Hope</a>&nbsp;by Alfred McBride, O. PREAM. I still find it astonishing how this priest lived a life of such profound faith, real hope, and genuine joy in the midst of tremendous suffering. A brother in Christ I had loaned the book to was equally inspired by the mention of this man's dedication to the Eucharist and Christ, so he got a copy of the DVD entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Road-of-Hope-The-Spiritual-Journey-of-Cardinal-Nguyen-Van-Thuan/dp/B001PB5Q8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Road of Hope: The Spiritual Journey of Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan</a>.

  My husband and I watched the documentary last evening and are still letting the magnitude of grace, perseverance, holiness, joy, and hope Cardinal Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan exuded settle in. I can't even imagine what it must have been like for him to be locked in a prison camp in Vietnam for thirteen years, nine of which he spent in solitary confinement.

For days, weeks, sometimes months, he lived in complete darkness. The only personal possession he had when taken to the prison was a Rosary. He had prayed that if there was no more work that he could do for the Church that the Lord make his sacrifice complete by taking his life while he was in prison, but that if there was more work he could do to glorify God through serving the Church then he wanted to live long enough to do whatever that would be. At one point his tuberculosis had gotten so bad, they were going to do surgery to remove the largely infected area in one of his lungs. He was on the table prepped for surgery, when everything was stopped so another x-ray could be taken. This x-ray showed that his lungs were both perfectly fine. Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan attributed his miraculous healing to the intercession of the Blessed Mother.

  God had much more to do in and through this man to bring others closer to Him, to shepherd Christ's flock, and be an inspiration to Catholics all over the world. His life journey is well-documented. The DVD includes interviews with Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan, his sister, footage of his parents, clips of him when he worked at the Vatican, and it chronicles some of the most challenging periods of suffering in his life.

  He modeled the true love and forgiveness of Christ, thereby converting many. I wouldn't recommend showing such graphic images of suffering and poverty to children, however, teens and adults will definitely be given a clear picture of what it means to say yes to God no matter what. I don't see how you could fail to be spellbound by this man's unfailing commitment to living joyfully and hopefully for God in the face of unimaginable suffering.",1322092800,8,2991,5.317796610169491

3746726,5,B001PB5Q8E,"The story of Cardinal Francis Van Thuan was given to a men's group at church.  Every man was both shocked and inspired.  It is a story of extreme hardship, hope, joy and incredible forgiveness.  The story makes us realize all the blessings that we have in our own lives.  It will always remind me of those in the world who suffer greatly for their faith and yet ""their message to the world is a smile"".",1307318400,10,402,4.32
3746727,5,B001PB5Q8E,"This is a documentary of the life of Cardinal Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan.

3746728,5,B001PB5Q8E,"What a story of faith, courage, grace, hope and LOVE! This excellent film documents Cardinal Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan's life...from seminarian & member of a very powerful south-Vietnamese family, to Bishop...to a prisoner of the north-Vietnamese for 13 years...to Cardinal working for Peace & Justice..

I bought the ""Road of Hope"" and ""Testimony of Hope"" books awhile back -- after seeing this documentary, dusted them off & have been deeply touched by the spiritual gems shared within.. Highly recommend these books: bite-sized wisdom from Bishop Van Thuan smuggled out of prison on scraps of paper along with Lenten devotionals written for the Pope.

So many things stand out in the documentary - the devotion of Francis Xavier's mother (who kept him humble - when he became a Bishop - ""you're still just a priest, but of more people!""..)..his steadfast faith in captivity, dedication to his flock...his love, even for cruel captors, telling them he loved them..when asked why, ""because Jesus loves you.""

Highly recommend this DVD documentary...can't wait to watch it again - may Cardinal Van Thuan's faith increase your faith as it has mine!!",1246924800,23,1148,5.194594594594594
3746729,5,B001PB5Q8E,"This is a beautiful documentary on the life of Cardinal Van Thuan which will enrich the spiritual life of every Christian who views it.  It will also provide profound insights into the recent history of Viet Nam as well as the future of Christianity in Asia.  It brings to life the profound spiritual insight of the Cardinal during his long imprisonment by the communist government of Viet Nam:  ""Do I love God or do I love the things of God?""  If it is God that I love, then it does not matter where I am in order to fulfill my vocation as a Christian. Today, when Christians are increasingly called upon to bear witness to the reality of Christ in their lives regardless of the challenges posed by dramatic changes in their culture, the life of Cardinal Van Thuan will provide not only a strong example, but an occasion for self-examination. As the cause for the canonization of Cardinal Van Thuan continues, this documentary should become increasingly important.",1239408000,33,965,4.726190476190476
3746730,5,B001PB5Q8E,I say this because the man in the film Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan appears so gentle and then to read his book is such and experience. Yes I recommend this film.,1399075200,,159,4.161290322580645
3746731,5,B001PB5Q8E,"Cardinal Van Thuan spent 13 years in prison. 9 years he was in solitary confinement. He celebrated Holy Mass with a few drops of wine, a drop of water and a very very little piece of bread on the palm of his hand, his altar and cathedral. This witnes is great. He survived 9 years of solitary confinement. It was possible for him to talk with GOD.
He must be a Saint.

Amazon: make more subtittles for this great movie about the life of cardinal Van Thuan.

3746732,3,B001PB5Q8E,"Somehow I thought this would be a movie compared to a few I have watched,  like 10 questions for the Dalai Lama , Jesus Camp or others I found interesting.  It is worth watching at least once.  Even though I found his life interesting, the movie just didn't grab me.",1383523200,,266,4.28

3746735,5,B001PB5Q8E,"The amazing spiritual journey of Cardinal Nguyen was just incredible. The movie was done more like a documentary, I could really feel what the Cardinal went thru. It was made in a way kids would get closer to, something they would be interested in or attracted to. Even my parish priest liked it so much he hasn't given it back to me yet! It's about a person that really existed,a now a day hero, not hundred's of years ago, but recently, with historical accuracy. Makes the life of St. Max Kolbe, Bl. John Paul II and St. Maria Goretti closer and better heroes for teenagers' to look up to.",1375315200,,591,4.431192660550459
3746736,5,B001PB5Q8E,"the message of the life of Cardinal Van Thuan is very important. He live in our time. Experience communism first hand, yet his faith and love keep him going. He is one of a remarkable man that I ever met in my life. He is a man who live the injustice in his life. But he said LOVE is contagious, with love you can change your enemy to become your friends. Then he become the president of the Pontifical office for Justice and Peace. I believe his cause is on the way to sainthood. Its a very good documentation with interview of with his close friends and family.",1364169600,,563,4.222222222222222

3746739,5,B001PB5Q8E,"I borrowed this DVD from my parish library for my Confirmation report and I'm so thrilled that I picked it up! I cried throughout the whole biography because the life of Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan was filled with so much suffering and despair during his imprisonment of 13 years to the Communists in Vietnam after the fall. I'm sure the gaurds were physically violent but this was not talked about in the interviews. I know Van Thuan's prison mate before Van Thuan's solitary confinement of 9 years. The prison mate told us stories of how the Communist would inflict physical harm to the point of broken ribs.

Yet, Van Thuan remained loving throughout his confinement and befriended many of the gaurds due to his love of all people no matter how cruel he was treated. His faith sustained him and kept him hopeful, allowing him to convert many of the Communist gaurds. Also, he renewed the faith of the war-ravaged Vietnamese people through his spirital reflections that he smuggled out for the surrounding Vietnamese communities. These were compiled together and have been printed and circulated.

I'm too young to understand what my parents went through during the Vietnam war and I'm grateful for this biography. It gives insight to the adversities of my people and Cardinal Van Thuan's legacy of Hope and Love. I am inspired to trust the Lord in my life through this beloved martyr and saint! Cardinal Van Thuan, intercede my cause and pray for me!",1336003200,8,1451,4.823293172690763

8332859,5,B001PB5Q8E,"This is an incredible true documentary about a Holy, Kind,Saintly Cardinal.
In this climate of mediocre church so-called leadership, Cardinal VanThaun is not only an inspiration, he proves that true Love for God MUST demonstrate itself in Love for our Enemy.  If each of us who says we are a Christian actually asked God to help us LOVE OUR ENEMY, DO GOOD TO THOSE WHO PERSECUTE YOU, what would happen in this world?  I love this movie.",1454457600,,436,4.64935064935065
