3918635,5,B002EOVXEW,this was my favorite show.  my son found dark shadows on-line and ordered 2 for Christmas.  i have been buying them since.  the original is the best. i don't think it could be better if made today.  in the 60's movie makers still had to use their imagination more so if there was a limited budget. errors and all are still fun to watch. i will treasure this always.,1334361600,,365,4.246376811594203

3918638,3,B002EOVXEW,"I remember watching ""Dark Shadows"" as a kid and racing home every day after school at 4:00 pm. The storylines of vampires, witches, ghosts, time travel and secret rooms that cursed the Collins family were always captivating - you couldn't wait to see what happened next.

I always wanted to see the straight storyline of one character without the commercials, secondary storylines and daily introductions. The Barnabas DVD release does an excellent job of editing his curse storyline down to nearly three hours in one nearly, clean movie. Remember, by 1968 standards, this was state of the art and by today's standards, it's far less than perfect. It still has all the charms of missed dialogue, confused actors, cameramen shooting the wrong scene, grips walking around in the background, etc.

""The Haunting of Collinwood"" DVD has the same charms. Unfortunately, the story build up is much slower and less interesting. If you have to choose between the two, the Barnabas storyline is far more engaging. And for the die hard fan, get them both to fill out your collection.",1280102400,14,1072,4.983240223463687

And this was just one storyline in a 5 year series that the drama and excitement never fails.  If you are new to the Dark Shadows world or wanting to relive what you enjoyed about it in your youth, this is the DVD to get!",1265846400,4,393,3.8875
3918640,4,B002EOVXEW,"Inspired by Henry James's classic ""The Turn of the Screw,"" the ""Ghost of Quentin Collins"" plot has always been my all-time favorite ""Dark Shadows"" storyline. And this DVD, ""The Haunting of Collinwood,"" is a very good distillation of that plot -- which originally ran for about ten weeks (about 50 episodes) on the original series -- to a single disc. It's not perfect, mind you. I regret that they didn't start with David and Amy first hearing Quentin's voice (which the viewer doesn't hear at the time, making it especially creepy) on the old disconnected telephone, which got the whole ball of possession rolling. And I miss the sequence where the writing appears on the mirror. But the DVD makes up for it with what it does have. The sequence with the psychic Janet Finley is especially good, as are the segments where Elizabeth Stoddard finally realizes the children are indeed possessed. and when Prof. Stokes discovers -- nearly at the cost of his life -- that his attempted exorcism of the house has failed. The bonus episode, revealing how Quentin died and why he's haunting the house (which, as it turns out, was negated when Barnabas Collins went back in time and managed to change history), is the perfect complement.

Overall, this DVD is well worth owning if you don't already have the original episodes themselves and either want to ""relive"" the story or experience it for the first time. The ""companion disc"" -- ""The Vampire Curse,"" revealing the story of how Barnabas became a creature of the night -- is excellent, too. But if I had to choose between them, this one, ""The Haunting of Collinwood,"" is the one I'd get.",1256860800,29,1633,4.770318021201414

3918642,5,B002EOVXEW,"This disc, along with the other new DS DVD, are definately a must have if you are a casual fan of the show. For those of us with the complete collection already on DVD, there is nothing really new of interest. There is a nice NEW interview of David Selby, but it only runs a few minutes and leaves you wondering what happened to the rest of the interview. Just when you are getting into the interview, it chops off and ends. I guess they will be using the rest of it for some other re-issue down the road. There is also a funny 20 second PBS spot by Selby. Also included a a complete episode from the show.  I would have left that off and included more of the interview, at least this way there could have been more new content on the disc. For the common fan who has not purchased all 20+ box sets, this is a good disc to get, but for those of us who regularly watch the episodes already on DVD, this disc will probably sit on a shelf collecting dust after the first viewing.",1253232000,35,976,4.109947643979058
3918643,5,B002EOVXEW,"It has been almost 40 years since Dark Shadows has been off the air,But for us that loved it and grew up with it,the
show has never left us for one day,the sole company that has kept Dark Shadows alive MPI deserves more than just a pat on the back they deserve everything good that can happen to a Company like theres. It is because of MPI and there continuing Affection for this show like we have that they continue to release new material,and even though some of the material has been seen before they make it brand new by placing it in new dvd,s featuring plot lines from the show that maybe we had some how missed. I hope that MGM is smart enough to let MPI do the distribution and production onto DVD and Blu Ray discs of the release Of House Of Dark Shadows. I hope in any case who ever gets the rights to place House Of Dark Shadows on DVD they do the right thing and get all the actors who are still alive who were in Dark Shadows and let them all do Commentaries and other special pieces on the dvd,s. We have lost so many great actors like Joan Bennett and Louis Edmonds that we can never hear the great stories any more that they had on Dark Shadows and How and what was going on while the filming was happening. Again though Thankyou MPI you are a class act in a world of distributors who don't care about our history of TV and Film you certainly do. Thanks for keeping Dark Shadows and its memories alive.

3918644,5,B002EOVXEW,"Decades before Twilight there was Dark Shadows, the first-ever gothic soap opera, its supernatural stories captivating audiences young and old almost 45 years.

With its alluring tales of Gothic mystery and supernatural intrigue, Dark Shadows became one of the most popular daytime series of all time. Since first airing on ABC-TV from 1966-71, Dark Shadows has justifiably earned the reputation of being one of the most unusual and enduring TV programs in history.

Thanks to MPI Home Video, that iconic Classic returns with two special DVDs compiling episode scenes from two of its most popular story arcs, one featuring the character Barnabas Collins, the vampire, the second disc featuring Quentin Collins, the werewolf.

Each disc, sold separately, contains about three hours of content, which includes selected scenes from color episodes as well as a new interview with the actor whose character is spotlighted.

Dark Shadows: The Haunting of Collinwood, is devoted to the original beloved werewolf - Quentin Collins.

Dark Shadows debuted in June 1966, but faced cancellation because of poor ratings within a year. Creator Dan Curtis, desperate to save the show, decided to ""go"" supernatural, so he launched various spook-filled stories that led to the introduction of vampire Barnabas Collins, portrayed by Jonathan Frid. The storyline saved the show, but several years later, the ratings dipped again. So, Curtis released another phenomenon from the genie bottle: the werewolf, Quentin Collins.

The introduction of Quentin, portrayed unforgettably by David Selby, was a high mark for the show and rejuvinated its fan base. The story involving Quentin had all of the elements that made Dark Shadows a true classic - the only soap opera in history to have had ALL of its episodes released on DVD. Like Frid two years earlier, Selby became incredibly popular, an instant idol and sex symbol among teenaged girls.

In this special disc, the origin of Quentin is told. Selby was also interviewed specially for this compilation release.

Quentin's tale had the core cast of the series portraying their own relatives, and other characters in the Collinwood of 1897, after Barnabas Collins had traveled back in time using secrets from the mystical Chinese practice of the I Ching, or Book of Changes.

Barnabas had made the supernatural voyage back in time to save young David Collins and his friend, Amy Jennings, who had both become possessed in modern-day (1970's) Collinwood. The children were being menaced by a horrifying and utterly silent ghost - the spectre of Quentin Collins.

Quentin was the victim of a werewolf curse that had been placed on him by a grieving gypsy, Magda Rocozzi (portrayed with memorable gusto in an Emmy-calibre performance by Grayson Hall), who blamed him for the death of her sister, who was also Quentin's wife.

Complicating the plot was the arrival of the sinister Count Andres Petoffi (also protrayed with brilliance by core cast member Thayer David), who possessed supernatural powers and was being hunted by the gypsies. Barnabas believed that the cure to Quentin's ""affliction"" rested with Petofi. If Quentin could be cured, then the children facing death in Collinwood's present day would be saved!

The core brilliance of has made Dark Shadows endure are the eternal themes it illustrated: Love, death, fear, longing, revenge, obsession, lies, secrets, loyalty and betrayal all played out against a compelling backdrop of Gothic sensibilities that included vampires, werewolves, zombies, seances, time travel, ghosts, mystery, murder, intrigue and a constant dose of the unexpected.

This ""soap opera"" managed to transcend its genre by bringing a taste of Gothic horror and science-fiction fantasy to the hum-drum world of the afternoon drama. There had never been anything like it before - and there never has been since!

In addition to Selby, Frid, Hall and David, primary co-stars on the disc are: Joan Bennett, Louis Edmonds, Nancy Barrett, Lara Parker, David Henesy, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Terry Crawford, Virgina Vestoff, Don Brisco, Marie Wallace, Donna McKechnie, Clarice Blackburn, John Karlen, Michael Stroka, Paula Laurence, Diana Millay and Jerry Lacy.

3918657,2,B002EOVXEW,"This deals with the part of the storyline where the kids are being influenced and later controlled by Quentin. I was hoping for more focus on Quentin instead of the kids, which is the opposite of what I got. The entire plot is much longer than what this edited version brings to the table. It skips the beginning where David makes the initial contact. I was never really a fan of this plot and was hoping it would extend a bit more to the past, as the DS: Vampire Curse DVD did but it doesn't, other than a bonus episode which shows how Quentin became the ghost. All in all, it's not really what I cared for and if I had the chance to preview it before buying, I'd have skipped it. I wish they had done more of these types of DVDs. There's some much better storylines that could have been addressed. This isn't something I plan on ever sitting through again.

3918684,4,B002EOVXEW,"As I stated a few minutes ago on the companion to this disc (Vampire Curse) I originally had not intended to buy these discs when new 2009, I had just spent approx early 4 figures for the full series over 6 years.  Go no that in 2012, the 32 sets of 4 discs and 3 standalones I bought would now be offered in a mega set for way way less.  But one can not predict the future.  And I admit I do like summaries to a point, so when the chance came at the 2014 festival to buy these 2 now 5 year old discs for less than the original list price of 1 (5 bucks a pop) I figured why not, I can always find a friend not ready for the full series to give them away to if they still don't hold my interest, but so far they do.  This disc unlike its companion, only takes place in the present, it is a summary of David and his playmate Amy Jennings discovering  one of the many locked off rooms of his ancestral home and finding the ghost of his great great uncle Quentin who lived in the 1890s and his housemaid Beth Chavez.  The summary here is how the ghosts end up possessing the kiddies and eventually scaring everyone out of the Great House and take refuge with ""Cousin Barnabas"" at the old house (fortunately he is under his present day cure, so he won't go vampire on them).  As extras, the disc includes an interview with David Selby not in the episode sets and an episode from the 1897 timeframe of episodes but from the present, as Julia Hoffman learns from Beth's ghost how Quentin died before (unknown to Beth's ghost) history was changed by Barnabas' arrival.  As I mentioned in my review of the other disc, it is nice if you like summaries.  If you need the whole story, buy the series.  For now I will keep this and its bosom buddy with all my Dark Shadows stuff.  It might come in handy to introduce a new friend to this great series.",1415404800,,1838,4.134831460674158

It used to be a radio series and then a TV series.  This movie is not very understandable.,1367539200,,258,3.811320754716981

3918721,5,B002EOVXEW,"For the casual fan or for anyone remotely interested in the 1960's daytime soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" this neat little forgotten DVD set is a must-have. If you cannot afford the remarkable ""Complete Series Box Set"" this is really a good place to start in getting to know what made ""Dark Shadows"" one of the most popular daytime serials of all-time.

 The plot (shown in scenes, not episodes) deals with a new character named Quentin Collins (played superbly by ""Falcon Crest's"" David Selby). Quentin has possessed the children of Collinwood, David and Amy, and when David shows signs that he may die as he is in acoma his cousin Barnabas Collins goes back to the year 1897 to see if he can figure out the origin of Quentin and perhaps save little David's life.

 While in 1897 Barnabas meets the Collin's family, Quentin, Judith, Edward, Carl and others (all of whom are played by the shows actors in different roles) and he also meets the campy and funny Magda, possibly the best role Grayson Hall ever had in her career.

 The story if full of surprises, jolts, neat production values and actually ran from April 1st, 1969 until the end of November of that year and is highly regarded as being the best story ""Dark Shadows"" ever had. The serial zoomed to the top of the daytime Nielsen's attracting a remarkable 20,000,000 viewers daily.

 Other characters that I love in this story arc are the return of Laura Collins, Angelique and the nutty Jenny Collins played wonderfully by Marie Wallace.",1358985600,2,1495,4.723076923076923

3918723,3,B002EOVXEW,"Compared to the original series it was boring. I'm a huge fan of the cult classic. I would run home daily to get my Dark Shadows fix, but this didn't do it for me.",1357516800,,163,3.823529411764706

3918726,5,B002EOVXEW,"Dark Shadows: The Haunting of Collinwood tells the story of how the ghost of Quentin Collins haunted the eerie estate of Collinwood.

I must admit, I really liked this DVD. The ""Ghost of Quintin Collins"" storyline from the show was pretty good. It's not perfect, mind you, but it's darn near close. For those casual fans out there who can't swing the entire Dark Shadows DVD Collection, this is a perfect grab for you to see why Dark Shadows was one of the most beloved soap-opera shows on daytime television. Trust me, after you view this, you'll want to save for the collection as I have.

Dark Shadows was aired, originally, on ABC Television from from June 27, 1966, to April 2, 1971. The show was created by Dan Curtis and starred Nancy Barrett, Joan Bennet, Jonathan Frid, Kathleen Cody, Alexandra Moltke, Thayer David, Roger Davis, Louis Edmonds, David Ford, Grayson Hall, Kate Jackson, David Henesy, John Karlen, David Selby, Marie Wallace among others. It ran for a total of 1,225 episodes during its' run. The series became hugely popular when vampire Barnabas Collins appeared a year into its run on TV. Dark Shadows also featured werewolves, zombies, man-made monsters, witches, warlocks, time travel, and a parallel universe. To this very day, it still enjoys a cult following(even amongst the youth of today, believe it or not). There's been a couple of revival takes(one being a pilot) on the series as well as a feature film but it is the original that fans love most dearly.

To be honest, when I was little and the show was being shown on TV, I would watch episodes of the show. It was until recently that I actually got into looking this show up and checking it out. This DVD is a great place to start. I loved it, you will too!",1346025600,3,1747,4.647249190938512
3918727,5,B002EOVXEW,"Very good video, brought back many memories of watching Clinton Collins in the original episodes in the 1960's. I think this is how the series ended with Collinwood abandoned because of the ghost's haunting.",1342828800,,207,5.117647058823529
3918728,5,B002EOVXEW,It was a great series in it's time. Great actors and a plot that kept you on the edge of your seat. The DVD is in black and white. Had no problems watching this DVD. Bring back the old shows with the old actors.,1342051200,,211,3.8181818181818183
3918729,5,B002EOVXEW,"Watching this video took me flying back to my teen years, power-walking home after school to catch the show. As I remembered, the lighting and music perfectly set the tone for the children's creepy discovery of a skeleton inside a sealed wing of the mansion. David Selby is spookily malevolent as the vengeful Quentin. Everyone else plays their parts well. As a live show, the stuttered lines and dead air give the show a feeling of attending a theater production. The story's obvious parallel to Henry James' classic ""Turn of the Screw"" does not distract the viewer from the tale. And if you are like me, even though Quentin speaks no lines but communicates through non-verbal nods and grimmaces, it's still a delight to watch him. For seasoned fans of the show it's a trip down memory lane. For new viewers, you'll step back in time twice: Once to the world of Collinwood, and once to the late 1960's. Both journeys are an adventure worth taking.",1340236800,3,948,4.716867469879518

I have a soft spot for the old series and have watched it from time to time.

This does what I've always wanted. Boil it down to a manageable length so I can complete the story arc.",1512691200,,215,4.219512195121951

8367934,5,B002EOVXEW,"Having grown up watching DS after school, this was a fun walk down memory lane. Even more fun to try to catch the mistakes - fumbles in dialog, a crew member running past the camera at about 2:34, then a mike in the upper right corner at about 2:55. Things I missed as a kid. Yeah, it was kind of hard to follow sometimes because they cut from one episode to a totally different one for the sake of the story, but you get the jist of what's happening. It will be fun to look up the episodes on Hulu and see the entire story line. A good way to kill time on a boring afternoon. Altogether another reason I think TV was so much better in its infancy than it is now - they didn't try to make any political points, push any agenda, or try to make you think a certain way. They just made good, fun TV shows for entertainments sake alone. Thank you Amazon for bringing this back to life.",1506124800,4,881,4.068965517241379

8367936,2,B002EOVXEW,Choppy. Leaves out a lot of the story and feels disjointed when you watch it.  Smashing a bunch of clips of episodes together to try to form a narrative is just not a good ideal in this case. Glad it was on Prime and I didn't have to pay for it.,1502236800,2,245,3.803921568627451
8367937,5,B002EOVXEW,"I was a fan of Dark Shadows and it's been a very long time since I've seen it. A movie shot in late 60's did run longer than movies of today. I never picked up on the goofs the camera and production crews made then, but now I see them.. I gave it a 5 star rating as some are good actors and it is pretty much a classic",1501200000,,318,3.6231884057971016
