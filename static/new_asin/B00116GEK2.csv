3061451,5,B00116GEK2,We love the whole series of Tom Selleck's Jessie Stone movies. They are very unique stories. Tom's character is very intriguing and like-able. The Cinematography is really stunning. Buy them all you will love them.,1204848000,4,214,5.142857142857143
3061452,4,B00116GEK2,"""Jesse Stone: Sea Change"", the fourth TV adaptation of Robert B. Parker's novels of the alcoholic police chief of a tiny coastal town, again offers a terrific little character study/mystery, benefiting enormously from Tom Selleck's grizzled charm and integrity in the lead.

Things are slow in Paradise, and with Stone's ex asking him to quit calling (as she is ""seeing someone""), he finds himself sliding back to the bottle, alarming his friends and the City Council. Deciding to reopen an unsolved murder case from a dozen years earlier, to pass the time, his experience as an ex-L.A. cop soon offers clues that the case was mismanaged, and was far more than a simple bank hostage shooting. Then a father drags his pretty daughter in, claiming she had been raped by a contestant in the upcoming regatta, a charge that Stone is suspicious of, as the girl's behavior indicates a far different scenario. The two cases form the crux of a very interesting few days in Stone's life!

As always, the story is character-driven, with 'regulars' William Devane, Stephen McHattie, Kohl Sudduth, Vito Rezza, and Viola Davis joined by the always enjoyable Kathy Baker, assuming Davis' police job as she has a baby. With Saul Rubinek reprising his role as the money-laundering banker who hired Stone to be chief, the world-weary cop must also deal with a 'bad girl' (Sean Young, who STILL looks hot in a bikini), a 'good girl' with a secret (Rebecca Pidgeon), a crusty ex-bank guard (James Gammon), and an arrogant mobster (William Sadler), and his 'hitman' (James Rogers). And we mustn't forget Joe the Dog as Reggie, mute but reproving witness of Stone's nightly alcoholic 'fix'.

For audiences weaned on action-oriented 'Shoot-'em-Ups', the story may seem slow, but if you prefer your stories deeper than bullet counts, with well-etched characters, and Selleck's undeniable charm, the latest ""Stone"" film will be 100 minutes, well-spent!",1204848000,32,1928,5.075709779179811
3061453,1,B00116GEK2,"A Poor Movie !.  The Last Three Movies based on Robt Parkers ""Jesse Stone"" Books were Great!.  But ""Sea Change"" was a Big Dissapointment!.
The Acting, Plot, and Ending was Terrible.  The only Star that Really Stood Out was The "" Golden Retriver"".  He gave a Performance that was Oscar Quality!.

3061454,5,B00116GEK2,"Selleck has some things going against him to play Jesse Stone. Stone is a ex-shortstop, Selleck is way too big. Stone is in his late 30s and Selleck is much older. However, Selleck nails the character. Selleck plays a character who has no hope, but almost can't himself trying to do his duty and help people. Selleck nails the charm and despair Jesse has in the books just right. The rest of the acting is strong. The plot varies quite a bit from the book, but that is fine. The plot works. His psychiatrist tells him to find something important to do so Jesse decides to solve a cold case in his files. As soon as he gets started on the case, a questionable rape case is introduced. The mysteries plod along on their own path. Jesse slowly turns over the clues very skillfully using his LAPD experience and his knowledge of people. The scenery in New England is great.

In summary, these movies are just well done. They work even though there are no car chases or automatic weapons or nudity. The characters and the town are interesting.",1204243200,8,1038,4.492063492063492
3061455,5,B00116GEK2,"Robert B Parker has a hit character on his hands.  ""Sea Change""  is an old time detective story with Tom Selleck returning to his role as Chief Jesse Stone of Paradise Cove.

What does an ex Los Angeles cop do as a bored Chief of police?

If he's not drinking or issuing parking tickets, he's going through the files of the sloppy ex chief who passed away from corruption in the first installment of the series.  This time, he drags out a 15 year old bank robbery that appears to be a simple case.  With usual Paradise Cove proficiency, the files are incomplete and the excavated grave yields just enough evidence to pique his interest.

The pieces are scanty.  Blood stained clothing.  A sharp shooter security guard who claims he did not miss the robber.  A confession from a crooked bank manager who is 'fond of you (Jesse Stone)'.  Jesse finds himself attracted to a young lady seemingly caring for her mother with honest money.  All the pieces fall into place and the solution slams a romance into the ground.

The laid back, soft drinking Jesse deals with the money launderer, the bank robbers, and a perverted racer in town for the anual regatta.

This is a detective show with class.  Selleck portrays the self torturing Stone with high regard for the books the film is based on.  Not just another Magnum, Stone is a small town Philip Marlowe lying in wait for a diversion worthy of his time.

Stay away from American Idol.  Stay away from Survivor.  Stay away from  the Family Channel.  Hook onto Jesse Stone.  Look for this latest installment from Sony Pictures ([...]  Check out his website for news on a NEW book due out February 8!

3061457,5,B00116GEK2,"The latest DVD dramatization of Robert B. Parker's Jesse Stone novels starring Tom Selleck has everything: Action, drama, mystery, humor, romance and pathos. For me, it is the best of the series thus far.

Sea Change challenges mystery and thriller lovers alike but will also delight those viewers who love wonderful, three-dimensional characterizations and first-class film making.

Frankly, each of these made-for-TV productions of the Jesse Stone books have had the look and feel of a movie.

Selleck is perfect as the brilliant Police Chief of a small town in New England, aptly named 'Paradise' in Massachusetts, who fled the big city which had brought him great professional success along with stress and a failed marriage.

He's wounded and lonely, and struggles with alchoholism. Much like Sherlock Holmes who sometimes took cocaine when he didn't have a case to challenge his sharp mental faculities, Stone has to have something 'important' to investigate or his addiction will consume him.

Abruptly desolate in the very quiet town, Stone decides to open a cold case and, in so doing, is able to set his glass down -- at least for a while. The case he selected is a 20-year-old bank robbery and murder.

The ensuing twists and turns of the investigation, and Stone's unorthodox but endearing style, is entertaining, intriguing and memorable.

Selleck is ably assisted by a very talented cast that includes the gifted Kathy Baker who plays Dispatcher/Officer Rose Gammon, the great Kohl Sudduth as Officer Luthor 'Suitcase' Simpson who awakes from a coma with 'special talents,' and Joe the Dog who plays Reggie.

Lets hope the remainder of the Jesse Stone novels get the same wonderful treatment and come to TV and DVD soon!",1197763200,106,1734,5.080985915492958

3061538,5,B00116GEK2,"I've had the opportunity to read all the Jesse Stone novels and watch the subsequent movies on dvd. What I can say that it is a rare thing when an actor (Tom Selleck) & author (Robert Parker) are so in tune with the character they create that one can't see any separation between the page and film. Jesse is a flawed hero, a man with demons but also with virtues constantly in battle with one another. It's only when Jesse is called out of his personal battle that his virtues lift him up and we can see the spirit of this tormented man. His struggles help personalize him because like all of us, he struggles with the knowledge of good and bad. His struggles, set backs, and victories is what makes us root for Jesse every time; and yet with every victory his demons return which reminds us that there are no simple solutions in life. Life us about that struggle. It's no wonder that two actors who have played characters created by Robert Parker have said those characters were their most challenging and favorite of their acting careers (Tom Selleck-Jesse Stone & Robert Urich-Spencer). If you like the flawed hero doing his best to do the right thing and taking the path of most resistance, then you will enjoy any of the Jesse Stone novels and films.

3061543,1,B00116GEK2,"I gave this movie one star because it had very little to do with the book. The opening credits said that the movie was based on Robert B. Parker's novel ""Sea Change"". I had just finished reading the book and whenever I read a book and there is a movie made from that book I really enjoy seeing the book come to life in a movie. Sometimes the movie isn't near as good as the book but most of the time the movie is enjoyable to watch.

The movie itself was not all that bad, At the most 3 stars. But to say the movie was based on the novel ""Sea Change"" was almost a complete lie. I say almost because the movie did mention one person from the book. Briefly. And the boat the ""Lady Jane"".

I like the Jesse Stone movies and look forward to watching more of them. But, if you are looking forward to watching the movie based on the novel you will be very disappointed.",1488153600,,863,4.070588235294117

""Unintended consequenses."" - Jesse Stone

Five IMPROBABLE Stars. ""Sea Change"" is a excellent edition in the binge-worthy, 9-episode Jesse Stone TV-series which is based on the best-selling novels by renowned author Robert B. Parker, starring award-winning actor Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone, the troubled police chief of the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts. It is the follow-on story that extends events which occurred in the preceding Jesse Stone TV-movie, ""Death in Paradise"", especially regarding the circumstance surrounding police officer, ""Suitcase"" Simpson. And there are major additions to the re-curring cast and some changes to others. This detail-laden edition whets the appetite to see what happens to the characters in the next Jesse Stone movie ""Thin Ice"" with different crime cases. It is very good as a stand-alone cop mystery although the new viewer will have to take some things for granted, and it is flat-out marvelous as part of the overall 9-part series. Even better on the second viewing.

Things get very entertaining and twisty as Stone goes to the shrink to solve some recurring personal problems and opens up a cold case at work just for the challenge. Meanwhile, the second storyline threatens to disturb the burgh of Paradise at the wrong time of the tourist season. Co-starring Kathy Baker in her initial episode, Kohl Sudduth, Rebecca Pidgeon, Sean Young (yes, Blade Runner), Mika Boorem, Stephen McHattie, William Sadler, James Gammon, James Preston Rogers, Nigel Bennett, Vito Rezza, and Saul Rubinek, with Viola Davis and William Devane.

3061666,5,B00116GEK2,"All the Jesse Stone cop/mystery videos I've watched to date, 6 of them, have been great. I wasn't really a cop/mystery fan, vids or books, until I watched Tom Selleck and William Devane in this collection. I accidentally found them in my local public library and picked one to fill out my allotted four vid check outs and became an instant convert. Selleck is a fine actor, perfect in his deadpan, serious cop business, glib humor, functioning alcoholic role as Jesse Stone. (Jonny Walker Red Label scotch sales must have gone up as a consequence.) Selleck also directs some of the films. William Devane is also great as a former cop, now retired and a psychiatrist trying to quit smoking - all his life, apparently. He is trying, unsuccessfully, to help Jesse cope with his divorce, the death of his girlfriend and dog - ""Why is this so hard?"". I won't forget Reggie and Steve (Joe, the red Airedale) as his conscience. Robert Parker created the character of Stone in a sub-series of his many books, one of which I am now reading. The vids are generally composites of Parker's Stone stories and there is some redundancy in dialog and storyline, but it isn't really annoying or boring, I only regret I discovered Parker six years after his death in 2010.",1464998400,,1254,4.678733031674208

3061697,4,B00116GEK2,"I am systematically viewing each of the Jesse Stone films and Sea Change is the fifth film I have reviewed.

The makers of this series have established a pattern for how the films are made.  We have a major plot and a minor plot in each story.  In Sea Change the minor plot involves a young girl who accuses a visitor to Paradise of raping her on his yacht.  Right from the beginning Jesse doubts the accuracy of her statements and passes the case off to Kathy Bates, who mans the phones in the small Paradise police office.

Jesse is so bored that he digs up a cold case, a bank robbery and murder that is over ten years old.  This cold case gives us the major plot for this installment of the series and it turns out to be a complicated problem for Jesse to solve, but solve it he does, and in convincing fashion.

Our director, Robert Harmon, is a former camera man who is expert in shooting this film, which always looks great.  Harmon has directed several other of the Jesse Stone films and he understands how this franchise is supposed to work.  Tom Selleck is the star and also the executive producer of the film.  Harmon and Selleck work closely together to give us a predictable pattern both in story-telling and in character development.

Tom Sellecks character Jesse Stone is world weary, always, in these films.  That said, he is able to rouse himself from time to time when action is called for, but that is not often.  Instead Jesse talks frequently with his other police officers and occasionally with his psychiatrist, ably played by William Devane.  Sadly, Jesse also talks in every episode with his divorced wife Jen, who calls him to check up on him and his drinking problem.  For me these predictable conversations Jesse has with his former wife are the weakest part of these films and I groan when she calls again and they begin one of their innocuous conversations.

Jesse drinks too much  that is a continuing feature of these films and he discusses his problem with Devane, but the psychiatrist doesnt seem to be able to make much progress with Jesse.  Even so, their banter back and forth is fun to listen to.

The Jesse Stone series are mysteries based on the Robert Parker books and typically Jesse does a convincing job as a detective.  His skills as a police officer keep me coming back to see how he will solve his next case.

Im giving Sea Change four stars; it was good, but not great, and I am hoping Jesse returns to form in the next film I view in this series.",1459987200,,2495,4.4635761589403975

3061953,5,B00116GEK2,"All of the Jesse Stone ""movies"" are great, in my mind.  Selleck plays a low key character, yet plagued by insecurities in his job and his life.
Although there are few actors in his films, each one has his/her important role.  In a short period of time he finds the criminal and as a Law Man, he is successful.",1426723200,,309,4.220338983050848

3062119,4,B00116GEK2,"What I love about the Jesse Stone novels is that you never know what you're going to get. Of course you know the characters, but some are intense and emotional, while others focus more on the mystery and small town politics. Sea Change was an interesting choice for the fourth film, as it shows a different side of Jesse and was somewhat unique among the other stories. Jesse Stone (Tom Selleck), was an L.A. Homicide Detective, who left to become a small town police chief in Massachusetts, after his life was thrown into chaos. Now that he's been there a while, he's come to realize that not a lot of things happen in a small town, and he's tired of writing parking tickets. Craving something to do, Stone decides to open the towns only unsolved murder. A body found in the woods, 20 years earlier. As he opens the investigation, it brings up the past, a past that the town of Paradise would like to forget. Sea Change plays more like a Cold Case or Criminal Minds episode than a typical Jesse Stone story, but what's unique about it, is that it really gives us a look inside Jesse's life. Tom Selleck was terrific as always, but he gives a particularly special performance in Sea Change. We finally see the man for what he is, driven by justice and living for the people. His job is his life and when there is nothing to do, he falls back into and becomes stuck in his past. Sea Change is also special as it was the novel that introduces us to the character of Rose Gammon, played by Kathy Baker. I haven't seen her in anything since Picket Fences and God did I love that show! It was really thrilling for me to see her again, and playing a character I really came to admire in the novels. Sea Change might not have the action that younger viewers crave in their police dramas, but it is a textbook example of how to solve a case and a unique look into the mind of one of the deepest characters I know. I loved the books and rarely do these types of stories translate well to film, but with a star like Tom Selleck you can't go wrong and I really did enjoy this film as much as I did the novel.",1408838400,,2097,4.271356783919598

3062238,5,B00116GEK2,"These movies are excellent.  Tom is very realistic in his role as a complex character.  He's still in love with his ex wife and has a loss related to it that he can't get over.  So when he's not challenged to solve a murder or something as police chief of a small town, he spends his time drinking Johnny Walker red scotch and talking with his dog.

The story lines of this series of movies is very good and I am constantly looking forward to watching the next in the series.  Overall the characters are good and you get a sense of family between him and his teammates.  It's like Fargo in that sense but better because there's more than one movie!",1400976000,,648,4.270491803278689

I need to see this Jesses Stone series continue. We need to find a fan blog or website to promote this idea. Perhaps a network will see it worthy to do so and let the story telling of Jesse Stone continue. Try out viewing the first Jesse Stone movie Night Passage on Amazon Prime or just rent it from any other video online service you use. I assure you that you will be hooked. For more about the Jesse Stone series viewing order and short overview of each one, check out this link: mommybearmedia dot com.
  By the way, I just bought the movie soundtrack online. Check out the listing on Amazon. But, look at the customer reviews and see instructions how to buy the soundtrack directly from the music creator who is award winning Jeff Beal. The soundtrack is out of production by the record label but, you can get it from Jeff Beal himself. I am really enjoying the music. This is a great example of the power of customer reviews on Amazon to help consumers like me get access to things that are important to them.

Each episode is interesting and Tom solves a crime but one thing in common with all the episodes is Tom Selleck and the City Council don't get along very well.",1392854400,,495,4.061855670103093

My husband and I, who generally have diverging tastes, enjoyed it as did my 21-year-old son.  I particularly enjoy the characters who are allowed to have back stories that don't overwhelm the central story line.  People aren't one dimensional.  The protagonist is full of self absorbed and self pitying. Recurring bad guys aren't simply bad guys -- they have their own lines in the sand or are acting out a character flaw; they are not complete monsters. There's still a problem depicting good looking young women (all of whom throw themselves at Jesse) but other female characters are more nuanced.",1390348800,,704,4.982905982905983

Really got into this series and I like Robert Parkers personalization of Jesse.  A lot of authors allow all their characters to enjoy the same inside jokes.  Jesse's personality seems to stand out as being different as he interacts with everyone else.",1387929600,,314,5.098039215686274

3062623,5,B00116GEK2,Tom Selleck portrays the character of Jesse Stone as if they were one and the same person.  Selleck is a natural for this role.  I also love him in the TV drama Blue Bloods.,1372982400,,173,4.0588235294117645

3062626,5,B00116GEK2,Bought a number of these episodes for a Christmas Present that was greatly appreciated.  Tom Selleck was a great choice for these Jesse Stone character movies.,1372377600,,159,5.115384615384615
3062627,5,B00116GEK2,"Tom Selleck is perfect in the role of Robert Parker's Jesse Stone, a police officer who gets the job done while battling with personal demons (divorce, drinking) that would sideline other men. The whole series is excellent with a great supporting cast (William Devane, Saul Rubinek, William Sadler, and others). The characters are believable, with interesting plot twists. A special mention must go out to the Golden Retriever that  plays Jesse's pet. His eyes speak volumes. Enjoyable to watch more than once, each time with a new perspective. Highly recommended!",1372118400,,564,5.266666666666667
3062628,5,B00116GEK2,"Love anything Tom does.
Jesse Stone is so human.  Although I believe R. Parker wrote the last few stories on happenings
in his own life, Tom Selleck makes it real and believable.  I watch them more than once.",1371945600,,208,4.447368421052632
3062629,5,B00116GEK2,So nice not to have every single thing spelled out for me like I'm a total idiot and have lots of unrealistic fake gun fire and cars blowing up for no reason.  These movies are interesting and witty.  Very easy to watch and fairly realistic IMO.  These feel like real people not like cartoon characters.  Five stars from me.,1371340800,,324,4.440677966101695

3062631,4,B00116GEK2,"I've enjoyed the made-for-TV versions of Robert B. Parker's Jesse Stone mysteries, and especially how Tom Selleck has made the role his own. He adds a charm and decency to a flawed and conflicted character who, played by another actor, could easily have become far less likeable. The production values are first-rate, and the well-cast supporting actors lend irresistible quirks and color. ""Sea Change"" is definitely one of the better installments of this series, which I think is best viewed in chronological order.",1371081600,,516,5.228915662650603

3062635,5,B00116GEK2,"Rose (played by Kathy Baker), replaces Mollie as the know-it-all dispatcher and nursemaid. She is empathetic, organized and a thorough officer for a young victim. Stone delegates to her as he does out of town interviews that lead to some interesting persons. He continues to wrestle with alcoholism and sees a shrink for it. Hasty Hathaway thrives in jail. Suitcase recovers from coma repeating a punchline read to him by Stone.
This episode it is Race Week in the harbor of Paradise and Jesse digs out a 15 year old homicide file. It involves a bank robbery, the teller taken as hostage and missing loot. Sean Young flirts with Stone, and other suspects exchange double entendres.
As already established, this series displays a quirky view of law enforcement. Stone is calculating, time worn but sensitive. Notice how the changeable seacoast is a major player in this video.",1370736000,,875,4.959183673469388
3062636,5,B00116GEK2,We have seen almost all of the Jesse Stone videos and they always hold your attention.  Tom Selleck is perfect for the roll of Jesse Stone.  Wish the series could go on longer.,1370649600,,176,4.303030303030303

3062654,4,B00116GEK2,"The Jessie Stone series are low key, small town cop mysteries. No gory, vicious violence, foul language or sex; a nice departure from more popular good guy/bad guy movies. Something you can watch with your kids without feeling uncomfortable. The only character I don't like in the series is Jessie's ex-wife, who still calls him, sometimes to let him know she's seeing someone else. Not sure why he keeps answering / returning her calls, but maybe I'd have to read the books to understand that. Tom Selleck doesn't wear short-shorts in any of these...too bad, nice legs...but there are always Magnum reruns for that!",1370044800,,616,4.9326923076923075

Recently I recorded ""Jesse Stone: Sea Change,"" and was half-way into the movie, when........................nada/zip/zilch.  Something had happened during the recording and I was left to guess at what would happen next and how Jesse solved the mystery.

Out of frustration, I turned on the computer and was VERY happy to find that this movie was available (free to PRIME members).  I also discovered that there is a WEALTH of other movies available (again, free to PRIME members) - including a number of Jesse Stone adventures.

To be perfectly honest, I am seriously considering dropping my satellite subscription - opting to watch the movies offered by Amazon: free of ads; no risk of a goof-up during recording; available when I want to watch - NOT when someone else decides to put them on a schedule.

OH!!  About ""Jesse Stone: Sea Change"".............................EXCELLENT!!!  The thing about this movie - or any of the others in this series - is that they are believable; VERY human (showing Jesse's weaknesses, as well as strengths); and they are unique in what they DON'T offer: huge helpings of sex and vulgar language.  (If those are things for which you are looking, Jesse Stone probably won't interest you.)",1365292800,,1353,5.132420091324201

In great measure, that is intentional because that enhances the same feeling about the Jesse Stone character.

I recommend the whole series and can't wait for more. But, don't expect new releases to come along quickly, Selleck has other irons in the fire, and these are low-budget project films.",1355875200,,523,4.943181818181818

3062772,5,B00116GEK2,"As with all the Jesse Stone novels by Robert Parker, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have now read all of the Jesse Stone series and started on Palmer's other books as well while waiting the next book in the series. If you have seen even one of the movies based upon these books you can also visualize and hear Tom Selleck as the indomitable Jesse Stone. If you haven't seen the movies, this book will want to make you start watching to see this series of books come to life. Not since Dances With The Wolves have I read a book(s) and seen movies made from them that are so true to the original work they are based upon. The other characters in the books also come to life in Palmer's writing even though those characters are not always the same from book to book. His ability to keep the same tone and excitement but change and add more depth is proven with each new book.

Each book is a stand alone and does not require reading the prior books in the series, but as you read the series you fill in and become engrossed with the residents of Paradise. Only Jesse Stone and a small number of his closest friends remain as the books evolve. Paradise expands with each book to become a small town you can imagine living and working in.  Usually seeing a movie made from a book keeps me from wanting to read the book, but not with this series. Here in Paradise, you will find yourself rooting and cheering for Jesse every step of the way as well as being amazed at his resiliency in surmounting the obstacle's thrown in his way both by circumstance and life itself.

Reading these books is not diminished by having seen a movie made from the book even though the movies are very true to the books.  The story lines and plots keep you wondering and engrossed until the very end and leave you wanting another round of Jesse Stone. Fortunately there appear to be more in Robert Palmer's mind yet to come!",1353542400,,1902,4.346478873239437

3062779,5,B00116GEK2,"""Sea Change"", the fourth of the Jesse Stone television movies, is one of the better productions, with a strong cast, two interesting mysteries, and of course Tom Selleck in a role perfectly suited to his mature acting talents.

As the story opens, Jesse Stone, police chief of the small New England seaport town of Paradise, is hitting the bottle rather harder than usual.  His psychiatrist Dr. Dix (a grizzled and pitch-perfect William Devane) suggests he find some work to do.  Jesse reopens an unsolved bank robbery and homicide, inadvertantly reopening old wounds inside and outside Paradise, and placing himself and others in danger.  Just to keep it interesting, an unwelcome rape case also drops into his lap, one that assistant Rose Gammon (Kathy Baker) insists that he solve.

Like the other Jesse Stone movies, ""Sea Change"" is populated by familiar faces from the earlier movies, along with some newcomers, including veteran actors Rebecca Pidgeon, Sean Young, and Nigel Bennett.  The pacing is slow, deliberate, and meditative, as Stone metes out his own brand of justice in both cases.  Series fans will not be disappointed; ""Sea Change"" is highly recommended to that audience.",1343692800,,1189,5.161458333333333
3062780,5,B00116GEK2,This whole series is great and this one does not disappoint. My only complaint is there are not more on this series.,1341964800,,116,4.318181818181818
3062791,5,B00116GEK2,"Hope there's never a sea-change for this series as it is done to perfection.  It evolves delightfully, adding layers to the depth of characters and plots.  In this episode, a cold case is revived.  Jesse looks more bored than his dog does, and his astute shrink suggests he finds something to interest him.  Great idea!

He asks an officer in his department about any old cold cases, and there are some--one that occurred in the past 20 years, in fact.  So, he starts sleuthing and finds some inconsistencies and shoddy detective work...which leads to a plot line I haven't seen before which is always fun.

Other beloved characters make cameo appearances and bring continuity and cohesiveness to the show.  As usual, there's the visually stunning scenery as a backdrop (Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada not MA, but who cares as it's gorgeous), the lyrical and haunting music, inspired acting and dialog and you never know where the script is heading which keeps it fresh.

I loved this particular episode.  Selleck seems even more comfortable with his role as Jesse Stone and I think he's even drinking less--the role suits him.  He needs a new love interest, however.  Maybe the next episode? I can't wait....",1338163200,,1206,4.886699507389163

That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well.

I just read the Parker novel the movie was based on. The movie may be called an adaption, but other than the current rape, the movie has almost nothing to do with the plot in the book. My suggestion would be to enjoy them as two separate stories. Don't expect to read Sea Change and find it replicated on the screen. In my opinion, the plot in the book was tighter and more complex than the movie, but the movie's version of Jess as a voice on the phone, but never seen, is more effective than her actual presence in the book.

3062844,5,B00116GEK2,"This is the fourth in the series centering around Police Chief Jesse Stone of Paradise, MA which may be a small town but is not quite a sleepy hollow. Instead, there is always some mystery lurking amidst the idyllic setting and this is nicely balanced with insightful characterizations of the leading players. Chief Jesse as played by Tom Selleck, is a multi-faceted character, a man of few words, but who is enigmatic and charismatic at the same time. Still battling inner demons [his alcoholism is very much part of the storyline, though it is not explored in depth, more of frequent shots showing Jesse downing one drink after another], and still in touch with his ex-wife, Chief Jesse ponders on his life which seems rather ho-hum, until something pops up in the form of an alleged rape during the town's Race Week, and also a 12-year-old cold case which Jesse re-opens.

If you like slow-simmering police procedurals that focus more on character development than action sequences, then this is a must-watch.

The writing in Sea Change is just bad. For some reason, Stone no longer likes Officer D'Angelo in this film. We are not told why he no longer likes him. Suitcase is given very little to do in this movie after he recovers. When he is onscreen, his performance is wooden. Molly is gone, but we are not entirely sure why she is gone. From the very beginning, it is as if we are already in the middle of the film. Stone is angry throughout the entire storyline. Angry without reason. This is possibly the worst scripting on any Tom Selleck film I have seen yet. I hope that in the next entry of Jesse Stone, the script writer who worked on this film has been fired and replaced with someone who knows how to write a quality script. There is virtually no action here and it moves with all of the excitement of dripping sap. If you have a choice between watching this moving and watching paint dry...watch the paint.

3062870,4,B00116GEK2,"If you liked the first three ""Jesse Stone"" TV films, you'll enjoy this one, too.  It's well acted, nicely shot, and there's a pretty good story, too, involving an old, unsolved bank heist and an unsavory crime aboard a visiting yacht.  However, this fourth adaptation (the first four movies are adapted from specific Robert B. Parker novels) also features a noticeable amount of repetition and wheel-spinning: Jesse once again is seen struggling with alcohol, with no progress one way or the other; he once again is seen fixating on his ex-wife Jenn, with no progress one way or the other; and he once again is seen helping a young person in an awkward, uncomfortable situation.  All that stuff is in the books, too, but for some reason those books (there are seven or eight of them at this point) don't come off as retreads of each other.  Maybe because the original novels are rich with plot and story points covering other themes, too, elements that couldn't be fit into the movies.

This repetition and lack of movement on certain issues still qualifies as a nit pick, though.  After all, how many of us struggle with certain issues indefinitely throughout our lives, and how many of us gravitate to addressing the same kinds of problems we see around us, the way Jesse zeroes in on troubled kids and tries to help them?  A lot of us on both counts, I'll wager.

Still, it'd be nice to see a Jesse Stone movie that would perhaps back-burner (not eliminate, just de-emphasize) the drinking, troubled youth, and the pining for the ex-wife, and explore other aspects of Jesse's character.  And that might happen: as I write this, the fifth and sixth ""Jesse Stone"" movies are in various stages of production, and they're not based on specific Parker novels, just the book series in general (the new movies will be called ""Thin Ice"" and ""No Remorse"").  So, we might get to see a little extra freshness in future installments of this already very good series of TV films.",1225929600,3,1969,4.714285714285714

3062890,5,B00116GEK2,"The second of a series we recently acquired, Death in Paradise is a great find because Tom Selleck is one of our favorite actors and we own the entire Magnum PI collection. In this series a more mature but still incredibly handsome Tom Selleck plays the character of the Chief of Police of a small New England town called Paradise, Massachusetts.

Jesse Stone is a former Los Angeles homicide detective who left life in the big city and is now underemployed, but still doing service to the community, which he loves. He is divorced from the ""only woman he is able to love"" but still talks to her each and every night, and is now seeing a psychiatrist who is helping him with his issues to attempt to stop his addiction to alcohol. At some point the shrink makes Jesse realize that he is able to avoid drinking only when a case is serious and has him totally involved in finding a solution, so he goes out of his way to find cases and tries to resolve an old murder that took place a few years back.

Life in Paradise is slow and for the most part the Chief of Police only gives out traffic or parking tickets. In this episode a local girl accuses a yachtsman of rape, a man who is visiting town during Racing Week which is rather important to the local economy.

The old robbery - murder case becomes rather interesting as we see the detective work uncovering details that finally solve the mystery. While the case is being solved, we have the opportunity to witness great photography and the scenes by the sea are simply magnificent. As with all DVD's, our favorite part is the opportunity to watch the special features and we saw the interview with Tom Selleck where we learned that he was involved in the production of this film.

Don't miss it, the pace is slow but introspective, the plot is deep and intelligent, and you are left with feeling admiration for a man that has done wrong things while always attempting to do what is right!",1215907200,,1941,4.459154929577465

3062893,4,B00116GEK2,"Tom Selleck again shows his diversity of acting in this movie which is the 4th DVD of a series of movies adapted to screen from the books by Robert Parker. Jesse Stone is a good police officer who leaves LAPD because of a divorce and a drinking problem and takes a job in a small town in Massachussetts called Paradise. There, with a small but tight knit force he solves a series of murders while trying to figure out his life which to him seems to be going down the toilet fast. If you like mystery, romance, and a good mix of good detective work than crawl up in your chair and watch this series as one would read a good book on a rainy day.

3062913,5,B00116GEK2,"""Sea Change"" is one of four stories by Robert B. Parker's Jesse Stone.  Tom Selleck is perfect for the part of Jesse Stone.  He is hired as Chief of Police in the town of Paradise as soneone the city council can lead around by the nose.  However, he proves himself to be not only an honest cop but is also superb at his job.  He is relentless when he goes after the ""bad guys"".  ""Sea Change"" no exception.  The story is riveting and at times keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Paradise is Jesse's last chance as his problem with alcohol caused him to be fired from his promising career as a detective in Las Angeles.  His struggles in ""Sea Change"" continue even to the point where he could lose his life if he gets to lost in the booze.  Robert B. Parker wrote dozens on stories about Jesse Stone and Tom Selleck has said in interviews that he would like to do them all.  Fans, including me, would like to see him do them all.  When you watch one episode you are hungry for anoter.  I hope that ""Sea Change"" isn't the last of the series filmed.  Tom Selleck has a part on a regular TV series and is surely busy but I hope he can take time to do another Jesse Stone soon.  ""Sea Change"" answered many questions but opened up new ones and Jesse Stone is still suffering with his alcohol problem.  I highly recommend ""Sea Change"" as well as the three preceeding stories; ""Night Passage"", ""Cold Stone"", and ""Death in Paradise"".  If you don't watch these movies you are really missing some fantastic stories and terrific acting.  I think you will agree that Tom is at his best as Jesse Stone.",1207353600,4,1588,4.292929292929293

(AND NOTHING BETTER HAPPEN TO REGGIE, EVER!) All of the Jesse Stone telefilms have been great, and Sea Change is no exception.

3295949,4,B00116GEK2,"""Jesse Stone: Sea Change"", the fourth TV adaptation of Robert B. Parker's novels of the alcoholic police chief of a tiny coastal town, again offers a terrific little character study/mystery, benefiting enormously from Tom Selleck's grizzled charm and integrity in the lead.

Things are slow in Paradise, and with Stone's ex asking him to quit calling (as she is ""seeing someone""), he finds himself sliding back to the bottle, alarming his friends and the City Council. Deciding to reopen an unsolved murder case from a dozen years earlier, to pass the time, his experience as an ex-L.A. cop soon offers clues that the case was mismanaged, and was far more than a simple bank hostage shooting. Then a father drags his pretty daughter in, claiming she had been raped by a contestant in the upcoming regatta, a charge that Stone is suspicious of, as the girl's behavior indicates a far different scenario. The two cases form the crux of a very interesting few days in Stone's life!

As always, the story is character-driven, with 'regulars' William Devane, Stephen McHattie, Kohl Sudduth, Vito Rezza, and Viola Davis joined by the always enjoyable Kathy Baker, assuming Davis' police job as she has a baby. With Saul Rubinek reprising his role as the money-laundering banker who hired Stone to be chief, the world-weary cop must also deal with a 'bad girl' (Sean Young, who STILL looks hot in a bikini), a 'good girl' with a secret (Rebecca Pidgeon), a crusty ex-bank guard (James Gammon), and an arrogant mobster (William Sadler), and his 'hitman' (James Rogers). And we mustn't forget Joe the Dog as Reggie, mute but reproving witness of Stone's nightly alcoholic 'fix'.

For audiences weaned on action-oriented 'Shoot-'em-Ups', the story may seem slow, but if you prefer your stories deeper than bullet counts, with well-etched characters, and Selleck's undeniable charm, the latest ""Stone"" film will be 100 minutes, well-spent!",1204848000,32,1928,5.075709779179811

Selleck nails the charm and despair Jesse has in the books just right. The rest of the acting is strong. The plot varies quite a bit from the book, but that is fine. The plot works. His psychiatrist tells him to find something important to do so Jesse decides to solve a cold case in his files. As soon as he gets started on the case, a questionable rape case is introduced. The mysteries plod along on their own path. Jesse slowly turns over the clues very skillfully using his LAPD experience and his knowledge of people. The scenery in New England is great.

3295952,5,B00116GEK2,"Robert B Parker has a hit character on his hands.  ""Sea Change""  is an old time detective story with Tom Selleck returning to his role as Chief Jesse Stone of Paradise Cove.

What does an ex Los Angeles cop do as a bored Chief of police?

If he's not drinking or issuing parking tickets, he's going through the files of the sloppy ex chief who passed away from corruption in the first installment of the series.  This time, he drags out a 15 year old bank robbery that appears to be a simple case.  With usual Paradise Cove proficiency, the files are incomplete and the excavated grave yields just enough evidence to pique his interest.

The pieces are scanty.  Blood stained clothing.  A sharp shooter security guard who claims he did not miss the robber.  A confession from a crooked bank manager who is 'fond of you (Jesse Stone)'.  Jesse finds himself attracted to a young lady seemingly caring for her mother with honest money.  All the pieces fall into place and the solution slams a romance into the ground.

The laid back, soft drinking Jesse deals with the money launderer, the bank robbers, and a perverted racer in town for the anual regatta.

This is a detective show with class.  Selleck portrays the self torturing Stone with high regard for the books the film is based on.  Not just another Magnum, Stone is a small town Philip Marlowe lying in wait for a diversion worthy of his time.

Sea Change challenges mystery and thriller lovers alike but will also delight those viewers who love wonderful, three-dimensional characterizations and first-class film making.

Frankly, each of these made-for-TV productions of the Jesse Stone books have had the look and feel of a movie.

Selleck is perfect as the brilliant Police Chief of a small town in New England, aptly named 'Paradise' in Massachusetts, who fled the big city which had brought him great professional success along with stress and a failed marriage.

He's wounded and lonely, and struggles with alchoholism. Much like Sherlock Holmes who sometimes took cocaine when he didn't have a case to challenge his sharp mental faculities, Stone has to have something 'important' to investigate or his addiction will consume him.

Abruptly desolate in the very quiet town, Stone decides to open a cold case and, in so doing, is able to set his glass down -- at least for a while. The case he selected is a 20-year-old bank robbery and murder.

The ensuing twists and turns of the investigation, and Stone's unorthodox but endearing style, is entertaining, intriguing and memorable.

Selleck is ably assisted by a very talented cast that includes the gifted Kathy Baker who plays Dispatcher/Officer Rose Gammon, the great Kohl Sudduth as Officer Luthor 'Suitcase' Simpson who awakes from a coma with 'special talents,' and Joe the Dog who plays Reggie.

Lets hope the remainder of the Jesse Stone novels get the same wonderful treatment and come to TV and DVD soon!",1197763200,106,1734,5.080985915492958

3296035,5,B00116GEK2,"I've had the opportunity to read all the Jesse Stone novels and watch the subsequent movies on dvd. What I can say that it is a rare thing when an actor (Tom Selleck) & author (Robert Parker) are so in tune with the character they create that one can't see any separation between the page and film. Jesse is a flawed hero, a man with demons but also with virtues constantly in battle with one another. It's only when Jesse is called out of his personal battle that his virtues lift him up and we can see the spirit of this tormented man. His struggles help personalize him because like all of us, he struggles with the knowledge of good and bad. His struggles, set backs, and victories is what makes us root for Jesse every time; and yet with every victory his demons return which reminds us that there are no simple solutions in life. Life us about that struggle. It's no wonder that two actors who have played characters created by Robert Parker have said those characters were their most challenging and favorite of their acting careers (Tom Selleck-Jesse Stone & Robert Urich-Spencer). If you like the flawed hero doing his best to do the right thing and taking the path of most resistance, then you will enjoy any of the Jesse Stone novels and films.

3296040,1,B00116GEK2,"I gave this movie one star because it had very little to do with the book. The opening credits said that the movie was based on Robert B. Parker's novel ""Sea Change"". I had just finished reading the book and whenever I read a book and there is a movie made from that book I really enjoy seeing the book come to life in a movie. Sometimes the movie isn't near as good as the book but most of the time the movie is enjoyable to watch.

The movie itself was not all that bad, At the most 3 stars. But to say the movie was based on the novel ""Sea Change"" was almost a complete lie. I say almost because the movie did mention one person from the book. Briefly. And the boat the ""Lady Jane"".

I like the Jesse Stone movies and look forward to watching more of them. But, if you are looking forward to watching the movie based on the novel you will be very disappointed.",1488153600,,863,4.070588235294117

""Unintended consequenses."" - Jesse Stone

Five IMPROBABLE Stars. ""Sea Change"" is a excellent edition in the binge-worthy, 9-episode Jesse Stone TV-series which is based on the best-selling novels by renowned author Robert B. Parker, starring award-winning actor Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone, the troubled police chief of the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts. It is the follow-on story that extends events which occurred in the preceding Jesse Stone TV-movie, ""Death in Paradise"", especially regarding the circumstance surrounding police officer, ""Suitcase"" Simpson. And there are major additions to the re-curring cast and some changes to others. This detail-laden edition whets the appetite to see what happens to the characters in the next Jesse Stone movie ""Thin Ice"" with different crime cases. It is very good as a stand-alone cop mystery although the new viewer will have to take some things for granted, and it is flat-out marvelous as part of the overall 9-part series. Even better on the second viewing.

Things get very entertaining and twisty as Stone goes to the shrink to solve some recurring personal problems and opens up a cold case at work just for the challenge. Meanwhile, the second storyline threatens to disturb the burgh of Paradise at the wrong time of the tourist season. Co-starring Kathy Baker in her initial episode, Kohl Sudduth, Rebecca Pidgeon, Sean Young (yes, Blade Runner), Mika Boorem, Stephen McHattie, William Sadler, James Gammon, James Preston Rogers, Nigel Bennett, Vito Rezza, and Saul Rubinek, with Viola Davis and William Devane.

All the actors are well casted, and they present real people that you can like.  Paradise is an idyllic northern town that we feel is a rarity in America today, where people know each other and care.  The plot is almost a second concern, but there is always a puzzle to tease apart.  Naturally, there is always a happy ending.  These stories are real comfort food.",1469059200,,548,4.540816326530612

3296163,5,B00116GEK2,"All the Jesse Stone cop/mystery videos I've watched to date, 6 of them, have been great. I wasn't really a cop/mystery fan, vids or books, until I watched Tom Selleck and William Devane in this collection. I accidentally found them in my local public library and picked one to fill out my allotted four vid check outs and became an instant convert. Selleck is a fine actor, perfect in his deadpan, serious cop business, glib humor, functioning alcoholic role as Jesse Stone. (Jonny Walker Red Label scotch sales must have gone up as a consequence.) Selleck also directs some of the films. William Devane is also great as a former cop, now retired and a psychiatrist trying to quit smoking - all his life, apparently. He is trying, unsuccessfully, to help Jesse cope with his divorce, the death of his girlfriend and dog - ""Why is this so hard?"". I won't forget Reggie and Steve (Joe, the red Airedale) as his conscience. Robert Parker created the character of Stone in a sub-series of his many books, one of which I am now reading. The vids are generally composites of Parker's Stone stories and there is some redundancy in dialog and storyline, but it isn't really annoying or boring, I only regret I discovered Parker six years after his death in 2010.",1464998400,,1254,4.678733031674208

3296194,4,B00116GEK2,"I am systematically viewing each of the Jesse Stone films and Sea Change is the fifth film I have reviewed.

The makers of this series have established a pattern for how the films are made.  We have a major plot and a minor plot in each story.  In Sea Change the minor plot involves a young girl who accuses a visitor to Paradise of raping her on his yacht.  Right from the beginning Jesse doubts the accuracy of her statements and passes the case off to Kathy Bates, who mans the phones in the small Paradise police office.

Jesse is so bored that he digs up a cold case, a bank robbery and murder that is over ten years old.  This cold case gives us the major plot for this installment of the series and it turns out to be a complicated problem for Jesse to solve, but solve it he does, and in convincing fashion.

Our director, Robert Harmon, is a former camera man who is expert in shooting this film, which always looks great.  Harmon has directed several other of the Jesse Stone films and he understands how this franchise is supposed to work.  Tom Selleck is the star and also the executive producer of the film.  Harmon and Selleck work closely together to give us a predictable pattern both in story-telling and in character development.

Tom Sellecks character Jesse Stone is world weary, always, in these films.  That said, he is able to rouse himself from time to time when action is called for, but that is not often.  Instead Jesse talks frequently with his other police officers and occasionally with his psychiatrist, ably played by William Devane.  Sadly, Jesse also talks in every episode with his divorced wife Jen, who calls him to check up on him and his drinking problem.  For me these predictable conversations Jesse has with his former wife are the weakest part of these films and I groan when she calls again and they begin one of their innocuous conversations.

Jesse drinks too much  that is a continuing feature of these films and he discusses his problem with Devane, but the psychiatrist doesnt seem to be able to make much progress with Jesse.  Even so, their banter back and forth is fun to listen to.

The Jesse Stone series are mysteries based on the Robert Parker books and typically Jesse does a convincing job as a detective.  His skills as a police officer keep me coming back to see how he will solve his next case.

Im giving Sea Change four stars; it was good, but not great, and I am hoping Jesse returns to form in the next film I view in this series.",1459987200,,2495,4.4635761589403975

3296616,4,B00116GEK2,"What I love about the Jesse Stone novels is that you never know what you're going to get. Of course you know the characters, but some are intense and emotional, while others focus more on the mystery and small town politics. Sea Change was an interesting choice for the fourth film, as it shows a different side of Jesse and was somewhat unique among the other stories. Jesse Stone (Tom Selleck), was an L.A. Homicide Detective, who left to become a small town police chief in Massachusetts, after his life was thrown into chaos. Now that he's been there a while, he's come to realize that not a lot of things happen in a small town, and he's tired of writing parking tickets. Craving something to do, Stone decides to open the towns only unsolved murder. A body found in the woods, 20 years earlier. As he opens the investigation, it brings up the past, a past that the town of Paradise would like to forget. Sea Change plays more like a Cold Case or Criminal Minds episode than a typical Jesse Stone story, but what's unique about it, is that it really gives us a look inside Jesse's life. Tom Selleck was terrific as always, but he gives a particularly special performance in Sea Change. We finally see the man for what he is, driven by justice and living for the people. His job is his life and when there is nothing to do, he falls back into and becomes stuck in his past. Sea Change is also special as it was the novel that introduces us to the character of Rose Gammon, played by Kathy Baker. I haven't seen her in anything since Picket Fences and God did I love that show! It was really thrilling for me to see her again, and playing a character I really came to admire in the novels. Sea Change might not have the action that younger viewers crave in their police dramas, but it is a textbook example of how to solve a case and a unique look into the mind of one of the deepest characters I know. I loved the books and rarely do these types of stories translate well to film, but with a star like Tom Selleck you can't go wrong and I really did enjoy this film as much as I did the novel.",1408838400,,2097,4.271356783919598

So when he's not challenged to solve a murder or something as police chief of a small town, he spends his time drinking Johnny Walker red scotch and talking with his dog.

The story lines of this series of movies is very good and I am constantly looking forward to watching the next in the series.

I need to see this Jesses Stone series continue. We need to find a fan blog or website to promote this idea. Perhaps a network will see it worthy to do so and let the story telling of Jesse Stone continue. Try out viewing the first Jesse Stone movie Night Passage on Amazon Prime or just rent it from any other video online service you use. I assure you that you will be hooked. For more about the Jesse Stone series viewing order and short overview of each one, check out this link: mommybearmedia dot com.
  By the way, I just bought the movie soundtrack online. Check out the listing on Amazon. But, look at the customer reviews and see instructions how to buy the soundtrack directly from the music creator who is award winning Jeff Beal. The soundtrack is out of production by the record label but, you can get it from Jeff Beal himself. I am really enjoying the music. This is a great example of the power of customer reviews on Amazon to help consumers like me get access to things that are important to them.

My husband and I, who generally have diverging tastes, enjoyed it as did my 21-year-old son.  I particularly enjoy the characters who are allowed to have back stories that don't overwhelm the central story line.  People aren't one dimensional.  The protagonist is full of self absorbed and self pitying. Recurring bad guys aren't simply bad guys -- they have their own lines in the sand or are acting out a character flaw; they are not complete monsters. There's still a problem depicting good looking young women (all of whom throw themselves at Jesse) but other female characters are more nuanced.",1390348800,,704,4.982905982905983

Really got into this series and I like Robert Parkers personalization of Jesse.  A lot of authors allow all their characters to enjoy the same inside jokes.  Jesse's personality seems to stand out as being different as he interacts with everyone else.",1387929600,,314,5.098039215686274

The whole series is excellent with a great supporting cast (William Devane, Saul Rubinek, William Sadler, and others). The characters are believable, with interesting plot twists. A special mention must go out to the Golden Retriever that  plays Jesse's pet. His eyes speak volumes. Enjoyable to watch more than once, each time with a new perspective. Highly recommended!",1372118400,,564,5.266666666666667

3297128,4,B00116GEK2,"I've enjoyed the made-for-TV versions of Robert B. Parker's Jesse Stone mysteries, and especially how Tom Selleck has made the role his own. He adds a charm and decency to a flawed and conflicted character who, played by another actor, could easily have become far less likeable. The production values are first-rate, and the well-cast supporting actors lend irresistible quirks and color. ""Sea Change"" is definitely one of the better installments of this series, which I think is best viewed in chronological order.",1371081600,,516,5.228915662650603

Stone delegates to her as he does out of town interviews that lead to some interesting persons. He continues to wrestle with alcoholism and sees a shrink for it. Hasty Hathaway thrives in jail. Suitcase recovers from coma repeating a punchline read to him by Stone.
This episode it is Race Week in the harbor of Paradise and Jesse digs out a 15 year old homicide file. It involves a bank robbery, the teller taken as hostage and missing loot. Sean Young flirts with Stone, and other suspects exchange double entendres.
As already established, this series displays a quirky view of law enforcement. Stone is calculating, time worn but sensitive. Notice how the changeable seacoast is a major player in this video.",1370736000,,875,4.959183673469388

Something you can watch with your kids without feeling uncomfortable. The only character I don't like in the series is Jessie's ex-wife, who still calls him, sometimes to let him know she's seeing someone else. Not sure why he keeps answering / returning her calls, but maybe I'd have to read the books to understand that. Tom Selleck doesn't wear short-shorts in any of these...too bad, nice legs...but there are always Magnum reruns for that!",1370044800,,616,4.9326923076923075

Recently I recorded ""Jesse Stone: Sea Change,"" and was half-way into the movie, when........................nada/zip/zilch.  Something had happened during the recording and I was left to guess at what would happen next and how Jesse solved the mystery.

Out of frustration, I turned on the computer and was VERY happy to find that this movie was available (free to PRIME members).  I also discovered that there is a WEALTH of other movies available (again, free to PRIME members) - including a number of Jesse Stone adventures.

To be perfectly honest, I am seriously considering dropping my satellite subscription - opting to watch the movies offered by Amazon: free of ads; no risk of a goof-up during recording; available when I want to watch - NOT when someone else decides to put them on a schedule.

OH!!  About ""Jesse Stone: Sea Change"".............................EXCELLENT!!!  The thing about this movie - or any of the others in this series - is that they are believable; VERY human (showing Jesse's weaknesses, as well as strengths); and they are unique in what they DON'T offer: huge helpings of sex and vulgar language.

3297269,5,B00116GEK2,"As with all the Jesse Stone novels by Robert Parker, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have now read all of the Jesse Stone series and started on Palmer's other books as well while waiting the next book in the series. If you have seen even one of the movies based upon these books you can also visualize and hear Tom Selleck as the indomitable Jesse Stone. If you haven't seen the movies, this book will want to make you start watching to see this series of books come to life. Not since Dances With The Wolves have I read a book(s) and seen movies made from them that are so true to the original work they are based upon. The other characters in the books also come to life in Palmer's writing even though those characters are not always the same from book to book. His ability to keep the same tone and excitement but change and add more depth is proven with each new book.

Each book is a stand alone and does not require reading the prior books in the series, but as you read the series you fill in and become engrossed with the residents of Paradise. Only Jesse Stone and a small number of his closest friends remain as the books evolve. Paradise expands with each book to become a small town you can imagine living and working in.  Usually seeing a movie made from a book keeps me from wanting to read the book, but not with this series. Here in Paradise, you will find yourself rooting and cheering for Jesse every step of the way as well as being amazed at his resiliency in surmounting the obstacle's thrown in his way both by circumstance and life itself.

Reading these books is not diminished by having seen a movie made from the book even though the movies are very true to the books.  The story lines and plots keep you wondering and engrossed until the very end and leave you wanting another round of Jesse Stone. Fortunately there appear to be more in Robert Palmer's mind yet to come!",1353542400,,1902,4.346478873239437

3297276,5,B00116GEK2,"""Sea Change"", the fourth of the Jesse Stone television movies, is one of the better productions, with a strong cast, two interesting mysteries, and of course Tom Selleck in a role perfectly suited to his mature acting talents.

As the story opens, Jesse Stone, police chief of the small New England seaport town of Paradise, is hitting the bottle rather harder than usual.  His psychiatrist Dr. Dix (a grizzled and pitch-perfect William Devane) suggests he find some work to do.  Jesse reopens an unsolved bank robbery and homicide, inadvertantly reopening old wounds inside and outside Paradise, and placing himself and others in danger.  Just to keep it interesting, an unwelcome rape case also drops into his lap, one that assistant Rose Gammon (Kathy Baker) insists that he solve.

Like the other Jesse Stone movies, ""Sea Change"" is populated by familiar faces from the earlier movies, along with some newcomers, including veteran actors Rebecca Pidgeon, Sean Young, and Nigel Bennett.  The pacing is slow, deliberate, and meditative, as Stone metes out his own brand of justice in both cases.  Series fans will not be disappointed; ""Sea Change"" is highly recommended to that audience.",1343692800,,1189,5.161458333333333
3297277,5,B00116GEK2,This whole series is great and this one does not disappoint. My only complaint is there are not more on this series.,1341964800,,116,4.318181818181818
3297288,5,B00116GEK2,"Hope there's never a sea-change for this series as it is done to perfection.  It evolves delightfully, adding layers to the depth of characters and plots.  In this episode, a cold case is revived.  Jesse looks more bored than his dog does, and his astute shrink suggests he finds something to interest him.  Great idea!

He asks an officer in his department about any old cold cases, and there are some--one that occurred in the past 20 years, in fact.  So, he starts sleuthing and finds some inconsistencies and shoddy detective work...which leads to a plot line I haven't seen before which is always fun.

Other beloved characters make cameo appearances and bring continuity and cohesiveness to the show.  As usual, there's the visually stunning scenery as a backdrop (Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada not MA, but who cares as it's gorgeous), the lyrical and haunting music, inspired acting and dialog and you never know where the script is heading which keeps it fresh.

I loved this particular episode.  Selleck seems even more comfortable with his role as Jesse Stone and I think he's even drinking less--the role suits him.  He needs a new love interest, however.  Maybe the next episode? I can't wait....",1338163200,,1206,4.886699507389163

That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well.

I just read the Parker novel the movie was based on. The movie may be called an adaption, but other than the current rape, the movie has almost nothing to do with the plot in the book. My suggestion would be to enjoy them as two separate stories. Don't expect to read Sea Change and find it replicated on the screen. In my opinion, the plot in the book was tighter and more complex than the movie, but the movie's version of Jess as a voice on the phone, but never seen, is more effective than her actual presence in the book.

3297341,5,B00116GEK2,"This is the fourth in the series centering around Police Chief Jesse Stone of Paradise, MA which may be a small town but is not quite a sleepy hollow. Instead, there is always some mystery lurking amidst the idyllic setting and this is nicely balanced with insightful characterizations of the leading players. Chief Jesse as played by Tom Selleck, is a multi-faceted character, a man of few words, but who is enigmatic and charismatic at the same time. Still battling inner demons [his alcoholism is very much part of the storyline, though it is not explored in depth, more of frequent shots showing Jesse downing one drink after another], and still in touch with his ex-wife, Chief Jesse ponders on his life which seems rather ho-hum, until something pops up in the form of an alleged rape during the town's Race Week, and also a 12-year-old cold case which Jesse re-opens.

If you like slow-simmering police procedurals that focus more on character development than action sequences, then this is a must-watch.

The writing in Sea Change is just bad. For some reason, Stone no longer likes Officer D'Angelo in this film. We are not told why he no longer likes him. Suitcase is given very little to do in this movie after he recovers. When he is onscreen, his performance is wooden. Molly is gone, but we are not entirely sure why she is gone. From the very beginning, it is as if we are already in the middle of the film. Stone is angry throughout the entire storyline. Angry without reason. This is possibly the worst scripting on any Tom Selleck film I have seen yet. I hope that in the next entry of Jesse Stone, the script writer who worked on this film has been fired and replaced with someone who knows how to write a quality script. There is virtually no action here and it moves with all of the excitement of dripping sap. If you have a choice between watching this moving and watching paint dry...watch the paint.

3297367,4,B00116GEK2,"If you liked the first three ""Jesse Stone"" TV films, you'll enjoy this one, too.  It's well acted, nicely shot, and there's a pretty good story, too, involving an old, unsolved bank heist and an unsavory crime aboard a visiting yacht.  However, this fourth adaptation (the first four movies are adapted from specific Robert B. Parker novels) also features a noticeable amount of repetition and wheel-spinning: Jesse once again is seen struggling with alcohol, with no progress one way or the other; he once again is seen fixating on his ex-wife Jenn, with no progress one way or the other; and he once again is seen helping a young person in an awkward, uncomfortable situation.  All that stuff is in the books, too, but for some reason those books (there are seven or eight of them at this point) don't come off as retreads of each other.  Maybe because the original novels are rich with plot and story points covering other themes, too, elements that couldn't be fit into the movies.

This repetition and lack of movement on certain issues still qualifies as a nit pick, though.  After all, how many of us struggle with certain issues indefinitely throughout our lives, and how many of us gravitate to addressing the same kinds of problems we see around us, the way Jesse zeroes in on troubled kids and tries to help them?  A lot of us on both counts, I'll wager.

Still, it'd be nice to see a Jesse Stone movie that would perhaps back-burner (not eliminate, just de-emphasize) the drinking, troubled youth, and the pining for the ex-wife, and explore other aspects of Jesse's character.  And that might happen: as I write this, the fifth and sixth ""Jesse Stone"" movies are in various stages of production, and they're not based on specific Parker novels, just the book series in general (the new movies will be called ""Thin Ice"" and ""No Remorse"").  So, we might get to see a little extra freshness in future installments of this already very good series of TV films.",1225929600,3,1969,4.714285714285714

3297387,5,B00116GEK2,"The second of a series we recently acquired, Death in Paradise is a great find because Tom Selleck is one of our favorite actors and we own the entire Magnum PI collection. In this series a more mature but still incredibly handsome Tom Selleck plays the character of the Chief of Police of a small New England town called Paradise, Massachusetts.

Jesse Stone is a former Los Angeles homicide detective who left life in the big city and is now underemployed, but still doing service to the community, which he loves. He is divorced from the ""only woman he is able to love"" but still talks to her each and every night, and is now seeing a psychiatrist who is helping him with his issues to attempt to stop his addiction to alcohol. At some point the shrink makes Jesse realize that he is able to avoid drinking only when a case is serious and has him totally involved in finding a solution, so he goes out of his way to find cases and tries to resolve an old murder that took place a few years back.

Life in Paradise is slow and for the most part the Chief of Police only gives out traffic or parking tickets. In this episode a local girl accuses a yachtsman of rape, a man who is visiting town during Racing Week which is rather important to the local economy.

The old robbery - murder case becomes rather interesting as we see the detective work uncovering details that finally solve the mystery. While the case is being solved, we have the opportunity to witness great photography and the scenes by the sea are simply magnificent. As with all DVD's, our favorite part is the opportunity to watch the special features and we saw the interview with Tom Selleck where we learned that he was involved in the production of this film.

Don't miss it, the pace is slow but introspective, the plot is deep and intelligent, and you are left with feeling admiration for a man that has done wrong things while always attempting to do what is right!",1215907200,,1941,4.459154929577465

There, with a small but tight knit force he solves a series of murders while trying to figure out his life which to him seems to be going down the toilet fast.

3297394,5,B00116GEK2,"This is some of Tom Sellecks best movies, his performances in all 4 movies in this series is as good as it gets. He plays the part of Jesse Stone as if it were real. Would love to see more of Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone in the future.",1209859200,,233,3.7755102040816326
3297395,5,B00116GEK2,First class mystery series. Tom selleck portrays this interesting imperfect character created by Robert B. Parker. The episodes are all well done with an excellent supporting cast. The locations shots of a small new england  town are perfect. A very welcome entertaining show. Unfortunately Parker only wrote seven Jesse Stone novels. My hope is that the last three will be produced completing the series.,1209254400,,405,5.328125
3297396,5,B00116GEK2,"Men react to separation and divorce differently than do women.  If such a man still loves his ex-wife - his hurt is soul-deep.  Law enforcement men are one group particularly susceptible to heart-hurt.  Jesse Stone via Tom Selleck is such a man.  Tom Selleck reveals who and what Chief Stone is.  Jesse is a man of few words.  He doesn't whine, doesn't moan.  He's honest and straight-forward.  If you like 'seeing inside' both honorable and dishonorable folks, and enjoy slowly-tightening suspense, coupled with juicy murders, under-world criminal behavior in 'out-of-the-way' places, and humor,  'Sea change' is one of a Jesse Stone series you will enjoy.",1208390400,,657,5.180952380952381
3297397,5,B00116GEK2,"I'm a Tom Selleck fan so when this series began I bought them all as they became available.  I've never been dissappointed. I think they're great! Mr. Selleck makes me really care about Jesse. The stories are teriffic. Love Mr. Parker's writing.  Can hardly wait for the next one.  Remember, Tom, you promised to make at least one a year.",1207958400,,338,4.6

3297410,5,B00116GEK2,"""Sea Change"" is one of four stories by Robert B. Parker's Jesse Stone.  Tom Selleck is perfect for the part of Jesse Stone.  He is hired as Chief of Police in the town of Paradise as soneone the city council can lead around by the nose.  However, he proves himself to be not only an honest cop but is also superb at his job.  He is relentless when he goes after the ""bad guys"".  ""Sea Change"" no exception.  The story is riveting and at times keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Paradise is Jesse's last chance as his problem with alcohol caused him to be fired from his promising career as a detective in Las Angeles.  His struggles in ""Sea Change"" continue even to the point where he could lose his life if he gets to lost in the booze.  Robert B. Parker wrote dozens on stories about Jesse Stone and Tom Selleck has said in interviews that he would like to do them all.  Fans, including me, would like to see him do them all.  When you watch one episode you are hungry for anoter.  I hope that ""Sea Change"" isn't the last of the series filmed.  Tom Selleck has a part on a regular TV series and is surely busy but I hope he can take time to do another Jesse Stone soon.  ""Sea Change"" answered many questions but opened up new ones and Jesse Stone is still suffering with his alcohol problem.  I highly recommend ""Sea Change"" as well as the three preceeding stories; ""Night Passage"", ""Cold Stone"", and ""Death in Paradise"".  If you don't watch these movies you are really missing some fantastic stories and terrific acting.  I think you will agree that Tom is at his best as Jesse Stone.",1207353600,4,1588,4.292929292929293
3297411,3,B00116GEK2,"This is a good movie, as are the others in the Jesse Stone/Tom Selleck  series.  I am glad I purchased it.  I enjoy Tom Selleck's work very much (ever since ""Magnum, P.I.""), and he is excellent as Jesse Stone.  However, I was disappointed.  I am a big fan of Robert B. Parker (I have read and enjoyed immensely all of his books.), and this movie has very little to do with his great novel. Perhaps it should have had a different title so as not to mislead viewers who are familiar with the novel.",1207353600,5,496,4.23404255319149
3297412,5,B00116GEK2,"The Jesse Stone series is drama well-done. The viewer immediately feels empathy for the police chief and his marital issues, and is caught up in the intrigue of each case he faces and tries to solve. The supporting cast is excellent, too. I rented the series from NetFlix, then purchased them from Amazon to watch again. Thank you, Tom Selleck, for giving your creative energies to this fine series. Please keep them coming!",1207353600,2,424,4.821917808219178

3297414,5,B00116GEK2,"We really like this series and hope it keeps coming as long as it can stay this good. I've enjoyed Selleck's work for twenty years, and this is one of his best characters/performances.  The regulars in the series (Kohl Sudduth, Viola Davis) provide great context for him, as do semi-regulars William Devane and Saul Rubinek.  Best of all is his primary co-star, Joe the Dog as Reggie.  (AND NOTHING BETTER HAPPEN TO REGGIE, EVER!) All of the Jesse Stone telefilms have been great, and Sea Change is no exception.  Loved the turns by James Gammon as a bank guard and Sean Young (still lookin' good!) as a film noir-type gal.  Great locations and cinematography, intelligent script and good acting.  Refreshing to see there are still teams making films who know how to deliver all that.  Thanks, Tom; keep 'em coming!",1206748800,8,815,4.7785714285714285

movies. tom selleck makes it a pleasure to watch.
i've read robert b. parkers book version, and i like the movie version

3297416,5,B00116GEK2,This is the fourth DVD in the series of stories based on the Robert Parker books featuring Jesse Stone.  The entire series of DVDs are very well done and are true to the storyline and feel of the books.  I would recommend these DVDs to anyone who enjoys good crime drama and good character studies. Stone is a tortured soul and a good cop and you immediately become immersed in his story.  This is good stuff!,1206230400,4,409,4.355263157894737
