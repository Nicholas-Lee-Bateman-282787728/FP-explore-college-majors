8483183,2,B005QBNYHO,"""George White's 1935 Scandals"" is a dull musical review which showcased Alice Faye's singing, one number by Eleanor Powell and not much else. Alice Faye is on record as stating that costs were being cut at Fox and it shows. As a record of a Broadway review, it has some interest but the script is rotten, the direction featureless and the performances dull. The musical numbers are poorly staged with lots of chorus girls in fussy costumes doing very little and the songs are not memorable. Faye lets loose in her big number, ""Oh, I didn't know"", a companion piece to ""Nasty Man"" the number with which she stole the show from the previous year's Scandals, when she made her film debut. Once again, she steals the show. Her singing is good but her acting is poor, although with such poor direction, who could blame her. She also is harshly made up.

The film has been issued in the Fox Archive Series; that means bare bones and expensive. The print is clean enough but lacks clarity - contrasts are murky and the overall impression is as mediocre as the film.  For Alice Faye fans only.",1421107200,,1085,4.558974358974359

8483185,3,B005QBNYHO,"This 1935 movie, based on George White's Broadway revue of the same name, is not very good.  It does have some big, or soon-to-be-big, names - Alice Faye (Mrs. Phil Harris), James Dunn (who was in Shirley Temple's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stand-Up-and-Cheer/dp/B000LC4ZEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stand Up and Cheer!</a>), and Cliff Edwards (later Ukelele Ike and the voice of Jiminy Cricket).  The highlight of the film is Eleanor Powell's first major role - she plays a dancer named Marilyn Collins.  Ellie was only 23, but even then showed that her tap-dancing skills were much more advanced than her contemporary, Ruby Keeler.  While Ann Miller was born a decade after Powell and Keeler, she made her film debut just two years after this picture, in NEW FACES OF 1937, which RKO Pictures has never released on either VHS or DVD (I saw it on late-night TV many years ago).  Miller was only 14 at the time, though she lied about her age (she pretended to be 16) to obtain the part.

The rest of this film is mediocre at best. George White's dancing girls are not as pretty as Busby Berkeley's, and they can't dance very well either.  Obviously, Fox Film Corporation, which later merged with 20th Century Pictures to form 20th Century-Fox, was desparately trying to copy the success of the Warner Brothers Berkeley musicals, but failed.

Last year, I ordered the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loving-The-Classics-LTC-version/dp/B005QBNYHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loving The Classics (LTC) version</a>&nbsp;of this film, which came from someone's private recording of a Fox Movie Channel broadcast. At the time, I only gave the movie two stars (except for Ellie's dance, which is five stars), but this new print, while not pristine, is a lot better, so I'll add an extra star and bring it up to three stars. Considering that the film was not a big hit, will be 80 years old in 2015, and probably rotted away in the Fox vaults for several decades - as another reviewer pointed out, it was never issued on VHS tape - the restorers did as well as they could with what they had. Unlike the LTC version, which had several breaks in the film (or maybe the homemade videotape it was copied from), this version plays uninterrupted. No extras, though, because it's a DVD-R.

Okay, 20th Century-Fox, now that this mediocre film has been officially re-released, where are the official DVD releases of Shirley Temple's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poor-Little-Rich-Girl/dp/6301802527/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poor Little Rich Girl</a>, and Glenn Miller's first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sun-Valley-Serenade/dp/6302136229/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sun Valley Serenade</a>, which have only been released on VHS in this country, though non-compatible DVD versions (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/7807295708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B001ANUSTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>) have been issued in Europe. Have legal issues prevented an official U.S. DVD release of these two films?",1406073600,4,3323,6.366666666666666
8483186,4,B005QBNYHO,"Considering that this film is from 1935 and probably hasn't been out of the Fox vaults in many, many years, I'm not too awfully surprised that the condition of the original master material available for transfer was in not the best condition. To that problem, they state that right up front with a disclaimer. This film was never on available on VHS.

 I'm just happy that some one at Fox finally wised up to the fact that there are people out there who love their roster of actors from the 1930s and who are willing to fork over money to buy these DVDs.

That said, George White's Scandals of 1935 is basically Fox Films' (before they were 20th Century Fox) version of MGM'S ""The Ziegfeld Follies"", but with a different story line. Two struggling vaudevillians (James Dunn and Alice Faye) are discovered when Broadway impresario George White gets off a Florida bound train and discovers a small town shyster is using his name to put over a show. The real George White (no kind of actor but better than most non-actors) appears as himself.

James Dunn, best known in Shirley Temple films (and wonderful in ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"") is very capable as a song and dance man. At this point in time, Fox had Alice Faye in her Jean Harlow - look, which (than goodness) they abandoned once Darryl F. Zanuck took over.

Probably the most notable song is ""Nasty Man"", which I'm sure was quite controversial at the time!

As with all the Fox Cinema Archives DVDs, there are no extras: no chapter index, no fancy inserts, no commentaries, no extras of any kind - just the movie.",1396742400,5,1570,4.569395017793594
8483187,4,B005QBNYHO,"The film used in this transfer to DVD is not DAMAGED and DIRTY as stated by another reviewer.  There are no emulsion lines and the images are clear.  What damage?????  When I see a musical, I want lots of good songs, dancing, and singing.  With this film, you get plenty of each.  Alice Faye is delightful with that deep, torchy contralto; Cliff Edwards is one of a kind - a comedian with an excellent singing voice; and Lyda Roberti is contagious.  Eleanor Powell makes one of her very first appearances on film, and she really sizzles on the dance floor.  There's not a heavy plot, but who wants it in a breezy musical revue with some good songs.",1391299200,11,648,4.440677966101695
8483188,1,B005QBNYHO,"I have never seen such a dirty and damaged picture. The real scandal is to ask $19.98 for that. $10 or so could me more honest. It's been five years since the MOD became the norm for older movies, to see that there is still no effort from a studio like Fox is really depressing; I give up DVDs after watching this. Amazon should be ashamed of being an accessory of this racket.",1390608000,5,377,4.178082191780822

This DVD was manufactured by Loving The Classics (LTC), an online firm that specializes in copying public-domain (out-of-copyright) films for fans and collectors. When I played the disc, it started with a homemade menu, much like you or I would make for one of our own DVDs. When I started to play the movie, the 20th Century-Fox fanfare was partially cut off, and there were several scenes when the film broke and the screen went black for a moment, then restarted again. At the end of the film, there was another surprise: a promo for Movies From Fox (fxM), now known as the Fox Movie Channel, with a plug for their next picture, a 1985 Candace Bergen TV-movie called MURDER: BY REASON OF INSANITY, and then the video picture switched to the beginning of another TV-movie from 1996, GIANT MINE. I had never heard of either of these titles, and had to look them up online to obtain information about them.

Obviously, this copy of GEORGE WHITE'S 1935 SCANDALS came from a movie buff who had taped the film off the air from the Fox Movie Channel, and then LTC transferred it to a DVD-R. The picture and sound quality are so poor that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reveille-with-Beverly/dp/B005QQWH54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reveille with Beverly</a>, which I also purchased from Amazon, through LTC, looks pristine by comparison.

When purchasing public-domain movies from Amazon.com, an Amazon Merchant, directly from LTC, or any other Web site, please remember that since the movies are out of copyright and that the original negatives are unavailable, or may not exist at all, you may get a copy of an out-of-print commercial VHS transferred to a homemade DVD, or a copy obtained from a collector who taped it off the air from TV, as this movie was. Lesson: you get what you pay for.

I don't think that 20th Century-Fox should waste time restoring this mediocre film. There are two other Fox musicals that I would rather see released on official DVDs: Shirley Temple's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poor-Little-Rich-Girl/dp/6301802527/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poor Little Rich Girl</a>, and Glenn Miller's first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sun-Valley-Serenade/dp/6302136229/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sun Valley Serenade</a>, which have only been released on VHS in this country, though non-compatible DVD versions (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/7807295708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B001ANUSTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>) have been issued in Europe.
