3965257,3,B002PMVQ4U,This is a transfer from a video tape that used to be found in the old mom and pop video stores. The material is dated and upon viewing one is reminded that a lot has happened in terms of what can be seen in the world particularly by internet. The documentary has few spotted parts of interest but is now passe.,1291420800,2,310,4.098360655737705

8377121,2,B002PMVQ4U,"This might have shocked Westerners 40 to 50 years ago, maybe the first installment was even a hit--they did make a sequel! But any casual tourist to SE Asia can see these things on the streets.... transgender people, prostitutes, fried insect snacks. The film is more revealing about the people who would be ""shocked"" at its viewing than anything else. A novelty from a different era!",1490486400,,384,4.833333333333333

8377126,5,B002PMVQ4U,"I like this movie.  It is definitely shocking.  I've seen stuff like this in other movies, but didn't really believe it after seeing this one made me think twice",1359331200,,161,4.517241379310345

8377129,3,B002PMVQ4U,"I watched Part One of this years back, and wanted to watch it again, so thought I'd order it from here, rather than go to some mom & pop video store to find it.  You can definitely tell it was copied from the VHS form, but unlike other reviewers, I couldn't tell what was missing. (Probably b/c it's been such a long time since I originally watched it). Decent DVD for a decent price...",1304899200,3,386,4.216216216216216
