2163301,5,B00062IVPI,I saw these films on those rainy Saturday afternoon movie presentations on tv during the 60's & 70's when I was growing up on a farm in central Texas.  I liked em then and I still like em in spite of all the cgi efx we now enjoy on film.  There was something special about these movies that you just have to experience to appreciate.  Like OZ and King Kong- the old efx are sometimes the best.,1102464000,31,393,4.077922077922078

The special effects are the stop motion type Ray is famous for. And while the younger crowd may find these old fashion, those of us who grew up with these films will not be disappointed. Like the Saturday Matinee's of oold, just sit back and enjoy.

2163308,5,B00062IVPI,"Anyone who buys this particular collection and can't believe that three of the films are in B&W cannot possibly consider themselves Harryhausen fans when its clear that colorized versions are available seperately in single form, and the two originally shown in color are included as is. Besides, I prefer the original forms much like I choose to watch Beast from 20,000 Fathoms in original B&W only.  I do not need to see another greenish monster. So, I am getting this set with no preconcieved ideas that these are digital colorized enhanced remasters, but the original films that made Harryhausen great!",1263513600,7,605,5.05
2163309,5,B00062IVPI,"Great compilation of Ray Harryhausen's earlier films. I'm a huge fan, but never got to see these in their entirety. Great set, a must own!",1260144000,,138,4.56
2163310,3,B00062IVPI,"It's important to recognise that these are 1950s/early 60s sci fi, and not the best sci fi, either. But at $6 a disk you get several hours of silly fun for your money; and the special effects are at points impressive - not because they are fantastic, but because some of them are pretty remarkable given the limited resources that were available. The flying saucers in Earth Vs. are really pretty good. In First Men the effects are good enough to blend into the background (almost) and let you focus on the story and the acting (which turns out to be a mistake, given the deliberately campy acting.)

In terms of the actual movies themselves... First Men is chock full of silly, and at points irritating, overacting and desperate grabs for cheap laughs. It doesn't quite work. But Earth Vs. takes itself seriously, and does well at being a solid sci fi tale. Mysterious Island is a strange mismash of Jules Verne and Robinson Crusoe, mostly the latter. It's notable for the absurdly short skirt they stuffed the heroine into. The remainder are solidly in B movie territory. If you want to see Washngton DC, the Golden Gate bridge and other noteworthy locales smashed up, these are your films. 20 Million is actually quite sad; the alien gets your full sympathy from the first moment he's on screen.

In all of them, scientific accuracy gets a big fat zero, putting them solidly below many other sci fi flicks of the era, which is saying something. (First Men, as a novel, makes an attempt at it, though it had fantastic elements as well. As a movie, almost all of that is eliminated.) These movies are about special effects first and foremost, story second, and science nowhere.

I'll probably re-watch Earth a few times. The others will make good gag gifts.",1249257600,4,1758,4.68284789644013
2163311,4,B00062IVPI,I have always been a great fan of this gentleman's work. Good to see attention(long overdue) being given to this innovative master animator. I was facinated to learn the involvement of his parents in his early projects and it was heartening to see the unconditonal support they gave him. Would have liked to see different documentaries on each disc but it would appear the dvds were not meant to be part of a set oiriginaly. Technically (sp?) great stuff with some truly corny acting. Thanks once more for a great product!,1236643200,2,522,4.747252747252747
2163312,5,B00062IVPI,"I am 35 and remember watching this stuff on sat or sunday afternoons. It really took me back to those days and INSTANTLY made me a HUGE fan of Ray Harryhausen! There is a documentary of sorts on one or all of the dvd's that is fascinating regarding the pioneer of stop motion fantasy films. I am now collecting every thing I can from this guy, and similar ones, and having a blast. If you love Clash of the Titans like I do, (Rays last movie) then you will LOVE these. Hope they take you back the way they take me back. OH and I am a private Nanny and show these to the kids, and my own kids AND THEY LOVE THEM!! In the age of 3D animation and high tech this and that..it brings a smile to my lips to see that this old stuff is still entertaining Aaaalll these years later.

2163313,5,B00062IVPI,"I had forgotten how great these old stop motion films were.  I really enjoyed them and am very glad to have them in my collection.  ""First Men in the Moon"" is almost Disney-esque in it's quality.  The color and cinematography are truly great.  Of course, they don't equal modern day animation or special effects but when you consider what was available in 1964 you have to be impressed.  When you consider the painstaking work involved in making of these films in stop motion and how difficult it was, all of these movies are works of art.  The special feature at the end of ""First Men in the Moon"" is interesting and informative.  These are all must have movies for any collector of sci-fi of the 50's and 60's.",1236038400,,712,4.515625
2163314,5,B00062IVPI,"These films,were in fact filmed in either 1,85 or 1,66,both Widescreen for the cinemas.

2163318,3,B00062IVPI,"When I was a kid growing up in the sixties, I saw every one of these films at one time or another, usually on late night TV shows hosted by entertainingly campy personalities going by names like Count Gregor or 3-D Danny.  At the time, the Harryhausen films registered as unforgettable, cinematic masterpieces, the likes of which, I was certain, could never be replicated.  And, in a way, I was correct.  After hastily purchasing the Harryhausen collection, I excitedly put each DVD into the slot, expecting, I guess, to recapture some of the adventurous spirit the films had represented in my youth.  The end result, of course, is that Harryhausen's painstaking animation and special effects still hold up remarkably well, even in this age of (often ghastly) CGI effects.

The problem I have is with the stories--and maybe this is just me having grown accustomed to sci-fi and adventure movies clipping along at a breakneck pace.  But the obligatory set-up at the beginning of most of the films seems to drag on and on (""Mysterious Island"" and ""20,000,000 Miles to Earth"" are the exceptions, and in my opinion, the most exciting films of the lot).  This isn't really the fault of Ray Harryhausen since the infinitely boring prelude to the action is an element present in almost every film of this ilk produced in the 1950's.  It's necessary, I suppose, but I can only assume that I must have been a much more patient child than I am as an adult.  Ultimately, I remembered most of these films as being more fun than they actually are, but maybe it's because I've outgrown them.  They're certaily worth viewing for the special effects, if not much else.",1203638400,2,1652,4.764912280701754

We have an entire library of films of this genre--sci fi and horror from the 50's and 60's and we were thrilled to see that we did not have any duplicates from this set already on our shelves.  Ray Harryhausen films are thoughtful, well-made, intelligent and fun to watch--they are multi-layered and there are real characters that you will get to know and like as you watch each movie.  He was the perfect choice to put HG Wells books on film.  And if you are anything like us, you will watch these movies again and again.

2163322,4,B00062IVPI,"All was excitingly great. Though I am a great fan of the sci fi 50-60 era. It takes alot of talent to make monsters and special effects back then compared to today which those now that make movies are spoiled because they get to depend on computerized special effects. Harryhausen in indeed as in my opinion was excellent not just for that time but even for today. The movies where all well acted and the stories where interesting. I really enjoyed everyone of them,and a great deal to get them together. One would probably pay alot more separately. Nina",1199059200,,554,4.606060606060606

2163324,4,B00062IVPI,"I greatly enjoyed these films as a kid, which would come on every so once in a while and were a wonderful treat.  The scripts of these are pretty good, though when seen from the standpoint of our era of relativism, they can seem a bit one-dimensional.

I would say they fall into categories.  First, there are shoot-em-up monster flicks.  These (It came..., Earth v...) are not complex or very sophisticated films, but they do strive to have some interesting characters.  Earth v., I admit, has rather flat acting, but I did like the scientist-hero guy.

Second, there are really good scifi films, Mysterious and 20 Million:  these have good characters and actors set in pretty complex plots.  Mysterious is the best of the lot in my view, and I throughly enjoyed it as did my kids.  20 is also good, as the viewer does feel some for the monster.  They are both scary and keep the viewer wondering what and why the whole time.

Third, there is the zany First Men, which features a silly genius type and a subtly bizarre civilization on the Moon.  Alas, it was too much of a kids' film for my taste, but then my kids liked it while I could exercise my imagination with the elaborate insect culture.

Of course, what binds them all is the masterful special effects of Harryhausen, which are crude by today's digital standards but really fun and vivid.

Warmly recommended.  This is a set I can share with my kids for years, which I will enjoy too.",1150329600,3,1445,4.525096525096525
2163325,1,B00062IVPI,"Although I am a fan of all the films in this collection, and the quality of reproduction is good, I wound-up trading away three of these five films in anger!  ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"", ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers,"" and ""Mysterious Island"" (none of which were originally filmed in a widescreen process) are all presented in a FAKE ""widescreen"" which does nothing more than essentially cut-off the tops and bottoms of the films as originally presented.  Thus--watching them is like watching the originals through a mail-slot!  As a purist, I consider this to be sacrilege, and my purchase of this collection essentially a complete waste of money!

2163328,4,B00062IVPI,"In the mid-'50s, Columbia released a trio of nifty black-and-white ""monster"" movies:  It Came from Beneath the Sea, Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers and 20 Million Miles to Earth. Aimed squarely at the youth market, each of these films run less than an hour and a half, and are brave and spunky as they feature a human race that always survives and is better as a result of the battles with the monsters. Most importantly, each has spectacular special effects by the master, Ray Harryhausen. In the years before computer-generated graphics, monsters were either created by very sophisticated cartoons, or, in the case of Harryhausen, a technique called ""stop action,"" in which models would be shot a frame at a time; natural movement was suggested by moving the figures slowly, frame by frame. This was time-consuming, painstaking arduous, and for non-fans, pretty cheesy.  But the cheesiness is, in a way, more than half the fun. Populated by such grade B through Z performers as Hugh Marlowe, Faith Domergue and William Hopper, these movies are a comfy as a pair of old slippers and a well-worn robe. These quick morality tales are a hoot and holler; a campy, yet and faintly embarrassing, art form that demands the clich ""so bad that they're good.""",1136160000,5,1247,4.877358490566038

I saw all the movies in this set on t.v. but it is wonderful to have them uncut and widescreen here. They look just as great as when they were first released and are still as much fun. My personal faves are It Came from Beneath the Sea (who cares if the octopus is missing a few tentacles?), 20 Million Miles to Earth and Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers.

2163331,3,B00062IVPI,"These creaky little gems can still pack a punch in the thrills department now and then.  Others have reviewed them, so I'm just going to rate them in order of my favorites.

1. Mysterious Island. (Powerhouse score by Bernard Herrmann. Top FX bits: Killer Crab and Behemoth Bees.  Plus a generally decent cast.  Though the black guy has no love interest, of course, since the film was made in the early 1960's.)

2. First Men in The Moon. (Not as much stop-motion stuff, but Lionel Jeffries is lively as the eccentric inventor, and there's some charm to the whole project.  Top FX scene: the moon vessel takes off!)

3. 20 Million Miles to Earth. (Ray's ""King Kong"" homage, set in Rome.  The giant alien is a unique design, and imho the best FX bit is the alien's ""birth"" from its gelatin egg.  Well-paced little flick.)

4. Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. (Standard '50's sf, but a neat and tidy picture with lots of pre-cgi destruction FX.)

5. It Came From Beneath the Sea. (Typical of its time, with the exception being the five-tentacled Beast to provide some visual interest. If you're in a drive-in mood.)",1107302400,14,1109,4.635897435897436
