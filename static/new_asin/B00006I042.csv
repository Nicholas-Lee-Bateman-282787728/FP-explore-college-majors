1762515,4,B00006I042,"This probabably deserves a half-star, but within the context of all time stinkers -- I'll give it 4 stars.  Shatner is over the top. But you knew that. The opening scene where he ropes a cow, and then his sister-in-law (his brother is dead and something may or may not be budding between the two), sets the stage for howlers to come. Shatner is in full middle-aged TJ Hooker mode, looking vigorous as he can, running, roping, and burning spiders. The real winner in this film is not the spiders -- but the script, which is really (and unintentionally)funny.  Shatner tells his (other)lady to sit in the car -- repeatedly, to get the hammer and nails, and of course to eat, also repeatedly.  And all after she has made pains to point our her feminist credentials upon her arrival in spiderville. But that was before she met a real man in Captain Kirk (in what must of been his first toupee).  In many ways this movie rips off The Birds, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Night of the Living Dead, and no doubt others, but in doing so stakes out stinky turf that is truly its own.",1067558400,,1076,4.446700507614213
1762516,4,B00006I042,"This is campy at it's best.....but sooo worth the watching!  I spotted this gem of a DVD in the Halloween section of my local Wal-Mart and just had to have it!  I remember watching this one in the late 80s....and it is sooo good for a ""cult"" flick.  The spiders are pretty creepy....and the acting is wwwwwaaaayyyy over the top!  I am sure glad to see this one on DVD!",1066867200,,368,4.214285714285714
1762517,4,B00006I042,"Kingdom of the Spiders starts off a little shakily, but it gradually evolves into a creep-fest of great, eight-legged proportions.  I don't know how many tarantulas there are in the world, but I'm pretty sure at least 95% of them were cast in this movie.  As with any Shatner film, you get the bonus of having two movies in one.  At one level, this film is all about gigantic spiders run amuck, but it also serves as an excuse for Shatner to work his magic on the ladies.  Interestingly enough, Marcy Lafferty, Shatner's wife at the time, has a role in the film playing the sister-in-law of he-man veterinarian ""Rack"" Hansen (Shatner).  It's a strange role; a widow for two years, she seems quite taken with ""Rack"" and the two even engage in a little lasso fun on the farm until she mistakenly calls him by his dead brother's name, but later on, he rather blatantly flaunts another woman, entomologist Diane Ashley (Tiffany Bolling) in her face.  But I digress.
This film is really all about the spiders.  The first victim is a poor rancher's prize calf, the one sure to win first prize at the upcoming fair.  Unsure of the cause of death, ""Rack"" sends samples to the university in Flagstaff; soon Diane Ashley shows up to tell him the death was due to spider venom.  Folks don't want to believe such a far-fetched thing at first, but these tarantulas are all business and not a bit shy about it.  A huge spider hill is found on the rancher's property, which our heroes attempt to burn (forgetting to burn both sides of it, though); this apparently makes the spiders a little mad, and the full-scale invasion of town is soon launched.  Our heroes find themselves holed up in a cottage in the middle of nowhere; surrounded by spiders all over the place, the chances of their survival appear to be worse than slim to none, all of which leads up to a somewhat unusual but more than acceptable ending.
If you don't like spiders, you don't want to watch this movie.  I mean, there are tarantulas everywhere; I was more than ready for this film to end three-fourths of the way through it.  I don't mind spiders that much, as long as I am only watching them appear somewhere else, but this movie puts so many spiders on the screen you start wondering if some of them will fall through your monitor or TV screen.  For this type of critter invasion film, Kingdom of the Spiders works incredibly well.  While there are a few weak spots in the plot, the filmmakers succeed remarkably well by going all out in terms of making the viewing experience as spiderific as possible.",1066262400,,2563,4.541304347826087
1762518,5,B00006I042,"First off, let me say that, yeah there are a few problems with this movie. However I love it. Its extremly creepy, Probably the creepiest of the spider vs. human movies i have seen. The thing that makes it even more creepy is the ending that i think the director intended. Now i am about to sound crazy to some people, or i might be stating the obvious, but i truly think that the ""guy"" speaking on the radio in the end, is a spider. Think of it, he is very calm, and plays a song (forgiving the country style) that welcomes the audience to the ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" with a song titled ""A Great Place to Live In.""  To me, it all fits, and to me it adds a huge demention of creepiness to it...Thank you for your time, just some food for thought.",1062028800,,747,4.116438356164384
1762519,5,B00006I042,"Gotta love Captain Kirk in Arizona! Terrific stuff. If only ""Night of the Lepus"" was available to complete my collection!",1053648000,,121,5.1
1762520,4,B00006I042,"Though many may want to rush to judgment on this picture because of the title and the cast that would be a gross injustice.  'Kingdom Of The Spiders' is an all too rare achievement in the science fiction sub genre of insects on the rampage.  It is surprisingly well-done, dwelling more on building suspense than spotlighting spider attacks - though there are plenty to be seen here.  The spiders in this case are tarantulas and they are normal size, which is a refreshing change of pace.  A perfectly chosen cast and great outdoor photography are other assets to this thrilling B movie.
William Shatner heads the cast and is most effective as the easygoing veterinarian Rack Hansen; Woody Strode is convincing as a livestock breeder, Colby, whose ranch becomes the launching grounds for the spiders' invasion; Tiffany Bolling portrays entomologist Diane Ashley, who arrives from the University of Arizona to assess the potential problem of the spiders; all the remaining roles are filled by familiar B movie supporting players, most notably Marcy Lafferty, Shatner's then-wife, playing his sister-in-law.  In fact the actors who depict the 'local yokels' are all quite colorful adding an extra touch of realism to the proceedings.
The plot moves along neatly with Colby finding a prized calf near death and contacting Hansen for a diagnosis and hopeful treatment. After the calf dies mysteriously Hansen sends it's blood out for analysis that results in a visit from Ashley.  She becomes convinced that the spiders are organizing attacks on the animals because of a shortage in their food supply, which is caused by the use of DDT and other insecticides.  The tarantulas have built up immunity against the insecticides and as the townspeople try to think of other options to battle them the spiders begin their assault...
The spiders' attacks on animals and humans are done very well - they're not played for laughs or over played to the point of ridiculous.  The web spinning effect is also a superior special effect that is presented with moderation.  The only liability of the film is it's somewhat predictable nature.  When Colby is attacked in his truck you see it coming beforehand; and the same thing for the demise of the crop-dusting pilot and the ending, which seems derivative of the horror classic 'Night Of The Living Dead'.
Some final notes: The film is presented here in standard full frame, free of errors and looks great, although a widescreen treatment would have been preferable.  The cover case is only an artist's rendering of two separate scenes and is not a still from the film.  Probably because of it's Southwestern US setting the opening and closing credits have a country & western song playing over them, which is very unusual for this type of film.  The music however is very pedestrian sounding and although it doesn't hurt the movie's impact frankly it doesn't help it at all either.",1038960000,,2914,4.958932238193018
1762521,4,B00006I042,"A good B-movie/cult film always has certain elements that make it enjoyable.  Kingdom of the Spiders even has a great B-movie title.
Harkening back to the time when films like this were made at a fantastic rate, KOS is the cream of the crop.  An actually quite intelligent movie that has good special effects for its time, this is very entertaining movie that doesn't cop out during its entire running time.
While William Shatner is known for giving outrageous and campy performances, e.g. T.J. Hooker, The Wrath of Khan (Khan!  KHAN!!!), he gives the ultimate B-movie performance.  The supporting cast is less capable, but being the name, Shatner entertains like he is supposed to.
The spiders are the real draw though, and they're actually quite well done, but nothing like the realistic spiders in a movie from today like Eight Legged Freaks.
Overall, this is highly entertaining shlock that will be sure to give you enjoyment.  Also, the ending is brilliant.",1036281600,2,962,4.950310559006211

1762551,4,B00006I042,"I consider this the JAWS of normal-sized killer spider movies (and there have been plenty, such as KISS OF THE TARANTULA - 1972; TARANTULAS: THE DEADLY CARGO - 1977; ARACHNOPHOBIA - 1990; IN THE SPIDER'S WEB - 2007). Why do I love this film so much, you may ask? Well, because real tarantulas (thousands of them) were used and all the actors had to endure them crawling all over their bodies, even biting them at times (William Shatner tells a good story on an extra on the DVD about him being covered with tarantulas while wearing a silk shirt and he could feel their claws as they crawled up his body!) and even though Shatner claimed very few actual spiders were killed in the film, from what I saw, it looked like an awful lot were snuffed out!. The premise is simple: veterinarian Rack Hansen (Shatner), who is taking care of his dead brother's wife Terry (Marcy Lafferty, who was married to Shatner at the time) and niece Linda (Natasha Ryan), after his brother is killed in the Vietnam War (Terry and Rack almost have a romantic interlude until she calls him his brother's name!) is called to the farm of Walter Coby (Woody Strode; SCREAM - 1981) and his wife Birch (Altovise Davis; WELCOME TO ARROW BEACH - 1973; and one-time wife to Sammy Davis Jr.) because their prized heifer looks like it was bitten by snakes and had died. Rack sends a sample of the heifer's blood to a local University and scientist Dr. Diane Ashley (Tiffany Bolling; BONNIE'S KIDS - 1972) and her Mercedes travel to Rack's town of Verde Valley (where a Festival is to take place in a couple of weeks) and accidentally meets Rack at the local gas station and mistakens him for the gas jockey (the entire sequence is funny because Shatner is very charming in this film and doesn't do his typical word cadence, where he pauses between words). When Rack and Diane meet properly, she tells him that the heifer was not bitten by snakes at all, but hundreds of spiders, tarantulas to be specific. They head for Walter's farm (the town's Mayor Connors [Roy Engel] is more concerned about a quarantine being put into place, destroying any chance of holding the Festival. Sound familiar?), where Walter and Birch show them a giant spider mound. Diane is surprised that different species of tarantulas are not fighting with each other (and cannibalizing each other), but getting along like good neighbors. Diane theorizes that because of the use of DDT (Remember that fiasco? If not, Google it), the spiders have adapted to it, but their food sources have been killed in the process. She then goes on to say that because the spiders have lost their food sources, they have adapted to new food sources, namely animals (there have been over 30 missing animals reports in the last month alone). Rack, Diane and Coby decide to burn down the mound when Coby's prized bull is killed by the spiders, but when they set fire to the mound, the spiders have a back door getaway. As Rack and Diane begin a romantic relationship (much to Terry's dismay), the spiders attack Coby in his truck and he goes over the side of the road, When Rack, Diane and Sheriff Smith (David McLean) make it down to Coby's truck, they discover that Coby is covered in a web cocoon. The Mayor makes the decision to use a powerful insecticide (to Diane's objections) on the spiders when 20 to 30 more spider mounds are found scattered throughout the countryside, so he hires The Baron (Whitey Hughes) to fly his plane and spray the affected areas. Little does The Baron know is that the plane is covered inside with tarantulas and before he can really begin spraying the insecticide, he is attacked (and he yelps out the girliest man-scream I have ever heard!) and crashes his plane into the garage of the gas station, where it explodes into a ball of fire (This portion of the film has a lot of realism, because you can see that Shatner, Bolling, Hoke Howell, who plays the mechanic/gas jockey, and other actors in the film, were actually there when the plane crashes and explodes and no stunt people were involved. That took a lot of guts for everyone involved.). Our heroes become trapped in the Washburn Lodge, run by Emma Washburn (Lieux Dressler; TRUCK STOP WOMEN - 1974) and occupied by her only other two guests, Vern & Betty Johnson (Joe Ross, Adele Malis). They try to cover up all the entrances that the spiders can come through (the air conditioning vents, the fireplace and other entry points), but they have a hard time keeping the hordes of tarantulas out. The Sheriff decides to check out the town, only to find out that it has already been overrun with spiders, as he spots people in web cocoons on the side of the road and people running in terror with spiders all over them (it is quite the event, but not the Festival they were expecting!). The sheriff dies when a car veers out of control and takes out the two front legs of the water tower and it falls directly on the Sheriff's car (Birch is also killed when her home is overrun with spiders and she nearly blows off her hand shooting a pistol at a spider residing there and Terry dies while saving Linda). When the spiders take out the lodge's electricity by shorting out the fuse box in the basement, Rack goes downstairs to fix it. He does, but then a ton of tarantulas break the window above him and jump all over his body (it's quite the sight) as Rack barely makes it up the stairs and gets medical attention from Diane. As the sun rises and the spiders have seemed to stop their attack, Rack decides to remove a board on a window and is horrified at what he sees: the entire town is one giant spider cocoon. What can they do next? Well, there was supposed to be a sequel made (according to Shatner's interview), but it never happened.  This is probably director John ""Bud"" Cardos' (THE DAY TIME ENDED - 1979; THE DARK - 1979; NIGHT SHADOWS - 1984; SKELETON COAST - 1987) crowning achievement because it is suspenseful without being bloody (unless you have a fear of spiders; then you will be s***ting your pants!) and the storyline (screenplay by Richard Robinson and Alan Caillou; THE LOSERS - 1970) puts almost everyone in the cast with a chance to be covered with spiders (even Cardos' son, Jon-Jon, who we see in the town, is crawling on the pavement with spiders all over his body). If you like horror films from the 70's that cross the boundaries of good taste, you can't do much better than KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS. I use to have a deadly fear of spiders, but now that I don't, I can appreciate this film on its own merits. No CGI. Everything practical, including all the spiders being real. And there are a whole lot of spiders! Also starring Bill Foster, Jay Lawrence, Bettie Bolling (Tiffany Bollings' mother) and Juanita Merritt. The only true way to watch it (as of this writing) is the anamorphic widescreen DVD (with a ton of extras, including the aforementioned Shatner interview) from Shout! Factory. Rated PG, but this is a 70's PG-Rating, not the pansy PG-Rating of today.",1433635200,2,7006,4.586921850079745

""Kingdom of the Spiders"" is the kind of film that probably scared you stiff as a kid. Even as a teenager, you probably liked it - provided you were a somewhat uncool teen around 1977, when this classic (starring William ""Captain Kirk"" Shatner) was originally released.

The plot is relatively simple: a quiet small town somewhere in Middle America is besieged and attacked by thousands of tarantulas gone mustang. Apparently, DDT has killed off their natural prey, so the hairy arachnids band together in ant-like colonies, preying on cows, pets and (surprise) humans. Weirdly, they also have five times more noxious venom.

All the usual stereotypes are in there: the cold female scientist warmed up by the local hero, the silly mayor who refuses to listen to science, vicious attacks on cute kids and nice grannies, and the final mega-attack on the town itself. The only thing missing is the happy ending. ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" ends with the *spiders* winning, spinning a gigantic cocoon all around the town, and (presumably) planning new excursions into the rest of Arizona...and the world?

This production is too slow paced for my tastes, but I'm willing to give it the OK rating. Besides, I *told* you DDT wasn't good for our collective health, didn't I? :D",1368748800,,1301,4.981566820276497

1762582,5,B00006I042,"*****SPOILERS*****

I love spiders. for a time, i had a pregnant black widow in a jar on my desk in virginia. after she made her egg sac, i released her and her unhatched brood back into the wild. in 1990, a friend who could no longer keep her, gave me his 4 year old tarantula. i'm looking at her right now, as she, alice, resides in a 20 gallon aquarium in our dining room. i spent many nights chasing tarantulas through the jungle in costa rica. i have two tattooed on my person. spider-man is the bomb. i love spiders.

i also remember, back in the summer of 1980, catching kingdom of the spiders, which came out in 1977, on tv. little did i realize that this was the beginning of a beautiful relationship, the melding of two of my favorite things--pulpy horror/science fiction movies and animals eating people. i was already a humongous star trek fan, so to see captain kirk battling hordes of beautiful tarantulas was just a breathtaking experience. and even though the idea of being covered with spiders is not remotely unsettling to me, i believed that shatner and the other town folk of verde valley were not excited about the prospect.

from the very beginning, kingdom of the spiders establishes a creepy--and honestly, patient--descent into death by spider, and like the poor frog being boiled alive slowly, the town does not realize how dire their situation until it is too late. first the crickets go silent, then all the pets disappear, and finally crop-dusters fall out of the sky, trucks careen off the roads, and people begin to get overwhelmed by what are otherwise shy and retreating, fragile, virtually harmless creatures. of course, much like the residents of amity island, the town is between a rock and a hard place, as the spiders have arrived just before the annual some-kind-of-festival-that-leads-to-everyone-getting-killed. the end, while not executed perfectly from a matte painting point of view, is sold to the hilt by the beloved shatner, who utters his lines with as much gravitas as can exist in the world.

and this is one of kingdom of the spider's great strengths: it's cast. william shatner is, of course, magnificent. playing a small town vet, he is just pitch perfect--crazy-dramatic, weird, thoughtful, flexible, and heroic. we all know how great william shatner is; let's talk about tiffany bolling. playing the self-assured entomologist diane ashley, she is just superb. she is commanding, and has no difficulty standing up to the charismatic shatner (at least until he turns on the charm). in one of the best scenes in the movie, diane is ""stalked"" by a tarantula while she takes a shower in what is constructed like a typical stalk and kill scene. however, when she discovers the tarantula, she greets the spider warmly, picking the spider up, talking to her with the fearlessness and compassion one would expect of an entomologist. then she takes the spider outside and releases her. no fear, no anger. beautiful. and despite her quivering hand, tiffany bolling sells the scene completely. woody strode, college football teammate of jackie robinson's and also a barrier-breaking professional athlete in the 40's, is awesome as farmer walter colby, whose farm is at the epicenter of the arachno-crisis' emergence. altovise davis is energetic and sincere as mrs. colby, and she participates in one of filmdom's most memorable scenes, involving her hand, a tarantula, and a gun. the entire cast is believable and entertaining, embodying the vibe of a small town, it's joys and concerns.

the movie, directed by bud cardos, looks great and moves along at a perfect pace. the mystery of what is happening is given time to develop, and when it gets rolling, kingdom of the spiders doesn't stop. the music is excellent, mostly stock (you might recognize the hyper tense music in the movie from episodes of the twilight zone, such as to serve man), but used to great effect, as well as tickling piano keys, which sound just like a spider's walk might. i also appreciate that diane ashley makes clear who is at fault--us, and our environmentally unfriendly, selfish, greedy, insensitive ways. this is 70's environmental/animal revenge at it's very best.

my only complaint with this movie is that real tarantulas were clearly killed. these are animals that can live a long time and must navigate many dangers to make it to adulthood. tarantula populations in the wild have suffered mightily over the years, and it is a shame to see them used so callously. the movie was made in 1977, and there surely were no limitations on the way movie makers had to treat invertebrates. also, tarantulas have a terrible, but completely undeserved reputation. their bites are painful, but like bee stings. they prefer to be left to themselves. i do appreciate that the movie speaks to these issues, and explains why the spiders are not behaving normally, i just wish they had treated their extraordinary eight-legged cast members with greater care. so, please be sure to discuss these issues with your kids.

kingdom of the spiders is a watchable, well-made b-picture, that also features both interesting environmental and race politics. it plays upon the basic fears of many, while reminding us that, as malcolm x suggested when trouble comes to our doorstep, the chickens are merely coming home to roost.",1354233600,5,5329,4.947486033519553
1762593,3,B00006I042,"""Kingdom Of The Spiders"" certainly isn't a ""bad"" late 70's B-Grade ""nature run amok"" film. But, in all honesty, it's just not all that great, either!!!

There are many reviews which already outline the story and major plot points, so I will refrain from bogging you down with repetitive description or the ""re-hashing"" of primary themes from this movie. Rather, I would simply like to offer my opinion on the overall ""quality"" and ""entertainment"" level of this particular film. I hold the viewpoint, that most persons watching this movie for the first time will likely find it to be somewhat entertaining, but not necessarily spectacular or overly intriguing in any pronounced way. This film plays out as a very typical, average B-Grade popcorn flick without anything overly ""flashy"" or ""special"" along the way. While Mr. Shatner does a fine job portraying his character, and who happens to be the primary person of focus to which nearly everything else in the film revolves, the reality is that his character just isn't all that ""likeable"" for various reasons (which you will clearly recognize). Many persons watching this movie would likely be more curious as to how the movie ends, than as to whether or not William Shatner's character finds a safe and positive resolution for himself. ""Most"" current day, lower budget sci-fi (or ""Syfy"") channel productions airing on Saturday night during prime time, would be found as more interesting and have a more developed story arc. I am simply offering my honest opinion, I am not trying to offend anyone.

For William Shatner fans, . . . he has certainly been involved in better work. Of course, we all know that he is most well known for his ""Star Trek"" television and film work. Beyond that, nearly ANY episode of ""TJ Hooker"" is likely to be more substantial and entertaining when compared to this film, if your primary wish is to enjoy Mr. Shatner's on screen presence. The character of ""Rack"", played by Mr. Shatner in ""Kingdom Of The Spiders"", comes across as very brash and cocky, rather than simply being confident and endearing. I'm just letting you know in advance, if you haven't yet watched this film.

The creative use of many live tarantula spiders may be the most intriguing aspect of this film, and there certainly are some reasonably impressive moments resulting on screen (involving the spiders). Additionally, there are some ""ironic"" humor type moments sprinkled throughout, some of which probably weren't intentional. However, the overall story plays out without much intricate plot detail, and the character development happens to be extremely minimal, at best. The movie ending seems to come very abruptly when compared to the ""lead up"" within the prior scenes. It almost seems, that the ""easy way out"" toward conclusion of the film had been taken. While this film can certainly be considered as ""entertaining"" enough to watch from start to finish, MANY PERSONS MAY FIND ONE OR TWO VIEWINGS TO BE ENOUGH.

The picture and sound quality of the 2003 dated (GoodTimes) DVD release seems to be plenty adequate, when the overall film quality is considered. This earlier DVD release offers ""decent"" color display and resolution clarity, even being the full screen version and when displaying in widescreen stretch mode. When using a nice upscaling player, and viewing on a decent quality HDTV, the picture quality is probably a ""7.5"" out of ""10"", which would likely seem to be just fine to most casual viewers of this film. The ""Mono"" soundtrack is very simplistic, but once again, perfectly ""adequate"" for most persons watching this movie. This is a very typical and average ""B"" Grade nature horror flick from the 70's. And, I'm just not convinced, that the enhanced picture and sound of the 2010 dated ""special edition"" version would necessarily offer a much better entertainment experience for the casual viewer, or change someone's overall opinion of the film. The 2003 dated (GoodTimes) DVD release can currently be purchased for approximately one half (or less) of the price of the 2010 dated ""Special Edition"" version of the DVD. Once again, many persons would likely find one or two viewings to be plenty for this particular film.

1762596,4,B00006I042,"Kingdom of the Spiders(1977) was one of the many ""nature run amok"" movies of the 1970's. The film also tries to emulate Jaws(1977) and The Birds(1963). William Shatner acted in this film between Star Trek(1966-1969), Star Trek The Animated Series(1973-1974), and Star Trek The Motion Picture(1979). Shatner's wife at the time, Marcy Lafferty, plays his on screen sister in law. In Kingdom of the Spiders, aggressive tarantulas from Central America invade a town in Arizona and start violently attacking people! What makes Kingdom of the Spiders suspenseful is the fact that over 50,000 real tarantulas were used. Today's filmmakers would resort to CGI spiders. Shatner plays Dr. Rack Hansen, an animal doctor who tries to fight back against the spider invasion. Tiffany Bolling plays an entomologist who helps Rack Hansen. Woody Strode plays a farmer and his cattle are the first victims of the spider invasion! The music score in Kingdom of the Spiders is stock music from The Twilight Zone. This film is scary, but also unintentionally funny at times. A woman shoots her hand with a gun in an attempt to shoot a spider! A crop duster pilot screams like a woman as dozens of spiders bite him!
 I first saw Kingdom of the Spiders(1977) on a local TV station in 1988. The film scared me and I asked my parents to change the channel. My parents laughed at me and refused to change it. The scene where the crop duster crashes must have been an homage to North by Northwest(1959). Natasha Ryan plays Marcy Lafferty's on screen daughter. It's so chilling when she witnesses the tarantulas killing her mother! Director John ""Bud"" Cardos did a solid job directing. Kingdom of the Spiders does treat us to some humor before all hell breaks loose. The film ends with a shocking ending that I'll leave as a surprise. In an interview with Shatner, he claims that the producers planned on making a sequel. So far, a sequel or remake to Kingdom of the Spiders has never materialized. The 1990 film Arachnophobia is similar to this film. Kingdom of the Spiders is a cheesy sci-fi/ horror movie that's fun to watch with popcorn and soda pop.",1345248000,6,2126,4.808743169398907

1762601,4,B00006I042,"If you want to see William Shatner do a freak-out scene over spiders, then peep KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS, a cult classic creature feature thriller from 1977. Shatner plays cowboy veterinarian Robert ""Rack"" Hansen who's trying to live down an inferiority complex over a dead brother who was better at everything. Not that any of that matters, really. This film simply needed a name actor and a lead character with some color. Hansen's complex is supposed to make him more interesting. I do like how he got his nickname of ""Rack.""

""There are many theories regarding man's outcome if the insect world were to turn on him. All I can tell you is that in none of them do we come out on top,"" ominously remarks the beautiful (but icy) entomologist Diane Ashley (Tiffany Bolling). Throughout the film Bolling gets to utter the most choice doomsday lines. Another is this: ""Emma, now we don't have a lot of time to explain. But the spiders in the this area - so far only the tarantulas - have organized themselves into an aggressive army."" She's probably tons of fun at parties.

When an Arizona town is plagued by ravenous mutated arachnids, Rack Hansen and Diane Ashley team up to find a solution, and also dabble a bit with romance. But their efforts to investigate an alarming spider hill receive opposition from the scoffing mayor, who refuses to quarantine the ranch on which the spider hill sits. Not that the infestation can be remedied so easily. The creatures begin feeding on the local livestock. But they soon turn their attention to humans.

Piggy-backing off the premise of Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS introduces killer spiders who turn on mankind. Diane the entomologist makes herself useful by providing a credible theory, or as credible as it gets in these B-movie horror flicks. She posits that man's insecticides have created an imbalance in nature, having killed off the spider's natural food source. And so the spiders have adapted, have become increasingly aggressive and ambitious in their eating habits. Results from the lab indicate that spider venom has multiplied to five times its toxicity.

KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS is strictly B-movie fare, but it's terrific cheesy fun. The horror elements rely heavily on the establishing of atmosphere - and the score is vital here - and the willingness of its actors to play along and pretend that having three or four spiders on their person is simply too much to overcome. You gotta give it up to Shatner who had a real-life tarantula glued to his face with spirit gum. It should be pointed out that thousands of actual spiders were used in this flick, and a huge percentage of what you see on the screen are actually live creepy crawlies exploring the actors' bodies. Eeeww.

As seen today, few of the death by spider scenes come off as so harrowing (if they ever were at all). Still, it's fun to watch moments like the pilot of that pesticide-spraying crop duster screaming with girlish frenzy. And there is a shock factor in seeing the spiders' human victims enveloped in webbed cocoons. One of the huge payoff moments features the town gone berserk as the spiders have taken over. Mobs of crazed people aimlessly running around, wreaking destruction, a lot of them festooned with arachnids. But the most chilling image is reserved for the film's parting shot. See this one for Shatner's campy but entertaining performance and if you like well-crafted B-movie horror cinema. Remember, not all spiders are as wise and charitable as the one in CHARLOTTE'S WEB. Most spiders are just hungry bastards.

1762616,3,B00006I042,"Right off the bat, you have to know going in, that ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" is hardly a tour-de-force effort of film-making. It's a low-budget suspense horror film, filled with 70's cheese-tasticness. That said, however, the film does manage to entertain.

William Shatner, the perennial ""cool guy"" every nerd-boy wishes they could be, plays Dr. Robert ""Rack"" Hansen, a vet who's town is soon overrun by the eight-legged fury of millions of tarantulas. It seems the destruction of their usual food supply, by the careless use of pesticides, has caused them to look into a new source of sustenance... humans!

The overall acting in the film is passable, if unremarkable. Even the usually flamboyant stylings of ""The Shat"" are subdued here. There's the attempt to play up some human drama, through a love triangle between Rack, the beautiful entomologist (played by Tiffany Bolling) and the widow of Rack's dead brother (played by Marcy Lafferty). You get a couple of glimpses of Shatner's typical sexual charisma from it, but little else as far as the story goes. In fact, the whole pacing of the story is quite slow for the first 45-55 minutes of the film. This is surely to help set up the film's final act, when the spiders go on their rampage, but it isn't as effective as they probably were intending.

Really, the story and drama hinges on the spider attacks. Building slowly on the creepy feeling invoked by the spiders, watching them move from killing livestock to humans, it does create a sense of eerie tension. It plays to a fear many of us have of creepy-crawly insects and their ability to overwhelm us with sheer numbers. Director John ""Bud"" Cardos does effectively make the spiders into not only a credible threat, but a menacing one, as well. The scene of the townsfolk running in chaotic panic when the spiders begin attacking in force, will surely make most anyone's skin crawl. And the downbeat ending of the film is, without question, one of the best parts of the film. No typical Hollywood ""happy ending"" here, which only helps the movie to retain it's cult status. The film's attempt at a morality tale, by showing that mankind needs to show more respect towards nature, is both heavy-handed and poorly contrived, but that's only to be expected in a b-grade piece of 70's horror.

""Kingdom of the Spiders"" is a fine piece of 70's kitsch-cinema, which doesn't try to make itself out as much more than that. And while it may pale in comparison to other movies about man facing ""nature's revenge"" (like ""The Birds"" or ""Jaws"", just to name a couple), it certainly is worthy of it's place of cult horror status.

1762622,4,B00006I042,"""Kingdom of the Spiders"" has always been one of my favorite horror films, so I've never been able to understand why it has such a bad reputation. Granted, it's the type of movie you'd expect to see lampooned on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" but I have to wonder how many of its detractors have actually seen the film. Most low-budget horror/sci-fi flicks of this type aren't worth watching once, let alone worth owning. But ""KOTS"" isn't one of them - it's well-made, tightly edited, and guided by a surprisingly good script. It's not ""Citizen Kane,"" of course, but it's far better than most movies of its kind.

For those of us who do enjoy ""KOTS"", Shout Factory's DVD is long overdue. Not only do we finally have a good transfer, but there are some great extras, including a commentary track, a collection of home movies shot during the production, and a revealing interview with Captain Kitsch himself, William Shatner. Considering I only paid a few dollars more for this edition than I did for Goodtime's bare-bones release a few years ago, it's well worth the price.

If you're in the mood for a good scare and tired of bogus-looking CGI monsters, ""KOTS"" is definitely worth a look.

1762629,4,B00006I042,"I love this movie. I've enjoyed this film for years after first seeing it on TV back in the 70's/80's. I knew William Shatner as Rack Hansen long before I realized he was better known for piloting a ""starship"". ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" was a staple on my local light night creature feature growing up. I haven't seen it in years, but still vividly remembered it (especially the girl on the swing scene!!!). I finally got around to watching the DVD treatment, and am happy to say it's still a great movie gauranteed to give you a creeping case of the willies.

""Kingdom of the Spiders"" is another 1970's nature-gone-crazy flick. It came out when a plethora of such films were filling movie and drive-in screens every week, movies like ""The Pack"", ""Grizzly"", ""Day of the Animals"", ""The Swarm"" and ""Prophecy"" all featured hapless town folk and tourists meeting the worst nature has to offer. I guess thanks to ""Jaws"" Hollywood saw a chance to make some money and pumped these suckers out left and right. ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" actually works and delivers the chills you would want. How could it not? I mean the movie's premise is that tens of thousands of highly venomous tarantulas are over-running a small town. If you are as creeped out by spiders as I am...you will get goosebumps. And what makes it better is that these are the genuine item, real creepy crawlie spiders...not CGI.

So if you are looking for a fun little movie, one that has some unintentionally funny moments as well as some real chills, you should pick this up. You can't ask for more than William Shatner and 10,000 spiders all trying to share screen time!",1249257600,3,1629,4.652777777777778
1762630,2,B00006I042,"Let's be honest, if someone told you there was a horror movie called ""Kingdom of the spiders"" starring William Shatner you instantly know it's going to be bad. It just seems like the perfect formula for bad movie. Small, isolated town + William Shatner + invasion of deadly spiders = bad movie.

But you really have to know that going into it and so if you're dissapointed by this film then lord I have no clue what more you were expecting to see. It's a simple plot (most horror plots usually are) and it's pretty straightforward. If you're creeped out by spiders than this is a movie you either need to avoid or need to see depending on if you like creeping yourself out.

The picture on the cover really says it all. Shockingly this film is relatively enjoyable but I think you have to be a fan of the genre to say that. It's certainly not the greatest B movie of all time but believe it or not it's not the worst either. The ending scene is also pretty cool. For a better spider movie stick with Arachnaphobia or Eight-Legged Freaks if you like campy, silly horror flicks.

Watch with caution. You have been warned.",1235088000,,1119,4.422330097087379
1762631,5,B00006I042,"When faced with the absolute magnificence one witnesses in this film, it's difficult to find the words needed to express such joy, let alone organize them in any manner. I feel a rush of sensations, all blindly driving my passions into a whirlwind of pleasure.  Yes, the great William Shatner stars in this outing, and his impeccable acting alone is worthy of admission costs, but surprisingly, he is upstaged by two things: hordes of tarantulas stealing the scenes, and the most exquisitely cultivated male scream you will EVER encounter.

In one solitary scene, this movie lays waste to every other cinematic achievement in the history of motion pictures.  The town's mayor has hired a crop-dusting pilot to spray deadly insecticide across the region infested with tarantulas, thus ensuring the annual local fair will proceed as scheduled, but our eight-legged protaganists counter with a deadly plan that transforms the pilot's cockpit into a tomb.  In his final moments, this heroic, godlike vision of a man is swarmed by warmly embracing arachnids, and he unleashes the grandest of all screams.  He continues to evoke his heavenly shrieking for the entire duration of his glorious exit from the realm of the living.  I'm left speechless when attempting to describe the sheer beauty of this scene, but every creature walking this earth is but a mere speck of dust in comparison to the divine frequency unlocked by this man's diaphragm.  This, without question, is the peak of cinematic mastery.

The rest of the movie is not without value either.  The work of William Shatner is a configuration of talent that needs no introduction, for he is admired by the masses, worshipped as an artistic genius, and for his very existence we are all unworthy to serve as viewers.  His role in this movie need not be discussed, for it goes without saying that his time onscreen is comparable to a sultan's ransom in fine jewels.  Only a sheer fool will  deny this.  I am no fool.

I am also indebted to this film for the knowledge it has bestowed upon me.  In the case that I, or my loved ones, were ever to be trapped in a ranch-styled hotel/restaurant blanketed by deadly tarantulas, we are now fully educated with the proper means of survival.  First, and most importantly, if you're carrying a handgun, and a tarantula is biting your opposing hand, the best thing to do is shoot this hand off as gorily as possible.  After evaluating this scenario countless times, I can see no better way to handle the situation.  Second, if a ceiling vent appears to be blocked by tarantulas, the best thing to do is remove the vent while standing directly underneath it, so as to provide a landing space for the falling beasts, as this will better allow you to assess the situation, rather than allowing the spiders freedom to land elsewhere.  The third and final lesson to be mentioned here is that if you're driving, and suddenly realise that tarantulas are crawling across your flesh, the quickest and most logical solution is to drive off the nearest cliff, and pray that flames will consume the scoundrels.

The quality of the dvd release is exceptional.  There is footage present which I had not seen in previous releases, or even on television as a child.  The picture quality is perfect, as well as the audio, and although some will complain about a lack of ""extra"" features, I am more than happy just being able to see the movies I grew up with in pristine shape.  All other movies cower at the mention of this film, and it's impossible to deny this reality.  Perfection is too light of a term to confine the overwhelming qualities of this magical cinematic experience, so rush out and enlighten yourself to the absolute grandeur of KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS.",1233792000,27,3746,4.790046656298601

The invasion starts out slow enough but instead of doing anything productive ol' Shat prefers to mack on all the females and drink a little cold beer.

I live in Arizona and let me tell you that you would be hard-pressed to lose a foot race with a tarantula, even though you have only two feet and they have eight.  They just aren't speedy.  And any bovine that allowed itself to get covered with them could hardly have been very healthy to start.  Oh well.

That's all the information I needed about director John ""Bud"" Cardos's 1977 film ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" to know that I simply had to sit down and watch it. Yep, Shatner and spiders--killer spiders to boot.  I used to blast these nature gone amok movies as rapidly as I watched them. Outside of ""Jaws"" and a few others, spending a couple of hours wading through one of these films meant a couple of hours of sheer agony. Watch ""Shark Attack 3"" if you don't believe me, or ""Crocodile,"" ""Death Swamp,"" or any of the other hundreds of killer animal films clogging the arteries of a video store shelf near you. But something funny happened after I watched the fiftieth film in which a crazed, giant reptile munched down on a batch of teenagers: I began to really like these films even when they're total garbage. I still knock a few of them--Rene Cardona's ""Tintorera"" quickly comes to mind--but these films can be a lot of fun if you'll let them. Besides, even the worst of these sorts of films easily beats watching the dreck on network television. So, my friends, we've got Shatner and spiders on deck for a drubbing. Oh yeah!

Shatner, perhaps the hammiest actor to ever grace the hallowed hills of Hollywood, plays a veterinarian named Dr. Robert ""Rack"" Hansen in ""Kingdom of the Spiders."" Rack! Oh man, I had to pause the disc while I howled for what felt like hours over that one! I soon discovered that laughter and ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" go together like ice cream and cones. The movie tells the story of Rack (giggle) and his adventures in a little town somewhere in Arizona. Hansen is a stand up guy, caring for his deceased brother's widow and child even as he rebuffs the woman's romantic overtures. Whatta guy! He's also a crack critter doc, always ready to jump in the truck and head out to a local farm to make a diagnosis. Rack's problems begin in earnest when local rancher Walter Colby (Woody Strode) and his wife Birch (Altovise Davis) summon the good doctor to check up on a prized cow. Something sinister slunk up on the animal out in the field and attacked it--we know this because we saw the attack unfold in hilarious fashion--and Colby wants a diagnosis. Rack is stumped and sends some samples to the big city, worried that some sort of illness going around might force him to quarantine and kill a lot of the livestock in the area.

When big city bug doctor Diane Ashley (Tiffany Bolling) shows up to tell Rack and the townsfolk that mutant spiders killed the cow, the movie takes off. Our hero soon discovers a huge mound of dirt with spiders spilling out of it on Colby's property, and then discovers a lot more of these mounds later on spread around the desert. How did they get there? Who knows? The film throws around some noise about pesticides or some such nonsense, which makes sense in the environmental madness context of the 1970s, but we're far more interested in seeing Shatner take charge in a Captain Kirk way than worrying about logic. Kirk never appears, sad to say, although we do get some macho posturing and the requisite love interests that Shatner must insist on in every one of his television and film contracts. We also get some really funny spider kills. The reaction of that cow is a scream, but that's only the beginning. These nasty spiders know no limits, and before you can ""There's something on the wing"" they're attacking people with impunity. A crop duster falls from the sky after the pilot learns he's covered in spiders. Then the whole town comes under attack as people lurch and shriek through the streets covered in spiders and webs. Can Rack save the day?

""Kingdom of the Spiders"" is a lot of fun, easily a four star film. I'm docking it one star because the pacing seemed to drag during the first half of the picture, but the last part and the conclusion payoff in a big way. Shatner gives a restrained performance, all things considered. Fortunately, at one point in the film we see Big Bill thrashing around covered in spiders, shrieking and gesticulating wildly in a way that only Shatner could pull off. The rest of the cast does a good job backing Shatner up, with special mention going to Tiffany Bolling and David McLean (playing the Sheriff). The believability factor definitely lacks punch, however. Lots of spiders moving around look good and creepy, and there are points when we see many of them in one place, but it's impossible to believe for a second that people couldn't escape from these critters. I think my favorite part of the film, aside from Rack's spastic anti-spider dance, involved the poor sap who tried to cover up the danger posed by the spiders. His death scene is so over the top, so obviously a punishment for trying to hide the truth, that I couldn't help but laugh.

Yes sir, ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" is required viewing for both Shatner fans and viewers who enjoy these sorts of nature gone wild films. What isn't appreciated is the poor DVD version of the film. No extras I can deal with, although it's always nice to see at least a trailer packaged with the feature presentation. We don't get anything to sink our teeth into here. What's worse, the movie is a full screen transfer with VHS quality. The picture quality isn't as bad as some discs, but the movie could look a lot better in the hands of someone like Anchor Bay or Image Entertainment. Anyway, give ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" a shot if you've a hankering for a heavy dose of cheese.",1128902400,5,5466,4.602051282051282
1762668,3,B00006I042,"I had seen this many years ago on television. Now that I am a more refined and mature aficionado of bad cinema, I thought I might appreciate this film more, so I bought a copy. Actually, I still find the zillions of tarantulas in the film to be quite nasty, and the acting to be of a similar quality.

Shatner is in fine form here as a veterinarian with a ridiculous name (which is explained in a long, yet pointless, story) in a dusty desert ranching town. The town is about the least desirable place on earth to live, so to liven the picture up a bit there are subplots about chemical toilets and a cow in the back seat of a Ford Galaxie 500, among other diversions from the main theme of marauding spiders.

I found it especially amusing that the (supposedly) hot babe scientist from the university who was the most knowledgeable expert on spiders on the planet (and who, of course, is the love interest for Shatner) continuously refers to spiders as ""insects,"" which, of course they are not. (They are arachnids.)

I will give the producers one thing, they certainly found lots of novel ways to get the spiders onscreen (my favorites were the child in the swing scene and the kitchen ventilation scene), but mostly I got a bit bored with the gross little critters after a while.

The movie has some moments of genuine creepiness, but on balance the special effects (especially the cocoons) are laughable, which brings me to the finale. The last, very ambiguous (sequel fodder), scene is one of my favorites of high camp cheese cinema of all time: the matte painting of the town is one of the most poorly executed bits of screen ""magic"" that I have ever seen. In fact, it really is the most enjoyable scene in the entire movie, and is far superior to seeing Bill Shatner endlessly wrestle with rogue arachnids.

I give the film three stars, it is a bit boring and repetitive to be truly great camp cinema, but it does have a few disgustingly creepy spider scenes. There are better and worse movies out there. If you like watching Shatner rave, this is a good choice. If you like endless scenes of tarantulas in great swarms, this is also a good choice. If you want real entertainment this is perhaps not such a good choice.",1125360000,2,2226,4.513647642679901

Kingdom of the Spiders

If you are afraid of the hairy eight legged creepy crawlers, this movie is not for you!  This movie is more or less a role reversal for spiders since they completely took control of an entire town.  In this 1977 film, the secluded town of Verde Valley, Arizona is attacked by a throng of large spiders with unusually toxic venom.  This movie begins with a beautiful, peaceful overview of the Western mountains showing rocks and uninhabited land.  We are first introduced to the Colby's, a farming family who raised livestock.  Things seem normal until a calf, which was grazing in a field, became startled.  It was found the next day to be extremely weak and had whelps covering its body.  The calf finally died, and blood samples were sent off for testing by the town's veterinarian, Dr. Hanson (William Shatner).

As the movie progressed, big spiders similar to Tarantulas were being spotted around the town.  As the tests on the calf were in progress, an entomologist, Diane Ashley (Tiffany Bolling), paid a visit to the town to investigate.  She finally hears that the calf had been killed by spider venom.  Since a single spider could not harm a 200lb calf, it was assumed that dozens of spiders had attacked at the same time.  As time went on, more animals, and finally people, were attacked and were killed by the spiders.  Diane determined that the spiders were experiencing a shortage of food, due to overuse of pesticides, which had turned them into aggressive meat eaters.  On the Colby farm, a spider hill was found that housed hundreds of these deadly spiders.  The hill was burned, but not all the spiders were killed.  Later, many more hills were discovered, which meant the spiders were migrating through the town.

The spiders had the entire town in a scare.  Mrs. Colby's house was invaded and her fear drove her to actually shoot her own hand when a spider crawled on her.  The spiders spread throughout the town and completely took over.  They attacked and killed everything and everyone in sight.  When the spiders killed their victims, they would wrap their bodies in a thick web which formed a cocoon around the entire body in order to store it for food.  One group of determined people began to spray the spiders with a fire extinguisher.  Surprisingly, this actually worked to kill the spiders, or caused them to move away, but for only a short time.  The spiders would leave bite marks on their prey which would swell and turn red.  They seemed to enjoy showing the actual fang holes in the skin.  As the movie ended, the spiders had covered the entire town with silk webbing.

There were both accurate and inaccurate statements regarding spider biology.  It was very strange to have the spiders burrowing in the dirt creating something resembling an ant hill.  The movie portrays the spiders as carnivorous, which is true.  However, in real life they prey on crickets, moths, and flies instead of cattle, rats, and humans.  In the movie, the spiders are extremely aggressive and attack anything living, but in reality they are not aggressive and bite humans only in defense.  Some spiders are toxic.  However, their bite is seldom fatal, but can lead to faintness and difficulty in breathing.  For most spiders, their fangs are usually too small to break human skin and only a few are dangerous to humans.  In the movie, the prey was usually killed and the bite marks were very large and protruding.  The film used real spiders, mostly tarantulas, making the threat seem more authentic.

This movie was interesting and it was suspenseful.  The music selected added a lot to set the mood and to help with foreshadowing.  The movie was also interesting since there was an underlying love story occurring as well as the threat from the spiders.  Diane Ashley and Dr Hanson were attracted to each other and finally accepted that fact and begin to make something of it while trying to halt the spider chaos.  The selection of attractive actors and actresses was helpful in keeping the audience's attention.  The only bad quality of this film was that the ending did not have any resolution.  The movie ended without the audience knowing if the determined group of people survived the takeover of the city by the spiders.  What happened to the few people that were left alive?  In rating this film I had to give it seven stars out of ten due to the fact that it was made in the seventies and it only had a couple of drawbacks.  Overall, I would recommend this film for a good laugh and a creepy crawler scare!",1114128000,2,4635,4.735
1762671,2,B00006I042,"Kingdom of the Spiders (John ""Bud"" Cardos, 1977)

I remember first seeing this movie on television (it must have been its TV premiere, as it was no more than a year after its theatrical release) back in the late seventies and being terrified of it. Well, twenty-five years later, someone decided to release a twenty-fifth anniversary DVD. Mutant tarantulas and Bill Shatner-- how could I resist?

There is a difference between good bad films (Dark Star, for example) and bad bad films (The Beast Within, for example). The best way to delineate it is to call it the Cheese Factor. The higher the cheese factor, the better the movie, pure and simple. (What defines the cheese factor is a matter of discussion. Many people think Attack of the Killer Tomatoes has one of the highest cheese factors on the planet. I am not one of them.) Kingdom of the Spiders has Cheez Whiz coming out its ears. Shatner and his then-wife, Marcy Lafferty (Star Trek: The Motion Picture), seem to be in a race to prove once and for all which of them can out-bad-act the other one. Spaghetti-western staple Woody Strode turns in a performance that would be great if his part weren't so horribly written. Playboy centerfold Tiffany Bolling, as the female lead, turns in the kind of performance one would expect of a Playboy centerfold. The spiders are roughly as terrifying as fruit bats. Even the cows look like they'd rather be in another movie. This, folks, is classic cheese.

It all starts when a rancher (Strode)'s prize calf gets sick. He calls in the local vet, Rack Hansen (Shatner), who's never seen anything like it. He sends some samples up to Flagstaff, who send them back with an entomologist (Bolling) who brings dire warning-- the calf was killed by spider venom. Everyone's concerned that the farm will be quarantined except the mayor (veteran character actor Roy Engel), who's concerned that such a quarantine will ruin the 1977 Verde Valley County Fair, thus setting the scene as so many mayors have done in so many monster movies. You know what's coming next if you've seen any two of them.

Kingdom of the Spiders features absolutely awful special effects (check out the very last scene, especially), truly terrible acting, and a horrid script. About the only good thing one can say about it is that it's perfectly-paced. There's never a moment where the film drags, though it does threaten to a few times at the beginning. Despite all of the above, however, if you're looking for a really good bad movie, pick this up. **",1107734400,2,2518,4.755148741418764
1762672,4,B00006I042,This movie though it is really old is very scary for me both because it is about spiders which I hate and the idea that things could really do this if us humans destroy their food. I have always been scared when watching this movie and will never change. Watch it and see for yourself!!,1098748800,2,286,4.218181818181818
1762683,4,B00006I042,"Cult 1977 low budget ""nature gone haywire"" film with Arizona veterinarian William Shatner ( that's about as far away from the bridge of the USS Enterprise as you can get ! ) firstly investigating unexplained livestock deaths. After Shatner takes bio samples from the dead animals and sends them off for analysis, then enter ice cool blonde entomologist Tiffany Boling to explain the animals are succumbing to massive doses of spider venom. Shattered farmer Woody Strode then shows Shatner and Boling a huge dirt mound seething with hairy, agressive tarantulas, and it soon becomes apparent that something is very wrong with the local spider population !

I first saw this film theatrically upon it's release back in 1978, and 25 + years later, when you stack it up against other ""bugs on the rampage"" films like ""Frogs"", ""It Happened at Lakewood Manor"" & ""The Naked Jungle""....it holds up as one of the best. Sure, its as cheesy as a block of cheddar, and Shatner is a hammy actor, but it's a real guilty pleasure movie and seems to tick along quite well without getting bogged down with boring characterisations, or long winded explanations about why the spiders are now hunting much larger prey !

For my money, all the actors involved in this one deserve bravery awards for sharing the screen with hundreds and hundreds of genuine LIVE Mexican red knee tarantulas. On top of that most of the key cast members ( Shatner, Bolling, Strode, Dressler, Hughes & Lafferty ) get attacked and covered in these creepy arachnids. Nowadays, film makers would just cheat and use CGI effects, but back in low budget productions in 1977, they just tipped a bucket of real tarantulas on the actors and filmed the shot.....YECCH ! Well know Hollywood animal trainer's Lou Schumacher & Jim Brockett who have worked on similar projects such as ""Day of the Animals"", ""Night of the Lepus"", ""Alligator"" & ""Dracula""s Dog"" supplied & wrangled the spiders for KOTS, and I would have asked for a hotel room a long, long way away from Lou & Jims.....lest some of their ""pets"" went out for a stroll.

Although this release by Good Times DVD is only a mono soundtrack and a standard full frame presentation, the print is excellent and the transfer has been done very well. If you're a fan of this genre of horror movie, the ""Kingdom Of The Spiders"" definitely belongs in your DVD collection.",1096675200,25,2365,4.791666666666667
1762684,5,B00006I042,"This one has Shatner in the Captain Kirk mode;against (Gasp) spiders!  Shatner's has many what I call Kirkian moments and reacts just as Kirk would if he was a bad vet who beamed down to a planet of people who didn't have the sense to evacuate the town when they first appeared.  Just like in the movie Jaws they didn't want the people to panic so they stayed there....and wound up as spider food.

Shatner truly phones this performance in as a Kirk/vetnarian. He truly comes from the canned ham school of acting.  All his reactions are well practiced. Worst of all is he thinks he's a leading man on the level of a Cary Grant or today's Tom Cruise.

If you want to see a good campy movie and have a few laughs buy this one from the budget bin.",1096416000,2,744,4.24822695035461
1762685,4,B00006I042,"The quality of this DVD is suprisingly good, considering it's from Goodtimes Video.  Like another reviewer stated, too bad it's fullframe.
This is a entertaining movie.  For the money, I can't think of any reason why you shouldn't get this.  It's just a fun movie.  There must be some reason this movie works and other movie with bigger budgets fail.  I can just imagine the director gathering the cast and crew and telling them, look, I know we're not making Citizen Kane, but let's make a good movie.  Something like that.  The cast all give solid performances and seem to be having fun.  A scene that is typical is when the sheriff tries to tell a woman that her husband is dead.  He is unable with words, he grabs her in silence, hugs her, and the camera views them from the distance.  I didn't expect that.  Kinda moving.",1086480000,9,826,4.513513513513513
1762686,4,B00006I042,"William Shatner as ""Rack"" & Tiffany Bolling as his love interest in this utterly laughable, fun, and cheesy B-horror film from the past.  Shatner's over the top performance as Rack is worth the price of this DVD alone! (Just under a sawbuck!)
The effects are quite UNSPECIAL as well as the acting from the supporting cast.  The Shat, however, more than makes up for ANY marginal acting of the supporting cast.
After Shatner, the best performance in this fun stinker of a movie is ""Bessie"" the cow while being attacked by spiders in the very first scene.  Bessie highly surpasses her owners acting performance and clearly OUTSHINES everyone but Rack in this film.
A great cheese-filled ending to the picture too!
If you like b-grade horror, you will certainly enjoy this ""peice of SHAT"" film!
Happy Watching!",1083542400,17,807,4.875912408759124
1762687,1,B00006I042,"First off, I haven't truly been scared by a movie since I was 3, and that was Terminator 2. So take this review with a grain of salt.
SPOILER ALERT! IF YOU ARE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING WATCHING THIS, *DON'T* SKIP AHEAD!
I'm sorry, but I simply cannot comprehend why anyone would call this a horror film. It's a comedy, through and through. True, Shatner isn't playing Kirk, but it's close enough, and a name like Rack Hansen doesn't help. (More like Rack Beefcake. Every time I think women really want a nice, family man, someone like this shows up, and the girls start fawning. But I digress.)
The plot is ridiculous, to say the least. The besieged villagers only start stomping on the critters in the *last five minutes*, for crying out loud. One moron shoots her own hand off to kill a spider on it, instead of thwacking the back of her hand (and consequently, the spider) against the dresser. Brain scientists need not apply.
And how could I possibly forget the scene where Kirk- er... Rack (snicker) has to cross a field of spiders. He does, by running across the field the way Speed Racer would have if he were on cocaine. (Step, stop. Step, stop. Step, wobble, stop. Painful face.) For that matter, how is Shatner the only person able to survive a bite from one of these spiders?! (Let alone 35!)
If the American public is really as mind-bogglingly stupid as these inbred idiot characters, an Army of Killer SMEGGING TOMATOES would have no trouble...
Oh wait, they made that movie too, didn't they.",1083369600,4,1502,4.629213483146067
1762688,3,B00006I042,"Small, hairy creatures terrorize William Shatner, and I'm not talking about his toupees.  Kingdom of the Spiders (1977), directed by stuntman/actor/director/producer John 'Bud' Cardos who later directed the miserably dismal Outlaw of Gor (1989).  The film stars William `Mr. Tambourine Man' Shatner as Dr. Robert 'Rack' Hansen, along with once aspiring singer and fairly attractive Tiffany Bolling as entomologist Diane Ashley, and Woody Strode as Walter Colby, a small time rancher with big time problems of the hairy, creepy eight legged kind.

The movie starts of with Colby's prize calf becoming sick of `mysterious' causes, but seeing as how the title of this feature is Kingdom of the Spiders, it's no big task for the viewer to assume the spiders got at it, but the characters aren't let in on it until a little later in the movie.  Also, we are given a number of scurrying, point of view shots on the ground near the calf prior to its' becoming ill, indicating that many small, quick creatures had their way with the bovine.  Dr. Robert 'Rack' Hansen, the local veterinarian, is called, and he takes some samples from the dying calf, and sends them off to the `big city' for further analysis.  Thus enters Diane Ashely, entomologist to further investigate the matter, and also to provide a rather awkward love interest subplot for Shatner's character.  She informs Rack that the calf died of spider venom, to which he has a hard time believing, until Mr. Colby speaks of a giant spider mound on his property, one crawling with tarantulas up the wazoo.  Diane is amazed to see such a concentration of spiders in one place, and proposes some rather lame theories to help justify the main crux of the film, namely why thousands, even millions of spiders that are about to descend on the small, Arizona town.  Oh yeah, she also finds out that the spiders have venom like five times more toxic than normal.  Well, some measures, rather futile ones at that, are initiated to try and kill the wee, hairy varmints, but to no avail.  I love how the character of mayor, between a rock and a hard place with concern about an upcoming fair that generates a great deal of revenue for the small town, acts in borderline criminal fashion in dealing with the spiders.  The similarity between this character and that of Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) from the vastly superior Jaws (1975) is unmistakable, but while Mayor Vaughn suffered internally for his folly, the mayor in this film just meets a rather nasty end.  I know it's not fair to compare these two films, as Jaws, in my opinion, is one of the best films ever made which spawned so many copycats trying to cash in on the success of a particular genre, namely man vs. nature.

Shatner hams it up a bit as you might expect, but that added to film for me, rather than detracting.  There was an odd and creepy subplot involving the widowed wife of Shatner's character's brother as a potential love interest, but that was put to rest fairly quickly, to which I was thankful.  The spiders are the main attraction here, and the film certainly doesn't skimp, providing, at times, hundreds of the hairy little creatures, certainly more than enough to give this viewer a serious case of the willies.  I couldn't even begin to imagine having to work around so many live spiders...I give credit to the actors for this point, and it's obvious for the scenes involving a character having to suffer spiders on their person the revulsion was real.  These are the kind of reactions hard to get with CGI work.  My biggest problem was with the music as it didn't always fit and became fairly annoying at times.  It's interesting when music works in a movie, I don't always notice its' presence, but when it doesn't, it really stands out, like it did here for me.  I don't want to give too much away, but I will say the ending was typical of these types of movies throughout the 70's.

Good Times Home Video offers a reasonably good looking print in full screen format, but don't be expecting any special features as there are none, not even a trailer.  For the price, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but given the better than average quality of the picture, I was pleasantly surprised.  If you're in the mood for some good, creepy crawly fun, you could certainly do a lot worse.

1762689,4,B00006I042,"By no means is this movie good.  But, I enjoy watching awful B-movies, and this is one of the best out there.  To me, this movie is more of a comedy rather than a sci-fi/horror flick.  When you sit down to watch the movie, keep a keen eye out for some of these ""highlights""...
1. William Shatner is waaaay more disgusting than any of those spiders.  Check him out putting the moves on the women!  Horrible!  Just watching this guy being a sleazeball jerk is worth the admission alone!
2.  Watch for Mr. Johnson's wife (they're the couple with the RV staying at the lodge).  I have never seen a human being that looks so weird in my entire life.  I wonder if she really is human at all.  She looks like a Muppet!
3.  That poor guy who just keeps getting shafted by the man upstairs.  He loses his prize cow, his dog, his bull, breaks his arm, and dies a horrible death by spiders!  Geez, tough breaks huh?
4.  I rented the VHS version of the film and from what I saw, there wasn't an ending!  There is no resolution to the story.  I won't tell you how it ends but is by no means an ""ending""!  Perhaps it is included with the DVD version...
If you're looking for a serious horror flick, look somewhere else.  If you're looking for a campy, badly-made B-movie than look no further.  I'll definately be buying this movie on DVD and I'll be laughing for many years to come.  By the way, I happen to live in the area in which this movie was filmed (Sedona and Camp Verde, Arizona) and there are tarantulas here, but there has never been a case of thousands and thousands of venemous spider taking over a small town.  At least not yet.....",1077494400,2,1632,4.26797385620915
1762690,2,B00006I042,"In yet another one of those don't-mess-with-Mother-Nature science-fiction flicks, William Shatner plays a small-town veterinarian who, along with a university researcher (Bolling), tries to figure out why thousands of tarantulas have suddenly descended upon Verde Valley, Arizona.  Shatner gives a surprisingly restrained and effective performance, which makes you wonder what he could have done if he hadn't wasted most of his career making all those Star Trek movies.  The apocalyptic, supposed-to-blow-your-mind ending is utterly preposterous, but that's part of what makes this film such a priceless piece of '70s drive-in trash.

If you've read my review for Goodtimes Home Video's edition of Night Of The Living Dead, I bought these two movies in a two pack, and figured it was a great deal. I figured right, as both movies were cool. When I was watching this movie, I had a bad case of the creepy-crawlies and got really itchy. In addition to the killer spiders, there's some cool action scenes (like a plane crash), interesting human drama (between Rack, Diane, and Terry), a message about the environment and a freaky ending.

1762692,3,B00006I042,"""I've never seen anything like it!"" -That must be the most said line in the film!  To be honest I've never seen anything like it either, well maybe a little like it.  Right before Director John ""Bud"" Carlos teamed with Tobe Hooper for ""The Dark"" (1979) he blessed the cheezy b horror film genre with this little number from 1977.  The story, penned by the writer who gave us ""Village of the Giants"" (1965) & ""Evil Knievel"" (1971) as well as the co-writer of a western starring Kenny Rogers!, concerns a small desert farm town being overrun by extremely hungry and ill-tempered tarantulas.  William Shatner leads the cast as Rack Hansen, the town vet with a cowboy hat.  Woody Strode (Draba from Spartacus) plays local farmer Walter Colby who begins losing his livestock to the horrible poisonous spiders! This one has many alluring elements:  Cheese, people being attacked by tarantulas and totally flipping out, country music, thousands of real tarantulas, webs, Shatner not only talking like a cowboy, but also reacting to vicious man-eating spiders like only he could!  Actually, he's not as over the top as Captain Kirk, but like Kirk, Rack manages to put moves on a female amidst all the terror! Definitely recommended for fans of Shatner and of ""the town is being taken over by..."" movies.
The 2002 Goodtimes DVD is impressive for this film.  I rented this on VHS at a video store that doesn't exist anymore and no one else has it. Imagine my surprise when I saw it on DVD! The film is presented in a Standard screen version only with chapter selection, not to mention great keep case art - Shatner kneeling over a woman covered in spiders!  The DVD is inexpensive as Goodtimes DVDs are and if you like it or even think you will, I can recommend it for purchase.  The image transfer isn't perfect (there's the odd jump that's in the orginal film most likely), but face it, its not getting any better than this.  We're lucky to have it on digital at all!  Check out that last shot when Shatner prys the boards off the window and looks out onto the town! Also recommended: Devil's Rain (1975) - Shatner vs. cloaked devil worshipper Ernest Borgnine!  Also a DVD cheapie.  Film debut of John Travolta as Danny, the eyeless & mute devil worshipper!  Tom Skerrit and Eddie Albert decide to join the fight against evil as well!
